    "the nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) weak interaction can be described as arising from meson exchange involving a parity - violating weak vertex and a parity - conserving strong vertex .",
    "this interaction leads to a meson - exchange potential involving seven weak meson - nucleon coupling constants and @xmath6 . ] , of which two , the @xmath7 @xmath8__n _ _ coupling @xmath1 and the @xmath9 @xmath10__n _ _ coupling @xmath3 contribute the most to low - energy nuclear observables .",
    "the coupling @xmath1 is of interest because it is expected to be particularly sensitive to weak neutral currents . in the absence of neutral currents",
    ", @xmath1 is small .",
    "some theories that include neutral currents predict large values of @xmath1 . despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort",
    ", the size of the weak pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath1 remains uncertain . until recently",
    ", the conflict has centered around a discrepancy between theory , which predicts a relatively large value @xmath11 @xcite , and experiments in @xmath2f , which set an upper limit of @xmath12 @xcite , a disagreement of more than @xmath13 . in addition ,",
    "adelberger and haxton @xcite fit the available data to obtain @xmath14 , a value somewhat larger than the @xmath2f upper limit .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath2f experiments is thought to be more reliable than for other nuclei @xcite . although experiments in other nuclei have been used to determine the weak meson - nucleon couplings ( see @xcite for reviews ) , their interpretation is considerably more model - dependent than @xmath2f since their interpretation involves _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of transition matrix elements of the meson - exchange potential .",
    "for this reason , they will not be considered here .",
    "recent progress has deepened the controversy .",
    "first we consider progress in the theory .",
    "kaplan and savage @xcite find that strangeness - changing currents , which were previously neglected , contribute substantially to @xmath1 .",
    "their result , @xmath15 , is in agreement with the desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) `` best '' value prediction .",
    "in contrast , henley , hwang , and kisslinger @xcite , using qcd sum rule techniques , find an almost complete cancellation between perturbative and non - perturbative contributions from weak neutral currents .",
    "this cancellation results in an extremely small @xmath16 , a factor of 24 smaller than kaplan and savage and ddh .    the interpretation of new data on the nuclear anapole moment of @xmath0cs has added a new dimension to the controversy .",
    "the non - zero measurement of the anapole moment of @xmath0cs @xcite has been analyzed by flambaum and murray @xcite to extract a value for @xmath1 .",
    "their result , @xmath17(expt)@xmath18(theor)@xmath19 is a factor of two larger than the ddh value and a factor of _ seven _ larger than the upper limit set by the @xmath2f experiments .",
    "we argue that the because of the sensitivity of the anapole moment to @xmath3 , the two experimental results are not incompatible .",
    "however , the constraint on the weak couplings extracted from the @xmath0cs result is inconsistent with that extracted from an earlier null measurement of the anapole moment of @xmath4tl @xcite , calling into question the reliability of the theoretical interpretation of the anapole moment .",
    "the issues raised by the apparent inconsistencies between different determinations of @xmath1 point out the need for a model - independent determination of the weak meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the determination of the weak - meson - nucleon couplings from experimental measurements in nuclei are discussed in the review by adelberger and haxton @xcite .",
    "there are substantial uncertainties in interpreting most experiments in nuclei because one can not make reliable _ ab initio _ calculations of amplitudes of the weak - meson - exchange potential operators .",
    "the experiment to measure the circular polarization @xmath20 of the 1081  kev transition in @xmath2f is an exception to this unfortunate situation because the matrix elements needed to extract a value for @xmath1 from experiments can be measured .",
    "the circular polarization of a @xmath7 parity - forbidden gamma transition in @xmath2f has been measured in five different and internally consistent experiments ( references given in @xcite ) . to a good approximation",
    "the circular polarization is due to the parity - violating mixing between the @xmath21 , @xmath22 parity - odd level ( @xmath23 ) in @xmath2f and the nearly degenerate @xmath21 , even - parity , @xmath24 level ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the circular polarization is given by : @xmath26 the magnitudes of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 transition amplitudes and the energy splitting @xmath29  kev between the levels are known experimentally .",
    "bennet , lowry , and krien @xcite and haxton @xcite point out that the unknown amplitude , @xmath30 , could be related to the lifetime of the first forbidden beta decay between isobaric analog of @xmath25 in @xmath2ne and @xmath23 . for beta transitions between opposite parity @xmath21 levels , spin and parity selection rules exclude all but two of the six possible transition amplitudes .",
    "one of these vanishes in the long wavelength limit leaving only the @xmath31 amplitude .",
    "haxton use pcac , current algebra , and the approximation that the neutron and proton densities are the same for the mass 18 system to argue that the two - body part of @xmath31 renormalizes the one body part and that the operator for the weak nucleon - nucleon potential due to pion exchange is to within a known constant an isospin rotation of the operator for @xmath31 .",
    "haxton evaluates the contributions of @xmath10 and @xmath32 to be a 5% correction to the pion term . since the experimental value , @xmath33 , of the asymmetry is consistent with zero , an upper limit for @xmath1 results .",
    "adelberger and haxton find @xmath12 .",
    "this value is a fraction of the ddh `` best '' value and is an order of magnitude smaller than the `` reasonable range '' .",
    "it should be noted , however , that kaplan and savage have suggested that including two - pion contributions may reduce the sensitivity of @xmath20 to @xmath1 through interference with the one - pion term @xcite .",
    "the anapole moment operator @xcite is a parity - odd rank one tensor and is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electromagnetic current density operator .",
    "the anapole moment has an expectation value of zero for states of definite parity .",
    "the size of the anapole moment is given by the dimensionless constant @xmath36 , whose value is thought to be theoretically stable for three reasons :    1 .",
    "the anapole moment of a nuclear state is a diagonal matrix element , in contrast to a transition matrix element .",
    "the nuclear wave function is constrained by the measured magnetic moment of the state .",
    "the single - particle estimate is @xmath37 for @xmath0cs and @xmath38 for @xmath4tl ( see , for example , @xcite ) in relatively good agreement with the experimental values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "3 .   the contribution to anapole moment of the spin of the odd proton can be estimated analytically and gives results close to those from full many - body calculations @xcite .",
    "the estimate of the one - body part of the anapole moment is similar to the calculation of the contribution of the spin of the unpaired nucleon to the magnetic moment of a nucleus .",
    "the analytical estimate @xcite gives a value in rough agreement with detailed nuclear structure calculations by haxton @xcite , haxton , henley , and musolf @xcite , flambaum and murray @xcite , and dmitriev and telitsin @xcite .",
    "the latter is the most recent calculation and includes the effects of spin , spin - orbit , convection , and contact currents , many - body corrections , and rpa re - normalization of the weak interaction addition to the single - particle weak interaction .",
    "an additional attractive feature of anapole moment measurements is that they can in principle be made for many nuclei , thus providing an opportunity to test the consistency of the theory .",
    "flambaum and murray have argued that the value of @xmath1 determined from the @xmath2f measurement and the measured value of the @xmath0cs anapole moment are inconsistent . as discussed in the introduction , they argue that the @xmath0cs result requires a much larger value of @xmath1 than the @xmath2f result .",
    "the @xmath0cs anapole moment is , however , almost as sensitive to @xmath41 as to @xmath1 , as we demonstrate below .",
    "because of this sensitivity , and because of the lack of model - independent constraints on @xmath3 , it possible to extract values of the two couplings which agree with both experiments .",
    "we follow the method of flambaum and murray in relating the @xmath0cs anapole moment to the weak couplings .",
    "dmitriev and telitsin @xcite calculate for the case of @xmath0cs @xmath42 here , flambaum and murray keep only the @xmath43 term .",
    "since this approximation leads to a reduced sensitivity of @xmath36 to @xmath3 , we keep all of the terms in equation  [ equ : gab ] . assuming only contributions from isovector @xmath8 and isoscalar @xmath10 exchange , the dimensionless constants @xmath44 can be related to the weak coupling constants @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for @xmath36 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath3 : @xmath49 equation  [ eq : kappa ] implies that it is possible to choose values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 which simultaneously satisfy both the @xmath2f and @xmath0cs measurements .",
    "this solution , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : wcc ] , consists of a small value for @xmath1 and a large value of @xmath3 , at the limit of the ddh `` reasonable range '' .",
    "in contrast , flambaum and murray assume the ddh `` best '' value of @xmath3 in their extraction of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0cs experiment is as yet the only non - zero measure of an anapole moment .",
    "there is , however , an earlier null measurement in @xmath4tl @xcite which is of sufficient accuracy to be relevant.pb @xcite , however the statistical accuracy of the measurements is not sufficient to usefully constrain the weak couplings . ]",
    "it is interesting to compare these two cases .",
    "dmitriev and telitsin treat both nuclei in a consistent way , so that we can use the two measurements as a check on the stability of the theory .",
    "we analyze the @xmath4tl result , @xmath50 , by the same method we used for @xmath0cs and find @xmath51 because they are both odd - proton nuclei , the anapole moments of the two show a similar dependence on the weak coupling constants .",
    "the experimental values @xmath50 for @xmath4tl @xcite and @xmath52 for @xmath0cs @xcite , however , lead to inconsistent constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath3 , as shown in figure  [ fig : wcc ] .",
    "the inconsistency is statistically significant , 2.5@xmath53 .",
    "this result suggests that nuclear structure effects which are not included in the theory may be important in interpreting the measurements , assuming both measurements are correct .",
    "the relationship between the values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 extracted from the @xmath2f and @xmath0cs experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : wcc ] . also indicated on the plot are the values we extract from the @xmath4tl experiment and the ddh `` best '' values and `` reasonable range '' .",
    "if one assumes , as do flambaum and murray , the ddh `` best '' value of @xmath3 value in interpreting the @xmath0cs result , there is indeed a statistically significant disagreement between the values of @xmath1 from the @xmath0cs anapole moment and from the @xmath2f measurements .",
    "no model - independent determination of @xmath3 , analogous to the method used for @xmath1 in @xmath2f , is possible from nuclear processes because the one - body part of the corresponding potential is @xmath9 .",
    "when the sensitivity of the anapole moment measurement to @xmath3 is considered , there is a solution consistent with both experiments , albeit an extreme one .",
    "this solution , taken at face value , is at the upper limit of the ddh `` reasonable range '' and implies that weak hadronic interaction phenomena in nuclei are determined primarily by one constant , @xmath3 .",
    "the apparent inconsistency between the @xmath0cs and @xmath4tl results , suggests that the nuclear theory of anapole moments is not yet reliable .",
    "the present controversy concerning the interpretation of measured nuclear anapole moments highlights the need to determine the weak couplings from experiments in few - nucleon systems whose interpretation is free from uncertainties in nuclear structure .",
    "if the weak meson - nucleon couplings were known , the present controversy could be more definitively addressed .",
    "one would then calculate the values of the anapole moments using the measured values of the couplings from few - nucleon experiments ; if the measured values of the anapole moments disagreed with these predictions , the problem would lie with the measurements , the nuclear theory , or the applicability of the meson - exchange model to nuclei .",
    "we now outline a technically feasible program of measurements to determine the most important weak meson - nucleon couplings ; @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath54 , and the combination @xmath55 .",
    "experiments which measured the longitudinal asymmetry @xmath56 in _ pp _ elastic scattering at 15 and 45  mev have considerably increased our knowledge of the weak meson - nucleon couplings @xcite .",
    "these experiments determine a linear combination of the @xmath9 , 1 , and 2 @xmath10 and the @xmath9 and 1 @xmath32 couplings .",
    "for example , at 45  mev , @xmath56 is given by @xcite @xmath57 an experiment in progress at triumf @xcite to measure @xmath56 at 221  mev is sensitive to only the @xmath10 couplings : @xmath58 further experiments are necessary to separate the relative contributions of the individual couplings , @xmath3 , @xmath41 , and @xmath54 . since the @xmath7 @xmath10 coupling is believed to be small @xcite , only one other independent measurement in necessary .",
    "measurements in the _ np _ system can provide the missing information .    the problem of separately determining the weak @xmath10 couplings could be resolved by measuring the circular polarization @xmath20 of the gammas emitted in the @xmath59 reaction .",
    "this observable is primarily sensitive to the @xmath9 and 2 @xmath10 couplings @xcite : @xmath60 the combination of this measurement and the triumf _ pp _ measurement would then independently determine @xmath3 and @xmath54 . in practice",
    ", it is experimentally easier to measure the inverse reaction , the directional asymmetry in the photo - disintegration of the deuteron by circularly polarized photons , due to the low efficiency of @xmath61-ray polarization analyzers . as in the case of @xmath62 ,",
    "existing measurements of @xmath20 ( or of the inverse reaction ) @xcite are not of sufficient precision to accomplish this task . with the availability of very intense gamma beams from compton back - scattering using free electron lasers @xcite , a more precise measurement of the deuteron photo - disintegration asymmetry is possible and should be pursued .",
    "the problem of determining @xmath1 can be addressed by measuring the gamma ray asymmetry with respect to neutron spin direction @xmath62 in the @xmath5 reaction . according to danilov s theorem @xcite , at thermal energies and below @xmath62",
    "is due entirely to weak processes that have @xmath7 .",
    "detailed calculations @xcite show that contributions from heavier mesons are suppressed and the process is dominated by @xmath8 exchange .",
    "@xmath62 is therefore almost completely determined by @xmath1 , with other couplings contributing at the few - percent level @xcite : @xmath63 unfortunately , existing measurements of @xmath62 @xcite are not of sufficient statistical precision necessary to determine @xmath1 .",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath62 would be a nuclear structure independent determination of @xmath1 , with the other couplings contributing only at the few - percent level .",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath62 should be pursued .",
    "finally , we point out that additional measurements in few - nucleon systems , for example neutron spin rotation in h@xmath64 or @xmath65he @xcite , would then test the applicability of the meson - exchange model to the weak interaction in nuclei , provided that the five - body calculations can be reliably performed .",
    "the recent measurement of the anapole moment of @xmath0cs appears to yield a value of @xmath1 which contradicts the upper limit from the earlier @xmath2f experiments .",
    "we argue that because of the sensitivity to @xmath3 in the @xmath0cs measurement , there is a combination of weak couplings which satisfies both experiments and which is ( barely ) in agreement with theory .",
    "in addition , the interpretation of the @xmath0cs result is inconsistent with an earlier null measurement in @xmath4tl , calling into question the reliability of the theory of nuclear anapole moments .",
    "all three experiments require assumptions about nuclear structure .",
    "we argue that measurements of directional asymmetry in @xmath59 and in the photo - disintegration of the deuteron by circularly polarized photons , combined with results from _ pp _ scattering , would determine the weak meson - nucleon couplings in a model - independent way ."
