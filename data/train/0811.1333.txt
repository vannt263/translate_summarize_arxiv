    "many cosmological observations , such as sne ia @xcite , wmap @xcite , sdss @xcite and x - ray @xcite , support that the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "these observations suggest that it is dominated by dark energy with negative pressure , which provides the dynamical mechanism for such an accelerating expansion .",
    "although the nature and origin of dark energy could perhaps understood by a fundamental underlying theory unknown up to now , physicists can still propose some paradigms to describe it . in this direction",
    "we can consider theories of modified gravity @xcite , or field models of dark energy .",
    "the field models that have been discussed widely in the literature consider a cosmological constant @xcite , a canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , a phantom field , that is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term @xcite , or the combination of quintessence and phantom in a unified model named quintom @xcite . finally , many theoretical studies are devoted to shed light on dark energy within the quantum gravitational framework , since , despite the lack of such a theory at present",
    ", we can still make some attempts to probe the nature of dark energy according to some of its basic principles . an interesting step in this direction is the so - called `` holographic dark energy '' proposal @xcite , which has been constructed in the light of holographic principle of quantum gravity @xcite , and thus it presents some interesting features of an underlying theory of dark energy .    in the present work we are interested in investigating the theoretical limits on the equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 of the phantom paradigm of dark energy , due to the basic requirements of quantum gravity . as we know",
    ", in field dark energy models , @xmath1 evolves according to the field evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , a basic and necessary constraint , consistent to our current knowledge of quantum field theory and ( quantum ) gravity , should be that the field variation during cosmological evolution should be less than the planck mass @xmath2 .",
    "such a constraint on field variation results in limits on @xmath1 . in the case of quintessence , this investigation has been performed in @xcite where the corresponding limits are presented . in this letter",
    "we study the phantom scenario .",
    "however , two points must be mentioned here .",
    "the first is that a well - established quantum theory of gravity could possibly induce stronger limits on @xmath1 .",
    "the requirement that the field variation must be smaller than @xmath2 is just the minimum condition , consistent with present theoretical knowledge .",
    "secondly , there is a discussion in the literature whether a construction of quantum field theory of phantoms is possible , namely whether the null energy condition is violated @xcite leading to causality and stability problems @xcite .",
    "however , more recently there have been serious attempts in overcoming these difficulties and construct a phantom theory consistent with the basic requirements of quantum field theory @xcite . in conclusion , although the discussion on the aforementioned two points is open , it is still interesting to examine the limits on @xmath1 due to the basic requirement of quantum gravity .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows : in section [ phanto ] we formulate the phantom cosmological scenario and we extract the relation between the field variation @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in section [ cosmimpl ]",
    "we investigate its behavior for various @xmath4-parametrizations and we examine the @xmath4 limits implied by the condition @xmath5 . finally , in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "we consider a general friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker universe with line element @xmath6 in comoving coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the scale factor and @xmath9 denotes the spacial curvature , with @xmath10 corresponding to a flat , closed or open universe respectively .",
    "the action of a universe constituted of a phantom field @xmath11 is @xcite : @xmath12 , \\label{actionquint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the term @xmath13 accounts for the matter content of the universe .",
    "the friedmann equations and the evolution equation for the phantom field are @xcite : @xmath14 , \\label{fr1}\\ ] ] @xmath15 , \\label{fr2}\\ ] ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter . in these expressions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the pressure and density of the phantom field , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding quantities for the matter content of the universe .",
    "finally , @xmath22 stands for the spatial curvature density : @xmath23    the energy density and pressure of the phantom field , are given by : @xmath24 @xmath25 as usual , the dark energy of the universe is attributed to the scalar field and it reads : @xmath26 \\label{oml}.\\ ] ] thus , the equation of state for the phantom dark energy is @xcite : @xmath27    the equations of motion close by considering the evolution of the matter density : @xmath28 finally , we remind that the phantom evolution equation ( [ phantom ] ) can be also written in the form of a conservation equation , namely : @xmath29    let us now calculate the phantom field variation in such a general phantom cosmological scenario . by definition",
    "it will be : @xmath30 where @xmath31 corresponds to the redshift of the beginning of the cosmological evolution ( chosen at will ) , @xmath32 is the corresponding time , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are their present values .",
    "the last equality arises from the fact that @xmath35 , according to the standard definition @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the present value .",
    "the time derivative of the phantom field can be easily calculated as follows . from the equation - of - state parameter definition ( [ eqstate ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath38 inserting this relation into ( [ enerphantom ] ) we acquire : @xmath39 where without loss of generality we have assumed that @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 .",
    "note that expression ( [ vss2 ] ) is always real , since in phantom scenario @xmath42 at all times .",
    "substituting relation ( [ vss2 ] ) into ( [ var1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath43\\ol(z')}\\,\\frac{d z'}{(1+z ' ) } \\label{var2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also used the friedmann equation ( [ fr1 ] ) and the definition ( [ oml ] ) .    in expression ( [ var2 ] ) , @xmath1 and @xmath44 are considered as functions of @xmath31 . to obtain @xmath45",
    "we first integrate ( [ sys4 ] ) , using also the @xmath1 definition : @xmath46.\\ ] ] in addition , according to ( [ curvdens ] ) we have @xmath47 , and as usual @xmath48 .",
    "thus , substituting these relations for the densities in the @xmath44 definition ( [ oml ] ) we finally acquire : @xmath49^{-1}=\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\nonumber\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the present values of the corresponding density parameters .",
    "therefore , substituting ( [ olz ] ) into ( [ var2 ] ) we acquire the desired phantom field variation @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the goal of this work is to investigate the limits on @xmath4 imposed by the basic requirements of quantum gravity . in general , in quantum field theory , in order to calculate the vacuum energy density one has to sum the zero - point energy of all normal modes of all the fields up to a uv cutoff , which is believed to be the planck mass @xmath2 .",
    "however , doing so we result with a vacuum energy tremendously higher than the observed value . in order to solve this famous ( cosmological constant ) problem we have to base upon a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "in @xcite it is suggested that gravity and the other quantum fields can not be treated independently in quantum gravity .",
    "for instance , in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime a new intrinsic uv cutoff @xmath53 arises for the u(1 ) gauge theory coupled to gravity with coupling @xmath54 , and this conjecture can be generalized to asymptotically de sitter spacetimes @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if there is a u(1 ) gauge theory with incredibly small coupling @xmath55 in our universe , it will result to a very small cosmological constant .",
    "a similar conjecture can be proposed in the case of the @xmath56 theory in minkowski and asymptotically de sitter spacetimes @xcite , i.e that the field value can not become larger than the planck scale @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in @xcite this assumption is generalized to every scalar field model , in order to avoid a breakdown of the theory due to the transition to over - planckian regimes , and this is also supported by string theoretical arguments @xcite . in conclusion , in this work we consider that a minimum and obvious requirement , consistent with the present knowledge of quantum gravity , is that the phantom field variation @xmath3 , throughout the entire cosmological evolution , must not exceed the planck mass @xmath2 , otherwise it would have left observable imprints .",
    "thus , using ( [ var2 ] ) , the condition @xmath5 reads : @xmath57\\ol(z')}\\,\\frac{d z'}{(1+z')}<1 \\label{var3},\\ ] ] with @xmath45 given by ( [ olz ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we extracted the minimum quantum gravitational restriction on phantom cosmology , namely relation ( [ var3 ] ) . our strategy is to use various parametrizations of @xmath4 ( since there is not a single , fundamental parametric form @xcite ) in order to extract the restrictions on their parameters according to ( [ var3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we will use the standard values @xmath58 and @xmath59 . concerning the curvature density @xmath52",
    ", we will assume it to be zero , as motivated by theoretical considerations , such as inflation , and observations .",
    "we will discuss the @xmath60 scenarios in the end of this section .",
    "let us now investigate the various @xmath4 cases of the literature .",
    "+    case i : @xmath61const    we start our study by the simplest model , that is a constant @xmath42 . as an `` initial '' @xmath31 for the cosmological evolution we will consider the last scattering , that is @xmath62 , however our quantitative results are almost independent of @xmath31 for @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ casei ] we depict @xmath64 according to ( [ var3 ] ) , for @xmath61const .",
    "surprisingly enough , we observe that for every value of the parameter @xmath65 , the ratio @xmath64 is always less than one .",
    "thus , the minimum quantum gravitational restriction does not imply any limit on @xmath65 in phantom cosmology .",
    "this is in radical contrast with the corresponding result for quintessence paradigm , where for this simple @xmath4-parametrization the author finds @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "let us consider the case where the equation - of - state parameter is a linear function of the redshift @xcite .",
    "this proves to be a good parametrization at low redshift , in agreement with observations .",
    "however , @xmath4 obviously diverges at large @xmath31 , making it unsuitable at high redshift .",
    "as we know , the redshift of the supernova legacy survey is less than 2 @xcite , and thus we will use this value as an `` initial '' redshift of the phantom cosmological evolution . in fig .",
    "[ caseii ] we depict @xmath64 according to ( [ var3 ] ) , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "as we observe , @xmath64 is always less than one , independently of the values of the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",
    "this result holds even if we consider another term in the parametrization , namely @xmath70 ( following @xcite ) , and even if we consider another value for the `` initial '' @xmath31 ( we mention that our quantitative results are independent of @xmath31 for @xmath71 ) . thus , the condition @xmath5 does not imply any limit on the parameters of this @xmath4-parametrization in phantom cosmology .",
    "again , this is in contrast with the corresponding result for quintessence paradigm , where it can be shown that @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite . to present this qualitative difference in a more transparent way , we repeat our investigation for this @xmath4-parametrization , but for a canonical @xmath74 instead of a phantom field , i.e for the case of quintessence . in this case",
    "we result to a relation similar to ( [ var3 ] ) , but without the minus sign in the square root . in fig .",
    "[ caseiiq ] we depict @xmath75 for @xmath67 in the case of quintessence cosmology .",
    "clearly , the constraint @xmath76 leads to the aforementioned limits on @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath77    this parametrization is suggested in @xcite .",
    "it overcomes the divergence problem of case ii above and has been widely used in the literature . in fig .",
    "[ caseiii ] we depict @xmath64 according to ( [ var3 ] ) , for @xmath77 and @xmath62 .    similarly to the previous cases , we see that @xmath64 is always less than one , independently of the values of the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",
    "this holds even if we consider another term in the parametrization , namely @xmath78 , following @xcite . finally , these results hold even if we consider another value for the `` initial '' @xmath31 ( we mention that in this case our quantitative results are independent of @xmath31 for @xmath79 )",
    ". therefore , the condition @xmath5 does not imply any limit on the parameters of this @xmath4-parametrization in phantom cosmology .",
    "this is also in contrast with the corresponding quintessence case , where we obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "@xmath82    this parametrization is suggested in @xcite . at low redshift",
    "it is very efficient in describing observations , but at high redshift it diverges , although more slowly than case ii above .",
    "thus , as an `` initial '' redshift we will consider @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ caseiv ] we present @xmath64 according to ( [ var3 ] ) , for @xmath82 .",
    "we observe that @xmath64 is always less than one , independently of the values of the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",
    "this result holds even if we consider a third term in the parametrization , namely @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] ( as suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these results hold even if we consider another value for the `` initial '' @xmath31 , since quantitatively our results are independent of @xmath31 for @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath5 does not imply any limit on the parameters of this @xmath4-parametrization in phantom scenario .",
    "this is in contrast with the corresponding quintessence case , which we present in fig .",
    "[ caseivq ] since this case has not been studied in the literature .    in this scenario",
    "we get @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the qualitative difference between phantom and quintessence behavior is obvious .",
    "+    case v. phantom models with nearly flat potentials    in @xcite the authors examine phantom models with nearly flat potentials . under this assumption",
    "they result in a single expression for @xmath0 , depending only on the initial field values and their derivatives .",
    "in particular , they obtain the following @xmath4-parametrization : with the single parameter @xmath87 satisfying @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "[ casev ] we present @xmath64 for this case , and since @xmath4 does not diverge for high @xmath31 we use @xmath62 ( note that our quantitative results do not depend on @xmath31 for @xmath89 ) .    as we can see @xmath64 is always less than one , independently of the value of the parameter @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath5 does not imply any limit on the parameters of this @xmath4-parametrization in phantom scenario .    in the investigation of this section , up to now",
    ", we have considered @xmath90 , that is a flat universe .",
    "let us now examine the @xmath60 case .",
    "repeating the same steps we find that the requirement @xmath5 is satisfied without implying any restrictions on @xmath4 , as long as @xmath91 .",
    "although the value of @xmath52 can not be determined exactly by observations , it is highly unlikely to exceed this range .",
    "thus , our results are valid also in the non - flat scenarios , providing @xmath52 takes realistic values .",
    "in this work we investigate the possible limitations on the phantom equation - of - state parameter @xmath4 , due to quantum gravitational effects .",
    "since quantum gravity is still a matter of research , we have to rely on the basic and minimum requirement of our current knowledge on the field , namely that the field variation during the entire cosmological evolution must not exceed the planck scale , otherwise it would have left observable imprints .",
    "although a well - established quantum theory of gravity could possibly induce stronger limits on @xmath1 , it is still interesting to investigate the aforementioned condition .",
    "finally , note that a restriction based on the field values is more general and more fundamental than one based on the potential ( for example @xmath92 as considered in in @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , we find that for various @xmath4-parametrizations , the condition @xmath5 in phantom cosmology does not imply any limitations on @xmath4 at all .",
    "this is in radical contrast with the quintessence case , where even this minimum requirement results in strong limitations on @xmath4 , even more stringent than the present experiments @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this difference is the sign change in some of the corresponding expressions of the two cosmological scenarios , as well as the fact that @xmath93 in phantom while @xmath94 in quintessence models .",
    "these features lead the phantom quantities to behave more smoothly , comparing to the quintessence ones , and thus the simple quantum gravitational condition is not violated .    in our investigation",
    "the phantom potential can be arbitrary , and thus our results are general and hold for every phantom cosmological scenario .",
    "furthermore , they are valid in the non - flat universe , too . in conclusion",
    ", we see that the phantom paradigm , and its induced dark energy equation - of - state parameter , is not at all restricted by the basic quantum gravitational requirement .",
    "this feature makes phantom cosmology more robust and capable of composing the underlying mechanism for dark energy . +            c. l. bennett",

    "<S> this is in radical contrast with the quintessence paradigm , and makes phantom cosmology more robust and capable of constituting the underlying mechanism for dark energy . </S>"
