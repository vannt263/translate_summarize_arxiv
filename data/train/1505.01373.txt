    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite has inspired the development of a wide range of dark energy ( de ) and modified gravity models .",
    "the simplest de candidate , the cosmological constant @xmath1 , is a parameter in general relativity and is consistent with all current observations @xcite .",
    "the main problem with @xmath1 is not why it has a particular value , but the fact that the vacuum energy contribution to @xmath1 is sensitive to the ultraviolet cutoff scale and requires a technically unnatural fine - tuning @xcite , which is the long - standing cosmological constant problem ( ccp ) @xcite .",
    "most of the dynamical de and modified gravity models proposed in the literature do not offer a solution to this old problem .",
    "the ccp would be surmountable if there was a dynamical mechanism by which vacuum energy could decay from its initially large value and settle at an attractor consistent with the observed value of @xmath1 .",
    "while a full theory of the quantum vacuum that would contain such a mechanism does not exist , this idea has motivated phenomenological models of decaying vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "one way to have a nonconstant vacuum energy is to introduce a new dynamical degree of freedom , , a scalar field .",
    "an alternative approach , which avoids explicitly introducing new degrees of freedom while still preserving the general covariance of the evolution of cosmological perturbations , is to allow for the exchange of momentum between the vacuum energy and other species @xcite .",
    "both the minimally @xcite and nonminimally @xcite coupled quintessence models can be cast in this general framework . in the former case ,",
    "the vacuum ( the potential energy ) exchanges energy with the kinetic energy of the scalar field . in the latter , there is an additional exchange with matter . in this sense , one can say that a time - dependent vacuum energy is necessarily interacting . since additional interactions in the visible matter sector are strongly constrained while the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is largely unknown , we will consider models in which the vacuum interacts only with dm .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the phenomenological model of vacuum energy evolution introduced in @xcite which avoids dealing with explicit additional degrees of freedom .",
    "the vacuum equation of state is by definition equal to @xmath2 , but the vacuum energy density @xmath3 is allowed to vary because of the interaction with dm , @xmath4 .",
    "in the interacting vacuum energy model the background dm and vacuum energy densities obey continuity equations [ rhodmdot ] _ dm+3h_dm = -q ;   = q , [ vdot ] where @xmath5 denotes the energy transfer between dm and vacuum energy .",
    "an arbitrary energy transfer @xmath5 can in principle reproduce an arbitrary background cosmology , with energy density @xmath6 and pressure @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this reduces to @xmath1cdm when @xmath8 .    to calculate the linear perturbations",
    ", we need to specify a covariant form of the energy - momentum transfer 4-vector .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the covariant interaction is parallel to the 4-velocity of dm , @xmath9 .",
    "there are other choices @xcite , but this covariant form for the interaction means that there is no momentum transfer in the dm comoving - orthogonal frame and hence the dm particles follow geodesics , as in @xmath1cdm .",
    "although the interacting vacuum does allow inhomogeneous perturbations , one can always choose a frame in which the vacuum is spatially homogeneous , @xmath10 . for geodesic",
    "dm this coincides with comoving - orthogonal frame @xcite and the perturbation equations are particularly simple in this gauge .",
    "note that in this case the energy transfer is a potential flow , @xmath11 , and therefore the matter velocity @xmath12 must be irrotational @xcite .",
    "the dm density contrast evolves according to @xmath13 where the divergence of the matter 3-velocity is given by the extrinsic curvature of the metric , @xmath14 in the comoving - synchronous gauge , and @xmath15 is the scalar mode of metric perturbations @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath5 to be of a form inspired by the generalized chaplygin gas model @xcite , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a dimensionless coupling parameter @xcite .",
    "this form naturally reproduces a conventional matter - dominated solution at early times , and a vacuum dominated solution at late times , while allowing more general evolution in between .",
    "previous studies @xcite have constrained the interaction assuming @xmath18 , in four redshift intervals . ]    in this paper , we make no assumptions about the time dependence of @xmath17 and directly reconstruct it from data using the nonparametric bayesian approach introduced in @xcite .",
    "we are thus able to describe a general background cosmology and reproduce any equation of state seen in quintessence models , but the perturbations are of a restricted form with vanishing sound speed but nonzero energy transfer to or from dm , determined by the background cosmology .",
    "thus our model is degenerate with quintessence models in terms of the background cosmology , but distinguished by the evolution of perturbations .",
    "we first discretize @xmath0 into bins @xmath19 , @xmath20 , distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath21 $ ] , giving us @xmath22 parameters @xmath23 that can be fit to data .",
    "any representation of a function with a finite number of parameters is necessarily inaccurate and , in the absence of additional priors , the outcome of the fit would directly depend on @xmath22 . as shown by crittenden @xcite , it is possible to eliminate the dependence on @xmath22 and explicitly control the reconstruction bias by adding a prior that correlates the nearby bins .    in the correlated prior approach",
    "one assumes that @xmath0 is a smooth function , so that its values at neighboring points in @xmath24 are not entirely independent .",
    "more specifically , @xmath0 is taken to be a gaussian random variable with a given correlation @xmath25 between its values at @xmath24 and @xmath26 , @xmath27[\\alpha(a ' ) - \\alpha^{\\rm fid}(a ' ) ] \\right\\rangle$ ] , which is nonzero for @xmath28 below a given `` correlation length '' but vanishes at much larger separations , and @xmath29 is a reference fiducial model . given a particular functional form of @xmath30 , one can calculate the corresponding covariance matrix for the @xmath22 parameters @xmath23 : [ eq : cij ] c_ij=_a_i^a_i+a _ a_j^a_j+a  ( |a - a| ) , where @xmath31 is the bin width .",
    "this covariance matrix defines a ( gaussian ) prior probability distribution for parameters @xmath23 and its product with the likelihood , according to bayes theorem , gives the desired posterior distribution .",
    "thus , the reconstruction amounts to finding the minimum of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is some fiducial model . to avoid dependence on @xmath34",
    ", we take it to be constant and marginalize over its value following @xcite .",
    "we adopt the cpz form @xcite for the correlation function , @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 determines the correlation length and @xmath37 sets the strength of the prior .",
    "this form has the advantage of making it possible to evaluate integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cij ] ) analytically , while also having a transparent dependence on its two parameters .",
    "we also note that , as shown in @xcite , the outcome of reconstruction is largely insensitive to the particular function chosen to represent @xmath38 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath36 sets the effective number of degrees of freedom allowed by the prior : @xmath39 .",
    "as long as @xmath40 , the reconstructed result is independent of @xmath22 . rather than adjusting @xmath37 to control the strength of the prior",
    ", we use the variance of the mean given by @xmath41 in the limit @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "namely , given @xmath36 , one can adjust @xmath37 to keep the prior on the uncertainty in the mean of @xmath0 independent of @xmath43 . in",
    "what follows , we take @xmath44 based on the constraint on a constant @xmath17 obtained in @xcite , and set @xmath45 . as we show later using principal component analysis ( pca ) , this choice of @xmath36 effectively separates the signal from noise , thus allowing a high - resolution reconstruction with minimal contamination from the noise .",
    "our data sets include the cmb temperature and polarization power spectra from planck @xcite and wmap9 @xcite respectively ; the jla supernovae sample @xcite ; the bao measurements of 6dfgrs @xcite , sdss dr7 @xcite , boss lowz @xcite and boss lyman-@xmath17 forest ( lyaf ) @xcite ; the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) measurements which probe both the expansion and the growth history , namely ( @xmath46 ) from boss cmass @xcite and ( @xmath47 ) from wigglez @xcite , where @xmath48 quantifies the  alcock - paczynski \" effect @xcite .",
    "we denote these data sets as  rsd ( with ap effect ) , \" while we also use a  rsd ( all ) \" data set that includes additional rsd measurements without the ap effect : 6dfgrs @xcite , 2dfgrs @xcite , sdss lrg @xcite and vipers @xcite .",
    "we present the constraints from four data combinations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "the rsd measurements constrain @xmath49 , the product of the growth rate and the variance of the total matter density contrast .",
    "note that the continuity equation of dm density contrast in our model [ eq .",
    "( [ dmenergy ] ) ] is different from that in @xmath1cdm and , therefore , the growth rate probed by the rsd is no longer simply that of the dm component .",
    "namely , in @xmath1cdm , the velocity divergence of dm , @xmath50 , is simply @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dm growth rate . in the interacting vacuum model , eq .",
    "( [ dmenergy ] ) implies that = -h _ -f_i h _ -f_h_m .",
    "if @xmath53 , the effective dm growth rate @xmath54 , the appropriately weighted total matter growth rate @xmath55 @xcite and @xmath56 are different from each other . it can be shown that [ eq : fvartheta ] f_= ( + ) ^-1 , where @xmath57 is the growth rate of baryons . in the absence of an interaction we recover the standard result : @xmath58 , while , in general , it is @xmath59 that is measured by rsd .",
    "we discretize @xmath0 into @xmath60 bins uniform in @xmath24 within [ 0.001 , 1 ] , and use monte carlo markov chains ( mcmc ) implemented in a modified version of cosmomc @xcite to fit them to data along with all other relevant cosmological parameters .",
    "a total @xmath61 is minimized and the joint posterior probability distribution for all the parameters is obtained after the mcmc has converged .        the best - fit reconstructed models of @xmath0 ( with 68% and 95% c.l .",
    "errors ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "the @xmath1cdm fits the observations well when the lyaf bao measurements are not included ( data i ) and the reconstruction remains almost unchanged after adding more rsd data ( data ii ) .",
    "however , when the lyaf data is included , we see evidence for an evolving @xmath17 : data iii ( iv ) shows a @xmath62 improvement in the fit for the @xmath63 model . in these cases ,",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 model changes sign during its evolution , , it is positive at @xmath64 , implying an energy transfer from dm to vacuum energy , but negative at @xmath65 , implying vacuum decay . at @xmath66 ,",
    "@xmath17 is consistent with @xmath1cdm .",
    "the variations at higher and lower redshifts compensate to make the deceleration - acceleration transition redshift , @xmath67 from data iii , close to the @xmath1cdm value of @xmath68 , which agrees with the value extracted from the @xmath69 data @xcite using a gaussian prior of @xmath70 , but is smaller than the value extracted using a prior of @xmath71 @xcite . again , adding more rsd data points ( data iv versus data iii ) does not change the reconstruction significantly .    to understand this result , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bao - fs8-pca ] we show the theoretical predictions for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the best - fit binned model from data iii rescaled by the corresponding best - fit @xmath1cdm model predictions , together with the actual measurements . in panel",
    "( a ) , the lyaf measurement ( open star ) , has the smallest error bar and pulls the fit down , also making it more consistent with the cmass measurement ( filled star ) .",
    "this reduces the bao @xmath61 by @xmath74 .",
    "this fit is favored by the @xmath73 as well ( panel b ) , further reducing the @xmath61 by @xmath75 .",
    "the remaining data from cmb and sn slightly disfavor this model ; namely , they increase @xmath61 by @xmath76 , but not enough to compensate for the reduction in @xmath61 from bao and rsd .",
    "the improvement in the fit achieved by the binned model must be weighed against the increased number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be quantified via the bayes factor , or the ratio of the bayesian evidences of the interacting model and the @xmath1cdm model . for one model",
    "to be preferred over the other , the bayes factor should be significantly greater than 1 .",
    "since the evidence depends on the prior assumed for the binned coupling @xmath77 , we follow the method in @xcite to examine the dependence of the bayes factor on the the variance in each bin , @xmath78 , which controls the strength of the prior . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bayes - evi ] , we plot the logarithm of the evidence ratio ( @xmath79 ) as well as the logarithms of the ratios of the volumes of parameter space ( @xmath80 ) and the likelihood ( @xmath81 ) as a function of @xmath78 . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the prior effectively forces @xmath77 to become equal to the fiducial model , which is @xmath1cdm , and all three ratios approach unity .",
    "increasing @xmath78 allows for more freedom in the variation of @xmath77 and improves the fit .",
    "however , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : bayes - evi ] , the improvement in the fit is not sufficient to compensate for the increase in the parameter volume .",
    "the bayes factor is only marginally greater than 1 for a limited range of @xmath78 around the value of @xmath83 , which was the value used in the reconstruction in fig .",

    "thus , we conclude that the interacting model is not preferred over @xmath1cdm .    ) , of likelihoods ( @xmath81 ) , and of the evidences ( @xmath79 ) for the binned model and the @xmath1cdm as a function of the strength of the prior set by the variance in each bin , @xmath78 . ]    even with the lack of strong preference for the evolving model , it is still interesting to know to what extent our reconstruction constrains the evolution of the vacuum energy .",
    "for instance , one could ask which part of the information is informed by data and which part is informed by the prior .",
    "the errors shown in the reconstruction in fig .  [ fig : alpha ] are highly correlated , making their direct interpretation difficult . principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "is a useful tool that can be used to analyze and tune the prior ( for applications of pca to de studies , see , @xcite ) .",
    "the pca seeks the orthonormal eigenmodes of the inverse covariance matrix @xmath84 of the @xmath17 bins after marginalizing over other cosmological parameters .",
    "namely , @xmath85 , with eigenvectors defined by the decomposition matrix @xmath86 and the eigenvalues given by the elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath1 .",
    "eigenmodes define independent linear combinations of the original parameters ( @xmath17 bins ) that have uncorrelated errors and , thus , are easier to interpret .",
    "we can also use pca to compare the eigenmodes with and without the prior which , as we explain below , allows us to estimate the effective number of degrees of freedom of @xmath0 constrained by data . performing the pca is straightforward , since @xmath84 is one of the products of our mcmc calculation .",
    "the eigenvalues of both the prior and the data+prior covariance are shown in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : bao - fs8-pca ] .",
    "there are three data eigenmodes that are not affected by the prior , , these three best constrained modes pass the prior with almost no penalty .",
    "the shapes of these modes are shown in panel ( d)and we find that they are similar for all data combinations . the remaining modes , on the other hand , are dominated by the prior .",
    "thus , even though our model has many bins of @xmath17 as parameters , there are effectively only three additional degrees of freedom .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we find that the total @xmath61 is reduced by @xmath87 , which is somewhat greater than expected for a model with three additional parameters .    the eigenvectors provide a natural basis onto which an arbitrary @xmath0 can be expanded , , @xmath88 .",
    "given any @xmath0 , the coefficients @xmath89 can then be found using the orthogonality of the modes .",
    "the @xmath89 s corresponding to the three best constrained eigenmodes of the best - fit models from the four data combinations are listed in table [ tab : coeff ] . since",
    "the uncertainty in the third eigenmode is large , adding more modes by relaxing the prior [ either by reducing @xmath37 or @xmath36 ] would not notably change the fit .",
    ".the coefficients ( best - fit and 68% c.l .",
    "uncertainty ) of the first three best - determined modes , @xmath91 , of the best - fit models using different data combinations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we performed a high - resolution reconstruction of @xmath17 , the coupling between dm and vacuum energy , as a function of the scale factor using the latest observations including cmb , sn , bao and rsd .",
    "our model is degenerate with standard quintessence models in terms of the background cosmology , but is distinguished by the growth of perturbations .",
    "we found that , when the bao measurement using the boss lyaf sample @xcite is used , an evolving @xmath17 is mildly favored by the joint data set .",
    "interestingly , the best - fit @xmath0 model changes sign during its evolution : @xmath92 at higher redshifts , implying an energy transfer from dm to vacuum energy , while @xmath93 at lower redshifts , corresponding to a decaying vacuum energy .",
    "a pca study of our result shows that we have extracted three informative eigenmodes from the data .    the lyaf bao measurement , which is the best existing bao measurement at such a high redshift , is in tension with the @xmath1cdm model at the @xmath94 level .",
    "as noted in @xcite , it can be interpreted as favoring a de component with a negative energy density at @xmath95 .",
    "the rsd measurements from boss and wigglez are also in tension with @xmath1cdm : the rsd measurements favor a lower growth rate than the @xmath1cdm prediction at low redshifts .",
    "the interacting vacuum model provides another physical interpretation of these tensions if @xmath17 is allowed to change sign during its evolution .",
    "we note that extracting bao from lyaf data is a relatively new field , and the current measurement could be subject to systematic issues @xcite .",
