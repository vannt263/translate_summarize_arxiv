    "we consider a cellular mobile network in which each base station ( bs ) is equipped with a large - scale antenna array whose size @xmath0 is much greater than the number of single - antenna mobile users it serves .",
    "such a large - scale ( distributed ) multiple - input , multiple - output ( mimo ) system or a massive mimo system for short has the potentiality of achieving transmission rate much higher than those offered by current cellular systems with enhanced reliability and drastically improved power efficiency .",
    "it takes advantage of the so - called channel - hardening effect @xcite which implies that the channel vectors seen by different users tend to be mutually orthogonal and frequency - independent @xcite . as a result ,",
    "linear receivers are near - optimal in the uplink and simple multiuser ( mu ) precoders are sufficient to guarantee satisfactory downlink performance .",
    "we consider a single cell within such a network whose bs array size @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the number of single antenna mobile users within its coverage range , and refer to this system as a distributed massive mimo system .    to estimate a massive mimo channel",
    ", we can employ the conventional pilot - assisted channel estimators ( ces ) such as least - squares ( ls ) @xcite or minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimators @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the massive mimo channels spatial sparseness , ces based on compressive sensing ( cs ) have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of cs recovery is high and cs - based methods often call for the use of randomized pilots to produce a sensing matrix which satisfies the restricted isometry property ( rip ) .",
    "they also assume that the channel has limited paths with separable angles of arrivals ( aoas ) .",
    "in fact , there are not many articles consider mimo channels with a cluster of stochastic aoas around a mean angle .",
    "to circumvent such a limitation , a complicated bayesian learning approach with a gaussian - mixture channel model , was developed in @xcite .",
    "assuming the channel can be represented by a nonnegative combination of limited number of elements from the so - called atomic set , @xcite presented a denoising - based ce .    by exploiting the transform domain sparseness , @xcite presented transform domain ces that use only significant components in the transform domain to reduce the noise effect and computing complexity .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite explored various transforms , @xcite and the references therein focused on the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) domain . in this paper , we extend and analyze the performance of the transform - domain approach that exploits the spatial correlation - induced channel rank reduction .",
    "we show that with a judicial choice of the unitary transform and a proper selection of the dominant subspace , the resulting ce gives excellent performance as it involves only the critical channel dimensions which is much smaller than that required by the conventional methods @xcite .",
    "in other words , the efficiency of a transform - domain ce depends not only on the unitary basis ( transform ) used but on how one selects a proper subset of the basis vectors which span the dominant channel subspace .",
    "furthermore , we verify that improved performance is attainable if an additional angle alignment operation is in place so that the receive array points to the mean aoa .",
    "we discuss the effect of the basis ( transform ) used has on the ce s mse performance and explain the near - optimality of the type-2 discrete cosine transform ( dct-2 ) basis .",
    "our analysis enables us to find the relations between some channel parameters such as channel rank , array size , signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and the mse performance for a given basis .",
    "it also leads to a robust rank determination algorithm .",
    "the proposed ce , as will be seen , can provide additional information about the mean aoa as well .",

    "<S> further mse analysis reveals the relations among the array size , channel rank , signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and the estimators performance . </S>",
    "<S> it provides rationales for the proposed rank determination and mean aoa estimation algorithms as well .    an angle alignment operation included in one of our channel models is proved to be effective in further reducing the required rank , shifting the dominant basis vectors range ( channel spectrum ) and improving the estimator s performance when a suitable basis is used . </S>",
    "<S> we also draw insightful analogies among mimo channel modeling , transform coding , parallel spatial search , and receive beamforming . </S>",
    "<S> computer experiment results are provided to examine the numerical effects of various estimator parameters and the advantages of the proposed channel estimators and rank determination method .    </S>",
