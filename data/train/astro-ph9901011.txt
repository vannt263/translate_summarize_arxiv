    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emit large amounts of energy ( @xmath13 ergs s@xmath3 , from seyfert galaxies to qsos ) over a large range of the spectrum coming from a small volume .",
    "the nature of the central engine that produces these extraordinary amounts of energy remains virtually unknown .",
    "current agn theories include : i ) black holes ( bhs ) accreting matter from the surroundings ( e.g. rees 1984 ) ; ii ) starburst ( sb ) models in which activity is due to star formation in a central cluster ( e.g. terlevich et al .",
    "1992 - who have revived old theories , e.g. , of shklovskii 1960 , field 1964 ) ; and iii ) bhs surrounded by dense starbursts ( e.g. perry & dyson 1985 , scoville & norman 1988 , williams & perry 1994 ) .",
    "while bh models ( with masses @xmath14 ) accreting matter from the surroundings have the power to produce the observed luminosities and naturally provide a preferred axis for collimating jets , they seem to explain unsatisfactorily , e.g. , the broad emission - line regions ( belrs ) of agn ( as they require a fine - tuning to fit the observations ) . in starburst models , on the other hand , strongly radiative compact supernova remnants ( csnrs ) are the source of the broad emission lines .",
    "this model has been proved plausible in explaining the observed emission line spectrum , the uv - optical continuum and related variability ( e.g. , terlevich et al . 1992 ) , but is difficult to be applied to the whole population of agn . in particular",
    ", they do not provide a natural mechanism for jet production and collimation .",
    "we here address this question .",
    "it seems plausible that active star formation and a compact agn activity may coexist in the nucleus of luminous infrared galaxies ( the so called ligs which are characterized by extreme mid- to far - ir luminosities @xmath15 and high brightness temperature radio emission ) .",
    "the question to assess the relative contribution of each form of activity to the ligs energetics , and to determine a potential evolutionary progression from one to the other has been recently addressed by smith , lonsdale & lonsdale ( 1998 , hereafter sll98 ) . searching for a sb - compact object agn connection in these luminous infrared galaxies they have demonstrated that nuclear starbursts can in principle explain the observed vlbi- and vla- scale structures and the high infrared luminosities of most of these objects , although in some cases severe constraints must be imposed on the initial mass function and , in general , complexes of extremely luminous radio supernovae ( rsns ) ( clustered in pc - scale clumps ) are required to explain the high-@xmath16 observed . in a sample of 10 ligs , they found potentially 6 sb systems , 3 possible hybrid / intermediate systems and 1 quasar - like object ( or bh candidate ) .",
    "this would favor an evolutionary interpretation in which a sb eventually begins to fuel a coalescing central compact object .",
    "galactic mergers are believed to be responsible for the origin of ligs , and numerical simulations ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) suggest that the sb occurs relatively late in the merging process ( @xmath10 @xmath17 yr ) .",
    "sll98 results , in turn , suggest that a sb phase might carry on for another @xmath18 yr as the nuclei coalesce and a compact agn develops .",
    "once the compact agn fully turns on , it must quickly consume its shroud of dust thus extinguishing the star formation process .",
    "a prototype of the lig class , arp 220 , seems to be dominated by a massive nuclear starburst imbedded in a rotating disk - like structure of dense molecular gas with a radius @xmath19 pc , and with densities ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) and temperatures similar to those of the gmc core regions in our galaxy ( scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 , hereafter syb97 ) .",
    "several other systems ( e.g. , ngc 6240 and mrk231 ) bear striking similarities to arp 220 , which are suggestive of a centrifugally supported disk of dense molecular gas .",
    "these disks may play a critical role in the evolution of ultra - luminous galactic nuclei and in their energy release .",
    "the high density of the gas will undoubtedly promote extremely high rates of massive star formation since the conditions are very similar to those of gmc cores . in these cases ,",
    "the presence of strong , highly ordered magnetic fields could provide both the conditions appropriate for rsn formation and production of collimated outflows .",
    "nuclear outflows have been observed in several seyfert galaxies and ligs ( e.g. , arp 220 , ngc 6240 , ngc 2782 , ngc 4945 , and ngc 4235 ) ( see , e.g. , heckman , lehrnet , & armus 1993 , colbert et al .",
    "1996 , jogee et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) . in the case of the ligs , the detection of emission line profiles with typical line widths of 200 - 600 km s@xmath3 , and in some cases with fwhm as large as 1000 km s@xmath3 ( e.g. ngc 6240 ) , are signatures of the presence of high - speed , supersonic outflows where the lines are produced by shock - heated ambient gas which is swept by the outflow ( heckman , armus , @xmath22 miley 1990 , herareafter ham90 ) . in the case of the seyfert galaxies , radio observations of a distance - limited sample of edge - on galaxies by colbert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , have shown that 6 of the 10 observed galaxies , have extended radio structures with radial extent between 5 and 30 kpc .",
    "they are oriented at skewed angles ( @xmath23 ) with respect to the galaxy minor axis and do not look like the wide - angled winds observed in typical starburst galaxies .",
    "their morphologies resemble instead , those of more collimated outflows originating in the nuclear region ( within 1 kpc ) , like the jets observed in extended radio galaxies , although the seyfert outflows are weaker ( with radio power at 4.9 ghz , @xmath24 w hz@xmath25 ) , smaller , and less collimated than those of the radio galaxies ( which have typical radio power at 1.4 ghz , @xmath26 w hz@xmath3 ) .",
    "terminal outflow velocities of @xmath27 25 to 150 km s@xmath3 and magnetic fields @xmath28 to @xmath29 g at 5 to 30 kpc scales ( implying average fields @xmath30 g at @xmath27 1 kpc ) have been inferred from the observations .",
    "based on the evidences above , it seems plausible that the ligs and perhaps some of the low - level - activity agn class of seyfert galaxies may be powered by nuclear sbs at least during part of their active lives . in the present work , we assume that a sb , which has been induced in an interaction or merging process , is in progress in the nuclear region of these objects and examine the conditions under which collimated outflows can be produced in such a scenario .",
    "previous purely hydrodynamic numerical studies of starbursts generated within few kpc radius from the nucleus have shown that sb mass loss dynamics may provide favorable conditions for a free vertically directed escape of hot gas from the galactic environment at the vigorous sn dominated phase of the sb ( e.g. , tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 , de young & gallagher 1990 , suchkov et al .",
    "1994 , tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun 1997 ) .",
    "those models have successfully explained the formation of the poor - collimated , wide - angled super - winds ( with radius @xmath10 1 kpc ) often observed in sb galaxies ( e.g. , ham90 ) . in this work , however , we are mainly interested in systems with potential sb - agn activity connection and thus examine the production of outflows within radial distances of few tens of parsecs from the central core .",
    "we consider a mechanism that can provide efficient collimation and acceleration of the emerging outflow on these scales .",
    "we assume that part of the gas released by star formation in the rotating sb system is quickly collected into a disk with similar conditions , for example , to those observed in the arp 220 nuclear disk .",
    "observations support the evidence for magnetized outflows .",
    "since magnetic winds can be produced by rotating objects with a magnetic field anchored into them ( e.g. , weber and davis 1967 ) , we assume that magnetic fields are present due to magnetic - flux captured from the environment during the formation of the disk , and compression by the accretion process ( see , e.g. , spruit 1996 ) .    the perception that rapid rotation coupled with strong magnetic fields could drive outflows",
    "was first realized in the context of the solar wind theory ( e.g. , weber and davis 1967 , mestel 1968 ) .",
    "later , blandford @xmath22 payne ( 1982 ) introduced a scale free hydromagnetic wind model for jet acceleration from a magnetized disk which gives centrifugally driven outflow solutions .",
    "these solutions also have the possibility of being self - collimated ( heyvaerts @xmath22 norman 1989 ) .",
    "( see , however , okamoto 1998 for a discussion on the limitations of these models . )",
    "similar outflow models were subsequently applied to proto - stellar objects ( e.g. , pudritz & norman 1983 , pelletier & pudritz 1992 , wardle & knigl 1993 , shu et al .",
    "1994 , see also spruit 1996 , for a review ) , galactic x - ray binaries ( e.g. , blandford 1993 ) , and proto - jovian planets ( quillen & trillen 1998 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we use the pelletier and pudritz solutions ( hereafter pp92 ) to investigate the formation of magneto - centrifugally accelerated outflows in a sb environment .    in ",
    "2 we try to build a consistent sb scenario and examine whether massive nuclear star formation may be present at high enough rates to drive galactic flows out from the surface of the nuclear gas disk produced in the course of the sb evolution . in  3 , we discuss the physical conditions for the nuclear disk to produce collimated outflows based on the observed characteristics of the arp 220 nuclear disk , and estimate the radius , accretion and wind outflow rates , terminal velocities , kinetic energy rates , and magnetic field ranges for which magneto - centrifugal outfows could operate . in  4 , we draw our conclusions and briefly discuss our results .",
    "in an attempt to build consistent starburst scenarios and evaluate their energetics , mass loss , and rate of supernova production , in previous work ( de gouveia dal pino & medina tanco 1997 , hereafter gt97 ) we have calculated the evolution of several starburst stellar clusters based on the evolutionary population synthesis models of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . as initial conditions",
    "we have assumed a salpeter initial stellar mass distribution function [ @xmath31 ] , with a spectral index @xmath32 , and stellar masses in the range [ m@xmath33 = 1 - 8 m@xmath34 , m@xmath35 = 120 m@xmath34 ] ; initial number of stars @xmath37 ( corresponding to cluster radii @xmath38 pc and masses m@xmath39 @xmath40 10@xmath41 - 10@xmath42 m@xmath34 ) ; and an energy deposited by each supernova ( sn ) @xmath43 erg s@xmath3 . assuming also that the system was rotating with an ellipticity @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angular momentum per unit mass ( salpeter and saslaw 1996 , begelman & rees 1978 ) , we have found that part of the gas released by star formation may cool quickly by free - free emission in time scales much smaller than the evolutionary time scales of the system ( @xmath46 yr ) and thus fall towards the centre and settle into a disk with an initial characteristic radius @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , rapid fueling is expected by the large star formation rates and gas conversion into stars detected in nuclear sb regions ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1987 , lo et al .",
    "these observations indicate that fueling should occur in time scales smaller than the conversion time into stars ( @xmath48 yr ) if the gas is to accumulate faster than it is consumed ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun 1997 ) . as an example",
    ", figure 1 ( see also gt97 ) shows the results for a cluster with 3 @xmath49 10@xmath50 m@xmath34 and a core disk which eventually becomes also gravitationally unstable and undergoes star formation ( see below ) .",
    "for a cluster - disk system with masses and radii about ten times larger ( smaller ) than those of fig .",
    "1 , all the luminosity values and supernova rates increase ( decrease ) by an order of magnitude .",
    "as investigated in previous sb - driven outflow models , a strong nuclear sb can , in principle , drive a wide - angled wind out of the system ( see e.g. , ham90 ) .",
    "we will first discuss this process in terms of the energy available to produce winds in a sb system and then , on subsequent sections , examine the mechanism for providing outflow acceleration and collimation .",
    "if an outflow is driven by a sb , then the observed non - thermal radio power ( @xmath51 ) should be correlated with the supernovae production rate ( @xmath4 ) in the sb through ( condon & yin 1990 ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the observed radio frequency , and @xmath54 is the spectral index . using the observed radio power for the seyfert",
    "outflows we find ( see condon et al .",
    "1996 ) @xmath55 ) yr @xmath3 , which is consistent with the predicted values of @xmath4 by the sb models ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "alternatively , simple analytical prescription can be used to estimate the expected supernova production rate @xmath4 as a function of the star formation rate ( sfr ) . for a power law initial stellar mass function , with upper and lower stellar mass cutoffs @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ,",
    "respectively , we have ( e.g. , scoville & soifer 1991 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the minimum mass for supernova detonation , or @xmath60 which shows that sfr @xmath61 result sn rates consistent with those required to explain the observed radio power in sey outflows .    in the case of the ligs ,",
    "the observed infrared luminosities imply star formation rates sfr @xmath40 16 - 125 @xmath62 yr@xmath3 .",
    "sbs models with these sfr result in supernova rates @xmath63 0.1 - 2 yr@xmath3 ( sll98 ) .",
    "these are also consistent with the @xmath4 values required by the observed non - thermal radio luminosity in these objects . in the particular case of the arp 220 source ,",
    "the supernova rate required by the observed non - thermal radio power is @xmath63 2 yr@xmath3 ( which is in agreement with the predicted rate by a sb model with cluster and disk masses an order of magnitude larger than those shown in fig . 1 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "sbs with @xmath4 @xmath40 5 @xmath65 10@xmath66 - 2 yr@xmath3 may inject @xmath67 energy into the ambient medium at a rate ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "1 ; ham90 ) @xmath68 which is comparable to both the rate of gravitational energy released by the infalling gas and the sn luminosity in the core disk of the sb models ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1 , for which @xmath4 @xmath6 0.2 yr@xmath3 , and @xmath69 erg s@xmath3 ) , and smaller than ( @xmath6 20 % ) the observed bolometric luminosities of the sources ( @xmath70 for typical ligs and sey galaxies ) .",
    "in fact , we will see later (  3 ) that only a fraction of this sn energy rate is actually necessary to power the outflow .",
    "the remaining sn energy will be possibly lost in radiation , as indicaterd by recent numerical studies ( thornton , gaudletz , janka , & steinmetz 1998 )",
    "in the previous section , we have assumed that a rotating nuclear disk of gas is produced during the sb evolution and have evaluated the amount of @xmath67 energy that such a system is able to inject into the ambient medium .",
    "now , before deriving the conditions for outflow acceleration and collimation from the surface of the disk , we must explore fiducial physical parameters for the disk . in earlier studies of sb - driven , wide - angled super - winds ( e.g. , ham90 ) ,",
    "global physical conditions were derived for the central regions ( radius @xmath6 1 kpc ) of sb galaxies . here ,",
    "since we are focusing on the inner regions ( located within few tens of pcs radii from the nucleus ) of systems with potential coexistence of a sb - agn activity , we take the observed data of the nuclear disk of the lig prototype , arp 220 ( syb97 ) .",
    "high - resolution co imaging and dust continuum emission of the nuclear region of arp 220 has revealed the presence of a rotating disk feature of molecular gas with mean density @xmath71 2 @xmath65 10@xmath72 @xmath21 , a radius @xmath40 250 pc , and two stellar nuclei at @xmath27 235 pc from the center .",
    "most of the disk mass resides in the molecular gas , rather than in the stars , and most of the molecular gas ( m@xmath73 @xmath10 5.4 @xmath65 10@xmath74 m@xmath34 ) is concentrated in a very thin disk within the double nuclei distance from the center .",
    "the fact that the bulk of the molecular gas has relaxed into a disk with large mass of gas concentrated interior to the double stellar nuclei is consistent with a scenario in which the gas in merging systems settles into the center faster than the stellar components of the sb .",
    "the mass in the arp 220 disk is approximately distributed according to the empirical relation ( see fig . 8 of syb97 ) @xmath75 with @xmath76 1.66 ( for @xmath77 200 pc ) .",
    "the rotation velocity is related to the mass distribution through the simple spherical approximation @xmath78 .    for a self - gravitating disk , the effective thickness ( h ) of the gas",
    "can be obtained from the standard condition of hydrostatic equilibrium ( spitzer 1942 ) , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 90 km s@xmath3 is the vertical dispersion velocity ( syb97 ) , and @xmath81 is the mass surface density of the disk . within a radius r @xmath40 200 pc and @xmath82 @xmath40 5 @xmath65 10@xmath74 m@xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath83 m@xmath34 pc@xmath84 for arp 220 , so that @xmath85 this implies a thin disk at r @xmath40 200 pc with @xmath86 . in the inner region it can be thicker however .",
    "the stability of the gas disk to axi - symmetric perturbations has been examined by syb97 who have used the toomre ( 1964 ) criterion @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 is the epicyclic frequency ) .",
    "the fact that q @xmath89 1 within r @xmath40 400 pc implies that the gas disk is unstable and will develop large density enhancements , ultimately leading to the formation of massive star clusters in the disk .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous assumption of a disk originated in a sb environment also processing star formation .",
    "the extreme gas densities in the central disk of arp 220 ( @xmath90 @xmath21 ) will result in high accretion rates .",
    "assuming a viscous transport of angular momentum , syb97 have used the pringle ( 1981 ) treatment to estimate the rate of gas accretion as a function of the disk radius . for the typical arp 220 parameters , they found accretion rates @xmath91 100 @xmath62 yr@xmath3 peaking at @xmath27 250 pc ( which corresponds to a kinematic viscosity @xmath92 @xmath93 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "we now must check whether the above accretion rate @xmath94 is consistent with the range of temperatures and pressures estimated for the disk .",
    "accretion through the disk implies that there is dissipation of energy into the disk .",
    "for a self - luminous disk the temperature as a function of the radius is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . using the accretion rate mentioned above we estimate @xmath97 which is consistent with the temperatures estimated from the oh observations in arp 220 ( @xmath98 17 - 21 k ; syb97 ) .",
    "the sound speed at this radius would be @xmath99 km s@xmath3 , and the disk pressure @xmath100 we note , however , that in our sb / disk model , massive star formation may still be occurring after the formation of the disk and even in the disk itself .",
    "in such a case , one would expect the presence of an ionized , warmer gas component produced in interactions between the ejected matter in the sb ( e.g. , ham90 ) . a disk with a dominant warm gas component ( with t@xmath101 @xmath98 10@xmath102 k ) would have a higher pressure @xmath103 dy cm@xmath84 . in any case , no matter whether the inner disk is cold ( i.e. , presently not undergoing massive star formation ) or warm , the magneto - centrifugal mechanism for outflow production that will be discussed below is applicable to both .",
    "previous sb - driven modeling of wide - angled super - winds ( e.g. , tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 , de young & gallagher 1990 , suchkov et al .",
    "1994 ) have shown that the multiple action of stellar winds and sn explosions may lead to the formation of a shell of shocked disk material which , after blowout , is dragged to the halo , where it forms the walls of a bi - conical cavity .",
    "this would , ultimately , create conditions for a free directed escape of hot gas at the later , more vigorous sn dominated phase of the sb .",
    "formulation derived by mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) and mac low , mccray , & norman ( 1989 ) gives a simple condition for a sb - driven outflow to blow out of the atmosphere above the disk .",
    "the rate of energy released by the sn , l@xmath105 ( eq .",
    "4 ) , must satisfy @xmath106 which is a condition more than satisfied by the candidate systems , which have @xmath107 ( eq .",
    "we note that this condition still holds for more compact , denser disks with , for example , @xmath108 1 pc , n@xmath109 @xmath21 , and p@xmath73 @xmath110 10@xmath66 dy cm@xmath84 .",
    "the results above suggest that nuclear sbs may satisfy the conditions for driving winds out of the galactic core of the seyferts and ligs , but , how to explain the collimated morphology of the observed outflows that we are investigating and their acceleration ?",
    "one could invoke a thick gas torus surrounding the core to collimate the `` wind '' in a similar way to that proposed in standard models for agn ( see , e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) . as mentioned earlier",
    ", hydrodynamic models for sb super - winds predict the formation of a cavity that provides a natural channel for vertical escape of the gas ejected by the sn .",
    "recently , tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun ( 1997 ) , have explored hydrodynamic solutions in which the rapid fall of disk matter towards the center develops a shock front in the inner region of the disk , and the material crossing it experiences a splash and is ejected vertically to the lower pressure zones above the disk , thus forming a ( poorly collimated ) kpc - long cone .",
    "all these models seem to be able to provide appropriate conditions for the creation of the observed , poor - collimated super - winds emerging from the kpc - scale galactic disks of sb galaxies . here ,",
    "in our investigation of the dynamics of nuclear sb / disks , we examine another potential mechanism in which efficient collimation and outflow acceleration is provided by magnetic fields anchored into the core disk of the sb @xmath111 an assumption that is supported by the observation of magnetic fields in the outflows of the seyferts ( b @xmath112 g at few kpc above the disk ; colbert et al .",
    "such mechanism could also , in principle , be operating in the inner ( possibly unobservable ) regions of wide - angled super - winds of normal sb galaxies .    in a magnetized gas under low ionization fraction condition , for an outflow to be launched the neutral component must be well coupled with the ions ( e.g. wardle & knigl 1993 ) .",
    "this coupling is described by @xmath113 , the ratio of the dynamical time to the mean collision time of a neutral atom in a diluted sea of ions ( e.g. wardle & knigl , shu et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ) , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the density of ions and @xmath116 is the rotational velocity of a particle in a circular orbit . when @xmath117 the neutrals move with the ions and so can be described as well coupled to the magnetic field . here",
    "g@xmath3 s@xmath3 is the drag coefficient between ions and neutrals and @xmath115 , the density of ions , is the product of the atomic mass of the ions , the ionization fraction and the total density .",
    "we can then estimate @xmath120 for clouds with temperatures , abundances and column densities not much different from those in the disk examined here , friaa & jafelice ( 1998 ) have found that the ionization state is roughly inversely correlated with the density . from their curves",
    "we have estimated the corresponding value of @xmath121 for our density and temperature ranges .",
    "we conclude that over the whole disk @xmath117 and the neutrals can be said to be well coupled to the ions .",
    "however this does not mean that the particles are necessarily well coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "the magneto - centrifugal wind models can operate where the charged particles are sufficiently coupled to the field lines that they are flung out centrifugally from the outer layers of the disk ( for a favorable field geometry ; see below ) .",
    "this occurs when the magnetic reynold s number is @xmath122 .",
    "we can estimate the magnetic reynolds number as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the magnetic resistivity , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is the electric conductivity determined from collisions between electrons and h@xmath127 molecules , @xmath128 s@xmath3 ( where @xmath129 is the cross section for @xmath130 collisions , @xmath131 is the relative velocity between them , and @xmath132 is the maxwellian mean of the product ; hayashi 1981 , takata & stevenson 1996 ) . using the arp disk parameters we estimate @xmath133 so that we can assume that the magnetic field is well coupled to the gas .",
    "collimated winds may be produced by a rotating disk with a magnetic field ( @xmath134 ) anchored into it ( see , e.g. , spruit 1996 and refereces therein ) .",
    "the magnetic field and disk structure will determine how much mass is launched out of the disk .    as remarked before",
    ", we here assume that the field is produced due to magnetic flux capture from the environment during the formation of the disk in the sb , followed by advection and compression by the accretion process .",
    "poloidal flux capture in this way can not be destroyed by local processes in the disk , it can only escape by diffusing radially outward ( e.g. , spruit 1996 ) .",
    "it is out of the scope of this work to formulate a theory for ( turbulent ) diffusion in the accretion disk , so that we can not reliably predict the distribution of the magnetic field .",
    "however , since all the energy densities are expected to increase towards the center , it is reasonable to assume that the field will increase inward as well and form an opening field geometry .",
    "as argued by spruit , stehle , & papaloizou ( 1995 ) , fields with such a configuration can be quite strong , with magnetic energy densities exceeding the gas pressure , which must make them ideal for magnetic outflow production .    just above the disk ,",
    "the gas density is typically low enough , so that the magnetic energy density is large compared with the thermal and rotational energies . the field in this region",
    "may be thus assumed to be force - free ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field lines that raise from the disk are somewhat like rigid wires that control the flow .",
    "the gas of the disk surface will be forced to corrotate with the field lines raising out of the disk .",
    "for a sufficiently cold disk , the solely forces acting on a parcel of gas will be the gravitational force and the centrifugal force due to rotation .",
    "along the field line above the disk , the centrifugal force will increase with the distance from the axis and the effective gravity decrease .",
    "when the centrifugal force component along the line exceeds that of gravity , the gas tied to the field line is accelerated outward .",
    "this outward centrifugal acceleration continues up to the alfvn point [ the location where the outflow poloidal speed reaches the alfvn speed , @xmath136 , and stops when the flow attains the fast magnetosonic point . at that point ,",
    "the field is no longer strong enough to enforce corrotation . beyond the alfvn surface ( @xmath137 ) ,",
    "the inertia of the gas causes it to lag behind the rotation of the field line , and the field winds up thus developing a strong azimuthal component ( @xmath138 ) . the magnetic stress force associated to the azimuthal field [ @xmath139 ) , where r is the radial distance from the disk axis ] will provide the flow collimation ( see e.g. , pp92 , spruit 1996 ) .    a self - gravitating accretion disk with an accretion rate @xmath94 releases a known amount of gravitational binding energy of gas as it spirals inward to the center .",
    "the presence of viscous stress causes the gravitational binding energy to transform into heating and the angular momentum is radially transported outward by turbulent stress . in the presence of magnetic fields , however , part of the gravitational energy released in the accretion is converted into mechanical energy of a wind . in addition",
    ", the angular momentum is efficiently transported by the wind through the disk surface , and the wind mass - loss rate @xmath140 has only to be a tiny fraction of @xmath94 ( see , e.g. , pp92 and references therein ) . using the disk angular momentum equation",
    "one can show that as long as the magnetic pressure is comparable or larger than the gas thermal pressure , the magnetic torque will completely dominate the viscous torque ( e.g. pp92 ) .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the magnetic to the viscous torque is @xmath141 where @xmath142 1 is the shakura - sunyaev viscous prescription ( e.g. , frank , king , & raine 1992 ) , and @xmath143 is the alfvn radius .",
    "thus , since @xmath144 , and the magnetic pressure in the disk ( @xmath145 dy cm@xmath84 ; see below ) is effectivelly of the order or larger than the thermal pressure ( eq . 8) , we expect that the angular momentum loss through the wind will dominate .    in magneto - centrifugal disk outflows , the angular momentum of the wind",
    "is tied to that of the disk , and so the wind flux is directly related to the accretion rate , @xmath94 , through the disk . to investigate specific conditions under which collimated winds could be generated in the sb / disk scenario drawn in the previous paragraphs , we here follow the non - self - similar , steady - state , magneto - centrifugally driven wind models developed by pp92 . in their solutions ,",
    "the angular velocity of the disk is assumed to be a power law of the magnetic flux , @xmath146 .",
    "they have found that for a power law index @xmath147 , the outflow carries a constant current intensity everywhere and is free of the divergence found in self - similar models ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "we here adopt this relation .",
    "now , according to eq . 5 , the angular velocity scales with the disk radius as @xmath148",
    "therefore , the magnetic flux will also be a power law of the radius , @xmath149 this , in turn , implies the following relation for the poloidal magnetic field in the disk as a function of the radius ( pp92 ) , @xmath150 , with @xmath151 , or @xmath152 where @xmath153 g is the average value inferred from the observations of the sey outflows at the kpc - scale , @xmath154 pc .    in these models ,",
    "the ratio of the radius @xmath155 to the alfven radius , @xmath143 , @xmath156 , can be determined by the parameter ( pp92 ) @xmath157 for a wind to be produced the field lines must be more than @xmath158 from normal to the disk and @xmath159 .",

    "we note , however , that it is sensitive to the adopted value of the magnetic field on the large scales @xmath166 which is only barely known .",
    "( notice that eq .",
    "15 implies @xmath167 g on the disk surface at @xmath163 . )    for these models the mass flux in the wind , @xmath140 , is related to the accretion rate through the disk by ( pp92 ) @xmath168 where @xmath169    ham90 have estimated values for @xmath140 for wide - angled super - winds observed in far - infrared galaxies ranging from a few @xmath62 yr@xmath3 in the low - power sources ( e.g. , m82 ) , up to @xmath40 50 @xmath62 yr@xmath3 in powerful sources ( like arp 220 and mrk 273 ) .",
    "these values correspond to the total amount of mass loss rate integrated over the whole radius of those winds . in the inner , few tens of pc scales",
    ", @xmath140 is expected to be smaller .",
    "in fact , in our model , @xmath140 approximately scales as @xmath140 @xmath170 ( eq .",
    "6.7 of pp92 ) , or according to eq .",
    "14 above , @xmath140 @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , the value @xmath140 @xmath40 50 @xmath62 yr@xmath3 for the arp 220 outflow will correspond to disk radius @xmath172 100 pc .",
    "we can then assume that in the inner few pcs @xmath173 10 @xmath62 yr@xmath3 and take @xmath174 .",
    "this value is compatible with estimates for ysos and agn outflow models ( see , e.g. pp92 and references therein ) . substituting this value into eqs .",
    "19 , and 20 above , we can then estimate a fiducial value for the ratio @xmath175 at a fiducial radius @xmath176 , and according to eq .",

    "they indicate the presence of a high speed pre - shocked wind gas that was possibly decelerated to these velocities . in the case of arp 220 ,",
    "the observation of line widths declining from @xmath190 km s@xmath189 near the axis of the outflow to @xmath191 km s@xmath189 at the outer radius are also consistent with the prediction of our model of a decreasing outflow velocity with radius . on the other hand , the estimates above are higher than the observed outflow speeds in the seyfert outflows ( @xmath192 km s@xmath3 ; condon et al .",
    "1996 ) . nonetheless , according to eq .",
    "24 , these observations can be fitted by a more compact disk ( like that of fig .",
    "1 , for instance ) with a somewhat larger ratio @xmath193 ( eq . 21 ) .",
    "21 , 22 , 24 and 25 indicate that disks with @xmath194 10 pc and @xmath195 0.1 will provide @xmath196 in better agreement with the observed sey outflows .    in summary ,",
    "the results above indicate that the observed terminal outflow velocities are consistent with an outflow generation in the described sb - disk scenario with wind mass loss to disk accretion rate ratios @xmath197 .",
    "one of the attractions of a magnetically driven outflow model is that it is able not only to produce and collimate the outflow , but also to efficiently extract angular momentum from the disk , allowing it to collapse ( e.g. blandford 1976 , pp92 ) .",
    "just a small fraction of the infalling mass , like that estimated above , is required to be carried out by the outflow for it to take out most of the angular momentum of the system .",
    "further , in the outflow model investigated here , it is easy to show that the total kinetic power carried by the wind is exactly one - half of the gravitational energy released in the accretion disk , i.e. , @xmath198 $ ] , where @xmath199 is the disk mass within @xmath163 .",
    "again , using the arp 220 parametrization , we find that @xmath200 .\\ ] ] this can be compared with the sn energy rate estimated for the arp 220 disk , @xmath201 7 @xmath65 10@xmath202 erg s@xmath3 ( eq .",
    "4 ) , which results @xmath203 , so that the total kinetic power carried by the magneto - centrifugally driven outflow is much smaller than the available sn energy rate predicted by the sb models .",
    "the fact that the open field lines must have an inclination angle with respect to the disk not larger than @xmath204 ( pp92 ) results that the height @xmath205 of the alfvn surface is @xmath206 tan @xmath207 , or @xmath208    we can also estimate the outflow number density at the alfvn surface ( and beyond ) from the condition that @xmath209 ( pp92 ) , and according to eq .",
    "14 , @xmath210 . using the number density at the base of the disk , which was estimated from the arp 220 disk , @xmath211 @xmath21",
    ", the relation above implies that @xmath212    according to pp92 models , the flow will recollimate beyond the fast - magnetosonic ( fm ) point .",
    "the mach number at this point is @xmath213    substituting the value of @xmath182 given by eq .",
    "( 25 ) we find @xmath214 2.4",
    ". thus flows achieving modest fm - mach number @xmath215 must recollimate and form magnetic focal points beyond about a hight @xmath216 pc .",
    "sbs with a disk core formed by infalling gas produced during star formation in a rotating stellar cluster , seem to be able to provide the amount of energy required to drive the weak , directed outflows of seyferts galaxies and ligs . in the latter source class , for example",
    ", there seems to be strong observational support for the presence of nuclear sbs ( e.g. , sll98 ) .",
    "we have found that massive nuclear sbs with cluster masses @xmath217 , disk masses @xmath218 , and supernova rates @xmath2 yr@xmath3 ( which are consistent with the inferred @xmath219 from the observed non - thermal radio power ) may inject kinetic energies @xmath220 erg s@xmath3 which are high enough to blow out directed winds from the accreting disk surface (  2 ) , within the sb lifetimes .    in our models , the acceleration and collimation of the outflow is provided by moderate magnetic fields anchored into the rotating sb - disk . based on empirical conditions derived from the disk of the prototype lig , arp 220 , and the magnetized outflows of sey galaxies and ligs , we have found that magnetic fields with intensities @xmath221 g are able to accelerate the flow up to the observed terminal velocities ( @xmath6 few 100 km s@xmath3 in the case of the seyferts , and @xmath222 km s@xmath3 in the case of the ligs ) , with wind mass loss to disk accretion rate ratios @xmath8 ( where @xmath223 yr@xmath3 ) . the outflow carries only a small fraction ( few percent ) of the available sn kinetic energy rate , and is produced within a wind zone in the disk of radius @xmath6 100 pc in the case of the ligs , and @xmath6 10 pc in the case of the seyfert outflows (  3 ) .",
    "the model also predicts a decay of the terminal velocity with radius which is compatible with observations .",
    "the formation of an outflow in the proposed sb - magnetized disk scenario depends on a series of conditions which are evolutionary linked , such as , the initial amount of angular momentum and ellipticity in the central stellar cluster that will provide the formation of the rotating disk of gas from the sb ; the development of an appropriate magnetic field geometry with open lines during disk collaps ; and the ionization state of the gas which must be large enough to couple the magnetic field to the gas .",
    "sb - driven outflows are observed not only in ir luminous nuclear sb systems , but also in other galaxy types , as for example , blue compacts and irregular dwarf galaxies like ngc 1569 ( e.g. , greggio et al .",
    "the collimation - acceleration mechanism here described could , in principle , also apply to the inner regions of the wide - angled super - winds observed in these systems .",
    "they could also anchor a nuclear magnetized disk generated during the sb if the initial conditions for the sb were not very much different from those described here .",
    "however , in the case of the amorphous dwarf systems like ngc 1569 , which is actually a post - sb system , it is not unlikeley that the sb - driven large - scale wind had stripped the dwarf of most of its gas before the gas had time to partially collect into the center and develop a nuclear rotating disk and a more collimated , coherent outflow portion . in forthcoming work",
    ", we aim to explore self - consistent numerical models to examine the dynamical evolution of outflows produced by a rotating magnetized disk originated in different sb environments and determine their range of applicability . for that purpose",
    ", we will employ a modified version of a 3-d numerical sph code originally designed for supersonic jet studies ( e.g. , de gouveia dal pino & benz 1993 , de gouveia dal pino & birkinshaw 1996 , cerqueira & de gouveia dal pino 1998 ) .",
    "pure hydrodynamic models ( e.g. , suchkov et al . 1994 ) make specific predictions for the observed abundance pattern in the sb - driven super - winds . in those models , the material at the wall of the vertical cavity , for example",
    ", is mostly composed of unprocessed ism gas that has been shock - heated by the emerging outflow , while the enriched material that is ejected by the sn should fill the interior of the cavity .",
    "similarly , as a collimated magnetized outflow impinges supersonically the ambient medium , it must create a bow shock pattern at the outer edge ( see , e.g. , cerqueira , de gouveia dal pino , & herant 1997 ) where most of the shocked material that produces the emission lines is made of ism gas with no significant abundance enrichment .",
    "the observed optical emission lines should then trace normal abundances just like predicted in hydrodynamical models .",
    "the hotter , enriched material that is ejected by the sn should emerge mainly along with the collimated outflow .",
    "we note that in our disk model the magnetic pressure in the disk may exceed the gas pressure .",
    "this may cause the disk to become unstable to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "in such a case , the magnetic field lines may arise in loops from the disk surface and undergo reconnection .",
    "this could in turn provide the formation of hot filamentary and clumpy structure on the disk corona .",
    "it is interesting to note that a @xmath224 disk corona is required by the x - ray and @xmath225-ray observations of the nuclear region of sey galaxies in order to explain their complex high - energy spectra ( e.g. , johnson et al . 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we should inquire about the fate of the sb disk ( see also gt97 ) .",
    "we have seen that it may rapidly become self - gravitating (  2.2 ) . as a consequence",
    ", it is expected to suffer fragmentation and star formation . either",
    ", the disk may become bar unstable , a condition which is met if @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the rotational energy and @xmath228 is the gravitational potential energy of the disk ( e.g. shlosman et al .",
    "our sb disks result @xmath229 , so that they can , in principle , become unstable to bar formation and undergo fission into two components which eventually may collapse to a supermassive bh ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ) . based on the fact that the formation of bhs seems to be plausible in a sb",
    ", we can speculate that both , the standard bh and the sb mechanisms may be occurring in different stages of the agn evolution . in this evolutionary scenario ,",
    "the stronger more collimated jets of radio loud qsos , for example , could be produced in the higher - level activity phase of the bh accreting the remains of the disk material .",
