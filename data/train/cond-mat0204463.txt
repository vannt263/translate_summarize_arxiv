    "_ quantum optics _ exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to optically control atomic systems with highest possible precision @xcite : recent years have seen spectacular examples of such light - matter manipulations , _",
    "e.g. _ , bose - einstein condensation or freezing of light @xcite , as well as the emerging fields of quantum computation and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "evidently , the driving force behind all these efforts is to explore the consequences of quantum mechanics in real physical systems  possibly up to their most far reaching limits .",
    "this tremendous success of _ quantum optics _ also initiated great stimulus in the field of solid - state physics .",
    "in particular with semiconductor quantum dots @xcite , or _ ` artificial atoms ' _ as they are sometimes called because of their atomic - like carrier states , one now has a system at hand which resembles many of the atomic properties whilst offering at the same time all the flexibility of semiconductor nanostructures : such remarkable features suggest the implementation of quantum - optical schemes in this novel class of materials .    indeed , this synthesis of _ quantum optics _ and low - dimensional semiconductor physics formed the primary research topic of giovanna panzarini s activities . in the last years",
    "her main interest was focused on the identification of quantum - optical schemes with a successful history in atom physics and a promising future for quantum - dot implementations .",
    "two of these proposals , which giovanna developed in collaboration with us , will be reviewed here .",
    "we have organized our paper as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro - dot ] we briefly summarize our present understanding of carrier states in quantum dots ; based on this discussion , we set out in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] to develop our theoretical framework ; sects .",
    "[ sec : stirap ] and [ sec : sit ] present results of our calculations where we analyze two prototypical examples of strong radiation - matter interaction ; finally , we draw in sect .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] some conclusions and present an outlook to future developments .",
    "quantum dots consist of a small island of lower - bandgap material embedded in a solid - state matrix of higher - bandgap material ; proper choice of the material and dot parameters thus can give rise to the confinement of a few carrier states within this lower - bandgap region , resulting in discrete , atomic - like spectra and strongly enhanced lifetimes . without aiming at an exhaustive discussion , in the following we outline our present understanding of carrier dynamics in quantum dots , which will guide us in developing our theoretical description scheme in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "more specifically , we shall address few - particle states and coulomb renormalizations , dephasing and relaxation , and interdot coupling and tailoring of optical properties .    in contradistinction to ` natural ' atoms , the confinement potential of artificial atoms is not identical because of dot - size and material fluctuations inherent to any growth procedure @xcite .",
    "as consequence , all optical experiments suffer from large inhomogeneous line broadenings , which spoil the observation of finestructure splittings characteristic for zero - dimensional systems . a major advancement in the field has come from different types of local optical experiments , that allow the investigation of individual quantum dots thus avoiding inhomogeneous broadening @xcite : indeed , such _ single - dot spectroscopy _ revealed a surprisingly rich fine - structure of the optical spectra for both multi - excitons @xcite and multi - charged excitons @xcite .",
    "for our present purpose , the essential characteristics of these findings can be summarized as follows : first , because of the strong confinement quantum dots can host various electron - hole complexes which would be unstable in semiconductors of higher dimensionality ; second , whenever one or more carriers are put into a quantum dot the optical spectra change because of the resulting additional coulomb interactions @xcite . as consequence ,",
    "each quantum - dot spectrum uniquely reflects its electron - hole configuration .",
    "furthermore , because of dot - size fluctuations these spectral fingerprints vary from dot to dot , and thus allow to spectroscopically address specific quantum dots .    in the early days of dot spectroscopy",
    "there was an intense debate whether the phase - space restrictions imposed by the strong quantum confinement would inhibit phonon - induced carrier relaxation and dephasing of optically excited carrier states , and led to the prediction of the so - called `` phonon bottleneck '' effect .",
    "however , experimental evidence indicates that whenever an electron - hole complex can relax to a state of lower energy by phonon emission , the corresponding transition occurs on a relatively short timescale , and no clear evidence for a phonon bottleneck was reported .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the nature of phonon scatterings in quantum dots can be substantially different as compared to semiconductors of higher dimensionality : in particular if the energy difference between two states does not match the phonon energy , additional scattering and dephasing channels , such as polaron - mediated relaxation @xcite or multi - phonon processes @xcite , are required . generally speaking , for a given electron - hole configuration long dephasing and lifetimes",
    "can only be expected for the respective state of lowest energy , whereas `` excited '' states relax much faster .",
    "recently , borri  @xcite extracted from low - temperature photon - echo experiments exciton lifetimes that were indeed solely governed by the radiative exciton decay .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the possibility of tailoring dot and environment coupling .",
    "in most growth procedures it is relatively simple to produce vertically coupled quantum dots @xcite , which , in analogy to molecules , are sometimes referred to as _ ` artificial molecules'_. these structures have recently attracted increasing interest both in view of basic research @xcite as well as of possible quantum computation applications @xcite .",
    "additionally , semiconductor quantum dots can be combined with other semiconductor - based optical components such as microcavities or photonic crystals , thus allowing for a highly flexible control of environment interactions .",
    "in the following we shall consider the problem of carriers confined in a quantum dot under the action of external laser fields .",
    "the carriers will experience their mutual coulomb interactions as well as the interaction with phonons and other environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to describe the problem by the hamiltonian :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 accounts for the carrier states ; the light - matter interaction @xmath2 is described in the dipole approximation @xcite , with @xmath3 the electric field of the laser and @xmath4 the interband polarization operator ; finally , @xmath5 describes the environmental ( _ `` reservoir '' _ ) degrees of freedom , which are coupled through @xmath6 to the carriers in the dot .      from our introductory discussion it has become clear that coulomb renormalization effects are of crucial importance for the description of few - particle states in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "in contrast to higher - dimensional semiconductors , mutual coulomb interactions among quantum dot carriers do not result in scattering and dephasing but solely give rise to energy renormalizations .",
    "consequently , coulomb correlation effects in dots are conveniently accounted for within a first - principles manner , _",
    "e.g. _ , using the framework of configuration interactions @xcite . with @xmath7 labeling the few - particle states and @xmath8 the corresponding energies ,",
    "the hamiltonian accounting for the carrier states is of the form :    @xmath9    note that , although the few - particle level scheme @xmath8 can be fairly complicated and dependent on a number of decisive material and dot parameters , in the simulation of the carrier time dynamics one often only needs a limited information about @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , if the laser frequencies are tuned to the exciton groundstate , it completely suffices to know the energies of the exciton and biexciton groundstates together with the optical matrix elements connecting these states ; these few parameters can then be inferred from experiment or calculated from theory ( see , _ e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "@xmath10    it thus is physical intuition together with the proper choice of the excitation scenario which allows to reduce a complicated few - particle problem , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , to a relatively simple few - level scheme .",
    "this situation is quite different as compared to the description of carrier dynamics in higher - dimensional semiconductors , where such a clear cut separation is not possible because of the scattering - type nature of carrier - carrier interactions ; it is , however , completely similar to _ quantum optics _ which relies on phenomenological level schemes , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath11- or v - type schemes , with a few effective parameters  a highly successful approach despite the tremendously complicated nature of true atomic states .",
    "suppose that a dot initially in its vacuum state ,  no electrons and holes present , is subject to a laser excitation : the light - matter interaction will induce an _ interband polarization _ , which , in the language of semiconductor physics , can be described in terms of electron - hole pairs . quite generally , the fast time dynamics introduced by the laser has to be treated with some care . to see that",
    ", we first note that the energy splitting between few - particle states @xmath8 with different numbers of electron - hole pairs @xmath12 is much larger than any energy splitting between states of the same @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we separate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) these different energy scales _ viz . _ :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is an energy of the order of the bandgap ( @xmath15 throughout ) and the detunings @xmath16 are small as compared to @xmath14 .",
    "correspondingly , we express the electric field of the laser as @xmath17 , with the time - dependent envelope @xmath18 . in what follows",
    ", we make use of the dipole and rotating - wave approximations : the first approximation states that light can only induce transitions between states differing by _ one _ electron - hole pair ; within the interaction representation according to @xmath19 , the interband dipole operator @xmath4 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) can thus be split into terms with time dependencies of @xmath20 , respectively ; in the latter approximation , we keep in @xmath21 only terms where this fast oscillatory time dependence cancels out and neglect the remaining @xmath22 terms in the spirit of the random - phase approximation .",
    "hence , the light - matter interaction reads :    @xmath23    with @xmath24 the optical dipole matrix elements @xcite , where state @xmath25 has one electron - hole pair less than @xmath7 .",
    "further below we shall find it convenient to introduce the ( time - dependent ) rabi frequencies @xmath26 .",
    "although in this paper we consider spontaneous emission of photons as the only source of dephasing and relaxation , we shall find it convenient to describe environment coupling in terms of a more generalized caldeira ",
    "leggett - type model @xcite    @xmath27    suited also for the description of , _ e.g. _ , phonon interactions . here",
    "@xmath28 labels the environmental degrees of freedom with energy @xmath29 ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the bosonic field operators ; and @xmath32 are the matrix elements for transitions between the few - particle states @xmath7 and @xmath25 through excitation of @xmath28 . for the coupling to the propagating photon modes we obtain : @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the photon wavevector and polarization , respectively ; @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the speed of light in the semiconductor ; @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the semiconductor dielectric constant and @xmath40 the unit vector of the light polarization .      after having specified our theoretical model in the previous section , we now set out to derive our central master equation ; in so doing we shall be guided by the different time scales introduced by the laser excitation ( fast ) and dephasing and relaxation ( slow ) .",
    "we hence separate the _ coherent _ and _ incoherent _ time dynamics introduced by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "as we aim at a description of the coherent and incoherent dynamics , we describe the quantum dot system through its density - matrix @xmath43 @xcite , whose diagonal elements @xmath44 describe the occupation of the few - particle states @xmath7 , and the off - diagonal terms @xmath45 account for the coherence between states @xmath7 and @xmath25 .      from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) and ( [ eq : hop ] ) and using the liouville von - neumann equation we obtain within the interaction representation according to @xmath19 for the coherent time dynamics @xmath46 $ ] , where :    @xmath47      in contrast to the coherent time dynamics , coupling to a reservoir , which acts as a heat bath , can not be described exactly .",
    "hence , we are forced to pursue from the beginning an approximative approach .",
    "quite generally , we shall make the following assumptions : firstly , scatterings occur seldomly on a time scale characteristic for the laser - induced coherent dynamics  an assumption which certainly holds for low temperature and considering only the groundstates in the subspaces of given @xmath12 ; secondly , scatterings are fast processes which can be treated as almost instantaneous  a well - controlled approximation which imposes some restrictions on the spectral density of the reservoir and the dot - reservoir coupling strength @xcite ; thirdly , in the description of scatterings the carrier dynamics is dominated by @xmath1 , and @xmath41 only introduces minor corrections . in more technical terms , these assumptions guarantee that we can use the adiabatic and markov approximations .",
    "hence , the dot - reservoir interaction can be described in second order time - dependent perturbation theory as @xcite :    @xmath48,\\ ] ]    with @xmath49 the density matrix of the reservoir and @xmath50 denoting the trace over the environmental degrees of freedom ( note that in eq .",

    "( [ eq : reservoir ] ) which describe scattering and dephasing , thus neglecting the minor real - parts of energy renormalizations due to environment coupling . for the sake of brevity",
    "we omit the rather lengthy but straightforward calculation , and simply state our final result which combines the coherent and incoherent time dynamics of eqs .",

    "let us first consider the @xmath11-type level scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]*a * : it consists of two long - lived states @xmath69 and @xmath70 which are optically connected through a third short - lived state @xmath71 . in ref .",

    "[ fig : stirap]*b * suggests that there is a more efficient way for a population transfer : here , the two pulses are applied in the `` counter - intuitive '' order ,  the pump pulse is turned on _ after _ the stokes pulse . because of the resemblance of this scheme with a raman - type process it has become convenient to introduce the expression of a _ stokes _",
    "pulse , and the whole process has been given the name _ stimulated raman adiabatic passage _",
    "( stirap ) @xcite . as will be discussed below",
    ", stirap  is a process which fully exploits the quantum coherence introduced by the intense laser fields : in presence of the stokes pulse the dot - states become renormalized , and these renormalized states are used by the pump pulse for a robust and high - fidelity population transfer . while fig .",
    "[ fig : stirap ] presents results based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , in our following discussion we shall introduce a few simplifying assumptions : first , we assume that the pump pulse _ only _ affects the 13 transition and the stokes pulse _ only _ the 23 one , an assumption certainly valid for rabi frequencies much smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the time evolution is governed by the effective hamiltonian    @xmath90    with @xmath91 and @xmath92 the rabi frequencies for the pump and stokes pulse , respectively .",
    "if @xmath91 and @xmath92 have a sufficiently slow time dependence , as will be specified in more detail further below , at each instant of time we can characterize the system by the eigenvalues and vectors of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stirap ] ) ; straightforward algebra yields for the eigenvalues @xmath93 and @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and for @xmath96 .",
    "most importantly , eigenvalue @xmath97 has no imaginary part and consequently does not suffer radiative losses . indeed , introducing the time - dependent angle @xmath98 _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath99 we observe that the eigenvector    @xmath100    has _ no _ component of the `` leaky '' state @xmath71 , in contrast to the eigenvectors @xmath101 which are composed of all three states @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "thus , in @xmath102 the amplitudes of the 13 and 23 transitions interfere destructively such that the state is completely stable against absorption and emission from the radiation fields ; for that reason , state @xmath102 has been given the name _",
    "trapped state_. the stirap  process uses state @xmath102 as a vehicle in order to transfer population between states @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "coherent population transfer is achieved by using overlap in time between the two laser pulses ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stirap]*a * ) : initially , the system is prepared in state @xmath69 . when the first laser pulse ( stokes ) is smoothly turned on , the double - dot system is excited at frequency @xmath103 .",
    "apparently , at this frequency no transitions can be induced ; what the pulse does , however , is to align the time - dependent state vector @xmath104 with @xmath105 ( since @xmath106 in the sector @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) , and to split the degeneracy of the eigenvalues @xmath97 , @xmath109 .",
    "thus , if the second laser pulse ( pump ) is smoothly turned on such that throughout @xmath110 remains large enough to avoid non - adiabatic transitions between @xmath111 and @xmath112 all population is transferred between states @xmath69 and @xmath70 within an adiabatic process where @xmath104 directly follows the time - dependent trapped state @xmath111 .",
    "stirap  is a process important for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , it is a prototypical example of how intense laser fields can cause drastic renormalizations of carrier states ; quite generally , these `` dressed '' states exhibit novel features in case of quantum interference ,  if three or more states are optically coupled .",
    "secondly , pulse - shaping techniques in quantum dots have recently attracted increasing interest in view of possible quantum computation applications @xcite , aiming at an all - optical control of carrier states ; in this respect , stirap  might be of some importance because of its robustness and its high fidelity .",
    "more specifically , from fig .",
    "[ fig : stirap]*b * it becomes apparent that population transfer works successfully within a relatively large parameter regime  in contrast to the `` intuitive '' order of pulses , where a detailed knowledge of the dipole matrix elements and a precise control over the laser pulses is required .",
    "thus , stirap  is a robust scheme which only relies on sufficiently smooth and strong laser pulses ; we note here in passing that the population transfer is governed by the temporal overlap of the pulses , thus also allowing for the creation of superposition states through appropriate tailoring of the pulse envelopes @xcite .",
    "finally , stirap  processes minimize losses through environment coupling and therefore work with high fidelity ; one can envision that such high - quality performance might be required for quantum computation implementations where information is encoded in spin degrees of freedom and optical control is used for quantum gates , whereby scattering processes during the gating might become the primary source of dephasing .",
    "in our second example we discuss the propagation of an intense laser beam in a sample of inhomogenously broadened quantum dots : as will be shown in the following , above a given threshold the quantum coherence introduced by the laser leads to a drastic modification of the non - linear optical properties , and stable pulse propagation without significant losses becomes possible . throughout",
    "we shall assume that the laser frequency is tuned to the exciton groundstate , and describe the carrier states in terms of the level scheme depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : sit]*b * shows a contour plot of the exciton population as a function of @xmath116 and time , where one clearly observes the above - mentioned excitation and de - excitation of exciton states ; finally , at the highest pulse area , fig .  [ fig : sit]*c * , we observe pulse breakup @xcite ; the inset shows a @xmath139-rotation of the exciton states and an additional population of the biexciton channel . as apparent from the figure",
    ", this biexciton population , which is attributed to the high field strengths corresponding to rabi frequencies comparable to the biexciton binding , does not spoil the general pulse propagation properties .",
    "however , closer inspection reveals that such strong laser pulses create a macroscopic entanglement of exciton states @xmath140 , as will be discussed in more detail elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a general theoretical framework suited for the description of coherent and incoherent dynamics in optically excited semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "this model has been used for the study of two prototypical situations where intense laser fields lead to pronounced renormalizations of carrier states : first , it has been shown how two intense laser pulses can be exploited for a robust and high - fidelity population transfer of carrier states in coupled quantum dots ; second , we have discussed how intense laser pulses can propagate in a sample of inhomogenously broadened quantum dots without suffering significant losses . in a sense , these two examples , as well as the numerous recent reports on related subjects , clearly demonstrate that many surprising effects which hitherto have only been seen in atomic systems have now also become observable in artificial atoms and molecules .",
    "quite generally , the success of _ quantum optics _ steams from the fact that atoms have been studied for many decades , with all fine details of the level structure now being well understood , and that atoms provide both short - lived states , with lifetimes of the order of nanoseconds , as well as states extremely well protected from their environment , with lifetimes of the order of seconds . as concerning artificial atoms and molecules ,",
    "the situation is less clear : on the one hand , there now exists some consensus regarding the basic characteristics of few - particle states in single dots , whereas many issues regarding excited states or properties of artificial molecules still remain to be explored ; on the other hand , the more intimate coupling of quantum dot states to their solid - state environment does not seem to permit the same lifetime diversity as compared to atoms . yet , long - lived excitations , _ e.g. _ spin degrees of freedom , and possible manipulation channels still remain to be identified , and will ultimately make possible or not the solid - state implementation of quantum computation or related schemes in this class of material .    on a more fundamental level ,",
    "the success of quantum optics in quantum dots will strongly depend on the basic differences and on the added value of this class of material in comparison with the high standards of quantum optics in atomic systems . in this respect ,",
    "bi- and multi - excitons ,  excitations consisting of several electron - hole pairs , have recently been demonstrated in the context of single - photon sources as the first of such a clear - cut peculiarity of quantum dots .",
    "thus , risklessly we can say that the whole field of quantum optics in quantum dots is still in its infancy and that many exciting prospects have not even been foreseen today .",
    "our deepest thanks go to giovanna panzarini , who introduced us to most of the ideas that are presented in this paper and who shared with us her physical intuition and her joy for the beauty of physics .",
    "the main pleasure in collaborating with giovanna was to see her studying literature , discovering dozens of new things , and discussing them with us .",
    "she was a hard - working woman who was moving fast from one topic to the other , sometimes a little bit too fast , as if she already knew about the little time that was left .",
    "personally , giovanna kept distance .",
    "although being truly and sympathetically interested in the news of others , her personal life often remained protected .",
    "we all miss her so much . her passion for science , her brilliant and rigorous comments",
    ", her smile and her attentive and passionate presence in the group will always be in our memory .",
    "we will remember the picture of giovanna entering the room with a smile on her face , saying that she just discovered a beautiful , little effect ."
