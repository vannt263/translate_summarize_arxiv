    "geometrical scaling is a phenomenon predicted by the gluon saturation in hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "it was first observed when the total @xmath10 cross sections in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at small @xmath11 were expressed in terms of the variable @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the photon virtuality , @xmath11 is the bjorken variable and @xmath14 is the saturation radius @xcite .",
    "similar geometrical scaling was found in dis on nucleus @xcite and diffractive processes @xcite . in recent years",
    ", geometrical scaling was presented in the @xmath1 spectra of inclusive and identified charged hadrons in proton - proton ( @xmath15 ) collisions at @xmath16 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev @xcite .",
    "as nuclei are made of nucleons , it is nature to extend geometrical scaling to the inclusive charged hadron production in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath17 ) collisions at rhic and lhc energies @xcite . in @xcite , the authors showed when the multiplicity distributions in the central au - au and cu - cu collisions at @xmath0 = 62.4 and 200 gev were plotted as a function of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is number of nucleons in the nuclei , @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 , @xmath5 = 0.30 , a tendency towards geometrical scaling was clearly seen , although the alignment of au and cu spectra was not perfect for small and medium values of @xmath22 .",
    "reference @xcite illustrated that when the @xmath1 spectra in pb - pb 0 - 5@xmath2 , 5 - 10@xmath2 and 40 - 50@xmath2 collisions at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev were expressed in the variable @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the saturation scale and @xmath25 , the data points in the 0 - 5@xmath2 and 5 - 10@xmath2 centralities fell into the same line for @xmath26 , while the data points in the 40 - 50@xmath2 centrality presented some departure .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the data points at 0 - 5@xmath2 , 5 - 10@xmath2 , 10 - 20@xmath2 , 20 - 30@xmath2 , 30 - 40@xmath2 , 40 - 50@xmath2 , 50 - 60@xmath2 , 60 - 70@xmath2 and 70 - 80@xmath2 centralities in pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev .",
    "we find that the inclusive charged hadron @xmath1 spectra at these centralities exhibit geometrical scaling when they are presented in terms of a new scaling variable @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath27 is defined as @xmath3 , @xmath5 is the scaling parameter which is determined by the method of ratios @xcite .",
    "we then use a single tsallis distribution to parameterize the @xmath1 spectra at different centralities , and discuss the consequences of the geometrical scaling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : scaling_variable ] , we will illustrate how the new scaling variable @xmath27 is proposed in terms of the gluon saturation . in section [ sec :",
    "gs_inclusive ] , we will show how the scaling parameter @xmath5 in @xmath27 is determined and then present the geometrical scaling in the inclusive charged hadron @xmath1 spectra . in section [ sec : gs_consequence ]",
    ", we will use the single tsallis distribution to parameterize the spectra at different centralities and discuss the consequences of the geometrical scaling .",
    "finally , the conclusion is made in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "geometrical scaling is a property of particle densities at high energies .",
    "it is based on the underlying mechanism which is called the gluon saturation @xcite .",
    "the geometrical scaling means that the particle spectra are in fact a dimensionless function of the scaling variable @xmath28 , rather than independently of @xmath11 and @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the transverse momentum of an observed particle in high energy collisions , @xmath29 is the saturation momentum , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "for example , in @xmath15 collisions at @xmath16 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev @xcite , the inclusive charged hadron @xmath1 spectra measured at different energies in the central region depend on a single variable , @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the proton saturation momentum scale and is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 = 1 gev and @xmath37 . in @xmath17 collisions , in order to consider the geometrical scaling in the @xmath1 spectra with different centralities , the saturation momentum is modified as @xcite @xmath38 as a result , the corresponding scaling variable for pb - pb collisions is @xmath39 when the @xmath1 spectra of charged hadrons at different centralities in pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev are plotted in terms of @xmath40 , they will migrate into a universal curve @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 . here ,",
    "the transverse areas of the two colliding nuclei for different centralities are deemed to be proportional to @xmath4 , rather than to @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that when considering the effect of running coupling @xmath45 the transverse areas prefer a linear dependence on @xmath4 @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath46 will be referred as the @xmath1 spectrum at @xmath4 in the following .",
    "if the @xmath1 spectra at @xmath4 and @xmath47 are equal , @xmath48 , then they are the distributions of the same @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 which implies @xmath50 this formula allows us to rescale the @xmath1 spectrum at @xmath4 to @xmath47 . as a convention",
    ", we choose the @xmath1 spectrum at the first centrality class ( 0 - 5@xmath2 , @xmath51 ) as a reference and try to rescale the @xmath1 spectra at the other 8 centrality classes ( 5 - 10@xmath2 , 10 - 20@xmath2 , 20 - 30@xmath2 , 30 - 40@xmath2 , 40 - 50@xmath2 , 50 - 60@xmath2 , 60 - 70@xmath2 and 70 - 80@xmath2 ) to this reference .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 .",
    "this @xmath27 is exactly the scaling variable we propose in this paper .",
    "apparently , for the spectrum at @xmath4 , the corresponding @xmath27 only depends on the scaling parameter @xmath5 , while @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nuclei_tau ] ) relies on @xmath36 , @xmath52 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus @xmath27 is a more appropriate variable in searching for the geometrical scaling of the @xmath1 spectra at different centralities in pb - pb collisions .",
    "the @xmath1 spectra of inclusive charged hadron at different centralities in pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev were published by the alice collaboration @xcite .",
    "these spectra will exhibit geometrical scaling when they are presented in terms of @xmath27 with a suitable scaling parameter @xmath5 . in order to estimate this parameter",
    ", we adopt the method of ratios @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a ration is defined in terms of @xmath27 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath1 spectrum rescaled from @xmath4 to @xmath47 , @xmath55 is the @xmath1 spectrum at @xmath47 .",
    "since there are no data points at @xmath3 on the @xmath1 spectrum of @xmath47 , in order to calculate the ratio @xmath56 , we need to interpolate the values at these points . as the spectrum at @xmath47 lies on a curve as a function of @xmath1 ,",
    "we do a shape - preserving piecewise cubic interpolation . in section [ sec : scaling_variable ]",
    ", we have chosen @xmath47 = 191.5 for the 0 - 5@xmath2 centrality and @xmath4 = 165 , 130.5 , 93 , 64.5 , 42.5 , 26.5 , 15 and 7.9 for the 5 - 10@xmath2 , 10 - 20@xmath2 , 20 - 30@xmath2 , 30 - 40@xmath2 , 40 - 50@xmath2 , 50 - 60@xmath2 , 60 - 70@xmath2 and 70 - 80@xmath2 centralities respectively .",
    "thus there are 8 such ratios .",
    "if the geometrical scaling is true , then @xmath57 should be equal to 1 .",
    "however , in practice , @xmath57 is around 1 in a certain @xmath27 range . in order to determine the best value of @xmath5",
    ", we define the mean square deviation between @xmath57 and 1 as follows @xcite , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of data points in the region @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the experimental uncertainty of the ratio @xmath57 . here",
    "we have ignored the interpolation error and the theoretical uncertainty of geometrical scaling hypothesis @xcite , as they are small ( less than 2@xmath2 and around 3@xmath2 respectively ) when compared to the experimental errors ( 8 - 20@xmath2 ) in the region where the geometrical scaling holds .",
    "@xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the @xmath27 ( @xmath1 ) of the first data point where the geometrical scaling starts to appear .",
    "it is determined by @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath65 , the absolute difference between @xmath57 and 1 is either within @xmath61 or above @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the @xmath27 ( @xmath1 ) of the last data point where the geometrical scaling holds up .",
    "it is determined by @xmath68 . for data points with @xmath69 ,",
    "the geometrical scaling is violated .",
    "thus the number of data points which exhibit geometrical scaling is exactly @xmath59 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_square ] ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath59 depends on @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig : n_lambda_vs_lambda ] shows @xmath59 as a function of @xmath5 for different centralities .",
    "the best value of @xmath5 is determined to be the one which maximizes the sum of @xmath59 at 5 - 10@xmath2 , 10 - 20@xmath2 , 20 - 30@xmath2 , 30 - 40@xmath2 , 40 - 50@xmath2 , 50 - 60@xmath2 , 60 - 70@xmath2 and 70 - 80@xmath2 centralities .",
    "there are five such values , @xmath5 = 1.58 , 1.59 , 1.60 , 1.61 and 1.68 .",
    "however , only @xmath70 is chosen to be the best scaling parameter , as it gives the smallest @xmath71 , which means the deviation of the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) from unity is the minimum .",
    "this @xmath5 value is larger than the scaling parameter ( @xmath37 ) utilized in the geometrical scaling of the inclusive charged hadron @xmath1 spectra in @xmath15 collisions at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to see that the effective scaling parameter @xmath72 ( 0.091 ) in pb - pb collisions is very close to @xmath73 ( 0.108 ) in @xmath15 collisions .    the number of data points which exhibit geometrical scaling as a function of @xmath5 in the inclusive charged hadron @xmath1 spectra at pb - pb 5 - 10@xmath2 , 10 - 20@xmath2 , 20 - 30@xmath2 , 30 - 40@xmath2 , 40 - 50@xmath2 , 50 - 60@xmath2 , 60 - 70@xmath2 and 70 - 80@xmath2 collisions . ]",
    "now since @xmath70 , we can figure out @xmath74 , @xmath59 , @xmath75 , @xmath63 , @xmath67 , @xmath62 and @xmath66 for the 5 - 10@xmath2 , 10 - 20@xmath2 , 20 - 30@xmath2 , 30 - 40@xmath2 , 40 - 50@xmath2 , 50 - 60@xmath2 , 60 - 70@xmath2 and 70 - 80@xmath2 centralities .",

    "we observe that the number of data points which present geometrical scaling increase with centrality . for the 5 - 10@xmath2 centrality class ,",
    "all the data points show geometrical scaling , while for the 70 - 80@xmath2 centrality class , only 18 out of 61 data points exhibit geometrical scaling . as a consequence ,",
