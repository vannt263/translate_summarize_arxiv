    "the okounkov body of a divisor encodes asymptotic invariants of the divisor s linear system , and it is determined solely by the divisor s numerical equivalence class .",
    "moreover , these bodies vary as fibers of a linear map defined on a closed convex cone as one moves in the space of numerical equivalence classes of divisors on the variety . as a consequence",
    ", one can expect to obtain results about line bundles by applying methods from convex geometry to the study of these okounkov bodies .",

    "the explicit description of okounkov bodies in concrete examples can be rather difficult .",
    "one easy case is that of smooth projective toric varieties . if @xmath13 is an invariant divisor on such a variety , and",

    "such vector bundles were described by a. klyachko in @xcite in terms of certain filtrations of a suitable vector space , and they have been the focus of some recent activity , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . as we will see , these filtrations can be used to compute the sections of all line bundles on @xmath1 . for our main result ,",
    "we restrict to the case of rank two toric vector bundles , where the klyachko filtrations are considerably simpler . using the data from the filtrations , we construct a flag of torus invariant subvarieties on @xmath1 and produce finitely many linear inequalities defining the global okounkov body of @xmath1 with respect to this flag . in particular , we see that this is a rational polyhedral cone . as an application",

    "this allows us to compute the global sections of any line bundle on @xmath1 , a fact of independent interest . the main point in the description of okounkov bodies",
    "is the computation of the vanishing orders of all sections of certain line bundles along the subvarieties in a fixed flag . in  [ section.vanishing.orders ]",
    "we construct a flag of invariant subvarieties @xmath29 in @xmath1 , and show that in this setting it is enough to compute the vanishing orders of a special collection of isotypical sections with respect to the torus action .",
