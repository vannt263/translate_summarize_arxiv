    "as is well known , deformation theory of modules is closely related to the lie algebra cohomology ( @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , given a lie algebra @xmath30 and a @xmath30-module @xmath31 the _ infinitesimal _ deformations of the @xmath32-module structure on @xmath33 , i.e. , deformations that are linear in the parameter of deformation , are described by the elements ( up to proportionality ) of @xmath34 .",
    "the obstructions to extension of any infinitesimal deformation to a formal one are similarly described by @xmath35 .",
    "computation of @xmath36 in our situation ( with @xmath10 and @xmath29 instead of @xmath37 ) was carried out by feigin and fuchs @xcite .",
    "ovsienko and i computed the corresponding @xmath5-relative cohomology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "gordan s classification of bilinear differential operators on weighted densities @xcite played a central role in our computation .",
    "later , a generalization to multi - dimensional manifolds has been carried out by lecomte and ovsienko in @xcite ; for further results , see @xcite . note that the @xmath5-relative cohomology measures infinitesimal deformations that become trivial once the action is restricted to @xmath11 this is actually the case for the space of differential operators since , as @xmath5-module , it is isomorphic to the space of symbols for generic @xmath13 and @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "let @xmath7 be the differential cohomology ( i.e. , we consider only cochains that are given by differential operators ) .",
    "recently i realized that a description of ( here @xmath39 is the lie algebra of polynomial vector fields ) @xmath40 can be deduced from the work by feigin and fuchs @xcite .",
    "feigin - fuchs gave details of computation of @xmath41 but not of higher cohomology and no explicit 2-cocycles were provided .",
    "the @xmath5-relative cohomology can not , however , be deduced from their computation .",
    "several authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have also studied @xmath42 for an arbitrary @xmath0-module @xmath43 but it is not easy to get a description of the cohomology ( [ intr ] ) nor the @xmath5-relative cohomology from their results . our main result is computation of the @xmath5-relative cohomology and explicit expressions of 2-cocycles that span ( [ intr ] ) .",
    "this work is the first step towards the study of formal deformations of symbols .    for investigation of all deformations of symbols in case of @xmath44 for @xmath45 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the authors use the neijenhuis - richardson product to prove the existence of cocycles but do not compute any cohomology .",
    "the cohomology similar to ( [ intr ] ) with @xmath44 instead of @xmath1 is still out of reach for @xmath45 .",
    "consider the standard ( local ) action of @xmath46 on @xmath1 by linear - fractional transformations .",
    "although the action is local , it generates global vector fields @xmath47 that form a lie subalgebra of @xmath0 isomorphic to the lie algebra @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "this realization of @xmath5 is understood throughout this paper .",
    "we need to introduce the following cocycle ( of gelfand - fuchs ) : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is a cohomology class in @xmath50 related is the element of @xmath51 the 2-cocycle on @xmath52 given by the formula ( see @xcite ) : @xmath53 this 2-cocycle generates the central extension of @xmath54 called the _ virasoro _ algebra .",
    "the following steps to compute the relative cohomology has intensively been used in @xcite .",
    "first , we classify @xmath5-invariant differential operators , then we isolate among them those that are 2-cocycles .",
    "to do that , we need the following lemma .",
    "[ har ] any 2-cocycle vanishing on the lie subalgebra @xmath5 of @xmath0 is @xmath5-invariant .",
    "the 2-cocycle condition reads as follows : @xmath56,z,\\phi\\,dx^\\lambda)-l_x^{\\lambda,\\mu}\\,c(y , z,\\phi\\,dx^\\lambda ) + \\circlearrowleft ( x , y , z)=0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] for every @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the summands obtained from the two written ones by the cyclic permutation of the symbols @xmath60 .",
    "now , if @xmath61 then the equation above becomes @xmath62,z,\\phi\\,dx^\\lambda)- c([x , z],y,\\phi\\,dx^\\lambda)=l_x^{\\lambda,\\mu}\\,c(y , z,\\phi\\,dx^\\lambda).\\ ] ] this condition is nothing but the invariance property .",
    "as our 2-cocycles vanish on @xmath63 we will investigate @xmath5-invariant bilinear differential operators that vanish on @xmath11    [ gh ] the space of skew - symmetric bilinear differential operators @xmath64 which are @xmath5-invariant and vanish on @xmath63 is as follows :    1 .",
    "it is @xmath65-dimensional if @xmath66 and @xmath67 is odd .",
    "2 .   it is @xmath68-dimensional if @xmath66 and @xmath67 is even .",
    "it is @xmath19-dimensional , otherwise .",
    "the generic form of any such a differential operator is ( here @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 stands for @xmath74    the invariance property with respect to the vector field @xmath75 with arbitrary @xmath76 and @xmath77 implies that @xmath78 and @xmath79 therefore @xmath80 are constants .",
    "now , the invariance property with respect @xmath81 with arbitrary @xmath76 and @xmath77 is equivalent to the system ( where @xmath82 ) : @xmath83 for @xmath84 the equation ( [ par ] ) implies that all the constants @xmath85 can be determined _ uniquely _ in terms of @xmath86 and @xmath87 more precisely , @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 and from the system ( [ par ] ) , we have @xmath91 thus the constant @xmath92 is determined . but for @xmath89 and @xmath93 the system ( [ par ] ) implies that @xmath94 therefore all @xmath95 can be determined for any @xmath96    by continuing this procedure we see that @xmath97 can be determined as well as @xmath98 for @xmath99 even .",
