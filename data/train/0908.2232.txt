    "all observable information about a many - body quantum system is encoded in its correlation functions . for interacting systems in the thermodynamic limit this",
    "information is , in general , only accessible through various approximations . until rather recently very few examples were known , where correlation functions could be calculated exactly . among the known examples there was none with short - range interactions of finite and tunable strength . in particular , for the large and prototypical class of integrable models that are solvable by bethe ansatz , the solution was limited to the spectral properties , but except for what can be concluded from the finite size corrections to the spectrum rather little was known about their correlation functions .",
    "this situation is about to change .",
    "extensive studies by several groups , mainly focusing on the xxz quantum spin chain , have eventually uncovered a structure which we believe to be typical for the bethe ansatz solvable models : the one - point and the neighbour correlation functions determine everything .",
    "we call this phenomenon factorization . based on the factorization we can calculate for the first time short - range correlation functions with arbitrary accuracy , both , for finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , and for arbitrary finite length in the ground state @xcite .",
    "this has applications e.g.  in the determination of esr - line shifts @xcite and is useful for estimating the errors associated with standard numerical techniques like the quantum monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "factorization appeared first @xcite as the explicit factorization of certain multiple integrals @xcite describing the density matrix elements of the isotropic heisenberg chain in the ground state with no magnetic field applied .",
    "a similar factorization for the ground state correlation functions of the xxz chain in the massive regime , i.e.  for the model considered in this article , was carried out in @xcite .",
    "after a multiple integral representation for finite temperature correlation functions had become available @xcite , the factorization of the integrals for short distances was extended to this case @xcite . following the success with the direct factorization of the integrals a deep exploration into the algebraic structure of the static correlation functions of the xxz chain",
    "was conducted by boos , jimbo , miwa , smirnov and takeyama , culminating in the works @xcite , where the factorization of all static correlation functions of the xxz chain was proved in a very general setting , including the finite temperature and finite magnetic field cases .    in all the recent works cited above it was crucial not to deal directly with the spin chain hamiltonian , but with the associated six - vertex model @xcite .",
    "the six vertex model naturally carries inhomogeneity parameters in horizontal and vertical directions and can be distorted by a disorder field without loosing its distinctive feature , the integrability . in this setting the density matrix of a finite segment of the xxz chain is naturally generalized to include the inhomogeneity parameters and the strength @xmath6 of the disorder field .",
    "the vertical inhomogeneity parameters @xmath7 and the disorder field regularize the expression for the density matrix .",
    "the horizontal spectral parameters allow one to introduce the temperature into the model @xcite and to adjust the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the density matrix of the inhomogeneous six - vertex model with disorder field depends polynomially on only two complex functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are efficiently described in terms of the solutions of integral equations @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the coefficients of the polynomials is a purely algebraic problem .",
    "it is related to the construction of a special fermionic basis @xcite on the space of local operators acting on the space of states of the spin chain .",
    "we call this the algebraic part of the problem and the calculation of the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 the physical part of the problem , since all dependence on the physical parameters , like temperature magnetic field or boundary conditions , is in these two functions .    for the time being no efficient algorithm for the algebraic part of the problem is known .",
    "this limits the range of the correlation functions we are actually able to calculate to a few lattice sites . in @xcite",
    "we calculated the coefficients for the two - point functions for up to four lattice site by brute force computer algebra .",
    "then we solved the physical part of the problem in the massless regime . at a late stage of the calculation the homogeneous limit and the limit of vanishing disorder field had to be taken in order to obtain the correlation functions of the spin chain . due to the singular nature of this limit",
    "the first derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath6 and various derivatives with respect to the inhomogeneity parameters appear .",
    "the final expressions are polynomials in three functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( basically the @xmath6 derivative of @xmath11 ) and @xmath10 and their derivatives .",
    "the coefficients in these polynomials are rational functions in the deformation parameter @xmath13 , which determines the anisotropy of the xxz chain , and are algebraic and universal .",
    "therefore the expressions derived in @xcite for the two - point functions in the massless regime also apply in the massive regime , if one replaces the physical part , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 appropriately .",
    "this is the main subject of this work .",
    "we reformulate the expressions for the functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 originally obtained in @xcite in a way that is convenient for numerical calculations in the massive regime @xmath14 of the xxz chain . combining this with the general formulae and the numerical results from @xcite we obtain accurate data for the two - point functions in the full parameter plane of the infinite antiferromagnetic chain ( anisotropy @xmath15 and magnetic field @xmath2 arbitrary ) .",
    "they exhibit a surprisingly rich non - monotonic behaviour .",
    "we should comment on the level of mathematical rigour of our results .",
    "in @xcite we conjectured the physical part of the problem as well as the contribution to the algebraic part connected with the one - point functions in the limit , when @xmath16 .",
    "meanwhile we know @xcite the exact physical part even for finite @xmath6 and we could show @xcite that it reproduces our conjecture for @xmath16 .",
    "the algebraic part for distances up to four lattice sites was checked in @xcite by several independent means ( comparison with the high temperature expansion of the multiple integrals @xcite , direct numerical computation , consideration of various limits ) .",
    "now , as we may infer from @xcite , it is clear that the exponential formula of @xcite is valid for arbitrary distances and zero magnetic field and at least for the distance of two lattice sites at finite magnetic field . on the other hand , the work @xcite offers a future way for the rigorous calculation of the algebraic part which needs no exponential form of the density matrix and will hopefully lead to the calculation of static correlation functions for points at larger distances .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath17 of the xxz chain in the massive antiferromagnetic regime ( @xmath18 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 , act locally as pauli matrices , @xmath20 is the anisotropy parameter and @xmath21 the exchange coupling .",
    "the xxz hamiltonian preserves the @xmath22-component of the total spin @xmath23 thus , the magnetization in @xmath22-direction is a thermodynamic quantity , and the thermal equilibrium of the finite system is characterized by the statistical operator @xmath24 depending on the temperature @xmath25 and the external magnetic field @xmath2 .    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 the system severely simplifies , since ,",
    "from the six - vertex model point of view , a single eigenstate of the so - called quantum transfer matrix determines the state of thermodynamic equilibrium and hence all static correlation functions @xcite .",
    "clearly the naive limit @xmath27 makes no sense in ( [ defrhon ] ) . to perform this limit in a sensible way we fix integers @xmath28 with @xmath29 and",

    "the functional @xmath42 allows for a generalization within the framework of the six - vertex model with disorder field . in the seminal paper @xcite",
    "this generalization was denoted @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 referring to the magnetic field in certain units ) .",
    "it is this functional which depends on only two functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 and which clearly separates the physical and the algebraic part of the problem . for details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    in this work we are dealing with applications .",
    "we shall only need an understanding of the general idea of factorization and the concrete formula obtained in @xcite .",
    "for this reason we refrain in the following from any sophisticated mathematical notation and simply write @xmath46 for thermal expectation values on the infinite chain .",
    "as explained in @xcite the limit @xmath16 leads to three functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 that determine the correlation functions of the xxz chain .",
    "a relatively simple description of these functions in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath50 and a generalized magnetization density @xmath51 was given in @xcite .",
    "we call it the @xmath50-formulation .",
    "the @xmath50-formulation is useful for deriving multiple integral formulae @xcite and for studying the high - temperature expansion of the free energy and the correlation functions @xcite .",
    "it allows for a rather uniform description of the massless and the massive xxz chain , the only difference between the two cases being a different choice for the so - called canonical integration contour in the complex plane @xcite .    for numerical calculations of thermodynamic properties",
    "@xcite or short - distance correlators from the multiple integral @xcite one has to change to a different formulation we refer to as the @xmath52-formulation .",
    "it needs pairs of functions , but the defining integral equations involve only straight contours .",
    "it is here where one has to distinguish between the massless and the massive case , when it comes to numerical calculations .",
    "two separate computer programs are needed .",
    "in @xcite we studied the massless case .",
    "here we proceed to the massive case .",
    "we start from the @xmath50-formulation of the physical part proposed in @xcite and switch to the @xmath52-formulation .",
    "this is a standard procedure which ( in the massive case ) basically requires the application of fourier series and the convolution theorem .",
    "as far as the integral equations are concerned the reader may e.g.  refer to @xcite .",
    "then it is rather obvious how to proceed in a similar way with the expressions for the functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( equations ( 15 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 20 ) for @xmath53 in @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we just state the results .",

    ", however , we observe large deviations from the low - temperature ising curves .",
    "this behaviour is induced by a critical point at @xmath163 , @xmath162 in the zero temperature phase diagram of the xxz chain ( see figure [ fig : phasendiagramm_ising ] ) which separates regions of different asymptotics for the two - point correlation functions of the ising chain . the latter fact is most easily understood by inspection of the @xmath141 transfer matrix of the ising chain @xcite , @xmath164 its eigenvalues @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) and",
    "eigenvectors @xmath167 determine the partition function of the ising chain as well as its two - point functions .",
    "in fact , when we wrote , we used the formula @xcite @xmath168 and the explicit expression for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath169 , which the reader may easily calculate from ( [ tising ] ) . in order to understand the different zero temperature behaviour of the ising correlation functions it suffices to consider the low temperature asymptotics of the transfer matrix . using ( [ tising ] ) , ( [ isinggenform ] )",

    "this degeneracy is lifted by residual quantum mechanical interactions causing algebraically decaying correlations .",

    "this can be seen in the left panel in figure [ fig : ising ] for @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 . however , as the width of the critical phase gets smaller with increasing @xmath5 , one can find for each magnetic field , except for the critical field , a sufficiently large @xmath5 such that for larger anisotropies the correlation functions behave as in the ising model .    for @xmath177",

    "interestingly in this case the zero temperature limit does not depend on the ( finite ) value of @xmath5 .",
    "this is a general behaviour as we observe that the correlation functions are asymptotically constant on straight lines ending in the ising critical point .",
    "we can see this exemplarily in the right panel of figure [ fig : ising ] , where the connected correlation functions show the same zero temperature asymptotics for three different pairs of values of the anisotropy and the magnetic field .    comparing these curves with those for the ising model with the same magnetic fields , we identify four different temperature regimes .",
    "for very high temperatures the curves are independent of @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "then , for intermediate temperatures , they are independent of the ( large ) anisotropy and only depend on the magnetic field .",
    "this is where the curves for finite @xmath5 and the curves of the ising model match .",
    "next comes an regime where the correlation functions depend on the anisotropy and the magnetic field , and finally , for very low temperatures , only the product @xmath178 determines the correlation functions .",
    "in fact , this is a rare example , where the full low temperature asymptotics of thermodynamic quantities and short - range correlation functions in the vicinity of a critical point can be worked out analytically @xcite .     for large values of the anisotropy , fixed @xmath173 and different values of @xmath179 .",

    "another limit , which is interesting from a technical point of view , is the paramagnet @xmath181 . at a first glance",
    "it might look rather trivial . yet , as the coefficients in section [ sec : examples ] depend on @xmath182 , the functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 depend on @xmath182 as well , but the final result must not . in this sense",
