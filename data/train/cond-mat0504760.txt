    "one of the first band structure methods formulated in terms of green s functions is the kkr method of koringa , kohn and rostoker @xcite . although it is not counted among the fastest band structure methods , it is usually regarded as a very accurate technique .",
    "the advantage of the kkr method lies in the transparent multiple scattering formalism which allows to express the green s function in terms of single - site scattering and geometrical or structural quantities .",
    "a second outstanding feature of the kkr method is the dyson equation relating the green s function of a perturbed system with the green s function of the corresponding unperturbed reference system . because of this property , the kkr green s function method allows to deal with substitutional disorder including both diluted impurities and concentrated alloys in the framework of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite . within this approach ( kkr - cpa )",
    "the propagation of an electron in an alloy is regarded as a succession of elementary scattering processes due to random atomic scatterers , with an average taken over all configurations of the atoms .",
    "this problem can be solved assuming that a given scattering center is embedded in an effective medium whose choice is open and can be made in a self - consistent way .",
    "the physical condition corresponding to the cpa is simply that a single scatterer embedded in the effective cpa medium should produce no further scattering on the average .",
    "a similar philosophy is applied also when dealing with many - body problems for crystals in the framework of the so called dynamical mean field theory ( dmft , for review see ref . ) .",
    "thus it seems to be rather natural to combine the dmft and kkr methods to arrive at a very reliable and flexible band structure scheme that include correlation effects beyond the standard local density ( lda ) or generalized ( gga ) approximations .",
    "in fact the combination of the kkr - cpa for disordered alloys and the dmft scheme is based on the same arguments as used by drchal et al.@xcite when combining the tb - lmto green s function method for alloys @xcite with the dmft .",
    "in contrast to their approach , however , the formalism presented below allows to incorporate correlation effects via a corresponding self - energy when calculating the electronic single - site wave functions .",
    "first attempts to achieve a self - consistent description of local correlation effects in crystals have been made already many years ago . in the third paper of a famous series hubbard",
    "@xcite has introduced an alloy analogy and by an appropriate decoupling scheme for the green s function a set of equations has been derived that represent a self - consistent formulation equivalent to the cpa approximation .",
    "in contrast to the dmft the `` hubbard iii '' approximation considers quantum on - site fluctuations as static ones which leads to some shortcomings such as violation of some fermi liquid properties , missing of the so called kondo peak near the metal - insulator transition @xcite . keeping in mind the above conceptual analogies",
    "it is our purpose to present here a combined local density approximation and dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) electronic structure technique , including the case of disordered solids , in the framework of the kkr method .",
    "the many - body correlation effects are treated by means of the dmft , while the disorder is described in the framework of the cpa .",
    "taking into account the local nature of the dmft approximation the self - energy is represented by a local complex energy dependent quantity ( which is a matrix in orbital indices ) viewed as a contribution to the electronic potential .",
    "we note that for a general non - local energy dependent potential multiple scattering theory offers a solution known as the optical potential @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlocal self - energy is far too complicated to be used in a realistic computation .    very recently",
    "a combined lda+dmft computational scheme was proposed in which the so called exact muffin - tin band structure method was used . in the emto approach",
    "@xcite the one - electron effective potential is represented by the optimized overlapping muffin - tin potential which is considered as the best possible spherical approximation to the full - one electron potential .",
    "in essence the one - electron green s function is evaluated on a complex contour similarly to the screened kkr technique , from which it was derived . in the iteration procedure the lda+dmft green s function",
    "is used to calculate the charge and spin densities . finally , for the charge self - consistent calculation one constructs the new lda effective potential from the spin and charge densities @xcite , using the poisson equation in the spherical cell approximation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the emto implementation @xcite , the present work follows a natural development in which the self - energy is added directly to the coupled radial differential equations which determine the electronic wave function within a potential well and this way the single - site @xmath0-matrix .",
    "because this way also the scattering path operator of multiple scattering theory used to set up the electronic green s function is determined unambiguously , no further approximations are needed to achieve charge self - consistency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ forprob ] presents a general formulation of the problem .",
    "section [ msgf ] provides an extension of the derivation of the multiple scattering green s function to include the self - energy , and in particular provides the information on the many - body solver .",
    "section [ aim ] describes the many - body solver used in our calculation , that is based on a modified fluctuating exchange interaction approximation .",
    "the combined self - consistency cycle is presented in section [ slfcns ] .",
    "finally , results and discussions are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "the dmft method has already been implemented within several band structure methods based on a wave function formalism : first in the linear muffin - tin orbital method in atomic sphere approximation ( asa - lmto ) @xcite and then in full - potential lmto @xcite , as well as in a screened kkr or exact muffin - tin orbitals approach ( emto)@xcite .",
    "the emerged lda+dmft method can be used for calculating the electronic structure for a large variety of systems with different strength of the electronic correlations ( for a review , see refs . ) . to underline the importance of complete lda+dmft self - consistency we mention that the first successful attempt to combine the dmft with lda charge self - consistency gave an important insight into a long - standing problem of phase diagram and localization in f - electron systems @xcite and has been used also to describe correlation effects in half - metallic ferromagnetic materials like nimnsb @xcite . as an alternative to the above mentioned band structure methods ,",
    "accurate self - consistent methods for solving the local kohn - sham equations based on lda in terms of green s functions have been developed within the multiple scattering theory ( kkr - method ) @xcite .",
    "for that reason the kkr - method can be combined , as it will be shown below , in a natural way with the lda+dmft approach .",
    "a further appealing feature of this scheme is that the cpa alloy theory can also be incorporated very easily .    in order to account within lda - band structure calculations for correlations",
    "an improved hybrid hamiltonian was proposed by anisimov et al.@xcite . in its most general form",
    "such a hamiltonian is written as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 stands for the ordinary lda hamiltonian , @xmath5 describes the effective electron - electron interaction and the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath6 serves to eliminate double counting of the interactions already accounted for by @xmath4 .    using second quantization a rather general expression for @xmath5",
    "is given by :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 runs over all the sites of the crystal @xmath9 and the creation ( @xmath10 ) and annihilation ( @xmath11 ) operators are defined with respect to some subset of localized orbitals @xmath12 .",
    "the constants @xmath13 are matrix elements of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath14 : @xmath15 the resulting many - particle hamiltonian can not be diagonalized exactly , thus various methods were developed in the past to find an approximate solution @xcite . among them",
    "one of the most promising approaches is to solve eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) within dynamical mean field theory , a method developed originally to deal with the hubbard model .",
    "the main idea of dmft is to map a periodic many - body problem onto an effective single - impurity problem that has to be solved self - consistently . for this purpose",
    "one describes the electronic properties of the system in terms of the one particle green s function @xmath16 , being the solution of the equation :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the complex energy and the effective self - energy operator @xmath19 is assumed to be a single - site quantity for site @xmath8 :    @xmath20    within dmft , the self - energy matrix @xmath21 is a solution of the many - body problem of an impurity placed in an effective medium .",
    "this medium is described by the so called _ bath _ green s function matrix @xmath22 defined as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is calculated as a projection of @xmath16 onto the impurity site : @xmath25    as the self - energy @xmath21 depends on the _ bath _ green s function @xmath26 the dmft equations have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "accordingly , from a technical point of view the problem can be split into two parts .",
    "one is dealing with the solution of eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) and the second one is the effective many - body problem to find the self - energy @xmath21 . within the present work ,",
    "the first task is solved by the kkr band structure method , as described below in sec .",
