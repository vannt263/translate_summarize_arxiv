    "now there are some observations that are in good agreement with this molecular cloud - like scenario , like the emitting and absorbing features observed in some x - ray afterglows ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the detection of a large amount of dust obtained from the high resolution spectroscopy of three optical afterglows @xcite and the high rest frame visual extinction inferred in some other optical afterglows ( e.g.@xcite ) . under this point of view",
    ", the non detection of @xmath2 of x - ray afterglows at optical wavelengths ( dark grb ) would be due to the dust absorption .",
    "on the other hand , the spectral energy distribution of some grb afterglows indicates that dust reddening is very slow ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , for the observed optical afterglows , on average , the estimated rest frame visual extinction is a factor 10 - 100 lower than the expected if an ism with dust to gas ratio and an extinction curve similar to the galactic one are assumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , some high redshift burst showed a larger amount of gas than dust . in a recent work , stratta et al.(@xcite ) already pointed out that absorption properties derived from x - ray and optical afterglows spectral analysis may require a `` non - standard '' extinction .",
    "a more careful study is required to probe the ism of grb environment .",
    "+ in this work we present the results of a systematic multiwavelenght spectra analysis of a sample of grb afterglows in order to put some constraints on the properties of the circumburst environment .",

    "standard data reduction in the 0.1 - 10.0 kev energy range was performed using sas 6.0 for the data of the xmm - newton epic instrument and using ciao 2.3 for the chandra acis - s instrument .",
    "all the spectra were analyzed with xspec 11.2.0 . in order to get gaussian statistics ,",
    "thus so to ensure the applicability of the @xmath8 test to evaluate the goodness of our fits , the spectra were rebinned to obtain at least 20 counts per energy channel . for the epic spectra we performed simultaneous pn , mos1 and mos2 spectral fitting .      according to the standard fireball model , the spectrum of the x - ray afterglows emission",
    "is well described by a simple power law @xmath9 . in this analysis we adopted a spectral model that takes into account",

    "the redshift values are derived from optical observation when available ; otherwise , the value z=1 was adopted , being this the peak value of grb redshift distribution@xcite .",
    "we found an absorption larger than the galactic value in nine cases ( grb000210,grb001025 , grb020322 , grb020405 , grb020813 , grb030226 , + grb030227 , grb031203 , grb040223 ) with confidence level up to 4@xmath13 .",

    "for the eight afterglows of the sample with an optical counterpart ( see tab[campione ] ) the analysis was extended to the optical and nir band , in order to better constrain extinction properties through a fit of spectra as wide as possible .",
    "photometric data have been taken from literature . to perform this large band analysis we applied some correction to data .",
    "firstly , being @xmath17 we extrapolated magnitudes at the same time of x - ray observation , adopting the measured optical - nir decay index published in literature and then we corrected them from galactic extinction along grb line of sight using the iras 100 m@xmath18 e(b - v ) maps by schlegel et al .",

    "finally , the magnitudes have been converted in fluxes using the effective wavelenghts and normalization fluxes given by fukugita et al .",
    "1995 @xcite .      for the optical / nir data we adopted a model composed by a powerlaw and an absorption component that takes into account the dust extinction : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the visual extinction",
    "assuming the slow cooling regime as the most probable one for the electron population at the observation time , we assumed that the electron index p is twice the x - ray spectral index previously obtained within @xmath22 confidence level .",
    "we fitted the data using both the possibility predicted for this regime : @xmath23 if @xmath24 , @xmath25 if @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the cooling frequency .",
    "we tested different dust composition and dust - to - gas ratio using different extinction curves , assuming that the dust grains distribution @xmath28 is described by a simple power law @xmath29 .",

    "we have also tested an extinction curve ( c ) derived by calzetti et al .",

    "for all this different ism model the rest frame visual extinction has been estimated for all the afterglows sample .      for grb991216 and grb011211",
    "we have obtained only the galactic contribution to extinction , a result consistent with the previously x - ray analysis .",

    "we also compared the best fit additional @xmath15 density at grb s redshift with the best fit @xmath35 obtained for the different extinction curves .",
    "the @xmath36 relations have been compared with the corresponding theoretical one : galactic , @xmath37 @xcite ; small magellanic cloud , @xmath38 @xcite ; q1 , @xmath39 and q2 , @xmath40 @xcite . for the starburst galaxies",
    "no @xmath36 relationship has been derived due the complexity of this kind of ism . assuming a galactic - like and smc ism , this ratio are well above the expected values , confirming previous studies ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) . a good agreement is obtained with an ism with dust grain size distribution skewed toward large grain ( see fig .",
    "[ results2 ] ) .",
    "such a dust composition reconciles the typical low reddening observed in the optical afterglows seds with the high amount of dust observed through optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this kind of environment can be obtained in two ways : small dust grain can coagulate into larger producing a dust distribution biased towards larger grains as expected in high density medium ( e.g.@xcite ) , or the physical state of the gas and dust are modified by the intense x - ray and uv emission from grb , ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "+ such an uncertainty will be solved by monitoring the very early afterglows and the possible evolution of the extinction effects .",
    "the swift satellite and robotic telescopes , such as rem , will be very useful to provide us these informations ."
