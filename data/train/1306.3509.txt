    "the number of known transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) is rapidly increasing , and currently stands at 310 .",
    "their diversity is also escalating : the radius of the largest known example is 40 times greater than that of the smallest .",
    "there is a variation of over three orders of magnitude in their masses , excluding those without mass measurements and those which are arguably brown dwarfs .",
    "whilst a small subset of this population has been extensively investigated , the characterisation of the majority is limited to modest photometry and spectroscopy presented in their discovery papers .",
    "the bottleneck in our understanding of the physical properties of most teps is the quality of the available transit light curves , which are of fundamental importance for measuring the stellar density and the ratio of the radius of the planet to that of the star .",
    "additional contributions , which arise from the spectroscopic parameters of the host star and the constraints on its physical properties from theoretical models , are usually dwarfed by the uncertainties in the photometric parameters derived from the light curves .",
    "we are therefore undertaking a project aimed at characterising teps visible from the southern hemisphere ( see @xcite and references therein ) , by obtaining high - precision light curves of their transits .",
    "we use the telescope defocussing technique , discussed in detail in @xcite , to collect photometric measurements with very low levels of poisson and correlated noise .",
    "this method is able to achieve light curves of remarkable precision ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we present new observations and determinations of the physical properties of wasp-15 and wasp-16 , based on nine light curves covering six transits in total .",
    "[ sec : intro : history ]      wasp-15 was identified as a tep by @xcite , who found it to be a low - density object ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) orbiting a slightly evolved and comparatively hot host star ( @xmath2k ) .",
    "other measurements of the effective temperature of the host star have been made by @xcite , who found @xmath3k from the infrared flux method @xcite , and by @xcite , whose detailed spectroscopic analysis yielded @xmath4k .",
    "@xcite observed the rossiter - mclaughlin effect for wasp-15 and found the system to exhibit significant obliquity : the sky - projected angle between the rotational axis of the host star and the orbital axis of the planet is @xmath5degrees .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings that misaligned planets are found only around hotter stars @xcite , although tidal effects act to align them over time @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the planetary nature of wasp-16 was made by @xcite , who characterised it as a jupiter - like planet orbiting a star similar to our sun . @xcite and",
    "@xcite measured the host star s",
    "@xmath6  to be @xmath7k and @xmath8k , respectively , in mutual agreement and a little cooler than the value of @xmath9k found in the discovery paper .",
    "observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect for wasp-16 have yielded obliquities consistent with zero : @xcite measured @xmath10degrees and @xcite found @xmath11degrees .",
    "the large uncertainties in these assessments are due to the low rotational velocity of the star , which results in a small amplitude for the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "the physical properties of both systems were comparatively ill - defined , as they rested on few dedicated follow - up light curves : only one light curve in the case of wasp-16 , and two datasets afflicted with correlated noise in the case of wasp-15 .",
    "all three datasets were obtained using eulercam on the 1.2 m swiss euler telescope at eso la silla . in this work",
    "we present the first follow - up photometry since the discovery paper for both systems , totalling nine new light curves covering six transits . this new material has allowed us to significantly improve the precision of the measured physical properties .",
    "our analysis also benefited from refined constraints on the atmospheric characteristics of the host stars , as discussed above .",
