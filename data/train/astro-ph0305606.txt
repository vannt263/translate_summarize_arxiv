    "the wmap experiment is currently observing the microwave sky at five different frequency channels with different angular resolution @xcite .",
    "the low frequency bands , k , ka & q , measuring at 23 , 33 & 41ghz respectively , are expected to be particularly sensitive to the free - free and synchrotron emission in the milky way . although their angular resolution is not as good as in the high frequency channels , their measurements of the foreground contamination are critical in order to achieve an optimal subtraction of non - cosmological signal in the overall analysis .",
    "this analysis has yielded the identification of two main components in the sky signal : a cosmological component , which constrains crucial cosmological parameters such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 with unprecedented accuracy @xcite , and a foreground - induced component , whose impact in the high frequency channels ( v ( 61ghz ) & w(94ghz ) ) is modelled by means of the low frequency measurements .",
    "these channels have been located in a frequency range where the contribution from foregrounds is expected to be minimal @xcite , and their high angular resolution ( up to @xmath7 ) enables the study the sub - horizon structure of the last scattering surface .    however , it is also expected that the presence of large scale structure intersecting the geodesics of the cmb photons leave a signature in the form of _ secondary _ temperature anisotropies . among these temperature fluctuations ,",
    "the most important ( in terms of amplitude ) are those caused by the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , ( isw ) , due to the variation of the gravitational potential , and the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( hereafter tsz , @xcite ) , due to the distortion of the black body spectrum of cmb photons after interacting with a hot electron plasma .",
    "the search of tsz - induced signal in cmb data sets by comparing them with surveys of large scale structure has been performed for cobe data @xcite , and tenerife data @xcite .",
    "they all failed to measure any significant correlation , and hence could only set upper limits to the comptonization parameter @xmath8 .    in this context , three recent analyses have been carried out on wmap data .",
    "this first one has been carried out by the wmap team : a cross - correlation of the w - band with the xbacs catalog of 242 abell - type clusters @xcite has prompted a detection at 2.5@xmath0 level . however , a direct cross - correlation of wmap data with rosat @xcite has given negative results . in this analysis , the difference map between v and w bands was compared to the rosat map by the study of the power spectrum of the product map and the cross - power spectrum of both maps . apart from an apparently spurious coincidence in the product map , there is no trace for any significant correlation .",
    "more recently , @xcite have reported a positive cross - correlation at the 23 sigma level between the wmap data and the x - ray heao-1 and radio nrao vla sky surveys .",
    "their study focuses on extra - galactic objects as tracers of the large scale structure , and the positive sign of their correlation would point to the isw effect as the responsible for this excess .",
    "a similar result was reported by @xcite after cross - correlating the v band of wmap with a template built from the apm galaxy survey .",
    "they find a positive cross correlation with a significance of @xmath9 .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the study of possible correlation of wmap data with large scale structure ( lss ) to cluster and supercluster scales . by using cluster surveys present in the literature , we construct template maps of lss , and cross",
    "correlate them with the temperature maps of wmap .",
    "although the angular resolution and the sensitivity of wmap are not ideal for the typical tsz amplitudes and angular profiles of clusters of galaxies , we expect that if a large enough number of them are indeed contributing to the map their final imprint should be statistically measurable . on the other hand ,",
    "angular sizes of superclusters of galaxies are resolved by the v & w bands of wmap , so they should allow to set constraints in the density and/or temperature of the diffuse gas thought to be present in those structures .",
    "in section 2 we outline the details of the statistical methods used in our analyses .",
    "section 3 describes the wmap data , whereas in section 4 we explain how our tsz templates of clusters and supercluster of galaxies were synthesised .",
    "finally , in section 5 we show our results , which we discuss in section 6 .",
    "in this section we describe the statistical tools used to search for signature of large scale structure in wmap cmb maps in the form of tsz effect .",
    "all our statistics will be defined in the real space , and will be restricted to those regions where we expect a high contribution from sz sources . by doing this , we are trying to minimise the effects related to the limited angular resolution and sensitivity of wmap in terms of typical sz amplitudes . a fourier analysis in a selected and non - continuous sample of pixels can not always be defined in a simple way and will be discarded here .",
    "core radii of clusters of galaxies usually subtend an angle of @xmath10 in the sky , which is considerably smaller than the fwhm of the highest resolution channel ( 94ghz ) of wmap , ( @xmath11 arcmins ) . for this reason , from the five bands of wmap , we shall only use this channel when searching for cluster induced signal in the wmap data , as we expect that other channels will dilute the sz signal to a much greater extent .",
    "the high resolution map of tegmark , de oliveira - costa & hamilton ( 2003 ) , which combines all bands but preserves the angular resolution of the 94ghz channel , will also be considered .",
    "however , for superclusters of galaxies , the situation differs considerably , provided the fact that these sources can have a size of a few degrees on the sky , enabling the use of lower frequency channels of wmap . + the two statistical methods used in this paper",
    "will search for similarities present in both our templates and the wmap cmb maps .",
    "the first method ( method _ i _ ) consists of a pixel - to - pixel comparison of cmb maps to the templates . given the cmb and noise amplitudes in those pixels ,",
    "we estimate what is the fraction of signal present in cmb maps which is correlated to the structure of our catalogues . in the second method , ( method _ ii _ )",
    "we computed the cross - correlation function between our templates and the wmap map(s ) , and compared it to the auto - correlation function computed in our synthesised maps .",
    "we shall assume that the wmap data can be modelled as the following sum of components : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the cmb , @xmath14 the noise , and @xmath15 is the sz induced signal modelled by our templates , which enters into the map with an average amplitude given by @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the _ ith _ foreground component .",
    "this last term will introduce a bias in our statistics , and its impact in our results must be considered",
    ". there might be as well some offset due to the inaccurate setting of the zero level in the wmap maps . from figure",
    "( 7 ) in @xcite one would expect a typical error of a few ( @xmath18 ) microkelvin .",
    "the impact of such offsets will be addressed when quoting our results .",
    "+ * method _ i ) _ : * + we shall minimise the statistic @xmath19 given by    @xmath20    in terms of @xmath16 . by doing this , our estimate of @xmath16 will be equal to : @xmath21 = \\frac { { \\mbox{\\bf { t}}}{\\cal c}^{-1 } { \\mbox{\\bf { m}}}^t } { { \\mbox{\\bf { m}}}{\\cal c}^{-1 } { \\mbox{\\bf { m}}}^t } \\label{eq : alpha1}\\ ] ] in both equations [ eq : chi1 ] and [ eq : alpha1 ] , @xmath22 denotes the correlation function of the sz - free temperature map , i.e. : @xmath23 in our analyses , we considered only cmb and noise when computing @xmath22 .",
    "the cosmological signal was modelled by using the cmb power spectrum measured by the wmap team @xcite , whereas the noise component was introduced using the amplitudes at each pixel according to the scanning strategy of the wmap mission .",
    "the formal error for the estimated @xmath16 is given by : @xmath24    however , in these equations we have neglected the bias term introduced by the presence of any possible foreground component , ( i.e. synchrotron , free - free , dust or point sources ) .",
    "our basic assumption will be that foregrounds and tsz sources will introduce temperature fluctuations of opposite sign , positive and negative respectively , in the wmap cmb scans .",
    "we remark at this point that all wmap channels are in the rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) frequency range , for which the tsz distortions of the cmb planckian spectrum introduce _ negative _ temperature fluctuations . therefore , because of the presence of foreground residuals in wmap maps , the measured @xmath16 will be shifted to positive values , and we will only be able to establish lower limits to the presence of sz - induced signal in wmap scans , so our approach can be regarded as conservative . + * method _ ii ) _ : *   + we shall define the @xmath19 statistic in terms of the cross - correlation and auto - correlation functions computed from the wmap cmb map(s ) and our templates . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath19 in the form :    @xmath25\\ ] ] @xmath26 \\label{eq : chi2b}\\ ] ]    in this equation , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the cross and auto correlation function of our template maps with the wmap scans , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is the covariance matrix , defined as : @xmath30 @xmath31    the angle brackets denote ensemble averages after computing the cross - correlation between our templates and 100 monte - carlo realizations of the microwave sky accounting for the cmb signal and instrumental noise .",
    "the value of @xmath16 which minimises @xmath19 and its formal error are given by the following equations :    @xmath21 = \\frac{\\sum_{ij}c_{tm}(\\theta_i ) { \\mbox{\\bf $ \\pi$}}^{-1}_{ij }              c_{mm}(\\theta_j ) } { \\sum_{ij}c_{mm}(\\theta_i ) { \\mbox{\\bf $ \\pi$}}^{-1}_{ij }              c_{mm}(\\theta_j ) } \\label{eq : alpha2}\\ ] ]    @xmath32^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\label{eq : sgalpha2}\\ ] ]    this method assumes that all components which are not correlated to the template @xmath15 average to zero when computing the cross - correlation .",
    "foregrounds do not average to zero , and so they are supposed to bias the estimation of @xmath16 towards positive values .",
    "therefore , the impact of foregrounds in this analysis is quite similar to that in the previous method .",
    "we must also note that any mismatch in the zero level of the map would yield spurious correlation , so it is convenient to make alternative tests , such as repeating analyses after rotating the templates , to check whether any measured cross correlation is actually associated to our templates or not .",
    "we expect method _ ii _ to be particularly sensitive to the spatial structure of superclusters of galaxies .",
    "indeed , under wmap s 94 ghz beam , almost all clusters can be regarded as point - like , so we should expect @xmath33 for @xmath34 . however , superclusters of galaxies can subtend up to 40 degrees in the sky , and for them it might be possible to trace their typical angular extent by the study of @xmath35 . for these reasons , we shall use method _ i _ for the search of tsz signal in cluster scales , whereas method _ ii _ will be applied on supercluster templates .",
    "due to the typical size of superclusters ( few degrees ) , one can include in the analysis different bands of wmap , as we show in the following section .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to remark that , in terms of the frequency dependence of the tsz effect , the signal should drop around a 14% from channel v to channel w. +",
    "we have mentioned that , due to angular resolution requirements , initially we considered only the w band for our analyses with templates of clusters of galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of comparison , we included the map provided by tegmark , de oliveira - costa & hamilton ( 2003 ) , here denoted as t03 .",
    "this map weights the five bands of wmap according to their sensitivity at every angular scale .",
    "the result is a map with as much angular resolution as the w band and smaller presence of both noise and foreground contaminants .",
    "however , the properties of its noise component are complex . in our analyses",
    ", we characterised it in a optimistic and/or in a conservative way : either we assumed that the excess power of the map ( @xmath36k ) was due to gaussian white noise , or we simply assigned wmap s 94ghz band noise pattern to t03 .",
    "in order to assess the impact of foregrounds on our results , we performed our analyses using two different foreground masks : the kp0 mask and the kp2 mask , both provided by the wmap team .",
    "these masks remove from the analysis those pixels showing temperature fluctuations that trespass a given threshold computed from the histogram of the k - band data .",
    "the digit in the name of the mask is proportional to the threshold , so kp0 is twice as conservative / strict as kp2 . in these analyses ,",
    "the healpix resolution parameter was @xmath37512 .",
    "the relatively large typical size of superclusters allowed us to test the consistency of our results by including the v band in our analyses .",
    "furthermore , _ clean _ maps ( in the sense of foreground - free ) provided by the wmap team ( here denoted as _",
    "ilc _ for _ internal linear combination _ map ) and by tegmark , de oliveira - costa & hamilton ( 2003 ) were also considered .",
    "the _ ilc _ map has a typical angular resolution of one degree , whereas t03 has as much angular resolution as the w map .",
    "however , at low angular resolution , both maps are very similar , so we only retained t03 in our analyses .",
    "for our purposes of studying superclusters , the resolution of one degree suffices , so those temperature maps and all supercluster templates where pixelized under a coarser resolution , of a pixel size of @xmath38 .",
    "this angular degradation allowed us to speed the computation of the cross - correlation between the wmap temperature maps and our supercluster templates , and also made feasible to estimate the covariance matrices of equation ( [ eq : pi ] ) under a reasonable amount of time .",
    "we expect that the linear combination of different bands used to build the t03 map does not remove the tsz component of our maps , but leaves it in roughly the same amplitude level .",
    "our results will justify this hypothesis .",
    "one crucial step in our procedure will be constructing the templates from existing surveys of clusters and superclusters of galaxies , both in the optical and in the x - range band .",
    "we shall build only tsz templates , that is , in units of decrements of thermodynamic temperature .",
    "when cross - correlating with wmap temperature maps , a positive correlation would point to a detection of tsz effect . in any case , what matters is the spatial structure of our templates and not their overall normalisation .",
    "the conversion into thermodynamic temperature decrements from x - ray based catalogues will be performed by using existing relations between flux and/or luminosity in the x - ray band and antenna temperature decrements . for the optical catalogues",
    ", further assumptions will be necessary .    in the case of galaxy clusters",
    ", there is a fairly large sample of catalogues available , both in the x - range and in the optical . in the northern sky ,",
    "our analyses will first focus on two x - ray based catalogues of clusters of galaxies , i.e. , the northern _ rosat _ all sky galaxy ( noras ) cluster survey @xcite and the _ rosat _ brightest cluster sample ( bcs , @xcite ) .",
    "the source of these two catalogues is the published data of the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the noras cluster survey contains 495 sources with extended x - ray emission , of which 378 are unambiguously identified as clusters of galaxies . due to the modest completeness of this catalogue , ( count - rate limit of 0.06 counts / s )",
    ", we extend our analysis to the bcs catalogue , which is flux limited and shows a completeness of around 90% .",
    "this catalogue is built on two different cluster samples : the first sample @xcite listed 201 clusters of galaxies , whereas the extended sample @xcite provided 99 new objects .",
    "the criteria used in their construction are not purely x - ray based . both catalogues ( noras and bcs )",
    "give luminosities in the 0.12.4 kev energy band for every cluster , which will be converted into brightness temperature fluctuations , as it will be shown .",
    "in the southern hemisphere , @xcite extracted from the rass data a flux limited sample of 130 clusters of galaxies , with an estimated completeness of around 90 % .",
    "redshifts and fluxes in the 0.5  2 kev energy band are given for every object .",
    "analysing _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter pointings , @xcite compiled a catalogue of 203 serendipitously detected galaxy clusters .",
    "this catalogue , hereafter denoted by v98 , covers both hemispheres , and therefore complements all catalogues listed above .",
    "v98 provides redshifts and fluxes of members in the energy range of 0.5  2 kev .",
    "a conversion into luminosities will be necessary in order to estimate the antenna temperature fluctuations induced by these clusters .",
    "all catalogues listed so far rely on rosat data , and hence are all conditioned by the observation strategy of this experiment .    for the sake of comparison , we shall include in the analysis two more catalogues of galaxy clusters .",
    "these remaining two catalogues were built on the basis of existing optical galaxy cluster surveys , namely apm @xcite and aco @xcite .",
    "these catalogues provide an homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters in both hemispheres , and have been processed after applying selection criteria well different from those used in x - ray data analysis .",
    "however , unlike in the previous cases , these catalogues are not directly sensitive to the hot gas causing sz distortions , and assumptions will have to be made when relating optical properties of the sources ( i.e. richness ) with antenna temperature decrements .",
    "given the angular resolution of the w band , we note that we can safely ignore issues related to the gas distribution within cluster scales .    with respect to superclusters",
    ", we shall recur to the catalogues provided by @xcite .",
    "the use of these templates will be essential when testing the hypothesis of the presence of diffuse hot gas distributed in megaparsec scales .",
    ".sz cluster sample used to calibrate the template maps [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : rings ]",
    "we have used optical ( einasto , apm , aco ) and x - ray based ( bcs , noras , de grandi , v98 , vogues ) catalogues to locate in the sky tsz emitting sources as clusters and superclusters of galaxies . using scaling relations present in the literature , we have assigned microwave fluxes to our sources , and built tsz catalogues as they would be seen by the w band of wmap .",
    "we have cross correlated these catalogues with wmap using two different statistical approaches for clusters and superclusters . for the bcs , noras and de grandi cluster catalogues , we claim detections at the 2 - 5 @xmath0 level , ( except for degrandi , which gives no detection in the w band ) . in these cases",
    ", we have checked that most of the clusters ( and not only the brightest ) are contributing to the correlation , with amplitudes of typically 20 - 30 @xmath1k in the wmap scans .",
    "we fail to detect any statistically significant signal from the ( optical ) aco and apm catalogues , ( although the latter has chances to give a detection if the noise level decreases after the second year of observations ) .",
    "this may reflect the fact that optical catalogues are not sensitive to the temperature of the igm in clusters , and might include many clusters that , being present in the optical , contribute with negligible distortions to the tsz signal , hence diluting the overall cross - correlation .",
    "we believe the impact of foregrounds to be of negligible relevance in our results , provided the fact that our method yields very similar results for different masks ( kp0 and kp2 ) and different cmb scans , ( w band of wmap and the clean map of tegmark , de oliveira - costa & hamilton ( 2003,t03 ) ) .",
    "moreover , all these results are recovered when a ring analysis ( consisting in studying the temperature fluctuations in annuli centered on cluster pixels ) is applied on our catalogues .",
    "with respect to our supercluster templates , we have tested the hypothesis of hot diffuse gas comptonizing the cmb photons in megaparsec scales .",
    "we have built two different supercluster templates , depending upon we place the hot gas uniformly in the superclusters or concentrated around the cluster members . by computing the cross correlation function between these templates and the cmb scans , and comparing it with the template auto - correlation function , we have traced the level at which supercluster induced signal is present in the cmb maps . we find that results depend largely on the cmb map we cross - correlate with : the v & w wmap bands give positive cross - correlation , several @xmath0-levels above zero .",
    "this correlated signal does not vanish when the template is rotated 45 deg in galactic longitude , but drops to zero in the t03 map .",
    "the t03 map keeps the same zero temperature level of all bands of wmap , but combines them in a multipole dependent manner to minimize the presence of foregrounds .",
    "hence , we point to an offset or foregrounds as the most likely responsibles for the different cross - correlation present between our supercluster templates and the w & t03 cmb maps , and we discard the v & w bands from our cross - correlation function analyses .",
    "when applying our method _ ii _ on t03 , we find no significant cross - correlation , and this allows us to place the following constraint on the _ supercluster induced _ comptonization parameter @xmath39 associated to the einasto supercluster catalogues : @xmath2 at the @xmath40 or 95% confidence level .",
    "these figures , however , do not account for the uncertainty related to the modelling of the gas distribution .",
    "finally , we conclude noting that any use of the v & w bands in cross - correlation analyses is at best compromised by the presence of a diffuse foreground component , at least at the level of a few microkelvin .",
