    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) launching relativistically moving plasma jets are classified as radio - loud .",
    "if its jet is pointing towards the earth , the radio - loud agn is called a blazar .",
    "relativistic jets in blazars are capable of producing bright and variable non - thermal emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum @xcite . the large majority of high - galactic latitude sources detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope have been associated to blazars @xcite . based on their optical spectra , blazars are classified as either flat - spectrum radio - quasars ( fsrq ) showing prominent emission lines , or bl lac objects ( bl lacs ) with featureless spectra .",
    "yet both blazar types are ubiquitously hosted by massive red elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , the distribution of host galaxy magnitudes of bl lacs follows a narrow gaussian distribution and bl lac host galaxies can therefore be assumed to be standard candles when estimating their distances @xcite .",
    "it is therefore well established that gamma - ray emission from agn is associated to relativistic jets of blazars launched from the centres of massive elliptical galaxies widely believed to be formed by galaxy mergers .",
    "this scenario has been challenged by the detection of gamma - ray emission from narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) galaxies @xcite that as a class are predominantly radio - quiet and hosted in lower - mass spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the optical emission - line spectra of nlsy1s resemble those of seyfert type 1 galaxies , with the exception of showing remarkably narrow ( fwhm @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) balmer emission lines .",
    "this , together with their cast signatures of large variability in x - rays and prominent fe emission have contributed to the idea that the central engines of nlsy1s are powered by extreme accretion ( rates close to the eddington limit ) onto a young and undermassive black hole that is still growing .",
    "several studies have addressed the multi - wavelength emission of the six gamma - ray nlsy1s so far detected by fermi , converging to the idea that gamma - ray nlsy1 nuclei are blazar like , albeit less powerful @xcite .",
    "little is , however , still known about the host galaxies of the gamma - ray emitting nlsy1s @xcite .    in this work we present for the first time host galaxy images of the gamma - ray nlsy1  pks  2004 - 447 , with a redshift of @xmath2 @xcite and showing core - jet parsec and kiloparsec jet scale structures , it is the radio ",

    "deep nir ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) images of pks  2004 - 447  were obtained with isaac ( infrared spectrometer and array camera ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mounted on ut3 of the vlt at the eso in paranal chile .",
    "isaac is equipped with a @xmath8 pixel hawaii rockwell array , with a pixel scale of 0.147 @xmath9pixel , giving a field of view of @xmath10 .",
    "the observations were performed in service mode during the nights of 14 and 16 april 2013 with excellent atmospheric seeing conditions ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 for j and ks  band , respectively ) .",
    "the total integration time was 600 s for j  band and 110 s for ks  band .",
    "a jitter procedure was used to obtain a set of offset frames ( with individual exposure times of 40 s and 10s for j and ks  band , respectively ) with respect to the initial position .",
    "images were reduced with common procedures using iraf .",
    "each image was flat fielded and sky subtracted using a flat  frame derived from twilight images and a sky  frame derived by median filtering the individual frames in the stack ( after scaling with the median of the number of counts in each image to account for sky intensity variations ) .",
    "the reduced images of each filter were aligned ( using bright stars as reference points in the field ) and combined to produce the final reduced co  added image .",
    "we have used 2mass @xcite bright stars to calibrate the zeropoints of our j and ks band images , resulting in an accuracy of @xmath130.1 mag .",
    "we analyse quantitatively the structure of our nir images of pks  2004 - 447  by modeling their surface brightness distribution with the 2d image decomposition code galfit @xcite .",
    "the images were decomposed into a combination of a central point unresolved source ( representing the agn emission and modeled by a psf ) and galaxy components .    to model the psf",
    ", we selected non  saturated field stars over a wide range of magnitude , without close companions ( closer than @xmath14 ) and preferentially close to the source .",
    "this resulted in a set of 10 stars with magnitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , fwhm(j - band)@xmath17 and fwhm(ks - band)@xmath18 .",
    "we masked out unwanted objects by implementing the sextractor segmentation image @xcite , and fit all the selected stars simultaneously , using 2d modeling consisting of several gaussian and exponential functions .",
    "since our modeled psf can fit adequately all the field stars ( figure [ psf_test ] ) , we are confident that it is a good and stable representation of the true psf of our images .",
    "differences in the psf due to spatial and temporal variations lead to uncertainties in the resulting parameters of our models . to account for this",
    ", we used different psf models ( derived from different combinations of stars ) , assuming that the resulting variations represent the uncertainties due to our psf model imperfection .",
    "additionally , our reported errors take into account the mismatch between our psf and the stars used to model it , in this way , performing the fitting using empirical psfs would result in models with components lying inside the error bars of the components modeled with our psf",
    ".    uncertainties due to our psf imperfection mainly affect the morphology of our models and to a lesser extent , their magnitudes . on the other hand , uncertainties due to the sky background can significantly affect the final magnitudes . to quantify this",
    ", we performed several sky fits in separate 100 px @xmath19 100 px regions of the field and ran our models with the mean ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 of the resulting sky values . the difference in magnitudes due to the uncertainties of the sky value",

    "we first explore whether the surface brightness distribution of the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447   can be well fitted by a de  vaucouleurs  surface brightness profile , typical of elliptical galaxies hosting gamma - ray blazar nuclei @xcite .",
    "the best fitted model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : galfit ] .",
    "nonetheless , inspection of the image and luminosity profile residuals ( see left panels of figure  [ fig : j ] ) show that the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447  is not adequately fitted by a single srsic component .",
    "thus , we added a component to the host galaxy model representing an exponential disc , the latter is motivated by the high incidence of radio - quiet nlsy1s  in late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "middle panels of figures  [ fig : j ] and [ fig : k ] show that the observed surface brightness distribution of pks  2004 - 447 , in each filter , can be better represented with a model comprising a nuclear unresolved source , a bulge and an exponential disc . based on the @xmath23 values listed on table  [ tab :",
    "galfit ] and from an inspection of the residuals in figures  [ fig : j ] and [ fig : k ] , a host galaxy model including a bulge and an exponential disc seems to be more successful to reproduce the observed surface brightness of pks  2004 - 447 .",
    "however , the residual images in both bands ( middle panels in figures  [ fig : j ] and [ fig : k ] ) reveal the presence of two aligned bright spots , consistent with the residual structure obtained with a de  vaucouleurs  model ( left panels ) .",
    "symmetric aligned bright knots are usually found at the ends of stellar bars , the so called ansae or handles of the bar @xcite .",
    "stellar bars have not been detected in agn launching prominent relativistic jets , however , bars appear rather frequent in radio - quiet nlsy1s",
    "@xcite .",
    "we subtract the best - fitted psf and srsic  models from the observed image to search for a bar component in the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447 .",
    "the resultant image is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bar ] revealing a disc component with an elongated brightness enhancement along the inner region .",
    "since the s / n is lower than in the @xmath6-band , the @xmath24-band subtraction is not shown .",
    "hence , it is tempting to visually identify such a structure with a bar . nevertheless , to ascertain the presence of a stellar bar in the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447 , we have used the iraf task ` ellipse ` to fit ellipses to the isophotes of the observed galaxy surface brightness , allowing us to extract ellipticity and position angle ( p.a . )",
    "radial profiles from our both images .",
    "the ellipticity profiles of barred galaxies should increase monotonically and decline abruptly at the transition from the bar to the disk , at the same location a sharp change in pa should be seen @xcite .",
    "moreover , the maximum value of ellipticity should be larger than 0.2 @xcite .",
    "this expected behaviour can be seen in the ellipticity profiles of pks  2004 - 447  shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : bar ] .    since our analysis suggests the presence of a stellar bar , the decomposition of the 2d pks  2004 - 447  host galaxy light distribution should take into account all the structural components .",
    "therefore a four - component model consisting of a psf ( to model the unresolved nuclear agn emission ) , a bulge , an exponential disc and a bar has been fitted to our images of pks  2004 - 447 .",
    "as is customary in studies of barred galaxies , we model the bar with a srsic  component with low @xmath25 @xcite , hereafter we refer to this component simply as the bar .",
    "the best - fit parameters for this model are also listed in table  [ tab : galfit ] and its residual images and radial profiles are shown in the right panels of figures  [ fig : j ] and [ fig : k ] .",
    "we have explored several combinations of parameters in the later model and noticed that including a bulge component with @xmath26 was always resulting in poor fits showing residuals dependence with radial distance and clearly underperforming ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) when compared to our best - fit models ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "similarly , we tried to fit the galaxy without the bulge ( due to its small size ; see table [ tab : galfit ] ) . however , a considerable fraction of light ( b / t@xmath31 ) comes from the bulge , and removing it results in physically meaningless morphologies for the other components of the model ( e.g. srsic index for the bar @xmath32 ) .     and",

    "the best - fit model for the host galaxy structure of pks  2004 - 447  reveals it as a barred late  type disc galaxy . given its stellar mass , estimated from its @xmath35band luminosity ( @xmath36 adopting the mass  to  light ratio found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bar feature is not as expected as it would be for a late  type disc galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that for galaxies with stellar masses ( @xmath37 ) , the fraction of bars in early - type discs is significantly lower ( @xmath38 ) , at all redshifts , than that in late - type discs ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447 also comprises of a bulge with a remarkably low srsic  index ( @xmath40 ) and a bulge  to  total ratio ( b / t@xmath41 and b / t@xmath42 for j and ks  band , respectively without taking into account the agn contribution ) .",
    "these values are well within the characteristics of pseudobulges @xcite",
    ". we can further explore whether pks  2004 - 447  can be classified as having a pseudobulge by comparing the results presented in @xcite with the values in our analysis ( see table [ tab : galfit ] ) that do not depend on magnitude ( since they seem to be independent of wavelength , * ? ? ?",

    "all the latter suggests that the bulge in pks  2004 - 447  should not be classified as classical but as pseudo . unlike classical bulges , commonly found in blazars and radio galaxies ( grown trough mergers )",
    ", pseudobulges are built slowly by the internal evolution of the galaxy , likely driven by the bar . for a full and detailed description on pseudobulges",
    "see @xcite .    a rapidly spinning black hole by - product of a bh ",
    "bh merger is thought to play a fundamental role in triggering of radio loud activity in agn and the launching of relativistic jets from supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "however , the firm detection of a pseudobulge and a stellar bar in the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447  argue for a scenario where an instability driven bulge has concomitantly grown with its black hole via secular processes  albeit some minor galaxy mergers could have occurred .",
    "only a small number of powerful radio galaxies have been found in disc  like host systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and among them , pks 2004 - 447 is the only gamma - ray emitting radio galaxy in which a disky pseudobulge and a stellar bar have been found .",
    "since there is solid observational evidence pointing to the presence of fully developed relativistic jets emanating from pks  2004 - 447  @xcite , it arises that the same spinning black hole conditions that enable the production of prominent relativistic jets can be met , even if non - major merger related black hole fueling mechanisms have ignited the agn .",
    "our results allow simulations and subgrid models to explore the energetic feedback of a radio jet to an interstellar medium different from an elliptical galaxy @xcite and provide tests on black hole spin up mechanisms that are not strictly associated to major bh  bh mergers .",
    "a recent spectropolarimetric observation of pks  2004 - 447  has revealed a broad and double - peaked h@xmath49 profile in polarised light @xcite , this peculiar profile was interpreted as the signature of an obscured disc - like broad - line region . estimating the black hole mass of pks  2004 - 447   from a single - epoch polarised spectrum yields a black hole mass ( @xmath50m@xmath51 ) well within the range of radio - loud agn @xcite . however , double - peaked balmer emission line profiles are highly variable @xcite . thus , bulge stellar kinematics measurements are preferred over emission line widths to estimate black hole masses in double - peaked agn @xcite .",
    "moreover , non - merger driven black hole fueling mechanisms are known to be inefficient , hence , setting an upper limit to the achievable mass of the black hole @xcite , well within the common range of black hole masses estimated for nlsy1 galaxies ( @xmath52 m@xmath51 ) .",
    "therefore , a solid estimation of the black hole mass of pks  2004 - 447  based on its polarised broad emission line profile would require further investigation on whether motions of ionised gas are dominated by gravity or if outflowing winds @xcite , could contribute to shaping the double - peaked profile .",
    "we , however , notice that black holes with masses surpassing 10@xmath53 m@xmath51 have also been found in pseudobulges @xcite . moreover , using the k  band bulge luminosity ( @xmath54 ) from our analysis and the @xmath55 relation of pseudo - bulges from @xcite , we estimate the black hole mass in pks  2004 - 447  to be @xmath56m@xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , our imaging study provides observational evidence for a significant difference between pks  2004 - 447  and the overall population of gamma - ray emitting agn in terms of evolutionary stages of their host galaxies .",
    "we have found that pks  2004 - 447  is powered by a suspected ongoing growing black hole hosted by a galaxy that is actively evolving , albeit slowly via secular processes . although there is ample observational evidence linking the radio - loud agn phenomenon to mergers @xcite",
    ", our results suggest that the growth of a black hole via hierarchical clustering ( major mergers ) might not be strictly required to launch fully developed relativistic jets .",
    "thus , there is an urgent need for more observations to characterise the evolutionary state and nuclear properties of the six nlsy1s detected by fermi so far . to investigate this further ,",
    "we have recently carried out a nir host galaxy imaging of all the gamma - ray nlsy1s known to date and a large sample of radio - loud nlsy1s , to allow comparison between populations .",
    "we have used the nir isaac camera on the vlt to image for the first time the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447   one of the six @xmath57-ray nlsy1  galaxies detected by the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope_. the surface brightness distribution of the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447  has been decomposed with galfit , allowing us to characterise its structural galaxy components .",
    "our main results are listed below :    * we find that the surface brightness distribution of host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447  deviates significantly from a de  vaucouleurs  profile , hence , does not share galaxy morphological features with the overall population of gamma - ray bright agn ( fsrqs , bllacs and radio galaxies ) . *",
    "we perform a 2d bulge - disk decomposition on the images of pks  2004 - 447 , yielding to better results .",
    "however , the presence of two aligned brightness enhancements in the residual images ( see figures  [ fig : j ] and [ fig : k ] ) were further identified as the ansae or handles of a stellar bar . * as a consequence , a 2d bulge - disk - bar decomposition turned out to be the best representation of the host galaxy of pks  2004 - 447 .",
    "most of the observational properties of the best fitted bulge ( e.g. @xmath58 ) are consistent with those reported in literature for pseudobulges .",
    "+ pks  2004 - 447  arises therefore as the first gamma  ray emitting radio  loud agn where a fully developed relativistic jet  able to accelerate particles up to gamma - ray energies  is launched from a pseudo bulge grown via secular processes , and not through mergers .",

    "<S> supermassive black holes launching plasma jets at close to speed of light , producing gamma - rays , have ubiquitously been found to be hosted by massive elliptical galaxies . since elliptical galaxies are generally believed to be built through galaxy mergers , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) launching relativistic jets are associated to the latest stages of galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we have discovered a pseudo - bulge morphology in the host galaxy of the gamma - ray agn pks 2004 - 447 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first gamma  ray emitter radio loud agn found to be launched from a system where both black hole and host galaxy have been actively growing via secular processes . </S>",
    "<S> this is evidence for an alternative black hole - galaxy co - evolutionary path to develop powerful relativistic jets that is not merger - driven . </S>"
