    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to distribute a secret key with a security level unachievable by classical means @xcite . in a qkd protocol",
    "two parties , commonly called alice ( message sender ) and bob ( message receiver ) , want to establish a secret key between them , by sending quantum and classical information through an insecure channel .",
    "the communication channel can be spied by a powerful eavesdropper , typically called eve , who is assumed to be technologically much more advanced than alice and bob .",
    "thus , eve can listen all the transmitted classical messages and manipulate the quantum information at her own will , in principle , being only limited by the laws of quantum physics .",
    "however , this manipulation unavoidably introduces perturbations of quantum nature , which may be detected by the communication partners ( alice and bob ) , depending on the features of the communication protocol they are employing . in such a way , they are able to determine how much information was leaked and keep only the secure part in the final secret key .    standard qkd protocols ( one - way protocols ) , such as bb84 @xcite , six - state @xcite and and sarg04 @xcite , use an encoding method that prevents bob to decode the information in a deterministic way .",
    "this means that a fraction of the transmitted key bits must be discarded , due to the fact that bob s measurements do not allow him to deduce with certainty the corresponding values .",
    "on the other hand , two - way quantum key distribution ( twqkd ) protocols @xcite can provide a solution to this flaw . in this kind of protocols the preparation of the quantum states that will be encoded",
    "is carried out by bob .",
    "therefore , with this additional knowledge , he can always perform the right decoding measurements and no bits must be discarded . an important factor to assess",
    "the performance of a given qkd protocol is the key rate , that is , the number of secret key bits distributed per unit of time . besides the improvements related to technological developments @xcite ,",
    "the use of qudits instead of two - level systems has been proposed as an option to achieve larger secret key rates @xcite .",
    "twqkd protocols have also the potential to fulfill this goal , given that the key bits can be decoded more efficiently than with one - way schemes .",
    "regarding security , it was recently shown that the performance of some twqkd protocols is comparable to that of their one - way counterparts and can even surpass it @xcite .",
    "the two paradigmatic twqkd schemes proposed to date are lm05 ( based on non - orthogonal states ) @xcite and the ping - pong protocol ( based on entanglement ) @xcite , both of them being deterministic . in spite",
    "that the original ping - pong protocol is vulnerable to zero error attacks @xcite , there exists a non - deterministic version that overcomes this shortcoming and has been proven secure @xcite . on the other hand , security proofs for lm05 and a deterministic twqkd protocol inspired on it ( lm05 ) are given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this work",
    "we investigate the security of several twqkd schemes based on non - orthogonal states , including deterministic and non - deterministic ones .",
    "the proofs that we construct guarantee security against collective attacks , when the classical post - processing is implemented with `` direct reconcilliation '' @xcite . in section",
    "ii we describe the basic structure of the protocols studied here . in section",
    "iii we present a simple twqkd protocol , whose security proof constitutes the basis of some subsequent results .",
    "next , we prove in section iv the security of the lm05 protocol , by introducing a slight modification that reduces the corresponding analysis to that of the scheme described in section iii . finally , section v is focused on the study of two new deterministic twqkd protocols .",
    "one of them can be seen as a generalization of the lm05 protocol , due to the use of more than two preparation bases .",
    "we prove that the security of this generalized protocol is the same of lm05 .",
    "for the latter protocol , which we term `` twqkd six - state '' , we provide a lower bound for the eavesdropping information that coincides with the corresponding to the six - state protocol @xcite .",
    "the security of the novel twqkd six - state protocol is at least as good as that of lm05 and probably even bigger ( considering the tightness of the bound tracked down ) .",
    "all the calculations are performed analytically , showing explicitly the attacks that allow eve to get a given amount of information .",
    "we take advantage of the so called gram matrix formulation @xcite in our analysis .",
    "the basic modus operandi of the protocols considered here is the following ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] for a general description ) :    1 .",
    "bob ( the message receiver ) prepares the @xmath0-th qubit state from a basis set @xmath1 , according to some probability distribution , and sends it to alice through the _ quantum forward channel _ ( qfc ) .",
    "alice ( the message sender ) performs the encoding mode ( em ) with probability @xmath2 and control mode ( cm ) with probability @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . in em",
    "she encodes one bit of information , by randomly applying unitary operations from a predetermined set @xmath5 , and sends back the qubit to bob through the _ quantum backward channel _ ( qbc ) . instead , in cm",
    ", she measures the received qubit in a given basis , by choosing randomly among the possible preparation bases used by bob , to get information about the prepared state .",
    "it is important to note that the qfc and the qbc are the same physical channel and the distinction is used to facilitate the description of the eavesdropping attacks .",
    "3 .   bob measures the qubit in the @xmath0-th preparation basis to decode the information .",
    "4 .   after all the qubits have been transmitted and measured , a leftover part of the protocol is carried out throughout a classical channel .",
    "alice publicly reveals which qubits were used for cm and which ones for em . in the case of cm alice and bob",
    "compare the prepared states and the measurement outcomes , whenever alice s measurements had been performed properly in the preparation basis .",
    "this procedure allows them to establish the _ forward noise _ @xmath6 , defined as the probability that such states do nt match up . on the other hand ,",
    "a fraction of the systems used for em is randomly chosen to determine the probability that encoded and decoded symbols be different , @xmath7 , the overall noise .",
    "the remaining symbols are not disclosed and constitute what is known as the `` raw key '' .",
    "_ classical post - processing _ : alice and bob interchange additional classical information in order to obtain identical and completely secret bit strings starting from their raw keys . to this aim",
    "two sub - protocols are required .",
    "the first is called `` error correction '' @xcite and it is used to amend the errors associated to the overall noise @xmath7 . in this way , the encoded and decoded keys become perfectly correlated , i.e. , alice s and bob s bits are identical . in the following sub - protocol information potentially leaked during the quantum transmission",
    "is removed from the key , which is known as `` privacy amplification '' @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the usual approach for the classical post - processing , where the involved sub - protocols are implemented with one - way classical communication ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a different approach ) .     and the unitary operations @xmath5 are chosen probabilistically by bob and alice , respectively .",
    "bob performs the decoding measuring the qubit in the preparation basis and for cm alice measures the received qubit in any of the possible preparation bases ( randomly chosen ) .",
    "alice also chose randomly between em and cm with probabilities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "see the general protocol description in the main text for more details . ]",
    "let us consider a generic twqkd protocol where alice uses the encoding operations set @xmath8 ( the bits `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' are encoded with the application of the unitary operation @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively ) and bob s preparation is such that eve observes the state @xmath11 in the qfc . in what follows we will denote operators acting on the encoded qubit hilbert space with the superscript @xmath12 .",
    "other details , such as the preparation bases used by bob , are irrelevant by now . for keys of infinite size",
    ", the secret fraction , @xmath13 , is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mutual information between alice s and bob s data , which measures the correlation of the encoded and decoded keys .",
    "if alice sends one bit , i.e. , she uses @xmath9 and @xmath10 with equal probability , @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the binary entropy and @xmath7 the probability of miss - matching between the encoded and decoded bit . here ,",
    "we assume ( as usual ) that the quantum channel is a depolarizing channel @xcite and hence @xmath7 does not depend on the specific states carrying the information .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 represents the maximum information that the eavesdropper ( eve ) can obtain using her best strategy ( the expression for @xmath18 will be presented latter ) .",
    "we consider the case of collective attacks and classical post - processing implemented with `` direct reconciliation '' , implying that @xmath18 corresponds to eve s knowledge about the encoded key @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the most general attack that eve can perform in the qfc consists of a joint interaction between the sent qubit and some auxiliar ancilla . without loss of generality ,",
    "this interaction may be represented as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a unitary operation acting on the joint hilbert space of the ancilla and the qubit , and @xmath21 is the ancilla state before the attack .",
    "the set @xmath22 contains the eigenstates of the pauli operator @xmath23 , which corresponds to the @xmath24 direction in the bloch sphere .",
    "unitarity is guaranteed whenever the ancilla states @xmath25 fulfil the conditions : @xmath26    after the forward attack , eve resends the qubit to alice and stores her ancilla until the qubit is sent back through the qbc . in this way ,",
    "the joint encoded states that she can access in the qbc are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 being the state conditioned to the alice s encoded bit `` 0 '' ( `` 1 '' ) . following the definition of collective attack",
    ", eve can extract the encoded information by performing coherent measurements on any number of qubits and ancillae that she considers convenient . to this aim",
    ", it is assumed that she has an unlimited resource of quantum memory at her disposition @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the expression for eve s information is given by @xcite : @xmath31\\right\\},\\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the von neumann entropy and @xmath33 is the holevo quantity @xcite for the alphabet encoded into @xmath34 .",
    "the maximization is taken over all possible eve s unitaries .",
    "since the conditional density operator @xmath35 only differ of @xmath36 by unitary transformations , we can write @xmath37 . hence , @xmath38,\\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 .    to compute eve s information , in eq .  , we need first to obtain the eigenvalues of the alice - eve joint state @xmath40 .",
    "we will perform this task employing the gram matrix representation @xcite . for a mixed state ( written as a mixture of non - orthogonal pure states )",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , the elements of the gram matrix , @xmath43 , are defined as @xmath44 we take advantage of the fact that the eigenvalues of @xmath43 and @xmath45 are the same ( including their multiplicities ) @xcite , and that @xmath40 is by construction a mixture of pure states . in the appendix a we write explicitly this matrix , which is of dimension @xmath46 , and compute its exact eigenvalues .",
    "note that the a priori hilbert space for the joint state @xmath40 is of dimension 8 , given that 4 ancilla states are required to fully describe the eve s forward attack , cf .",
    "this entails a clear advantage of using the gram matrix over the standard method ( in which @xmath40 is written in some orthonormal basis ) , i.e. : first , finding a suitable orthonormal basis is not obvious ; and second , even if that were the case , computing the eigenvalues of a @xmath47 matrix is a considerably more difficult task than doing it for @xmath46 matrix .    from eq .",
    ", we deduce that the perturbation that eve s unitary , @xmath20 , causes on the qubit state @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is given by @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . considering the generic form of a twqkd protocol ( described in section [ section : twqkd ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) the set of bob s prepared states @xmath1 can be written as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the set of bloch sphere directions used in the bob s preparation .",
    "the fact that eve has access to the state @xmath11 in the forward channel means that bob prepared @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the same probability , regardless of the preparation basis direction choice , @xmath24 .",
    "as aforementioned , we are assuming that the qubits are sent through a depolarizing channel and consequently @xmath54 for any choice @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the natural noise of the forward channel , which is simply the probability that alice receives @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) if bob prepared @xmath49 ( @xmath48 ) . in this way , eq .   tells us that , in order to pass unnoticed , eve is restricted to interactions whose perturbation equals @xmath6 for all the transmitted states .",
    "considering this constraint , we obtain in appendix a the following expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath40 : @xmath56\\nonumber \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[1\\pm\\sqrt{(1 - 2q_{f})^{2}+4|\\langle\\epsilon_{00}^{\\hat{z}}|\\epsilon_{10}^{\\hat{z}}\\rangle|^{2}}\\right],\\label{eq:7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each one with multiplicity 2 .",
    "equation is then translated into @xmath57 , for fixed @xmath6 . a simple argument",
    "( see appendix a ) leads to conclude that the von neumann entropy , @xmath58,\\ ] ] takes its maximum when @xmath59 .",
    "thereby , @xmath60 and @xmath61    in this case , eq .   allows to determine eve s information in terms of the noise introduced along the @xmath62 direction , @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that bob must prepare eigenstates of @xmath10 and alice must measure such an observable in cm .",
    "this kind of protocol is clearly non - deterministic since the encoding operations , @xmath8 , have no effect on the states @xmath64 . in the next subsection",
    "we will see that , regardless of the number of preparation bases used , eve s information can not be less than the given by eq .  .",
    "here we show that , if the previous protocol is implemented in a depolarizing channel , no preparation strategy can reduce @xmath18 below the value corresponding to eq .  . to this aim",
    "we present an explicit eavesdropping attack that simulates a depolarizing channel with noise @xmath6 and provides eve @xmath65 bits of information .",
    "besides the condition @xmath66 , this attack satisfies the following equations : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69    a general qubit pure state may be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the azimuthal and polar angles in the bloch sphere , respectively .",
    "the effect of the forward attack is then @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the state orthogonal to @xmath75 and @xmath76 are ancilla states associated to the eve s attack .",
    "the disturbance generated on @xmath75 is @xmath77 , cf .",
    "taking into account eqs .  - , we show in the appendix b that @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we have proved that the attack described by eqs .",
    "- fully simulates a depolarizing channel with characteristic noise @xmath6 . on the other hand , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath79 . although this result could suggest that it is sufficient for bob to prepare only eigenstates of @xmath10 , indeed at least one additional basis must be incorporated into the preparation . as already mentioned , this is necessary because the encoding operations @xmath8 do not affect these prepared states ( the eigenstates of @xmath10 ) .",
    "furthermore , the transmission of non - orthogonal states is the key ingredient to guarantee the protection of the information .",
    "accordingly , the simplest protocol whose security is established by eq .   could be one where the encoding is performed with the set @xmath8 and bob prepares the states @xmath80 .",
    "the results obtained in this section will be employed to prove the security of the lm05 protocol in what follows .",
    "the lm05 protocol corresponds specifically to version 2 of the `` qubit lm05 protocol , implemented with reverse reconciliation '' , proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the encoding operations are @xmath81 and bob s preparation is carried out with the states @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , bob measures the received state in the preparation basis , interpreting an unchanged state as the bit `` 0 '' and one flipped as the bit `` 1 '' .",
    "this implies that the protocol is deterministic , since he can always perfectly distinguish the encoded bit with his measurements . on the other hand , the operations @xmath82 can cause a bit flip or act similarly as the identity , depending on the preparation basis , @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , at the end of the quantum transmission bob must reveal the preparation bases in order to alice can infer all the encoded bits .",
    "it is the disclosing of such information what the authors term `` reverse reconciliation '' in @xcite . here",
    "we will consider that bob s choices and the corresponding to alice in each mode of the protocol ( em and cm ) are performed with equal probability . in cm",
    "she measures randomly the observables @xmath84 and @xmath10 to determine the forward noise .    according to the the description of lm05 ,",
    "there is not a unique holevo quantity to be maximized for obtaining eve s information ( eq .  ) . instead of that , the states from which eve can extract the encoding depend on the associated preparation direction .",
    "suppose for instance that the bob s chosen preparation direction was @xmath62 .",
    "then , @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] , given that the operations sub - set @xmath87 produce a bit flip while the sub - set @xmath8 leave the state unchanged . in this case",
    "the state @xmath40 turns out to be @xmath88 and the corresponding holevo quantity , @xmath89 equation   follows from the fact that @xmath90 and the von neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the same kind of reasoning leads to the holevo quantity corresponding to the bob s preparation in the @xmath91 direction : @xmath92 where @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "in this way , eve s information is given by @xmath94 where the factor @xmath95 stems from the fact that bob uses each preparation basis with equal probability .",
    "the upper bound is due to the general relation @xmath96\\leq\\mathrm{max}f(x)+\\mathrm{max}g(x)$ ] , for @xmath97 and @xmath98 arbitrary functions .",
    "the optimization problem involved in eq .   could , in principle , be a considerable task .",
    "this is so basically due to the fact that the holevo quantities are subtractions of two terms , each one depending on the general unitary @xmath20 employed in the eavesdropping attack .",
    "moreover , the gram matrix associated to @xmath40 would be of dimension @xmath47 , which prevents a possible analytical advantage associated to the use of such a representation . to circumvent this hindrance",
    ", we introduce a slight modification to the protocol , thereby reducing its security proof to that of the protocol considered in the previous section .",
    "such a modification consists in additional classical information that alice publicly reveals at the end of the quantum transmission , such as follows :    * if the preparation direction was @xmath91 and alice used @xmath9 or @xmath10 , she announces that @xmath84 and @xmath99 were discarded .",
    "similarly , if alice used @xmath84 or @xmath99 , she announces that @xmath9 and @xmath10 were discarded . *",
    "if the preparation direction was @xmath62 and alice used @xmath9 or @xmath84 , she announces that @xmath99 and @xmath10 were discarded .",
    "similarly , if alice used @xmath99 or @xmath10 , she announces that @xmath9 and @xmath84 were discarded .",
    "notice that in this scenario eve is unable to obtain directly any information about the encoded bit .",
    "however , the encoded states that she can access in the qbc take a simpler form now .",
    "consider the case when bob s preparation was along the @xmath91 direction and alice used @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath100 @xmath101 where we have designed the density operator by @xmath102 instead of @xmath45 to emphasize that these states correspond to the modified protocol .",
    "the corresponding holevo quantity , @xmath103 , takes exactly the same form when alice performed @xmath84 or @xmath99 , due to the invariance of the von neumann entropy under unitary transformations . using the same reasoning , it is easy to obtain the holevo quantity corresponding to the case when the preparation direction is @xmath62 , whose the general expression is given by @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 $ ] ; @xmath107 being the complementary direction of @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109 if @xmath110 and vice - versa .",
    "the associated expression for eve s information , @xmath111 , is the same of eq .   with the modified holevo quantities .",
    "the bound appearing in that equation can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath114 corresponds exactly to @xmath18 in eq .   and hence @xmath115 .",
    "to find the expression for @xmath116 , we can proceed in a way completely analogous to the one leading to eq .  , writing the gram matrix with the states @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 ( see eq .   and appendix a ) .",
    "it is thus not difficult to grasp that the result is @xmath119 . in this way",
    ", the estimation of the noise @xmath63 ( @xmath120 ) allows to determine eve s information when the encoded states were prepared along the @xmath91 ( @xmath62 ) direction . assuming a depolarizing channel we get @xmath121=h(q_{f}).\\label{eq:17}\\ ] ]    at this point",
    ", we remark that the objective of the introduced modification is to simplify the security proof and by no means is necessary in practice .",
    "actually , it potentially reduces eve s uncertainty about the encoding and therefore @xmath111 ( eq .  ) is an upper bound to the eve s information , @xmath18 , for the lm05 protocol .",
    "furthermore , such a bound coincides with the one calculated in @xcite employing other methods . on the other hand ,",
    "we show in appendix  c that the attack represented by eqs .",
    "- makes such bound in eq .",
    "tight , which implies that for the modified version eve can in fact get @xmath65 bits of information .",
    "considering the lm05 protocol , we note that if besides @xmath62 and @xmath91 one includes the preparation direction @xmath122 and bob always measures in the preparation basis , the resulting scheme is still deterministic .",
    "the reason is that , as in the case of lm05 , the encoding operations @xmath81 always flip or leave unchanged the prepared state depending on the preparation basis .",
    "now let us suppose that alice and bob perform their choices according to a uniform probability distribution .",
    "the resulting scheme , which we term `` twqkd six - state '' ( given the use of the same preparation strategy of the six - state protocol @xcite ) , had not been proposed to date , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we leave the remaining details of the protocol identical to those of lm05. regarding the decoding , for example , alice and bob agree that a unchanged ( flipped ) state corresponds to the bit `` 0 '' ( `` 1 '' ) . to that aim bob",
    "must publicly disclose his basis preparation choices after the quantum transmission , so that alice can know the effect of her operations in each case .",
    "furthermore , in cm alice should measure any of the observables @xmath123 with equal probability , in order to determine the noise introduced along each direction .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] illustrates the quantum part of this protocol .     for the state preparation , ( in em ) alice s encoding operation , and ( in cm ) alice s measurement basis . ]",
    "similar to the lm05 protocol case , for the twqkd six - state protocol there is a holevo quantity associated to each possible direction chosen by bob : @xmath124 where the alice - eve joint state @xmath40 is given by eq .   with the conditional joint state",
    "@xmath125 $ ] , @xmath126 .",
    "likewise , the optimization to obtain eve s information , @xmath127 , is at least as difficult as doing it for lm05 ( eq .  ) .",
    "nevertheless , the security of the twqkd six - state scheme immediately follows from that of lm05 , since the only difference is the usage of the additional preparation direction @xmath122 and it constrains more eve s strategies ( she must now cause the same perturbation not only along @xmath91 and @xmath62 but also along @xmath122 ) .",
    "this implies that eve s information is also upper bounded by @xmath65 , according to eq .  .    in appendix c",
    "we compute the von neumann entropies , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , for the unitary transformation described by eqs . - .",
    "the corresponding eavesdropping information is given by @xmath130 the right hand side of eq .",
    "is identical to the expression for eve s information corresponding to the six - state protocol @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable if one considers that the same kind of states are prepared in both the six - state scheme and its twqkd version .",
    "moreover , the analysed attack is in fact one of the most powerful since it makes tight the bound in eq .",
    ", as we also prove in appendix c. based on these facts , we conjecture that eq",
    ".   actually corresponds to @xmath18 for the twqkd six - state protocol .",
    "we can summarize the results concerning the lm05 and twqkd six - state schemes with the following inequallity : @xmath131 these bounds are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:5.2 ] , as well as the mutual information between alice and bob ( @xmath15 ) , and the eavesdropping information ( @xmath132 ) for the lm05 protocol .     ( blue solid line ) and eve s information ( @xmath132 ) for different protocols , as function of the forward noise ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the overall noise ( q ) and the forward noise coincide , which is the case if the qfc and the qbc are correlated ( see , e.g. , in ref . @xcite some comments at this respect).@xmath132 for the generalized lm05 protocol",
    "is plotted as a ( dark - green ) dotted line .",
    "the upper bound to @xmath132 for lm05 protocol is represented by a ( dark - yellow ) dashed line .",
    "the lower bound to @xmath132 for the twqkd six - state is drawn as the ( dark - red ) dash - dotted line . ]",
    "now let us consider a twqkd protocol in which bob prepares states from the set @xmath134 , i.e. , any state on the perpendicular plane to the @xmath135 direction of the bloch sphere , and alice performs the encoding with @xmath136 .",
    "such a protocol is clearly deterministic and can be considered as a generalization of the lm05 protocol @xcite , which only uses two bases for the preparation , e.g. @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we will show that this generalized protocol does not have any advantage over the standard lm05 , within the assumption that the channel used to transmit the states is depolarizing .",
    "we start computing the eavesdropping information for the attack described by the following conditions : @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 this attack only differs from the one represented by eqs . - concerning the value of the element @xmath142 .",
    "in addition , we write @xmath63 instead of @xmath6 because @xmath63 is not the disturbance measured in this protocol .    considering that the state @xmath143 is equal to @xmath75 ( defined in section iii b ) for @xmath144",

    ", we get @xmath151 we have taken into account that @xmath152 must coincide with the forward noise . the expression in eq .",
    "is exactly the found for the lm05 protocol in @xcite and therefore we have proved that it is not possible to improve the protocol security with this extended version on the number of preparation basis .",
    "we have studied the performance of twqkd protocols that distribute a secret key by means of non - orthogonal qubit states . for the security analysis",
    "we have used techniques whose application is new in the context of secure communications , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "specifically , we employed a matrix representation @xcite that allows to easily compute the eigenvalues of certain density operators , involved in the determination of the amount of the eavesdropping information . in this way , a simple calculation leads to eq .  , which is the more important expression for the posterior analysis .",

    "we remark that the security of the twqkd six - state protocol is possibly better than that of the lm05 protocol , since an additional preparation basis is used by bob , and therefore our lower bound could be tight .",
    "finally , we showed that the inclusion of more than two preparation bases does not improve the security of the lm05 protocol @xcite .",
    "the construction of a full security proof for the new twqkd six - state protocol proposed here as well as its experimental analysis and tests are interesting directions for a future research .",
