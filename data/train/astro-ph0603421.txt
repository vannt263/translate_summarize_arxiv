    "this is the second paper in a series presenting the discovery of new strong galaxy  galaxy lenses , i.e. systems where a background galaxy is multiply",
    " imaged by a foreground galaxy .",
    "the motivation for this work is the opportunity such lenses give for accurately measuring the projected mass profiles in the lenses , of both the baryons and the dark matter , with greater precision than has been achieved by other methods .",
    "analysis of galaxy  galaxy lenses requires models for the mass distribution in the lens , and the flux distribution in the unlensed source ( e.g. wallington , kochanek & narayan 1996 ; warren & dye 2003 ; suyu et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the resulting model image is matched to the observed image , which provides typically hundreds of constraints because the highly stretched image extends over many resolution elements .",
    "by contrast , for lensed quasars ( i.e. point sources , producing point images ) the fluxes can not be used straightforwardly , because of the possibility individual images are amplified by microlensing , leaving only the positions of just two or four images as constraints .",
    "this explains why galaxy  galaxy lenses are much more powerful than lensed quasars .    by comparison with gravitational lensing , dynamical methods typically rely on a number of assumptions , such as that the system is relaxed and is spherically symmetric .",
    "the utility of galaxy  galaxy lenses for measuring galaxy mass profiles and the advantages of lensing over dynamics are illustrated by two different analyses of the hst wfpc2 image of the einstein ring b00472808 .",
    "the first , by koopmans & treu ( 2003 ) , is principally a dynamical analysis , using the measured radial profile of the stellar velocity dispersion , supplemented by the constraint provided by the size of the einstein ring , which measures the total enclosed projected mass .",
    "the second analysis , by dye & warren ( 2005 ) , is a pure lensing analysis , but uses all the ( flux@xmath8positional ) information in the image . in both analyses the mass in the lens",
    "was assumed to comprise two components ; a baryonic component with mass profile the same as the light profile , of unknown mass  to  light ratio @xmath9 , embedded in an elliptical non  baryonic dark ",
    "matter halo , with unknown central power  law exponent @xmath10 .",
    "the lensing analysis produced much smaller uncertainties in the parameters than the dynamical analysis ( fig . 3 in dye & warren , 2005 ) .",
    "the baryonic fraction of the projected mass within the einstein radius measured in the lensing analysis is @xmath11 at @xmath12 confidence .",
    "the size of the uncertainty , from a single system , is similar to that achieved by rusin , kochanek & keeton ( 2003 ) in their statistical analysis of 22 lensed quasars .",
    "this further emphasises the advantage of galaxy  galaxy lenses over lensed quasars .",
    "in fact the wfpc2 image of b00472808 is of relatively low signal - to - noise ratio . as we show below , future observations of this and other systems with the hst ",
    "acs high resolution camera ( hrc ) , which has higher throughput and better sampling , will be substantially more powerful .",
    "the number of galaxy  galaxy lenses known where the lensed source is reasonably bright , e.g. @xmath13 , and therefore suitable for acs imaging , was until now very small .",
    "the situation has been transformed in the past few months , and the sample of suitable systems has increased by an order of magnitude . in the first paper in this series ( willis , hewett & warren 2005 , hereafter whw05 ) we listed the three previously known examples ( warren et al .",
    "1996 ; bolton et al . 2005",
    "; cabanac et al .",
    "2005 ) and announced the discovery of two new bright galaxy  galaxy lenses .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have provided a further example .",
    "our survey is based on the ` optimal line  of  sight ' ( ols ) strategy described by hewett et al .",
    "2000 , i.e. targeting those galaxies that are most likely to lens background sources . in the current paper we present five more new bright galaxy  galaxy lenses .",
    "all seven new lenses from our survey were identified as candidates by searching for anomalous emission lines ",
    "typically [ oii]3727 , h@xmath14861 or [ oiii]5007 emission   in the spectra of luminous , bulge  dominated galaxies , in the spectroscopic database of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) spectroscopic sample forms the bulk of the spectroscopic targets for anomalous emission features . the @xmath14 sample is dominated numerically by lrgs . ] .",
    "full details of our survey ( hereafter the ols  lens survey ) will be provided in a future paper ( hewett et al . in preparation ) .",
    "a similar survey is being undertaken by bolton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who list 49 candidates .",
    "the two surveys are largely complementary , and are compared and contrasted in whw05 . immediately before submission of this paper , bolton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) announced the remarkable discovery of 19 new galaxy  galaxy lenses , confirmed by their morphology in hst ",
    "acs snapshot images .",
    "we have checked that none of our new lenses are in their list .",
    "our methodology for confirming spectroscopically  selected candidates is firstly to obtain deeper broadband images than the original sdss exposures ( 54s on a 2.5 m telescope ) , typically 10min exposures in the @xmath15 band on a 4 m telescope .",
    "fitting of smooth model galaxy profiles is used to subtract the image of the deflector galaxy in order to search for images of the source responsible for the emission line . in the majority of cases we find either one or more images within @xmath16 of the galaxy centre .",
    "but at this stage , even in good seeing conditions , @xmath17 , the results are usually ambiguous as to whether the system is a gravitational lens , or a chance superposition , or a peculiar galaxy core .",
    "to confirm that the system is a gravitational lens we require the spectroscopic detection of two images of the emission line on either side of the spectrum of the deflector galaxy .",
    "the @xmath15 band imaging provides the information to maximise the chances of success , by aligning the slit along the line from the galaxy centre to the putative brightest lensed image .",
    "so far , following these procedures , we have confirmed seven lenses through observations of just 11 candidates . the solitary candidate that shows",
    "no evidence for lensing in an @xmath15 band image of similar quality to those in figure 2 , is sdss j212628.78 + 111808.0 , @xmath18 and it is likely that the putative [ oii ]  @xmath03726,3729 emission line detection at @xmath19  is spurious .",
    "three additional candidates show evidence for the presence of extended morphologies of the background emission line source but suitable spectroscopic observations remain to be undertaken . our success rate ( and that reported by bolton et al . , 2006",
    ") demonstrates that the sdss dr4 spectroscopic sample ( adelman  mccarthy et al . , 2005 )",
    "contains many tens of galaxy  galaxy lenses that are easy to identify .",
    "this resource can provide an increase in the number of confirmed galaxy ",
    "galaxy lenses by over an order of magnitude , such that the number of known galaxy ",
    "galaxy lenses could rival the number of known lensed quasars .",
    "given the potential of galaxy  galaxy lenses to determine the mass distribution within massive galaxies , such surveys are an important development in the field of gravitational lensing .",
    "our final goal is to measure the mass profiles of a substantial sample of deflector galaxies through the lens inversion of deep acs images of confirmed systems brighter than @xmath20 .",
    "we have undertaken end - to - end modeling of acs observations of galaxy  galaxy lenses , in order to determine the feasibility of measuring accurate mass profiles for such a sample in a reasonable number of orbits , and to decide between the acs  hrc and acs wide field camera ( wfc , higher throughput , larger pixels ; gonzaga et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we employ the semi  linear inversion technique of warren and dye ( 2003 ) , and dye and warren ( 2005 ) .",
    "an example of the modeling is shown in fig .",
    "successive rows illustrate the input model , and the results for integrations of 1 orbit with the wfc , 1 orbit with the hrc , and 5 orbits with the hrc .",
    "the middle column shows the source ( either input , or reconstructed by the inversion algorithm ) , and the left ",
    "column shows the image , with pixel size and noise characteristics appropriate for the selected instrument and integration time . for this simulation",
    "the integrated brightness of the lensed source was @xmath21 , the axis ratios ( @xmath22 ) of the baryonic and dark matter components were @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , and external shear was not modeled .",
    "the right  hand column illustrates the resulting confidence contours on the two most interesting parameters of the mass model , namely @xmath10 , the inner slope of the dark matter mass distribution , and @xmath9 , the restframe b  band mass  to  light ratio of the baryons .",
    "the input values of these two parameters were 0.85 and 3.0 respectively .",
    "the points to note are , firstly , that despite the lower throughput the uncertainties are smaller for the hrc than the wfc for the same integration time , as a consequence of the better sampling , and , secondly , that the uncertainties shrink approximately with the square root of the number of orbits .",
    "more quantitatively , the @xmath12 confidence range on the inner slope are @xmath25 for 1 orbit with the wfc , @xmath26 for 1 orbit with the hrc , and @xmath27 for 5 orbits with the hrc .",
    "this simulation demonstrates that for a relatively bright galaxy  galaxy lens it is feasible to measure the inner slope of the dark matter mass distribution to an accuracy @xmath5 with just a few orbits integration .",
    "similarly tight constraints on @xmath9 , and on the dark matter mass fraction inside the einstein radius are obtained .",
    "the above analysis rests on a number of simplifying assumptions , including that the central dark - matter density profile is of power - law form , that the dark - matter isodensity contours have constant ellipticity , that external shear is negligible , and that a constant m / l for the baryons is appropriate . relaxing any of these assumptions",
    "could introduce strong correlations between parameters , and so increase the uncertainties . fortunately the new hst - acs data ( e.g. bolton et al . ,",
    "2006 ) are of much higher s / n than the system analysed by dye and warren ( 2005 ) , and will allow more elaborate mass models to be explored .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the analysis of galaxy - galaxy lenses is in its infancy , and deep images of a large number of systems will allow exploration of the relative value , in providing constraints on the mass profile , of different image configurations ( due to the variables of source impact parameter , lens ellipticity , and source size , which determines the ring thickness ) .    in the next section",
    "we describe the follow - up imaging (  2.1 ) and spectroscopic (  2.2 ) observations of the five new lenses , and then discuss the evidence that each of the systems is a gravitational lens . in ",
    "3 we provide a brief summary .",
    "in the following discussion all quoted @xmath15 and @xmath28 magnitudes refer to the sdss filter set , and are on the ab system .",
    "deeper red  band observations of the five lens systems presented in this paper were performed during two separate observing runs .",
    "table 1 provides details of the imaging observations of the five new systems .",
    "successive columns list the object name , the j2000 coordinates , the telescope+camera combination , the seeing , the filter , and the integration time . the systems j1246 + 0440 and j14460248 were imaged in non  photometric conditions using the prime focus imaging camera ( pfip _ ( sic ) _ ) , with the harris red filter , hereafter @xmath29 , at the 4 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on 2005 may 16 and 13 respectively .",
    "the systems j1150 + 1016 , j2156 + 1204 and j22310849 were observed with the european southern observatory ( eso ) multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) , with the gunn red filter , hereafter @xmath30 , at the 3.5 m eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) during 2005 june 67 , in clear conditions .",
    "the data were processed employing standard ccd reduction techniques . for both filters @xmath29 and @xmath30 we computed the photometric zero point , and colour term to convert to @xmath15 using the sdss measured @xmath15 and @xmath28 magnitudes of stars in each frame .",
    "then , using the sdss measured @xmath31 colour of each target galaxy , we calibrated the counts in the galaxy to the @xmath15 system .",
    "note that photometric conditions are not required for calibration performed in this way .    to look for evidence of lensing ( arcs or multiple images )",
    ", the surface brightness distribution of the deflector galaxy was modeled and subtracted .",
    "we used the elliptical sersic model for the surface  brightness profile , convolved with the point spread function , defined by stars in the frame .",
    "the model has the following seven free parameters : x , y , orientation , ellipticity , half - light radius @xmath32 , surface brightness @xmath33 at @xmath32 , and sersic index @xmath34 .",
    "the fitting was iterated , successively improving the masking of any underlying images revealed .",
    "fuller details of the fitting procedure are provided in wayth et al .",
    "while the subtraction in each case is visually satisfactory and therefore suitable for the purposes of searching for lensed images , in most cases the @xmath35 of the fit is formally unsatisfactory .",
    "table [ sersicfits ] provides the best  fit values of the three parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for each system , together with the computed total magnitude .",
    "the remaining entries in table 2 are the total magnitude of the source image ( see below ) , the source redshift ( from  2.2 ) , and the redshift and velocity dispersion ( if provided ) of the lens galaxy , taken from the sdss database .",
    "we find very good agreement between our lens  galaxy total magnitudes and the sdss de vaucouleurs  model total magnitudes , in the following sense . for values of @xmath36",
    "our total magnitudes are brighter than the sdss model magnitudes , as would be expected , because at large radii , beyond the fitted region , our surface brightness profiles fall off less steeply than the de vaucouleurs model . where our measured profiles have @xmath37 the opposite is true .",
    "plotting the magnitude difference between our model and the sdss model against @xmath34 , and fitting a linear relation , the offset at the value @xmath38 is only 0.04mag .",
    "the images of the five fields both before and after subtraction are displayed in fig .",
    "[ 5image ] .",
    "each image is oriented to match the position angle of the spectroscopic observation such that the slit lies horizontally in these images . in each case , subtraction of the galaxy surface brightness profile revealed the presence of additional sources within 12  of the galaxy centroid , i.e. within the typical einstein radius expected if the galaxy is acting as a massive deflector , of one  dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath39  kms@xmath40 , the angular diameter of the einstein ring is 15 and 22 for source redshifts of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively . ] .",
    "we note that the residual image features displayed in fig .",
    "[ 5image ] are , in some cases , not unlike features anticipated from the subtraction of an imperfect parameterized model ( i.e. , to the extent that the lens galaxies are not exactly sersic ellipsoids ) . however , while we acknowledge the possibility , this explanation is ruled out by the results of the long slit spectroscopy presented in  2.2 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the brightness of the sources , because they lie at small radii , where the residuals from the galaxy subtraction are greatest .",
    "nevertheless , under the lens hypothesis , most of the flux will lie in an annulus close to the einstein radius , whereas the worst galaxy residuals will occur at the smallest radii . with this in mind we adopted a simple recipe , integrating the flux in the subtracted frames in an annulus of radial extent @xmath43 .",
    "these values are entered in table 2 .",
    "we have not attempted to estimate the uncertainty on these values , which are dominated by systematic errors associated with the galaxy subtraction .",
    "the average estimated source total magnitude is @xmath44 , which is encouraging in the light of the simulations presented in fig . 1 .",
    "we now discuss each image in turn . ,    * j1150 + 1016 : * the subtracted image shows a promising incomplete  ring structure like a horseshoe . at the same time there are relatively large + /-",
    "residuals near the galaxy centre , and we found that the flux distribution around the candidate ring was somewhat sensitive to the exact masking of the source employed .",
    "this is as expected given the rather poor seeing ( table 1 ) and the relative faintness of the source ( table 2 ) . therefore while we might expect a higher  resolution image of the system to present a somewhat different morphology , the image is nevertheless very suggestive of lensing , and we oriented the slit e ",
    "w to maximise the chance of detecting the emission line on either side of the lensing galaxy .",
    "* j1246 + 0440 : * the subtraction reveals a pair of faint images either side of the galaxy centre , consistent with the lensing hypothesis .",
    "the flux ratio between the two residual images was rather sensitive to the exact mask used .",
    "the positive residuals are substantially larger than the negative residuals .",
    "therefore we were confident that both images are real , and aligned the slit to include both .",
    "* j1446 - 0248 : * we see two relatively bright residual images , either side of the target galaxy , consistent with the lensing hypothesis . we aligned the slit to include both images .",
    "* j2156 + 1204 : * this image is rather complicated .",
    "there is an elongated image , resembling an inclined spiral at @xmath45 to the s , and a smaller image @xmath46 further to the s. in our spectrum we detect continuum from the latter , and an emission line near @xmath47 from the former",
    ". the line might be [ oii ]  @xmath03726,3729 or h@xmath48 @xmath496565 , but in either case the object is not at the redshift of the target galaxy or of the source .",
    "the measured source magnitude quoted in table 2 will be brighter than the reality because some flux from this object will be included in the measurement annulus .",
    "closer in , a faint residual structure reminiscent of the horshoe seen for j1150 + 1016 is weakly visible .",
    "similar remarks about the morphology of the structure apply here i.e. it is suggestive of lensing , but a higher - resolution image may look somewhat different .",
    "we aligned the slit ns , as the image indicates flux from the source on either side of the target galaxy along this axis .    * j2231 - 0849 : * the residual image for this source shows a remarkably bright ring .",
    "varying the region masked made little difference to this conclusion , and we considered it highly likely that this is a bright example of an einstein ring .",
    "we aligned the slit to intersect the brightest part of the ring .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we followed the same procedures for the spectroscopy as in whw05 , i.e. we oriented the slit at a position angle suggested by the imaging , and then after data reduction and sky subtraction , we subtracted the spectrum of the deflector galaxy , and searched for paired images of an emission line on either side of the position of the galaxy , at the wavelength of the emission line(s ) detected in the original sdss spectrum .",
    "finally we extracted near ",
    "optimal spectra of the sources to search for additional lines to corroborate the redshifts .",
    "only brief details of the procedures for subtracting the galaxy spectrum , and extracting the source spectrum are provided here .",
    "the reader is referred to whw05 for fuller details .",
    "spectroscopic observations were performed during 2005 june 67 using the red image low dispersion ( rild ) configuration of the emmi instrument at the eso ntt .",
    "systems j1150 + 1016 , j14460248 , j2156 + 1204 and j22310849 were observed using emmi grism # 6 and a 10 slit , providing spectral coverage from 5800 to 8500 , at a resolving power @xmath50 .",
    "system j1246 + 0440 was observed with emmi grism # 5 and a 10 slit , providing spectral coverage from 4000 to 7000 , at a resolving power @xmath51 .",
    "the spatial scale at each configuration was 033 pix@xmath40 .",
    "integrations were typically split into either three or four exposures of 1800s each . the slit position angle and exposure time used for each system",
    "are provided in table [ tab_lens_values ] .",
    "the typical atmospheric seeing over the two observing nights was 08 to 10 although observations of j1246 were performed in 12 seeing .",
    "conventional procedures were followed for bias subtraction and flatfielding .",
    "the multiple frames for each target were then averaged , employing a sigma  clipping algorithm in order to remove cosmic ray events .",
    "small sections of the final frames for each system are shown in fig .",
    "[ 5spec ] . for each system",
    ", the upper panel shows the reduced two dimensional frame prior to sky subtraction .",
    "after sky subtraction , a low order cubic spline function was fit up each column .",
    "this is effective in subtracting the spectrum of the lens galaxy ( at wavelengths away from the strongest absorption lines ) .",
    "the resulting frames , convolved with a gaussian of @xmath52 pixel , for display purposes only , are provided in the lower panels for each system .",
    "all analysis was undertaken on the unconvolved frames .",
    "all systems show an emission line at the expected wavelength , split on either side of the lens galaxy . in each case",
    "we conclude that the emission line seen is [ oii ]  @xmath03726,3729 , and consequently the detected object lies at a redshift larger than the target galaxy .",
    "these two facts combined are sufficient to conclude that each system is a gravitational lens .",
    "we note that two dimensional long slit spectroscopy provides only limited constraints on the detailed image morphology of the lensed emission line source .",
    "the important point however , is that resolution of the emission line source into multiple components provides compelling evidence for the lensing hypothesis .",
    "we discuss each system in turn below .    in table 3",
    "we summarise the characteristics of the image configuration , as measured in the spectrum , for each system , listing the image splitting , the impact parameters of the primary ( a , i.e. brightest ) and secondary ( b ) images , the flux ratio , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the detection of the fainter image . in some cases",
    "the snr of the detections of the two images is less than in the @xmath15band images .",
    "nevertheless , because the contrast of the line over the spectrum of the galaxy is much greater than in the @xmath15band images , the systematic errors from subtraction of the galaxy will be smaller .",
    "therefore we consider that the relevant quantities summarised in table 3 are more reliably derived from the spectroscopic frames than from the @xmath15band images .",
    "we extracted one dimensional spectra of the deflector galaxy and the bright and faint images of the lensed emission ",
    "line galaxy in each system using the procedure described in whw05 .",
    "the procedure models each component ( deflector galaxy plus images a and b ) on the reduced two  dimensional spectral frame as a gaussian spatial profile of specified full ",
    "width at half  maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the relative spatial separation of the components and the flux ratio between image a and b are fixed .",
    "the fitting procedure computes a best  fitting system centroid and vertical normalisation for the deflector galaxy and image a component by minimising the @xmath35 statistic .",
    "the resultant two  dimensional model provides the relative contribution of the deflector galaxy , image and a and b at each spatial pixel , permitting straightforward extraction of the data for each source .",

    "the measured flux ratio for this system is at first sight peculiar . for a simple model of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) and a point source , for images",

    "<S> we present five new examples , identified via the optimal line  of  sight gravitational lens search strategy applied to luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> our survey largely complements a similar survey by bolton et al . </S>",
    "<S> , who recently presented several new lenses . </S>",
    "<S> the lensed background galaxies are selected from the sdss spectra via the presence of narrow emission line signatures , including the [ oii ]  @xmath03726,3729 , h@xmath1 and [ oiii ]  @xmath04960,5008 lines , superposed on the spectra of the bright , intervening , deflector galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our five confirmed new systems include deflector galaxies with redshifts @xmath2 and lensed galaxies with redshifts @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of moderately deep ( few orbits ) hst  acs imaging of systems such as these , where the lensed source is brighter than @xmath4 , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> these demonstrate the feasibility of measuring accurately the inner slope of the dark matter halo to within an uncertainty @xmath5 , the dark matter fraction within the einstein radius , and the mass  to  light ratio of the stars alone , independently of dynamical measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the high success rate of our search so far , @xmath6 , and the relatively modest observational resources necessary to confirm the gravitational lens nature of the candidates , demonstrate that compilation of a sample of @xmath7100 galaxy - galaxy lenses from the sdss is readily achievable , opening up a rich new field in dark matter studies .    </S>",
