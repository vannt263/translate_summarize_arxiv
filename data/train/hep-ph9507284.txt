    "our understanding of inclusive decays of hadrons containing at least one heavy quark has improved greatly over the last few years .",
    "the energy released during semileptonic or radiative decay of heavy hadrons is much larger than the scale @xmath3 of the strong interactions , and therefore an operator product expansion ( ope ) exists for some observables in these decays , including rates and differential spectra @xcite .",
    "the leading power corrections to the rates and lepton differential spectra for semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons@xcite have been studied extensively , as have the power corrections to radiative decays @xcite .",
    "a major result of this analysis is that , except in regions where the expansion becomes singular such as the endpoint of the electron spectrum in semileptonic @xmath4 decay , the corrections to the parton model are quite small , suppressed by @xmath5 .",
    "while this does mean that the parton model is quite successful , it makes it difficult to test quantitatively the corrections given by the ope . in particular ,",
    "if quark / hadron duality does not hold in this energy regime , one would expect to see corrections to the parton model which could not be accounted for by the leading perturbative and @xmath6 corrections .",
    "shifman has recently criticized the related ope analysis of @xmath7 decay on the basis that violations of duality in the minkowski regime introduce large corrections which are not seen at any finite order in the ope  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we suggest that hadronic variables , in particular moments of the invariant mass spectrum @xmath8 and the hadron energy spectrum @xmath9 , provide a useful testing ground for the ope .",
    "this is similar to the analogous suggestion , and analysis , for semileptonic @xmath7 decays  @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the case for @xmath7 decays , at tree level the final hadronic state at the parton level consists of a single quark .",
    "therefore at lowest order in the ope the final hadronic state has fixed invariant mass @xmath10 , and positive moments of @xmath11 , which are calculable as a double expansion in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , directly probe physics beyond the parton model . similarly , at leading order in the ope the maximum hadron energy is @xmath14 ( when the quark @xmath15 recoils back - to - back with the leptons ) ; the region above this endpoint is populated only by gluon bremsstrahlung and nonperturbative effects .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the corrections to the parton model results for these observables , up to @xmath16 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the leading power corrections to leptonic variables arise at @xmath17 , for kinematic reasons the leading power corrections to moments of the invariant mass spectrum arise at @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 corrections to the differential hadronic energy spectrum were first examined in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , we disagree with the results presented in that work .",
    "we also use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the one - loop corrections to the hadron energy spectrum were calculated .",
    "we combine our results with recent data on @xmath0 meson branching ratios to obtain a lower bound on the nonperturbative parameter @xmath20 , which is the leading contribution to the difference between heavy quark and heavy meson masses .    finally , using the blm prescription  @xcite to estimate the size of the two - loop perturbative corrections to the moments of the invariant mass spectrum , we demonstrate that the first moment appears to have a well - behaved perturbative expansion not only for @xmath0 decays , but also for @xmath21 decays , when the results are expressed in terms of physical observables .",
    "this suggests that studying hadronic observables in semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons , which are dominated by only two or three resonances , may shed some insight into the applicability of quark / hadron duality at low energies .",
    "we start by introducing the kinematic variables describing the final state hadrons . for definiteness , we will consider semileptonic @xmath0 decay , although the analysis extends simply to the decays of charmed hadrons .",

    "it is convenient to define dimensionless parton level quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "at leading order in @xmath13 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are simply the scaled energy and squared invariant mass of the final hadronic state . however , since they are scaled by the @xmath25 _ quark _ mass , this identification does not hold at subleading order in @xmath13 . instead",
    ", they are related to the physical hadronic energy and squared invariant mass , @xmath34 through @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and the ellipses denote terms higher order in @xmath13 .",
    "the quantities @xmath20 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 arise in the relationship between the quark and meson masses  @xcite , @xmath39 from the measured @xmath0@xmath40 mass splitting , @xmath41 .",
    "we note that in contrast to the lepton spectra , there are @xmath13 corrections both to the physical hadronic invariant mass spectrum and to the physical hadronic energy spectrum , although these corrections are absent for the @xmath31 and @xmath30 spectra @xcite .",
    "while the complete shape of the @xmath30 spectrum may be calculated ( away from the parton model endpoint @xmath42 ) with the standard ope analysis , only suitably averaged features , such as moments , of the @xmath31 spectrum may be computed reliably .",
    "the difference arises because each point of the @xmath30 spectrum receives contributions from states of different invariant masses , making the process inclusive , whereas by definition each point of the @xmath31 spectrum only receives contributions from states of a single invariant mass .",
    "this may be seen explicitly by carrying out the usual ope analysis for inclusive decays in the variables @xmath31 and @xmath30 , instead of the usual leptonic variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "we also note that the integration region covers the one - particle pole at @xmath66 only if @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , this corresponds to the maximum energy the final quark can take away in the decay process .",
