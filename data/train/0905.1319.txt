    "[ stack - scheme - functor ] recall that schemes can be defined in at least two equivalent ways .",

    "[ covers]a scheme is more than a sheaf , of course , in that it must have an open cover by affine schemes .",
    "similarly , we have _ algebraic stacks _ , which have a suitable cover by schemes .",
    "here is a short explanation .",
    "a morphism @xmath122 of stacks is _ representable _ if for all morphisms @xmath123 with @xmath17 a scheme , the @xmath60-category pull - back ( or homotopy pull - back ) @xmath124 is equivalent to a scheme .",
    "a representable morphism then has algebraic property @xmath125 ( flat , smooth , surjective , tale , etc . )",
    "if all the resulting morphisms @xmath126 have that property .",
    "a stack @xmath127 is then called algebraic if    1 .",
    "every morphism @xmath128 with @xmath129 a scheme is representable ; and 2 .   there is a smooth surjective map @xmath130 with @xmath17 a scheme .    the morphism @xmath131 is called a presentation . note",
    "that an algebraic stack may have many presentations ; indeed , flexibility in the choice of presentations leads to interesting theorems . see @xcite , for an example of this phenomenon .",
    "if the presentation can be chosen to be tale , we have a _ deligne - mumford stack_.    [ not - alg - stack ] the stack @xmath22 is not algebraic , in this sense , as it only has a flat presentation , not a smooth presentation . if we define @xmath132 to be the functor which assigns to each ring @xmath11",
    "the set of formal group laws over @xmath11 , then lazard s theorem @xcite says that @xmath133 where @xmath32 is ( non - canonically ) isomorphic to @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "the map @xmath135 which assigns a formal group law to its underlying formal group is flat and surjective , but not smooth since it s not finitely presented .",
    "this difficulty can be surmounted in two ways : enlarge the notion of an algebraic stack to include flat presentations or note that @xmath22 can be written as the 2-category inverse limit of a tower of the algebraic stacks of `` buds '' of formal groups and is , thus , pro - algebraic .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "[ mod - sheaves ] a sheaf in the @xmath35-topology on @xmath22 is a functor @xmath136 on the category of affine schemes over @xmath22 which satisfies faithfully flat descent .",
    "thus , for each formal group @xmath9 over @xmath11 we get a set ( or ring , or module , etc . )",
    "@xmath137 and for each @xmath60-commuting diagram @xmath114^h \\ar[dd]_f\\\\ & \\cm_\\fg\\\\ \\spec(r)\\ar[ur]_g   } \\ ] ] a restriction map @xmath138 .",

    "for example , define the structure sheaf @xmath142 to be the functor on affine schemes over @xmath22 with @xmath143 more generally , we consider module sheaves @xmath136 over @xmath142 .",
    "such a sheaf is called _ quasi - coherent _ if , for each @xmath60-commutative diagram , the restriction map @xmath144 extends to an isomorphism @xmath145 this isomorphism can be very non - trivial , as it depends on the choice of isomorphism @xmath146 which makes the diagram @xmath60-commute .",
    "a fundamental example of a quasi - coherent sheaf is the sheaf of invariant differentials @xmath147 with @xmath148 the invariant differentials on @xmath9 .",
    "this is locally free of rank @xmath10 and hence all powers @xmath149 , @xmath150 , are also quasi - coherent sheaves .",
    "the effect of the choice of isomorphism in the @xmath60-commuting diagram on the transition maps for @xmath149 is displayed in equations [ inv1 ] and [ inv2 ] .",
    "consider the @xmath60-category pull - back @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the functor of formal group laws .",

    "one of the two projections @xmath158 shows @xmath159 and the other projection supplies the comodule structure map .",
    "i will say something about how you pass from comodules to sheaves at the beginning of the next section .",
    "it is here we see the flexibility of choosing the presentation .",
    "for example , if we work localized at some prime @xmath1 and consider the stack @xmath160 then we could use the scheme of @xmath1-typical formal group laws as our cover and obtain a different category of comodules closely related ( up to issues of grading ) to @xmath161-comodules .",
