    "the anti de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence is a powerful method to investigate strongly coupled theories . an interesting application of such duality is the study of systems at finite temperature and density of some conserved quantum number .",
    "this is the typical situation in condensed matter physics and in the last few years a considerable amount of work has been dedicated to the development of holographic methods for condensed matter systems ( reviews of which can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the simplest realizations one deals with einstein s gravitational theory with a negative cosmological constant coupled to a gauge field ( dual to the conserved current ) .",
    "while this setup captures some interesting properties of realistic systems , the low temperature behavior has some disturbing features .",
    "a classic example , which is perhaps unphysical rather than disturbing , is the fact that the simplest charged black hole solution predicts a nonvanishing entropy in the zero temperature limit .",
    "this situation can be improved @xcite by adding a real scalar field @xmath1 ( _ a dilaton _ ) , which interacts with the gauge field by modifying its gauge coupling @xmath2 , = , [ running - coupling ] where @xmath3 , and self - interacts through a potential .",
    "this allows for zero entropy at zero temperature .",
    "moreover , real scalars of this type are typically present in the low energy limit of string theories and their inclusion may be good if eventually one has to find a stringy embedding .    in this work",
    "we initiate the study of holographic superfluids and superconductors in dilaton extensions of einstein s gravity . like in the absence of the dilaton",
    ", the minimal description of these systems requires a conserved u(1 ) current and a charged condensing operator , which are respectively dual to an abelian gauge field and a charged scalar living on an asymptotically ads space @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "then the dilaton can couple directly not only to the gauge field but also to the charged scalar . in the case of superconducting materials",
    "the u(1 ) symmetry is gauged while for superfluids is global . in holography",
    "a superfluid corresponds to a dirichlet condition for the gauge field at the ads boundary , while a true superconductor can be obtained by imposing a boundary condition of the neumann type @xcite .",
    "superfluids can be considered as superconductors in the limit of nondynamical ( electromagnetic ) gauge fields . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we adopt the terminology used in the literature of superconductivity , rather than that of superfluidity .",
    "one of the main motivations for holographic superconductivity is the hope to shed light on high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "experiments indeed imply that these materials can not be entirely described by the weakly coupled theory of bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) , but they could involve strong coupling .",
    "the cuprate high-@xmath4 superconductors can be obtained by doping a mott insulator and in the ( @xmath4 versus `` dopant concentration '' ) phase diagram one can observe an insulator / superconductor transition in the low temperature region @xcite ; therefore the normal ( nonsuperfluid ) phase is expected to be gapped .",
    "a transition of this sort has been realized in holography by considering a theory with a compactified extra dimension @xcite ( see also @xcite for the realization of a true superconductor with a dynamical gauge field ) .",
    "the size of this extra dimension breaks scale invariance and at low temperatures leads to a gap of charged excitations and thus to an insulator normal phase .",
    "one expects to be able to obtain an insulator / sperconductor transition by introducing a dilaton , even in the absence of additional dimensions , because a running dilaton also introduces a scale . we will find that this is indeed the case at low enough temperatures and for some values of the parameters .",
    "let us describe in more detail our main results and the organization of the paper . in section [ model ]",
    "we will define our einstein - dilaton model coupled to the u(1 ) gauge field and the charged scalar and recall the ads / cft dictionary . here and in the rest of the paper we focus on 2 + 1 dimensional cfts . in the same section we will also review the ( recently found @xcite ) most general",
    "static and asymptotically ads planar black hole of the dilaton - gravity system .",
    "once we fix the parameters of the model , there is only one solution with active dilaton ( dilaton - bh ) , but the fact that the space is asymptotically ads implies that the schwarzschild black hole ( s - bh ) , which has @xmath5 , is also a solution .",
    "therefore , in section [ einstein - dilaton section ] , we compare their free energies as a function of @xmath4 to determine which one is energetically favorable .",
    "we find that the s - bh is favorable at high temperatures , while the dilaton - bh dominates in the low temperature region . in the latter phase the dilaton runs logarithmically with the energy and grows from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "we then study the ac and dc conductivity by considering an electromagnetic ( em ) perturbation on top of these geometries .",
    "the presence of a black hole horizon implies that the system is never perfectly insulating , but for some choices of @xmath6 the dc conductivity is suppressed especially at low temperatures , resembling an insulator .",
    "this occurs when the running coupling constant @xmath7 becomes large in the ir and , not surprisingly , links the insulating phase with ir strong coupling .",
    "in section [ homogeneoussfphase ] we find superfluid phase transitions by solving the gauge field and charged scalar equations on the fixed dilaton - bh geometry . like for the s - bh @xcite",
    ", for each value of the temperature and the other parameters there is a critical temperature @xmath8 below which the charged operator condenses breaking the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "we also study the conductivity in the broken phase and obtain that both the gap of charged excitations and the superfluid density are modified by changing the couplings of the dilaton , in particular the running constant , eq .",
    "( [ running - coupling ] ) .",
    "some of the most famous properties of superconductors occur in the presence of external magnetic fields ; therefore we move on and study the magnetic response in the dilaton - bh phase .",
    "the same type of analysis in the model without the dilaton has been performed in @xcite . while for superfluids the external and total magnetic fields coincide , they differ substantially in true superconductors . in section",
    "[ hscs section ] we study the superconductor case .",
    "we directly observe the meissner effect and find vortex solutions , the penetration depth and the critical magnetic fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "like in the case with no dilaton @xcite , we always find @xmath11 ( the superconductor is of type ii ) and thus this seems to be a rather general prediction of holography . quite interestingly , the known high-@xmath4 superconductors are of this type .",
    "crucial differences with respect to the s - bh phase @xcite emerge in the low temperature region , for some choices of @xmath6 ( which , interestingly , lead to an insulating normal phase ) . in these cases the ratio @xmath12 remains finite in the limit of small @xmath0 unlike the s - bh case @xcite and also the penetration depth shows an analogue difference .",
    "finally in section [ superlfuids ] we study superfluids in the presence of external rotations and find superfluid vortices in the dilaton - bh phase ; here we find results that are qualitatively similar to those for the s - bh @xcite , although the dilaton generically modify the vortex shape .",
    "section [ conclusions - section ] contains some outlook of our work .",
    "our model is defined by the usual einstein - dilaton action coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath13 and a charged scalar @xmath14 : s = d^4x \\{116g_n-_^2-|d_|^2 } , [ action ] where @xmath15 is the ricci scalar , @xmath16 the gravitational newton constant , @xmath1 a real scalar ( the dilaton ) and we introduced @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a negative cosmological constant @xmath19 is included in the dilaton potential @xmath20 , and the ads radius is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "we define @xmath1 such that @xmath22 .",
    "also the dilaton couples to @xmath13 and @xmath14 through two generic functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 and we choose the normalization of the matter fields in a way that @xmath25 .",
    "there are no special requirements for the @xmath26 at this level , besides the fact that they should be regular and nonvanishing for any @xmath1 in order for the semiclassical approximation to be valid . for simplicity",
    ", we have not added any potential for the charged scalar .",
    "the most general static asymptotically ads planar black hole with two - dimensional rotation and translation invariance has the form ds^2=w(z)(-f(z)dt^2+dy^2 + ) ,  = ( z ) , [ generalbh ] where @xmath27 represents time , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the holographic coordinate , which we define such that the ads - boundary is located at @xmath30 : for @xmath29 close to zero , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath1 approximate to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this allows us to use the standard ads / cft dictionary , which relates the property of a gravitational theory with those of a cft .",
    "in particular the boundary values of @xmath14 and @xmath36 are the sources of a charged operator @xmath37 and the current @xmath38 in the cft side .",
    "therefore , if one solves the classical field equations with boundary conditions |_z=0=_0 , a_|_z=0=a _ , [ s - amu ] the green s function for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by functional derivatives of the on - shell action with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for example the vacuum expectation values are given by j_=_z|_z=0  ,   = d_z |_z=0 .",
    "[ operator ] we will work in the limit @xmath41 such that the effect of the gauge field and the charged scalar on the metric and the dilaton can be neglected . in this limit the most general asymptotically ads black hole of the form given in eq .",

    "since we want to study the theory at finite temperature , we perform the euclidean continuation to imaginary time @xmath47 with period @xmath48 .",
    "the temperature can then be computed with the formula @xmath49 , where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath50 we have @xmath5 and we recover the s - bh : @xmath51 . in this case @xmath52 and we have @xmath53 .",
    "if instead @xmath54 the dilaton is active and its backreaction on the metric is nontrivial .",
    "this results in a displacement of the horizon and the temperature is no longer given by @xmath55 , but by a more general ( @xmath44-dependent ) expression .",
    "it is important to notice that the s - bh is a solution whenever @xmath56 has a negative stationary point . in order to have the dilaton - bh , @xmath54 ,",
    "one has to consider instead the following family of potentials @xcite v()= _ i=1 ^ 6 v_ie^-_i , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given by v_i&=&3 , 12 , ( 1 + ) , + & & 3 , 4(^2 - 1 ) , ( -1 ) , and _ i= + 1 , 1 , -1 , 1- , -1 , --1 respectively , where the @xmath59 signs correspond to @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; the potential is therefore symmetric under @xmath62 and from now on we restrict to @xmath60 .",
    "since the black hole is asymptotically ads , this potential has a stationary point for @xmath5 such that @xmath63 .",
    "an immediate but important consequence is that one has two black holes for any @xmath54 , the s - bh and the one with active dilaton . for @xmath1 small enough",
    "one obtains @xmath64 .",
    "notice that the squared mass of @xmath1 is always above the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xcite and therefore @xmath5 is never unstable , but either metastable or stable .",
    "in this section we focus on the normal phase , @xmath65 .",
    "this , among other things , will help us to understand what kind of superfluid transitions are those described in the rest of the paper .",
    "let us compare the free energies of the s - bh and the dilaton - bh to determine which one is energetically favorable , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the free energy @xmath66 can be computed by evaluating the euclidean action @xmath67 at the solution of interest , f = s_e.[free - energy ] according to this definition it is clear that the free energy of the s - bh is divergent .",
    "one reason is that the solution does not depend on the planar coordinates y and therefore @xmath66 goes to infinity as the volume of the plane @xmath68 .",
    "this is an infrared divergence and can be avoided by considering the free energy density @xmath69 .",
    "there is , however , another source of singularity , due to the fact that the lagrangian evaluated at the s - bh goes as @xmath70 for @xmath29 small enough and the integral includes the point @xmath30 ; however this is an ultraviolet divergence and as such it should cancel in the difference @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the free energy densities of the dilaton- and s - bh respectively . indeed",
    "the dilaton - bh is asymptotically ads and therefore its ultraviolet behavior should coincide with that of the s - bh .",
    "we plot the free energy difference in fig .",
    "[ phase - transition - d - d - bh ] .",
    "we find that if we lower the temperature below a critical value @xmath74 there is a phase transition between the s - bh and the dilaton - bh . since @xmath75 is the only dimensionful parameter , @xmath76 , but the actual value of @xmath74 depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 as well .",
    "we observe that the entropy , @xmath77 , approximates to zero at small temperatures .",
    "both the s - bh and dilaton - bh phases correspond to systems with nonvanishing conductivity in the cft side .",
    "this property can be viewed essentially as a consequence of the black hole horizon ( see below ) . however , as we will see , the dc conductivity can be suppressed for some values of the parameters , resembling an insulator .    to compute the conductivity",

    "the holographic superconductor in dilaton - gravity shares this feature with the other holographic superconductors studied so far , based on pure einstein gravity , both in ungapped @xcite and gapped @xcite phases , and therefore it seems , at least to some extent , a universal property of holographic superconductivity .",
    "since we are dealing with a type ii superconductor we can conclude that for @xmath172 , but still close enough to @xmath9 , the energetically favorable configuration is the single vortex with @xmath147 , while if @xmath153 increases further , more and more vortices appear until they form a triangular lattice at @xmath173 @xcite .    .",
