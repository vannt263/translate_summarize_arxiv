    "in recent years there has been considerable work on how to define cities and how the different definitions affect the statistical distribution of urban activity  @xcite .",
    "this is a long standing problem in spatial analysis of aggregated data sources , referred to as the ` modifiable areal unit problem ' or the ` ecological fallacy '  @xcite , where different definitions of spatial units based on administrative or governmental boundaries , give rise to inconsistent conclusions with respect to explanations and interpretations of data at different scales .",
    "the conventional method of defining human agglomerations is through the msas  @xcite , which is subject to socio - economical factors .",
    "the msa has been of indubitable importance for the analysis of population growth , and is constructed manually case - by - case based on subjective judgment ( msas are defined starting from a highly populated central area and adding its surrounding counties if they have social or economical ties ) .    in this report , we propose a new way to measure the extent of human agglomerations based on clustering techniques using a fine geographical grid , covering both urban and rural areas . in this view , `` cities '' represent clusters of population , i.e. , adjacent populated geographical spaces .",
    "our algorithm , the `` city clustering algorithm '' ( cca ) , allows for an automated and systematic way of building population clusters based on the geographical location of people .",
    "the cca has one parameter ( the cell size ) that is useful for the study of human agglomerations at different length scales , similar to the level of aggregation in the context of social sciences .",
    "we show that the cca allows for the study of the origin of statistical properties of population growth .",
    "we use the cca to analyze the postulates of gibrat s law of proportional growth applied to cities , which assumes that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rates of cities are constant .",
    "we show that population growth at a fine geographical scale for different urban and regional systems at country and continental levels ( great britain , the usa , and africa ) deviates from gibrat s law .",
    "we find that the mean and standard deviation of population growth rates decrease with population size , in some cases following a power - law behavior .",
    "we argue that the underlying demographic process leading to the deviations from gibrat s law can be modeled from the existence of long - range spatial correlations in the growth of the population , which may arise from the concept that `` development attracts further development . ''",
    "these results have implications for social policies , such as those pertaining to the location of new economic development in cities of different sizes .",
    "the present results imply that , on average , the greatest growth rate occurs in the smallest places where there is the greatest risk of failure ( larger fluctuations ) .",
    "a corollary is that the safest growth occurs in the largest places having less likelihood for rapid growth .",
    "the analyzed data consist of the number of inhabitants , @xmath0 , in each cell @xmath1 of a fine geographical grid at a given time , @xmath2 .",
    "the cell size varies for each data set used in this study .",
    "we consider three different geographic scales : on the smallest scale , the area of study is great britain ( gb : england , scotland and wales ) , a highly urbanized country with population of 58.7 million in 2007 , and an area of 0.23 million km@xmath3 .",
    "the grid is composed of 5.75 million cells of 200m - by-200 m  @xcite . at the intermediate scale ,",
    "we study the usa ( continental usa without alaska ) , a single country nearly continental in scale , with a population of 303 million in 2007 , and an area of 7.44 million km@xmath3 .",
    "the grid contains 7.44 million cells of approximately 1km - by-1 km obtained from the us census bureau @xcite .",
    "the datasets of gb and usa are populated - places datasets , with population counts defined at points in a grid .",
    "since there could be some distortions in the true residential population involved at the finest grid resolution , we perform our analysis by investigating the statistical properties as a function of the grid size by coarse - graining the data as explained in section [ details ] . at the largest scale ,",
    "we analyze the continent of africa , composed of 53 countries with a total population of 933 million in 2007 , and an area of 30.34 million km@xmath3 .",
    "these data are gridded with less resolution by 0.50 million cells of approximately 7.74km - by-7.74 km  @xcite .",
    "more detailed information about these datasets is found in section  [ details ] ( all the datasets studied in this paper are available at http://lev.ccny.cuny.edu/@xmath4hmakse/cities/city_data.zip ) .",
    "figure [ fig1]a illustrates operation of the cca . in order to identify urban clusters ,",
    "we require connected cells to have nonzero population .",
    "we start by selecting an arbitrary populated cell ( final results are independent of the choice of the initial cell ) .",
    "iteratively , we then grow a cluster by adding nearest neighbors of the boundary cells with a population strictly greater than zero , until all neighbors of the boundary are unpopulated .",
    "we repeat this process until all populated cells have been assigned to a cluster .",
    "this technique was introduced to model forest fire dynamics @xcite and is termed the `` burning algorithm , '' since one can think of each populated cell as a burning tree .",
    "the population @xmath5 of cluster @xmath1 at time @xmath2 is the sum of the populations @xmath6 of each cell @xmath7 within it , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of cells in the cluster .",

    "figure [ fig1]c depicts all the clusters of gb , indicating the large variability in their population and size .",

    "@xcite are similar to the clusters obtained with the cca with a cell size of 4km - by-4 km or 8km - by-8 km .",

    "we quantify these processes by measuring the probability distribution of the temporal changes in the clusters for the data of gb .",

    "<S> an important issue in the study of cities is defining a metropolitan area , as different definitions affect conclusions regarding the statistical distribution of urban activity . </S>",
    "<S> a commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the metropolitan statistical areas ( msas ) , based on rules attempting to capture the notion of city as a functional economic region , and is performed using experience . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of msas is a time - consuming process and is typically done only for a subset ( a few hundreds ) of the most highly populated cities . here </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a new method to designate metropolitan areas , denoted `` city clustering algorithm '' ( cca ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cca is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine geographic scale , defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we use the cca to examine gibrat s law of proportional growth , which postulates that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities are constant , independent of city size . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean growth rate of a cluster utilizing the cca exhibits deviations from gibrat s law , and that the standard deviation decreases as a power - law with respect to the city size . </S>",
    "<S> the cca allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations , which are shown to arise from the existence of long - range spatial correlations in population growth . </S>",
    "<S> these results have socio - political implications , for example for the location of new economic development in cities of varied size . </S>"
