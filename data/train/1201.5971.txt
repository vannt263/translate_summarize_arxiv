    "alloying elements with complementary qualities in order to tailor their physical behavior for specific technological purposes has been a major route in material development since the antiquity .",
    "cluster research is no exception to this trend .",
    "after decades of systematic studies of the size and structural dependence of the most wide variety of properties of monoelement particles , the interest has actually been moving progressively over the past years towards investigations on finite - size binary alloys.@xcite the magnetism of transition - metal ( tm ) clusters opens numerous possibilities and challenges in this context .",
    "for example , one would like to understand how to modify the magnetic characteristics of clusters , in particular the saturation magnetization and the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) , as it has been done in solids .",
    "this would indeed allow one to design new nanostructured materials from a microscopic perspective .",
    "nevertheless , it also true that controlling composition , system size , and magnetic behavior sets serious difficulties for both experiment and theory .",
    "pure tm clusters such as fe@xmath7 , co@xmath7 and ni@xmath7 show spin moments , orbital moments , and maes that are enhanced with respect to the corresponding periodic solids.@xcite still , the possibilities of optimizing the cluster magnetic behavior by simply tuning the system size have been rather disappointing , particularly concerning the mae , which remains relatively small despite being orders of magnitude larger than in solids@xcite due to the rather weak spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in the @xmath8 atoms .",
    "this is one of the motivations for alloying @xmath8 tms with @xmath9 and @xmath10 elements which , being heavier , are subject to stronger so interactions . in this context",
    "it is useful to recall that large nanoparticles and three dimensional solids of these elements are non - magnetic .",
    "however , at very small sizes the @xmath9 and @xmath10 clusters often develop a finite spontaneous low - temperature magnetization , due to the reduction of local coordination and the resulting @xmath11-band narrowing.@xcite the first experimental observation of this important finite - size effect has been made by cox _",
    "et al . _ by performing stern - gerlach - deflection measurements on rh@xmath7 clusters . in this work",
    "the average magnetic moments per atom @xmath5 = @xmath12@xmath13 have been experimentally determined for @xmath14@xmath15 atoms.@xcite in view of these contrasting features one expects that @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath8-@xmath10 alloy clusters should show very interesting structural , electronic and magnetic behaviors .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the ground - state properties of the small ferh clusters in the framework of hohenberg - kohn - sham s density functional theory.@xcite besides the general interest of the problem from the perspective of @xmath8-@xmath9 nanomagnetism , these clusters are particularly appealing because of the remarkable phase diagram of ferh bulk alloys.@xcite in the case of @xmath16 the magnetic order at normal pressure and low temperatures is antiferromagnetic ( af ) .",
    "as the temperature increases this @xmath17 phase undergoes a first order transition to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , the @xmath18 phase , which is accompanied by a change in lattice parameter .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature @xmath19 increases rapidly with increasing external pressure p , eventually displacing the fm @xmath18 phase completely for @xmath20  gpa ( @xmath21 for @xmath16 at normal pressure ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 decreases very rapidly with decreasing rh content . at low pressures the fm @xmath18 phase undergoes a fm to paramagnetic ( pm ) transition at ( @xmath22).@xcite in addition ,",
    "the properties of @xmath23-ferh bulk alloys have been the subject of first principles and model theoretical investigations.@xcite in particular these show that the relative stability of the fm and af solutions depends strongly on the interatomic distances .",
    "such remarkable condensed - matter effects enhance the appeal of small ferh particles as specific example of @xmath8-@xmath9 nanoscale alloy .",
    "investigations of their magnetic properties as a function of size , composition , and structure are therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : teo ] the main details of the theoretical background and computational procedure are presented .",
    "this includes in particular a description of the strategy used for exploring the cluster energy landscape as a function of geometrical conformation and chemical order .",
    "the results of our calculations for ferh clusters having @xmath24 atoms are reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : stmagn ] by analyzing the concentration dependence of the cohesive energy , the local and average magnetic moments , and the spin - polarized electronic structure . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : concl ] with a summary of the main trends and an outlook to future extensions .",
    "the calculations reported in this work are based on density functional theory,@xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the exchange and correlation energy is described by using both the spin - polarized local density approximation ( lda ) and perdew and wang s generalized - gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the vasp solves the spin - polarized kohn - sham equations in an augmented plane - wave basis set , taking into account the core electrons within the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite this is an efficient frozen - core all - electron approach which allows to incorporate the proper nodes of the kohn - sham orbitals in the core region and the resulting effects on the electronic structure , total energy and interatomic forces .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath8 orbitals of fe , and the @xmath26 and @xmath9 orbitals of rh are treated as valence states .",
    "the wave functions are expanded in a plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off @xmath27  ev . in order to improve the convergence of the solution of the selfconsistent ks equations the discrete energy levels",
    "are broadened by using a gaussian smearing @xmath28  ev .",
    "the validity of the present choice of computational parameters has been verified.@xcite the paw sphere radii for fe and rh are @xmath29   and @xmath30   , respectively .",
    "a simple cubic supercell is considered with the usual periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the linear size of the cell is @xmath31 = @xmath32@xmath33   , so that any pair of images of the clusters are well separated and the interaction between them is negligible . since we are interested in finite systems , the reciprocal space summations are restricted to the @xmath34 point .",
    "although the potential advantages of alloying magnetic @xmath8 elements with highly - polarizable @xmath9 or @xmath10 elements are easy to understand , the problem involves a number of serious practical challenges .",
    "different growth or synthesis conditions can lead to different chemical orders , which can be governed not just by energetic reasons but by kinetic processes as well .",
    "for instance , one may have to deal with segregated clusters having either a @xmath9 core and a @xmath8 outer shell or vice versa .",
    "post - synthesis manipulations can induce different degrees of intermixing , including for example surface diffusion or disordered alloys .",
    "moreover , the inter atomic distances are also expected to depend strongly on size and composition .",
    "typical tm - cluster bond - lengths are in fact @xmath32@xmath35% smaller than in the corresponding bulk crystals . taking into account that itinerant @xmath36-electron magnetism is most sensitive to the local and chemical environments of the atoms,@xcite it is clear that controlling the distribution of the elements within the cluster is crucial for understanding magnetic nanoalloys .",
    "systematic theoretical studies of binary - metal clusters are hindered by the diversity of geometrical conformations , ordered and disorder arrangements , as well as segregation tendencies that have to be taken into account .",
    "this poses a serious challenge to both first - principles and model approaches . in order to determine the interplay between cluster structure , chemical order and magnetism in ferh clusters we have performed a comprehensive set of electronic calculations for clusters having @xmath37 atoms . in the present paper we focus on the most stable cluster structure and magnetic configuration , which are determined by exploring the ground - state energy landscape.@xcite",
    "this is a formidable task , since one needs to consider a large , most possibly complete and unbiased set of initial structures .",
    "such a thorough geometry optimization must include not only the representative cluster geometries or topologies , but also all relevant chemical orders .",
    "this requires taking into account all distributions of the fe and rh atoms for any given size and composition .",
    "these two aspects of the problem of determining the structure of nanoalloys are discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "the different cluster topologies are sampled by generating all possible graphs for @xmath38 atoms as described in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) . for each graph or adjacency matrix",
    "it is important to verify that it can be represented by a true structure in @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "a graph is acceptable as a cluster structure , only if a set of atomic coordinates @xmath40 with @xmath41 exists , such that the interatomic distances @xmath42 satisfy the conditions @xmath43 if the sites @xmath44 and @xmath45 are connected in the graph ( i.e. , if the adjacency matrix element @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 otherwise ( i.e. , if @xmath48 ) . here",
    "@xmath49 refers to the nearest neighbor ( nn ) distance , which at this stage can be regarded as the unit of length , assuming for simplicity that it is the same for all clusters .",
    "notice that for @xmath50 all graphs are possible cluster structures .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 , the different structures are the tetrahedron , rhombus , square , star , triangular racket and linear chain.@xcite however , for @xmath52 there are graphs , i.e. , topologies , which can not be realized in practice .",
    "for instance , it is not possible to have five atoms being nns from each other in a three dimensional space .",
    "consequently , for @xmath52 there are less real structures than mathematical graphs .",
    "the total number of graphs ( structures ) is 21 ( 20 ) , 112 ( 104 ) , and 853 ( 647 ) for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively.@xcite    for clusters having @xmath55 atoms all these topologies have indeed been taken as starting points of our structural relaxations .",
    "out of this large number of different initial configurations the unconstrained relaxations using vasp lead to only a few geometries , which can be regarded as stable or metastable isomers . for larger clusters ( @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 ) we do not aim at performing a full global optimization .",
    "our purpose here is to explore the interplay between magnetism and chemical order as a function of composition for a few topologies that are representative of open and close - packed structures .",
    "taking into account our results for smaller sizes , and the available information on the structure of pure fe@xmath7 and rh@xmath7 clusters , we have restricted the set of starting topologies for the unconstrained relaxation of ferh heptamers and octamers to the following : bicapped trigonal bipyramid , capped octahedra , and pentagonal bipyramid for @xmath3 , and tricapped trigonal bipyramid , bicapped octahedra , capped pentagonal bipyramid and cube for @xmath56 .",
    "although , the choice of topologies for @xmath3 and @xmath4 is quite restricted , it includes compact as well as more open structures .",
    "therefore , it is expected to shed light on the dependence of the magnetic properties on the chemical order and composition .",
    "the dependence on concentration is investigated systematically for each topology of fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 by varying @xmath59 and for each size @xmath1 , including the pure fe@xmath7 and rh@xmath7 limits .",
    "moreover , we take into account all possible non - equivalent distributions of the @xmath59 fe and @xmath60 rh atoms within the cluster . in this way ,",
    "any _ a priori _ assumption on the chemical order is avoided .",
    "obviously , such an exhaustive combinatorial search increasingly complicates the computational task as we increase the cluster size , and as we move away from pure clusters towards alloys with equal concentrations . finally , in order to perform the actual density - functional calculations we set for simplicity all nn distances in the starting cluster geometry equal to the fe bulk value@xcite @xmath61   .",
    "subsequently , a fully unconstrained geometry optimization is performed from first principles by using the vasp.@xcite the atomic positions are fully relaxed by means of conjugate gradient or quasi - newtonian methods , without imposing any symmetry constraints , until all the force components are smaller than the threshold @xmath62  mev /  .",
    "the convergence criteria are set to @xmath63  ev /  for the energy gradient , and @xmath64   for the atomic displacements.@xcite the same procedure applies to all considered clusters regardless of composition , chemical order , or total magnetic moment .",
    "notice that the diversity of geometrical structures and atomic arrangements often yields many local minima on the ground - state energy surface , which complicates significantly the location of the lowest - energy configuration .",
    "lattice structure and magnetic behavior are intimately related in tms , particularly in weak ferromagnets such as fe and its alloys.@xcite on the one side , the optimum structure and chemical order depend on the actual magnetic state of the cluster as given by the average magnetic moment per atom @xmath5 and the magnetic order . on the other side ,",
    "the magnetic behavior is known to be different for different structures and concentrations .",
    "therefore , in order to rigorously determine the ground - state magnetic properties of ferh clusters , we have varied systematically the value of the total spin polarization of the cluster @xmath65 by performing fixed spin - moment ( fsm ) calculations in the whole physically relevant range .",
    "let us recall that @xmath66 where @xmath67(@xmath68 ) represents the number of electrons in the majority ( minority ) states .",
    "in practice we start from the non - magnetic state ( @xmath69 ) and increase @xmath65 until the local spin moments are fully saturated , i.e. , until the fe moments in the paw sphere reach @xmath70 and the rh moments @xmath71 ( typically , @xmath72 ) .",
    "the above described global geometry optimizations are performed independently for each value of @xmath65 .",
    "these fsm study provides a wealth of information on the isomerization energies , the spin - excitation energies , and their interplay .",
    "these are particularly interesting for a subtle magnetic alloy such as ferh , and would therefore deserve to be analyzed in some more detail . in the present paper we shall focus on the ground - state properties by determining for each considered fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 the most stable structural and magnetic configuration corresponding to energy minimum as a function of @xmath65 and of the atomic positions.@xcite",
    "once the optimization with respect to structural and magnetic degrees of freedom is achieved , we derive the binding energy per atom @xmath73/ n$ ] in the usual way by referring the total energy @xmath74 to the corresponding energy of @xmath59 fe and @xmath60 rh isolated atoms . moreover ,",
    "for each stationary point of the total energy surface ( i.e. , for each relaxed structure having a nearly vanishing @xmath75 ) we determine the vibrational frequencies from the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix .",
    "the latter is calculated from finite differences of the analytic gradients of the total energy . in this way we can rule out saddle points to which the local optimization procedure happens to converge on some occasions .",
    "only configurations which correspond to true minima are discussed in the following . finally , a number of electronic and magnetic properties for example , the binding energy , the local magnetic moments @xmath76 integrated within the wigner - seitz ( ws ) or bader atomic cells of atom @xmath44,@xcite and the spin polarized density of electronic states ( dos ) @xmath77 are derived from the self - consistent spin - polarized density and kohn - sham spectrum .",
    "in the following we present and discuss results for the binding energy , average and local spin moments , and electronic densities of states for @xmath78 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : eb ] the binding energy per atom @xmath79 is given as a function of the number of fe atoms @xmath59 .",
    "besides the expected monotonic increase of @xmath79 with increasing @xmath80 , an interesting concentration dependence is observed .",
    "for very small sizes ( @xmath50 ) @xmath79 is maximal for @xmath81 or @xmath82 , despite the fact that @xmath79 is always larger for pure rh than pure fe clusters .",
    "this indicates that in these cases the bonding resulting from ferh pairs is stronger than rhrh bonds . only for @xmath83 ,",
    "when the number of weaker fefe bonds dominates , one observes that @xmath79 decreases with increasing @xmath59 . for larger sizes ( @xmath52 )",
    "the strength of rhrh and ferh bonds becomes very similar , so that the maximum in @xmath79 is replaced by a range of fe concentrations @xmath84 where @xmath79 depends very weakly on @xmath59 .     of fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 clusters as a function of the number of fe atoms .",

    "this is an expected consequence of the larger fe local moments and the underlying fm - like magnetic order .",
    "the average slope of the curves tends to increase with decreasing @xmath80 , since the change in concentration per fe substitution is more important the smaller the size is .",
    "the typical increase in @xmath5 per fe substitution is about ( @xmath86)@xmath6 per fe substitution .",

    "[ fig : moml ] ) .",
    "this effect can be traced back to a @xmath11 electron charge transfer from fe to rh which , together with the extremely low coordination number , yields a full polarization of the larger number of fe @xmath11 holes . on the other side",
    "the rh moments are not saturated and therefore are more sensitive to size , structure and composition .",

    "this behavior could be related to charge transfers effects leading to changes in the number of rh @xmath11 electrons as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "finally , it is interesting to analyze the role played by magnetism in defining the cluster structure by comparing magnetic and non - magnetic calculations . for the smallest ferh clusters ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) the magnetic energy @xmath102 gained upon magnetization is higher in the first excited isomer than in the most stable structure .",
    "this implies that the contribution of magnetism to the structural stability is not crucial , since the non - magnetic calculations yield the same ordering , at least concerning the two best structures .",
    "this suggests that for the smallest sizes the kinetic or bonding energy dominates the structural stability , which also explains that the two most stable isomers have different topologies .",
    "the situation changes for large clusters . for @xmath52",
    "one finds a number of ferh clusters for which the optimal structure is actually stabilized by magnetism .",
    "for example , in fe@xmath103rh , fe@xmath104rh@xmath105 , and ferh@xmath103 the energy ordering of the two most stable isomers would be reversed if magnetism were neglected .",
    "it should be noted that in these cases the structures differ only in the chemical order , not in the topology which is a tbp . in the ferh",
    "hexamers the energy differences between the low - lying isomers are more important and only in one case , fe@xmath103rh@xmath105 , magnetism appears to be crucial for stabilizing the actual optimal structure . a similar strong interplay between structure , chemical order and magnetism is expected for larger ferh clusters .",
    "it is very interesting to analyze , at least for some representative examples , how the electronic structure depends on the composition of magnetic nanoalloys . to this aim",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] the spin - polarized @xmath11-electron density of states ( dos ) of representative ferh octamers having the most stable relaxed configuration among the considered topologies ( see sec .",

    "in all the clusters , the dominant peaks in the relevant energy range near @xmath107 correspond either to the fe-@xmath8 or to the rh-@xmath9 states .",
    "the valence spectrum is largely dominated by these @xmath11-electron contributions .",
    "in fact the total dos and the @xmath11-projected dos are difficult to tell apart .",
    "first of all , let us consider the dos of the pure clusters .",
    "our results for rh@xmath106 with a cube structure are similar to those of previous studies.@xcite they show the dominant @xmath11-electron contribution near @xmath107 , with the characteristic ferromagnetic exchange splitting between the minority and majority spin states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we also included the dos for rh@xmath106 with a bco structure , since it allows us to illustrate the differences in the electronic structure of compact and open geometries .",

    "these qualitative differences are of course consistent with the fact that fe@xmath106 is a strong ferromagnet with saturated moments , while rh@xmath106 should be regarded as a weak unsaturated ferromagnet .",
    "the trends as a function of concentration reflect the crossover between the previous contrasting behaviors . for low fe concentration ( e.g. , fe@xmath105rh@xmath112 ) we still find states with both spin directions close to @xmath107 .",
    "the magnetic moments are not saturated , although the fermi energy tends to approach the top of the majority band .",
    "moreover , the majority - spin states close to @xmath107 have dominantly rh character .",
    "small fe doping does not reduce the @xmath11-band width significantly . notice the rather important change in the shape of the dos in fe@xmath105rh@xmath112 as compared to the dos in rh@xmath106 .",

    "the first signs of @xmath11-band narrowing and enhanced exchange splitting start to become apparent .",
    "the spin - up states ( majority band ) which in fe@xmath105rh@xmath112 contribute to the dos at @xmath107 now move to lower energies ( 0.3 ev below @xmath107 ) so that the majority band is saturated .",
    "only spin - down ( minority ) states are found around @xmath107 , although there is a significant gap in @xmath113 ( see fig .",

    "the participation of rh ( fe ) is stronger ( weaker ) below @xmath107 and weaker ( stronger ) above @xmath107 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the rh local moments are smaller than the fe moments .",
    "finally , in the fe rich limit ( e.g. , fe@xmath112rh@xmath105 ) , the majority - band width becomes as narrow as in fe@xmath106 , while the minority band is still comparable to rh@xmath106 .",

    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "however , the rh contribution to the minority states below @xmath107 remains above average despite the relative small rh content .",
    "the fe contribution largely dominates the unoccupied minority - spin dos , in agreement with the larger local fe moments .",
    "the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of small fe@xmath57rh@xmath58 clusters having @xmath114 atoms have been investigated systematically in the framework of a generalized gradient approximation to density - functional theory .",
    "for very small sizes ( @xmath50 atoms ) the binding energy @xmath79 shows a non - monotonous dependence on concentration , which implies that the ferh bonds are stronger than the homogeneous ones .",

    "the magnetic order of the clusters having the most stable structures is found to be fm - like .",
    "moreover , the average magnetic moment per atom @xmath5 increases monotonously , which is almost linear over a wide range of concentration with fe content .",
    "consequently , the energy gain @xmath115 associated to magnetism also increases with the number of fe atoms .",
    "the largest part of the spin polarization ( about 90% ) can be traced back to the local @xmath11 magnetic moments within the paw sphere of the atoms .",
    "the @xmath116 and @xmath117 spin polarizations are almost negligible in general .",
    "a remarkable enhancement of the local fe moments is observed as result of rh doping .",
    "this is a consequence of the increase in the number of fe @xmath11 holes , due to charge transfer from fe to rh , combined with the extremely reduced local coordination .",
    "the rh local moments are important already in the pure clusters ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , they are not significantly enhanced by fe doping .",
    "however , the overall stability of magnetism , as measured by the total energy gained by the onset of spin polarization , is found to increase with increasing fe content .",
    "ferh clusters are expected to develop a variety of further interesting behaviors , which still remain to be explored .",
    "for instance , larger cluster should show a more complex dependence of the magnetic order as a function of concentration .",
    "in particular for large rh content one should observe a transition from fm - like to af - like order with increasing cluster size , in agreement with the af phase found in solids for more than 50% rh concentration .",
    "moreover , the metamagnetic transition observed in bulk ferh alloys also puts forward the possibility of similar interesting phenomena in nanoalloys as a function of temperature .",
    "finally , the contributions of orbital magnetism and magnetic anisotropy deserve to be explored in detail as a function of composition and chemical order , even for the smallest sizes , particularly because of their implications for potential applications.@xcite    it is pleasure to thank dr .",

    "increasing the cut - off energy e@xmath118 = 268 ev and supercell size @xmath31 = 12   to e@xmath118 = 500 ev and @xmath31 = 22   in rh@xmath103 increases the computation time by a factor @xmath101@xmath54 .",
    "this yields a total energy differences of 1.75 mev and 0.25 mev , respectively . in the above calculations the changes in average bond length ( bond angle )",
    "amounts to 10@xmath119  ( 10@xmath120 degrees ) .",
    "these difference are not significant for our physical conclusions . in fact , typical isomerization energies in these clusters are an order of magnitude larger , of the order of @xmath32@xmath121 mev .",
    "we also found that the total energy is nearly independent of the choice of the smearing parameter @xmath122 , provided it is not too large ( @xmath122 @xmath123 0.05  ev ) .",
    "values from @xmath122 = 0.01 to 0.1 ev have been checked .",
