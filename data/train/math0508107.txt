    "there are ( at least ) two main approaches to solvable lattice models and their associated quantum spin chains : the bethe ansatz  @xcite and the corner transfer matrix method  @xcite .    in his 1931 paper",
    "@xcite , bethe solved the heisenberg spin chain based on the string hypothesis which asserts that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian form certain strings in the complex plane as the size of the system tends to infinity .",
    "the bethe ansatz has been applied to many models to prove completeness of the bethe vectors .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are indexed by rigged configurations .",
    "however , numerical studies indicate that the string hypothesis is not always true  @xcite .",
    "the corner transfer matrix ( ctm ) method , introduced by baxter  @xcite , labels the eigenvectors by one - dimensional lattice paths .",
    "these lattice paths have a natural interpretation in terms of kashiwara s crystal base theory  @xcite , namely as highest weight crystal elements in a tensor product of finite - dimensional crystals .",
    "even though neither the bethe ansatz nor the corner transfer matrix method are mathematically rigorous , they suggest that the existence of a bijection between the two index sets , namely rigged configurations on the one hand and highest weight crystal paths on the other ( see figure  [ fig : scheme ] ) . for the special case when the spin chain is defined on @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the irreducible @xmath5 representation indexed by the partition @xmath6 for @xmath7 , a bijection between rigged configurations and semi - standard young tableaux was given by kerov , kirillov and reshetikhin  @xcite . this bijection was proven and extended to the case when the @xmath6 are any sequence of rectangles in  @xcite .",
    "the bijection has many amazing properties .",
    "for example it takes the cocharge statistics @xmath8 defined on rigged configurations to the coenergy statistics @xmath9 defined on crystals .",
    "rigged configurations and crystal paths also exist for other types . in  @xcite the existence of kirillov  reshetikhin crystals @xmath10 was conjectured , which can be naturally associated with the dominant weight @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a positive integer and @xmath13 is the @xmath14-th fundamental weight of the underlying algebra of finite type . for a tensor product of kirillov  reshetikhin crystals @xmath15 and a dominant weight @xmath16 let @xmath17 be the set of all highest weight elements of weight @xmath16 in @xmath18 . in the same papers",
    "@xcite , fermionic formulas @xmath19 for the one - dimensional configuration sums",
    "@xmath20 were conjectured .",
    "the fermionic formulas admit a combinatorial interpretation in terms of the set of rigged configurations @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the multiplicity array of @xmath18 ( see section  [ sec : def rc ] ) . a statistic preserving bijection @xmath23 has been proven in various cases  @xcite which implies the following identity @xmath24 since the sets in   are finite , these are polynomials in @xmath2 . when @xmath25 of type @xmath1 , they are none other than the kostka  foulkes polynomials .",
    "rigged configurations corresponding to highest weight crystal paths are only the tip of an iceberg . in this paper",
    "we extend the definition of rigged configurations to all crystal elements in types @xmath0 by the explicit construction of a crystal structure on the set of _ unrestricted _ rigged configurations ( see definition  [ def : crystal ] ) .",
    "the proof uses stembridge s local characterization of simply - laced crystals  @xcite . for nonsimply - laced algebras ,",
    "the local rules provided in  @xcite are still necessary , but no longer sufficient conditions to characterize crystals .",
    "crystal operators for rigged configurations associated to nonsimply - laced algebras can be constructed from the ones presented here via `` folding '' of the dynkin diagrams as in the construction of virtual crystals  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the crystal structures on rigged configurations and crystal paths together with the correspondence for highest weight vectors yields the equality of generating functions in analogy to   ( see theorem  [ thm : bij new ] and corollary  [ cor : x = m ] ) .",
    "denote the unrestricted set of paths and rigged configurations by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding generating functions @xmath28 are unrestricted generalized kostka polynomials or @xmath2-supernomial coefficients . a direct bijection @xmath29 for type @xmath1 along the lines of  @xcite is constructed in  @xcite .",
    "rigged configurations are closely tied to fermionic formulas .",
    "fermionic formulas are explicit expressions for the partition function of the underlying physical model which reflect their particle structure . for more details regarding",
    "the background of fermionic formulas see  @xcite . for type @xmath1",
    "we obtain an explicit characterization of the unrestricted rigged configurations in terms of lower bounds on quantum numbers ( see definition  [ def : extended ] and theorem  [ thm : ext = unres ] ) which yields a new fermionic formula for unrestricted kostka polynomials of type @xmath1 ( see equation  ) .",
    "surprisingly , this formula is different from the fermionic formulas in  @xcite obtained in the special cases of @xmath25 and @xmath30 .",
    "the rigged configurations corresponding to the fermionic formulas of  @xcite were related to ribbon tableaux and the cospin generating functions of lascoux , leclerc , thibon  @xcite in reference  @xcite . to distinguish these rigged configurations from the ones introduced in this paper ,",
    "let us call them ribbon rigged configurations .    the lascoux ",
    "thibon ( llt ) polynomials  @xcite have recently made their debut in the theory of macdonald polynomials in the seminal paper by haiman , haglund , loehr  @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle in obtaining a combinatorial formula for the macdonald ",
    "kostka polynomials is the schur positivity of certain llt polynomials .",
    "a related problem is the conjecture of kirillov and shimozono  @xcite that the cospin generating function of ribbon tableaux equals the generalized kostka polynomial .",
    "a possible avenue to prove this conjecture would be a direct bijection between the unrestricted rigged configurations of this paper and ribbon rigged configurations .    for type @xmath1",
    "we can also describe the affine crystal operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 on rigged configurations ( see section  [ sec : affine ] ) .",
    "a level-@xmath33 restricted element @xmath34 in a crystal @xmath18 is characterized by @xmath35 .",
    "it is striking that the description of the unrestricted rigged configurations of type @xmath1 ( see definition  [ def : extended ] ) is very similar to the characterization of level - restricted rigged configurations as given in  @xcite . instead of a modification of the vacancy numbers , which comprise upper bounds for the quantum numbers , an alteration of the lower bounds occurs .",
    "in both cases the modification is governed by a set of tableaux depending on the weight @xmath16 .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the relation between the conditions imposed by classical restriction and level - restriction in a more precise manner .",
    "one of the motivations for considering unrestricted rigged configurations was takagi s work  @xcite on the inverse scattering transform , which provides a bijection between states in the @xmath36 box ball system and rigged configurations . in this setting rigged configurations",
    "play the role of action - angle variables .",
    "box ball systems can be produced from crystals of solvable lattice models for algebras other than @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the inverse scattering transform can be generalized to the @xmath37 case  @xcite , which should give a box - ball interpretation of the unrestricted rigged configurations presented here .",
    "another motivation for the study of unrestricted configuration sums , fermionic formulas and associated rigged configurations is their appearance in generalizations of the bailey lemma  @xcite .",
    "the andrews ",
    "bailey construction  @xcite relies on an iterative transformation property of the @xmath2-binomial coefficient , which is one of the simplest unrestricted configuration sums , and can be used to prove infinite families of rogers  ramanujan type identities .",
    "the explicit formulas provided in this paper might trigger further progress towards generalizations to higher - rank or other types of the andrews ",
    "bailey construction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : axiom ] we review basics about crystal bases and stembridge s local characterization of crystals . in section  [ sec : rc ] we define rigged configurations and the new crystal structure for types @xmath0 . section  [ sec : type a ] is devoted to type @xmath1 , where we give an explicit characterization of the unrestricted rigged configurations in section  [ sec : lower bound ] , a new fermionic formula for unrestricted kostka polynomials in section  [ sec : fermi ] , and the affine crystal structure in section  [ sec : affine ] .",
