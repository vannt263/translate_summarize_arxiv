    "recently z. y. huang ( [ huang , 4.1 ] ) answered this question affirmatively .",
    "this shows that @xmath11 , in particular @xmath3 , has a strong stability .",

    "however , by the recent work of c. m. ringel [ rin ] there are many cm - finite algebras which are non - gorenstein and not cm - free ( see 2.3 ) .",
    "so it is natural to study @xmath18 also for such algebras .",
    "we prove that for an arbitrary cm - finite algebra @xmath12 , @xmath18 is always cm - free ( theorem [ free ] ) .",
