    "magnetic field suppresses superconductivity , regardless of the pairing symmetry , via the coupling to the orbital motion of electrons in the cooper pairs.@xcite in spin - singlet superconductors , the pairs are also broken by the zeeman interaction of electron spins with an applied field @xmath0 , or by the exchange interaction with localized spins in a magnetic crystal , which is known as the paramagnetic , or pauli , mechanism .",
    "if the orbital effects are neglected , then as shown by larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite and fulde and ferrell@xcite ( loff ) , the competition between the paramagnetic pair breaking and the condensation energy results in the formation at low temperatures of a peculiar non - uniform superconducting state with a periodic modulation of the order parameter , whose critical field @xmath1 exceeds the clogston - chandrasekhar paramagnetic limit for a uniform state.@xcite the superconducting order parameter in the simplest realizations of the loff state is either a single plane wave : @xmath2 , or a superposition of two plane waves : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wave vector of the loff instability . in general",
    ", the order parameter structure can be more complicated and is determined by minimizing the nonlinear ginzburg - landau free energy .    for a long time",
    "the loff state had been considered a theoretical curiosity , because its experimental detection required the fulfillment of some rather stringent conditions .",
    "first , the orbital effects are detrimental to the loff state and therefore should be weak enough .",
    "the relative importance of the orbital and spin pair - breaking mechanisms is measured by the maki parameter @xmath5,@xcite where @xmath6 is the upper critical field in the absence of spin interactions , and @xmath7 is the clogston - chandrasekhar critical field . in the pure paramagnetic limit ,",
    "the orbital pair - breaking is absent altogether and @xmath8 .",
    "the orbital effects were included in the loff model with a spherical fermi surface by gruenberg and gunther,@xcite who found that at @xmath9 and @xmath10 the order parameter below the upper critical field is modulated along the direction of the applied field .",
    "the coordinate dependence of the pair wave function in the transverse directions is described by the lowest landau level , i.e. is the same as in the pure orbital case.@xcite there is another phase transition at a lower field , either into the usual mixed state or into the uniform superconducting state at @xmath8 , resulting in the appearance of a characteristic wedge - like region in the @xmath11 phase diagram at low temperatures and high fields . in most `` classical '' superconductors , however , @xmath12 , so the orbital pair - breaking dominates and the loff state is never realized .    one possible way to reduce the orbital effects",
    "was proposed by bulaevskii,@xcite who pointed out that in a layered superconductor with the electron orbital motion confined to the layers , the maki parameter depends on the angle @xmath13 between the direction of @xmath0 and the layers , making the paramagnetic effects dominant in a narrow angle interval near @xmath14 .",
    "as @xmath13 approaches zero , the system undergoes a series of phase transitions between the loff states corresponding to successive higher landau levels .",
    "the full @xmath11 phase diagram was worked out in ref . .",
    "at the parallel field orientation there is no orbital effects , all pair breaking is entirely paramagnetic , and the region of existence of the non - uniform state turns out to be larger than in the isotropic 3d case , see also ref . .",
    "the same ideas also apply to thin superconducting films,@xcite or to surface superconductors@xcite , in parallel fields .",
    "another obstacle to the experimental realization of the non - uniform state is its sensitivity to the presence of disorder .",
    "it was found by aslamazov@xcite in the isotropic case that the loff critical field decreases rapidly with increasing non - magnetic impurity scattering and eventually becomes smaller than @xmath7 , resulting in the restoration of a first - order phase transition into the uniform superconducting state .",
    "later the analysis was extended to the layered case in ref .",
    ", with essentially the same conclusions .",
    "thus the loff state can potentially be observed only if the superconductor is both paramagnetically limited and sufficiently clean .",
    "these requirements can be simultaneously met in heavy - fermion compounds , in which @xmath6 is inherently high due to a short coherence length .",
    "earlier candidates for hosting the loff state included upd@xmath15al@xmath16,@xcite ube@xmath17,@xcite and ceru@xmath15.@xcite the odds of finding the loff state are even greater in quasi - low - dimensional superconductors , in which the orbital pair breaking is reduced.@xcite several experiments on organic@xcite and cuprate@xcite superconductors have revealed the features in the the @xmath11 phase diagram , such as an upturn of the upper critical field and the presence of an additional phase transition below @xmath18 at low temperatures , that could be interpreted as signatures of the loff state .",
    "similar features have been recently reported in another heavy - fermion compound , cecoin@xmath19.@xcite in all the cases mentioned above , the spin splitting of the electron energies in the cooper pairs was due to the zeeman interaction with an applied magnetic field .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "that the loff state can be created by the intrinsic exchange band splitting in the ferromagnetic superconductor rusr@xmath15gdcu@xmath15o@xmath20 .",
    "another intriguing possibility of the experimental realization of the loff state has been discussed very recently in the context of ultracold atomic fermi gases , such as @xmath21k and @xmath22li . by making the populations of atoms in two different hyperfine",
    "states unequal , one controls the mismatch between their fermi surfaces.@xcite when the pairing interaction between the two fermion species is turned on , the system becomes formally equivalent to a neutral superconductor in a zeeman field . due to the absence of both the orbital effects and impurities",
    ", this seems to be the most promising setup to study the paramagnetic pair breaking , including the non - uniform states.@xcite    despite the lack of unambiguous experimental evidence , the loff state has remained a subject of intensive theoretical investigations in the past decades .",
    "in addition to the studies cited above , we would like to mention refs .",
    ", in which the ginzburg - landau theory was developed in the pure paramagnetic case in the vicinity of the tricritical point in the @xmath11 phase diagram , see fig . 2 below , where the sign change of the second - order gradient term in the free energy signals the onset of the non - uniform instability . the vortex structure in the mixed loff state",
    "was studied in refs . .",
    "the loff model has also been extended to unconventional , in particular @xmath23-wave , pairing symmetries.@xcite an analysis of the spatial structure of the loff state immediately below the upper critical field in the isotropic 3d case was done by larkin and ovchinnikov,@xcite who showed that it is the `` striped '' phase with @xmath3 that is energetically favored at @xmath9 . the zero - temperature phase transition from the normal state",
    "was found to be second order , but becomes first order as temperature increases.@xcite on the other hand , it was argued in refs . that the phase transition is always first order below the tricritical point , and that the order parameter at @xmath9 is represented by a sum of three cosines .",
    "another open question concerns the nature of the lower phase transition separating the loff state from the conventional uniform superconducting state .",
    "the only cases studied so far assumed a one - dimensional periodicity of the order parameter in a purely paramagnetic and isotropic 2d@xcite or 3d@xcite system .",
    "as the field decreases , the non - linear effects add higher harmonics to the loff state , which starts to resemble a periodic array of bloch domain walls separating the regions where the order parameter is almost uniform .",
    "when one approaches the lower critical field , the period of the domain structure diverges , indicating a second order phase transition .",
    "while an extensive literature exists about the mean - field properties of the loff state , the superconducting fluctuation effects have received comparatively little attention .",
    "the phase fluctuations of the non - uniform order parameter were considered by shimahara,@xcite who found that they are able to destroy even the quasi - long - range order for the striped loff states in the isotropic 2d case at @xmath24 .",
    "he also conjectured that in the isotropic 3d case the long - range order is replaced at finite temperatures by a quasi - long - range order .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of ref . , where it was shown that the thermal fluctuations suppress the second order phase transition into the loff state in spatially isotropic systems .",
    "these effects are analogous to the fluctuation - driven destruction of crystalline order with one - dimensional density modulation.@xcite in general , one can expect that , since the wave vectors of important fluctuating modes in the isotropic loff state are close to a sphere ( or a circle in 2d ) of radius @xmath25 , the fluctuation effects on observable quantities will be considerably enhanced compared to the uniform case due to the increased phase volume of the fluctuations.@xcite the fluctuation effects might still be significant even when the degeneracy manifold of the loff states is reduced to a set of isolated points in the momentum space : it was recently argued in ref . that the thermal fluctuations in quasi-2d @xmath23-wave superconductors are strong enough for the loff phase transition to become of first order",
    ".    in all the works mentioned above only finite temperatures were considered , in which case the order parameter fluctuations are predominantly classical .",
    "formally , the classical limit corresponds to setting the frequency in the fluctuation propagator to zero , see sec .",

    "the focus of the present work is on the fluctuation effects at @xmath9 above the quantum phase transition from the normal state to the loff state driven by an external magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the dynamic nature of the superconducting fluctuations can not be neglected .",
    "we assume that the system can be described by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model and also that the quantum loff transition is of second order . we do not include impurities and the orbital effects , expecting our results to be applicable either to paramagnetically limited superconductors , or to the fermi gases of ultracold atoms .",

    "the fluctuation contribution to the quasiparticle decay rate has the energy dependence characteristic of the fermi liquid , and its magnitude can be estimated as follows : @xmath224    on the other hand , if , for some @xmath189 , one of @xmath220 s is zero , then @xmath225 diverges , making the expression ( [ gamma generic fl ] ) inapplicable .",

    "( [ gamma_a gen 3d ] ) , one obtains that the decay rate at @xmath191 is dominated by the contribution from the @xmath132th minimum : @xmath227 so that @xmath228 thus , the following picture emerges : in the generic case , the energy dependence of the quasiparticle decay rate due to the interaction with superconducting fluctuations turns out to be strongly anisotropic on the fermi surface . while @xmath229 is almost everywhere , one has a non - fermi - liquid behavior , @xmath230 , on the lines defined by the intersection of the surfaces @xmath231 with the fermi surface . for the consistency of our calculation we have to assume that these intersection lines do exist , otherwise the coefficient @xmath93 would be zero , see the discussion at the beginning of sec .",

    "similar conclusions can be obtained in the generic 2d case , in which the decay rate has the same form ( [ gamma sum ] ) , where , instead of eq .",

    "although the overall magnitude of the correction is larger than in the generic 3d case , it is still proportional to the small parameter @xmath238",
    ". it is interesting to note that the same frequency dependence of the decay rate can be obtained in the model of a nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid in 2d , where the quasiparticle interaction with spin fluctuations becomes anomalously strong near some points , the `` hot spots '' , on the fermi line.@xcite    let us now compare our results with the decay rate at the second - order phase transition into the uniform superconducting state . setting @xmath182 and assuming an isotropic band dispersion , we have @xmath239 instead of eq .",

    "( [ gamma generic fl ] ) , one obtains : @xmath240 similarly , in the 2d case , @xmath241 thus , the fermi - liquid character of quasiparticle excitations is not destroyed by the quantum fluctuations at the normal metal - to - uniform superconductor transition .",
    "we have studied the order parameter fluctuations near the quantum phase transition at @xmath242 from the normal state to the loff superconducting state .",
    "we derived the general form of the fluctuation propagator @xmath193 at finite @xmath50 and @xmath73 . in the systems suggested as good candidates for the experimental realization of the loff state , disorder is small or absent altogether . in the absence of impurity effects , we analyzed the momentum and frequency dependence of the fluctuation propagator in both isotropic 3d and 2d cases , as well as in the case of generic spectrum .",
    "the fluctuation effects are more pronounced in the isotropic 3d case compared to the generic situation .",
    "this is because in the isotropic case the loff states are infinitely degenerate leading to the large phase volume of fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuation contribution to the spin susceptibility diverges at @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and the quasiparticle decay rate shows a non - fermi - liquid behavior , @xmath245 , at the quantum critical point . the magnitude of the fluctuation corrections is determined by the parameter @xmath246 .",
    "although this ratio is very small in conventional bulk superconductors , it can vary in a wide range in the atomic fermi gases .",
    "it should be noted that our results rely on the assumption that the loff transition at @xmath9 is of second order . as mentioned in the introduction , this might not be the case in clean isotropic systems in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "however , as the ratio @xmath238 grows so do the strong - coupling corrections to the mean - field free energy , which could stabilize the second - order loff transition . more theoretical work is needed to check if this possibility can indeed be realized .    in the generic case , which is expected to be applicable to crystalline paramagnetically - limited superconductors , or to the atomic fermi gases in optical lattices , the equilibrium wave vectors of the loff state form a set of isolated points in the momentum space .",
    "the phase volume of fluctuations is reduced , resulting in a non - singular spin susceptibility in the 3d case , and a weak , logarithmic , divergence of @xmath177 in the 2d case .",
    "interestingly , the fluctuations in the generic case are still strong enough to cause the breakdown of the fermi liquid at the quantum critical point , which manifests itself in a highly anisotropic energy dependence of the quasiparticle decay rate on the fermi surface : @xmath247 on some lines in 3d , and @xmath245 at some points in 2d .",
    "we expect that the fermi - liquid behavior , @xmath248 , will be restored throughout the fermi surface away from the quantum critical point or in the presence of disorder , leaving the details for a future publication .",
    "there is a number of open questions concerning the assumptions we made and the effects we neglected in the present study , the order of the quantum phase transition into the loff state being particularly important .",
    "even if the mean - field transition is of second order , this might no longer be the case if one takes into account the fluctuation renormalization of the free energy .",
    "additional complications arise in realistic crystalline superconductors , in which the orbital effects and disorder should be included .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to extend our calculation of the fluctuation corrections to nonzero temperatures in the critical region around the loff transition .",
