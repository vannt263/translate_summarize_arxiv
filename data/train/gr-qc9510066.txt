    "a multidimensional spacetime is often required by fundamental physics @xcite . from the cosmological point of view , it is interesting to exploit the phenomenology related to the extra space  like dimensions ( the `` internal space '' ) . since",
    "such extra dimensions have not left any trace in the observable universe from the nucleosynthesis onward , the question is what has kept them small and ( almost ) static , _",
    "i.e. _ , how to have a stable compactification . a static solution has been provided using an effective potential with quantum effects @xcite ( _ casimir _ compactification scheme ) or a condensed antisymmetric tensor @xcite ( _ monopole _ compactification scheme ) .",
    "later on , the effective action for quantum effects and its low temperature limit have been evaluated @xcite for more general , non static , backgrounds , of cosmological interest . in a closed cosmological model characterized by two scale factors",
    ", @xmath3 associated to the ordinary 3dimensional space and @xmath4 to the extra dimensions , the general formula for the effective potential assumes a simple expression in the flat ",
    "space limit @xcite @xmath5 .",
    "this is the casimir potential commonly used in literature , which we will make use of in this paper .",
    "the scale factor @xmath4 can be treated as a scalar field , the _ dilaton _ , in a 4dimensional spacetime , under the action of the casimir potential .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for the dilaton field to be an ordinary field , _ i.e. _ , for it to have a canonical kinetic term , an appropriate and unique field redefinition is required .",
    "this point is often neglected in the current literature , but at the price of an intrinsecal instability @xcite .",
    "once the dynamics of the internal space is reduced to that of an ordinary scalar field in four dimensions , one may ask whether the dilaton can drive inflation @xcite in external space .",
    "the answer has been worked out in the casimir @xcite and in the monopole @xcite model . in both cases",
    "the theory includes a cosmological constant .",
    "the resulting potentials , qualitatively very similar , have a local maximum that , for specific , fine tuned , initial conditions , makes possible some sort of inflation .",
    "but , as halliwell @xcite has shown explicitely for the monopole case , and as we will discuss later for the casimir case , the top of the potential is not flat enough for the duration of the inflationary period to be satisfactory .",
    "thus we are forced to introduce another scalar field , the _ inflaton _ , with its own appropriate potential .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , indeed , that in this way , it is possible to have an inflationary stage , without , in the meantime , destroying compactification , provided suitable initial conditions are given .",
    "let us go through this specific model in some detail since it will be adopted also in the present paper .    the model @xcite consists of :    * an @xmath6dimensional universe of topology @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ; * quantum corrections of the casimir type , _",
    "i.e. _ , one  loop vacuum fluctuations of matter fields in a compact space ; * a scalar field @xmath9 driving inflation ; * a multidimensional cosmological constant tuned to ensure that no effective 4dimensional cosmological constant appears .",
    "after dimensional reduction @xcite and field redefinition @xcite , the internal space can be treated as an ordinary scalar field @xmath10 in einstein theory . the whole dynamics ",

    "the @xmath10 field is related to the scalar factor of the internal space @xmath15 through @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the expected present size of the radius of the internal space , corresponding to the static ground state @xmath18 .",
    "such a state exists if one assumes a potential @xmath19 of the casimir type : @xmath20\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath9 field can drive the inflation of external space if we assume an appropriate potential @xmath21 .",
    "for example , in the chaotic inflation scenario , @xmath9 is a `` classical '' field with the u  shaped potential : @xmath22 then the ( total ) potential ( [ potent ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "2 . for sufficiently small initial values of @xmath23",
    ", there exists a channel of stability where the classical universe can undergo an inflationary stage in external space while remaining compactified in internal space ( `` slow rolling '' of the inflaton along the potential in the @xmath9direction ) .",
    "the @xmath9 field ends its evolution with damped oscillations around its ground state @xmath24 , leading the universe to the present friedmannian stage , if one assumes @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    ", we look for inflationary solutions , with particular regard to the scenario described above @xcite , in the framework of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "in fact , through the wave function of the universe @xmath26 we can evaluate the probability of different initial conditions ( although this evaluation is a problem in itself , as we will discuss with some more detail in section  [ sec : iiib ] ) . to find a specific @xmath26 we need solving the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation with a given law of boundary conditions .",
    "two prescriptions are commonly used in literature : the `` no  boundary '' conditions proposed by hartle and hawking @xcite , and vilenkin s `` tunnelling from nothing '' @xcite .",
    "the former have been more widely used , but the latter usually give a larger measure of classical solutions with sufficient inflation @xcite .",
    "therefore ( see also @xcite ) we will consider only vilenkin conditions in this paper .",
    "they can be stated as follows :    * take only the outgoing modes of the wave function at the singular boundary of the superspace ; * impose a finiteness condition on the wave function .    in quantum cosmology",
    "the superspace is the configuration space of the universe ( 3geometries , local configurations of matter fields ) : the classical spacetime corresponds to the region of the superspace in which the wave function oscillates with large phase values .",
    "the non  singular boundary of the superspace is that part of the boundary that includes 3geometries given through a slicing of a regular 4geometry : the rest of the boundary is called `` singular '' .    in many one or two  dimensional minisuperspace models @xcite vilenkin conditions",
    "describe a classical universe that nucleates via a tunnelling from the non  singular boundary of the minisuperspace ( the _ nothing _ ) through the superpotential barrier .",
    "although such a picture does not always hold , the vilenkin wave function still selects inflationary initial conditions for a wide class of models , in @xmath11dimensional cosmology .",
    "in particular , it has success @xcite in the chaotic inflation scenario ( einstein gravity plus chaotic inflaton ) . in this paper",

    "we evaluate the vilenkin wave function in these regions in the wkb limit .",
    "finally , we confirm our results using the method of the constant @xmath46 surfaces , developed by halliwell @xcite .",
    "we now look for the wave function in the region where @xmath27 is _ small _ , _ i.e. _ , under the barrier of superpotential : @xmath47 the wheeler  dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) reduces locally to @xmath48 then eq .

    "we adopt the heuristic method of halliwell @xcite , who neglects the separation constant with respect to the superpotential in the regions of the minisuperspace where the latter is large in modulus .",
    "this is equivalent to assume @xcite that the wave function is asymptotically @xmath9independent , where the superpotential also has this property . indeed , for @xmath53 , values of @xmath27 such that @xmath54 also belong to region ( [ small ] ) .",

    "already in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been pointed out that in models such as non minimally coupled scalar field and bianchi type ",
    "ix , the superpotential barrier can disappear , leaving the configuration of nothing exposed to the lorentzian ( @xmath144 ) region of the minisuperspace .",
    "this fact raises the question of whether one could apply the vilenkin boundary conditions at all .",
    "we have got a similar problem , but in our case the barrier never disappears . in the quantum mechanics analog of the tunnelling , one would expect a nucleation to be more likely where the barrier becomes thinner . in our model ,",
    "the barrier becomes narrow with respect to the external nothing for @xmath145 , _",

    "this proves that the nucleation of the semiclassical universe in one of the two configurations ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) is not possible , while in the standard tunnelling picture they should be equally probable . in this sense",

    "we will argue , following ref .",
    "@xcite ( although , differently from here , there is an exposed nothing in the bianchi type  ix considered there ) , that this is not a real problem . the tunnelling picture in quantum cosmology",
    "was born only as a formal analogy between the vilenkin cosmic wave function and the tunnelling wave function of the usual quantum mechanics .",
    "this analogy is limited to a finite class of models and to particular regions of the superspace .",
    "indeed the superpotential barrier does not always separate classically allowed regions ( _ i.e. _ , where @xmath26 oscillates ) from forbidden ones ( _ i.e. _ , where @xmath26 is monotonic ) in the space of configurations , contrary to the usual potential barrier in quantum mechanics .",
    "this happens because the kinetic form of the gravitational superhamiltonian @xmath151 has a hyperbolic structure , while in a usual quantum system it is elliptic .",
    "so , to changes in sign of the superpotential ( _ i.e. _ , regions of the minisuperspace above and below the barrier ) does not necessarily correspond , in the classical constraint @xmath152 , the fact that real `` velocities '' become imaginary , or viceversa .",
    "the tunnelling analogy can hold only when the kinetic form has a definite sign with respect to the superpotential . in our model",
    ", this does not happen in one of the two configurations where the superpotential barrier becomes narrow , because here the kinetic energy of matter fields is not negligible .",
    "that is to say that @xmath153 gives a relevant contribution in the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) @xmath154 ( @xmath155 operator of the canonical momenta ) .",
    "nevertheless , vilenkin boundary conditions have their physical meaning @xcite that does not depend on the tunnelling analogy . selecting only outgoing modes for the wave function at the singular boundary , oscillates . ]",
    "they fix a `` time direction '' in minisuperspace : the direction of this probability flux toward the boundary . in the following of the paper we will refer to this _ causal meaning _ of vilenkin boundary conditions .",
    "we remark that the causal conditions of quantum cosmology still select an inflationary scenario in 4dimensional models when the tunnelling analogy does not hold anymore : for example , in anisotropic models @xcite .    as a last comment",

    "( [ peak1 ] ) and ( [ int4 ] ) we expect that quantum corrections to the einstein action decrease the probability of local nucleation at high energies @xcite .",
    "the peak of @xmath26 at large @xmath23 could then remain dominant also for @xmath223 .",
    "we remind that the peak at large @xmath23 corresponds to inflationary solutions .",
    "when vilenkin boundary conditions are applied to solving the wheleer - dewitt equation , quantum cosmology predicts a nucleation from nothing of a classical universe in inflationary evolution @xcite . for this reason",
    "we have extended the analysis to an @xmath224dimensional model with topology @xmath225 in the equivalent `` casimir @xmath10dilaton plus chaotic @xmath9inflaton '' scheme of einstein gravity .    in this case , the minisuperspace is 3-dimensional and the tunnelling analogy is no longer valid .",

    "a first consideration is in order . in 2-dimensional minisuperspace models",
    ", this criterion leads to the conclusion that the classical evolution starts at the top ( i.e. the highest point allowed by the semiclassical cut - off ) of the potential of the inflaton field .",
    "our calculations show that this is still true in our 3-dimensional minisuperspace .",
    "however the same criterion can not be extended to the potential of the dilaton @xmath10 .",

    "our main conclusion is that vilenkin wave function predicts inflation , in multidimensional cosmology too .",
    "in fact , at the classical birth of the universe , we find that the law of growth of the ordinary space is @xmath228 , with @xmath229 ( power - law inflation ) .",
    "the inflationary phase is driven by the initially large and almost constant value of the inflaton @xmath9 .",
    "on the contrary , no preferred initial value of the dilaton @xmath10 is selected by the wave function , and @xmath230 .",
    "this means that only a very small subset of the initial conditions leads to an evolution with @xmath10 in the channel of the potential that gives stability to the internal space . in the large majority of the cases , during inflation",
    "the internal space expands . however , the growth of @xmath10 is only logarithmic , _",
    "i.e. _ it is slow enough to make the value of the radius of the internal space at the end of inflation compatible with the known physics .",
