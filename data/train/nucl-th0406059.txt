    "the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule relates the anomalous magnetic moment ( a.m.m . ) of a particle to an energy - weighted integral over its photoabsorption cross sections  @xcite .",
    "this relation bears out that a finite value of the a.m.m . requires the existence of an excitation spectrum , and that both phenomena are simply different aspects of a particle with intrinsic degrees of freedom .",
    "a further property of composite objects is their spatial extension in terms of size and shape , which reveals itself through form factors measured by elastic lepton scattering .",
    "the less known burkhardt - cottingham ( bc ) sum rule connects a particular combination of these form factors to another energy - weighted integral over the total absorption cross sections for virtual photons  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the proton s large a.m.m .",
    "@xcite marked the beginning of hadronic physics .",
    "today , 70 years later , we are still struggling to describe the structure of strongly interacting particles in a quantitative way .",
    "although quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is generally accepted as the underlying theory of the strong interactions , its low - energy aspects are difficult to deal with because of the large coupling constant in that region . however , the low - energy region is the natural habitat of protons and neutrons , and therefore of practically all visible matter in the universe .",
    "a plethora of models have been inspired by qcd , but none can be quantitatively derived from it .",
    "only two descriptions are , in principle , exact realizations of qcd , namely chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and lattice gauge theory .",
    "the former is an expansion in small external momenta and small ( current ) quark masses , and therefore it is limited to the threshold region and to the light @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath1 , and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "the effective degrees of freedom are the goldstone bosons ( quark - antiquark oscillations ) , notably the pions ; all other possible structures are absorbed in contact interactions with `` low - energy constants '' ( lecs ) as proportionality factors .",
    "lattice gauge theory , on the other hand , prescribes how to evaluate the qcd lagrangian numerically on a space - time lattice in terms of quarks and gluons . for computational reasons",
    "the calculations have been mostly performed in the so - called quenched approximation , with only the minimal configuration of three quarks in configuration space . with algorithms such as `` improved actions '' for the light quarks and an increase in computing power by tera - flop machines",
    ", it is slowly becoming possible to include sea - quark degrees of freedom as well .",
    "such effects have proved to be indispensable for an accurate description of hadronic observables  @xcite .    the persistent difficulties in quantitatively understanding nucleon structure",
    "explain why we are interested in a relation like the gdh sum rule .",
    "being based on such general principles as causality , unitarity , and lorentz and gauge invariance , this sum rule should be valid for every model or theory respecting these principles and having a `` reasonable '' high - energy behavior .",
    "therefore , the agreement or disagreement between theoretical predictions and the sum rule provides invaluable information on the quality of the approximations involved and whether or not the relevant degrees of freedom have been included . similarly , if we compare the sum rule value with accurate experimental data for the photoabsorption cross sections up to a certain maximum energy , we learn whether the physics responsible for the a.m.m .",
    "is also the physics of photoproduction to that energy , or whether phenomena at higher energies and possibly new degrees of freedom come into the game .",

    "we use `` natural '' units , @xmath10 , and the nuclear magneton is given by the `` normal '' magnetic moment of the proton , @xmath11 .",
    "we also recall that the ratio between the magnetic moment @xmath4 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath12 of a uniformly charged rotating body is @xmath13 , while the ratio between the `` normal '' magnetic moment @xmath4 and the spin @xmath5 takes twice that value .",
    "this factor is described by the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath14 as predicted from dirac s equation for a spin @xmath15 particle .",
    "according to `` belinfante s conjecture ''  @xcite a particle of general spin @xmath16 should have @xmath17 .",
    "however , ferrara et al .",
    "@xcite have quite convincingly shown that @xmath14 is required for particles of any spin @xmath16 in order to obtain a reasonable high - energy behavior .",
    "the gdh sum rule relates the a.m.m . to the inclusive cross sections @xmath18 and @xmath19 for spherically polarized photons impinging on particles with spin parallel ( p ) or antiparallel ( a ) to the spin or helicity of the photon , [ e2kappa2 ] s = ^__0 ( _ p",
    "( ) - _ a ( ) )  , where the integral runs over the photon energy in the laboratory frame , @xmath20 , from the lowest threshold @xmath21 to infinity . because the left - hand side ( lhs ) of this equation is positive , we can draw the qualitative conclusion that the photon prefers to be absorbed with its spin parallel to the target spin .",
    "of course , the sum rule is much more quantitative .",
    "the same agent that is responsible for the a.m.m . on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) must also lead to an appropriate energy dependence of the helicity difference of the cross sections , @xmath22 , such that the sum rule is fulfilled .",
    "however , keep in mind one caveat : a basic assumption in deriving eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) is that @xmath22 vanishes sufficiently fast such that the integral converges .",
    "having followed through to this point , the reader may well ask whether we can ever be sure that the gdh sum rule is fulfilled . in a sense we can not , because ultimately physical questions can only be answered by experiment , and no experiment will ever decide whether an infinite integral converges or diverges in the mathematical sense .",
    "however , we should view such questions from a more physical standpoint .",
    "first , the gdh sum rule is an ideal testing ground , because the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) is given by ground state properties and , in the case of the nucleon , is known to at least eight decimal places .",
    "the result is @xmath23b for the proton and @xmath24b for the neutron .",
    "thirty years ago , the first estimates for the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) were @xmath25b for the proton and @xmath26b for the neutron  @xcite . over the following years the predictions moved even further away from the sum rule values despite an improving data basis , simply because these data were not sensitive to the helicity difference of the inclusive cross sections .",
    "many explanations for the apparent violation of the sum rule followed , but in view of the more recent experimental evidence we have no intention to deliberate about these models .",
    "instead we recall the arguments of ferrara et al .",
    "@xcite that the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath27 takes its `` natural '' value of 2 for particles of any spin , and that @xmath14 ( at tree level ) is the only value that allows for a reliable perturbative expansion . the large a.m.m",
    "of the nucleon does not invalidate these arguments , because it is due to the composite structure of the proton and neutron , which expresses itself by  among other effects  large unitarity corrections from pion loops . such spatially extended phenomena , however , should not affect the high - energy limit of compton scattering .",
    "indeed , it was observed long ago  @xcite that the requirement of a well - behaved high - energy scattering amplitude implies @xmath14 and points to the existence of an unsubtracted dispersion relation .",
    "as far as composite systems of particles are concerned , brodsky & primack  @xcite showed that the spin - dependent current associated with the c.m .",
    "motion provides the additional interaction terms to verify the gdh sum rule for bound states of any spin .    to further illustrate this point",
    "let us return to the small a.m.m . of the electron , which can be evaluated in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) to 10 decimal places .",
    "since the associated photon - electron loops are spread over a spatial volume of @xmath28  @xmath29 , a photon of a few hundred mev or a wavelength @xmath30  fm will decouple from such a large object . therefore the a.m.m . should not affect the high - energy limit at all and , along the same lines , the a.m.m .",
    "of the electron does not preclude its use as an ideal point particle to study the form factors of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "a footnote in the cited paper of ferrara et al .",
    "@xcite makes room for another interesting idea .",
    "these authors noticed that in a special class of supersymmetric qed , the electron has @xmath14 even after radiative corrections .",
    "in such a completely supersymmetric world , therefore , all gdh integrals would vanish and all particles would be `` truly elementary '' and pointlike objects . the finite value of the a.m.m . in the real world should then be interpreted as a measure of supersymmetry - breaking effects .    for the reasons mentioned above , we can not yet calculate the photoabsorption cross section for hadronic systems from first principles .",
    "however , such calculations have been performed in qed . the lowest order contribution to the a.m.m . of the electron",
    "is the schwinger correction @xmath31 , and altogether the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) is of order @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the rhs must vanish at order @xmath34 , which corresponds to compton scattering at tree level .",
    "the relevant finite terms of order @xmath33 are then provided by radiative corrections to compton scattering , pair production , and photon scattering with the production of a second photon . when the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) was evaluated by numerical integration and compared to the lhs , it was indeed recently shown that the gdh sum rule holds in qed within the numerical errors of less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "in fact it was pointed out many years ago  @xcite that the gdh sum rule should hold at leading order in perturbation theory in the standard model of electroweak interactions . later on this result was generalized to any @xmath35 process in supersymmetric and other field theories  @xcite .",
    "the essential criterion is , of course , that these `` fundamental '' theories start from pointlike particles , and then the gdh sum rule should hold order by order in the coupling constant . in passing we note that the gdh sum rule was also investigated in quantum gravity to one - loop order  @xcite .",
    "the result was a violation of this sum rule , but that may be due to our ignorance of quantum gravity in the strong coupling ( high energy ) region .",
    "the situation is quite different in effective field theories such as chpt  @xcite . in this case",
    "an unsubtracted dispersion relation like eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) will not work , because the theory freezes out the high - energy degrees of freedom in terms of lecs .",
    "we may summarize the situation as follows : in a `` fundamental '' theory such as qed , we can verify eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) order by order in the coupling constant , and if the integral on the rhs converges , it must converge to the value of the lhs to that order . on the other hand , an `` effective '' theory such as chpt",
    "can not decide whether the integral exists ( in fact it will diverge at any given order ) .",
    "instead we must keep subtracting the dispersion relation leading to eq .",
    "( [ e2kappa2 ] ) until it converges , and since the values at the subtraction points have to be expressed by lecs like the a.m.m . , we lose some predictive power .    as discussed in section  2 , the discovery of the large a.m.m . of",
    "the proton indicated that this `` elementary '' particle was a microcosm in itself , and in this sense the findings of stern and collaborators were revolutionary . in the following decades",
    "the understanding of the nucleon s spin structure underwent quite a few crises , and ab initio calculations of the nucleon s a.m.m .",
    "have become possible only recently .    in section  3",
    "we derive the gdh sum rule and related integrals from forward dispersion relations and low energy theorems for compton scattering . as the result of recent experiments , the forward spin polarizability ( fsp ) of the proton",
    "is now known , and the gdh integral is found to agree with the sum rule value within the experimental error bars of @xmath36 .",
    "data have also been taken for the neutron and are under evaluation . with some reservations",
    ", these integrals will be generalized to the scattering of virtual photons in section  4 .",
    "the imaginary parts of the respective integrals are related to the spin - dependent cross sections of electro - excitation and , in the limit of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , to the spin structure functions .",
    "the resulting generalized integrals and polarizabilities depend on the photon s four - momentum and therefore contain information on the spatial distribution of the spin observables .",
    "various gdh - like integrals , the sum rules of bjorken  @xcite , burkhardt - cottingham  @xcite , and wandzura - wilczek  @xcite , the spin polarizabilities , and higher twist expansions are discussed and compared with the experimental data .",

    "@xmath37 of the proton was discovered by otto stern and collaborators  @xcite in 1933 . for the total magnetic moment",
    "@xmath38 they found `` a value between 2 and 3 nuclear magnetons ( not 1 as has been previously expected ) '' .",
    "their findings came as a big surprise to the community , which had just learned that dirac s theory could describe the bohr magneton of the electron so well  @xcite .",
    "the experiment became possible by a continuous improvement of the molecular beam method , with which stern  &  gerlach  @xcite had found the spin of the electron , the first indication that elementary particles may carry internal quantum numbers . though not immediately recognized as such , the new discovery was even more revolutionary : a particle with an a.m.m . can not be a point particle but must have a finite size , and at the same time the finite size requires an excitation spectrum of the particle and vice versa .    shortly after the yukawa particle had been postulated , frhlich et al .",
    "@xcite tried to explain the value of @xmath3 by a pion cloud . in the 1950 s such calculations",

    "right away on the basis of su(3)@xmath39su(6)@xmath40 .",
    "in particular it predicted @xmath41 for the proton to neutron ratio , quite close to the experimental value of -0.937 .",
    "however , this simple picture too had to be discarded .",
    "the analysis of deep inelastic lepton scattering at slac  @xcite and cern  @xcite led to the `` spin crisis '' and taught us that less than half of the nucleon s spin is carried by the quark spins .",
    "but what carries the spin of the nucleon ? on the experimental side , semi - inclusive reactions are expected to answer this question .",
    "in particular , deeply virtual compton scattering or meson production allows us to define generalized parton distributions that hold the promise to disentangle the contributions of quark spin , gluon spin , and orbital angular momentum to the total spin of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "as far as theory is concerned , a combination of lattice calculations and chiral field theory is the most promising approach  @xcite for ab initio calculations on the basis of qcd .",

    "unfortunately , the absolute value in the chiral limit @xmath45 can not be predicted but is determined by the lec @xmath46 , which explains the failure of the early attempts to describe the magnetic moments by pion loops .",
    "however , the steep downward slope at @xmath47 depends only on well - known parameters and is therefore a solid prediction of chpt .",
    "the ellipses in eq .",
    "( [ kappa_v ] ) denote higher order terms , involving in particular two more lecs , which are fitted to the lattice results .",
    "although the matching of the two schemes over a large range of pion masses is not without problems , the figure shows that    * for pion masses above 400  mev @xmath48 reaches only @xmath49 of its experimental value , independent of the exact value of @xmath50 , and * the experimental value @xmath51 is obtained if the pion mass approaches its experimental value , @xmath52  mev , i.e. , if the pion increasingly assumes the properties of a goldstone boson .    therefore , a simple qualitative picture emerges : about half of the a.m.m .",
    "results from degrees of freedom of the quark core , the other half from the pion cloud .",

    "[ ddfig2.2.3 ] ) , i.e. , the background is `` helicity blind '' .",
    "this is quite different from the behavior in the region of dis , where helicity @xmath68 contributions should vanish relative to helicity @xmath15 contributions , because only the latter can be produced by incoherent scattering off a single quark .",
    "obviously the transition from virtual photons to real photons can not be described by a simple extrapolation .",
    "the two helicity cross sections for real photons remain large and roughly equal up to the highest energies , at values of @xmath130b .",
    "therefore we conclude that the real photon is essentially absorbed by coherent processes .",

    "the gdh sum rule predicts that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ ddeq2.2.15 ] ) takes the value @xmath131b for the proton .",
    "as discussed above , the gdh sum rule is based on three very general principles ( lorentz and gauge invariance and unitarity ) and on one weak assumption : the convergence of an unsubtracted dispersion relation .",
    "although this assumption can never be proven or disproven by experiment , it is legitimate to ask whether the a.m.m . on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ ddeq2.2.15 ] ) is approximately obtained by integrating the measured cross sections up to some reasonable energy , say 3 or 50  gev .",
    "this comparison will tell us whether the a.m.m .",
    "measured as a ground state expectation value , is related to the degrees of freedom visible to that energy , or whether it is produced by very short - distance and possibly still unknown phenomena , as we discussed in section  1 .",
    "let us therefore take a closer look at the different energy regions and their contributions to the gdh sum rule :    * the contributions for @xmath132 , below the pion threshold , are only of electromagnetic origin and therefore of relative order @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the schwinger correction to the a.m.m . of the proton .",
    "* the gdh experiments at mami and elsa used longitudinally polarized protons provided by a frozen - spin butanol ( c@xmath135h@xmath136oh ) target .",
    "although the ( spinless ) c and o atoms contained in this target should not affect the helicity difference , they give rise to large backgrounds for @xmath113 and @xmath119 separately . in order to obtain a good statistical accuracy ,",
    "it is therefore a prerequisite to make sure the event happened on a target proton by detecting the emitted pions or the recoil proton under the right kinematical conditions .",

    "the comparison of the data for @xmath483 with the maid results exposes the same problem as already discussed for real photons : the neutron helicity difference in the resonance region is not properly described by the one - pion contribution as constructed from the phase shift analyses , particularly at small values of @xmath398 .",
    "however , the strong curvature at @xmath485  gev@xmath250 and also the predictions for @xmath486  gev@xmath250 agree with the data quite well . at this point",
    "we can only speculate about the missing strength in maid .",
    "the discrepancy seems to be a long - range phenomenon that disappears rapidly with increasing resolution , and it is therefore quite unlikely that dis contributions are responsible .",
    "the remaining candidates are final - state interactions leading to coherent pion production on the @xmath251he target , possible modifications of the multipole expansion for the bound neutron , or a surprisingly large two - pion component in the neutron case .",
    "the integral @xmath487 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ian ]",
    ". it can be easily constructed from the previous results .",
    "this observable deserves particular attention , because it samples the information from the little known longitudinal - transverse cross section . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : i3int ] ) indicates , the convergence of @xmath425 requires that @xmath331 drop faster than @xmath488 at large @xmath20 .",
    "because the longitudinal - transverse interference involves a helicity flip , this is very likely to happen at sufficiently large @xmath20 .",
    "however , there is little experimental information on @xmath331 over the whole energy region , and therefore the phenomenological description is on rather shaky ground .",
    "the zero of @xmath484 in the real photon limit is particularly interesting ( see eq .",
    "( [ i_lt_0 ] ) ) , because it requires a complete cancellation of resonance and dis contributions .",
    "the nice agreement between the new jlab data  @xcite and maid in the resonance region @xmath489  gev ) may be called semi - quantitative , except for the limit @xmath490 where both experimental and theoretical error bars increase .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of dis is large and negative over the full @xmath398 region , which brings the integral much closer to the predicted value at @xmath427 . concerning the chpt calculations  @xcite ,",
    "the zero value at the photon point is of course taken from eq .",
    "( [ i_lt_0 ] ) , but the steep slope is a genuine prediction . in figure  [ fig : ian ] we also show the predictions of the hypercentral constituent quark model  @xcite , which are dominated by the contributions of the @xmath197 resonance . in this model ,",
    "the longitudinal strength of the @xmath197 excitation is very small , and therefore the result for @xmath484 is practically zero over the whole range of @xmath398 .      in the previous section",
    "we have discussed the delicate cancellation between negative and positive contributions to the gdh - like integrals , and in particular the rapid change of the integrals as functions of momentum transfer . in the case of the generalized polarizabilities @xmath491 and @xmath492 , the integrands are weighted by an additional factor @xmath493 or @xmath494 , which enhances the importance of the threshold region relative to resonance excitation , and suppresses the contributions of the dis continuum above @xmath460  gev .    figure  [ fig : gammatt ] shows the fsp @xmath495 and the longitudinal - transverse polarizability @xmath496 ( multiplied by a factor @xmath497 ) as a function of @xmath398 . as in the case of @xmath483 , the preliminary data for @xmath495  @xcite show considerably more strength at small @xmath398 than predicted by maid for the one - pion channel . however , the agreement for @xmath498  gev@xmath250 is again quite satisfactory . in view of the additional weight factor towards the low - energy region ,",
    "this behavior is another indication that the `` neutron problem '' should be related to low - energy and long - range phenomena .    a comparison with the predictions of chpt shows once more that @xmath495 is a particularly sensitive observable .",
    "the phenomenological analysis yields very small values of @xmath499 for both nucleons .",
    "the reason for this is the large cancellation of s - wave pion production ( multipole @xmath242 ) and @xmath197 resonance contributions ( multipole @xmath500 ) , as is immediately apparant in eq .",
    "( [ sigmatt ] ) . because of the additional weight factor @xmath493 , this cancellation is considerably stronger than in the case of the integral @xmath501 .",
    "it is therefore no big surprise that chpt can not describe @xmath499 in a quantitative way .",
    "the @xmath305 and @xmath299 approximations of heavy baryon chpt oscillate from positive to negative values , whereas the fsp at @xmath427 is essentially zero .",
    "also the newly developed lorentz invariant version of chpt misses the real photon point , and the situation improves only slightly if @xmath197 effects are added by the resonance saturation method .",
    "this behavior changes in the case of the longitudinal - transverse polarizability @xmath502 , which is dominated by the s - wave term @xmath503 in the multipole expansion of eq .",
    "( [ sigmalt ] ) . the next term in that expansion , the multipole @xmath504 ,",
    "is essentially saturated by the @xmath311 . however , because of the small ratios @xmath505 and @xmath506 ( see section 4.3 ) , this resonance contribution is very much suppressed .",
    "although the longitudinal strength of the higher resonances is not well known , is is generally agreed to be small . as a consequence @xmath502 decreases rapidly as function of @xmath398 without showing any pronounced resonance structures . in other words ,",
    "the longitudinal - transverse polarization takes place in the outer regions of the nucleon and is mostly due to the pion cloud .",
    "this notion is well supported by the fact that the chpt prediction for @xmath502 is much better than the prediction for @xmath499 .    up to this point",
    "we have concentrated on the polarizabilities , which are defined by the low energy expansion of the vvcs amplitude ( eqs .",

    "( [ ddeq2.3.30],[eq : deltalt],[eq : i1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ d2q2 ] ) , we find that the inelastic contribution to @xmath510 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath512 because @xmath513 , the rhs of this equation is determined by the slopes of the generalized gdh integrals at the real photon point , and therefore @xmath514 can also be predicted by chpt , at least for sufficiently small @xmath398 .",
    "figure  [ d2n ] compares the recent data of the jlab e94 - 010 collaboration  @xcite for @xmath515 to the predictions of maid and heavy baryon chpt  @xcite .",
    "the observed value of order @xmath213 is in agreement with theory . by a similar analysis",
    "one can try to derive a value for the matrix element @xmath508 . concerning the physics of these terms ,",
    "it has been suggested that the matrix elements @xmath510 and @xmath508 describe the response of the color electric and magnetic fields to the polarization of the nucleon , which can be expressed in terms of gluon field polarizabilities  @xcite , d_2 = ( _ e + 2_b )  , f_2 = ( _ e - _ b )  .",

    "@xcite on the basis of the slac data  @xcite .",
    "a more recent phenomenological analysis  @xcite based on all the available proton data has extracted a twist-4 matrix element @xmath516 . from this relation and eq .",
    "( [ polglue ] ) we obtain @xmath517 and @xmath518 .",
    "in particular , the positive value of @xmath508 found in the case of the proton leads to a negative value of @xmath519 , i.e. , color diamagnetism .",
    "the gdh sum rule is one of several dispersive sum rules that connect the real and virtual compton scattering amplitudes to inclusive photo- and electroproduction cross sections .",
    "because these sum rules are based on such universal principles as causality , unitarity , and gauge invariance , they provide a unique testing ground for our understanding of the pertinent degrees of freedom .",
    "recent experiments at mami and elsa have shown a saturation of the gdh sum rule for the proton at photon energies of @xmath235  gev , at least within the experimental errors . the planned slac experiment will measure the helicity cross sections up to 40  gev , which should provide good leverage to test the regge predictions and the convergence of the integral .",
    "what about the neutron sum rule ?",
    "the analysis of the recently taken deuteron data will help to answer this question .",
    "however , the problem of dividing the nuclear response into the contributions of protons and neutrons will persist for some time . in order to resolve this issue firmly",
    ", it will be helpful and maybe even necessary to detect the hadronic final states .",
    "altogether it would be an awkward situation if the sum rule were to be fulfilled for the proton but violated for the neutron .",
    "the generalization of compton scattering to virtual photons opens a wide field .",
    "deep inelastic lepton scattering at cern , hermes , and slac has yielded invaluable information on the spin structure functions and their moments since the beginning of the 1980s . in particular , the bjorken sum rule , a strict prediction of qcd , was found to agree with the data .",
    "however , a complete picture of the spin dynamics in the nucleon requires the measurement of these moments over the full range of momentum transfer , between the limits of coherent and incoherent scattering .",
    "the hall a and b collaborations at jlab have recently provided a rich body of high - quality data at small to intermediate energy transfers , and more data will be forthcoming in the next few years . in this review",
    ", we had to treat these new developments rather cursorily .",
    "let us therefore conclude by pointing out some of the highlights in the field of virtual photons :    * the bc sum rule , derived on the basis of superconvergence , expresses @xmath480 , the first moment of the second spin structure function , in terms of the ground state form factors @xmath520 and @xmath521 .",
    "the data of jlab e94 - 010 support this sum rule within the experimental and model errors .",
    "in contrast to the gdh and bjorken sum rules , this relation should be valid at arbitrary momentum transfer @xmath398 .",
    "* data for @xmath522 will be soon available for both proton and neutron down to very small values of @xmath398 . as a result one",
    "will be able to construct the isovector combination @xmath523 over a large range of momentum transfer .",
    "this may open the possibility to bridge the gap between low - energy ( chpt ) and high - energy ( perturbative qcd ) calculations . *",
    "preliminary data of jlab e94 - 010 exist for the two generalized spin polarizabilitis @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "being functions of the virtuality @xmath398 , these oberservables yield information on the spatial distribution of the polarization densities of charge and magnetization . in the case of the generalized fsp @xmath499 , we observe a delicate cancellation of pion s - wave production and @xmath197 resonance excitation at the real photon point . because of the stronger form factor of the pion cloud contribution , the cancellation becomes less effective at finite @xmath398 , and thus @xmath499 decreases towards a sharp minimum near @xmath524  gev@xmath250 .",
    "the longitudinal - transverse polarizability @xmath502 , on the other hand , is strongly dominated by the pion cloud and therefore drops rapidly with increasing @xmath398 . *",
    "the new precision data in the resonance region allow us to determine the higher twists of perturbative qcd by extrapolations of appropriate observables from intermediate to large @xmath398 .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the case of the twist-3 matrix element @xmath510 , which measures the deviation from the wandzura - wilczek - sum rule .",
    "because such higher twists express the correlations between the quarks due to gluon exchange , they may be interpreted as the gluonic contributions to the polarizability of the nucleon .    in summary , considerable progress has been made in our qualitative understanding of the nucleon s spin structure .",
    "the developments highlighted here cover a broad range from the coherent to the incoherent response of the nucleon . as the virtuality of the photon increases ,",
    "this strongly correlated many - body system is seen through a microscope with better and better resolution , and the pertinent degrees of freedom change from goldstone bosons and collective resonances to those of the primary constituents , the quarks and gluons . over the past years , we have also witnessed a steady improvement of ab initio calculations in the frameworks of chpt , perturbative qcd and lattice qcd .",
    "the wealth of the new data has been both informative and challenging for theory , and we look forward to further experimental and theoretical advances in our quest to understand the nucleon s spin structure in the realm of non - perturbative qcd .",
