    "mean - field models of spin glasses have been extensively studied over the last 30 years @xcite .",
    "the first mean - field model to be studied thoroughly was the sherrington - kirkpatrick @xcite model which exhibits a classical spin glass transition with a continuous transition in the parisi overlap matrix @xmath1 at the transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the full solution to this problem requires continuous replica symmetry breaking @xcite , indicating an extensive number of pure states in the low temperature phase .",
    "mean - field models with multi or @xmath3-spin , interactions exhibit discontinuous jumps in the parisi overlap matrix @xmath1 at the static transition temperature denoted by @xmath4 for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however these systems exhibit a dynamical transition at a temperature @xmath6 indicating the onset of an extensive number of metastable states preceding the static transition .",
    "these models are of particular interest as the scenario of a dynamical transition followed by a static transition is observed in structural glasses @xcite . for this reason the above type of behavior is often referred to as a structural glass transition .",
    "potts type spin glasses can also exhibit first order phase transitions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the study of spin glasses with 2-spin interactions and concentrate on the role of the interaction matrix in determining the nature of the phase transitions in the system .",
    "mean - field spin glass type models appear in a wide range of contexts , they are of course the starting points for studying models of finite dimensional spin glasses but also arise as models of neural networks , formulations of optimization problems and simple models for protein folding .",
    "we shall analyze a class of mean field spin glass models with hamiltonian @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are @xmath9 ising spins .",
    "the interaction matrix @xmath10 is constructed via the following procedure @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a random @xmath0 matrix chosen with the haar measure .",
    "the matrix @xmath13 is diagonal with elements independently chosen from a distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the support of @xmath14 is taken to be finite and independent of @xmath9 , this ensures the existence of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the interest of this kind of model is that one may average over the @xmath0 disorder @xmath12 and then examine the nature of the spin glass phase as a function of the eigenvalue distribution @xmath14 .",
    "in particular we shall show that the way in which @xmath14 vanishes at the maximal value of its support , @xmath15 , determines whether the glass transition is a classical spin glass transition or a structural glass transition .",
    "we show that a finite temperature classical spin glass transition occurs if the same model but with spherically constrained spins ( such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) exhibits a finite temperature phase transition . where this is not the case we study the system using a one step replica symmetry breaking scheme to determine the dynamical transition temperature @xmath18 and the kauzmann temperature @xmath4 .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out to confirm our analytical predictions on this class of models .",
    "we carry out both monte carlo simulations and exact enumeration calculations .",
    "the dynamical transition temperature @xmath18 estimated from simulations agrees well with our analytic calculations .",
    "the exact enumeration carried out on small system sizes confirms the dynamical nature of the transition occurring at @xmath18 .",
    "let us briefly recall some well studied models which fall into the class of spin glass models with interaction matrix given by the form of eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick @xcite ( sk ) model with @xmath10 taken from the gaussian ensemble @xmath19 and @xmath20 independent gaussian random variables of zero mean and with @xmath21 can also can be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) with the wigner semi - circle law @xcite density of eigenvalues given by @xmath22 the squared interaction matrix sk ( simsk ) model studied recently in @xcite has interaction matrix @xmath23 , where the interaction matrix @xmath10 is taken from the gaussian ensemble described above . here",
    "@xmath24 is also of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) .",
    "the density of eigenvalues here is given by @xmath25 in fact the simsk model , at positive temperatures , is equivalent to the hopfield model @xcite with @xmath9 patterns .",
    "this model was shown @xcite to have different behavior at positive and negative temperatures . in the positive temperature hopfield model @xcite ,",
    "the transition is a classical spin glass transition as in the sk model .",
    "however at negative temperature the model has a structural glass transition @xcite .",
    "we also note that the minority game , which is an economics model , is closely related to the negative temperature or antiferromagnetic hopfield model and the same structural glass transition has been remarked @xcite . in both the sk and simsk models",
    "one knows that the eigenvalues of @xmath10 ( the diagonal elements of @xmath13 ) are correlated @xcite , however we will see here that in the thermodynamic limit this correlation seems to be unimportant .",
    "one may also consider the more general hopfield model with interaction matrix @xmath26 where @xmath27 , for @xmath28 of order @xmath29 , is the number of patterns .",
    "the case where @xmath30 are gaussian random variables of zero mean with correlation @xmath31 also falls into the class of models we are considering , as an arbitrary orthogonal transformation @xmath32 gives an element in the same statistical ensemble . here",
    "the density of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath10 is @xcite @xmath33   \\label{doshl1}\\\\ & = & { \\left ( 4\\lambda - ( \\lambda + 1 -\\alpha)^2\\right)^{1\\over2 } \\over 2\\pi\\lambda } \\ \\ { \\rm for } \\",

    "we remark that the density of eigenvalues eq .",
    "( [ doshg1 ] ) when @xmath36 is exactly the same density of eigenvalues as in the simsk model , as expected from our earlier discussion .",
    "another example is the random orthogonal model ( rom ) studied by marinari , parisi and ritort @xcite , where @xmath37 this model was extensively investigated in the case @xmath38 , and was shown to exhibit a structural glass transition .",
    "the case @xmath38 is of particular interest because the high temperature series expansion in this case is equivalent to that of a frustrated mean - field model , the sine model , which has no quenched disorder .",
    "the rom at @xmath38 shows some rather interesting behavior , the static transition temperature @xmath4 is extremely close to the temperature @xmath39 where the annealed entropy vanishes . below the static transition temperature",
    "the energy is almost constant or equivalently the specific heat is nearly zero .",
    "this implies that the rom at @xmath38 is _ almost _ a random energy model ( rem ) at the static level . the simplest version of the rem @xcite is given by considering a system with micro - states having independent energies .",
    "this situation arises by construction in the rem of derrida where there are @xmath40 micro - states @xmath41 of energies @xmath42 each chosen independently from a suitable distribution .",
    "the rem also arises when one considers the @xmath43 limit of @xmath3-spin interaction mean field spin glasses @xcite .",
    "another example is the case of directed polymers on cayley trees with random bond or site disorder @xcite .",
    "although in the directed polymer problem there are correlations between paths , these correlations are weak and the resulting thermodynamics is also rem - like . in this paper",
    "we will show that this rem like behavior is enhanced in the rom model on increasing @xmath28 above @xmath38 .    at a more technical level ,",
    "the problem of averaging over the @xmath0 disorder was solved by marinari et al @xcite by transposing results of itzykson and zuber @xcite ( based on generating function techniques ) , from random matrix theory . for completeness",
    "we also give a simple physical ( though not rigorous ) re - derivation of these averaging results .",
    "we consider the partition function for a model with gaussian spins with a random interaction matrix @xmath10 with density of eigenvalues @xmath44 denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the partition function at @xmath45 is given by    @xmath46    the partition function may be explicitly evaluated , as in the case of the @xmath47 spherical spin glass model @xcite , by passing to the basis of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath10 @xmath48 the gaussian integrals are easily performed yielding @xmath49 thus @xmath50 averaging over the disorder we obtain @xmath51 we will now repeat the same calculation of @xmath52 using the replica method .",
    "one replicates the system @xmath53 times , where we shall consider the limit @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are replica indices . in a model where the interaction matrix is chosen to give an extensive free energy ,",
    "we expect that @xmath57 where tr indicates the matricial trace over the parisi order parameter matrix @xmath58 , and the term n.e.t .",
    "denotes non extensive terms .",

    "one has therefore for a generic @xmath59 @xmath60 we impose the constraint @xmath61 with a fourier representation of the delta function to obtain @xmath62 where the action @xmath63 over the order parameters @xmath64 and @xmath13 is given by @xmath65\\ ] ] the saddle point equations @xmath66 yield the relation @xmath67 thus giving the result @xmath68 \\label{act1}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 indicates that the function in the square brackets is evaluated at an extremal or stationary point . for integer @xmath53",
    "this extremal value is of course the maximum , however in the limit @xmath54 it is often the minimal value that should be taken .",
    "the nature of the stationary point chosen depends on the stability analysis of the hessian matrix at that point .",

    "the action ( [ act1 ] ) can therefore be written in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix of @xmath1 , which by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) must correspond to the possible values of @xmath80 .",

    "hence the extremum taken in eq .",
