    "gps sources are very compact ( @xmath2 ) radio sources with morphologies similar to extended fanaroff & riley i / ii radio sources ( fri / iis ) .",
    "vlbi monitoring of gps sources has shown these sources to expand , implying source ages of @xmath3 years only , and likely to grow out to become fri / iis .",
    "this makes gps sources key objects for studying the early evolution of radio - loud agn , the trigger of their nuclear activity , and the importance of feedback in galaxy evolution .",
    "we investigate the parkes half - jansky sample , consisting of 48 gps galaxies ( snellen et al .",
    "all host galaxies have now been identified and 39 have their redshift determined , which are in the range 0.122 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1.539 ( @xcite ) .",
    "1 shows the hubble diagram of this sample ( solid squares ) .",
    "the new data at z@xmath41 confirm that gps galaxies are on average 1.0 mag fainter in this redshift range than 3c radio galaxies ( open circles ) .",
    "this agrees with the hypothesis that gps galaxies are fainter and redder , due to the lack of the extra , blue light associated with the radio - optical alignment effect . for comparison , a subset of the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; small circles ) sample ( eisenstein et al . 2001 ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are shown .",
    "the lrgs form a volume limited sample of the most luminous , intrinsically red galaxies out to z=0.55 and are thought to represent the most massive early type galaxies , many of which are classified as brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "this figure shows that host galaxies of gps radio sources have similar optical luminosities to lrgs , indicating that powerful young radio sources are hosted by the most massive early type galaxies .",

    "we compare the absolute magnitudes of gps galaxies ( solid squares ) and 3c radio galaxies ( open circles ) to passive evolution models of single burst stellar populations .",
    "fig . 2 ( _ left _ ) shows stellar population models with solar metallicity and different formation redshifts ( @xmath5=1.5 , 2.0 and 3.0 ) .",
    "2 ( _ right _ ) shows models with different metallicities and a formation redshift of @xmath5=1.5 .",
    "our data are in best agreement with a recent formation redshift of 1.5 - 2.0 , with a possible range of metallicities .",
    "however , it would be surprising if the entire host galaxies would have formed so recently , especially because fig .",
    "1 indicates that gps galaxies are massive early type galaxies .",
    "therefore we interpret this result as evidence for recent starburst activity and/or low level agn induced light .",
