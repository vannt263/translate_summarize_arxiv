    "after the measurement of non - zero @xmath2 in recent reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments , we have a well - established standard framework of three - neutrino oscillations , which explains solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation data @xcite by two distinct mass - squared differences ( i.e. , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and three non - zero mixing angles ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 ) . however , there are some short base - line ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation anomalies that can not be explained in the three - neutrino mixing framework : the anomalies found in the lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite accelerator experiments , the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite and the gallium anomaly @xcite .",
    "a neutrino oscillation explanation of these anomalies implies the existence of at least one extra mass - squared difference @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 , and a small mixing of the three active neutrinos with extra sterile neutrino states @xcite .",
    "moreover , analyses @xcite of the data from cosmological observations and big - bang nucleosynthesis may point to the existence of additional dark radiation in the universe , for which light sterile neutrinos are one of the most promising candidates .    the existence of light sterile neutrinos and their mixing with the standard active neutrinos can be tested also by studying their effects in solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrino oscillations , as well as in the processes of the beta decay @xcite and neutrino - less double beta decay @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible effects of active - sterile mixing on the day - night asymmetries of solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "solar neutrinos are produced in the core of the sun and undergo the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism @xcite before they propagate out of the solar surface .",
    "this mechanism was established about ten years ago after the decisive evidences in favor of solar neutrino oscillations obtained in the sno @xcite and kamland @xcite experiments . since then , testing the msw mechanism with low energy solar neutrinos @xcite and searching for sub - leading effects @xcite beyond the standard three - neutrino oscillation have become the central concern of solar neutrino searches . moreover ,",
    "the terrestrial matter effect in terms of the regeneration effects and day - night asymmetries @xcite of solar neutrino oscillations can give direct and independent tests of the msw mechanism and constrain different kinds of sub - leading effects .",
    "different calculations of the day - night asymmetries in the three - neutrino mixing scheme have been discussed in the recent literature @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend the discussion to the general framework with three active and @xmath1 sterile neutrinos ( the @xmath9 scheme ) . in this study",
    ", we derive the analytical expressions of the day - night asymmetries in the @xmath9 mixing scheme without any constraint on the mixing elements , assuming only a realistic hierarchy on the mass - squared differences .",

    "we also illustrate the properties of the day - night asymmetries using the analytical approximations .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] and we present in the appendices additional details of the calculations and the parametrization of the four - neutrino mixing matrix that we use in the examples .",

    "@xcite of the neutrino evolution in matter and the solar neutrino oscillation probabilities in the daytime .    to begin with , the evolution of solar neutrinos propagating in matter ( in the sun or in the earth )",
    "is described by the msw equation@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the flavor transition amplitudes , @xmath12 is the @xmath13 neutrino mixing matrix , and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the neutrino energy and @xmath16 are the mass - squared differences .",

    "( [ eq : hm ] ) between @xmath51 and @xmath52 during their propagation inside the sun .",
    "finally , we obtain the averaged solar neutrino oscillation probabilities in the daytime ( see ref .",

    "in section  [ sec : review ] we have briefly reviewed the derivation of the solar neutrino oscillation probabilities ( [ eq : averp_s ] ) in the daytime .",
    "however , solar neutrino fluxes might be affected by the earth s matter if they are detected at night and travel inside the earth before detection ( the so - called `` regeneration effect '' ) .",
    "therefore , there can be measurable differences of the oscillation probabilities in the daytime and nighttime which can be quantified by defining suitable day - night asymmetries . in the standard framework of three - neutrino mixing",
    ", there is only a single day - night asymmetry for the electron neutrino survival probability @xcite . in the general @xmath0 mixing scheme with three active and @xmath55 sterile neutrinos which we consider there is an additional asymmetry for the electron - to - sterile neutrino transition probability , which can be revealed by precise neutral - current measurements .",
    "because of the spread of the solar neutrino production areas and finite detector energy resolution , the contributions of the different mass eigenstates to the oscillation probabilities are incoherent @xcite . therefore , the oscillation probabilities without [ crossing only the sun ( s ) ] and with [ crossing both the sun ( s ) and the earth ( e ) ] the terrestrial matter effects are given , respectively , by @xmath56 where@xmath57 is the transition probability between @xmath58 and @xmath59 in vacuum . from eq .",

    "it is convenient to define the day - night asymmetries of the oscillation probabilities @xmath65 which depend on the mixing parameter @xmath66 , on the solar oscillations quantities @xmath50 and @xmath67 , and on the regeneration factors @xmath68 in the earth .",
    "note that , taking into account the unitarity of probabilities , the measurable event rates in solar experiments depend on two independent regeneration factors : @xmath69 and @xmath70 . to count the number of relevant mixing angles and cp - violating phases in the regeneration factors",
    ", we can employ the same arguments presented in ref .",
    "because of the freedom in the complex rotations of the @xmath71-@xmath72 sector and among the sterile neutrino flavors , the probability @xmath73 depends on 3@xmath74 + 2 mixing angles and 2@xmath74 dirac cp - violating phases .",
    "in order to express the regeneration factors and the oscillation probabilities in terms of this minimal number of oscillation parameters , it is necessary to choose a convenient parameterization of the mixing matrix .",
    "however , considering for example the 3 + 1 mixing scheme , it is interesting to study the information that solar neutrino measurements can give on the elements @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the mixing matrix , which quantify the mixing of active and sterile neutrinos . therefore , it is convenient to use the parametrization of @xmath12 in eq .",

    "however , such a numerical solution is too time - consuming if one wants to explore a large volume of the space of the mixing - parameters and often one needs analytic expressions for the oscillation probabilities in order to study their properties .",
    "therefore , in the following two subsections , we describe two different approximations which allow us to obtain analytical expressions of @xmath73 .",
    "we discuss the accuracy of these approximations in section  [ sec : numerical ] .      for the density profile inside the earth , the matrix elements of the non - adiabatic hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm ] ) are much smaller than those of the adiabatic hamiltonian and can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the effective potential @xmath34 itself can be treated as a perturbation , because @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , both @xmath46 and @xmath88 are small , even at the boundaries of two adjacent shells in the earth where there are sudden changes of the matter density .    in the @xmath89-matrix formalism",
