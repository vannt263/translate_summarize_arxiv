    "permanent edm is induced by the weak interaction that breaks both the space symmetry inversion and time - reversal invariance ( t ) @xcite .",
    "considerable experimental effort has been invested in measuring atomic edms induced by the edms of proton , neutron and electron and by p , t - odd interactions between them . the best available restriction for the electron edm , @xmath1 ,",
    "was obtained in the atomic tl experiment @xcite , which established an upper limit of @xmath2 cm , where @xmath3 is the charge of the electron .",
    "the benchmark upper limit on a nucleus edm is obtained in atomic experiment on @xmath4hg @xcite , @xmath5 cm , from which the best restriction on the proton edm , @xmath6 cm , was also recently obtained by dmitriev & senkov @xcite .",
    "since 1967 , when sandars suggested to use polar heavy - atom molecules in the experimental search for the proton edm @xcite , the molecules are considered as the most promising objects for such experiments .",
    "sandars also noticed earlier @xcite that the p- and p , t - parity nonconservation ( pnc ) effects are strongly enhanced in heavy - atom systems due to relativistic and other effects .",
    "for example , in paramagnetic atoms the enhancement factor for an electron edm , @xmath7 , is roughly proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fine structure constant , @xmath10 is the nuclear charge and @xmath11 is the atomic polarisability .",
    "it can be of order 100 or greater for highly polarizable heavy atoms ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective inner molecular electric field @xmath13 acting on electrons in polar molecules can be a few orders of magnitude higher than the maximal field @xmath14 accessible in a laboratory , @xmath15 .",
    "the first molecular edm experiment ( on search for the proton edm and other nuclear p , t - odd effects ) was performed on tlf by sandars _",

    "in 1978 the experimental investigation of the electron edm and other pnc effects was further stimulated by labzowsky _",
    "_ @xcite and sushkov & flambaum @xcite who clarified the possibilities of additional enhancement of these effects in diatomic radicals like bis and pbf due to the closeness of levels of opposite parity in @xmath19-doublets having the @xmath20 ground state .",

    "ab  initio _ calculation of pnc effects in pbf initiated by labzowsky was finished in st .- petersburg ( russia ) @xcite .",
    "a few years later , hinds started experimental search for the electron edm on the ybf molecule , on which the first result was obtained by his group in 2002 ( sussex , uk ) @xcite , @xmath22 . though that restriction is worse than the best available now @xmath1 datum calculated from the tl experiment ( see above ) , nevertheless , it is limited by only counting statistics , as hinds _",

    "however , even applying the relativistic scf approximation to heavy - atom molecules when solving the dirac - fock or dirac - fock - breit equations followed by the transformation of the two - electron integrals is not always an easy task because much larger sets of primitive basis functions are required @xcite for such all - electron four - component calculations as compared to the nonrelativistic case .",
    "starting from the pauli approximation and foldy & wouthuysen transformation , many different two - component approaches were developed in which only large components are treated explicitly ( e.g. , see and references ) .",
    "the most computational savings are yet achieved when the two - component relativistic effective core potential ( recp ) approximation proposed by lee _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "there are the following reasons for it .",
    "the recp approach allows one to exclude large number of chemically inactive electrons from molecular calculations and to treat explicitly the valence electrons only .",
    "then , the oscillations of the valence spinors are usually smoothed in heavy - atom cores . as a result",
    ", the number of primitive basis functions can be reduced dramatically .",
    "this approach is based on a well - developed nonrelativistic technique of calculations , however , an effective spin - orbit interaction and other scalar - relativistic effects are taken into account usually by means of radially - local or separable potentials  @xcite .",
    "many complications of the dirac - coulomb(-breit ) molecular calculations @xcite are avoided when employing recps .",
    "the radially - local recp approaches for `` shape - consistent '' ( or `` norm - conserving '' ) pseudoorbitals are the most widely applied in calculations of molecules with heavy elements though `` energy - adjusted / consistent '' pseudopotentials @xcite by stuttgart team and huzinaga - type `` _ ab  initio _ model potentials '' @xcite are also actively used .",
    "( in plane  wave calculations of many - atomic systems and in molecular dynamics , the separable pseudopotentials are more popular now because they provide linear scaling of computational effort on the basis set size . )",
    "the nonrelativistic shape - consistent effective core potential has been first proposed by durand & barthelat @xcite and then a modified scheme of the pseudoorbital constructing was suggested by christiansen _",
    "_ @xcite and by hamann _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite . however , inaccuracy of the conventional radially - local recp approaches reaches 10003000  @xmath26  for the transition and dissociation energies that may be insufficient in practice . in deep reorganization of electronic configuration structure of molecules containing , in particular , transition metals , lanthanides , actinides , and superheavy elements the conventional radially - local recp approaches can not provide reliable results for a wide variety of properties ( as it was shown both in many calculations and theoretically , see @xcite and references ) though otherwise is sometime stated ( e.g. , see  @xcite )",
    "such problems can be efficiently overcomed by applying the generalized recp ( grecp ) approach , that involves both radially - local , separable and huzinaga - type potentials as its components and as particular cases . in the grecp concept , the inner core , outer core and valence electrons",
    "are first treated employing different approximations for each .",
    "nevertheless , calculation of such properties as electronic densities near nuclei , hyperfine structure constants , p , t - parity nonconservation effects , chemical and isotopic shifts etc .  with the help of the two - component pseudospinors smoothed in cores",
    "is impossible . for evaluation the matrix elements of the operators singular on nuclei , proper shapes of the valence molecular four - component spinors",
    "must be restored in atomic core regions after the recp calculation of that molecule performed .    in 1959 , a nonrelativistic procedure of restoration of the orbitals from smoothed phillips ",
    "kleinman pseudoorbitals was proposed @xcite based on the orthogonalization of the latters to the original atomic core orbitals . in 1985 , pacios & christiansen @xcite suggested a modified orthogonalization scheme in the case of shape - consistent pseudospinors .",
    "at the same time , a simple procedure of one - center restoration employing the idea of generation of equivalent basis sets in four - component dirac - fock and two - component recp / scf calculations was proposed in @xcite ( i.e.  nocr procedure , see below ) and first applied to evaluation of the p , t - odd spin - rotational hamiltonian parameters in the pbf molecule . in 1994 ,",
    "similar procedure was used by blchl inside the augmentation regions @xcite in solids to construct the transformation operator between pseudoorbitals ( `` ps '' ) and original orbitals ( `` ae '' ) in his projector augmented - wave method .",
    "all the above restoration schemes can be called by `` nonvariational '' as compared to the `` variational '' one - center restoration ( vocr , see below ) procedure proposed in @xcite .",
    "proper behavior of the molecular orbitals ( four - component spinors in the relativistic case ) in atomic cores of molecules can be restored in the scope of a variational procedure if the molecular pseudoorbitals ( two - component pseudospinors ) match correctly the original orbitals ( large components of bispinors ) in the valence region after the molecular recp calculation .",
    "this condition is rather correct when the shape - consistent recp is involved to the molecular calculation with explicitly treated outermost core orbitals and , especially , when the grecp operator is used as is demonstrated in @xcite .    at the restoration stage ,",
    "a one - center expansion on the spherical harmonics with numerical radial parts is most appropriate both for orbitals ( spinors ) and for the description of `` external '' interactions with respect to the core regions of a considered molecule . in the scope of the discussed two - step methods of the electronic structure calculation of a molecule , finite nucleus models and quantum electrodynamic terms including ,",
    "in particular , two - electron breit interaction @xcite may be used without problems .",
    "one - center expansion had been applied first to whole molecules by desclaux & pyykk in relativistic and nonrelativistic hartree - fock calculations for the series ch@xmath27 to pbh@xmath27 @xcite and then in the dirac - fock calculations of cuh , agh and auh @xcite and other molecules @xcite .",
    "a large bond length contraction due to the relativistic effects has been estimated .",
    "however , the accuracy of such calculations is limited in practice because the orbitals of the hydrogen atom are reexpanded on a heavy nucleus in all the coordinate space .",
    "it is worth to note that the recp and one - center expansion approaches were considered earlier as alternatives to each other @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the proposed two - step algorithms for calculation of wave functions of molecules with heavy atoms is a consequence of the fact that the valence and core electrons may be considered as two subsystems , interaction between which is described mainly by some integrated and not by detailed properties of these subsystems .",
    "the methods for consequent calculation of the valence and core parts of electronic structure of molecules give us a way to combine relative simplicity and accessibility of both molecular recp calculations in gaussian basis set and relativistic finite - difference one - center calculations inside a sphere with the atomic core radius .",
    "the first two - step calculations of the p , t - odd spin - rotational hamiltonian parameters were performed for the pbf radical about 20 years ago @xcite with the semiempirical accounting for the spin - orbit interaction . before ,",
    "only nonrelativistic scf calculation of the tlf molecule using the relativistic scaling was carried out @xcite , in which the p , t - odd values were almost three times underestimated as compared to the relativistic df calculations .",
    "the latter were first performed only in 1997 by laerdahl _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite and by parpia @xcite .",
    "the next two - step calculation , for pbf and hgf molecules @xcite , was carried out with the spin - orbit recp part taken into account using the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "later we performed correlation grecp / nocr calculations of the core properties in ybf @xcite , baf @xcite , again in ybf @xcite and in tlf @xcite . in 1998 ,",

    "the best up to - date accuracy was attained for the hyperfine constants and p , t - odd parameters regarding the molecules containing heavy atoms .",
    "when core electrons of a heavy - atom molecule do not play an active role , the effective hamiltonian with recp can be presented in the form @xmath28 + \\sum_{i_v > j_v } \\frac{1}{r_{i_v j_v}}\\ .",

    "the recp operator simulates , in particular , interactions of the explicitly treated electrons with those which are excluded from the recp calculations . besides , the generalized recp operator @xcite described below can be used that includes the radially - local , separable and huzinaga - type relativistic pseudopotentials as special cases .",
    "additionally , the grecp operator can include terms of other types which are important first of all for economical but precise treatment of transition metals , lanthanides and actinides . with these terms , accuracy provided by grecps can be even higher than the accuracy of the frozen core approximation employing the same separation on subspaces of valence and core electrons @xcite . in  eq .",

    "contrary to the four - component wave function used in dirac - coulomb(-breit ) calculations , the pseudo - wave function in the ( g)recp case can be both two- and one - component .",
    "the use of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) instead of the all - electron relativistic hamiltonians leads to the question about its accuracy .",
    "it was shown both theoretically and in many calculations ( see @xcite and references ) that the usual accuracy of the radially - local recp versions is within 10003000  @xmath26  for transition energies between low - lying states .",
    "the grecp concept is introduced and developed in a series of papers ( see @xcite and references ) .",
    "in contrast to other recp methods , grecp employs the idea of separating the space around a heavy atom into three regions : inner core , outer core and valence , which are treated differently .",
    "it allows one to attain practically any desired accuracy , while requiring moderate computational efforts .",
    "the main steps of the scheme of generating the grecp version with the separable correction taken into account are :    1 .   the numerical all - electron relativistic calculation of a generator state",

    "in the variational technique of the one - center restoration ( vocr ) @xcite , the proper behavior of the four - component molecular spinors in the core regions of heavy atoms can be restored as an expansion on the spherical harmonics inside the sphere with a restoration radius , @xmath76 , that should not be smaller than the matching radius , @xmath77 , used at the recp generation .",

    "some disadvantage of the nocr scheme is that molecular pseudoorbitals are usually computed in a spin - averaged grecp / scf molecular calculation ( i.e.  without accounting for the effective spin - orbit interaction ) and the reexpansion of molecular pseudospinorbitals on one - center atomic pseudospinors is yet restricted by accuracy , as it was seen in our grecp / rcc / nocr calculations @xcite of the tlf molecule ( see below ) . with the restored molecular bispinors , the two - electron integrals on molecular bispinors can be easily calculated when following the scheme presented in  eqs .",
    "( [ 12.1])([12.4 ] ) of the next section ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "thus , the four - component transfomation from the atomic basis that is now the most time - consuming stage of four - component calculations of heavy - atom molecules can be avoided .    however , the most interesting direction in development of the two - step method is the possibility to `` split '' the correlation structure calculation of a molecule on two consequent correlation calculations : first , in the valence region , when the outer core and valence electrons are explicitly involved into the grecp calculation , and then , in the core region , when the outer and inner core space regions are only treated at the restoration stage .",
    "correlation effects in the valence and outer core regions ( not only valence parts of molecular orbitals but also configuration coefficients ) can be calculated , for example , by the grecp / rcc method with very high accuracy .",

    "@xmath78 one can take into account correlation effects in the intermediate region ( outer core in our case ) with the required accuracy .",
    "roughly speaking , the computational efforts for the correlation structure calculations in the core and valence regions are added when using the two - step approach , whereas in the conventional one - step scheme , they have multiplicative nature .",
    "to evaluate one - electron core properties ( hyperfine structure , p , t - odd effects etc . ) employing the above restoraton schemes it is sufficient to obtain the one - particle density matrix , @xmath79 , after the molecular recp calculation on the basis of pseudospinors @xmath80 . at the same time , the matrix elements @xmath81 of the property operator @xmath82 should be calculated on the basis of equivalent four - component spinors @xmath83 .",
    "the mean value for this operator can be then evaluated as @xmath84 the only explicitly treated valence shells are used for evaluating a core property when applying eq .",
    "( [ < w > ] ) since the atomic frozen core ( closed ) shells do not usually contibute to the properties of practical interest .",
    "however , correlations with the core electrons explicitly excluded from the recp calculation can be also taken into account if the effective operator technique @xcite is applied to calculate the property matrix elements @xmath85 on the basis set of bispinors @xmath83 . then , in expression ( [ < w > ] ) one should only replace @xmath81 by @xmath85 .",
    "alternatively , the correlations with the inner core electrons can be , in principle , considered within the variational restoration scheme for electronic structure in the heavy atom cores .",
    "strictly speaking , the use of the effective operators is correct when the molecular calculation is carried out with the `` correlated '' grecp ( see @xcite ) , in which the same correlations with the excluded core electrons are taken into account at the grecp generation as they are in constructing @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , the use of the ( g)recp that does not account for the core correlations at the molecular calculation stage can be justified if they do not influence dramatically on the electronic structure in the valence region .",
    "the latter approximation was applied in calculations of the ybf and baf molecules described in the following section .",
