    "they showed ( see section [ s2 ] below ) that with @xmath8 having all elements equal to @xmath17 , the separation of the largest eigenvalue only occurs for @xmath2 , thus exhibiting a phase transition in @xmath18 .",
    "many year later @xcite , an analogous effect has been exhibited in the general variance laguerre ( also known as wishart ) ensemble .",
    "this ensemble consists of matrices @xmath19 ( wishart matrices ) where the joint distribution on the elements of the @xmath20 @xmath21 matrix @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 covariance matrix , and as such is required to have all eigenvalues positive .",

    "setting of real wigner matrices ( independent entries i.i.d .  with mean @xmath14 and variance @xmath40 ) the distribution of the largest eigenvalue was identified as a gaussian , so generalizing the result of lang . only in recent years did the associated phase transition problem , already known to jones et al .",
    "@xcite , receive attention in the mathematical literature . in the case of the gue , this was due to pech @xcite , while a rigorous study of the goe case can be found in the work of maida @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite by ben arous , baik and pech proved the phase transition property relating to ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the complex case with @xmath24 given by @xmath41 ( ( [ 3.0 ] ) corresponds to @xmath42 ) .",
    "subsequent studies by baik and silverstein @xcite , paul @xcite and bai and yao @xcite considered the real case .",
    "significant for the present study is the result of @xcite , giving that for ( [ 1.2 ] ) with @xmath24 given as above , the separated eigenvalues have the law of the @xmath43 gue .",
    "the case @xmath44not considered here  corresponding to self dual quaternion real matrices , is studied in the recent work of wang @xcite .    the eigenvalue probability density function ( [ 1.1 ] ) is closely related to the dyson brownian motion model @xcite in random matrix theory ( see section 3 below ) .",
    "it is also referred to as a gaussian ensemble with a source . in this context the case of @xmath8 having a finite rank has been studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "however our use of this differs in that we will keep @xmath1 fixed , and exhibit phase separation as a function of the perturbing parameter .",
    "we begin in section 2 by showing how in each case the criteria for separation can be deduced from the eigenvalue equation implied by regarding the parameters @xmath45 as the proportionalities in rank 1 ( or in the case of ( [ 3.1 ] ) , rank 2 ) perturbations . in section 3",

    "the content of section 5 is to exhibit an analogue of eigenvalue separation for the general variance laguerre ensemble , variance matrices of the form ( [ 3.0 ] ) , and its generalization @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "an applied setting is identified in section 6 as a motivation for future work .",
    "consider first the shifted mean gaussian ensemble ( [ 1.1 ] ) , and for definiteness suppose @xmath11 ( @xmath50 real symmetric matrices ) .",
    "the simplest case is when all elements of @xmath51 are constant , equal to @xmath14 say .",
    "then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a column vector with all entries equal to 1 , and @xmath10 is a member of the ( zero mean ) gaussian orthogonal ensemble . diagonalizing @xmath10 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and using the fact that @xmath56 is distributed as a standard gaussian vector shows that from the viewpoint of the eigenvalues , the right hand side of ( [ hax ] ) can be replaced by @xmath57 .",
    "we seek the eigenvalues of this matrix @xcite .",
    "[ p1.18sm ] the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath58 are given by the zeros of the solution of the secular equation ( for the use of this terminology , see @xcite ) @xmath59 assuming the ordering @xmath60 , and that @xmath61 , a corollary of this is that the eigenvalues satisfy the interlacing @xmath62    _ proof . _ with @xmath63 we have @xmath64 the matrix product in the second determinant has rank 1 and so @xmath65 the characteristic polynomial ( [ 1.dah ] ) vanishes at the zeros of this determinant , but not at the zeros of @xmath66 due to the cancellation with the poles in ( [ 1.dah1 ] ) .",
    "thus the condition for the eigenvalues is the secular equation ( [ 1.dam ] ) .",
    "the interlacing condition can be seen by sketching a graph , taking into consideration the requirement @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68    we are interested in the position of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath69 or equivalently @xmath6 as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath1 , which unlike the other eigenvalues is not trapped by the eigenvalues of @xmath70 .",
    "following @xcite , to do this requires using the wigner semi - circle law for the eigenvalue density of gaussian orthogonal ensemble matrices , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "thus in ( [ 1.dam ] ) we begin by averaging over the components of the eigenvectors and thus replacing each @xmath73 by its mean value unity . because the density of @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 , for large @xmath1 ( [ 1.dam ] )",
    "then assumes the form of an integral equation , @xmath76 we seek a solution of this equation for @xmath77 .",
    "now , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 but it is well known ( see @xcite ) , and can readily be checked directly , that @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the @xmath47-th catalan number . substituting ( [ 3.dyb2 ] ) in ( [ 3.dyb1 ] ) , and using the generating function for the catalan numbers @xmath81 we deduce the integral evaluation @xmath82 substituting this in ( [ 3.dyb ] ) shows a solution with @xmath77 is only possible for @xmath83 , and furthermore allows the location of the separated eigenvalue to be specified .",

    "a single eigenvalue separates from the eigenvalue support in the case @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and is located at @xmath87    the case of the shifted mean gaussian ensemble ( [ 1.1 ] ) with @xmath26 ( @xmath50 complex hermitian matrices ) and all elements of @xmath51 constant , is very similar . with @xmath10 a ( zero mean ) member of the gaussian unitary ensemble , the shifted mean matrices have the same eigenvalues distribution as the random rank 1 perturbation @xmath88 where @xmath53 is an @xmath89-component standard complex gaussian vector .",
    "thus with @xmath73 replaced by @xmath90 the secular equation ( [ 1.dam ] ) again specifies the eigenvalues .",
    "since the mean of @xmath90 is unity , and the eigenvalue density of gaussian unity ensemble matrices is again given by the wigner semi - circle law ( [ ws ] ) , all details of the working leading to proposition [ p.jk ] remain valid , and so the proposition itself remains valid for shifted mean unitary ensemble matrices .",
    "we turn our attention next to correlated wishart matrices ( [ 1.2a ] ) , and consider for definiteness the complex case @xmath26 . to begin we make use of the general fact that the non - zero eigenvalues of the matrix products @xmath91 and @xmath92 are equal .",
