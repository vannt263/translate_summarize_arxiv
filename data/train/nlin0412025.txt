    "this process may continue until the inverse - transfer range eventually exceeds the @xmath130 threshold . because of the high degrees of viscosity , such a slope steepening causes insignificant increase in the dissipation of @xmath5 . as a result , a positive growth rate @xmath204 could be maintained for a steeper - than-@xmath130 inverse - transfer range , which might then be able to support a persistent inverse cascade .",
    "in this paper , the advective transfer of sqg turbulence is studied .",
    "the main result obtained is an upper bound for the inverse flux of the inverse - cascading candidate @xmath5 .",
    "this upper bound diminishes as the flux proceeds toward sufficiently low wavenumbers , thereby ruling out the existence of a persistent inverse cascade .",
    "the unrealizability of an inverse cascade entails that there is no direct cascade .",
    "this is the first rigorous example of the dynamics of incompressible fluids in two dimensions that exhibits no cascades .",
    "there are two essential features of sqg turbulence that facilitate the proof of non - cascading dynamics .",
    "first , the inverse flux of @xmath5 across a low wavenumber @xmath46 can be uniformly ( in time ) estimated in terms of the kinetic energy @xmath4 and of @xmath205 , the large - scale energy associated with the low - wavenumber region @xmath63 .",
    "second , the energy @xmath4 remains bounded in the limit of infinite domain .",
    "the former is an intrinsic property of the advective nonlinear term , and the latter is due to the hypoviscous nature of the dissipation of sqg dynamics .",
    "the boundedness of energy means that if the turbulence is driven at some fixed energy density rate around some fixed wavenumber @xmath27 , virtually no energy can be acquired by wavenumbers @xmath44 .",
    "this means that in the limit @xmath47 , @xmath205 can become arbitrarily small , leading to an arbitrarily small inverse flux of @xmath5 across @xmath46 .",
    "hence , for sufficiently low wavenumber @xmath46 no significant inverse transfer of @xmath5 across @xmath46 is possible .",
    "numerical simulations of sqg turbulence were performed .",
    "the results show no significant inverse transfer of @xmath5 to the large scales , thereby lending strong support to the prediction of no cascades .",
    "the large - scale energy spectra are shallower than @xmath130 , and the small - scale spectra are steeper than @xmath206 , consistent with the theoretical prediction",
