    "strongly correlated two - dimensional quantum coulomb systems are the subject of intensive discussions . in particular , it is known that the competition between electrostatic and kinetic energy in an electron gas may be the reason of an unusual phase diagram of a 2d system of electrons .",
    "the liquid state of such system is stable when the kinetic energy dominates while the electrostatically favored `` wigner '' triangular crystal is stable in the opposite case .",
    "if there is a strong competition between these two kinds of energy , different situations are possible .",
    "the question under discussion is the existence of the intermediate anisotropic liquid phase ( hexatic ) under melting of crystal into isotropic liquid .",
    "moreover , the physical mechanism of melting can be influenced by the interaction with substrate and defects .",
    "currently all mentioned phenomena can be extensively investigated by a consistent first - principle numerical simulation , and in this brief paper we present the most interesting results of our numerical experiments by the direct pimc method .",
    "let us consider a two - component neutral e - h plasma .",
    "thermodynamic properties of such plasma are defined by the partition function @xmath0 , which for the case of @xmath1 electrons and @xmath2 holes ( @xmath3 ) , is given by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 denotes the space and spin electron coordinates , while @xmath10 denotes the space and spin hole coordinates .",
    "these expressions are valid for 1d , 2d and 3d cases .",
    "the pair distribution functions for a binary mixture of quantum electrons and holes can be written in the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 label the particle species , i.e. @xmath14 ( electrons ) , @xmath15 ( holes ) and @xmath16 denote the two - dimensional vectors of coordinates , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the exact density matrix @xmath19 of a quantum system for low temperature and high density is in general not known but can be constructed using a path integral representation @xcite .",
    "thus we take into account interaction , exchange ( through permutation operators ) and spin effects both for electrons and holes .",
    "this procedure gives the expression for the density matrix as a multiple integral which is well suited for efficient numerical evaluation by monte carlo techniques ,",
    "e.g. @xcite . we mention here that for all obtained results , the maximum statistical and systematic errors is not more than @xmath20 .",
    "we are interested in strong coulomb correlation effects such as bound state ( excitons , bi - excitons , many particle clusters ) , their transformation by the surrounding plasma and their eventual breakup at high densities ( mott effect ) . beyond the mott density",
    ", we expect the possibility of the hole crystallization if the hole mass is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "below , the density of the two - component plasma is characterized by the brueckner parameter @xmath21 defined as the ratio of the mean distance between particles @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] and the 3d exciton bohr radius @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electron and hole 2d densities .",
    "the dimensionless temperature will be presented as a ratio of the temperature and the 3d electron - hole binding energy ( rydberg ) , which includes the reduced effective mass and dielectric constant .",

    "each electron and hole is represented by several tens of points ( `` beads '' ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the beads of each quantum particle is proportional to its spatial probability distribution .",
    "shows that , the typical size of the cloud of beads for electrons is several times larger than the one for the heavy holes . at low temperature and low ( @xmath30 ) and middle ( @xmath31 ) densities",
    "practically all holes are closely covered by electron beads . from a physical point of view",
    "this means that electrons and holes form bound states , i.e. excitons , bi - excitons and many particle clusters .",
    "the existence of the bound states is also supported by the behavior of the pair distribution functions , exhibiting pronounced maxima at the distances of about half and a bit more of the bohr radius .",
    "we note that raising the temperature at a fixed density leads to a temperature - induced ionization of the bound states . as a result we found a substantial number of free electrons and holes .    from it follows that the growth of density results in the increase of the number of particles in clusters .",
    "the structural analysis of large many - particle clusters show the hexagonal ordering of heavy holes inside liquid - like clusters ( lower right panel ) . in this panel",
    "there are only two clusters : one is in the center of the monte carlo cell , while the second one is divided in four parts ( in each corner ) due to the periodic boundary conditions of the monte carlo cell . here besides the inner normal hexagonal structure the holes due to the strong coulomb repulsion form the filament - like structures of the clouds of beads at the bounds of clusters .",
    "the filament - like structures are fully 2d topological effect as in 3d case the holes in analogous many particles clusters have normal liquid - like ordering @xcite .    if the particle density is high enough ( @xmath33 ) the electron wavelength becomes larger than the mean inter - particle distance @xmath34 and even larger than the size of the monte carlo cell which is seen by the large extension of the clouds of electron beads . for @xmath35 clusters",
    "become unstable because two electrons bounded to neighboring holes start to overlap allowing for electron tunneling from one cluster to the other ( mott effect ) .",
    "since the hole wave - length is significantly smaller than the electron wavelength , it may still be smaller than @xmath34 and the structure of the hole beads resembles a liquid - like or crystal - like state .",
    "if the hole mass exceeds a critical value , the holes may even form a crystal - like structure @xcite ( lower right panel in ) . here the holes form a crystal - like structure , while the electron density demonstrates the bloch oscillations . at this very high density",
    "the type of the hole crystal is influenced by the boundary conditions of the monte carlo cell ( finite size effect ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of the type of the crystal - like structure is possible for a much more bigger number of particles in the monte carlo cell .    , the hole - to - electron mass ratio @xmath29 and densities related to the brueckner parameter @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",

    "in this paper we have presented a computer simulation analysis of strong coulomb correlations in dense two - dimensional two - component quantum plasmas at low temperatures . in particular , the formation and dissociation of bound states , such as excitons , bi - excitons and many particle clusters , is analyzed and the density - temperature regions of their occurrence is identified .",
    "we have shown that , above the mott point , two - component plasmas with large mass anisotropy show interesting coulomb correlation phenomena : with increasing density holes can undergo a phase transition to a coulomb hexatic - like liquid and to a wigner crystal which are embedded into a degenerate electron gas .",
    "the crystal - like formation in a two - component plasma is possible for large enough hole - to - electron mass ratios @xcite .",
