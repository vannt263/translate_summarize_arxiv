    "spin transport electronics or spintronics in semiconductors has become a very active research field in condensed matter mainly because of its potential applications in information storage and processing and other electronic technologies  @xcite and also because of many fundamental questions on the physics of electron spin  @xcite .",
    "spin current generation is an important issue in the emerging spintronics .",
    "recent proposals of the intrinsic spin hall effect are therefore remarkable  @xcite . in the spin hall effect ,",
    "a transverse spin current is generated in response to an electric field in a metal with relativistic electron interaction ( spin - orbit coupling ) .",
    "this effect has been considered to arise extrinsically , i.e. , by impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "the scattering becomes spin - dependent in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , and this gives rise to the spin hall effect .",
    "in the recent proposals , in contrast , the spin hall effect can arise intrinsically in hole - doped ( @xmath0-type ) bulk semiconductors  @xcite and also in electron - doped ( @xmath1-type ) semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite due to intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in the band structure .",
    "this intrinsic spin hall effect offers an exciting possibility of pure electric driven spintronics in semiconductors , where spin - orbit coupling is relatively strong and which can be more readily integrated with well - developed semiconductor electronics .",
    "a large number of theoretical papers have been written addressing various issues about the intrinsic spin hall effect . in @xcite , a systematic semi - classical theory of spin transport",
    "is presented , resolving a discrepancy between the prediction of @xcite and the kubo formula result . in @xcite , an orbital - angular - momentum ( oam ) hall current",
    "is predicted to exist in response to an electric field and is found to cancel exactly the spin hall current in the spin hall effect . in @xcite , however , _ ab inito _ relativistic band structure calculations show that the oam hall conductivity in hole - doped semiconductors is one order of magnitude smaller than the spin hall conductivity , indicating no cancellation between the spin and oam hall effects in bulk semiconductors because of the orbital quenching by the cubic crystalline anisotropy .",
    "there is also an intensive debate about whether the intrinsic spin hall effect remains valid beyond the ballistic transport regime @xcite . on the other hand , experimental measurements of large spin hall effects for the rashba two dimensional electron gas and for @xmath1-type bulk semiconductors",
    "have just been reported  @xcite , although more work is needed to firmly establish the intrinsic or extrinsic nature of the results .    at present ,",
    "an urgent current issue in spintronics research is about the appropriate definition of the spin current  @xcite . in almost all previous studies of the intrinsic spin hall effect , the spin current is intuitively defined as the expectation value of the spin and velocity operators , namely , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the anticommutator defined by @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the oam current is defined as the expectation value of @xmath5 . here ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the z - component of spin and oam operators , respectively , and @xmath8 is the velocity operator .",
    "however , this conventionally defined spin ( oam ) current is not conserved in systems with spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "consequently , many fundamental questions on the intrinsic spin hall effect in semiconductors remain unresolved . very recently , in ref . , a proper definition of the conserved effective spin current is established for systems with spin - orbit coupling , and the conserved spin current density is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 $ ] is conventional spin current density and @xmath11 is the torque dipole density which arise from spin torque @xmath12\\psi]$ ] where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the commutator @xmath14 $ ] is defined by @xmath15=ab - ba$ ] . the effective spin current density @xmath16 then satisfies the standard continuity equation  @xcite of @xmath17 where the spin density is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "a derivation of the effective spin continuity equation in rashba - dresselhaus system is given in appendix a. within this definition of the effective spin current , the unphysical intrinsic spin hall effect in insulators with localized orbitals vanishes , and the onsager relation between the spin hall effect and inverse spin hall effect is ensured .",
    "@xcite furthermore , this new definition of the spin current predicts opposite signs of spin hall coefficients for a couple of semiconductor models such as the rashba and @xmath19-cubed rashba hamiltonians .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we extend the theory proposed in ref . to two - dimensional electron systems with both rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the concept of the effective oam current by including an oam torque correction term , and investigate the oam hall effect in both pure rashba system and systems with rashba - dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we derive the effective oam continuity equation for the rashba - dresselhaus system ( appendix b ) .",
    "also in this paper , we argue that in a pure rashba system , though the oam hall conductivity is found to exactly cancel the spin hall conductivity , there nevertheless would be nonzero magnetization current and finite magnetization at the sample edges because the magnetic dipole moment associated with spin angular moment is twice as large as that of the oam .",
    "finally , we find that there are interesting relations between the berry vector potential and the spin and oam hall conductivities .",
    "for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) confined in a semiconductor heterostructure , two major spin - orbit ( so ) interaction terms are usually present .",
    "one is the rashba term  @xcite , @xmath20 which stems from the structural inversion asymmetry . here ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the three pauli matrices .",
    "the other is the dresselhaus so coupling which results from the bulk inversion asymmetry , if the heterostructure is made of semiconductors without spatial inversion symmetry such as semiconductors in the zincblende structure  @xcite .",
    "the dresselhaus term is given by @xmath23 therefore , the full hamiltonian for the 2deg with rashba - dresselhaus so coupling can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the effective mass of the electrons in the 2deg .",
    "interestingly , though the dresselhaus coupling coefficient @xmath26 is fixed for a given structure , the rashba coupling strength @xmath27 can be tuned by a gate voltage by up to 50 %  @xcite , thereby providing an opportunity to study the interesting interplay between both types of the so coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian has been solved exactly by several authors .",
    "the eigenstates can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is band index and @xmath30 the corresponding eigenenergies is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it can be proved that the difference of two fermi momenta @xmath38 is given by ( @xmath39 . the band structure consists of two energy bands which are degenerate at the centre of the 2d momentum space @xmath40 , as schematically illustrated in the left panel of fig .",

    "@xmath47 after an external electric field @xmath48 ( indicated as the large horizontal ( red ) arrow ) is applied along the @xmath49 axis , the bands move in the -@xmath50 direction with the distance @xmath51 ( see subsec .",

    "we assume that the two bands are all occupied by the electrons and the fermi energy is larger than the so splitting .",

    "we find that @xmath85 is the conventional spin hall conductivity and @xmath86 is the conductivity due to the spin torque correction .",
    "therefore , the spin hall conductivity defined as the response of the conserved effective spin current is : @xmath87 which is independent on the carrier density .",
    "remarkably , with the spin torque correction term @xmath88 included , the sign of the effective spin hall conductivity is opposite to the conventional spin hall conductivity reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the usual oam current operator was introduced as @xmath89 where @xmath7 is the @xmath54 component of the oam operator . in the rashba hamiltonian and with this definition of the oam current ,",
    "the spin hall effect is always accompanied by the oam hall effect which was first noted by zhang and yang  @xcite . in a so system ,",
    "such a definition has the same problems as the conventional spin current operator because the oam current is not a conserved quantity .",
    "therefore , we derive the continuity equation for the effective oam current ( see appendix b ) .",

    "substituting @xmath99 into continuity equation of oam , we obtain @xmath100 as the effective oam current .",
    "the torque dipole density vanishes outside the bulk , and we can write @xmath101",

    "the final state ket must coincide with initial state vector , apart from a phase factor .",
    "berry  @xcite has shown that the state ket will acquire an additional phase factor as the system undergoes the adiabatic evolution .",

    "the connection between the dissipationless spin hall conductivity and berry curvature has been shown in  @xcite .",

    "the sign of the total angular momentum hall conductivity is always negative , and , as will be discussed shortly , this is because the hall conductivity is dominated by the negative oam hall conductivity .",
    "when the two so coupling strengths are comparable , the total angular momentum hall conductivity is very large , suggesting the interesting possibility of tuning the angular momentum hall effect by varying the rashba so coupling strength .",

    "the torque oam hall conductivity is twice as large as the conventional oam hall conductivity but has an opposite sign , resulting in that the effective oam hall conductivity has the same size but opposite sign to the conventional oam hall conductivity ( table i ) .",
    "the conventional oam hall conductivity has been reported in ref .  , and our result is consistent with this previous calculation .",

    ", we get an effective spin hall conductivity of @xmath224 , and an effective oam hall conductivity of @xmath225 .",
    "this implies that when the torque correction term is taken into account , the spin hall current is still exactly canceled by the accompanied oam hall current and there is no total angular momentum current in the pure rashba system .",
    "this interesting observation has been reported before in ref . in the context of the conventional definition of the spin and oam currents .",
    "this may be expected because @xmath226 = 0 $ ] and the conservation of the total angular momentum therefore must be obeyed no matter what definitions of the effective angular momentum currents one adopts .",
    "nonetheless , we want to point out here that the spin hall effect in the pure rashba hamiltonian can still manifest itself and be detected in several ways , even though the total angular momentum hall current is zero .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic dipole moment associated with the spin of an electron is @xmath227 and the one associated with the oam of an electron is @xmath228 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , although the total angular momentum ( @xmath229 ) current is zero , the total magnetization [ @xmath230 current would not be zero and will give rise to finite magnetization at the edge of the sample .",
    "therefore , the spin hall effect in the pure rashba hamiltonian can in principle be probed in at least two ways . as noted in ref .",

    "recently , it is suggested in ref .",
    "that spin current can be detected by measuring time dependent magnetization precession .      in the case of @xmath231 and @xmath232 ,",
    "the hamiltonian reduces to the pure dresselhaus hamiltonian . in this case , the total , torque correction and conventional spin and oam hall conductivities have the same signs ( table i ) .",
    "for example , the total spin hall conductivity is @xmath225 , being the same as the total oam hall conductivity , thereby giving rise to a total angular momentum hall conductivity of @xmath222 . in the dresselhaus hamiltonian ,",
    "the total angular momentum is not conserved , i.e. , @xmath233 = -2i\\beta(\\sigma_x p_y + \\sigma_y p_x ) \\neq 0 $ ] .",

    "therefore , the spin and oam hall conductivities would add up rather than cancel each other , in contrast to the rashba hamiltonian .",
    "we notice that the spin hall conductivity in the clean limit is constant in either pure rashba system , or pure dresselhaus system , or the mixture rashba - dresselhaus system @xmath236see table i(a)@xmath237 $ ] .",
    "interestingly , in refs .   and  , it is pointed that the constant spin hall conductivity in pure rashba system would result in an unphysically growth of the magnetization with time .",
    "this is due to the fact that the conventionally defined spin hall current in the pure rashba system turns out to be proportional to the time derivative of the magnetizaion of the system .",
    "this linear relation between the conventional spin hall current and the time derivative of the magnetization should also exist in the pure dresselhaus system because the two systems are related by the unitary transformation : @xmath238 and @xmath239 , as mentioned above in sec .",
    "indeed , we find that the conventional spin current in the pure dresselhaus system is @xmath240 , where the relation @xmath241 was used .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the spin precession and conventional spin current satisfy the relations : @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "therefore , the constant conventional spin current in the clean limit in the pure dresselhaus system would also lead to the unphysical consequence that both @xmath244 and @xmath245 depend linearly on time , resulting in an infinite growth of the magnetization .",
    "in contrast , because the conserved spin current satisfies the continuity equation @xmath236eq .",
    "( 1)@xmath237 $ ] , we find no such relation that the conserved spin current is proportional to the time derivative of the spin operator , thereby , free from the artifact discussed above , as also pointed out in ref .  .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the spin hall coductivity in the rashba - dresselhaus hamiltonian with the spin torque correction in the absence of disorder , and find it to have the same magnitude but an opposite sign to the result reported before  @xcite .",
    "the spin hall conductivity in the absence of disorder is still a constant in pure dresselhaus ( or rashba ) system even when the torque correction is considered .",
    "we also introduce the conserved effective oam current and find that in general , the oam hall effect does not cancel the spin hall effect in the 2deg with the rashba - dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the oam hall conductivity depends significantly on the strength ratio of the rashba to dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling , suggesting that one can manipulate the total hall current through tuning the rashba coupling by a gate voltage  @xcite .",
    "we argue that in a pure rashba system , though the spin hall conductivity is exactly cancelled by the oam hall conductivity due to the angular momentum conservation , the spin hall effect still manifest itself as nonzero magnetization hall current and finite magnetization at the sample edges because the magnetic dipole moment associated with the spin of an electron is twice as large as that of the oam .",

    "let us also introduce the operator @xmath365 where @xmath350 and @xmath366 is the vector potential . using the above gauge transformation  @xcite",

    "the vector potential @xmath373 in the eigenstates @xmath67 can be defined as @xmath374 which generally depends on band index @xmath1 .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the spin and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) hall effect in a high mobility two - dimensional electron system with rashba and dresselhuas spin - orbit coupling by introducing both the spin and oam torque corrections , respectively , to the spin and oam currents . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when both bands are occupied , the spin hall conductivity is still a constant ( i.e. , independent of the carrier density ) which , however , has an opposite sign to the previous value . the spin hall conductivity in general would not be cancelled by the oam hall conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the oam hall conductivity is also independent of the carrier density but depends on the strength ratio of the rashba to dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling , suggesting that one can manipulate the total hall current through tuning the rashba coupling by a gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in a pure rashba system , though the spin hall conductivity is exactly cancelled by the oam hall conductivity due to the angular momentum conservation , the spin hall effect could still manifest itself as nonzero magnetization hall current and finite magnetization at the sample edges because the magnetic dipole moment associated with the spin of an electron is twice as large as that of the oam . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the electric field - induced oam and discuss the origin of the oam hall current . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the spin and oam hall conductivities are closely related to the berry vector ( or gauge ) potential . </S>"
