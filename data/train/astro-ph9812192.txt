    "the thermal evolution of jupiter and saturn is a long - standing problem which couples the transport properties of the atmosphere and interior of jupiter / saturn , the thermodynamics and phase diagram of the deep interior , and the effect of solar heating of the atmosphere .",
    "new perspectives on this problem have been provided by recent experiments on the metallization of hydrogen at high pressures @xcite , new results for the composition of the jovian atmosphere from the galileo entry probe @xcite , and recent work by our research group on the evolution of extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the thermal evolution of a giant planet with an isentropic or near - isentropic interior temperature distribution is parametrized in terms of a surface which relates the three variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the effective temperature at which the planet radiates its internally - derived and converted solar energy into space , @xmath1 is the temperature at 10 bars pressure , which characterizes the isentrope in the outer layers of the planet ( note that if the atmosphere is radiative at 10 bars , @xmath1 represents the temperature on the deeper isentrope extrapolated to 10 bars ) , and @xmath2 is the surface gravity .",
    "the surface is shown in fig .",
    "1 .    figure 1 illustrates that the theory of the evolution of jupiter and saturn can be subsumed within a larger study of giant planets and brown dwarfs .",
    "the principal difference between jupiter and saturn and more massive bodies is that the evolution of the former involves a possible phase separation of helium within the metallic - hydrogen interior , as shown in fig",
    ". 2 @xcite .",
    "evolution models of jupiter and saturn ( saumon et  al . , 1992 ; guillot et  al . ,",
    "1995 ) have so far assumed the planet to remain homogeneous in the hydrogen - helium phase .",
    "this is questionable in the case of jupiter , and certainly wrong for saturn .    in fig .",
    "2 , the solid curves show present - day jupiter and saturn , while the dashed curves show evolving models at earlier epochs with homogeneous and solar h - he proportions . in a fully consistent treatment of helium separation ,",
    "the partitioning of helium in the metallic - hydrogen core would be calculated in accordance with a model free energy for a mixture of metallic hydrogen and helium .",
    "this paper does not carry out such a treatment .",
    "rather , we introduce two limiting versions of separation of helium from hydrogen , carried out in such a way that the essential conclusions can be applied to separation of any denser component ( e.g. , ice or rock ) from hydrogen .",
    "the helium distribution in a jupiter or saturn model is characterized by @xmath3 , the helium mass fraction of the hydrogen - helium mixture in a given layer .",
    "the hydrogen mass fraction is then @xmath4 .",
    "we characterize the value of @xmath3 in initial models with homogeneous hydrogen - helium composition by @xmath5 , which we take to be the initial protosolar value .    in the first version of the theory , discussed in section 2",
    ", unmixing is assumed to occur with a linear time dependence , with the denser component ( nominally he ) being depleted by a constant factor throughout the molecular envelope and enriched by a constant factor throughout the metallic - hydrogen interior . in the second version , discussed in section 3 , unmixing occurs only in the final stages of evolution of the planet , occurring between the last dashed - curve model and the solid - curve model of fig .",
    "2 . in the second version",
    ", the denser component is removed uniformly from all hydrogen - rich layers and added to a dense core at the center of the planet .",
    "we will argue in the conclusion that the two versions of chemical evolution set limits on the possible unmixing in the two planets , and hence , on the maximum helium depletion to be expected in the atmosphere .",
    "we present an estimation of the delay in the cooling of the planets introduced by helium ( or any other element ) differentiation using a simple analytical model .",
    "the following assumptions are used : ( i ) the planet is fully isentropic , has no core , and is solely made of hydrogen and helium .",
    "( ii ) it is initially homogeneous , but a phase separation ( or phase transition ) occurs at a fractional mass @xmath6 ( note that @xmath7 ranges from @xmath8 at the center to @xmath9 at the surface ) , which leads to the creation of an upper helium poor region ( labelled i ) , and a deeper helium - rich region ( labelled ii ) .",
    "the compositional difference between the two regions is defined by the difference in their hydrogen mass fraction @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath11 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath12 and that @xmath13 .",
    "( iii ) the transition region between i and ii is infinitely small , and any change in composition due either to the variations of @xmath14 or of @xmath15 with time is instantaneously redistributed by convection , so that regions i and ii remain homogeneous and adiabatic .",
    "( iv ) finally , we assume that the energy released by the falling helium droplets all goes into intrinsic planetary luminosity .",
    "in fact , a small fraction ( about 10% perhaps ) is retained in the form of a higher internal temperature @xcite .",
    "following hubbard s ( 1977 ) procedure , we derive the evolution time scale from the energy conservation equation , but splitting the time derivative of the specific entropy @xmath16 in two parts : a homogeneous , and an inhomogeneous part : @xmath17 dm .",
    "\\label{eq : energy}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the mass fraction variable , normalized to unity at the planet s surface .",
    "we assume that the total specific entropy depends linearly on the mass mixing ratios of hydrogen and helium , respectively ( thereby neglecting the small contribution due to the mixing entropy ) .",
    "this yields @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the specific entropies of pure hydrogen and pure helium , respectively .",
    "furthermore , using mass conservation in the planet between instants @xmath12 and @xmath21 yields : @xmath22 in this case , we assumed @xmath6 to be a decreasing function of time ( such as the plasma phase transition , which moves with time towards the center of the planet ) .",
    "this has no consequence on the final result however .",
    "the derivative @xmath23 is infinite between @xmath6 and @xmath24 , but its integral over this mass interval is finite : @xmath25    putting eqs .",
    "[ eq : ds ] , [ eq : dxdt ] and [ eq : intdx ] into eq.[eq : energy ] yields : the first term on the right hand side of the equation corresponds to homogeneous contraction and cooling of the planet .",
    "the second one , proportional to @xmath26 , is due to helium sedimentation . in our case",
    ", @xmath15 is monotonically increasing with time .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( except in very particular cases which are of little importance here ) , so that this second term is positive .",
    "helium sedimentation thus provides an additional energy source .",
    "finally , the third term , proportional to @xmath29 , is caused by the displacement of the phase separation level with time .",
    "its sign is unknown : if the transition between regions i and ii follows the plasma phase transition @xcite , then @xmath14 should decrease with time .",
    "on the other hand , a more general phase diagram could lead to either positive or negative @xmath29 .",
    "finally the bracketed term is generally negative , but only if @xmath14 is not too close to the center of the planet ( more than @xmath30 ) .",
    "if this is verified , the whole third term is positive ( i.e. provides energy ) if the transition moves towards the planetary center , and negative if @xmath14 gets closer to the surface .",
    "we estimate quantitatively the significance of the different terms constituting eq .",
    "[ eq : evol ] using today s models of jupiter and saturn",
    ". a more satisfactory approach would be the direct derivation of the equation and the calculation of an evolution consistently taking into account non - homogeneous effects .",
    "however , our simple approach is justified , in view of the uncertainties that remain on the hydrogen - helium phase diagram [ @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion ] or on the presence of a first order molecular / metallic hydrogen phase transition .",
    "we assume that the phase separation level is closely associated to the molecular / metallic hydrogen transition and accordingly use the derivation by @xcite to predict the value of @xmath14 and its evolution with time .",
    "its present value is @xmath31 in jupiter and @xmath32 in saturn .",
    "this number can change depending on the model , especially in the case of saturn .",
    "thus , we find : @xmath33 furthermore , using homogeneous evolution calculations , we derive an upper limit to the displacement of the transition with time : @xmath34 this relation being valid for jupiter and saturn",
    ". we can derive only an upper limit because any helium differentiation tends to slow the cooling and contraction of the planet .",
    "these numerical estimations can be put into eq .",
    "[ eq : evol ] and compared to the intrinsic luminosity per unit mass of jupiter and saturn , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "static interior models in agreement with the measured gravitational moments predict that @xmath37 in jupiter and that @xmath38 in saturn .",
    "the contribution due to the displacement of the transition level is of the order of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in jupiter and saturn , respectively .",
    "it will therefore be neglected in this section .",
    "the following section presents an approximate treatment based on the phase diagram of @xcite . in general",
    ", this effect may contribute as much as @xmath41% change to the calculated ages .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath29 being thus ignored in eq .",
    "[ eq : evol ] , we derive the time delay due to a linear increase of the mass fraction discontinuity @xmath15 over the time @xmath42 , by assuming that today s luminosity is entirely due to the differentiation : @xmath43 using model ages from homogeneous evolution calculations , and reasonable uncertainties due to both the model atmospheres and to the approximations inherent in our semi - analytical model , we can hence constrain @xmath15 .    for jupiter , calculations based on homogeneous evolution ( see below ) give model ages between 3.6 and 5.1gyr , the lower limit being derived from models with a radiative zone and an interpolated equation of state , and the upper limit from fully adiabatic models with a ppt eos . with a @xmath44gyr uncertainty ,",
    "we derive that , for jupiter , @xmath45 .",
    "this global constraint is not very useful and has in fact to be linked to the various static models to predict values of @xmath15 . in the case of saturn ,",
    "homogeneous evolution models predict ages between 2 and 3gyr .",
    "it therefore appears that a more useful constraint can be derived for this planet : @xmath46 .",
    "in this section we present an alternative approach in which we estimate the heat evolved during a single time step @xmath47 in which a dense component settles out from a hydrogen - helium mixture into the core .",
    "the dense component is taken to be helium , but similar considerations apply to any constituent whose specific entropy is much smaller than hydrogen s ( as is true in general ) .",
    "thus we write a variant of eq .",
    "[ eq : energy ] in the following form :    @xmath48/(l / m ) , \\label{eq : wbh1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 with @xmath50 the radius of the planet s photosphere and @xmath51 the effective radiating temperature that the photosphere would have if it were radiating only thermalized sunlight . for homogeneous evolution , @xmath0 and specific entropy @xmath16 ( as parametrized by @xmath1 ) are uniquely related at each point in the evolution , via the surface presented in fig .",
    "1 . we treat inhomogeneous evolution by starting with an optimized model of present jupiter or saturn with specified helium mass fraction ( relative to the total hydrogen - helium mass ) @xmath3 in the entire hydrogen - rich portion of the planet .",
    "the remaining helium or other dense component is assumed to be incorporated in a central core . in some sense",
    ", this model represents an upper limit on the heat release ( and concomitant prolongation of cooling ) caused by a given amount of helium separation , since the mass of low - specific - entropy material displaced to the center of the planet is maximized .",
    "we now consider evolution backward in time to a previous model in which the helium incorporated in the core is restored to the hydrogen - rich envelope , which then has a helium mass fraction equal to @xmath52 .",
    "the time step involved in this process is evaluated using eq .",
    "( 10 ) . at prior times",
    "the evolution is homogeneous .    in the sample calculations presented here ,",
    "we assume , for jupiter , that the planet evolves from a uniform @xmath53 to a separated model at present with @xmath54 in the entire h part of the planet and pure he ( corresponding to the depleted amount of he ) in a core at the center . for saturn",
    ", we assume the same scenario except that the present model has @xmath55 in the entire h part of the planet .    for both planets ,",
    "the following effects occur between the present - day model ( shown with solid line in fig .",
    "2 ) and the previous undifferentiated model . first",
    ", the central temperature is _ larger _ in the present - day model because of greater differentiation .",
    "this corresponds to the energy retained in the form of a higher internal temperature mentioned previously .",
    "second , a mass element which is depleted in the denser component ( going forward in time ) goes to a higher specific entropy , because it is richer in h , while mass elements near the center of the planet go to a lower specific entropy . because the latter are at a higher temperature than the former , there is a net heat release going forward in time .",
    "the heat which is released to space during this single time step , i.e. total heat release less heat stored via heating of the interior due to core formation , is @xmath56 for jupiter , and @xmath57 for saturn .",
    "similar values are found from eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , when assuming @xmath58 and @xmath59 for jupiter and @xmath60 for saturn ( where in this case @xmath14 denotes the mass fraction of the pure helium core ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of jupiter and saturn for three assumptions about solar heating .",
    "the crosses show the evolution of isolated objects with @xmath61 .",
    "the open circles show evolution with @xmath51 held constant at its present value for each planet , while the dots show evolution with a variable @xmath51 computed on the assumption that the solar luminosity has increased roughly linearly with time from an initial value of about 72% of the present luminosity .",
    "this calculation assumes than jupiter s bond albedo has remained constant in time at its present value ( 0.343 ) .",
    "however it is likely that during the time water clouds first condensed in the planet s atmosphere ( near @xmath62 k ) , the bond albedo was substantially higher for a time until the clouds moved lower in the atmosphere with decreasing @xmath0 . at earlier times",
    "still the planet would be free of clouds of abundant species , yet the bond albedo would be similar to the current time .",
    "@xcite discuss bond albedos for jupiter - like models with and without clouds .",
    "figure 4 shows an expanded view of the final stages of evolution of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the vertical error bars show the present values for the two planets .",
    "the heavy horizontal error bar shows the prolongation of ages for the @xmath63 assumed in this section .",
    "however , it assumes the linear differentiation with time of the previous section , and that the helium separates into the metallic hydrogen region but not the very center of the planet .",
    "our conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(a ) the atmospheric boundary conditions are reasonably well understood ( see fig . 1 ) and are no longer a source of major uncertainty in the cooling theory for jupiter and saturn . with these boundary conditions and the assumption of homogeneous evolution",
    ", jupiter cools to its present @xmath0 in 3.6 to 5.2 gyr , while saturn cools to its present @xmath0 in approximately 2 to 3 gyr .",
    "therefore differentiation is needed to account for saturn s present luminosity , but not necessarily for jupiter s .",
    "\\(b ) solar heating prolongs the cooling time of jupiter by about 1 gyr and the cooling time of saturn by about 0.5 gyr . allowance for lower solar heating in the past reduces the effect by @xmath64 gyr for both planets , a very minor effect . likewise variation in the planetary bond albedo with time",
    "will have comparably small effects on the evolution .",
    "\\(c ) we have considered two limiting models for he differentiation in jupiter . the model presented in section 3 shows that a pure helium core can not have formed in jupiter and result in the presently observed atmospheric @xmath3 . such a recent differentiation in jupiter , corresponding to a reduction of the atmospheric @xmath3 by about 0.03 ( the voyager result ) would indeed prolong the evolution by about another 2 gyr .",
    "in contrast , the model presented in section 2 predicts that the difference between the primordial helium mass fraction @xmath65 and the present atmospheric @xmath3 should lie in the range @xmath66 . note that a value of zero for @xmath63 corresponds to no differentiation , whereas a negative value indicates an unlikely upward transport of any element other than hydrogen .",
    "however models for which @xmath67 can not reproduce the planet s gravitational field @xcite . thus @xmath68 .",
    "this is higher than the voyager value @xmath69 @xcite but it includes the new galileo value @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "\\(d ) we have considered two limiting models for he differentiation in saturn . the model presented in section 3 shows that recent differentiation of helium in saturn , corresponding to a reduction of the atmospheric @xmath3 by about 0.07 would prolong the evolution by about another 2 gyr , bringing agreement between the observed age and @xmath0 .",
    "the model presented in section 2 predicts that @xmath71 , and hence @xmath72 .",
    "neither limiting model includes the voyager value @xmath73 . the case for a higher atmospheric @xmath3 in saturn",
    "is further strengthened by static models , the enrichment in heavy elements required to fit the planetary gravitational field being incompatible with the observed methane abundance for @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "\\(e ) the models presented must both be corrected for the fact that the energy that results from differentiation is not added entirely at the end of the evolution .",
    "should helium differentiation occur very early in the evolution ( a very unlikely assumption ) , the subsequent time delay would be negligible compared to the present calculations . in most likely cases , we estimate that it yields time delays overestimated by @xmath41% for jupiter , and by @xmath75% for saturn .",
    "\\(f ) the most precise determination of the jovian helium abundance in the outer atmosphere is that of the galileo helium abundance detector , and our results are in excellent agreement with that measurement .",
    "the voyager - determined jovian helium abundance lies below both , and indeed for saturn we also predict a helium abundance larger than that determined by voyager .",
    "both the very precise galileo had determination and that of the galileo mass spectrometer @xcite , which is fully consistent with but less precise than the had value , give us confidence in our model results .",
    "in fact , we suggest that a reexamination of the voyager helium determinations for both planets may be order , specifically with the aim of assessing whether the initial analyses has errors that systematically lowered the helium abundances .",
    "this exercise is not an academic one , because the cassini mission enroute to saturn will not be capable of providing in situ measurements of the helium abundance .",
    "the galileo jupiter results combined with ours raise a potential concern that the cassini remote sensing measurements to determine helium in saturn , using cirs and radio occultations , might be subject to similar systematic errors .",
    "it must be stressed that these are still preliminary models .",
    "a more detailed study interfaced to a complete physical picture of the h - he phase diagram is in preparation .",
    "we should also note that in either limiting model , the extra heat which is liberated could come from the differentiation of some other dense component beside helium .",
    "thus an observational result indicating a primordial solar value for the atmospheric helium abundance would not necessarily preclude extension of the cooling time via differentiation of another abundant component .",
