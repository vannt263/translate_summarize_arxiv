    "we get the conventional amplified factors represented by dashed lines in terms of the relation @xmath103 .",
    "it is shown that the amplified factor has no upper bound when the @xmath35 approaches to @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , both for two preselected states @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the behavior of the amplified factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 shown as the solid lines is similar to that of amplified shifts . in each panel , the modified theory is compared with the conventional theory , and once again , the difference between conventional and modified values would be significant if the preselected angle @xmath35 is small .",
    "the deviation of the amplified factors between the two theories is also determined by incident angle , especially for @xmath7 .",
    "the experimental results agree well with the modified values .",
    "there exists a peak value with an optimal postselected angle , and the amplification effect disappears when the preselected and postselected states are completely orthogonal .",
    "that is to say , by adjusting the postselected angle @xmath35 , one can obtain the maximum amplified factor and improve the precision for measuring the photonic she  @xcite .",
    "note that the signal amplification from weak measurements has been extensively studied recently , such as optimal probe wavefunction of weak - value amplification  @xcite , technical advantages for weak - value amplification  @xcite , and maximizing the output by weak values and weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "note that there are still some open questions about whether the weak value ampliation can suppress technical noise  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the connection between the condition of weak - interaction and the output intensity of the light in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . here",
    ", we analyze the distortion associated with the postselected angle . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig5](f ) , we measured its intensity with a decreasing angle @xmath35 , and found that the intensity changes gradually from a single gaussian into asymmetrical double - peak intensity .",
    "then the double - peak intensity becomes symmetric when postselected angle is equal to @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we present the intensity with two postselected angles which are labeled by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig5](f ) . both for the predicted and measured intensity",
    ", they remain the gaussian form with the @xmath85 , but distort with the @xmath104 .",
    "we draw a conclusion that with different postselected angles , the experimental data do not fit to the conventional theory when the profile of wavefunction distorts . therefore , one may judge weather the modified theory is equivalent to the conventional one by observing the output intensity of the light .    the tiny original shifts of the component of @xmath9 obtained by the modified theory for preselected states @xmath7 and @xmath8 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . for each preselected states",
    ", we detect it with two different postselected angles .",
    "we find that the original shift of @xmath7 is indeed very large near the brewster angle : nearly the same scale as the width of probe state @xmath105 , as the result , the profile is strongly distorted and the weak measurements approximations fail . for the preselected state @xmath8 , the original shifts for various incident angles are always much less than the width of pointer state @xmath106 .",
    "both experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions .",
    "it should be noted in the strong - coupling case the spin - dependent splitting is very sensitive to the variation of physical parameters and therefore has important applications in precision metrology , such as measuring thickness of metal film  @xcite , identifying graphene layers  @xcite , determining the strength of axion coupling in topological insulators  @xcite , and detecting of magneto - optical constant of magneto - optical media  @xcite .",
    "however , in this regime both conventional weak measurements theory and its second - order corrections can not obtain the exact meter shifts as the analysis above .",
    "hence the modified weak measurement is important in precision metrology .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that photonic she manifests as spin - dependent splitting of light , which corresponds to two types of geometric phases : the rytov - vladimirskii - berry phase associated with the evolution of the propagation direction of light and the pancharatnam - berry phase related to the manipulation with the polarization state of light  @xcite . in general , the spin - dependent splitting due to the rytov - vladimirskii - berry phase is limited by a fraction of the wavelength , and can only be detected by weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , the spin - dependent splitting due to the pancharatnam - berry phase can be large enough for direct detection ( strong measurements ) without using the weak measurement technology  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rapidly varying phase discontinuities along a metasurface , breaking the axial symmetry of the system , enable the direct observation of the spin - dependent splitting  @xcite . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the modified theory is important where neither weak nor strong measurements can detect the spin - dependent splitting .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a modified weak measurements for the detection of the photonic she . compared with the conventional weak measurements , the amplified shift , amplified factor , and original displacement for different preselected and postselected states",
    "have been examined .",
    "the conventional theory for preselected state @xmath7 is invalid in the strong - coupling regime or when the preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal .",
    "but for preselected state @xmath8 it is only limited by the latter since the condition of weak coupling is always satisfied .",
    "we have shown that the weak measurements for detecting photonic she need to be modified when one of the condition is violated .",
    "this is due to the fact that probe wavefunction is distorted in the case of strong coupling or preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal .",
    "otherwise , the modified theory can reduce to the conventional one beyond the two restrictions .",
    "we have found that the measuring procedure with preselected and postselected ensembles is still effective .",
    "this scheme is important for us to detect the photonic she in the case where neither weak nor strong measurements can detect the spin - dependent splitting .",
    "our modified theory is valid not only in weak - coupling regime but also in the strong - coupling regime , and especially in the intermediate regime .",
    "we believe that such problem may also exist in the weak measurements of other quantum systems and would have possible applications in precision measurements ."
