    "in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) of high energy physics there are many unclear issues that require extensions of the theory in the local symmetry and in the particle spectrum .",
    "one of these issues is the flavor puzzle : why there are three families of fermions and why they have their peculiar structure of masses and mixings .",
    "there are many studies of these problems in the quark sector where are different observables in the up and down sector .",
    "usually , the mixing and masses pattern are studied through the flavor changing neutral current processes ( fcnc ) and constraints on flavor symmetries are obtained @xcite . in the leptonic sector many analysis have been done in the neutrino sector using specially the available data coming from different neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "an important sector of phenomenology is concern to charged lepton flavor violating processes ( lfv ) because they provide direct information about the flavor structure of the lepton sector .",
    "phenomenologically , there are different models and extensions of the sm that explain lfv .",
    "one common approach is to include non - renormalizable effective operators of dimension five and six in order to have a source of lfv processes @xcite .",
    "the effective operators approach is quite general to look for the new physics effects at low energies but the limits obtained on the lfv couplings are not translate easily to specific models @xcite .",
    "experimentallly , there are searches of charged lfv processes using channels like @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and conversion @xmath9 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the experiment meg , psi ( switzerland ) gives the best limits on @xmath10 , reporting @xmath11 and they expect to reach a sensibility @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , for the process @xmath13 is reported by sindrum i to be in the range of @xmath14 and the next collaborations music and @xmath15 expect to reach up to @xmath16 . and",
    "for the processes @xmath17 nuclei conversion , the rate reported by sindrum ii is @xmath18 and the future experiments mu2e ( fnla ) and comet ( j - parc ) expecto to reach @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "lfv processes have been also searched in the tau lepton sector and around 48 decay channels have been studied by babar and belle @xcite .",
    "the best results obtained at @xmath20 c.l .",
    "are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and three body decays @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "future experiments like superb or belle ii could get sensibilities of the order of @xmath25 . and finally , one new player in the experimental enviroment is arriving and it is lhcb , they have reported an upper bound on @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of physics beyond the sm is to solve the flavor problem and explain the patterns and mixings in the fermion phenomenology . in grand",
    "unified theories , different representations are assigned to the fermions and therefore different patterns can emerge in the quark sector as well as the lepton sector .",
    "lfv processes in the framework of the extended gauge theories is one option to test these models .",
    "one possible alternative is based on the gauge symmetry @xmath27 , known as 331 models@xcite .",
    "these models can explain why there are three fermionic families through the chiral anomaly cancellation condition and the number of colors in qcd .",
    "on the other hand , the models based on the 331 symmetry are built in such a way that the couplings of the quarks with the new neutral @xmath5 boson are not universal in the interaction basis , making them not diagonal in the mass eigenstates basis and yielding to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree level @xcite .",
    "this is a special feature of the 331 models , due to one quark family being in a different representation of the gauge group to the other two families , in order to satisfy the chiral anomaly cancellation condition .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in some 331 models there are not only contributions from the left handed neutral current but also from the right handed neutral currents .",
    "there are many studies of these new fcnc in the quark sector where are different observables in the up and down sectors that constrain such kind of processes@xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are not so many analysis in the leptonic sector , where leptonic flavor violation ( lfv ) processes at tree level are present .",
    "in particular , lfv processes such as @xmath28 with @xmath29 , have been discussed in the framework of the minimal supersimmetric standard model , little higgs models , left - right symmetry models and many other extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "some of these models predict branching fractions for @xmath28 of the order of @xmath30 which could be detected in future experiments .",
    "different 331 models can be built @xcite , they can be distinguished using the electric charge of the new particles introduced in the spectrum and the structure of the scalar sector , where models without exotic charges will be considered . in general , the 331 models",
    "are classified depending on how they cancel the chiral anomalies : there are two models that cancel out the anomalies requiring just one family and eight models where the three families are required . in the three family models ,",
    "there are four models where the leptons are treated identically , two of them treat two quark generations identically and finally , there are two models where all the lepton generations are treated differently @xcite .",
    "there is one of these 331 models where the leptonic sector is described by five left handed leptonic triplets in different representations of the @xmath31 gauge group . using these five leptonic representations it is possible to obtain models where the three known leptons coupled to the @xmath5 boson are very different with respect to the new ones .",
    "we concentrate on these models in this work , studying the lfv processes and obtain constraints on the leptonic mixing matrix . in the next section",
    "we are going to present the main features of the model under consideration and then we focus on the lfv processes , namely @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and @xmath32 , @xmath6 and @xmath33 .",
    "the model considered is based on the local gauge symmetry @xmath34 ( 331 ) , where it is common to write the electric charge generator as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group : @xmath35 where the parameter @xmath36 is used to label the particular type of 331 model considered .",
    "for constructing the model we choose @xmath37 , which corresponds to models where the new fields in the spectra do not have exotic electric charges .",
    "+ the quark content of this model is described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and their assigned quantum numbers of @xmath34 are shown in the parenthesis .    for the leptonic spectrum we use @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the five leptonic triplets together with the quark content insures cancellation of chiral anomalies@xcite .",
    "furthermore , notice that with this proposed assemble for the leptonic sector , there is only one of the triplets that is not written in the adjoint representation of @xmath31 and it contains one of the standard lepton families of the sm .",
    "on the other hand , in 331 models without exotic charges , the gauge bosons of the @xmath31 which transform according to the adjoint representation , are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the gell - mann matrices for the considered group .",
    "the gauge boson field @xmath44 is associated with the @xmath45 group which is a singlet under @xmath31 and it does not have electric charge .",
    "once the gauge boson sector is identified then the bosons of the neutral sector @xmath46 are rotated to get the new neutral gauge bosons @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath5 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the weinberg s angle defined by @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 the coupling constants of the @xmath31 and @xmath45 groups respectively ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) . in this new basis , the photon @xmath56 is the gauge boson associated to the charge generator @xmath57 while the @xmath58 boson can be identified as the usual @xmath48 gauge boson of the sm .",
    "scalar states in these models in general can be considered as real fields , therefore the neutral heavy state @xmath59im@xmath60 decouples from the other neutral bosons , becoming an exact mass eigenstate . however , the vector bosons @xmath48 , @xmath5 and @xmath59re@xmath60 in general mix @xcite .",
    "then , one can rotate to the mass eigenstate basis , say @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( where @xmath61 is the ordinary gauge boson seen in high energy experiments ) through an orthogonal mixing matrix @xmath64 : @xmath65 for the purpose of this work we will assume that @xmath66 does not mix with the @xmath48 and @xmath5 bosons . + about the scalar sector , we are going to break the symmetry in such a way that @xmath67 and we use the following three scalars @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "our main aim concerns the leptonic phenomenology and therefore only the leptonic sector will be addressed .",
    "the lagrangian for the neutral currents in this sector is @xmath75 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 in this notation stands for the charged leptons vector @xmath77 .",
    "the zero superscript denotes that the fields are in the interaction basis , and the couplings to the neutral bosons are @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "notice that the couplings of the standard charged leptons to the photon @xmath56 are universal as well as the couplings to the @xmath48 boson .",
    "a feature of this model is that the couplings of the standard left handed leptons as well as the right handed leptons to the @xmath5 boson are not universal , due to the fact that one of the lepton triplets is in a different representation to the other two . since these couplings to the @xmath5 boson are not universal , at least for the standard leptons , when they are rotated to mass eigenstates the obtained mixing matrix will allow lfv at tree level",
    ".    a similar procedure in the neutral leptonic sector can be done , @xmath80 generating the couplings @xmath81 here the couplings of the standard neutrinos to the photon @xmath47 and @xmath48 boson are universal but the couplings of the corresponding leptons to the @xmath5 are not . + it is possible to re - write the neutral current lagrangian in order to use the formalism presented in reference @xcite and generate an effective lagrangian like @xmath82 where the currents associated to the gauge @xmath48 and @xmath5 bosons are @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 leptons and the gauge bosons @xmath61 and @xmath62 are interaction eigenstates and the matrices @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the charged sector were defined in equation  . when the fields of the theory are rotated to mass or physical eigenstates the effective lagrangian for the charged leptons",
    "can be finally written as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 run over the chiralities @xmath91 and indices @xmath92 over the leptonic families .",
    "the coefficients @xmath93 for the standard leptons , assuming a mixing angle @xmath94 between @xmath48 and @xmath5 bosons , are given by @xcite , @xmath95 where @xmath96 the @xmath97 corresponds to the matrices obtained when the unitary matrices @xmath98 are introduced to obtain the mass eigenstates and to diagonalize the yukawa coupling matrices : @xmath99    for the matrix @xmath100 we will use a well accepted anstz @xcite where @xmath101 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and the unitary matrix @xmath104 can be parameterized using three standard mixing angles @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 and a phase @xmath108 , @xmath109 notice that if we are considering only the standard charged leptons , the coupling matrices in ec.[acople ] can be written as @xmath110 the terms which are proportional to the identity are not contributing to the lfv processes at tree level , while the second term in the above equations does . these equations ( [ eps2 ] )",
    "correspond to the case where the first family is in the adjoint representation .",
    "however , if the second family was the chosen one to be in a different representation then the only change is in the second term which is proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "finally , if instead of that the third family was chosen , then again the only change is the position of the entry different from zero in the second term .",
    "we should emphasize that the source of lfv in neutral currents mediated by the @xmath5 boson , comes from the non - diagonal elements in the @xmath112 matrices @xmath113 .",
    "our next task is to get bounds on the parameters involved in the lfv couplings and it is done considering different lfv processes .",
    "recently , the belle @xcite and babar@xcite collaborations have reported measurements of various lfv channels and they have put new bounds on these branching fractions , see table [ tab1 ] .",

    "we have noticed that taking @xmath146 and @xmath141 then there is not any improved bounds on the parameters and for the case @xmath143 then the mixing angles @xmath105 and @xmath106 are in the same order of magnitude .",
    "we should mention that using the process @xmath154 there is not obtained any bound on the mixing angles lower than the obtained previously , so it is less restrictive than the other processes considered here .",
    "the whole set of bounds obtained in the figures 2 - 5 help to obtain the order of magnitude of the mixing angles involved in order to satisfy the experimental bounds on the lfv processes considered in this work .",
    "there is one order of magnitude of difference between them and the hierarchy @xmath155 .",
    "now we can use the information obtained about the mixing angles and see what is happening in the neutrino sector of the model .",
    "first of all , we write down the charged current lagrangian as : @xmath156 where quantum fields are in the weak interaction basis . in order to go to the mass eigenstates ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce the rotation matrices @xmath157 and @xmath158 which are also diagonalizing the yukawa matrices .",
    "these matrices are defining the mixing matrix in the leptonic sector known as pmns matrix and it is @xmath159 .",
    "the matrices @xmath157 and @xmath158 are parameterized as in equation ( 19 ) . now taking into account that @xmath155 , it is possible to obtain the following limits on the mixing leptonic matrix @xmath160 on the other hand , considering massive neutrinos and the oscillation data , the mixing angles in the neutrino sector are around @xmath161 y @xmath162 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite where the final mixing matrix is ( at @xmath163 c.l . )",
    "@xmath164 finally , we can combine the matrices to obtain the pmns matrix and it is @xmath165 which is in agreement with the accepted values for this matrix in the literature @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in this work , we have addressed the lfv processes in a model based on the 331 symmetry where the leptonic sector is described by five left handed leptonic triplets in different representations of the @xmath31 gauge group . here , the couplings of the new neutral @xmath5 boson with the usual leptons are not universal .",
    "this feature is due to one of the lepton triplets being in a different representation than the other two , which leads to lfv at tree level once they are rotated to mass eigenstates .",
    "we have considered some lfv processes which have been measured by the belle and the babar collaborations : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath6 and @xmath32 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "tha analysis was done considering two cases depending on which leptonic family is in the different representation of @xmath31 in the 331 model described in section 2 . for the first case ( where the first leptonic family is in the different representation ) , we obtained allowed regions on the @xmath144 plane of the order of @xmath151 .",
    "for the second case ( the third leptonic family in a different representation ) , the bound on the process @xmath6 constrain the space of parameters to regions around @xmath168 , @xmath149 and @xmath169 .",
    "we also explored the bounds coming from other lfv processes , which are consistent with these regions and the results are shown in figures 2 - 5 .",
    "it is worth to point out that the mixing angles obtained for the leptons in the framework of the 331 model considered here is generating a matrix which is almost an identity matrix which is according with the no experimental evidence of the fcnc at low energies .",
    "therefore , even considering the mixing in the neutrino sector the results are in agreement with the experimental values reported for the pmns matrix .",
