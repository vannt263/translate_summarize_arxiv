    "we propose a unified structural description covering the whole temperature regime , from the high temperature microscopic dynamics described by collisional physics to the low temperature collective many particle activated dynamics .",
    "the mode coupling theory analyzes liquid state dynamics by starting from a gas - like mode of transport but including correlated collisions and back flow .",
    "mct does a good job describing structural correlations observed by neutron scattering in the normal liquid regime .",
    "mct can also describe the dynamics approaching the supercooled regime but fails below @xmath21 , where activated processes also contribute substantially .",
    "a deeply supercooled liquid explores a very rugged underlying free energy surface .",
    "the dynamics within each well may still be described by the idealized mct which does not take into account the possibility of hopping between wells .",
    "activated events represent essential singularities in the noise strength and thus are not contained in the perturbative mct . to include the effect of activated events on dynamical structure factor",
    ", we need to calculate two different quantities .",
    "first , we need to calculate the effect such an event ( which we call `` popping up of an instanton '' ) would have on the dynamic structure factor .",
    "the impact of such an instanton depends both on its size , that is , how many molecules are involved in the activated event and on how far particles are displaced by an activated transition . in rfot theory , these quantities are the dynamical correlation length @xmath22 and the lindemann length @xmath23 .",
    "second , we also need to know the probability of such an activated event occurring .",
    "we can estimate both this probability and the other quantities from the random first order transition theory using thermodynamic and structural information alone .    a similar underlying physical picture to that presented here has been put forward by fuchizaki and kawasaki @xcite using what they called dynamic density functional theory ( ddft ) to go beyond the mct . in this coarse - grained description",
    "one considers the time evolution of the density field on a lattice .",
    "the dynamics is supposed to be given by a master equation and the free energy functional is taken from ramakrishna - yussouff ( ry ) theory @xcite . as shown by singh , stoessel and wolynes @xcite , ry theory can produce multiple minima .",
    "fuchizaki and kawasaki have shown that transitions between such minima allow the structural relaxation of the coarse grained density field .",
    "they show these transitions give rise to a stretched exponential relaxation . in their calculation",
    ", the overlap between the time dependent density field and the reference one of the same lattice site , takes a constant value , close to unity , in the liquid but in the supercooled state , the overlap is less than one and decreases via discrete jumps which they have connected to activated hopping transition over free - energy barriers .",
    "they have further defined an order parameter which is the overlap of the density fields at different lattice sites .",
    "the distribution of the order parameter , in the normal liquid regime is sharply peaked around unity but at higher density the distribution is broad and peaked around a value less than unity .",
    "the broad distribution reflects the multi - minima aspects of the free - energy landscape .",
    "the scheme presented by fk was implemented numerically and does not give as explicit picture of the microscopic mechanism of hopping as the current treatment does . moreover , due to the temporal coarse graining the initial decay of the dynamic structure factor , @xmath24 and the subsequent plateau are missed in their analysis .",
    "in addition , their analysis did not highlight the connection with the configurational entropy of the system .",
    "in contrast the present unified theoretical treatment provides a @xmath24 which produces a correct behavior over the full time and temperature plane , and also provides an analytical expression of the dynamic structure factor where the hopping alone is considered from a microscopic point of view . in the following section",
    ", we find @xmath25 or the effect of hopping on the density relaxation .",
    "subsequently we incorporate @xmath26 in the total @xmath24 in a self - consistent way .",
    "here we describe the hopping in terms of the popping up of a single instanton which is an activated event whose probability is obtained from the random first order transition theory .",
    "let us say that an instanton pops up at a position @xmath27 .",
    "we will take this region of influence to be spherical on the average .",
    "near @xmath28 , good arguments suggest the region actually is fractal or string - like @xcite . but",
    "the effect will ultimately be spherically averaged anyway as we shall see below .",
    "the particles within the sphere of radius @xmath22 around the position @xmath27 will be displaced by a lindemann length , @xmath29 .",
    "now the change in density @xmath30 due to a single instanton popping up can be written as , @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 provides the effect of the instanton felt at the position @xmath33 , provided it is within the radius @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath34 is the greens function which determines the effect of instanton in moving particles from position @xmath33 to a new one @xmath35 , typically lindemann length away during time @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 determines the region where the effect of the instanton is felt .",
    "since a given instanton pops up at a specific location the transformation is not translationally invariant , but when averaged over the droplet location and orientation we restore translational and rotational invariance ,      where , @xmath40 is the overlap volume of two spheres of radius @xmath22 centered at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , and @xmath43 is the volume of the region participating in hopping .",
    "@xmath22 defines the region of hopping which is calculated from rfot theory @xcite .",
    "the rfot @xmath22 is of the order of a molecular length,a at @xmath13 but diverges as @xmath44 as the kauzmann temperature is approached . near @xmath2 ( where the timescale is of the order of 1 hour )",

    "now lets say that the rate of a particle hopping is given by @xmath48 .",
    "thus the probability of any particle hopping in the region of volume @xmath49 during the time interval @xmath50 is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the volume of a particle ( a particle will be a bead according to rfot theory ) .",
    "if we include this information in the above equation and take a laplace transform we get ,    @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus we obtain , @xmath54 in calculation of the hopping rate we have considered that hopping is instantaneous . but simulations have shown @xcite that once it occurs , hopping happens over a period of time .",
    "this would give a further frequency dependence to @xmath55 .",
    "the fluctuations of entropic driving force leads to a distribution of hopping rates @xmath48 @xcite . to account for this",
    "we can consider that there are n - type of instanton with lifetimes ( @xmath56 ) and with occurrence probability @xmath57 . in this case equation [ phihop8",
    "] can be averaged over different instanton lifetimes and rates . here , for simplification we replace @xmath48 by the average hopping rate @xmath58 which is given by @xmath59 .",
    "since hopping rate is small ( that is , hops are rare ) , we can assume that the duration or lifetime of a hop ( instanton popping up ) is infinitesimally small .",
    "in the above equation , @xmath60 in the above theory the length scale of the greens function is given by the lindemann length @xmath29 where as the length scale of @xmath55 is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the random first order transition theory gives us the estimate of @xmath22 , that is the spatial extent of the instanton and also the rate at which the instantons pop up that is @xmath48 or more properly its distribution . the latter should be related to the waiting time distribution of hopping , as discussed by de michele and leporini @xcite .",
    "since @xmath61 , @xmath62 has a much slower decay with @xmath63 than @xmath64 which implies that the product decays slowly with @xmath63 .",
    "the propagator @xmath62 should be just the short time part of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "now we can write , @xmath65    as mentioned earlier , the length scale of the greens function is determined by the lindemann length @xmath29 .",
    "if we neglect its frequency dependence then the greens function can be written as , @xmath66 .      in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the calculation of the hopping rate @xmath58 from the rfot theory .",
    "as has been discussed before , the hopping rate of an instanton is connected to the free energy barrier , which in turn is connected to the configurational entropy of the system @xcite and an asymptotic form of that is given by eq.[barrier ] .",
    "note that , in glasses , we need the interface energy between two alternative amorphous packings and not between two thermodynamic phases , like a solid and a delocalized uniform liquid .",
    "the alternative phases become more alike at @xmath13 .",
    "the interfacial energy ( surface tension ) that enters in the calculation of the instanton barrier is smaller at @xmath13 than at lower temperature .",
    "this effect has been discussed by lubchenko and wolynes who termed it as barrier softening .",
    "a rigorous estimate of the barrier requires complex replica instanton calculations as recently outlined by franz @xcite and by dzero , schmalian and wolynes @xcite .",
    "an alternative method motivated by variational reasoning proposed by lubchenko and wolynes is to write a simple interpolation formula for the free energy which allows the system to choose the smallest available barrier , and is given by @xcite ,    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the surface energy terms at @xmath16 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "@xmath28 gives an estimate of temperature at which a soft crossover to the onset of activated transport takes place or the temperature at which the barrier disappears when approached from below .",
    "the expression for the surface energy at @xmath16 is , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the surface tension coefficient and @xmath72 is the molecular bead - size which refers to the size of the quasi - spherical parts of any a spherical molecule .",
    "the bead count b for each molecule is also be calculated within rfot theory .",
    "the expression for the surface energy at @xmath28 is , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the excess free energy density computed from the density functional .",
    "note that eq.[bsoft ] tends to @xmath68 as @xmath77 and similarly , to @xmath69 as @xmath78 . from the above expression of the barrier , the critical barrier free energy , @xmath79 , can be calculated as the maximum value of @xmath80 .",
    "microscopic calculation giving @xmath28 can then be used with eq.[bsoft ] to calculate the value of viscosity , @xmath81 , ( where @xmath82 is the viscosity at the melting temperature , @xmath3 and is obtained from experiments ) . rather than carry out completely microscopic calculations , lubchenko and wolynes used this approach to fit the experimental values of viscosity , where the values of the transition temperature @xmath28 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are used as the fitting parameters .",
    "@xmath16 is obtained from thermodynamics .",
    "for example , @xmath85 is known to be 175k for salol .    for our calculation of the hopping rate @xmath58",
    ", we use eq.[bsoft ] with the fitted values of @xmath28 and @xmath83 from lubchenko and wolynes @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the timescale of the system at the melting point , @xmath3 which is taken from experimentally known value @xcite .",
    "the above expression would predict that rate of hopping becomes of the order of hours at @xmath88 and vanishes at @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we also need an estimate of the size of the hopping region @xmath22 which has a temperature dependence and is equated to the @xmath41 value where in eq.[bsoft ] , f(r)=0 .",
    "in the last section we have evaluated the change in the dynamic structure factor due to hopping alone . in this section",
    "we incorporate this effect along with mode coupling feedback terms in the full density - density correlation function in a self - consistent manner .",
    "as mentioned earlier mct describes well the dynamics for a moderately supercooled system .",
    "it also works well for a deeply supercooled system confined within a single free energy minimum .",
    "these features are preserved when the hopping term or instanton vertex is added . in the idealized mct , the equation of motion for the dynamic structure factor,@xmath90",
    "is first simplified by neglecting the coupling between different wave vectors and considering the contribution from the static and dynamic quantities at a single wave number , @xmath91 , ( @xmath12 is the wavenumber where the peak of the structure factor appears ) .",
    "the idealized mct equation can be written as @xcite , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the normalized density time correlation function .",
    "this integro - differential equation has an unusual structure but it can be solved numerically and many of its properties are now analytically understood .",
    "the frequency of the free oscillator can be approximated as , @xmath94 and the damping constant , @xmath95 , which is the short time part of the memory kernel , is taken to be proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "this is because randomizing collisions occur in lennard - jones liquids on nearly the same timescale as the vibrations .",
    "the fourth term on the left hand side has the form of a memory kernel and its strength is controlled by the dimensionless coupling constant which can be taken to be , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "it is useful to transform to the laplace frequency plane , where the laplace transform is defined as @xmath99 $ ] . now",
    "the equation can be rewritten as ,    @xmath100    where the longitudinal viscosity @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 \\label { etal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equations are nonlinear in nature and when eq.[fqtleu ] is solved numerically or eqs.[fqtmcts ] and [ etal ] are solved self consistently for different values of @xmath103 , a dynamical arrest of the liquid structural relaxation was predicted at @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath13 is always higher than @xmath2 .",
    "the origin for this inconsistency is the exclusion of the hopping motion in the perturbative mct dynamics .    hopping and continuous motion are essentially two distinct channels for the structural relaxation in a supercooled liquid ,",
    "although they get coupled due to self - consistency , as described below . in the deeply supercooled regime these two styles of motion are usually well separated in their timescales . thus to include hopping in the dynamics of structural relaxation , as a first approximation , valid in the deeply supercooled regime , the full intermediate scattering function can be written as a product of two functions @xcite , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the mode coupling part and @xmath107 is the contribution from the hopping motion , which is already discussed in the last subsection .",
    "we now derive the equation for @xmath106 consistent with eq.[fqthop ] . to begin with ,",
    "note that the equation of motion @xmath108 should remain the same as @xmath109 ( eq.[fqtleu ] ) but due to the presence of hopping , the memory function will now be modified .",
    "the memory function , which is the longitudinal viscosity , is now determined by the full dynamic structure factor which is given by eq.[fqthop ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath108 is now solved self consistently with the full dynamic structure factor , @xmath110 , and the equation of motion is written as , @xmath111 note that for simplicity we have removed explicit @xmath63 dependence in the above equation and all the quantities are calculated at @xmath91 . although , the structure of eq.[fqtleu ] and eq.[fqtmod ] are quite similar , the memory function in the former is calculated using only @xmath112 whereas in the later it is calculated using the full intermediate scattering function , @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath113 is now dependent on the hopping motion .",
    "the equation in the laplace frequency plane , for the modified @xmath114 remains the same as eq.[fqtmcts ] , except that the ideal longitudinal viscosity @xmath101 is replaced by the following longitudinal viscosity given by ,    @xmath115 \\label { etalmod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see at this order , the longitudinal viscosity is modified which in turn modifies the decay of @xmath108 .",
    "combining eq.[fqthop ] and eq.[fqtmod ] we can now write a equation of motion for the full structure factor , @xmath24 .",
    "the equation becomes simple when @xmath26 can be approximated as an exponential with time scale @xmath116 . in the limit of small @xmath117 the equation of motion for @xmath24",
    "can be written as ,    @xmath118 = 0   \\label{schm1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effects of hopping motion in the full structural relaxation can be incorporated directly in the frequency plane which is suggested by eq.[fhop ] and eq.[fqtmcts ] . exploiting the strict parallelism of hopping and convective motion",
    ", these two equations can be combined to write an extended equation for the dynamic structure factor in the frequency plane as ,    @xmath119    where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is given by eq.[etalmod ] .",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath123 are the contributions to the rate of relaxation from mct and hopping modes , respectively , and they act as two parallel channels for the decay of @xmath24 . at high temperature and low density @xmath124 , thus the decay of @xmath24 is determined primarily by the mct term .",
    "but as we approach @xmath13 , the relaxation of @xmath125 slows down which increases the longitudinal viscosity value ( given by eq.[etal ] ) .",
    "this in turn causes @xmath122 to decrease much faster than @xmath123 at low frequency .",
    "now if we neglect the frequency dependence of @xmath117 then the equation of motion for @xmath24 for small @xmath117 value can be written as , @xmath126 = 0   \\label{schm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that as expected , while eq.[schm2 ] has similar structure as eq.[schm1 ] , the memory function is different and the consequence of this will be discussed later .",
    "the second scheme ( given by eq.[fqt2s ] ) appears to be rather similar to extended mode coupling theory of gotze and sjogren@xcite . in the extended mct",
    "the current contribution is incorporated in the memory kernel .",
    "the modified memory kernel leads to an extra decay channel of the dynamic structure factor thus successfully predicting the decay of @xmath24 below @xmath13 .",
    "the rate of decay for the second channel , @xmath127 , is called the rate due to the hopping mode .",
    "however , note that there is no direct connection between the expression of @xmath127 in the gotze - sjogren @xcite analysis and the hopping motion .",
    "since the microscopic calculation of @xmath127 can never predict a zero hopping rate they used @xmath127 as a fitting parameter to explain the experimental results .",
    "for this paper we solved eqs.[fqtleu ] , [ fqtmod],[schm1 ] and [ schm2 ] are solved numerically .",
    "although in principle eqs.[fqt2s]-[mem2s ] can be solved self consistently with eq.[etalmod ] in an iterative way , it requires a very large number of iterations to converge near the glass transition temperature .",
    "an alternative way is to numerically solve directly eq.[schm2 ] .",
    "both these calculations were done for a model system and for concreteness were applied to a specific molecular system , salol .      in the numerical calculations of the schematic model system",
    ", we took @xmath128 , and @xmath129 fixed .",
    "we varied @xmath103 between .1 - 1 , knowing that @xmath13 is reached for @xmath130 and varied @xmath117 from 0.01 to 0.0001 .    in * figure 1",
    "* we plot both the idealized mct result ( given by eq.[fqtleu ] ) and the modified full @xmath24 ( given by eq.[fqthop ] ) dynamic structure factor against log(t ) .",
    "we see that although the ideal mct saturates to a plateau value , the extended theory exhibits a hopping induced decay following the mct plateau value  the duration of the plateau depends on the rate of hopping .    in * figure 2 * we plot the total @xmath24 and @xmath131 against time .",
    "the plot shows that hopping not only leads to the decay of the total @xmath24 ( given by eq.[fqthop ] ) , but it also slows down the growth of the longitudinal viscosity thus facilitating the structural relaxation even through the mode coupling channel .",
    "the long time behavior of @xmath132 and @xmath133 are plotted against time in * figure 3 * , for @xmath130 and @xmath134 .",
    "the semilog plot shows straight lines in the long time with different slopes for the mct part and the total dynamic structure factor , thus indicating that both the functions are exponential in the long time but with somewhat different time constants as evident in figure 2 .",
    "next we compare the two different schemes at @xmath104 ( that is , for @xmath130 ) and for @xmath134 .",
    "the solution of eq.[schm1 ] and eq.[schm2 ] are plotted in * figure 4 * against log(t ) .",
    "both the approximate schemes provide similar results but the first scheme ( eq.[schm1 ] ) shows a faster decay implying that hopping has a stronger effect at this level .",
    "a comparison between eq.[schm1 ] and eq.[schm2 ] shows that although the structures of the equations are similar , in the memory function of eq.[schm1 ] there is an extra product with @xmath25 which eventually leads to a faster decay of the total function as seen in the figure .",
    "the advantage of the first approximate scheme is that we can separately calculate the mct part of the dynamic structure factor and can then demonstrate explicitly how hopping induces a decay of @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that hopping opens up continuous diffusion channels in the system .",
    "in the schematic calculation we have independently varied @xmath103 and @xmath117 while keeping parameters @xmath96 and @xmath95 constant . in real systems",
    "all of these are functions of density and temperature and needs to varied simultaneously .",
    "although the temperature dependence of @xmath96 and @xmath95 are not too strong but @xmath103 depends more strongly on t and @xmath117 is expected to depend more strongly than exponential on @xmath136 .",
    "this means that as we increase the timescale of hopping ( which is achieved by lowering the temperature ) , the @xmath103 value also increases .",
    "thus for real systems , unlike as shown in figure 1 , as @xmath116 gets stretched , the mct plateau value also should increase somewhat .",
    "this is consistent with density functional theory of the aperiodic solid . in the next subsection",
    "we apply our theory to a real system chosen as salol and include these effects .",
    "salol ( phenyl salicylate ) is a fragile glass forming substance .",
    "it is intra - molecularly hydrogen bonded , a van der walls system which is considered as a model substance for the study of glass transition and molecular mobility in the supercooled liquid . to perform the microscopic calculations , we need to map the system into a lennard - jones system and for that we need the molecular diameter and the well depth .",
    "although the shape of the molecule is not spherical we can calculate a hard sphere diameter @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "note that in the rfot theory the elementary particles in the system are not the molecules but beads and each molecule is made up of certain number of beads .",
    "we thus need to estimate the bead size _",
    "a_. use of the rfot theory ( with softening ) for the fit of the viscosity leads to the number of beads in a salol molecule to be 6.29 @xcite .",
    "equating the volume of the molecule with the volume of 6.29 beads , we get the hard sphere bead size @xmath138 which for the present calculation we equate to the lennard - jones bead size _ a_. next we need to estimate the temperature scaling which will be equivalent to the lennard - jones well depth @xmath139 . to obtain the temperature scaling we use the fact that for reduced lennard - jones system the mode coupling transition is known to take place at reduced density , @xmath140 and reduced temperature , @xmath141 .",
    "we are not aware of any reported density value of the salol system , but a reduced temperature @xmath142 seems to be a reasonable value when compared with simulation results @xcite . for a salol system",
    "it is known that the mode coupling transition temperature , @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "thus the temperature is to be scaled by , @xmath144 .    .",
    "in this table we present the value of the parameters calculated .",

    "the hopping rate varies strongly with temperature . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     now that we know the molecular and the thermodynamic parameters of the lennard - jones system , we can calculate the various parameter values in the integral equation that we need for a microscopic calculation , namely , for the mct part , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath97 , where @xmath146 @xcite . instead of microscopically calculating the short time part of the memory kernel , @xmath95",
    ", we again take it to be proportional to @xmath96 with the proportionality factor assumed to be unity ( as our schematic model study ) .",

    "we find that @xmath96 and @xmath95 have a weak temperature dependence which is reflected in figure 5 in the near invariance of the short time dynamics at all the three temperatures . on the other hand , although @xmath103 shows a weak temperature dependence but a small variation in @xmath103 leads to a substantial change in the dynamics .",
    "above @xmath130 the increase in its magnitude leads to an increase of the plateau value .",

    "experiments show that the structural relaxation in a supercooled liquid exhibits rich dynamics over many time and length scales .",
    "often the physical origin of these different dynamics are quite disparate .",
    "to explain the dynamics of the liquid over the whole temperature regime under a single theoretical framework has been a challenge .",

    "<S> a unified treatment of structural relaxation in a deeply supercooled glassy liquid is developed which extends the existing mode coupling theory ( mct ) by incorporating the effects of activated events by using the concepts from the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the decay of the dynamic structure factor is modified by localized activated events ( called instantons ) which lead to the spatial reorganization of molecules in the region where the instanton pops up . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton vertex added to the usual mct depicts the probability and consequences of such an event which can be derived from the random first order transition theory . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex is proportional to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the configurational entropy . </S>",
    "<S> close to the glass transition temperature , @xmath2 , since @xmath1 is diminishing , the activated process slows beyond the time window and this eventually leads to an arrest of the structural relaxation as expected for glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the combined treatment describes the dynamic structure factor in deeply supercooled liquid fairly well , with a hopping dominated decay following the mct plateau .    </S>",
    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering has given detailed structural information on how transport in liquids changes as they are cooled in the glassy state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many of the structural details are well described by mode coupling theory ( mct ) but that approach does not describe well the dynamics of the deeply supercooled state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory of glass explains this lacuna of mct @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how rfot theory can bridge the gap between the onset of glassy dynamics at high temperatures and the low temperature behavior and thus provide a unified view of the structural dynamics in deeply supercooled region . over the last few decades , experimental and theoretical studies on the phenomenological aspects of the glass transition </S>",
    "<S> have been the subject of a vast scientific literature . </S>",
    "<S> a glass forming liquid is characterized by its ability to circumvent crystallization on rapid cooling to a temperature well below its freezing temperature @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to crystal formation what is most remarkable about solidification into an amorphous state is that the structure changes accompanying vitrification are either very small or unobservable . </S>",
    "<S> however , on passage through supercooled regime the dynamic and thermodynamic behavior of the liquid exhibits a number of anomalies as it eventually transforms to an amorphous solid , called a glass .    </S>",
    "<S> the density - density correlation function at finite wave vector probed by neutron scattering , @xmath4 for a system approaching glass transition first decays via a fast microscopic process which is followed by a plateau in the intermediate time . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics while approaching the plateau is non - exponential , power law in nature and is called @xmath5 relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale of the @xmath5 relaxation is predicted to show a power law divergence . </S>",
    "<S> the decay from the plateau known as the initial @xmath6 relaxation is also given by a power law , known as von schweidler law . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent in the @xmath5 regime and the initial @xmath6 relaxation are different in value but related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the slow @xmath6 relaxation which appears at long times is described by an stretched exponential or kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) function @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies at @xmath2 are known experimentally to be correlated . </S>",
    "<S> one experimentally finds a sharp rise in the measured heat capacity of a liquid during heating which follows prior cooling at a constant rate@xcite , the cycle being well extended on either sides of the glass transition region . </S>",
    "<S> the over shoot of the heat capacity is taken to be a thermodynamic signature of a glass to liquid transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , what lies at the heart of glass transition is the dramatic slowing down of molecular motion that occurs progressively on cooling after the plateau in the inelastic structure factor appears . </S>",
    "<S> this is manifested by a phenomenal increase in shear viscosity @xmath7 ( also the characteristic structural relaxation time @xmath8 ) by several orders of magnitude for a relatively modest decrease of temperature ( by few tens of degrees ) . </S>",
    "<S> the glass transition seen in the laboratory is in fact best described as a kinetic phenomenon which marks the falling out of the equilibrium due to the inability of molecular rearrangement within the experimental timescale as temperature t is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> a conventional definition of the transition temperature @xmath2 is the temperature at which the viscosity , @xmath7 reaches a value @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mode coupling theory makes detailed predictions of the temperature dependence of the time evolution of the density - density correlation function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of a plateau in the neutron scattering is one of the important predictions of the ideal mode coupling theory . at a quantitative level both the emergence of a plateau in the dynamic structure factor at high temperature and the exponential slowing of the dynamics at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> are also explained by the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory @xcite . in the high temperature limit , rfot contains the essential elements of mct as a stability limit . </S>",
    "<S> while idealized mct can also correctly predict the power law dynamics in the @xmath5 and the initial @xmath6 relaxation regime and the relation between the two exponents in these two regimes , it fails to explain the slow @xmath6 relaxation which appears at long times . </S>",
    "<S> mct strictly applied , predicts a premature arrest of the decay of the density - density correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical plateau of mct was contemporaneously obtained by a variety of static approaches based on self - consistent phonon calculations and density functional theory which form the origin of the rfot theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mct would appear to predict a dynamic arrest of the liquid structural relaxation , arising solely from a nonlinear feedback mechanism on the memory function . </S>",
    "<S> this feedback mechanism was first proposed by geszti @xcite to describe the growth of viscosity in a previtrification region and involves a self - consistent calculation of the dynamical correlation function and transport coefficients . in rfot theory </S>",
    "<S> one sees the dynamic arrest is connected with the emergence of a mean field free energy landscape .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the mct , the essential driving force for glass transition is the slowing down of the density fluctuations near the wavenumber at @xmath10 where the static structure factor is sharply peaked . </S>",
    "<S> thus , prima facie the glass transition does not appear to be caused by a small wavenumber infra red singularity observable in the static structure factor , but rather it is a phenomenon where the intermediate wavenumbers are important , ( although a diverging length associated with the four point correlations is expected in the mean field rfot theory @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a softening of the heat mode near @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> kirkpatrick and wolynes @xcite showed that this mode coupling transition was equivalent to the transition to an aperiodic crystal predicted by the quasi - static theories . </S>",
    "<S> near the dynamical transition there is a general slowing down of all the dynamical quantities , and this slowing down is most effectively coupled to wavenumbers near @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the glass transition temperature predicted by mct always exceeds the laboratory @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation for this was pointed out by kirkpatrick and wolynes @xcite : since there are exponentially many aperiodic structures any single one of them is unstable to transformation to the other . at @xmath13 the system is not frozen because activated events allow interconnection between these structures . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath13 can be identified as a crossover temperature below which activated motions occur in which groups of particles move in a cooperative way over local barriers in the free energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulation studies have amply demonstrated this change of transport mechanism and have explicitly revealed the presence of such hopping motions in deeply supercooled liquids when the usual convective diffusive motions cease to exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simulations also show that these hopping events relax the local stress in the system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these properties of the activated events below @xmath13 can be represented by the random first order transition theory in a way superficially analogous to the theory of nucleation at random first order transition ( although there are some differences ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculation of fluctuations and transport in deeply supercooled or glassy medium are most easily made where the reference is an ideal glassy state and where the configurational entropy has vanished @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the barriers for activated dynamics vanish as the temperature of the system approaches the dynamical transition temperature from below much like at a spinodal . </S>",
    "<S> the barrier for activated events can be described as a nucleation phenomenon where the free energy change is a sum of the entropy change due to the formation of an entropy droplet and a surface term with a radius dependent surface energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more explicit view of the similarities and the differences from nucleation appears in the recent work of lubchenko and wolynes and the elegant analysis of biroli and bouchaud @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the supercooled regime , the nucleation free energy barrier is given by the following simple expression @xmath14 where @xmath1 is the configuration entropy of a single moving bead i.e equivalent spherical particle . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath15 arises from a specific microscopic calculation and reflects the entropy cost of localizing a particle to vibrate in the cage , explicitly observed in the plateau of the dynamic structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> if one approximates @xmath1 near the kauzmann temperature @xmath16 by @xmath17 , one then obtains the empirical vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) law , with a relation between the liquid s fragility and the heat capacity jump , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression agrees well with experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq.[barrier ] is an asymptotic form of the barrier , valid only near @xmath16 and as will be discussed later , if we take into account the barrier softening effect near @xmath13 then the value of the barrier will be considerably smaller than that given by eq.[barrier ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is found to be stronger as we move away from @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> once the estimation of the barrier height is made the relaxation time @xmath8 is calculated using , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the random first order phase transition theory also provides an explanation of the dominant source of non - exponentiality in relaxation dynamics in terms of distribution of the configuration entropy of the activated droplet . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes a gaussian distribution of the barrier , then the standard deviation of the barrier height at @xmath2 also turns out to be related to the specific heat discontinuity of the supercooled liquid . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation between nonexponentiality and @xmath20 is observed in the laboratory @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we use the concepts of mode coupling theory and random first order transition theory to include both the convective diffusional motion ( given by mct ) and the hopping motion ( described by rfot ) in the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thus the present treatment also correlates the kinetic anomalies ( like stretching of the relaxation time ) with the thermodynamic anomalies ( jump in the heat capacity ) primarily through the rfot theory . </S>",
    "<S> here we first discuss the effect of hopping alone on the structural density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of hopping and the size of the region involved in hopping are calculated from rfot theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that hopping opens up a new channel for the structural relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> next we present the equation of motion of the density - density correlation function where the diffusional and the hopping motions are considered as two parallel channels for the structural relaxation in the liquid . in the same spirit as in the case of the idealized mct the new equation of motion which now has hopping motion in it , is calculated self - consistently with the longitudinal viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback mechanism which gave rise to the divergence of the viscosity in the idealized mct @xcite is also present in our theory but due to the presence of hopping , the divergence is shifted to a lower temperature where the rfot hopping rate now finally vanishes only as the configurational entropy goes to zero . in our proposed equation of motion the diffusional and </S>",
    "<S> the hopping motions are considered as parallel channels for the density relaxation . in the first approximate scheme we write the total density correlation in the time plane and in the second approximate scheme it is written in the frequency plane . </S>",
    "<S> we show that not only both the approximations ( although they appear to be quite different ) lead to similar effects on the density - density correlation function , although . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted longtime decays are somewhat different .    before discussing our own theoretical scheme we would like to mention that das and mazenko @xcite in their fluctuating nonlinear hydrodynamic theory and later gotze and sjogren @xcite in their extended mct have elegantly demonstrated that in the relaxation kernel ( memory function ) , in addition to the density contribution , if a coupling to the current modes is also included , then below @xmath13 , the dynamic structure factor decays from the plateau value in the long time . </S>",
    "<S> gotze and sjogren @xcite have shown that this modification eventually leads to a parallel decay channel of the dynamic structure factor which eliminates the ergodic to non - ergodic transition at @xmath13 . however , although the authors call this extra decay channel a hopping mode , there is no microscopic connection made in those theories to the single particle or collective hopping or the system crossing over a free energy barrier in the free energy landscape . in those treatments , the strength and the timescale of this so called hopping mode </S>",
    "<S> was determined by fitting to experimental results , and an arrhenius temperature dependence of the rate of `` hopping '' was assumed in this fitting . </S>"
