    "in recent years one of the most important technical and conceptual advances in the lattice discretisation of qcd has been the discovery and practical implementation of chirally symmetric lattice fermion actions . while in the continuum limit chiral symmetry is expected to be recovered in any lattice discretisation of fermions , the new formulation guarantees that it already holds exactly at non - zero lattice spacings .",
    "this has important practical consequences opening new possibilities in the study of qcd with light quarks .",
    "by now , there are several different implementations of chirally symmetric lattice fermions ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but being relatively new , the properties of these implementations have not yet been fully explored .",
    "certainly many questions are still to be answered before chiral fermions can reach their full potential .",
    "in particular , speed , scaling properties and locality are just some of the issues that clearly play an important role in this context and have to be optimized before chiral fermions can make their way into realistic full ( unquenched ) qcd simulations .    in the present paper",
    "we propose to study a simple variant of one of the formulations of chiral fermions , namely the overlap @xcite .",
    "the basic overlap construction starts with any `` reasonable '' dirac operator , @xmath1 , that is used as a `` kernel '' in the overlap construction .",
    "the overlap operator is defined in terms of @xmath1 by the formula @xmath2^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } ,   \\hspace{1 cm } a = 1+s - d_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a real parameter . in the original overlap construction @xmath1",
    "was the wilson lattice dirac operator .",
    "it is by now clear , however , that properties of the overlap depend strongly on what operator is used for @xmath1 @xcite-@xcite . in the construction",
    "we propose here , @xmath1 is the clover improved dirac operator with the tree - level value of @xmath4 and smeared fat gauge links @xcite .",
    "this construction is neither particularly imaginative , nor is it new . in particular ,",
    "fattened gauge links are used in more complicated overlap kernels @xcite and the type of fat link clover overlap ( fco ) we propose here has already been used to estimate the quark - mass dependence of the unquenched topological susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that the evaluation of the fco  although a slightly different version thereof  is roughly two times faster than the wilson overlap , due to the better condition number of @xmath0 .",
    "the reason why we propose to study some properties of the fco in more detail is that it might represent an optimal compromise between much more complicated choices of @xmath1 and the wilson overlap . in the present paper",
    "we shall explicitly demonstrate that the fco action has the following advantages compared to the wilson overlap ( wo ) .",
    "* already after a very small amount of fattening , lattice configurations are smooth enough that the parameter @xmath3 does not have to be tuned , it can be set to zero independently of the gauge coupling .",
    "this feature also makes it possible to check that the localisation range of of @xmath5 does not change as the gauge coupling is varied . *",
    "the operator @xmath0 is much better conditioned which translates into savings of a factor of 25 in computing time when evaluating its inverse square root . * in contrast to the wo @xcite , the fco precisely reproduces the continuum wave function of quark zero modes in the background of smooth instantons down to an instanton size of one lattice spacing .",
    "the downside is , purists might object , that using fat gauge links might affect short distance properties .",
    "this however is not a real problem , since very little fattening turns out to be enough to ensure the above listed good properties .",
    "we shall also explicitly check how non - local the ape smearing is and find that the needed smearing is actually more localized than the overlap itself .",
    "even better , one step of `` hyp '' smearing @xcite , a smearing that stays within a hypercube , is already enough to guarantee the above listed good properties .    in section [ sec : l ] we test the locality of both the ape smearing and the overlap operator .",
    "we find that the ( exponential ) localisation range of the fco is essentially independent of the gauge coupling of the background gauge fields in the range of ( wilson ) @xmath6 , where we tested it .",
    "the most important consequence of this is that the fco action is very likely to remain local in the continuum limit .",
    "in fact , at these gauge couplings the localisation range of the fco turns out to be somewhat smaller than that obtained for the wo after optimizing the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we also discuss the possible role of small eigenvalues of @xmath0 in the locality properties of the overlap .",
    "we find that although the spectral density of @xmath0 is divergent at zero , small eigenmodes occur with a finite probability , decreasing towards the continuum limit .",
    "they seem to be related to gauge field defects living on the scale of the cut - off and the localisation of the corresponding eigenmodes stays constant in lattice units as the continuum limit is approached .",
    "therefore , they are very unlikely to affect the locality of the overlap in the continuum limit .",
    "in section [ sec : t ] we study the topological properties of quenched gauge fields with the fco operator .",
    "we demonstrate that  unlike the wilson overlap  the fco reproduces continuum instanton zero mode wave functions down to lattice instanton sizes of @xmath7 .",
    "we also discuss the criteria for a fermionic and a gauge field definition of the topological charge to satisfy the index theorem in the continuum limit . we find that the fco dirac operator and the boulder charge satisfy these criteria",
    ". finally we present a high statistics computation of the quenched topological susceptibility using both definitions of the charge .",
    "locality is a crucial property of lattice actions since it guarantees that physics in the continuum limit is independent of the details of the discretisation ( universality ) .",
    "most of the conventional lattice qcd actions , both fermionic and gauge actions , are ultralocal .",
    "this means that they connect only degrees of freedom up to a finite distance measured in lattice units .",
    "it has been proved that there is no chirally symmetric lattice fermion action that is ultralocal @xcite , therefore if we insist on chiral symmetry , we have to settle with a weaker form of locality .",
    "we demand only that the matrix elements of the operator should fall off exponentially with the distance measured in lattice units and that this exponent should be non - zero in the continuum limit .",
    "this weaker form of locality is still enough for universality . in the present section we study the locality of the two ingredients of our fco action , the smeared gauge links and the fermion action itself .      the smearing that we use on the gauge links entering the fermion operator",
    "consists of two steps .",
    "first , each link is replaced with a linear combination of itself and the six shortest staples around it , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the product of gauge links along the path @xmath10 , the staple and @xmath11 is a real parameter . since a linear combination of su(3 )",
    "elements is in general not an element of the group , in the second step @xmath12 is projected back to the gauge group by minimizing tr@xmath13 for all possible @xmath14 su(3 ) .",
    "one sweep of this procedure through the whole lattice will be referred to as one step of ape smearing . in the course of a sweep",
    "the new smeared links are always constructed from the original ones without immediate replacement .",
    "the original gauge links are replaced with the new smeared ones only after a full sweep through the lattice has been completed . therefore , the procedure is independent of the order in which the gauge links are smeared and it is also strictly ultralocal .    since any finite number of ape smearing steps is ultralocal , from a conceptual point of view operators constructed from smeared links",
    "are as good as any other local operator , as long as the number of smearing steps is kept constant in the continuum limit .",
    "there is , however , a more practical issue . in actual simulations , it is desirable to keep the `` size '' of operators much smaller than the inverse mass of the heaviest physical particle in the system , otherwise strong scaling violations can be expected . for this reason , in the present section we check how the locality of smearing depends on the number of smearing steps and the smearing coefficient , @xmath11 .    the simplest way of doing that is by monitoring how a local disturbance in the gauge field is propagated into gauge invariant quantities measured at a distance from the disturbance .",
    "we choose the most local disturbance , a random change of a single gauge link and the simplest gauge invariant observable , the plaquette .",
    "after randomly flipping a single gauge link , we compute the modulus of the difference between each smeared plaquette of the original and the changed configuration .",
    "let us denote this quantity , averaged over all 24 plaquettes at site @xmath15 , by @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in how @xmath16 changes with the distance from the flipped link at @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the quantity we look at is @xmath18 , the average of @xmath16 over spherical shells of radius @xmath19 , normalized such that @xmath20 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : aper ] @xmath18 versus @xmath21 is shown , averaged over a set of 50 quenched wilson @xmath22 @xmath23 lattice configurations . in this computation @xmath11 was ( arbitrarily ) set to @xmath24 and the number of smearing steps shown are 2,4,6,10,16 and 24 .",
    "the important feature we have to notice here is that for moderate smearing ( about @xmath25 ) , @xmath18 decays faster than exponentially over the whole range where it is non - zero .",
    "the starting exponents , that were fit in the range @xmath26 vary from 4.0 to 1.3 for 2 and 10 steps of smearing respectively .",
    "notice that the actual decay rate of @xmath18 for @xmath27 is much faster than that .",
    "if more than about 10 smearing steps are applied , the function @xmath18 slowly starts to develop a `` shoulder '' that gradually extends to larger distances .",
    "in other words this means that for more than 10 smearing steps the logarithmic derivative of @xmath18 is not monotonous ; the initial short distance exponential decay rate slows down at medium distances of @xmath28 before accelerating again above that .    from this behaviour",
    "we can conclude that for most physical quantities , operators built of 2 - 4-smeared links should be quite safe , and even as much as 10 steps of smearing might not be too severe . going beyond this point ,",
    "however , smearing will start to affect medium distance properties and might have an adverse effect on spectral quantities .    for comparison we also plotted @xmath18 for one step of hyp smearing that is strictly localized within a hypercube ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : aper ] ) .",
    "regarding the properties of the smeared configurations , hyp1 is roughly equivalent to ape4 .",
    "the initial fall - off of @xmath29 is slightly slower than that of ape4 , however , @xmath29 vanishes for @xmath30 .",
    "we also briefly experimented with ape smearing coefficients other than @xmath31 and confirmed the previously established rule of thumb that the extent of ape smearing can be adequately characterized with @xmath11 times the number of smearing steps is not bigger than its critical value of @xmath32 , which will always be the case here . ] . to illustrate this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig : aper_0.75 ] we compare the behaviour of @xmath18 obtained with 10 steps of @xmath31 and 6 steps of @xmath33 ape smearing .",
    "we now turn to testing the locality of the overlap operator itself .",
    "the simplest way to measure how its matrix elements fall - off with the distance is to create a delta source @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 refer to dirac and colour indices ) and compute how @xmath37 decays with the distance from the source .    in the only available detailed study of the locality of the wilson overlap , the so called `` taxi driver distance '' ,",
    "the sum of the moduli of the coordinate differences @xmath38 was used and the function @xmath39 was computed @xcite . to be able to compare our results to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , we first also compute this quantity for the fco action .    before presenting our results , however , we have to briefly discuss how we choose the arbitrary parameter @xmath3 in the overlap construction .",
    "if the wilson action is used , the parameter @xmath3 has to be optimized . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath3 is an arbitrary `` cut '' that controls whether a given real eigenvalue of the wilson operator between the physical modes and the doublers will become a low physical mode or a doubler of the resulting overlap .",
    "it is clearly advantageous , both from the practical and the conceptual point of view , to set @xmath3 in a way to minimize the number of small eigenvalues of @xmath0 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g.at wilson @xmath40 the exponent governing the decay of @xmath41 can vary between @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath3 changes from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . in the continuum limit",
    ", the optimal value of @xmath3 is expected to go to zero .",
    "since the localisation range of @xmath5 depends strongly on @xmath3 , it is not an easy task to verify numerically that @xmath5 remains local in the continuum , i.e. that the exponent goes to a non - zero constant . to this end , one would need to compute the optimal exponent at every value of @xmath46 and verify the statement for that .",
    "while the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite are encouraging in this respect , such a complete study was not undertaken there .",
    "moreover , it is not guaranteed that the localization and the density of small eigenvalues of @xmath0 are optimal at the same @xmath3 .",
    "the situation with the fco action is much simpler . even after 2 - 4 steps of ape smearing the gauge field",
    "is smooth enough that @xmath3 can be safely set to the continuum value , zero , regardless of the gauge coupling ( at least as long as the quenched wilson @xmath47 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ovrange ] we compare the function @xmath41 on three @xmath23 quenched gauge ensembles .",
    "the first two were generated at ( wilson ) @xmath48 and one with @xmath49 .",
    "the kernel used for the overlap here was the clover action with the perturbative value of @xmath4 and the gauge links have been 4 times ape smeared with @xmath31 ( ape4 ) .",
    "the two data sets lie so close to each other that they are hardly distinguishable by the naked eye .",
    "we also verified that @xmath41 is the same on two other gauge ensembles with intermediate @xmath46 values .",
    "this means that a @xmath50 decrease in the lattice spacing resulted in no discernible change of the localisation of the overlap ; asymptotically it decays as @xmath51 with the same exponent , @xmath52 . for comparison",
    "we also included in the same figure the conventional wilson overlap on unsmeared @xmath40 gauge backgrounds . here",
    "the parameter @xmath3 was chosen to be 0.3 which is roughly the optimal value for localisation and an exponential fit yielded @xmath53 to facilitate the comparison of the exponents @xmath54 .",
    "we have to note , however that due to finite size effects , the obtained values do not coincide with the asymptotic exponent @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , they are accurate enough to assess the qualitative differences between various fermion actions . ]",
    "although the fco appears to be somewhat more local than the wilson overlap , the main point here is not this , but that in the case of the former , the range of the operator ( in lattice units ) can be seen to be independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "this strongly suggests that even on gauge backgrounds generated with the wilson action the fco stays local in the continuum limit .    to appreciate this statement ,",
    "let us recall what is known about the locality of the overlap . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that it is sufficient for its exponential localisation if the spectrum of @xmath0 has a gap at zero .",
    "it was also suggested there that a finite gap might not be necessary , it might be enough if the continuous spectrum of @xmath0 is separated from zero .",
    "on the other hand , the spectrum is guaranteed to have a finite gap if the gauge field action restricts the plaquette values sufficiently close to unity everywhere .",
    "this condition , however , even in the continuum limit , is not necessarily satisfied for practically useful actions .",
    "although most practical gauge actions damp plaquette fluctuations exponentially in the gauge coupling , the number of plaquettes in a fixed physical volume also grows exponentially in the continuum limit .",
    "how the probability of a given plaquette fluctuation in a fixed physical volume will behave in the continuum limit , will depend on which of the two exponentials wins .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite therefore do not exclude the possibility that the overlap in gauge backgrounds generated with e.g.  the wilson action becomes non - local in the continuum limit .",
    "even though locality can be proved for special gauge actions , universality can not be used to argue that any other gauge action in the same universality class will also have the same property .",
    "this is because in principle , with a different gauge action , the overlap can be non - local and universality of the complete fermion gauge system is not guaranteed then .",
    ".the four gauge field ensembles used for the study of the spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath55 . the lattice spacing has been set with the sommer parameter @xmath56  fm and the wilson gauge couplings were tuned to keep the physical volume of the system fixed .",
    "the last column lists the spectral density of @xmath55 at zero . [",
    "tab : pars ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     at first sight property ( a ) might seem trivially true , but in fact there are examples when it does not hold .",
    "this is the case e.g.  in quenched su(2 ) gauge theory with the wilson action and the geometric charge .",
    "the dislocation problem @xcite , appearing there , is essentially equivalent to the violation of property ( a ) . whether ( a ) is satisfied in a particular case , depends both on the action and the charge operator .    in table",
    "[ tab : top ] we demonstrate how the probability of configurations with an `` ill defined '' charge changes with @xmath46 . for the fermionic definition , we listed the fraction of configurations on which the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath0 was below 0.5 ( 0.2 ) . for the gauge field definition we computed the fraction of configurations with a charge farther than 0.2 ( 0.1 ) from the nearest integer .",
    "according to all these criteria the charge appears to become more well - defined for weaker coupling .",
    "we emphasize that throughout this study the number of smearing steps was kept fixed at 10 ( and 8) for the fermionic ( and the gauge ) definition of the charge .",
    "it was also essential to keep the physical volume of the compared configurations constant as @xmath46 was increased .",
    "if our intuitive picture is correct , and the boundary between charge sectors is associated with localized small defects , we expect that in larger volumes the charge becomes ill defined more frequently ( at fixed @xmath46 ) .",
    "let us see whether our gauge and fermionic charge definition satisfy criterion ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qvsl ] we show a scatter plot of the difference between the fermionic and the gauge field charge versus the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath0 on 2000 gauge configurations obtained at two values of @xmath46 on the same physical volume .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath57 is larger than about @xmath58 , the two charge definitions are rather close .",
    "this means that ( b ) is also satisfied .",
    "interestingly enough , on these locally smooth gauge backgrounds there is a good correlation between small eigenmodes of @xmath0 and change of topology .",
    "we would like to remark that while the latter implies the former by continuity , the argument does not hold the other way round .",
    "it is not guaranteed that a small mode of @xmath0 implies that the gauge configuration is close to the boundary between charge sectors .",
    "in fact , on unsmeared configurations the density of small modes is much larger and it is possible that many or even most of these small modes are not related to topology .",
    "we also computed the quenched zero mode susceptibility @xmath59 with the ape10 fco action as well as the topological susceptibility @xmath60 with the ape8 boulder charge .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : susc ] .",
    "in addition to the ensembles listed in table [ tab : pars ] , here we also used a coarser ensemble of 1000 @xmath61 lattices with @xmath62 and a finer one of 200 @xmath63 lattices at @xmath64 . on the two coarsest ensembles the boulder charge was not computed , while on the finest one , we computed only the boulder charge .",
    "the physical volumes were chosen to be approximately the same , except for the @xmath23 @xmath65 ensemble where the volume was about two times bigger to test finite volume effects . although the fixed volumes @xmath66 @xmath67 are not particularly big , no finite size effects can be observed .",
    "after the discussion in the previous subsection , it does not come as a surprise that the boulder charge susceptibility and the overlap zero mode susceptibility appear to be compatible whenever both are available .",
    "there is no simple trend as to how the susceptibility changes with @xmath46 , most likely because our @xmath46 range at weak couplings is rather limited .",
    "for this reason we do not attempt a continuum extrapolation .",
    "our results , however , at the weakest two couplings are consistent with those of the other available high statistics chiral fermion computation of the quenched susceptibility @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we studied the properties of fat link clover overlap actions .",
    "the motivation came from the already known good properties of fat link clover actions @xcite .",
    "it turns out that if used in the overlap construction , much less smearing ( 2 - 4 steps of ape smearing or 1 step of hyp smearing ) is enough to guarantee a substantial improvement in several properties .",
    "in particular , we showed here that the localisation range of the fco action in quenched gauge backgrounds is independent of the gauge coupling in the range of wilson @xmath68 , suggesting that the fco remains local in the continuum limit .",
    "another advantage of the construction is that in contrast to the wilson overlap ( wo ) , the parameter @xmath3 does not need to be optimized , one can simply use the tree level value @xmath69 .",
    "the fco also turns out to be slightly more local than the wo at the optimal value of @xmath3 .",
    "the improvement in this respect , however , is not nearly as significant as in the case of more complicated fermion actions @xcite .",
    "smearing also improves the condition number of @xmath0 and results in a saving of a factor of 2 - 5 in cpu time when evaluating the overlap .",
    "finally , in contrast to the wo , the fco action correctly describes fermion zero mode wave functions of instantons as small as the cut - off .",
    "we explicitly studied the locality of the involved smearing .",
    "we found that 2 - 4 steps of ape smearing ( with a smearing coefficient of @xmath31 ) can be safely used ; the range of the smearing is bounded with an exponential with an exponent much bigger than 1 ( in lattice units ) .",
    "for some purposes , as much as 10 smearing steps might still be acceptable .",
    "probably the best compromise between locality and efficiency is hypercubic smearing that mixes only gauge degrees of freedom within a hypercube @xcite .",
    "we also studied the connection between small modes of @xmath0 and the locality of the overlap .",
    "smearing together with the clover term considerably reduces the density of low modes of @xmath0 but the spectral density still appears to be divergent at zero .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that the hermitian dirac operator @xmath70 has a non - vanishing spectral density at zero .",
    "our results show that small modes of @xmath71 ( or @xmath0 ) do not affect the locality of the overlap in practice .",
    "the reason for this is that the low modes are typically localized at the scale of the cut - off , their localisation ( in lattice units ) does not change as the lattice spacing shrinks , but their physical density rapidly decreases at the same time .",
    "low modes of @xmath0 can signal that the gauge field configuration is `` close '' to the boundary between topological sectors , as defined with the corresponding overlap .",
    "we also used the boulder charge ( a field theoretic definition ) to monitor whether the gauge field is close to a transition between charge sectors .",
    "we found that whenever the gauge field is far away from such a transition according to both the fermionic and the gauge field definition , the two charge definitions are always consistent .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of configurations close to the transition region becomes more rare as @xmath46 increases , while the physical volume stays fixed .",
    "this suggests that in the continuum limit the fco fermionic and boulder field theoretic charge satisfy the index theorem . in this connection we also discussed the general criteria for two charge definitions to give consistent results in the continuum limit .",
    "finally we also presented a high statistics computation of the quenched topological susceptibility with the fermionic definition involving the fco action .",
    "fat link clover overlap actions can represent the optimal compromise between complexity on the one hand and good physical properties and efficiency on the other hand .",
    "this might be the case also in future dynamical overlap simulations , especially if hybrid monte carlo can not be implemented with the overlap .",
    "i would like to thank the milc collaboration @xcite and the creators of the arpack package @xcite for making their code publicly available , as well as anna hasenfratz for discussions and for providing the code for hyp blocking .",

    "<S> we present a detailed study of the localisation of the fco and its connection to the density of low modes of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the wilson overlap , on quenched gauge backgrounds we do not find any dependence of the localization of the fco on the gauge coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the fco remains local in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> the fco also faithfully reproduces the zero mode wave functions of typical lattice instantons , not like the wilson overlap . </S>",
    "<S> after a general discussion of different lattice definitions of the topological charge we also show that the fco together with the boulder charge are likely to satisfy the index theorem in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a high statistics computation of the quenched topological susceptibility with the fco action .    </S>",
