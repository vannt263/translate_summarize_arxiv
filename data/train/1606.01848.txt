    "fifty years ago , kochen and specker @xcite answered the following question : is it possible that , independently of which is the quantum state , the quantum observables each possess a definite single value , regardless of whether they are measured or not ?",
    "the kochen  specker ( ks ) theorem states that this is impossible if the dimension of the underlying hilbert space is larger than two .",
    "one consequence of this theorem is the impossibility of reproducing quantum theory in terms of noncontextual hidden variable theories , defined as those in which the outcomes are independent of the context .",
    "a context is a set of mutually compatible quantum observables . in this sense ,",
    "quantum theory is said to exhibit contextuality .",
    "the original proof of the ks theorem had two other distinctive traits : ( i ) it only used a finite set of observables with two outcomes , where one outcome is represented by a rank - one projection onto a ray of the hilbert space .",
    "hereafter , as it is common in the literature , we will use ray as synonym of self - adjoint rank - one projection .",
    "( ii ) the set is ks - uncolorable , i.e. , it is impossible to assign values 1 or 0 to each ray while respecting that two orthogonal rays can not both have assigned 1 , and 1 must be assigned to exactly one of @xmath0 mutually orthogonal rays .",
    "these restrictions are motivated by the observation that orthogonal rays correspond to mutually exclusive outcomes of a sharp observable and @xmath0 mutually orthogonal rays correspond to an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive outcomes for a hilbert space of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "ks - uncolorable sets of rays are called ks sets @xcite .",
    "the original ks set had 117 rays in @xmath1 , which can be grouped in 132 contexts .",
    "there have been many efforts for finding simpler sets exhibiting state - independent contextuality ( sic ) .",
    "for instance , peres and mermin realized that , by considering observables not represented by rank - one projections and replacing ks uncolorability by a similar condition , one can find very compact sets of observables in @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "still , these sets can be rewritten in terms of ks sets @xcite .",
    "so far , it has been shown @xcite that the ks set of minimum cardinality occurs in @xmath2 and has 18 rays @xcite .",
    "it also has been proved @xcite that , in @xmath1 , the ks set with minimum cardinality has more than 22 and less than 32 rays @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the ks set with minimum number of contexts known occurs in @xmath4 and has seven contexts ( and 21 rays ) @xcite .",
    "a big step was the observation that sic based on rays does not need to rely on ks - uncolorable sets .",
    "it is enough that they lead to a state - independent violation of a noncontextuality inequality .",
    "this substantially simplifies the methods for revealing sic in @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , yu and oh singled out one set with 13 rays in @xmath1 @xcite . the optimal state - independent noncontextuality inequalities for this set were identified in ref .  .",
    "sets of rays having a state - independent violation of a non - contextuality inequality are called sic sets .",
    "recent experiments testing sic and an increasing number of applications , such as device - independent secure communication @xcite , local contextuality @xcite , bell inequalities revealing full nonlocality @xcite , state - independent quantum dimension witnessing @xcite , and state - independent hardware certification @xcite , have stimulated the interest in the following question : which is the minimal set of rays needed for sic ?",
    "it is known that , for @xmath1 , the answer is 13 @xcite , but it would be well possible that the minimal set occurs in some higher dimension , as it happens for ks sets . here",
    "we prove that this is not the case .",
    "the basis of our proof is a condition identified by ramanathan and horodecki @xcite to be necessary for any sic set in dimension @xmath0 , namely that the orthogonality graph @xmath5 of the set of rays has fractional chromatic number @xmath6 .",
    "the orthogonality graph of a sic set is the graph in which orthogonal rays are represented by adjacent vertices .",
    "a coloring of @xmath5 is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that adjacent vertices are associated with different colors .",
    "@xmath7 is the infimum of @xmath8 such that vertices have a set of @xmath9 associated colors , out of @xmath10 colors , where adjacent vertices have associated disjoint sets of colors .    instead of considering all possible sic sets of size @xmath11",
    ", we rather investigate all graphs with @xmath11 vertices .",
    "then , we consider the nondegenerate orthogonal representations ( ors ) of any graph @xmath5 . an or is an injection @xmath12 , mapping the vertices of @xmath5 to rays , such that adjacent vertices in @xmath5 are mapped to orthogonal rays . the or is faithful ( for ) if , conversely , any two orthogonal rays correspond to an edge of @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the smallest dimension of the hilbert space which still admits a fors of @xmath5 .",
    "it then follows from the ramanathan ",
    "horodecki condition that @xmath5 is the orthogonality graph of a sic set only if @xmath14 .",
    "our main results is then as follows .",
    "[ thm1 ] any graph @xmath5 with 12 or less vertices has @xmath15 .",
    "hence , according to quantum theory , no sic set with less than 13 rays exists .",
    "we proceed by an exhaustive search for a counterexample , examining all @xmath16 nonisomorphic graphs with up to 12 vertices . applying a cascade of filters",
    "we eventually discard all graphs and prove this way theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "we start by introducing the criteria for defining these filters and then explain our procedure providing intermediate results for each of the filters .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 and @xmath18 the sets of vertices and edges of @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the complement @xmath19 of @xmath5 is a graph that has the same vertices while the edges are the complemented set , i.e. , @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 .",
    "a subgraph @xmath22 of @xmath5 is any graph with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a subgraph is induced if @xmath25 is also a subgraph of @xmath19 .",
    "it is a simple observation that any ( f)or is also a ( f)or of any ( induced ) subgraph . defining @xmath26 analogously to @xmath27 , but for ors , @xcite , but there the minimum is taken without the restriction that the or is an injection .",
    "this yields slightly different properties . ]",
    "this proves the following .",
    "[ lem2 ] by definition , @xmath28 . if @xmath22 is a subgraph of @xmath5 , then @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath22 is an induced subgraph of @xmath5 , then @xmath30 .",
    "the union of two graphs @xmath31 consists of the disjoint union of the respective vertex sets and edge sets .",
    "the join @xmath32 of two graphs is the union of both graphs adding one edge between any pair @xmath33 .",
    "the graph @xmath34 with one vertex and no edge takes a special role in the following simple relations .",
    "[ lem3 ] for two graphs @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 , with the exceptions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    for @xmath42",
    "the relations are well - known , cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .  , sec .",
    "3.10 . for @xmath27 and @xmath26 and the first relation ,",
    "the maximum is at least a lower bound , since any ( f)or of @xmath31 must also be a ( f)or of @xmath35 and of @xmath36 .",
    "conversely , if at least one of the graphs has more than one vertex then also its ( f)or has at least dimension two .",
    "this ( f)or can then be transformed by a unitary rotation , such that the image of the ( f)ors of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are disjoint and also no rays are orthogonal .",
    "hence one can combine any two ( f)ors of @xmath35 and @xmath36 to a ( f)or in the larger of the dimensions of both ( f)ors . the second relation follows at once , noting that @xmath43 if and only if either @xmath44 and @xmath45 , or vice versa , or @xmath46 , or @xmath47 . hence @xmath12 is a ( f)or for @xmath32 if and only if it is a ( f)or for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the spans of @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] are mutually orthogonal .",
    "these relations are useful for our purposes since they imply that , if a graph or its complement is not connected and @xmath14 , then this must already be true for a subgraph of @xmath5 . hence in our search",
    "we only need to consider connected graphs the complement of whose are also connected",
    ". another important consequence of lemma  [ lem3 ] is that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the completely connected graph with @xmath52 vertices @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath53 as soon as @xmath54 is a subgraph of @xmath5 .",
    "a weaker form of this condition is that if @xmath51 is a subgraph of @xmath5 , then @xmath55 .",
    ".[tab1]list of graphs used for filtering via lemma  [ lem2 ] .",
    "the graphs @xmath56 are linear graphs of length @xmath57 , where @xmath58 leafs are added to vertex @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 is the circulant graph , where each vertex is connected to its @xmath62th- , ",
    ", @xmath63th - next neighbor . @xmath64 is the graph @xmath5 with one vertex removed .",
    "selected graphs are displayed in fig .",
    "_ graph6 _ is a standard graph data format widely used in computer software @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath27 is the smallest dimension of any faithful nondegenerate orthogonal representation .",
    "the last column shows the number of graphs remaining after filtering for the induced subgraph , cf .  main text . [ cols=\"^,^,<,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we apply all filters ( 1)(3.7 ) consecutively so that each filter reduces the number of candidate graphs .",
    "the numbers of graphs remaining after each step are shown in table  [ tab2 ] , for filters ( 1 ) , ( 2.1 ) , and ( 2.2 ) , and as a function of the number of vertices of the graph .",
    "the list of @xmath65 graphs remaining after filter ( 2.2 ) is available in _",
    "graph6_-format @xcite . for the filters ( 3.1)(3.7 )",
    ", we show in table  [ tab1 ] the total number of remaining graphs after each filter .",
    "no graph remains after applying all filters , which proves theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "contextuality is a fundamental feature of quantum observables and can be completely detached from any features of the quantum state of the system .",
    "this state - independent contextuality already occurs for the most elementary case of observables being sharp and having only two outcomes , one of which is nondegenerate ; such observables can be represented by rays in a hilbert space .",
    "here we have shown that state - independent contextuality with elementary observables requires at least 13 different observables by performing an exhaustive search over all cases with less observables . the yu  oh set is an example of such 13 observables and is already realizable on a three - level quantum system , which is the smallest quantum system allowing for contextuality .",
    "this is in contrast to the first instances of state - independent contextuality , the kochen ",
    "specker sets , where the smallest set can not be realized on a three - level system . therefore ,",
    "fifty years after the discovery of state - independent contextuality in quantum theory , we finally have the answer to the question of which is the simplest way to reveal it , i.e. , which is the smallest set of elementary observables exhibiting state - independent contextuality .",
