    "there has been a growing interest in three - dimensional ( 3d ) analogs of graphene called weyl semimetals ( wsms ) where bands disperse linearly in all directions in momentum space around a twofold point degeneracy .",
    "most attention has been devoted to novel response functions in elementary wsms which exhibit a linear dispersion ; however , recently it has been realized that these are just the simplest members of a family of multi - weyl semimetals ( m - wsms ) @xcite which are characterized instead by double ( triple ) weyl - nodes with a linear dispersion along one symmetry direction but quadratic ( cubic ) dispersion along the remaining two directions .",
    "these multi - weyl nodes have a topologically protected charge ( also referred to as chirality ) larger than one , a situation that can be stabilized by point group symmetries @xcite . noting that multilayer graphenes with certain stacking patterns support 2d gapless low energy spectra with high chiralities , these m - wsms can be regarded as the 3d version of multilayer graphenes .",
    "one can expect that their modified energy dispersion and spin- or pseudospin - momentum locking textures will have important consequences for various physical properties due both to an enhanced density of states ( dos ) and the anisotropy in the energy dispersion , distinguishing m - wsms from elementary wsms . in this paper , we demonstrate that this emerges already at the level of dc conductivity in the strong scattering limit described by semiclassical boltzmann transport theory .",
    "the transport properties of conventional linear wsms have recently been explored theoretically by several authors @xcite and there have also been theoretical works on the stability of charge - neutral double - weyl nodes @xcite in the presence of gaussian disorder . however , as we show below , the density- and temperature - dependences of the dc conductivity for m - wsms require an understanding of the effect of anisotropy in the nonlinear dispersion on the scattering .",
    "we develop this theory and find that it predicts characteristic power - law dependences of the conductivity on density and temperature that depend on the topological charge of the weyl node and distinguish m - wsms from their linear counterparts .",
