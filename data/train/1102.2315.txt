    "we remind of the basic principles of cellular automata . in section  [ scenario ] , after reminding of the algorithm to construct a discrete line devised by the first author , see  @xcite , we explain the guidelines which allow us to implement this algorithm into cellular automata in the plane . in section  [ rules ] , we explain how to transform the scenario of section  [ scenario ] into rules which are exhaustively given in the appendix . also , in section  [ rules ] we give a sketchy account of the computer programme devised to construct the rules and to check their correctness . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we briefly mention how to go on in the line open by the paper .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall some results of @xcite and @xcite that we shall need . a * discrete line*@xcite , named @xmath0 , is the set of integer points @xmath1 verifying the inequalities @xmath2 where @xmath3 are integers .",
    "@xmath4 with @xmath5 and gcd(@xmath6,@xmath7)@xmath8 is the slope of the discrete line , @xmath9 is named lower bound and @xmath10 arithmetical thickness . among the discrete lines we shall distinguish , according to their topology @xcite  :    * the * naive lines * which are 8-connected and for which the thickness @xmath10 verifies @xmath11 , * the * @xmath12-connected lines * for which the thickness @xmath10 verifies @xmath13 , * the discrete lines said * standard * where @xmath14 et @xmath15 are named the * leaning lines * of the discrete line @xmath0 .",
    "an integer point of these lines is named * a leaning point*. the leaning line located above ( resp . under )",
    "@xmath16 in the first quadrant ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) respects the following equation @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) , it is named * upper leaning line * ( resp . *",
    "lower leaning line * ) of @xmath16 , noted @xmath21 ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 ) .",
    "let @xmath23 be an integer point , the * remainder at the point @xmath24 * as a function of @xmath25 , noted @xmath26 , is defined by : @xmath27 to simplify the writing , we shall suppose hereafter that * the slope coefficients verify @xmath28 * which corresponds to the first octant .",
    "devised by ulam and von neumann in the late forties , see  @xcite , cellular automata were studied from various theoretical point of view and were applied in many different fields as physics , chemistry , biology , economics and psychology .",
    "cellular automata are shared by several scientific communities , mainly physicists , mathematicians and computer scientists .",
    "we shall consider them from the computer science point of view : for us , they are an algorithmic tool to solve problems .",
    "theoretical computer science proved the turing completeness of cellular automata , which means that they are able to simulate the computation of any turing machine or , which is an equivalent formulation , of any partial recursive function see , for instance @xcite .",
    "they are also considered in various abstract settings , see  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , cellular automata have a great power of simulation , see  @xcite .",
    "what theoretical computer science tells us is that cellular automata are more efficient than turing machines .",
    "if the class of traditional cellular automata working in polynomial time capture the same algorithms as the corresponding class of turing machines and no more , things are different if we consider specific problems and this matters for us . as an example , the best algorithms to compute the product of two natural numbers written in binary has a complexity in @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of digits in the binary representation of the biggest factor  @xmath31 in the considered product . with cellular automata , there is a linear algorithm in  @xmath30 , see  @xcite . while the @xmath29 result involves non trivial results on fourier series , the linear algorithm for cellular automata makes use of a very elementary algorithm : the one which is alike what children learn at school for multiplying numbers with several digits .",
    "many interesting aspects of the complexity of cellular automata can be found in  @xcite .",
    "cellular automata consists of a set of * cells * , which is usually called the * space * of the automaton",
    ". the space must be uniform in the sense that each cell has the same number of neighbours and that the shape of the neighbourhood around the cell is the same for all the cells .",
    "each cell is equipped with a copy of the same finite automaton whose alphabet is called the set of * states * of the cellular automaton . the transition table of this automaton defines what we call the * local transition function * of the cellular automaton . to each neighbourhood of a cell , including the sate of the cell itself called the * current state * of the cell , the function associates a state , called the * next state * of the cell .",
    "these names come from the computation defined for cellular automata as follows .",
    "we have a clock defining a discrete time starting from the * initial * time usually called  @xmath32 . at each top of the clock",
    ", each cell changes its current state by taking the new state defined by the local transition function applied to its neighbourhood .",
    "what we have just described is a * deterministic * cellular automaton as for each neighbourhood , the local transition function defines a single new state .",
    "the space of the automaton is important .",
    "traditionally , the most studied cases are the line , identified with  @xmath33 , as an integer can be given to each cell which is called its * coordinate * , and the euclidean plane , identified with  @xmath34 .",
    "the neighbourhood of the cell can be defined in very different ways . for the line",
    ", we shall take what is called the symmetric neighbourhood of radius  1 .",
    "this means that the neighbours of the cell with coordinate  @xmath35 , we shall later say * the cell  @xmath35 * , are the cells  @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 and  @xmath35@xmath38@xmath37 . as mentioned above , the neighbourhood of  @xmath35 thus consists of  @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 , @xmath35 and  @xmath35@xmath38@xmath37 .    in the euclidean plane , there are traditionally two kinds of neighbourhoods .",
    "if the coordinate of a cell is @xmath1 , its von neumann neighbourhood consists of the cells @xmath1 , @xmath39@xmath38@xmath40 , @xmath41@xmath36@xmath42 , @xmath39@xmath36@xmath40 and @xmath41@xmath38@xmath42 .",
    "this neighbourhood is illustrated by the left - hand side picture of figure  [ voisinages ] .",
    "there is another neighbourhood which is also much used , for instance in the _ game of life _ , which is called moore neighbourhood .",
    "together with the previous neighbours , the moore neighbourhood of  @xmath1 also contains the cells @xmath41@xmath36@xmath43@xmath38@xmath40 , @xmath41@xmath36@xmath43@xmath36@xmath40 , @xmath41@xmath38@xmath43@xmath36@xmath40 and @xmath41@xmath38@xmath43@xmath38@xmath40 . in figure",
    "[ voisinages ] , the neighbourhood is illustrated by the right - hand side picture .",
    "traditionally , alternative names are also given to the neighbours of a cell  @xmath1 in its von - neumann neighbourhood : @xmath39@xmath38@xmath40 is the * northern * neighbour , @xmath41@xmath36@xmath42 is the * western * one , @xmath39@xmath36@xmath40 is the * southern * one and @xmath41@xmath38@xmath42 is the * eastern * one .",
    "these names allow us to not mention the coordinates and we shall use them .",
    "we shall also say that the cell  @xmath1 sees @xmath39@xmath38@xmath40 through its * northern side * , @xmath41@xmath36@xmath42 through its * western side * , @xmath39@xmath36@xmath40 through its * southern side * and @xmath41@xmath38@xmath42 through its * eastern side*. note that these notions are the same as those of 4- and 8-connectedness , see section  [ geom ] .",
    "more precisely , 4-connectedness corresponds to von neumann neighbourhood and 8-connectedness corresponds to moore neighbourhood .",
    "we can write the transition function by taking the list of the state of the neighbours , say the cell , north , west , south and east , which means that we counter - clockwise turn around the cell , and to such a sequence in this order , define a state .",
    "such a list of these six states is called a * rule*. accordingly , the local transition function can also be represented as a * table of rules*. we shall adopt this point of view in the rest of the paper .    a last but not least notion have to be introduced :",
    "the notion of * configuration * which is essential in cellular automata .",
    "formally , it is an application of the space into the set of states of the automaton .",
    "if we apply the local transition function , we define a new configuration . going from one configuration to",
    "a new one by applying the rules defines a new function , this time from the set of configurations into itself which is called the * global function * of the cellular automaton .",
    "however , we shall not look at the succession of the configurations in this way , which is the way mathematicians look at them . we shall devise them one by one , which is a very different point of view .",
    "contrarily to what might suggest the formal definition of cellular automata , programming a concrete cellular automata never starts by writing the table of the rules .",
    "programming with cellular automata is a programming through the data .",
    "we have to initially distribute them in an appropriate way and then look at how we can change this initial configuration to the final one which represents the solution of our problem for the instance defined by the initial configuration .",
    "this transformation of the initial configuration into the final one usually involves many steps and except for very small configurations and for short interval of times , we can not see all of them in a single glance .",
    "we have to split this path from the initial configuration to the final one into stages , sometimes into sub - stages and then for these sub - stages , we can imagine the evolution step by step from the starting point of the sub - stage to its conclusion .",
    "we have to see the states of the cellular automaton as colours , and the changes on the configurations as a kind of painting . but",
    "this painting is moving , it can change parts already painted in one colour into another one . and in the painting , some part of it can be interpreted as a * signal * sent from a part of the data to another one in order to trigger some action .",
    "a typical example is the occurrence of a state somewhere in the data , and we can see that , after a certain time , a part of the data completely changed their initial colour to another one .",
    "the writing of the table arrives as almost the last point : when we arrive to these sub - stages where it is possible to see step by step the transformation form a configuration to the next one .",
    "usually , in this step by step transformation , not all cells change their state at the next step but only a few of them : this allows us to isolate the rules we need for our table by looking at the neighbourhood of a cell before it changed and the new state of the state when it changed .",
    "in such an approach , if the problem is not very complex , and for tiny configurations , this can be done by hand .",
    "but when it is the case to check the validity of the rules by applying them to larger configurations , a computer program is absolutely needed .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , as our cellular automaton is deterministic , we have to be sure that the set of rules does not contain contradictory rules .",
    "this means that if two rules give different next states , they must also be different at least in one of the members of the neighbourhood , the cell itself belonging to the neighbourhood .",
    "second , when starting from an initial configuration which correctly implements an instance of our problem , the computation using our table of rules must lead to a correct implementation of the implementation of the solution .",
    "it is important to indicate here that we assume the initial configuration to be a correct one : the cellular automaton is devised for them and it does not check whether the initial configuration is correct or not .    in the next section ,",
    "we give a simplified version of the scenario .",
    "we call it _ naive _ as it clearly separates the various operations which are performed by the automaton .",
    "from our previous section , we know that our present task is to imagine a sequence of configurations , from the very initial one to the final one which , in an informal sense are * key configurations*.    they are illustrated by figures  [ kconfigpos ] and  [ etape0neg ] for the computation of the line .",
    "figure  [ kconfigpos ] illustrates the case when @xmath44 and figure  [ etape0neg ] illustrates the case when @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding situations are in sub - section  [ scenarpos ] and sub - section  [ scenarneg ] respectively .    in each sub - section , we consider a * cycle * of the computation which consists in appending a new pixel to the part of the line which is already drawn by the automaton . accordingly , the whole work of the automaton is a loop in which each turn consists in performing such a cycle . in these sub - section , the first configuration of a * cycle * is called the * starting configuration * of the cycle .",
    "it is characterized by the position of the data with respect to the part of the line already present . in both sub - section ,",
    "the data consists in three segments which we call * rows * , the @xmath46-row , the @xmath47-row and the @xmath48-row .",
    "each row consists of cells in the same state : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and  @xmath48 for the @xmath46- , @xmath47- and  @xmath48-row respectively .",
    "the number of @xmath46 s and @xmath47 s is the value of  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 respectively in the equation .",
    "the number of  @xmath48 s is the the value of the parameter which controls the drawing . at the beginning of the cycle , this value is the result  @xmath49 yielded by the previous cycle . at a certain point of the current cycle , the number of  @xmath48 s will be .",
    "the rest of the cycle will be determined by the comparison of this value with .",
    "at last , there is a cell in the state  @xmath50 which is the first element of a structure used by the computation .",
    "this cell is placed as both the eastern neighbour of the last written  @xmath51 and the northern neighbour of the first element of the @xmath46-row .",
    "the three rows are placed one above another in the following order : first , the @xmath46-row , below the @xmath47-row and below again , the @xmath48-row .",
    "the @xmath47-row is shifted with respect to the @xmath46-row by a number of cells which is the value of  @xmath9 : to the right if @xmath52 , to the left if @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 , the @xmath47-row is aligned with the others . also , the position of the @xmath48-row depends on the sign of  @xmath9 , as well as the number of  @xmath48 s of which it consists .",
    "we shall see that these dispositions of the data induces a different working of the automaton at some point of the cycle .",
    "the starting configuration is given by the first picture of figure  [ kconfigpos ] .",
    "we notice that the @xmath48-row is aligned with the @xmath46-row , but the number of  @xmath48 s in the starting configuration is always at least the value of  @xmath9 .",
    "we also notice the presence of a  @xmath50 to the east of the last  @xmath51 of the line and to the north of the first @xmath46 of the @xmath46-row .",
    "it is the first element of the future @xmath50-column .    in this naive representation ,",
    "the first step of the cycle consists in moving the data by one step to the east . to this purpose",
    ", the automaton creates the @xmath50-column , see the second picture of figure  [ kconfigpos ] , which erases the first cell of the  @xmath46- and the @xmath48-rows and , when @xmath54 , the first cell of the @xmath47-column .",
    "this triggers a process which we shall later describe which pushes the data by one step to the east .",
    "the colours of the rows are changed : @xmath46 to  @xmath55 , @xmath47 to  @xmath56 and @xmath48 to  @xmath57 . in this process",
    ", the last cell of the @xmath47-row , at its new place , is marked as  @xmath58 . in the @xmath46- and @xmath48-rows ,",
    "the new last element is not marked .",
    "the next step consists in computing .",
    "this is obtained by moving a copy of each cell of the @xmath46-row and to append this copy to the eastern end of the @xmath48-row .",
    "this copy is a new  @xmath48 .",
    "we shall later describe precisely how this is performed .",
    "when the computation is completed , the comparison with is given by the position of the last copied  @xmath46 with respect to  @xmath58 .",
    "this last  @xmath48 of the @xmath48-row can see  @xmath56 through its northern side , in which case , or it can see  @xmath58 , in which case or it can see a blank , which means that . in both latter cases , we have to subtract a bloc of @xmath7  @xmath48 s from the @xmath48-row .",
    "this is illustrated by figures  [ etape10 g ] to  [ etape13 g ] .",
    "then , in all situations , we have to transform the configuration into the starting one of the next cycle .",
    "this is illustrated by the last pictures of figures  [ kconfigpos ] and figures  [ etape14 g ] to  [ etape17 g ] .    in the following paragraphs",
    ", we give the outline of each specific operation we defined in the above description .",
    "a few of them are also used in the case when @xmath53 , so that in sub - section  [ scenarneg ] , we shall not repeat them .      as suggested by the second picture of figure  [ kconfigpos ] ,",
    "the first action performed by the automaton is to construct the * @xmath50-column*. as in the case of the @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-rows , it consists of a vertical block of cells in the state after which the column is called .",
    "note that even when the content of the cell is not  @xmath50 we shall still say that it is a cell of the @xmath50-column .",
    "this structure deletes the first cell of the @xmath46- and @xmath48-rows , also of the @xmath47-row when @xmath54 .",
    "this is to materialize a part of the path that has to be followed by the copies of the cells of the @xmath46-row .",
    "each time @xmath50  erases @xmath46 , @xmath47 or  @xmath59 , @xmath48 or  @xmath59 , it triggers the process of shifting the corresponding row by one step to the east .    when the process is completed , we obtain the configuration illustrated by figure  [ etape3 ] .",
    "later , we look how the process goes on each row in a detailed way .",
    "first , consider the case of the  @xmath47-row in which the process is slightly different .",
    "if @xmath50 sees  @xmath59 through its eastern side , then it transforms  @xmath59 into  @xmath60 .",
    "this state goes from one  @xmath59 to the next one until @xmath60  can see  @xmath47 through its western side .",
    "then , @xmath60 transforms the first  @xmath47 into  @xmath61 which afterwards becomes  @xmath60 : it will be again  @xmath59 when turn to the next starting configuration will be in process . now , as one  @xmath47",
    "was removed , it must be created at the other end of the @xmath47-row . to this purpose ,",
    "the  @xmath47 which sees  @xmath61 through its western side becomes  @xmath56 and this state propagates step by step to all the elements of the  @xmath47-row .",
    "when the last  @xmath47 has changed to  @xmath56 , its eastern neighbour  @xmath59 can see  @xmath56 through its western side . as a consequence ,",
    "this  @xmath59 becomes  @xmath58 .",
    "now , the set of  @xmath56 s and  @xmath58 has the same length as the initial @xmath47-row .",
    "now , let us look at the @xmath46- and @xmath48-rows .",
    "the shift by one step to the east is performed in the same way in both cases .",
    "the elements of the @xmath46- and @xmath48-rows are changed to  @xmath55 and to  @xmath62 respectively . but this change is not performed in the same way as with the @xmath47-row .",
    "the reason is that in this case , we do not mark the last element because the row must be uniform after the change .",
    "we proceed as follows , considering the @xmath46-row .",
    "each  @xmath46 is transformed into  @xmath63 , which , at the next time , becomes  @xmath55 .",
    "the propagation is triggered by  @xmath63 : when @xmath46 sees  @xmath63 through its western side , it becomes  @xmath63 .",
    "the process starts with  @xmath50 : when the second  @xmath46 sees @xmath50  through its western side , it becomes  @xmath63 .",
    "the process is stopped by  @xmath59 : when @xmath59 sees  @xmath63 through its western side , it becomes  @xmath63 , which restores the  @xmath46 which was erased by the @xmath50-column .",
    "when the next  @xmath59 sees  @xmath55 through its western side , it remains  @xmath59 , which stops the process .",
    "we can represent these transformations by simple @xmath64-rules as they happen on a line .",
    "the format of the rules is , where @xmath65 is the current state of the cell , @xmath66 is its new state , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the states of the left- right - hand side neighbours respectively . in the case of the @xmath47-row",
    ", we obtain the following rules :    the rules of the first row are called * transformation rules * : the state of the current cell is changed .",
    "these rules perform the transformation",
    ". the rules of the next two rows are called * conservative rules * as the current state is not changed by the application of the rule .    for the @xmath46-row ,",
    "the rules are :    here , we can see that the first two lines consist of transformation rules and that the next two lines consist of conservation rules . for the @xmath69-row ,",
    "we have the same rules as above , replacing @xmath46 , @xmath63 and  @xmath55 by  @xmath48 , @xmath70 and  @xmath62 respectively .    before turning to the next stage of the computation ,",
    "let us remark that these transformations performed on the  @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-rows are performed simultaneously .",
    "however , they do not start at the same time and , also , they do not complete at the same time .",
    "it is not difficult to see that as long as @xmath71 and @xmath44 , when @xmath58  appears , the elements of the @xmath46-row are all @xmath55 and those of the  @xmath48-row are all @xmath62 .",
    "the appearance of  @xmath58 is the end of the shift of the data by one step to the east .",
    "it also triggers the start of the next stage : appending  @xmath6 to  @xmath49 . as indicated at the beginning of section  [ scenario ] .",
    "the addition is obtained as a sequence of incrementations of the @xmath48-row as many times as the length of the  @xmath46-row .",
    "a copy of each element of the  @xmath46 row is transported from this elements to the current end of the @xmath48-row .",
    "we presently describe this process .    when @xmath58 appeared , its northern neighbour changes its state from  @xmath59 to  @xmath72 .",
    "this @xmath72  is a signal sent on the line of the @xmath46-row to the eastmost  @xmath55 in order to start the copying process . as @xmath72 starts its travel step by step to west , @xmath58  changes to  @xmath73 in order to produce a signal  @xmath72 .",
    "this @xmath73  allows the whole @xmath47-row to wait the next step raised by the comparison of @xmath6+@xmath49 with @xmath9+@xmath7 .",
    "when traveling to the @xmath46-row , @xmath72  obeys very simple rules : , , until @xmath55 is met .",
    "figure  [ etape4_6 ] illustrates two important configurations : when @xmath72 and  @xmath73 are first present and then when  @xmath72 reaches the @xmath46-row with the effect on the @xmath46-row .",
    "when @xmath55 is meet by  @xmath72 , it is changed to @xmath74 , see figure  [ etape4_6 ] , and this  @xmath74 crosses the @xmath55 s in the same way as @xmath72 crossed the blanks .",
    "now , the first @xmath74 turns to  @xmath75 , which means that the copy is in process .",
    "this @xmath75 does not affect its western @xmath74 neighbour and is changed to  @xmath76 at the next time .",
    "now , when this @xmath74 turns back to  @xmath55 , this  @xmath55 sees  @xmath76 through its eastern side , which means that @xmath55  has to be copied : it becomes  @xmath74 , see figure  [ etape7 ] .",
    "this new @xmath74 moves again to the west as the previous one . and",
    "so , when it sees  @xmath76 through its eastern side , each  @xmath55 is changed to  @xmath76 in a cycle of three steps : .",
    "when @xmath76  is reached , the cell remains in that state until the next stage and the occurrence of  @xmath76 triggers the same cycle for the western neighbour of the cell .",
    "note that @xmath75 introduces a delay between the copies of the elements .",
    "this delay is needed in order to create new copies of  @xmath55 s . without it ,",
    "@xmath55 s would make travel a single  @xmath74 .",
    "when the traveling  @xmath74 reaches the @xmath50-column , it is transformed into  @xmath77 : the corresponding  @xmath50 of the @xmath50-column becomes  @xmath77 when it sees @xmath74 through its eastern side .",
    "next , @xmath77  goes down in the @xmath50-column in the same way as @xmath74  moved across the block of @xmath55 s .",
    "and so , this @xmath77 arrives as the western neighbour of the first  @xmath62 of the @xmath48-row .",
    "now , @xmath77 moves to the east across the  @xmath62 s until it reaches the @xmath59 s :",
    "when the most western  @xmath59 on the east of the @xmath48-row sees @xmath77 through its western side , it changes to  @xmath62 : the corresponding element of  @xmath46 has been copied .",
    "this process goes on as long as the most western  @xmath76 triggers the transformation of its western neighbour  @xmath55 into  @xmath74 .",
    "when the block of @xmath76  reaches the last  @xmath55 , this  @xmath55 is directly transformed into  @xmath75 in order to signalize the @xmath50-column that it now receives a copy of the last element of the @xmath46-row .",
    "indeed , when the corresponding element of the @xmath50-column sees  @xmath75 through its eastern side , it becomes  @xmath78 , see figure  [ etape8 ] . from this time ,",
    "@xmath78  travels exactly as  @xmath77 , so that after a certain time it arrives at a position where it can sees  @xmath59 through the eastern side . and",
    "now , this @xmath59-cell knows in which situation we are .",
    "we study this point in the next sub - subsection .",
    "consider a copy of  @xmath55 which moves to the west through the remaining @xmath55 s of the @xmath46-row .",
    "the first one which meets the @xmath50-column transforms it into @xmath62 s . in order to keep track of the copy , @xmath50 is first transformed into  @xmath77 which then turns to  @xmath62 .",

    "simply , it goes to the south or to the east .",
    "the next @xmath74 s which meet the @xmath50-column first fall across @xmath62 which is thus transformed into  @xmath77 in order to convey the copy further , this very cell becoming @xmath62 back at the next time",
    ".    when @xmath75 meets the @xmath50-column , @xmath62 is then transformed into  @xmath78 which behaves on the path of @xmath62 s as  @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 arrives as a western neighbour of a  @xmath59 , this means that is materialized and the comparison with can take place .",
    "indeed , when  @xmath59 sees  @xmath78 through its western side , the state of its northern neighbour indicates him whether , or . in the first case , the northern neighbour is  @xmath56 , in the second case it is  @xmath73 and , in the third one , it is  @xmath59",
    ". then the blank cell becomes @xmath79 , @xmath80 or  @xmath48 respectively .",
    "figures  [ etape9 ] illustrates the three cases .",
    "we successively consider in each case what is the transformation from this situation to the next starting configuration .",
    "first , we consider the case when as , in this case , it is not needed to subtract  @xmath7 from the result of the computation of .      and so in this case , the new data is correct .",
    "we have simply to erase the marks in order to get true @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-rows .",
    "the first idea would be that @xmath79  dispatches the transformation of  @xmath56 back to  @xmath47 and the of  @xmath76 to  @xmath46 by _ contamination_. and then the signal sent from  @xmath79 would reach the bottom of the former @xmath50-column , a signal would go up in order to place the new  @xmath51 at the right place and a new cycle could start . but this propagation process could be long if @xmath7  is very big , so that a new cycle could start before the complete restoration of all  @xmath46 s and @xmath47 s . in order to avoid such a situation , @xmath79  triggers a signal to the right which will circumscribe the configuration by looking at the end of the @xmath47-row , then go back to the @xmath46-row and inspect it from the just above row , so that the switch to the next cycle will be obtained when the initial @xmath76  of the @xmath46-row sees the signal coming from this circumscribing motion through its northern side .    in full details , @xmath79 propagates to the left , transforming each  @xmath62 into  @xmath79 .",
    "it also propagates to the right , transforming each blank into  @xmath82 until @xmath73  is seen through the northern side .",
    "when this happens , the blank cell becomes  @xmath83 .",

    "note that when @xmath47  was transformed into  @xmath56 and  @xmath59 to  @xmath60 , their possible southern neighbours were  @xmath48 and  @xmath59 .",
    "but this transformation of  @xmath56 back to  @xmath47 also transforms  @xmath82 back to the blank and  @xmath79 back to  @xmath48 : it is enough that the considered @xmath82- or @xmath48-cell sees  @xmath47 through its northern side . at the same time",
    ", @xmath47  also triggers the transformation of  @xmath76 into  @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath76 sees  @xmath47 through its southern side and  @xmath76 through its western side , it becomes  @xmath46 .",

    "indeed , when the blank cell which is the southern neighbours of  @xmath73 sees  @xmath82 through its western side , it becomes  @xmath83 which is the signal of the termination of the computation for this cycle .",
    "now the automaton enters the last stage of the cycle : it removes all marks .",
    "we have seen how the turn to a starting configuration is triggered in the @xmath47- , @xmath48- and  @xmath46-rows . as the length of these rows may be very different",
    ", it is important to create a synchronization point so that when the new cycle starts there is no part of the data in the letters of another stage : this would ruin the computation .",
    "the synchronization is obtained by a signal which will be issued from  @xmath73 which circumscribe the data and by the first  @xmath46 of the @xmath46-row : this latter cell which is in  @xmath76 at the moment we consider remains in this state as long as it does not see the signal as  @xmath84 through its northern side .",

    "we can see that  @xmath84 is on a line which is just above the @xmath46-row .",

    "but the next time , we have the first  @xmath50 of the new @xmath50-column triggered by the new configuration and  @xmath87 vanishes , turning to  @xmath59 , as it sees  @xmath51 through its northern side .",

    "when @xmath6@xmath38@xmath88+@xmath7 , the automaton works in the same way in the case when @xmath6@xmath38@xmath89+@xmath7 as well as in the case when @xmath6@xmath38@xmath90+@xmath7 .",
    "the starting is different as different cells are involved in the detection of the situation .",
    "we know that in this case , the blank which sees  @xmath78 for the first time through its western side becomes  @xmath48 .",

    "now , as @xmath47 sees  @xmath80 , @xmath48 or  @xmath70 when it is to the right - hand side of the leftmost  @xmath47 , these @xmath47 s are stable .",
    "when the southern neighbour of the rightmost  @xmath60 can see  @xmath80 through its eastern side , it becomes  @xmath96 .",

    "first , the copying of the @xmath46-row is triggered later : @xmath58 can not issue  @xmath72 on the line of the @xmath46-row , so that it issues it on the @xmath47-row . the signal  @xmath72 moves on this line to the east , as long as it sees  @xmath46 through its northern side .",
    "when its blank eastern neighbour sees also a blank through its northern neighbour , it becomes  @xmath72 and , at the next time , this northern neighbour also becomes  @xmath72 leaving a mark  @xmath125 on the line of the @xmath47-row . now , as @xmath72  is now on the @xmath46-row and as it sees the eastmost element of the @xmath46-row , the standard scenario can take place .    during the second and the third stage",
    ", @xmath124 allows to perform the comparison of  @xmath6+@xmath49 with  @xmath7 . if , the coloration with @xmath82 will go until @xmath125 is seen , so that what happened before with @xmath93 will happen with  @xmath125 .",
    "if , again the colorations described in the present sub - section can take place with @xmath125 playing the role of  @xmath93 . also , the lifting of the data can be performed by signals  1 and  2 as described previously .",
    "it is not very difficult to adapt the above scenario when @xmath6 and  @xmath7 do not satisfy the condition @xmath126 , with @xmath127 .",
    "first , let us assume that both @xmath6 and  @xmath7 are non - negative integers .",
    "we have just to see what to do when @xmath128 . in this condition",
    ", we are in the other half of the quarter of the plane defined by the condition @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "now , it is not difficult to see that if we exchange @xmath35 and  @xmath131 , a discrete line below the first diagonal line is transformed into a discrete line above the diagonal .",
    "however , it is not enough to perform a reflection in the first diagonal line which means exchanging the role of  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 .",
    "we have to also change the value of  @xmath9 .",
    "we have to remember that in full generality , the equation of a nave discrete line is of the form @xmath132 .",
    "if we exchange @xmath35 and  @xmath131 we get @xmath133 , which means , changing the signs : @xmath134 . in order to get the same form , using that the inequalities apply to integers : @xmath135 . accordingly ,",
    "if we exchange the role of  @xmath35 and  @xmath131 , we have also to replace @xmath9 by @xmath136 .",
    "this means that we apply the reflection in the first diagonal to the data too and that we take into account the change for  @xmath9 . and",
    "so , the data are placed in columns along the @xmath131-axis and the construction of the line is still performed by advancing northwards or eastwards as previously , but the meaning is opposite : we go upwards when @xmath137 and we go to the east in the other cases .",
    "note that the data are now to west of the line instead of being to their eastern side .    from this",
    ", it is easy to perform the construction in the other quarters .",
    "as the linear form occurring in the inequation is always @xmath138 , the sign of the coefficients defines the quarter of the plane where the line has to be constructed .",
    "next , in the appropriate quarter , the comparison between @xmath139 and  @xmath140 defines which is the place of the line with respect to the bisector of the angle defined by the quarter .",
    "more details about this implementation will be given in section  [ rules ] .",
    "now we have all the information needed for the construction of the rules .",
    "remember that the form of the rules is defined by the diagram illustrated by the left - hand side picture of figure  [ voisinages ] .",
    "we shall represent the rules of the automaton in the following format :    where @xmath65  is the current state of the cell , @xmath141 , @xmath142 the states of the cells and  @xmath66 the new state of the cell .",
    "remember that this numbering of the neighbours is given to the cells in increasing numbers while counter - clockwise turning around the cell , 1  being the number of the northern neighbour .",
    "accordingly , the correspondence can be given by the following diagram :      in order to define the rules , we start from the configurations indicated in section  [ scenario ] .",
    "our first observation is that we have two kinds of rules : the * conservative * ones and the * active * ones .",
    "a conservative rule is a rule in which the new state of the cell is the same as the current one .",
    "an active rule is the opposite : the new state is different from the current one .",
    "this remark is important : the active rules are derived from the propagation of the various signals described in the scenario and the conservative ones are needed for keeping a part of the configuration unchanged as long as it is needed .",
    "another point which we have to take into account is that the scenario involves situations which induces a lot of rules due to the discrete nature of the cellular automaton .",
    "it is not possible to describe here all the rules induced by these particular cases .",
    "in fact , the particular cases can be described by a few parameters .",
    "we have four parameters which determine the initial configuration : @xmath6,@xmath7 , @xmath49 and  @xmath9 .",
    "what we shall call the * general case * and for which we shall see the rules in this section , are the initial configurations in which @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath49 , @xmath9 , as well as , , , , and are large . in practice , this means that the particular cases are defined by the configurations when at least one of these parameters are less than  4 . when the other parameters are at least  4 , the rules are the same for all cases defined by a fixed value of the considered parameter .",
    "as will be clear from the figures of section  [ scenario ] , the rules needed for the particular cases introduce shortcuts leading from one phase of the cycle to the next one .",
    "an example is given by the figures of section  [ scenario ] where , for instance , @xmath143 , a particular case .",
    "as an example , the situation concerning the @xmath60- or @xmath117-areas at the beginning of the area and the situation concerning the end of the area address consecutive steps in the computation : any rule regarding a cell of the area implies a neighbouring cell which does not belong to the area . and",
    "so , there are specific rules accordingly .",
    "now , during the construction of the rules , as our automaton is deterministic , we have to always check the following condition : if two rules @xmath144 and @xmath145 satisfy @xmath146 when @xmath147 , then @xmath148 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied for all pairs of rules , we say that the rules are * compatible*. if the condition is not satisfied by a pair of rules @xmath149 and  @xmath150 , we say that @xmath149 and  @xmath150 are * incompatible * or that @xmath151 is in * contradiction * with @xmath152 , where @xmath153 .",
    "according to the scenario , we first derive the rules for moving the data by one state to the right .",
    "we start with the conservative rules , as most of the configuration remains unchanged during the first steps of the computation .    remember that the rule for the blank , namely is a conservative rule .",
    "we have another group of conservative rules linked to the state  @xmath51 : once it is written , it is never replaced by another state .",
    "we say that @xmath51  is a * non - erasing * state .",
    "for such a state we write a * meta - rule * which allows to gather several rules under the same pattern : .",
    "we can distinguish several groups of conservative rules : the blank cells which are a neighbour of the data . here too , we can devise meta - rules for two groups of blank cells : those which are to the west of the configuration and those which are to its south . indeed , from the scenario , assuming @xmath154 , we know that the configuration moves to the east or to the north , never in the other directions .",
    "the corresponding meta - rules are : , and . however , the other neighbours of the data are also unchanged , except the cell which sees  @xmath51 through its western side .",
    "accordingly , we also have the following meta - rules : , when @xmath155 and when @xmath156 .",
    "now , due to the relative positions of the @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-rows and the position of the @xmath46-row with respect to  @xmath51 , we have other conservative - rules .",
    "we have and , as the neighbours of the discrete line are unchanged , except the already mentioned situation . besides almost blank neighbours of the data , the cells of the data",
    "are also applied conservative rules , as long as the signals of the computation did not reach them .",
    "consequently , we have the following conservative rules with  @xmath46- , @xmath47- and  @xmath48-cells : as @xmath122 when @xmath44 .",
    "note that when @xmath157 , we have , an example of a conservative rule in a particular case .",
    "if we look at the scenario , many motions are linear : a few symbols are moving on a row or a column , always in the same direction as long as this motion is needed during the stage of the cycle in which it occurs .",
    "for such a motion , remember what we did in sub - subsection  [ shift ] , were we have written the corresponding @xmath64-rules . as an example , consider a motion on a row . then",
    ", if the motion goes to the east , for instance , we can write . as an example , consider @xmath77 moving on a row of  @xmath62 s .",
    "we have two motion @xmath64-rules : , and the conservative @xmath64-rule : which says that the @xmath62  which sees @xmath77  going away remains  @xmath62 .",
    "these rules are written and . from the initial configuration , we know that @xmath158  is always  @xmath59 .",
    "now , @xmath159 , which is the state seen by the cell through its northern side , may take a priori a lot of values : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath47 , @xmath56 , @xmath58 or @xmath73 . in fact , if we carefully the scenario , when @xmath77  crosses a row of  @xmath62 s , the @xmath46  is progressively transformed in a row of  @xmath76 s and all  @xmath47 s of the @xmath47-row are transformed into  @xmath56 and there is an additional  @xmath73 at the eastern end of the @xmath47-row .",
    "accordingly , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are possible and only them .",
    "another situation is the * coloration * of an interval on a row or a column .",
    "this coloration consists in replacing one colour by another , step by step , from one end of the interval to the other . as an example , take the coloration of the @xmath47 s of the @xmath47-row into  @xmath56 s .",
    "once the coloring started , it works on the basis of two @xmath64-rules : and , contamination and persistence respectively .",
    "the full rules are and respectively .",
    "now , later in the cycle , we have the opposite transformation , with the @xmath64-rules and . here , the contamination rule is in contradiction with the persistence rule of the previous case .",
    "now , the full rules are and respectively . accordingly , if the couple @xmath159 , @xmath158 used in one direction is different from the couple @xmath159 , @xmath158 used in the opposite direction , then the rules are compatible .",
    "we shall intensively use this principle .      with the help of the above guidelines",
    ", we turn to the description of the active rules needed by the execution of the scenario we described in section  [ scenario ] .",
    "this means that we assume that @xmath164 .",
    "we also consider the case when @xmath53 but , in this latter case , the rules which we indicate here do not cover the case when .",
    "in most cases , the rules implied for an action are active .",
    "we mention conservative rules when they are needed for the understanding of a coloration process .",
    "we shall not mention the conservative rules generated by a passive part of the configuration during a given stage .      when @xmath119 , the first active rule is given by , which opens the starting configuration .",
    "now , the presence of  @xmath50 as an eastern neighbour of the anchor triggers the construction of the @xmath50-column which first replaces the first element of the @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-rows by  @xmath50 . in the case when @xmath119 , @xmath50 replaces the first elements of the row .",
    "if the @xmath50-column erases the single  @xmath48 , then @xmath48  is replaces by  @xmath115 for one step and then @xmath50 replaces  @xmath115 .",
    "this happens when @xmath113 and @xmath165 or when @xmath114 and @xmath54 .",
    "the construction of the @xmath50-column induces the following rules : , , when @xmath113 , and .",
    "the already mentioned case when @xmath49+@xmath166 entails the rule .",
    "now , @xmath50  also triggers the marking of the @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-rows . in sub - subsection",
    "[ shift ] , we mentioned the @xmath64-rules used in this case . applying the principles of sub - subsection  [ genactive ] , we get the following active rules :    the first line shows the general rule which has two basic variants : @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the second line indicates the rules at the ends of the interval of transformation .",
    "there the two variants for @xmath158 when @xmath169 and there is a single case when @xmath170 , the end of the @xmath46-row .",
    "now , we have the transformations of the basic @xmath64-rule and its variants with and for the ends of the interval .    in sub - subsection  [ shift ]",
    ", we also mentioned conservative @xmath64-rules associated with the transformation of the @xmath46-row .",
    "we leave as an exercise for the reader to develop these @xmath64-rules into rules for our automaton .",
    "similarly , we leave the writing of the rules needed for the @xmath48-row as their @xmath64-analogs are obtained from the @xmath64-rules for the @xmath46-row by changing  @xmath46 to  @xmath48 , keeping the same additional digits .    as mentioned in section  [ scenario ]",
    ", the construction of the @xmath46- and the @xmath47-rows do not follow the same lines .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath47-row , the last element is identified as the last one , which is not the case , neither for the @xmath46-row nor for the @xmath48-one .",
    "now , this makes things easier as pure coloration rules are involved , those which we indicated in sub - subsection  [ genactive ] .",
    "as known from section  [ scenario ] , adding  @xmath6 to  @xmath49 consists in copying one by one the elements of the @xmath46-row in a parallel way .",
    "we know that this process starts when the signal  @xmath72 emitted by the eastmost element of the  @xmath47-row when it is in the state  @xmath58 reaches the eastmost  @xmath55 of the @xmath46-row .",
    "this @xmath55 becomes  @xmath74 , whence the rule .",
    "each cell @xmath55 of the @xmath46-row evolves according to the cycle : .",
    "when the cell reaches the state  @xmath76 , it remains in this state until an appropriate signal appears .",
    "the cell remains in the state  @xmath55 until its eastern neighbour becomes  @xmath76 : at this moment , the above cycle starts . in the period when the cell  @xmath55 remains in this state , it simply passes each copy  @xmath74 of an already @xmath46 changed to  @xmath76 according to the mechanism which we indicated in sub - subsection  [ genactive ] . in @xmath64-rules ,",
    "this can be written as :    the first line corresponds to the transportation of  @xmath74 to the west across the @xmath55 s .",
    "the second line describes the cycle for  @xmath55 .",
    "the first rule of the second line shows that the cycle is triggered when  @xmath76 is the eastern neighbour of the cell containing  @xmath55 , and the other rules describe the whole cycle . of course , additional rules , essentially conservative ones are needed and we leave them to the reader as an exercise . to facilitate it , we indicate how the @xmath64-rules become rules of the automaton :    the transportation of the copy of a @xmath46-element in the @xmath50-column follows similar principles .",
    "this time , the copy travels as  @xmath77 and the @xmath64-rules are this time of the form as the northern and western neighbours are primarily concerned : giving rise to the rules : the rules for the ends of the @xmath50-column are : where the first line deals with the corner of the trajectory of the copy on the level of the @xmath46-row ; the second line deals with the other corner on the level of the @xmath47-row .",
    "we have seen that the transformation of the @xmath48-row is analogous to that of the @xmath46-row and we know that the transportation of  @xmath77 along the @xmath62 s of the @xmath48-row has be seen as an example in sub - subsection  [ genactive ] .",
    "the travel of  @xmath78 which represents the copy of the last @xmath46-element is similar to that of  @xmath77 : it is enough to replace  @xmath77 by  @xmath78 in the corresponding rules .",
    "now , we arrive to the rules corresponding to the comparison of @xmath6+@xmath49 with @xmath9+@xmath7 , illustrated by figure  [ etape9 ] .",
    "these instructions are : with , from the left to the right : the case when @xmath6+@xmath171+@xmath7 , @xmath6+@xmath172+@xmath7 and @xmath6+@xmath173+@xmath7 respectively .      from the scenario , we know that in this case , there are two parallel coloration processes on the level of the @xmath48-row : one to the left , transforming all @xmath62 s to  @xmath79 and one to the right , transforming all blanks to  @xmath82 . for the coloration with @xmath79 , the rules are of the form and , with @xmath161 or @xmath160 .",
    "for the coloration with  @xmath82 the rules are : , and .",
    "now , we are interested by two phenomena : what are the rules when the @xmath79-coloration reaches the @xmath50-column and what are the rules when @xmath82 arrives to the column of the  @xmath56 which is the western neighbour of  @xmath73 .    when the @xmath79-coloration arrives to the @xmath50-column , the rule places @xmath87 at the bottom of the column and this state waits there until a true @xmath48 appears through the eastern side .",
    "so that we have time to see what are the rules at the other end .    in this case , we know that the end of the @xmath82-coloration is achieved when the blank which is the southern neighbour of  @xmath73 can see  @xmath82 through its western side .",
    "this is detected by the rule : .",
    "this @xmath83-signal triggers a sequence of transformations along this column given by the following rules : the rules of the first line indicate that @xmath73 triggers  @xmath86 in the column and on the upper row which itself triggers  @xmath84 in the column and on the upper row , which means that @xmath84 is on the level of the last  @xmath51 written by the automaton .",
    "the second line tells us that @xmath85 leaves  @xmath47 on its place when it vanishes and that @xmath86 leaves a blank .",
    "now , we may wonder why the rule on  @xmath73 has @xmath174 and not @xmath175 ?",
    "in fact , when the @xmath56  which sees  @xmath73 through its eastern side sees  @xmath82 through its southern side , it also knows that at the next step @xmath73  will see  @xmath83 through its southern side . and",
    "so , it may start the process of the back coloration of the @xmath47-row to  @xmath47 .",
    "this is why the instruction has @xmath174 .",
    "this coloration of  @xmath56 s back to  @xmath47 is possible as the @xmath56 seeing  @xmath47 through its eastern side sees  @xmath82 , and later  @xmath79 through its southern side . and",
    "the  @xmath47 which can see  @xmath56 through its western side can see the same states through its southern side .",
    "these contexts are different from what was seen by  @xmath47 and by  @xmath56 in the reverse process : the  @xmath47 and  @xmath56 which could see each other had both  @xmath48 as the southern neighbour .",
    "this is why the corresponding rules are compatible .",
    "this remark explains us why @xmath174 in the rule changing @xmath85 to  @xmath47 .",
    "now , the occurrence of  @xmath83 triggers the back coloration of the level of the @xmath48-row to its initial configuration : the @xmath82 s are transformed to blanks and the  @xmath79 s are replaced by  @xmath48 s .",
    "we leave the writing of the corresponding rules to the reader as an exercise .",
    "we have just to notice that the front of the transformation to the initial look on the @xmath48-row is by one column late with respect to the front of the transformation back to @xmath47 s on the @xmath47-row .",
    "accordingly , the front on the @xmath47-row reaches the @xmath50-column one step before the front on the @xmath48-row . on the level of the @xmath47-row we have the rule so that when the front on the @xmath48-row reaches the @xmath176-column , we have the rule which erases the @xmath87  which stands on the @xmath48-row .",
    "we also know that the front of transformation back to  @xmath47 on the @xmath47-row triggers the transformation of  @xmath76 back to  @xmath46 on the @xmath46-row .",
    "this is also possible because of the advance of the @xmath47-transformation by one step on this new one . so that in the corresponding rules , both for  @xmath46 and  @xmath76 we have  @xmath47 as the southern neighbour and not  @xmath56 or we have @xmath59  as the southern neighbour and not  @xmath60 : the rules are and .",
    "now , we can see that the front on the @xmath46-row arrives to the @xmath50-column one step after the arrival of the front on the @xmath47-row and so , at the same time when the front on the @xmath48-row arrives to the @xmath50-column .",
    "this means that @xmath87 is present in the @xmath50-column , on the level of the @xmath47-row .",
    "we have the rule so that at the newt time , we have again two consecutive @xmath87 in the @xmath50-column and so , the lowest one disappears : and if @xmath54 .",

    "then , the second part of the process can take place and @xmath93 becomes  @xmath99 , rule .",
    "then , @xmath99  turns to  @xmath47 and , at the same time , its northern neighbour turns from  @xmath59 to  @xmath100 , rules and . at the next step ,",
    "@xmath100  becomes  @xmath59 , but the northern neighbour of  @xmath100 changes from  @xmath59 to  @xmath37 , rule and .",
    "we know that this  1 triggers the process of lifting the data by one step upwards . before describing the corresponding rules ,",
    "we look at what happens at the other end of the @xmath48-row .",
    "first , we note that here , the front of transformation on the @xmath48-row is in advance by one step with respect to the front on the @xmath47-row .",
    "indeed , this front is materialized by the pattern @xmath182 .",
    "now , the transformation of  @xmath56 to  @xmath47 on the @xmath47-row is triggered by the occurrence of  @xmath105 , rule .",
    "note that at this moment , @xmath80 is the southern neighbour of this  @xmath56 .",
    "next , the rules for the coloration back to  @xmath47 are similar to those which we have seen in sub - subsection  [ smallerstep ] . however , for these rules @xmath158 is different : it is always  @xmath80 for the southern neighbour of the  @xmath56 changing to  @xmath47 and it is  @xmath70 for the just restored  @xmath47 .",
    "but for this  @xmath47 , its northern neighbour is  @xmath76 as the coloration back to  @xmath46 on the @xmath46-row is triggered by the front on the @xmath47-row : accordingly , the front on the @xmath46-row is delayed by one step with respect to that on the @xmath47-row .",
    "this allows to have rules which are compatible with those of the opposite coloration on the @xmath47-row at the beginning of the cycle .    and",
    "so , @xmath95 is moving to the west .",
    "now , we have two different situations , depending on whether @xmath119 or @xmath53 .    in the first case ,",
    "when @xmath62 sees  @xmath60 through its northern side and  @xmath80 through its eastern one , then it becomes  @xmath96 .",
    "this @xmath96 moves to the west and it allows the transformation of  @xmath60 to  @xmath59 , see section  [ scenario ] , using basically the rule until it sees  @xmath50 through its western side . then @xmath50  is replaced by  @xmath87 , rule and at the next step , @xmath96  is replaced by  @xmath48 : .",
    "the reason of the last rule is that , as explained in section  [ scenario ] , when @xmath96  occurs , it starts a coloration process to the east which replaces  @xmath70 by  @xmath48 and cancels  @xmath80 . just after the occurrence of  @xmath96",
    ", a second one occurs by the application of the rules on @xmath95 .",
    "the rules are : when @xmath87  occurs , it moves upwards in the @xmath50-column , leaving  @xmath59 on its place , until it sees  @xmath76 through its eastern side : it remains there until the penultimate step of the cycle .",
    "the rules are : and .",
    "when @xmath53 , the leftmost @xmath80  can continuously see  @xmath56 through its northern side while moving to the west until it sees  @xmath50 through its western side .",
    "so , the process is a bit simpler in this case .",
    "when the leftmost  @xmath80 can see  @xmath50 through its western side , it is replaced by  @xmath70 and this  @xmath50 is replaced by  @xmath87 , rules and .",
    "now , the pattern @xmath183 changes to  @xmath184 , rules and . from the previous rules ,",
    "we know that the @xmath50 of the @xmath47-row changes to  @xmath87 when it sees  @xmath47 through its eastern side which happens at the next step , due to the delay by one step of the front on the @xmath48-row with respect to that of  @xmath80 on the @xmath48-row .",
    "as the southern neighbour of this new  @xmath87 is  @xmath59 , it disappears , rule , and its northern neighbour turns from  @xmath50 to  @xmath87 , due to the presence of  @xmath117 through the northern side and of  @xmath87 through the southern one , rule .",
    "this last  @xmath87 remains there until the penultimate step of the cycle .    during this time , the signal  1 travels to the west by one step at each time , rule and .",
    "a rule on  1 satisfies the pattern : this means that  1 copies what it sees through its southern side .",
    "now , this southern neighbour is replaced by  2 , pattern .",
    "examples of such rules are given by and , when @xmath53 also by , as the eastern neighbour is already a lifted symbol .",
    "we know that  2 behaves like  1 , lifting its southern neighbour but replacing it by  2 .",
    "this southern neighbour also becomes  2 unless both its own northern and southern neighbours are  @xmath59 . in rules",
    ", this means that we have .",
    "this process also restores  @xmath59 in the place of  @xmath117 when @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , in this case , the restoration is performed by  1 thanks to the rule .",
    "remember that when @xmath52 , the transformation from @xmath76 to  @xmath46 and from  @xmath60 to  @xmath59 is triggered by the transformation from  @xmath56 to  @xmath47 .",
    "the shifting of the data by one step upwards is conducted by signal  1 .",
    "when 1  can see  @xmath50 through its western side , we have two configurations , depending on the sign of  @xmath9 , which are slightly different .",
    "we have that @xmath50 becomes  @xmath102 , rule , and that 1  lifts up a symbol .",
    "when @xmath119 , 1  lifts up  @xmath76 , changing it to  @xmath46 , rule and @xmath76  is replaced by  2 , rule . when @xmath53 , 1  lifts up  @xmath117 ,",
    "changing it to  @xmath59 , rule . at the next step , there are no more differences for the active instructions : @xmath102  is replaced by  @xmath103 , rule and @xmath87  is replaced by  @xmath59 , rule .",
    "the rules involving  2 have still been in action and , when @xmath103  is present , the last remaining  2 is the northern neighbour of the leftmost  @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , at the next step , 2  will be replaced by  @xmath48 using a pattern we have already seen and no  2 will be produced , rule . at the same time , @xmath103  vanishes , rule , and its northern neighbour turns from  @xmath59 to  @xmath51 , writing the new pixel , rule .",
    "the obtained configuration is the last one of the cycle .",
    "as indicated in section  [ scenario ] , we can not give all the details about the particular cases defined by the conditions on small parameters or small differences between the parameters .",
    "these situations are not difficult and they are left to the reader . as already mentioned , they can be attached to the general cases by rules which constitute shortcuts to a situation already controlled by a general rule",
    ".    however , we have to go back to what we have depicted , as we had an important constraint : @xmath122 .",
    "we have dealt with the case @xmath164 , but the scenario fully applies when @xmath185 .",
    "if we start with @xmath113 , as we append  @xmath7 , the comparison with  @xmath7 will always detect a situation where  @xmath7 has to be subtracted from the computed remainder and so we again have @xmath113 .",
    "now , the new pixel is written at the correct position .",
    "as this situation is repeated at each cycle , the pixels are written on the first diagonal as required , so that there is nothing to do .",
    "note , that in the execution of the automaton , we never use the fact that  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 should be coprime numbers , so that we can remove this assumption .    here , we shall look at the way we can extend the automaton to the cases when we do not have @xmath186 .",
    "first , we shall successively consider the situations when @xmath187 , when @xmath188 and then the situation when @xmath6 and  @xmath7 have arbitrary signs .      in this case",
    ", the line is a row of @xmath51 s .",
    "if we apply algorithm  [ algo1 ] , we remark that assuming a value of  @xmath49 , appending @xmath6 to  @xmath49 does not change the result .",
    "iterating the cycle will thus lead us to a row of  @xmath51 s which is the correct solution .",
    "the implementation of this solution with our automaton raises a problem .",
    "indeed , if @xmath6=0 , there is no  @xmath46 on the @xmath46-row .",
    "this looks like a situation when @xmath53 .",
    "however , it may happen that @xmath189 .",
    "the difference occurs on the @xmath47-row where there is at least one  @xmath47 , as we rule out the case when @xmath190 which can not define a line . if @xmath52 , the @xmath50-column meets a  @xmath59 on the level of the @xmath47-row",
    "otherwise , it necessarily meets a  @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , if during its construction the @xmath50-column meets a blank both on the  @xmath46- and the @xmath47-rows , necessarily @xmath187 .",
    "if it meets a blank on the @xmath46-row and a  @xmath47 on the @xmath47-row , then the automaton has to explore the length of the blank area .",
    "this length was tacitly assumed to be less than  @xmath47 in section  [ scenario ] and also in the previous sub - sections of section  [ rules ] .",
    "now , we may keep this assumption : indeed , @xmath9  is a parameter which , together with  @xmath7 defines the point of the @xmath131-axis where the line cuts the axis . by possibly changing the position of the @xmath35-axis , we may assume that @xmath191 .",
    "accordingly , if the automaton sees that the whole interval of  @xmath47 s on the @xmath47-row is covered by blanks , this means that @xmath187 . in this case",
    "there is nothing to append to the remainder and it is enough to write the new pixel .",
    "again , the iteration of such a cycle will produce the expected row of  @xmath51 s .",
    "the situation when @xmath192 and @xmath187 is easily detected within the existing scenario .",
    "however , the situation when @xmath52 and @xmath187 entails that the starting configuration remains unchanged , due to the rule used for the stability of the bottom of the @xmath50-row when @xmath113 and @xmath119 . as @xmath187 is a very special configuration , fixed at the initialization , we may require that , in this case , @xmath189 .",
    "in sub - section  [ allcases ] , we have defined the general frame for the study of the case when @xmath188 .",
    "we have seen that the naive discrete line which is the reflection of the naive discrete satisfies the equation .",
    "we have noticed that this leads to exchange the @xmath35- and the @xmath131-axes .    in figure",
    "[ symetrie ] , we can see the change we have to perform . at first glance",
    ", it should be enough to operate the similar change on the rules .",
    "the automaton would then act as required .",
    "in fact , it happens that a rule and a rule satisfy @xmath193 for @xmath142 and @xmath194 but that @xmath195 .",
    "in such a case , introducing the new rule would lead to a contradiction .",
    "the solution is to check , for each rule , whether the reflected one exists .",
    "if it has the required sate , it is ok , if not , then the reflected one can not be taken .",
    "however , the contradiction can be avoided if a state is changed in the reflected rule .",
    "the computer program allows us to detect the rules whose reflection would produce a contradiction , if appended to the set of rules .",
    "a look at these rules allows us to find which state to replace in the reflected rule by a new state . with this process , it is not very difficult to enlarge the table of rules with the ones which are needed for the case when @xmath188 .    and",
    "so , we may now consider that our automaton works for any @xmath196 , @xmath6+@xmath127 .      from this , it is not difficult to extend our automaton in order to construct any naive discrete line with the condition @xmath197 .    we know how to initialize the automaton , depending on the signs of  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 and on the comparison between @xmath139 and  @xmath140",
    "in this section , we give an estimate of the number of steps performed by the automaton in a cycle .",
    "we know that the initial data satisfy the following constraint :    let @xmath198 be the number of cells between the @xmath50-column and the eastmost non - blank cell during the computation of a cycle .",
    "from the two possible displays discussed in section  [ scenario ] and from section  [ remaining ] , we get that @xmath199 as the above constraints are satisfied .    also from these sections",
    ", we know that we can split a cycle into the following stages : the first step is performed by a run from the @xmath50-column to the easmost non - blank cell : this requires at most @xmath198 + 4 steps , as the @xmath50-column has 4  elements . for appending the elements of  @xmath46",
    ", we have to consider the travel of  @xmath72 on the blank until it meets the @xmath46-row .",
    "then , a copy is delivered every second step and each element , traveling at speed  1 , advancing by one cell per time , we have at most @xmath198+@xmath7 + 4 steps . to estimate the time needed by the possible subtraction",
    ", we have to decompose this stage into sub - stages .",
    "first , when the eastmost  @xmath48 is written , a coloration goes back until it can see  @xmath73 on the @xmath47-row : this takes at most @xmath7 steps .",
    "then , a @xmath80  appears which moves at speed  1 towards the @xmath50-row . at the same , time",
    ", a signal goes to the east , at speed  1 too , to the eastmost  @xmath48 , which takes at most  @xmath7 steps and at the end of this time there is a moving zone of @xmath200 s .",
    "the second sub - stage is the shrinking of the @xmath200 zone which takes at most a number of steps equal to its length : at most @xmath201 .",
    "but the westmost @xmath80 can then be at  @xmath7 steps at most from the @xmath50-column and so , this second sub - stage requires at most @xmath202 steps .",
    "now , the restoration occurs during the subtraction and it is estimated by the time needed for signal 1 to go from the cell it appeared to the @xmath50-column : at most @xmath202 . as we have seen , an additional delay of 3  steps is required by signal  2 .",
    "accordingly , summing up all these times we have 10@xmath7 + 11 steps .",
    "now , thanks to the study of sections  [ scenario ] and  [ rules ] , the correctness of the rules boils down to checking that there are no contradictory rules . as the number of rules is over than 1,000 rules , this was performed by a computer program written for this purpose .",
    "in fact , the computer program helped us to devise the rules at the different stages of the cycle .",
    "also , checking a finite number of suitable executions was enough to prove the correctness of the program : indeed , as the working of the algorithm is linear in the size of the data , and as the structure of a naive discrete line is periodic , if the execution works for a particular choice of general parameters , it works for all of them .",
    "it is only needed to check the particular cases when at least one parameter is small , which we did for many cases .",
    "we have seen that 300 steps of execution are enough to get convinced of the correctness of the computation performed by the automaton .",
    "accordingly we have proved :    there is a deterministic cellular automaton which simulates the construction of a naive discrete line given by the equation where we may assume to satisfy , @xmath203 .",
    "moreover , there is such an automaton whose working is linear in the length of the data and of the segment of the discrete line to be constructed .",
    "this latter point raises an interesting question : in a concrete implementation , we could define the halting of the computation in a different way .",
    "in fact , for concrete applications , we necessarily have a cellular automaton whose space is finite . the simplest way is to define the space of the cellular automaton as a rectangle of @xmath204+@xmath205+@xmath206 cells . putting @xmath207 as the coordinates of the lower left - hand side corner , or the south - west one according to the terminology of the paper , the coordinates of the north - east corner would be @xmath204+@xmath208+@xmath40 .",
    "of course , the cells have to know when they are at the boundary of the area .",
    "the simplest way is to signalize the limit by a * frame * surrounding the cells devoted to the computation of the line .",
    "the cells of the frame are an additional state , say # , and the coordinates of these cells are of the form @xmath209 and @xmath210+@xmath40 with @xmath211 + 1 for the horizontal limits of the rectangle and @xmath212 with @xmath213+@xmath42 where @xmath214 for the vertical limits .",
    "there is no rule for the cells of the frame which , by definition are in a fixed state .",
    "for the blank cells which are in contact of the frame , we have the following conservative rules : for the northern limit , for the western limit , for the southern limit and for the eastern limit .    during the execution ,",
    "a problem may arise when we have to lift the data by one step upward . in this case",
    ", state  1 should occur when instead of the blank , it sees # through its northern neighbour .",
    "this means that the rules , and have to be replaced by the rules , and respectively . also , when 1  just vanished , the rule is replaced by the rule .",
    "we know that @xmath102 disappears and should trigger the transformation of its northern neighbour by  @xmath51 .",
    "now , @xmath102 may be changed to  @xmath103 , which means that the rule is replaced by , but the northern neighbour , which is now # , can not be replaced by  @xmath51 .",
    "we have also to replace the rule by the rule . at this point ,",
    "all rules which can be applied are conservative rules , so that the computation stops as , after the application of these rules , we obtain the same configuration . indeed ,",
    "if two consecutive configurations are identical , this situation is repeated endlessly and so , we can imagine a mechanism which detects the situation , which is always possible , in principle , if we start from a finite configuration .",
    "we think that there are many possible continuations for this work . as an example , what was done for the line could be viewed for curves , or for planes in the @xmath215-grids or sub - spaces of @xmath216-dimensional grids .",
    "now , for lines in the square grid , there are also possible continuations .",
    "we can indicate the following ones .",
    "first , we could try to improve the scenario described in section  [ scenario ] .",
    "it has to be completed for a few particular cases , especially for the rules covering them .",
    "however , from a complexity point of view , there might be some improvement . in the section",
    ", we indicated the scenario as a naive version where the different stages are well delimited .",
    "we could lower a bit the complexity established in section  [ complexity ] .",
    "indeed , the starting of the copy of the elements of the @xmath46-row could be already placed when the first element of the @xmath46-row is erased by the @xmath50-column in construction . also later",
    ", other stages could be more intricate by starting as early as possible .",
    "but is this worth the work ?",
    "we could lower the upper bound of @xmath217 down to to no more than @xmath218 and perhaps somehow below .",
    "but the price to pay would be a more difficult proof . here ,",
    "as the stages are well delimited , the starting configuration of a cycle is well characterized , so that it is enough to check that the execution of a cycle leads from one starting configuration to the next one .",
    "the overlapping of the stages would make it difficult to define the notion of a cycle itself .",
    "it would be more difficult to check that there is no interaction between a finishing cycle and the already started next one , as such an interaction might ruin the computation .",
    "for what are complexity issues , a more promising improvement could be given by the following remark .",
    "our simulation is based on a representation of the integers in",
    "_ unary_. what could be done for a _ binary _ representation ?",
    "basically , the same scenario could be performed , with this important difference that adding here would not be simply appending and that subtracting would not be simply dragging back .",
    "however , an appropriate disposal of the data could make it possible to perform addition and subtraction : each element represents a bit in a certain position .",
    "appropriate markings can be managed to do the job as expected .",
    "now , the number of states would most probably be more important and this would also increase the number of rules . however , the automaton would still be linear in time with respect to the size of the data but its programming in cellular automata would be more difficult than for the automaton of this paper .",
    "now , this time , the complexity would be much lower .",
    "another continuation would be to devise a cellular automaton which would recognize whether a given pattern in the @xmath215-grid is or not a discrete line .",
    "we hope that this paper opens a new promising avenue giving a new connection between discrete geometry and cellular automata .",
    "the second author wishes to express his deep thanks to loria and cnrs who made the possibility of this collaboration highly effective ."
