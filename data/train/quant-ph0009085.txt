    "the longitudinal oscillation frequency @xmath16 hz appears to be a reasonable lower limit because time scales longer than a second gives rise to experimental difficulties due to seismic and acoustic noise .",
    "thus , the maximum value which is currently feasible for @xmath7 is @xmath17 and would limit the number of atoms inside the trap to about one million .",
    "the main experimental difficulty , however , is to fill the @xmath18 states of the micro trap with a substantial number of atoms . starting from an optically cooled sample of atoms with a phase space density of typically @xmath17 @xcite a phase space compression of six orders of magnitude",
    "is required to completely fill up the wave guide .",
    "such compression is possible with state of the art techniques of evaporative cooling @xcite .",

    "vii we calculate the expansion of the particle density distribution when the trap is suddenly switched off .",
    "an appendix summarizes mathematical formulae used in our calculations .",
    "we consider a gas of spinless non  interacting fermions in one spatial dimension and trapped in a harmonic potential    @xmath36    the hamiltonian in second quantization and for the grand canonical ensemble is    @xmath37    with one  particle energies @xmath38 .",
    "the chemical potential is denoted @xmath39 .",
    "the fermion creation operators @xmath40 and destruction operators @xmath41 obey the fermionic algebra @xmath42 .",
    "this ensures that each ( non - degenerate ) energy level @xmath43 with ( real ) single particle wave function    @xmath44    ( normalized according to @xmath45 ) is at most singly occupied .",
    "the intrinsic length scale of the system is the oscillator length @xmath46 where @xmath25 is defined by ( [ 0.1 ] ) .",

    "a standard textbook exercise then gives    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    is the thermal occupation number of the single particle state @xmath56 .",
    "the present paper deals with the case @xmath57 when a number of analytical results are available .",
    "the important simplification results from the fact that for @xmath58 the first @xmath0 levels are completely filled while all others are empty , i.e. ,    @xmath59    and @xmath39 becomes the fermi energy @xmath29 :    @xmath60    the density @xmath61 which we henceforth denote @xmath62 takes on the form    @xmath63    the zero temperature case is depicted in fig . 1 .    equation ( [ 1.13 ] ) is the main object of the present study . under the condition @xmath64 it correctly describes the density of non  interacting fermions in a harmonic trap .",

    "this is in contrast to an infinite fermi gas ( or one with periodic boundary conditions ) where the density is homogeneous .",
    "the ripples appear here as a finite size effect . in the center of the trap",
    "they will be identified below as friedel oscillations @xcite .",
    "in this section we summarize the relevant scales of the one  dimensional fermion gas in the harmonic trap .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the basic quantities @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 .",
    "one of them is clearly the fermi energy @xmath29 according to ( [ 1.12 ] ) . at the fermi energy",
    "the filled fermi sea has a spatial extension @xmath65 according to @xmath66 or    @xmath67    a quantity frequently appearing later .",
    "the positions @xmath68 are classical turning points for a fermion with energy @xmath29 .",
    "the length @xmath69 is the largest length of the problem followed by @xmath70 which is associated with the zero point energy",
    ".    equation ( [ a.10 ] ) of the appendix shows that a wave function @xmath71 behaves as a standing wave with wave vector @xmath72 in the middle of the trap provided @xmath73 . at the fermi energy",
    "the wave number becomes @xmath74 .",
    "together with ( [ 1.12 ] ) this leads to @xmath75 as suggested in @xcite for the three  dimensional anisotropic case .",
    "the fermi wave number @xmath76 is the shortest length scale of the problem and the fermi energy the largest energy .",
    "what is the relation between @xmath3 and the particle density ? in a one  dimensional fermion gas of spatial extension @xmath65 with periodic or open ( infinite potential well ) boundary conditions the relation is in both cases    @xmath77    in the present inhomogeneous situation @xmath3 increases as @xmath78 because the width @xmath79 of the trap also increases as @xmath78 .",
    "however , we can discuss peak density @xmath80 and average density @xmath81 ( or even higher moments of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the peak density is clearly found near @xmath82 .",
    "using the asymptotic result ( [ a.11 ] )    @xmath83    gives    @xmath84    the sign @xmath85 denotes here and further on an asymptotic correspondence for @xmath86 .",
    "note that this asymptotic limit does not imply the semi ",
    "classical approximation .    from ( [ 2.9 ] )",
    "it is seen that the usual relation ( [ 2.5 ] ) between @xmath3 and the one  dimensional particle density refers here to its peak value near the center .",
    "it is more difficult to discuss the average density @xmath81 since an averaging length is needed .",
    "equations ( [ 2.7 ] ) or ( [ 2.8 ] ) only give the obvious sum rule    @xmath87    we thus resort to the semi  classical approximation where the local density is given @xcite by    @xmath88    which is zero outside @xmath89 .",
    "the corresponding average density clearly is @xmath90 and is only slightly smaller than the peak density .",
    "the sum rule for @xmath91 gives @xmath92 , i.e. , half a fermion is missing under the curve @xmath91 .",
    "this is due to the neglect of fermion density leaking out of the classical region @xmath89 by tunneling .",
    "one might conclude that the number of fermions in the oscillations is about one half .",
    "this is not correct for large fermion number @xmath0 when the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath93 near the boundaries becomes significant due to increasing oscillations in the exact density as detailed in the next section .",
    "finally , using formula ( [ a.11 ] ) immediately allows the identification of the ripples in @xmath94 near the center with the well known friedel oscillations @xcite of wave number @xmath2 around an impurity in the degenerate fermi sea . in a naive interpretation",
    "these oscillations result from the superposition of incoming and reflected parts of the uppermost wave function which both have a wave number @xmath3 near the center of the trap .",
    "a more subtle interpretation refers to the inherent instability of the degenerate free fermi gas towards static longitudinal perturbations of wave number @xmath95 .",
    "a well studied example are free electrons ( cf .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while in three dimensions only a logarithmic singularity in the derivative with respect to @xmath96 appears in the susceptibility it becomes a logarithmic singularity in one dimension due to perfect nesting .",
    "this causes charge and spin density instabilities when backscattering interactions are present . in bounded luttinger liquids ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the interactions modify the divergence of the density oscillation near the boundary .",
    "but even without interactions breaking of translational invariance by inhomogeneities like impurities and boundaries trigger density oscillations of wave vector @xmath97 . in one dimension this effect",
    "is well known for non  interacting fermions with open boundary conditions . while in one dimension",
    "the effect is most pronounced it is , nevertheless , possible to identify the oscillations in the isotropic density calculated in @xcite as three  dimensional friedel oscillations .    since the one ",
    "dimensional friedel - oscillations contain only about one atom it will be difficult to detect this effect experimentally .",
    "however , it is conceivable to use an array of shorter micro traps each filled with a reduced number of atoms .",
    "the oscillations within each trap then add up and lead to a total effect that is enhanced by the number of traps .",
    "using micro fabrication techniques it should be possible to combine 100 traps on one substrate leading to a signal that may become within reach of advanced imaging techniques .",
    "friedel oscillations though difficult to observe are a fundamental property of the degenerate fermi gas which eludes the semi  classical approximation .",
    "with the help of ( [ a.4 ] ) the summation in ( [ 1.13 ] ) can be performed for any @xmath50 and @xmath0 with the result :    @xmath98    using the recurrence relations for the wave functions @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "appendix ) this expression can be brought into another useful form    @xmath99    this shows that the density distribution must be a polynomial of order @xmath100 in @xmath101 times the exponential @xmath102 since the density is an even function of @xmath50 .",

    "this is shown in fig . 2 for @xmath113 .",
    "the area between @xmath114 and @xmath115 contains precisely one fermion . in this way",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is optimally implemented .",
    "the above considerations also show that about half a fermion is contained in the ripples of the density distribution .",
    "the density at the maxima is given by    @xmath116    and at the minima it is :    @xmath117    due to the knot theorems @xcite the topological features inherent in the above statements carry over to arbitrary concave potentials . thus counting the number of maxima of the density distribution gives the number of fermions in any concave trap .",
