    "this was first demonstrated in spectroscopy experiments with phase qubits coupled to a lumped - circuit resonator @xcite and more recently in time - domain experiments involving the active emission and absorption of a photon in a transmission line coupling two phase qubits@xcite and through dispersive interactions of charge qubits with an intermediate cavity .",
    "@xcite    while we focus on phase qubits coupled by capacitors in the following , our results can be readily extended to these and other superconducting qubit designs .",
    "previous theoretical studies of one - dimensional quantum state transfer have been performed for both charge @xcite and flux @xcite qubits .",
    "more generally , the fundamental importance of novel quantum transport in superconducting qubit arrays was discussed by levitov _",
    "et al._@xcite central to our multi - dimensional circuit design is the use of long - range couplings and multi - layered devices ",
    "these properties have also been used in other recent designs for superconducting quantum computers .",
    "@xcite    in the following sections , we first describe the design of a phase qubit hypercube .",
    "then , by using the tunability of the phase qubit , we show how high fidelity state transfer can be performed between any two of the @xmath0 qubits in the @xmath1-dimensional hypercube network .",
    "furthermore , we show how to correct errors due to the higher - order coupling terms naturally present in the multi - qubit hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we analyze the effects of decoherence and disordered couplings to show that this approach can be demonstrated using existing technology .",
    "we consider a network of capacitively - coupled phase qubits @xcite ( see fig .  [ circuit ] ) , modeled as current - biased josephson junctions described by the following hamiltonian @xmath2 where junction @xmath3 has a critical current @xmath4 and adjustable bias current @xmath5 , and where @xmath6 is the flux quantum .",
    "the dynamical variables are the phase differences of each junction @xmath7 and their corresponding conjugate momenta @xmath8 , the latter coupled by ( the inverse of ) the capacitance matrix @xmath9 . in the ideal case ( to be relaxed in sec .",

    ". a hypercube will result if we connect vertices whose labels differ only by one bit .",
    "thus , the corner labeled @xmath28 will have @xmath1 neighbors , each with a single @xmath27 in its label ( e.g. @xmath29 ) .",
    "the elements @xmath30 of the adjacency matrix are unity whenever the labels correspond to connected vertices , and are zero otherwise .    using",

    "the hypercube topology can be accomplished with only pairwise crossing of the coupling wires .",
    "these wires can be fabricated in a cross - over configuration , shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , in which insulating material separates the two superconducting layers . by making this separation large enough ( @xmath41 m ) , cross - coupling between these wires",
    "can be reduced significantly .",
    "multi - layered superconducting circuits with six metallic layers have been reported .",
    "@xcite    in addition , coupling a large number of qubits will require wires spanning multiple qubits . a long wire will have a non - negligible inductance @xmath42 , leading to a resonant mode with frequency @xmath43 which could perturb the state transfer dynamics . however , long - range coupling of this sort has already been tested @xcite with lengths approaching one millimeter , large compared to the typical dimensions of the qubits ( @xmath44 m ) .",
    "the corresponding inductance in this circuit was found to be @xmath45 nh , which combined with a coupling capacitance @xmath46 ff leads to @xmath47 ghz , much higher than the qubit frequency ( @xmath48 ghz ) .",
    "this is significantly off - resonant and thus the resonant mode will remain in its ground state  although the nature of the coupling will be slightly modified .",
    "@xcite    finally , the actual fabrication of a hypercube circuit appears quite complex .",
    "however , the number of wires in this design is actually quite modest .",
    "the hypercube circuit can couple any two qubits in the same amount of time  this is shown in the next section .",
    "this property is shared by a completely connected set of @xmath49 qubits . however , since a @xmath1-dimensional hypercube has @xmath50 edges , @xcite the hypercube requires significantly less connections .",
    "specifically , the completely connected circuit would require @xmath51 wires ( @xmath52 for @xmath53 ) , while the hypercube would require only @xmath54 wires ( @xmath55 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "we conclude that this is a promising theoretical design that can be implemented , at least for modest @xmath1 , using existing technology .",

    "note that this expression shows that for this type of state transfer we need only work with the effective hamiltonian for this subspace , with the matrix form @xmath75 .",

    "note that for phase qubits , the initial state can be prepared and the final state can be verified using the state tomography techniques demonstrated by steffen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite    by dynamically switching the qubit frequencies into and out of resonance , this state transfer protocol can be extended to _ any pair _ of qubits in the hypercube .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath84 only if @xmath85 is an edge of the subcube of the hypercube with @xmath58 and @xmath61 as corners , and @xmath86 otherwise .",
    "that is , this network can be `` programmed '' by tuning the qubit frequencies into resonance for subcubes of the hypercube .",
    "as there are many disjoint subcubes , @xcite this network allows for the transfer of quantum information in parallel , all with similar transfer times .",
    "this dynamical switching can be achieved by low - frequency control of the phase qubit s control circuit , @xcite and was demonstrated in a recent experiment .",
    "@xcite    this network can be used for many tasks in quantum information processing . by coupling each node of this network to an additional set of `` memory '' qubits",
    ", this scheme allows for the parallel execution of multi - qubit gates between a large ( @xmath0 ) number of qubits . a more promising application ( from the perspective of fault tolerance ) builds on this idea to quickly distribute entanglement between multiple nodes that can then be purified locally , and refreshed during computation .",
    "this entanglement can then be used for logic gates , error detection , or other teleportation - based tasks .",
    "there are many limitations to the success of this scheme , which we now analyze .",
    "the qubit and rotating wave approximations have been used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ qbit1 ] ) .",
    "the qubit approximation fails if higher energy states are excited .",
    "this could occur , for example , during parallel operation of subcubes , but can be avoided by sufficiently large detuning . @xcite the rotating wave approximation should hold for sufficiently small couplings @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite    a more significant error is due to the higher - order terms in the coupling matrix @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ qbit2 ] ) .",
    "state transfer succeeds by engineering the spectrum of the first - excited - state subspace .",
    "this spectrum is determined by the adjacency matrix , which for the hypercube can be mapped to an angular momentum operator on the vertex space : @xmath88.@xcite using this mapping for the phase - qubit hypercube , the effective hamiltonian @xmath89 can be written as @xmath90 where we have ignored an overall constant ( @xmath91 ) . while @xmath92 has a linear spectrum ( leading to perfect transfer ) , the higher - order terms add quadratic ( and higher ) terms to the spectrum .",
    "these terms lead to an intrinsic dephasing of the time evolution .",
    "however , by varying the frequencies of each qubit , one can correct for these terms by the following scheme .",
    "first , label the rows of the @xmath1-dimensional hypercube from @xmath26 to @xmath1 ( these labels are equal to the hamming distance of the binary label of each node from @xmath93 ) . then , setting the frequencies for each qubit in row @xmath94 to @xmath95 leads to the new effective hamiltonian : @xmath96 one can then show , using perturbation theory in the eigenstates of @xmath92 , that the choice @xmath97 corrects for the contribution of @xmath98 to the spectrum .",
    "thus , by simply engineering a quadratic frequency shift across the network , this lowest order error can be eliminated [ see fig .",
    "1(d ) ] .",
    "we now demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme by calculating how the error @xmath99 scales as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ errorx ] . here",
    "@xmath101 is the fidelity calculated using the effective hamiltonian , simulating state transfer with the initial state specified by @xmath102 and @xmath103 . without any correction , the error scales as @xmath104 , shown by the dashed lines , while the correction described above yields residual errors proportional to @xmath105 and @xmath106 , shown by the solid lines .",
    "these curves are found by calculating the effect of the quadratic and cubic terms of the eigenvalue spectrum on the state transfer fidelity .",
    "these terms arise from both the higher - order couplings omitted above ( e.g. @xmath107 ) and the imposed variation of the qubit frequencies .",
    "as these qubit frequencies can also be controlled dynamically , these higher - order errors could be eliminated by using well - known quantum control techniques .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , this single correction reduces the error over two orders of magnitude , and becomes tolerable even for large ( @xmath108 ) hypercube networks .",
    "any experimental demonstration will also encounter the effects of decoherence and disorder .",

    "a perturbative solution can be found , but requires a careful examination of the eigenstates of @xmath73 and how they are mixed by the decoherence terms . after a long calculation @xcite",

    "[ rhofig ] , this solution for @xmath132 compares well to direct numerical simulations of the master equation ( [ dmat1 ] ) as well as to more detailed simulations ( not shown ) of a master equation for the phase qubit system involving a large number of non - qubit states ( e.g. hundreds of states for @xmath36 ) .    using these results",
    "we can calculate the state transfer fidelity @xmath133 , at the transfer time @xmath134 with @xmath135 : @xmath136 an important feature of this solution is that , so long as the frequency @xmath137 and the coupling @xmath100 remain fixed , the state transfer fidelity has a lower bound that is independent of the size of the network . to show this , we follow bose @xcite and consider the fidelity @xmath138 averaged over the bloch sphere ( the worst case can be bounded similarly ) : @xmath139 using the fact that @xmath140 , we find that @xmath141 and thus @xmath142 since the transfer time @xmath143 is independent of @xmath1 , so is this bound on the fidelity .",
    "furthermore , this simple formula shows that the fidelity can be greater than the classical limit @xcite of @xmath144 for existing experimental devices .",
    "for example , with @xmath145 ghz , @xmath146 , and the decoherence times @xmath147 ns and @xmath148 ns , @xcite we find @xmath149 ns and thus @xmath150 .    note that this bound on the fidelity is specific to our decoherence model .",
    "if the qubit decoherence times depend on the size of the circuit , this model should be improved .",
    "physically , the complexity of the wiring design ( the cross - overs and interconnects ) could introduce significant loss using traditional dielectrics .",
    "@xcite however , advanced fabrication using vacuum gaps should remove this potential decoherence source .",
    "@xcite note also that for fixed capacitors ( instead of fixed @xmath137 and @xmath100 ) , there is in fact a weak dependence of the transfer time on @xmath1 : @xmath151^{3/2}$ ] .",
    "however , for the experimental parameters given above , this dependence can be neglected for @xmath152 .",
    "no experimental circuit will have identical qubits  there will always be some variation .",
    "this variation in parameters is equivalent to disorder , and in this context we might expect a blocking of transport due to anderson localization .",
    "@xcite that is , by mapping propagation through the hypercube to an effective spin , the information travels along a one - dimensional path ( row by row ) .",
    "@xcite this was studied in previous work , @xcite in which static disorder was introduced into the one - dimensional effective hamiltonian for perfect state transfer .",
    "there it was found that disordered couplings play a much larger role than disordered qubit frequencies , with results in agreement with localization theory .",
    "note that we have already allowed the qubit frequencies to be under experimental control , so here we only consider disordered couplings .    to simulate the effects of static disorder on multi - dimensional state transfer , we use use the full subspace hamiltonian and introduce disorder into the coupling matrix by @xmath153 (",
    "the higher - order terms are neglected here ) where each @xmath154 is a random variable uniformly distributed over the range @xmath155 . the transfer fidelity ( with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) is then calculated and averaged over this uniform distribution . the averaged fidelity is shown in fig . [ errory ] .",
    "these results are consistent with @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "this implies that , for very large @xmath1 , transport is exponentially suppressed due to localization .",
    "however , even a hypercube of modest dimension , where localization effects are small , can accomodate a large ( @xmath0 ) number of qubits .",
    "for example , while state - of - the - art fabrication can achieve variation of order 1% or less , fig .",
    "[ errory ] shows that even for 10% variation in a network with @xmath160 one still has @xmath161 .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed that the hypercube network can be used to route quantum information between superconducting qubits . using tunable phase qubits ,",
    "this network can be programmed to achieve high - fidelity quantum state transfer between any two nodes and allows for rapid distribution of entanglement in a superconducting quantum computer .",
