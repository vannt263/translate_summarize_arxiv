    "the problem of extrinsic ( domain wall ) contributions has been addressed by many authors , both experimentally and theoretically . in the prevailing number of cases , only extrinsic",
    "permittivity has been studied . for piezoelectric ceramics ,",
    "arlt et al.@xcite were the first to address the problem of wall contributions to all involved properties : permittivity @xmath3 , elastic compliances @xmath4 and piezoelectric coefficients @xmath5 . in this and related papers ,",
    "the existence of the restoring force is assumed and its origin was not specified .",
    "later , arlt and pertsev@xcite offered a more involved approach : when domain wall in a ceramic grain is shifted , uncompensated bound charge appears on the grain boundary , producing electric field .",
    "simultaneously , if the involved domains are ferroelastic , a wall shift results in mechanical stress in surrounding grains .",
    "thus the shift is accompanied by the increase of both electric and elastic energies , leading to restoring forces .",
    "results of these theories have been successfully related to experimental data on all three mentioned contributions : @xmath0 , @xmath2  and @xmath1.@xcite    while there exist a number of such data for ceramic materials@xcite , information for single crystals is rather scarce . understandably , for nonferroelastic ferroelectrics such as tgs only data on @xmath0are available;@xcite on the other hand for crystals which are both ferroelectric and ferroelastic with more than two domain states , dense domain systems are rather chaotical , difficult to approach theoretically . in the present paper",
    ", we have in mind ferroelectric and ferroelastic crystals with only two domain states . in particular , crystals belonging to the @xmath6family",
    "belong to this category and have been intensively studied .",
    "nakamura et al.@xcite determined @xmath7  for @xmath6 , @xmath8  and @xmath9 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "nakamura and kuramoto@xcite proved the existence of both @xmath7and @xmath10  while @xmath11  was measured for @xmath12@xcite .",
    "for the same material , all quantities @xmath7 , @xmath11  and @xmath10  have been measured by tula et al.@xcite it was found that all these contributions are mutually proportional when measured as a function of temperature , in the temperature interval between @xmath13  and @xmath14 - 35 k. several other ferroics for which our approach may be applicable will be mentioned at the end of this paper .    in single crystals , the origin of the restoring force is usually connected to domain wall pinning on crystal lattice defects . in our recent papers@xcite",
    "we introduced the model of a passive surface layer to calculate the restoring force for domain walls and the resulting extrinsic permittivity and piezoelectric coefficient .",
    "in fact , the influence of a surface layer on the properties of a ferroelectric sample was discussed repeatedly several decades ago . in particular , in connection with the sidewise motion of domain walls in @xmath15 , thickness dependence of the coercive field , asymmetry of a hysteresis loop or the problem of energies of critical nuclei , theoretically impossibly high .    in the present paper ,",
    "we return to this approach .",
    "however , in contrast to previous calculations , we offer a more involved model .",
    "the shift of a domain wall induced by the application of electric field or elastic stress results in the increase of _ both _ electric and elastic energies . in the following , these",
    "are explicitly calculated which makes it possible to determine all extrinsic coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath10  and @xmath11 . their dependence on the sample properties will be discussed .",
    "-@xmath16 plane [ arta3:fig : xzgeometry],width=321 ]    -@xmath17 plane [ arta3:fig : xygeometry],width=321 ]    we consider a plate - like sample elecroded sample of infinite area with major surfaces perpendicular to the ferroelectric axis @xmath16 .",
    "the material is both ferroelectric and feroelastic ; domains with antiparallel polarisation differ in the sign of spontaneous shear . however , we shall approximate the material in the ferroelectric phase by the equation of state @xmath18 neglecting the intrinsic piezoelectricity . as we shall see",
    ", this does not supress the existence the extrinsic piezoelectricity , which is one of the aims of our calculations . in the preceding equation",
    ", we also neglect nonlinear terms ; for 2nd order phase transitions this limits the validity of our calculations to the temperature region not very close bellow the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "domain walls are assumed to have surface energy density @xmath19 and zero thickness .    for simplicity",
    ", we approximate elastically anisotropic material of the sample by the elastically isotropic one . neglecting again the intrinsic piezoelectricity ,",
    "its mechanical properties are described by equations for stress tensor components @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are lame coefficients of the passive layers and the bulk respectively ; @xmath23 is the strain tensor , @xmath24 is the spontaneous strain tensor of the central ferroelastic part .",
    "we suppose that the only nonzero components of the spontaneous strain tensor are @xmath25 in the @xmath26 resp .",
    "@xmath27 domain , see fig.[arta3:fig : xygeometry ] .",
    "we introduce the asymmetry factor @xmath28 we neglect thermal interactions and suppose that the sample is thermally isolated . to keep the constant voltage @xmath29 on the sample , the electrodes should be connected to external electrical source . in the same way , to keep constant external stress @xmath30 , the sample should be deformed by external mechanical force .",
    "the infinitesimal work of these external sources should be taken into consideration when discussing the variations of the energy of the isolated system sample + sources .",
    "in what follows we consider three contributions to helmholtz free energy , calculated per unit area of the plate - like sample ( in the @xmath31-@xmath17 plane ) :    the energy of domain walls per unit area of the sample @xmath32,\\ ] ] the electric field energy per unit area of the sample @xmath33 where the integration is taken over parallelepiped @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and energy of elastic deformations per unit area of the sample : @xmath37 where the integration is taken over the same region , in the first case for constant external stress @xmath38  in the plane @xmath39 , in the second one for constant displacement @xmath40 in the plane @xmath39 . in both cases , the displacement for @xmath41 is chosen to be zero and the boundaries of the sample in x - y plane are free of stress .    to find the @xmath42  and @xmath43 , we have calculated electric potential and mechanical displacement inside the sample by fourier method .",

    "understandably , the latter mechanism can not be excluded for ferroics of any chemical composition . on the other hand ,",
