    "the study of nuclei far from stability is an increasingly important part of contemporary nuclear physics .",
    "this topic is related to newly created radioactive beams facilities , allowing more experiments on nuclei beyond the stability line .",
    "the new experimental opportunities on nuclei with extreme isospin ratio and weak binding bring new phenomena which inevitably require a universal theoretical description of nuclear properties for all nuclei .",
    "the current approach to the problem is the nuclear density functional theory which implicitly rely on hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory , unique in its ability to span the whole nuclear chart .",
    "the hfb equations can be solved in coordinate space using box boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this approach ( abbreviated hfb / box in this paper ) has been used as a standard tool in the description of spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "its implementation to systems with deformed equilibrium shapes is much more difficult , however .",
    "different approaches have been developed to deal with this problem , such as the two - basis method @xcite , the canonical - basis framework @xcite and basis - spline techniques in coordinate - space calculations developed for axially symmetric nuclei @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are precise , but time - consuming .",
    "configuration - space hfb diagonalization is a useful alternative to coordinate - space calculations whereby the hfb solution is expanded in a complete set of single - particle states . in this context , the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis turned out to be particularly useful . over the years",
    ", many configuration - space hfb codes using the ho basis ( abbreviated hfb / ho ) have been developed , employing either the skyrme or the gogny effective interactions @xcite , or using a relativistic lagrangian @xcite in the context of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory . in the absence of fast coordinate - space methods to obtain deformed hfb solutions , the configuration - space approach has proved to be a very fast and efficient alternative allowing large - scale calculations @xcite .",
    "close to drip lines , however , the continuum states start playing an increasingly important role and it becomes necessary to treat the interplay of both continuum and deformation effects in an appropriate manner .",
    "unfortunately , none of the existing configuration - space hfb techniques manage to incorporate continuum effects .    the goal of the present work is to find an efficient numerical scheme to solve hfb equations for spherical and axially deformed nuclei , which properly takes the continuum effects into account .",
    "we will denote this problem as continuum hfb ( chfb ) .",
    "aiming at treating spherical and deformed nuclei on the same footing , we rely on the configuration - space hfb approach .",
    "the ho basis has important numerical advantages ; for example , the use of the gauss - hermite quadrature allows fast evaluation of matrix elements . on the other hand ,",
    "its gaussian asymptotics prevents from expanding systems with large spatial extension , such as halo nuclear states .",
    "this problem can be successfully fixed by using the transformed ho basis ( tho ) @xcite .",
    "the latter transforms the unphysical gaussian fall - off of ho states into a more physical exponential decay .",
    "neither ho nor tho bases , however , are able to provide proper discretization of the quasiparticle continuum .",
    "this has repercussions already at the hfb level , for which the ho and tho bases can not reproduce simultaneously all asymptotic properties of nuclear densities ( see sec .",
    "[ results_section ] ) .",
    "while this shortcoming is obvious for the ho basis , it also arises for the tho basis because the latter can provide only one type of asymptotic form , i.e.  the one inserted in the scaling function defining the tho wave functions @xcite .",
    "hence , the tho basis fails to reproduce asymptotic properties , as asymptotic behavior is different for respective channels : proton and neutron , normal and pairing densities , different angles for the deformed case .",
    "in fact , differences between calculations using the tho and the coordinate - space bases have been noticed in pairing properties of nuclei ( see sec .",
    "[ results_section ] and ref .",
    "this indicates that tho calculations may not always be fully accurate even in the nuclear region and necessitate careful check of obtained results .",
    "for the aim of carrying out quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) calculations with the hfb quasiparticle representation , the ho and tho bases are very likely to be insufficient as they can not provide accurate quasiparticle wave functions in the continuum region .",
    "obviously , a more practical basis is needed .",
    "the gamow hartree - fock ( ghf ) basis @xcite would be appropriate , as it has been demonstrated that it can provide the correct asymptotic of loosely bound nuclear states .",
    "however , it implies the use of complex symmetric matrices .",
    "moreover , the presence of basis states which increase exponentially in modulus leads to numerical divergences , unless the costly two - basis method is employed @xcite .    as we plan to consider bound hfb ground states only , it is more advantageous numerically to employ hermitian completeness relations , whose radial wave functions are real .",
    "they are either bound , thus integrable , or oscillate with almost constant amplitude , so that we are free from the numerical cancellation problems associated with the gamow states .",
    "it should be stressed that we can generate a gamow quasiparticle basis using the hfb potentials thus obtained .",
    "we can then describe resonant excited states by means of the quasiparticle random phase approximation representing the qrpa matrix elements in terms of the gamow quasiparticle basis .",
    "this serves as an interesting subject for future investigation .",
    "one could expect that the employment of the spherical hartree - fock ( hf ) potential to generate the real continuum hf ( chf ) complete basis would solve the problem .",
    "unfortunately , the chf basis is not numerically stable due to the presence of resonances in the vicinity of the real continuum .",
    "the continuum states lying close to a narrow resonance are rapidly changing , so that a very dense continuum discretization around this resonance is necessary to accurately represent this energy region .",
    "important numerical cancellations would occur as continuum wave functions become very large in amplitude close to narrow resonances .    to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we adopt a technique based on the exactly solvable pschl - teller - ginocchio ( ptg ) potential @xcite .",
    "the spherical hf potential , seemingly the best candidate to generate a rapidly converging basis expansion , but providing numerically costly ghf bases or unstable chf bases , is replaced by a ptg potential fitted to the hf potential if the latter give rise to resonant structure .",
    "it will be shown that the narrow resonant states of the ghf basis will become bound in the ptg basis , so that its scattering states will have no rapid phase shift change , a necessary condition for numerically stable continuum discretization . as a result",
    ", we obtain a very good basis for hfb calculations .",
    "we call this approach hfb / ptg .    to test the feasibility of this new method",
    ", we have performed numerical calculations for spherical ni isotopes near the drip line , @xmath0ni  ",
    "@xmath1ni , for a strongly deformed nucleus @xmath2zr , and two hfb solutions for @xmath3 mg with different , prolate and oblate , deformations .",

    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coordinate of the particle in normal and spin space , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the particle - hole and the particle - particle ( hole - hole ) components of the single - particle hamiltonian , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the upper and the lower components of the single - quasiparticle wave function , and @xmath11 is the chemical potential  @xcite . for simplicity of notation ,",
    "the isospin index @xmath12 is omitted in eq .",
    "( [ chfbeq ] ) , but , of course , we solve the chfb equation for coupled systems of protons and neutrons .",
    "in this section , we outline the calculational scheme and details will be presented in the succeeding sections .    the proposed method to solve the chfb equations , abbreviated hfb / ptg ,",
    "consists of the following steps :    \\(1 ) one starts with spherical or deformed hfb calculations in the ho basis ( hfb / ho ) .",
    "this provides a good approximate solution for the hf potential and the effective mass .",
    "\\(2 ) one considers a hf potential and an effective mass for each @xmath13 subspace , and fits the associated shifted ptg potential to them when the hf potential possesses bound or narrow resonant states in this @xmath13 subspace ( see sec .",
    "[ ptg_fit ] ) .",
    "if no such states appear in the hf @xmath13 spectrum , a set of bessel / coulomb wave functions @xcite is selected for the @xmath13 partial wave basis .",
    "\\(3 ) one diagonalizes the hfb eigenvalue equations in the basis composed of the ptg and bessel / coulomb wave functions .",
    "this step continues until self - consistency is achieved .",
    "the use of the bessel / coulomb wave functions in step ( 2 ) occurs for partial waves of high angular momentum , for which the centrifugal part becomes dominant . as no resonant structure can appear",
    "therein in the real hf continuum , bessel / coulomb wave functions provide a numerically stable set of states for this partial wave . for the generation of coulomb wave functions , one can use the recently published c@xmath14 code @xcite or its fortran alternative @xcite .",
    "a complete set of wave functions is thus formed , which will be used as a basis to expand the hfb quasiparticle wave functions .",
    "the necessary truncation of the basis in step ( 3 ) implies that spurious effects may eventually appear at very large distances , where both the particle density @xmath15 and the pairing density @xmath16 are very small .",
    "consequently , quasiparticle wave functions have to be matched to their exact asymptotics at moderate distances as it is explained further in sec .",
    "[ qp_asymptotic ] .",
    "in addition , special care must be taken to calculate matrix elements due to the presence of non - integrable scattering states ( see appendix  [ me_appendix ] ) .",
    "when the hf mean - field resulting from the hfb / ho calculation in step ( 1 ) is deformed , there are several ways to extract the hf potential for each @xmath13 subspace to be used in step ( 2 ) .",
    "because it is used just as a generator for the complete ptg basis , its choice will have little effect on the final hfb solution , however . in the present calculation",
    ", we therefore adopt a simple procedure ; the particle - hole part of the hfb / ho potential and the hfb / ho effective mass are used in step ( 2 ) after averaging their angular and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting hf potential is spherical and the same for all @xmath13 subspaces .",
    "in such a case , the effect of the spin - orbit splitting is not taken into account in the stage of constructing the ptg basis but it is of course taken into account in step ( 3 ) .",
    "this implies to consider a basis generated by a spherical potential , which might seem inefficient in the case of large deformation , for which deformed bases are more appropriate , as is done with the ho and tho bases .",
    "the deformed nuclei considered in this paper are nevertheless fairly reproduced within this framework ( see sec .  [ results_section ] ) . if necessary",
    ", it is possible to generate a deformed basis by diagonalizing the deformed hf potential within the ptg basis , which can then serve as a particle basis for the hfb problem .",
    "the ptg potential has four parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which have to be determined in each @xmath13 subspace ( see appendix  [ ptg_appendix ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we use the spherical hf potential and effective mass in a given @xmath13 subspace .    the ptg mass parameter @xmath18 is obtained from the requirement that the ptg and the hf effective masses are the same at the origin .",
    "one first adds the centrifugal term @xmath19 to the nuclear plus coulomb potential , @xmath20 , and determines the height @xmath21 of the centrifugal ( plus coulomb ) barrier .",
    "then , one adds @xmath21 to the ptg potential ; the resulting potential may be called the shifted ptg potential .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fitted in such a way that the @xmath24 difference between the shifted ptg potential and the hf potential is minimal .",
    "note that @xmath25 is directly obtained from @xmath22 and @xmath23 values during the fit , as it is determined by way of the property that the ptg potential of parameters @xmath26 and @xmath18 for @xmath27 is equivalent to @xmath28 times the ptg potential of parameters @xmath29 and @xmath18 .",
    "the reason why we use the barrier height @xmath21 in our fitting procedure will become apparent by an illustrative example presented below .    to test the fitting procedure and the quality of the resulting ptg basis we performed ghf calculations in the coordinate space for the spherical nucleus @xmath0ni .",
    "let us examine the quality of single - particle energies and wave functions resulting from the shifted ptg potential by comparing them with the ghf energies and wave functions for bound and resonance states .",
    "figure  [ shifted_pot ] illustrates the ptg fitting procedure and compare the results with the ghf ones taking the neutron @xmath30 level as an example .",
    "it is seen that the energy of the bound @xmath30 state in the original ( unshifted ) ptg potential ( horizontal dotted line ) become positive after being shifted with @xmath21 ( horizontal dashed line ) and its position agrees in a good approximation with the resonance energy obtained by the ghf calculation ( horizontal solid line ) .",
    "this is due to a special feature of the ptg potential , for which the centrifugal potential decreases exponentially and not as @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( see app .",
    "[ ptg_appendix ] ) .",
    "this implies that the centrifugal + shifted ptg potential goes very quickly to the constant value , @xmath21 , for @xmath32 .    in this way",
    ", the ptg treatment replaces the ghf resonance with a weakly bound ptg state whose wave function will be very similar in the nuclear region . approximating resonant states by weakly bound states in our framework",
    "resembles the standard two - potential method described in ref .",
    "thus , one can expect that the fitted ptg potential provides a rapidly converging basis for solving the hfb equations .",
    "in fact , it is not necessary to find the ptg potential that exactly minimize the @xmath24 difference with the hf potential . as the ptg potential is used as a basis generator , slight differences with the exact minimum lead only to slightly different bases states to expand the hfb quasiparticle wave functions , preserving its rapidly converging properties .",
    "thus , one can take rather large steps for the @xmath33 variations and few radii for the @xmath24 evaluation to save computer time , keeping the quality of the basis essentially the same .",
    "single - particle energies and widths for neutrons in @xmath0ni obtained by the ghf calculations are compared with the ptg energies in table  [ ptg_neutron_energies ] .",
    "one can clearly see the following facts .",
    "firstly , the overall agreement between the ghf and the shifted ptg energies is good , which means that the ptg potential is flexible enough to reproduce the main features of the hf potential .",
    "secondly , all narrow ghf resonances are represented as weakly bound ptg states with upward shifted ptg energies .",
    "this is very important because the hfb upper ( lower ) components of quasiparticle states are likely to have large overlaps with unoccupied ( occupied ) weakly bound and narrow resonance states .",
    "we note that the ghf states whose width is larger than 1 mev , as a rule , are not converted to bound ptg states .",
    "this is not important , however , because scattering states do not exhibit rapid changes in the energy region of broad resonances .",
    "the broad resonance region can indeed be well represented in terms of the continuum basis states .",

    "it is obvious that all densities calculated with the tho basis eventually follow the common asymptote dictated by the scaling function , while they are well reproduced with use of the ptg basis .",

    "the prolate and oblate states lead to asymptotic neutron densities which are very close , as seen from the middle and bottom right panels in fig .  [ fig_deformed_dens ] .",
    "we have proposed a new method of the chfb calculation for spherical and axially deformed nuclei , which properly takes the continuum into account .",
    "the method combines configuration - space diagonalization of the hfb hamiltonian in the complete set of analytical ptg and bessel / coulomb wave functions with a matching procedure in the coordinate space which restores the correct asymptotic properties of the hfb wave functions .",
    "the ptg potential is chosen to fit the nuclear hf potential and effective mass .",
    "the resulting ptg wave functions are close to the bound and continuum states of the related hf potential while the resonance states are substituted by the bound ptg states with shifted single - particle energies .",
    "partial waves of high angular momentum are very well represented by bessel / coulomb wave functions .",
    "the main results of the present work are twofold :    first , we have obtained a new scheme ( hfb / ptg ) to solve the chfb equations as a promising tool for large scale calculation ; its performance is comparable , sometimes even better , to that of the hfb / tho code , for example .",
    "it properly takes the nuclear continuum into account and therefore could be used for precise density functional calculations for nuclei close to the drip lines .",
    "this hfb / ptg method can also be used to provide accurate quasiparticle wave functions for microscopic calculations of dynamics beyond the nuclear mean - field approximation , as for example , the qrpa calculations for deformed nuclei .",
    "second , the fact that the hfb / ptg calculation reproduces the results of the coordinate - space hfb calculation with the box boundary condition ( hfb / box ) even for nuclei up to the neutron drip lines is important .",
    "this result indicates the validity of the hfb / box calculation which is widely used , although its validity is sometimes questioned when it is applied to the drip - line phenomena where continuum effects are crucially important @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of resonant structure in the basis is crucial for the success of the hfb / ptg approach .",
    "our test calculations indicate significant disagreement with the hfb / box result if the ptg bound states representing the resonant ghf states are removed from the basis : in their absence , the pairing densities are overestimated in the surface region , while particle densities are slightly underestimated in the inner region .",
    "this means that the resonance states significantly contribute to the total energy through both the particle - hole and particle - particle channels .",
    "their contributions to the pairing correlation energy are evaluated to be about 2 - 3 mev for the case of ni isotopes close to the neutron drip line .",
    "a more complete investigation of the importance of the hfb resonance states could be made by a detailed comparison with the result of the exact gamow - hfb calculation .",
