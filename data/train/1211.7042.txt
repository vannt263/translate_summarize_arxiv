    "the high degree of experimental control in modern quantum dot systems allows detailed manipulation of electrons and their spin in confined states.@xcite a particularly intriguing example was investigated by ono _",
    "et al_.@xcite in a series of experiments .",
    "these revealed that , not only the charge , but also the pauli exclusion principle for spin states can block the electronic transport through a double quantum dot ( dqd ) coupled in series . to observe this phenomenon  dubbed _ _ spin - blockade__@xcite ( sb )  the energy levels of the two dots are tuned asymmetrically , so an electron with a definite spin is trapped in -say- the right dot .",
    "now , only electrons with the opposite spin ( to the trapped one ) can pass through the dqd , since two electrons with equal spins in the right dot is tuned to be energetically forbidden .",
    "therefore , once an electron with the same spin ( as the trapped one ) tunnels into the left dot , then transport through the dqd is blocked .",
    "sb requires non - linear bias and due to the asymmetric energy level tuning of the dots , current is only blocked in one direction leading to the observed current rectification.@xcite    an electron can escape from the states blocking transport by a spin relaxation process , which leads to a small leakage current in the sb regime .",
    "analyzing the leakage current is therefore an excellent tool to obtain information about the spin relaxation processes from a transport experiment.@xcite there are several ways to escape from the blocking states : via co - tunneling processes,@xcite spin - orbit meditated spin relaxation@xcite and/or by hyperfine interaction@xcite ( hfi ) between the electronic spins and the nuclear spins of the host material.@xcite the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the material and the external parameters . for instance , a specific co - tunneling process can become important by tuning the gate - voltages such that the virtual energy exchange in the co - tunneling process becomes low.@xcite    ever since the experiments by ono _ _ et al.__@xcite in vertical gaas dqds , several geometries and materials have been used to further study the leakage current in the sb regime due to different relaxation mechanisms.@xcite for instance , churchill _",
    "et al_.@xcite analyzed experimentally the leakage current in carbon nanotube dqds varying the amount of @xmath5c  the only stable carbon isotope with a non - zero spin .",
    "this amounts to varying the spin relaxation due to hfi from very important ( high @xmath5c concentration ) to not important ( almost no @xmath5c present ) .",
    "this shows how different the leakage current can be with and without nuclear spins.@xcite nowadays , spin - orbit coupling is also thought to play a role in carbon nanotubes.@xcite    sb in silicon dqds has also been studied.@xcite in a recent work , lai _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite eliminated the hfi in silicon dqds by isotopic purification  along the same lines as churchill _ _ et al.__@xcite in this case , co - tunneling processes caused the leakage current in the sb regime ( in good agreement with recent theories@xcite ) , since the spin - orbit coupling is expected to be weak in silicon.@xcite in contrast , spin - orbit interaction is generally believed to be strong in inas .",
    "this enabled pfund _ _ et al.__@xcite to investigate its importance on the leakage current in inas nanowire dqds .",
    "finally , recent studies show bipolar sb triple dots@xcite and valley - spin blockade in carbon nanotube dqds.@xcite    a hf - induced spin relaxation process from a blocking state will flip the electronic and nuclear spin in opposite directions , fig .  [",
    "fig : feedback - illustration](b ) .",
    "the electronic spin relaxation in the sb regime can therefore change the average occupations of the nuclear spin states , since the nuclear spin relaxation time is very long compared to the electronic tunneling timescales.@xcite the repeated electronic spin - flip due to the leakage current can therefore produce a _ dynamical nuclear polarization _ ( dnp ) .",
    "the dnp acts back on the electronic states of the dqd as an effective magnetic field , the so - called overhauser field.@xcite the overhauser field is generally _ inhomogeneous _ and therefore often different in the two dots .",
    "dnp is also studied in optical@xcite and quantum hall@xcite systems .",
    "it is important to emphasize that even though the hf - induced spin - relaxation do flip a nuclear spin , it will not _ always _ change the _ average _ nuclear polarization in the steady state of the sb regime .",
    "for instance , if hfi is the _",
    "only _ spin relaxation mechanism causing the leakage current , then the nuclear spins remain unpolarized.@xcite essentially , this is because tunneling into one of the two blocking states consisting of two spin - up electrons , @xmath6 , or two spin - down electrons , @xmath7 , are equal .",
    "escape from these two states will polarize the nuclei in opposite directions and therefore on average the polarization does not change .",
    "this is so , even though the escape rates from the blocking states might be very different.@xcite in this case of hfi being the _ only _ cause of leakage current , the nuclear spins can be modeled as an effective magnetic field with _",
    "zero _ mean value and non - zero statistical deviation@xcite as has also been used to fit experimental data.@xcite nevertheless , if _ more than one _ spin relaxation mechanism contribute to the leakage current in the sb regime , then the nuclei can indeed obtain a _ non - zero _",
    "dnp.@xcite    the finite dnp leads to experimentally measurable signatures in the leakage current.@xcite perhaps the most fascinating of these signatures is that of a _",
    "leakage current versus external parameters like the magnetic field or a gate - voltage as has been observed.@xcite for instance , pfund _ _ et al.__@xcite found hysteresis due to a competition between hf and spin - orbit induced escape from the blocking states .",
    "the hysteresis signals a _",
    "bistability _ in the dnp : for a certain range of parameters , there exists two stable values of the dnp leading to two values of the current . for other parameters",
    "the nuclear spins might be polarized , but the dnp is single - valued and hence also the current.@xcite    very high polarizations@xcite of about _ half _ of the nuclei have been found experimentally in the sb regime,@xcite and even higher dnps were not excluded .",
    "spin diffusion from the dqd to the environment and dipole - dipole interactions are very weak , but nevertheless expected to reduce the polarizations somewhat.@xcite    other experimental findings like long - lived current oscillations in time@xcite and transient phenomena in the leakage current@xcite have also been attributed to the nuclear spin environment.@xcite furthermore , it has been shown that dnp can build up in dqds by cycles in gate - voltage space  without transport through the dqd.@xcite    the hfi is most effective to lift sb close to the crossing of the electronic energy levels between e.g.  a triplet and the singlet state such that energy is conserved in the spin - flip process.@xcite in order to get close to a level crossings , the local gate voltages on the dots , the inter - dot tunneling or the external magnetic field can be varied experimentally .",
    "the local gate voltages change the energy levels of the individual dots and thereby the so - called _ energy detuning _",
    "( i.e.  the electrostatic energy difference between one electron in each dot and a singlet in the right dot ) .",
    "the barrier between the dots controls the wavefunction overlap and therefore the quantum mechanical _ exchange energy _ between the singlet and triplet states .",
    "moreover , the external magnetic field splits up the triplet levels .    , which compete to create a non - zero dnp in the sb regime .",
    "the cycle of transporting an electron through a blocking triplet state @xmath8 begins and ends with a single electron trapped in the right dot @xmath9 . during a single transport cycle ,",
    "the dnp @xmath10 is changed by a small amount @xmath11 ( depending on the specific transition ) , if the escape from @xmath8 is hf mediated ( upper branch ) .",
    "the dnp acts back on the energy levels @xmath12 via the overhauser fields and , in turn , on both the hf spin - flip rates @xmath13 and the tunneling rates @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , the weak inelastic escape mechanism@xcite ( lower branch ) leaves the dnp unchanged .",
    "( b ) a real - space example of a hf - induced escape process from a triplet to the right contact through a singlet @xmath15 .",
    "this changes the dnp.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in this work , we analyze the leakage current and the dnp in the sb regime .",
    "finite dnp occurs due to a competition between ( i ) the hf - induced escape from the blocking states and ( ii ) another weaker inelastic escape mechanism such as co - tunneling or spin - orbit interaction  as in the works by rudner _",
    "et al_.@xcite the induced dnp acts back on the electronic energy levels of the dqd , which in turn change the transition rates until the steady state is reached .",
    "hence , we are dealing with a non - linear system with feedback present as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : feedback - illustration ] .",
    "we consider the gate - voltage configuration with _",
    "zero energy detuning _ , i.e.  the _ electrostatic _ energy of one electron in each dot and a singlet in the right dot is the same .",
    "thus , the external magnetic field is varied to get close to level crossings . the overhauser magnetic field from the dnp is different in each dot , which mixes the triplet and singlet states with zero total angular momentum projection.@xcite thus , we study two kinds of level crossings in detail : the crossing of the triplet ( like ) levels and the crossing between singlet and triplet levels .",
    "what we name the crossing of triplet levels is in fact the crossing of the pure spin - polarized triplets and the triplet that has a small mixing with the singlet subspace .",
    "hence , escape from the mixed state is possible .",
    "the main focus of this work is the presence and description of a _ transition temperature _ @xmath16 for the dnp . for temperatures @xmath8 below @xmath16",
    "the leakage current shows hysteresis versus the external magnetic field @xmath0 , while for @xmath17 the hysteresis disappears even though the system can still have a non - zero dnp .",
    "the transition temperature is related to a bistability of the dnp for @xmath18 , which is the reason for the current hysteresis .",
    "interestingly , we find that the transition temperatures for the crossing of the triplet levels near @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the singlet - triplet crossing at finite @xmath0-field , @xmath3 , respectively , are in general _ different _ and @xmath19 for typical parameters .",
    "thus , for @xmath20 current hysteresis is expected near the singlet - triplet level crossings at finite @xmath0-field , but _ not _ near the crossing of the triplet levels .",
    "the dnp in the sb regime is current induced and , hence , a result of a _ non - equilibrium _ situation .",
    "remarkably , _ spontaneous order _ of the nuclear spins in _",
    "equilibrium _ generally happens at orders of magnitude lower temperatures than @xmath2 and @xmath3 due to the weakness of dipole - dipole interaction among the nuclear spins.@xcite    we find the transition temperature @xmath2 analytically to be given _ only _ by the strength of the hf couplings in the dqd .",
    "this is derived from a simplified model valid in the limit of the singlets being far away in energy from the triplets , i.e.  at large exchange energy . to describe the singlet - triplet crossing",
    ", we also derive a simplified model leading to an implicit equation for the dnp .",
    "in contrast to @xmath2 , we find the transition temperature @xmath3 for the singlet - triplet crossing to depend on various parameters .",
    "the possibility of not conserving energy in the hf transitions is present in this work .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite include this effect as level broadening , whereas we allow for energy emission and absorption e.g.  by phonons in the hf rates .",
    "hence , energy absorption and emission in a hf process is _ equally likely _ in refs .",
    "in contrast , here the probability for energy absorption is exponentially suppressed compared to energy emission.@xcite we show that this is indeed an _ essential difference _ between this study and the previous ones,@xcite since the presence of both transition temperatures exactly stem from this asymmetry between energy emission and absorption .    in previous works by some of us,@xcite non - zero dnp in the sb regime arise due to the competition between hf - induced spin - flips and escape from the blocking states by tunneling through excited states in the right dot .",
    "in contrast , such excited states are assumed to be far away in energy in this work and , hence , do not play a role .",
    "moreover , we work with coherently coupled dots such that the inter - dot tunneling is not treated as a perturbation as in refs . [ ] .",
    "this approach , for instance , includes the expected triplet with zero angular momentum projection .",
    "moreover , previously@xcite phonon absorption processes were neglected , so the physics treated here regarding the transition temperature was missed .",
    "some of us have numerically studied a similar approach recently.@xcite however , in this case , the rate equation for the dnp turned out to be inappropriate , because hfi was taken to be the _ only _ escape mechanism from the blocking states .",
    "in contrast , here we find dnp to appear due to a competition between hf - induced escape and another inelastic escape mechanism .",
    "here we put our results from the rate equation approach on a firm basis by comparing to monte carlo simulations .",
    "furthermore , we point out in detail how the rate equation approach becomes sensitive to some initial occupations in the case without an inelastic escape path , and therefore become unable to describe the physical setup . moreover , we emphasize that this work contains many new insights and results compared to ref .

    "in passing , we note that even though the current expressions ( [ eq : current - non - equal - ine - rates ] ) and ( [ eq : current - general - for - ttt - crossing ] ) are similar , they have an interesting difference : _ without _ singlet - triplet mixing @xmath121 the current ( [ eq : current - non - equal - ine - rates ] ) still depends on the hf rate in contrast to the simpler case of the main text , see eq.([eq : current - for - zero - ts - mixing - parameter ] ) . in order to see this explicitly ,",
    "we insert @xmath121 and the tunneling rates ( [ eq : tunnel - in - rates]-[eq : tunnel - out - rates ] ) into the current expression ( [ eq : current - non - equal - ine - rates ] ) , i.e.    [ eq : current - non - equal - ine - rates - without - st - mixing ] @xmath421\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath359 was used for simplicity and @xmath422 \\nonumber\\\\ & + ( 6 \\gamma_{{\\uparrow},t_{\\mathfrak{p}}}^{\\textrm{ine } } + \\gamma_{{\\textrm{l } } } )   ( \\gamma_{{\\uparrow},t_-}^{\\textrm{ine } } + \\gamma_{{\\uparrow},t_+}^{\\textrm{ine } } ) + 4 \\gamma_{{\\uparrow},t_{\\mathfrak{p}}}^{\\textrm{ine } } \\gamma_{{\\textrm{l}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the current for @xmath121 still depends on the hf rate @xmath423 in general .    in summary , when the inelastic rates have the same invariances under interchange of indices as the tunneling rates , then the polarization equation ( [ eq : pol - condition - for - rates ] ) does not change and the current expression changes only slightly .",
    "however , if the inelastic rates are invariant under other interchange of indices , then the polarization condition ( [ eq : pol - condition - for - rates ] ) and the transition temperature might change .",
    "we implement all the possible transitions between the states @xmath424 as shown graphically on fig .  [",
    "fig : full - rate - eq - illustration ] .",
    "therefore , we are not limited to simulate a specific level crossing . for the transition probabilities in a single time step , we use the same functional dependences as for the rate expressions ( [ eq : equal - gamma - ine],[eq : tunnel - in - rates],[eq : tunnel - out - rates],[eq : tt - hf - rates],[eq : ts - hf - rates ] ) , since rates and probabilities are proportional . in the formulas ( [ eq : equal - gamma - ine],[eq :",
    "tunnel - in - rates],[eq : tunnel - out - rates ] ) , we exchange the rates @xmath425 by @xmath426 and @xmath189 by @xmath427 . for instance , @xmath428 is the probability for going to @xmath93 given that the system is in the one - electron state @xmath429 .",
    "likewise , we exchange the factor @xmath430 in the hf rates ( [ eq : tt - hf - rates],[eq : ts - hf - rates ] ) by the parameter @xmath431 in the hf probabilities .",
    "thereby we can tune the magnitude of the hf transition probabilities compared to the inelastic transition probabilities .",
    "thus , we can easily study the same physical situation as in the rate equation approach .",
    "for instance , figs .",
    "[ fig : p - vs - t - triplet - crossing ] and [ fig : mc - comparison - to - rate - eqs ] both study large singlet - triplet energy separation and zero magnetic field .    to minimize the computational load",
    ", we choose the transition probabilities within a single time step as _",
    "high _ as possible , such that the system does not remain in the same state over too many time steps .",
    "this can be understood as a long physical time duration for each time step .",
    "nevertheless , we have to choose numbers such that the sum of all probabilities for leaving a specific state is always _ smaller _ than one in each time step , e.g.  for @xmath93 this amounts to @xmath432 in this way , the possibility of staying in the same state ( here @xmath93 ) within a time step remains in the simulation .    in the real experiment , the polarization change by @xmath433 due to a _ single _ hf transition . in the simulation ,",
    "however , @xmath434 is increased substantially in order to obtain faster convergence to a stationary polarization .",
    "we emphasize that the choice of @xmath434 does _ not _ affect the value of the stationary polarization , but it does indeed affect the typical fluctuations around this value .",
    "thus , an artifact of choosing @xmath434 larger than @xmath435 is the artificially increased fluctuations around the stationary polarization  as seen figs .",
    "[ fig : mc - example - run ] and [ fig : mc - example - run - no - inelastic ]  compared to the experimental situation .",
    "however , since we are only interested in average values , this is not a concern here .",
    "choosing @xmath434 is therefore a compromise between maximizing convergence time and minimizing fluctuations .    in order to find the stationary dnp , we choose a @xmath434 , perform the monte carlo simulation a number of times for a given initial dnp and then average over the results .",
    "the averaging makes it easier to decide in a computationally cheap way , if convergence is reached . to make sure that the found stationary dnp @xmath436 is stable , we show that an initial dnp @xmath437 decreases versus time and that an initial dnp with @xmath438 increases versus time .",
    "we stress that the stationary dnp can also be found from doing the single monte carlo simulation as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc - example - run ] , but it requires a much smaller @xmath434 .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations in dnp increase with temperature , since higher @xmath8 increases the phonon - absorption hf transition probabilities , which increases the number of likely transitions ."
