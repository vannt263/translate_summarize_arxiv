    "the nature of three - dimensional space - filling disordered networks is salient to a variety of topics in scientific research . despite work in recent decades ,",
    "a number of puzzles remain both about the structure and connectivity of such networks . also",
    ", important quantities _ derived from _ such structures ( such as electronic or vibrational states ) are quite incompletely understood , though their characteristics are ultimately derivative from the underlying structure . in this paper , we systematically consider a collection of ( largely ) tetrahedral continuous random networks of amorphous si , and and despite the fact that several of these are quite  standard \" , we detect and report novel features of their connectivity and electronic structure .    the character of the tail states in disordered semiconductors is a problem of importance with a history dating back at least to the sixties .",
    "it has long been understood that band tail states in amorphous semiconductors arise from strains in the network sufficient to push states past the band edges into the gap .",
    "such tails decay exponentially into the gap : this feature , nearly universal to disordered semiconductors , is called urbach tailing . @xcite",
    "clever photoemission experiments allow the separate observation of the valence and conduction tails and even the temperature dependence of the tailing @xcite .",
    "several theories have been presented to explain the urbach tails , most recently by cohen and coworkers .",
    "@xcite    beside band tailing and the detailed structure of the networks we study , our work is related to the general problem of the topology of space - filling networks . for example , work on the cuprates @xcite provides clear , albeit circumstantial evidence for the existence of percolating filamentary networks , and is seen in stm measurements @xcite ( presumably two - d projections of the three - d filamentary network ) .",
    "filamentary paths are also believed to exist in fast ion conducting glasses with larger than average free volume @xcite regions providing pathways for ion transport ( see for example fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . farther afield",
    ", results akin to ours ( the percolation of short bonds ) can be inferred in protein binding in a yeast @xcite .",
    "this paper has two immediate aims .",
    "first , consideration of several models reveals certain persistent geometrical features , notably strong self - correlations between configurations involving short bonds and analogous correlations involving long bonds . to the extent that these correlations exist in various structural models and survive _ ab initio _ thermal molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    ", it seems worthwhile to point these out .",
    "the second aim is to discuss general features of the band tail states in a - si .",
    "resonant cluster proliferation of tail and gap states is observed @xcite , and filamentary connections between  localization centers . in agreement with earlier reports @xcite",
    ", we observe a robust tendency for valence ( conduction ) tail states to be associated with short ( long ) bonds .",
    "unlike our earlier report @xcite , we did detect analogous features for the bond angle distribution , where we see that smaller ( larger ) bond angles are correlated with valence ( conduction ) tails .",
    "these general observations about the tail states in a - si are relevant to calculations of transport , since it is presumably just these states through which carriers hop , as we discuss in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "even in good quality unhydrogenated material , mid - gap defects are fairly rare , at most a few sites per thousand @xcite . at a practical level",
    "this means that ideal models of tractable size ( up to several thousand atoms ) can contain zero to a few defects producing mid - gap states .",
    "the wooten - weaire - winer ( www ) @xcite method is the gold standard  for forming such realistic models , and several of the models we discuss depend upon www at least as a starting point . for completeness , and in particular to ascertain the extent to which our observations might tend to be www artifacts , we have repeated the calculations for other models as well .",
    "we summarize some salient features of the models in table i.    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 .",

    "we include model m@xmath12 , a paracrystalline  model ( crn with crystalline inclusion ) .",
    "in particular for m@xmath12 , 211 crystalline silicon atoms are embedded .",
    "excepting m@xmath12 , all the models that we have studied here have normally distributed bond lengths and cosines of bond angles . for the large www models the similarity to the normal distribution is quite striking @xcite . here",
    "we report the bond length and bond angle distributions for these models in fig .",
    "model m@xmath5 and m@xmath11 show nearly perfect gaussian fits , while model m@xmath14 , ( a 500-atom model ) , is fairly gaussian , with statistical noise .",

    "the pair correlation functions of these models are all similar , accurately reflecting the experimental function . as usual with a - si",
    ", this is a reminder that the information in the pair - correlation function alone is very insufficient to specify coordinates .",
    "our inspection of the topology of the models reveals that there is a tendency for short bonds to be linked to other short bonds and long bonds to be linked to other long bonds .",
    "in particular , this leads to 1 ) a tendency to spatial separation of the shortest and the longest bonds in the system ; 2 ) a tendency to build up chain and ring like structures among extreme bonds .",

    "while there were slight modifications in structure due to the cg process , we did nt observed any significant changes in these correlations .      to further explore the likelihood that the long and short inter bond correlations were artifacts , we also undertook thermal md simulations at 300k on two small models ( m@xmath8 and m@xmath9 ) with the code siesta .",

    "interestingly , in both case , the atoms locate closely ( localization ) and happen to form filament ( chain ) like structures .",

    "are shown in fig .",
    "we see that , for all these models , these localized atoms form filament - like structures in general . the strength of the effect varies only slightly among the models .",
    "fedders , drabold , nakhmanson s study @xcite observed that valence tail states preferentially involved short bond lengths , whereas conduction tail states tended to be involved with longer bond lengths .",
    "angle distortion was also mentioned but no specific relation to the band tails was detected .",
    "related work was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we extend this analysis to our collection of models .",
    "where the bond lengths are concerned , the present work is consistent with these findings .",
    "in addition we also clearly detect a correlation between valence tail and small bond angle , and a correlation between conduction tail and large bond angle , which has not been explicitly observed before .",
    "an electron(mulliken charge)-weighted mean bond length for each state was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it revealed an interesting and general trend in bond lengths .",
    "here we computed the mean bond length in a similar fashion , and explored into seven of our models for this mean value .",
    "we then extended the calculations into the mean bond angles , using the very same mulliken charge .",
    "for a certain eigenstate @xmath29 , the mulliken charge @xmath30 is the electron probability on an atom @xmath31 . using it as a weighting factor , we define the corresponding symmetrized mean bond length as @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33where @xmath34 summations _ only _ go over all the possible bonds in a unit cell ( of @xmath35 atoms ) , with @xmath34 as the bond end atoms .",
    "@xmath30 , as defined , is the electron probability on the atom n. @xmath32 ( near the fermi level ) for each model is plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath32 shows an asymmetrical split around the gap ( fermi level ) for all models .",
    "smaller average bond lengths are correlated to the valence tails and large average bond lengths correlated to the conduction tails .",
    "there are clear difference among the seven models , especially on the mid - gap states from the models with high defect concentration . for models with fewer defect states in the gap ,",
    "the bond - electron correlations are very clear .",
    "models with many mid - gap states show mixed behavior , though the asymmetric splitting is always detectable .    in analogy with the discussion for bond lengths ,",
    "we define the electron - weighted mean of bond angles as : @xmath36where @xmath37 are the atoms of the unit cell of @xmath35 atoms ; summations of n , m , l _ only _ count over all the possible bond angles , with m as the vertex of each angle .",
    "@xmath30 , as defined , is the electron probability on the atom n. @xmath38 is plotted in fig .",
    "it also shows a clear asymmetrical splitting around the gap for all plots .",
    "smaller average bond angles clearly appear to be correlated to the valence tails and larger average bond angles correlated to the conduction tails .",
    "there are also differences among the models but the asymmetric feature remains .",
    "interestingly , these angle - electron correlations show strong resemblance to the bond - electron correlations discussed above .",
    "it is also natural to connect these correlations to the filamentary structures shown in fig .",
    "f09 . for m@xmath5 , which is a typical example , the structure from state # 1024 ( a valence tail state ) has both short bonds and small bond angles along the chain , while # 1025 ( a conduction tail state ) has both long bonds and large bond angles along the chain .    one feature to note",
    "is that here only the energies near the fermi level are shown . in our models ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath32 also have extrema in other spectral gaps , whenever the states are fairly localized .",
    "here we offer some heuristic explanation of the last two sections . in a - si , there are two kinds of random potentials leading to the localization of carriers :  point defect ( missing atoms or impurities ) and topological disorder .",
    "the former produces very localized states which lie in the neighborhood of the fermi level .",
    "these are bound states around the point defects , and sit in the middle of gap .",
    "the scattering suffered by the carriers is so strong that the localization length of those states is smaller than the average bond length ( for example , the lone electron in dangling bond ) .",
    "@xcite in contrast , topological disorder , the deviation of bond lengths and bond angles from their crystalline values , produces localized states primarily lying in the tails of the valence band and the conduction band .",
    "the localization length of those tail states may extend from one bond length to a range including many atoms depending on the structure of the network .",
    "band tails exhibit localization because the density of states in their energy range is small , and there is less opportunity for delocalization via mixing , as discussed in the  resonant cluster proliferation \" model .",
    "@xcite in this picture , it is doubtful that a an initially localized energy state could persist in the midst of a continuum ; it would inevitably mix with the reservoir of resonant states , if there was any overlap between the reservoir and localized state .",
    "similarly , a well - localized state would survive if placed in a region of zero density of states . from this point of view , the band tails are simply between these limits .    according to the scattering theory of solids , @xcite the distortion of the atomic configuration from crystal mixes bloch states with different band indices and wave vectors .",
    "if these secondary scattering components have large enough phase shifts relative to the primary bloch wave outside the distorted region , they will interfere destructively , because the phase memory related to the primary bloch wave has been lost . while inside the distorted region , secondary scattering components are almost in - phase with the primary bloch wave ( phase shift is less than @xmath39 ) , and they will interfere constructively inside this region . thus if a distorted region can produce scattered components with large momentum transfer , a localized state can be formed by the interference of secondary components with the primary bloch wave .    with this mechanism , it is possible that several localized states have peaks in the same distorted regions .",
    "this was observed in previous work @xcite on m@xmath40 .",
    "we explored other models , m@xmath11 and m@xmath14 , and found similar states with overlapping clusters in space . on the other hand , one localized state may have several peaks in structurally distorted regions which are spatially separated ( fig .",
    "[ f09 ] ) .",
    "the observation that valence tail states are preferentially localized on short bonds and conduction tail states localized on long bonds ( fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) can be understood as follows .",
    "short bond length has two consequences : ( 1 ) it will increase the transition integral ; the energy of valence band states are lowered while the energy of conduction states is lifted relative to a hypothetical reference crystal ( diamond for a - si ) ; ( 2 ) small bond lengths increase the charge at the center of the bonds ( states near valence edge ) .",
    "thus if we make the significant assumption that the valence and conduction tails should be associated with either short or long bonds , it is clear that the electronic ( band - energy ) is optimized if the valence tails are associated with short bonds , and the long bonds would  do the least damage \" if put above the fermi - level , or linked with the conduction tail .",
    "this completely neglects other contributions to the total energy , though the observation of the effect in density functional calculations suggests that the band energy _",
    "is _ the key term .",
    "we have discovered significant and reasonably model - independent features of the network and electronic structure of a - si .",
    "we believe that the results may prove relevant to a number of other systems as well .",
