    "if @xmath3 is a finite set of primes , we define the set of _ @xmath0-units _ to be those integers of the shape @xmath4 , with exponents @xmath5 nonnegative integers .",
    "the arithmetic of such sets has been frequently studied due to its connections to a wide variety of problems in number theory and arithmetic geometry . in the latter direction , equations of the shape @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath0-units for certain specific sets @xmath0 ,",

    "for a given set of primes @xmath0 , we may consider equations of the shape @xmath24 with @xmath25 an integer , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath0-units , and @xmath26 a nonzero integer .",
    "we will call such a quadruple  @xmath27 a _ primitive _ solution of ( [ enn ] ) if @xmath28 is @xmath29th - power free .",
    "such equations are the main topic of discussion in chapter 9 of shorey and tijdeman @xcite , due to their connections to the problem of characterizing perfect powers in nondegenerate binary recurrence sequences of algebraic numbers .",
    "if we write @xmath30 in equation ( [ enn ] ) , with @xmath31 @xmath29th - power free ( whereby there are at most @xmath32 choices for @xmath31 ) , then it follows from the theory of thue - mahler equations that , for a fixed value of @xmath33 , the set of primitive solutions @xmath27 of ( [ enn ] ) is finite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  7.2 ) ) .",
    "a stronger statement still is the following ( essentially theorem 9.2 of @xcite ) :    [ shti - thm9.2 ] there are only finitely many coprime @xmath0-units @xmath34 and @xmath35 for which there exist integers  @xmath36 and  @xmath37 such that  @xmath38 .    the aim of this paper is to illustrate the use of frey - hellegouarch curves in solving equations like ( [ two ] ) and , more generally ,  ( [ enn ] ) .",
    "specifically , we will apply such an approach to provide a new proof of theorem [ shti - thm9.2 ] that _ a priori _ avoids the use of lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms , instead combining frey - hellegouarch curves , modularity and level - lowering , with the aforementioned theorem of shafarevich . in fairness , it must be mentioned , that effective versions of the latter result have typically depended fundamentally on linear forms in logarithms ; for recent papers along these lines , see the work of fuchs , von knel and wstholz @xcite and von knel @xcite .",

    "section [ sec2 ] introduces our basic notation . in section [ s : finiteness ] , we show how to obtain various finiteness results currently proved with techniques from diophantine approximation , via frey - hellegouarch curves over @xmath40 .",
    "philosophically , this bears a strong resemblance to recent work of von knel @xcite and of murty and pasten @xcite .",

    "it should be emphasized that this is not a `` serious '' application of our method , but merely meant as an illustration of a partial converse of the connection between solving equations of the shape ( [ enn ] ) and computing elliptic curves . the reader may wish to omit these sections at first ( and , for that matter , subsequent ) readings . a more interesting result along these lines is due to kim @xcite , where the connection between more general cubic thue - mahler equation and shafarevich s theorem is mapped out .",
    "section [ s : all_solutions ] contains , as previously mentioned , the main result of the paper , namely an explicit solution of equation ( [ enn ] ) for the sets @xmath1 and @xmath47 .",
    "the techniques we employ to prove these results , besides the aforementioned use of frey - hellegouarch curves and their associated modular forms , are local methods and appeal to computer algebra packages for solving thue and thue - mahler equations ; for the last of these , we rely extensively upon the computational number theory packages magma @xcite , pari @xcite and sage @xcite .",
