    "quite remarkably , a different description of quantum nature for @xmath18 geometrically frustrated af networks yields similar results .",
    "as first elaborated by anderson,@xcite and validated through numerical calculations , the ground state can be constructed on spin singlet pairs and not on non magnetic triangles ( or tetrahedras).@xcite in particular , numerical studies point at the existence of a `` gap '' in the magnetic excitation spectrum of the kagom @xmath18 network,@xcite and maybe in the pyrochlore @xmath18 network.@xcite the term gap is actually inappropriate as a continuum of singlet states is imbedded between the singlet ground state and the first excited triplet state .",

    "in this section , we focus on the dilution - dependent susceptibility revealed by the nmr linewidth at low-@xmath10 . we show that the low-@xmath10 paramagnetic behavior observed in @xmath30 originates from the dilution of the kagom bi - layer .",

    "the ga(@xmath36)-nmr width not only enables to evidence that the vacancy of a spin on the network , i.e. the dilution , generates a paramagnetic defect , but also allows to shed light on the more fundamental question concerning the nature of the defect .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] we present the low-@xmath10 macroscopic susceptibility of most of the samples studied .",
    "the low-@xmath10 paramagnetic upturn of @xmath57 is observed at all the concentrations , increasing in an appreciable way with growing dilution .",
    "this establishes that the origin of this contribution is related to the ga / cr substitution .",
    "the non magnetic gallium vacancy on the network must therefore induce a perturbation which affects the neighboring magnetic cr@xmath3 ions . a paramagnetic defect",

    "in order to determine the exact low-@xmath10 dependence of the susceptibility associated with the defects , the contribution to @xmath30 of both @xmath59 and @xmath60 should in principle not be neglected .",
    "since @xmath59 can not be determined through nmr below 15 k , we follow ref .   and",

    "the fits , shown by a solid line in fig .  [ fig:14 ] for the @xmath6 sample , were performed in the @xmath63 k @xmath64 k range for all the samples and reproduce correctly the low-@xmath10 behavior of @xmath30 .",

    "@xcite    the fact that the @xmath76ga(@xmath36 ) linewidth increases rapidly at low-@xmath10 and with the dilution , whereas the shift varies little , establishes the existence of a susceptibility that is _ spatially inhomogeneous _ over the kagom bi - layer , due to the defects associated with the ga / cr substitution . since the ga(@xmath36 )",
    "nuclei are only coupled to the kagom bi - layer , the _ defects _ probed by ga - nmr are necessarily _ localized in the kagom bi - layer_.    the effect associated to the dilution is not reduced to a mere suppression of a cr site without any magnetic signature over the neighboring spins ( i.e. a magnetic defect ) as indicated by the large modification of the @xmath76ga(@xmath36 ) lineshape at low-@xmath10 . indeed , in the opposite case",

    "two models describe the dilution effects in a geometrically frustrated system .",
    "both are constructed in a classical approach where the ground state corresponds to a minimization of the exchange energies on triangles ( or tetrahedras ) of spins .",
    "the most recent model was proposed by moessner _",
    "et al_.@xcite the basic idea here is that a paramagnetic moment in the kagom network is generated when two vacancies are adjacent on a triangle ( 3 adjacent vacancies are needed for the pyrochlore network ) .",
    "the defect corresponds in this case to a unique spin of the network , and at low dilution the defect s susceptibility is @xmath93 for the kagom network ( @xmath94 for the pyrochlore network ) .",
    "this prediction is in striking contrast with the linear variation of the nmr width on dilution reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] . to reconcile our data to the theory of ref .",
    ", it was suggested in ref .   that the magnetic broadening of the width may reflect a distribution of random local fields ( @xmath95 ) , due to the coupling of each gallium nucleus to the 12 neighboring cr sites of the kagom bi - layer .",
    "basically , the nmr width @xmath96 would then probe the mean deviation of the susceptibility on these 12 sites ( and not simply @xmath62 ) , thus @xmath97 .",
    "although appealing , this scenario is quite unlikely since the macroscopic susceptibility measurements which are insensitive to the effect of a local summation of fields , do not yield a quadratic @xmath98 variation on dilution .",
    "the second model @xmath37 purely empirical @xmath37 was proposed in ref .  .",
    "there , a defect is generated by a vacancy which perturbs the neighboring spins , uncorrelating them from the rest of the spin network .",
    "these uncorrelated spins were baptized `` orphan '' spins .",
    "two distinct spin populations then coexist : the orphan spins with a paramagnetic behavior making up the defect , and the frustrated spins outside the defect with a susceptibility equal to @xmath59 . in order to examine the implications of the orphan model on the ga(@xmath36)-nmr low-@xmath10 spectrum , we assume , as a starting point , that the defect is built only on the orphan spins nearest neighbors ( n.n . ) of the vacancy ( fig .",

    "[ fig:16 ] ) , this clearly demonstrates that _ the origin of the sg state is not related to the dilution - induced defects_. whether a small residual @xmath141-independent curie term associated with intrinsic ( topological ) defects might explain the freezing is still a matter of speculation as higher cr - concentrations than @xmath142 would be necessary to conclude .",
    "to summarize , our nmr and macroscopic susceptibility results agree perfectly with a picture of a defect built on the af correlations of the frustrated network . in conclusion",
    "we now elaborate on the effective value of the paramagnetic moment detected in the low-@xmath10 macroscopic susceptibility .",
    "following eq.([eqn : susdef ] ) and from the @xmath68 constant of tab .",
    "[ tab:4 ] , we deduce a nearly @xmath141-independent value for the defect effective magnetic moment of @xmath101 smaller than the expected 3.87 @xmath143 value for a free @xmath4 spin .",
    "the weak ratio @xmath144 of tab .",
    "[ tab:4 ] is then simply explained in this viewpoint since @xmath145 .",
    "we can either speculate that the geometric frustration might diminish the efficiency of the polarization induced by the vacancy , indication that the nature of the defect is complex or the paramagnetic defect can be modeled into a @xmath18 spin quantum state .",
    "also , in the case where @xmath128 results from the sum of the oscillating spin polarization there is no reason to find a @xmath146 value .",
    "further theoretical work in this direction is indeed required to model the defect and achieve a quantitative understanding of our data .",
    "the scgo kagom bi - layer compound was studied for the first time through a local probe over a wide variety of cr - concentrations .",
    "new and original properties were unravelled for the archetype of geometrically frustrated compounds .",
    "ga(@xmath36)-nmr allowed us to observe the kagom bi - layer susceptibility @xmath59 , otherwise non accessible by macroscopic measurements .",
    "a maximum in @xmath59 occurs at a temperature @xmath147 , robust to a dilution as high as @xmath9 .",
    "no gaped feature is evidenced .",
    "the maximum signals the appearance of short ranged magnetic correlations in the kagom bi - layer , as observed in all the af @xmath13 heisenberg systems .",
    "@xmath148 is a new energy scale for scgo , which sets a new constraint on the theoretical models .",
    "a close examination of the dilution effects by ga(@xmath36)-nmr allowed us to establish , on a firm experimental ground , that paramagnetic defects are present on the kagom bi - layer .",
    "the defects stem from the vacancies in the spin network , i.e. from the substitution of magnetic cr@xmath3 ions with non magnetic ga@xmath3 ions .",
    "the defects are responsible for the low-@xmath10 curie upturn of @xmath30 .",
    "the macroscopic susceptibility therefore does not probe an intrinsic property of the kagom bi - layer at low-@xmath10 , but mainly a property related to the dilution .",
    "interestingly , the sg transition is detected precisely in the low-@xmath10 upturn of @xmath30 .",
    "as there are experimental signatures suggesting that this transition is an intrinsic feature of scgo , @xcite this means that the defects do not trigger the freezing , but do freeze at @xmath26 .",
    "the origin of the sg transition remains to be elucidated .    finally , we proposed a mechanism that justifies the existence of the paramagnetic defects , which , to our knowledge , is the only one that gives a consistent interpretation for both the ga(@xmath36)-nmr and the macroscopic susceptibility results .",
    "our nmr data point at a defect which possesses strong analogies with the defects observed in most of the af correlated systems @xmath37 where the presence of a vacancy ( or a magnetic impurity ) generates a staggered response from the spin network . up to now",
    ", the dilution in scgo , or more generally in the frustrated systems , has been considered a parasitical effect to be minimized in order to measure the intrinsic properties related to the geometric frustration . in light of our results",
    ", it is interesting to reverse the problematic .",
    "the study of the response from the magnetic lattice to a non magnetic vacancy can be an indirect way of probing the intrinsic properties of the frustrated network such as @xmath134 or @xmath149 .",
    "the experimental study and the theoretical models to describe this response are a new domain of investigation for the geometrically frustrated systems .",

    "their states are labeled by their total spin quantum number , @xmath152 , and lie at energies @xmath153 relative to the ground state . the partition function for @xmath154 independent pairs ( @xmath155 being the total number of spins involved in pair formation ) is @xmath156 ^{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the degeneracy of each level and @xmath158 .",
