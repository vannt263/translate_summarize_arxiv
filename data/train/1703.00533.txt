    "over time , human societies develop systems of belief , languages , technology and artistic forms which collectively may be called _",
    "culture_. the formation of culture requires individuals to have ideas , and then for others to copy them .",
    "historically , most copying has required face - to - face interaction , and because most human beings tend to remain localized in geographical regions which are small in comparison to the world , then human culture can take quite different forms in different places .",
    "one aspect of culture where geographical distribution has been studied in great detail is dialect @xcite .    in order to visualize the spatial extent of dialects ,",
    "dialectologists have traditionally drawn _",
    "isoglosses _ : lines enclosing the domain within which a particular linguistic feature ( a word , a phoneme or an element of syntax ) is used .",
    "however , it is not usually the case that language use changes abruptly at an isogloss - typically there is a transition zone where a mixture of alternative features is used @xcite . in fact , there is debate about whether the most appropriate way to view the geographical organization of dialects is as a set of distinct areas , or as a continuum without sharp boundaries @xcite . whereas an isogloss represents the extent of an individual feature , a recognisable dialect is typically a combination of many distinctive features @xcite . we can attempt to distinguish dialects by superposing many different isoglosses , but often they do not coincide @xcite leading to ambiguous conclusions",
    "the first steps toward an objective , quantitative analysis of the shapes of dialect areas were made by sguy @xcite , who examined large aggregates of features , making comparison between lexical distances and geographic separations .",
    "central to the quantitative study of dialects , called _ dialectometry _ ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , is the measurement of linguistic distance which , for example , can be viewed as the smallest number of insertions , deletions or substitutions of language features needed to transform one segment of speech into another @xcite . using a metric of this kind , a set of dialect observations can be grouped into clusters according to their linguistic ( as opposed to spatial ) closeness @xcite .",
    "the clusters then define geographical dialect areas .",
    "the question we address is _ why _ dialect domains have particular spatial forms , and to give a quantitative answer requires a model .",
    "the question has been addressed in the past , famously ( amongst dialectologists ) by trudgill @xcite , with his `` gravity model '' . according to this",
    ", the strength of linguistic interaction between two population centres is proportional to the product of their populations , divided by the square of the distance between them .",
    "the _ influence _ of a city @xmath0 on another , @xmath1 , is then defined to be the product of interaction strength with the ratio @xmath2 where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are population sizes of cities @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these additive influence scores may then be used to predict the progress of a linguistic change which originated in one city , by determining the cities over which it exerts greatest net influence .",
    "it is assumed that the change progresses from city to city in a _",
    "cascade_. predictions may also be made regarding the combined influence of cities on neighbouring non - urban areas .",
    "the model has been partially successful in predicting observed sequences of linguistic change @xcite , and offers some qualitative insight into the most likely positions of isoglosses @xcite . in this paper",
    "we offer an alternative model , also based on population data , which makes use of ideas from statistical mechanics . rather than starting with a postulate about the nature of interactions between population centres , we begin with assumptions about the interactions between speakers . from these assumptions about small scale behaviour",
    "we derive predictions about macroscopic behaviour .",
    "this approach has the advantage of making clear the link between individual human interactions , and population level behaviour .",
    "moreover we are able to unambiguously define the dynamics of the model , and make precise predictions about the locations of isoglosses , the nature of transition regions between linguistic forms , and the most likely structure of dialect domains .",
    "there are links between our approach and agent based models of language change @xcite , which directly simulate the behaviour individuals .",
    "the difference between this approach and ours lies in the fact that for us , assumptions about individual behaviour lead to equations for language evolution which are macroscopic in character .",
    "these equations have considerable analytical tractability and offer a simple and intuitive picture of the large scale spatial processes at play .    in seeking to model the spatial distribution of language beginning with the individual , we are encouraged by the fact that dialects are created through a vast number of complex interactions between millions of people .",
    "these people are analogous to atoms in the physical context , and when very large numbers of particles interact in physical systems , simple macroscopic laws are often at play . despite",
    "the fact dialects are the product of hundreds of years of linguistic and cultural evolution @xcite , so historical events must have played a role in creating their spatial distribution @xcite , the physical analogy suggests that it may be possible to formulate approximate statistical laws which play a powerful role in their spatial evolution .",
    "a physical effect analogous to the formation of dialects is _ phase ordering _",
    "this occurs , for example , in ferromagnetic materials , where each atom attempts to align itself with neighbours .",
    "if the material is two dimensional ( a flat sheet ) this leads to the formation of a patchwork of domains where all atoms are aligned with others in the same domain , but not with those in other domains .",
    "the boundaries between these regions of aligned atoms evolve so as to minimize boundary length @xcite .",
    "the human agents who interact to form dialects behave in roughly the same way ( as do some birds @xcite ) .",
    "when people speak and listen to each other , they have a tendency conform to the patterns of speech they hear others using , and therefore to ` align ' their dialects .",
    "since people typically remain geographically localized in their everyday lives , they tend to align with those nearby .",
    "this local copying gives rise to dialects in the same way that short range atomic interactions give rise to domains in ferromagnets .",
    "whereas the atoms in a ferromagnet are regularly spaced , human population density is variable .",
    "we will show that as a result , stable boundaries between domains become curved lines .",
    "our aim is to define a model of speech copying which incorporates as few assumptions as possible , whilst allowing the effect of local linguistic interaction and movement to be investigated .",
    "the model has its roots in the ideas of the linguist leonard bloomfield @xcite who believed that the speech pattern of an individual constantly evolved through his or her life via pairwise interaction .",
    "this microscopic view of language change lead to the prediction that the diffusion of linguistic features should follow routes with the greatest _ density of communication_. bloomfield defined this as the density of conversational links between speakers accumulated over a given period of time . in our model",
    "the analogy of this link density is an interaction kernel weighted by spatial variations in population distribution .",
    "we implicitly assume that interaction is inherently local so that linguistic changes spread via _ normal contact _ @xcite , rather than via major displacements , conquests , or dispersion of settled communities .",
    "we are therefore modelling language in stable settlements , with initial conditions set by the most recent major population upheaval .",
    "we consider a population of speakers , each of whom has a small home neighbourhood , and we introduce a population density , @xmath5 , giving the spatial variation of the number homes per unit area . in order to incorporate local human movement within the model ,",
    "we begin by defining a gaussian _ interaction kernel _ for each speaker @xmath6 consider a speaker , _ anna _ , whose home neighbourhood is centred on @xmath7 . in the absence of variation in population density",
    ", @xmath8 is the normalized distribution of the relative positions , @xmath9 , of the home neighbourhoods of speakers with whom anna regularly interacts .",
    "the constant @xmath10 , the _ interaction range _ , is a measure of the typical geographical distance between the neighbourhoods of interacting speakers .",
    "now suppose that density is not uniform due to the presence of a city , or a sparsely populated mountainous area . in this case",
    "while anna is going about her daily life she is more likely to hold conversations with people whose homes lie in a nearby densely populated region because these people constitute a greater proportion of the local population . to incorporate this density effect",
    "we define a normalized _ weighted interaction kernel _ for a home at @xmath7 @xmath11 given any region @xmath12 , the fraction of anna s interactions that are with people who live in @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "we distinguish between dialects by constructing a set of _ linguistic variables _ whose values vary between dialects . a single variable might , for example , be the pronunciation of the vowel _ u _ in the words ` but ' and ` up ' @xcite . in england , northerners use a long form : ` boott ' and ` oopp ' , with phonetic symbol [ ] , and southerners use a short version , [ ] . considering a single variable which we suppose has @xmath14 variants",
    ", we define @xmath15 to be the relative frequency with which the @xmath0th variant of our variable is used by speakers in the neighbourhood of @xmath16 , at time @xmath17 . for mathematical simplicity",
    "we assume that nearby speakers use language in a similar way , so that @xmath15 varies smoothly with position .",
    "people speak on average 16,000 words per day @xcite and can take months or years ( depending on their age and background ) to adapt their speech to local forms @xcite .",
    "changing speech habits therefore involves a very large number of word exchanges , at least in the tens of thousands ( comparable in magnitude to typical vocabulary size @xcite ) .",
    "although the rate at which individuals adapt their speech is not constant throughout life ( it is particularly rapid in the young ) , adaptation has been observed even in late middle age @xcite . to capture the cumulative effect of linguistic interaction",
    "we make use of a _ forgetting curve _ , which measures the relative importance of recent interactions to older ones . from a mathematical point of view , the simplest form for this curve is an exponential , and in fact there is some evidence from experiments involving word recall @xcite which suggests that this is an appropriate choice .",
    "however , we emphasize that the curve , for us , is simply a way to capture the fact that current speech patterns depend on past interactions and that than older interactions tend to be less important . with this in mind",
    "we make the following definition of the memory of a speaker from the neighbourhood of @xmath16 , for the @xmath0th variant of a variable @xmath18 ds \\label{eq : mint } \\\\",
    "\\approx   \\int_{-\\infty}^{t } & \\frac{e^{\\frac{s - t}{\\tau}}}{\\tau }   \\big [ f_i(x , y , s ) \\nonumber    \\\\   & +   \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\rho(x , y ) } \\nabla^2 \\{\\rho(x , y ) f_i(x , y , s ) \\}\\big]ds .",
    "\\label{eq : m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we call the parameter @xmath19 , _ memory length _ , and note that changing its value simply rescales the unit of time : it measures the rate of change of spatial distribution .",
    "we note also that this form of memory may be seen as a deterministic spatial version of the discrete stochastic memory used in the utterance selection model @xcite . on the grounds that speakers collect very large samples of local linguistic information , our definition does not contain terms representing random sampling error . in going from equation ( [ eq : mint ] ) to ( [ eq : m ] )",
    "we have used the saddle point method @xcite to approximate the spatial integral in equation ( [ eq : mint ] ) and assumed that @xmath20 is small compared to @xmath21 ( that is , population changes approximately linearly over the length scale of human interaction ) .    to allow speakers to base their current speech on what they have heard in the past we let @xmath15 be a function , @xmath22 , of the set of memories @xmath23 @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] differentiating equation ( [ eq : m ] ) with respect to @xmath17 , and rescaling the units of time so that one time unit is equal to one memory length @xmath19",
    ", we obtain @xmath25 - m_i(x , y , t ) \\\\",
    "+ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\rho(x , y ) } \\nabla^2 \\{\\rho(x , y ) p_i[{\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{m}}}(x , y , t ) ] \\ } , \\label{evo}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which governs the spatial evolution of the @xmath0th alternative for a single linguistic variable .",
    "we note that memory length no longer appears as a parameter .",
    "the simplest possible choice for @xmath22 is to let speakers use each variant with the same frequency that they remember it being used : @xmath26 = m_i(x , y , t)$ ] .",
    "this produces `` neutral evolution '' @xcite where there is no bias in the evolution of each variant .",
    "equation ( [ evo ] ) then describes pure diffusion , and variants spread out uniformly over the system .",
    "if all linguistic variables evolved in this way we would eventually have one spatially homogeneous mixture of grammar , pronunciation and vocabulary .",
    "if our memory model involved a stochastic component @xcite then eventually we would expect all but one variant of each variable to disappear .",
    "neither of these outcomes reflects the reality of locally distinctive forms of language .",
    "we motivate our choice for @xmath22 based on two observations .",
    "the first is that dialects exist . in order for this to be the case , the non diffusive term , @xmath26 - m_i(x , y , t)$ ] , in our evolution equation ( [ evo ] )",
    "must contain some locally stable fixed points .",
    "the second observation is derived from experiments on social learning , which show that the behaviour of individuals is considerably influenced by the majority opinion of those with whom they interact @xcite .",
    "in fact , such social conformity is widely observed in the animal kingdom and is responsible for the formation of dialects in some species of birds @xcite .",
    "recent experimental research into human social learning @xcite , in which individuals were allowed to make a choice , before being exposed to the opinions of a group , has revealed that the likelihood of an individual switching their decision depends non - linearly on the proportion of the group who disagree .",
    "it is an increasing function which climbs rapidly when the proportion exceeds @xmath27 , also possessing an inflection for large groups . in the context of language",
    ", such non - linear conforming behaviour would mean that variants which were used more frequently than others should be used with disproportionately large frequency in the future .",
    "a simple way to capture this behaviour is to define @xmath28 where @xmath29 measures the extent of conformity ( non - neutrality ) .",
    "if @xmath30 then we have the neutral model , and for @xmath31 the non - diffusive term in ( [ evo ] ) has a stable fixed point at @xmath32 .",
    "according to ( [ eqn : pk ] ) , individuals disproportionately favour the most common variants they have heard : they have a tendency to _ conform _ to the local majority language use with @xmath33 measuring the strength of this effect . in the limit @xmath34 all speakers use the only the most common ( modal ) dialect they have heard .",
    "conforming behaviour allows _",
    "local _ dialects to form , as we shall see below .",
    "the model we have defined is a `` coarse - grained '' description of real linguistic interactions which in reality are much more complex .",
    "much of this complexity arises because there are often many distinct class , ethnic or age - defined social networks in any given geographical region . within each of these subgroups",
    "the need to conform leads to similar speech patterns among members , and these patterns often , but not always , spread to other groups .",
    "research by linguists has demonstrated that social factors strongly influence the uptake of particular speech patterns @xcite and that language use is correlated with social class and identity . in american english , for example ,",
    "language change is often initiated by the working and lower middle classes @xcite , before spreading to other groups .",
    "some forms of language change are driven by resistance to conformity ; for example `` prestige dialects '' ( received pronunciation in the uk ) are used to signify membership of a social elite , set apart from the common people . the desire to set oneself apart from others",
    "can also create reversals in language use amongst subsets of a population .",
    "for example , local residents of martha s vineyard @xcite reverted to an archaic form of pronunciation in order reaffirm local tradition in the face of invading tourists .",
    "a similar effect was observed on the island of ocracoke in north carolina @xcite , but in this case the reversal was temporary . as well as social factors , language use may also be determined by age , gender or ethnicity @xcite .",
    "it is clear that reality is far more complex than our simple model , which does not make any of these distinctions between speakers .",
    "however , the fact that dialects exists is itself evidence that in general people do adapt to local speech patterns . to model every speaker as having the same need to conform is therefore a reasonable first approximation to reality . it also has the value of simplicity , allowing us later to determine the importance of various additional levels of complexity by comparing how effectively our model fits empirical data when compared more complex models .",
    "model from randomized initial condition with @xmath35 km and @xmath36 at times @xmath37 , where one time unit corresponds to one memory length .",
    "colours indicate which variant is most common at each position . numerical solution implemented in c++ on grid with 2 km spacing @xcite ( gb is @xmath38 km north to south ) .",
    "each grid point initialized with randomly selected variant . ]",
    "we apply our model to the island of great britain ( gb ) , whose early inhabitants were known as britons , and spoke celtic languages @xcite . the earliest form of english was brought to the island by invading germanic - speaking settlers .",
    "this became _ anglo saxon _ ( or _ old english _ ) , as written by alfred , king of wessex ( 849 - 899 a.d . ) but would not be recognisable to modern speakers .",
    "it slowly changed , with external influences ( notably norman ) , into the english we know today @xcite .",
    "we seek to discover the extent to which the spatial distribution of dialect structures which have emerged in gb can be predicted by equation ( [ evo ] ) . to model the evolution of individual linguistic variables we take mainland gb as our spatial domain , and numerically solve equation ( [ evo ] ) on a grid of discrete points ( figure [ fig : evo ] ) , using an explicit euler scheme @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the solution is a randomly generated spatial frequency distribution where each grid point is assigned a randomly selected variant . by repeatedly generating initial conditions and solving the system , we can determine the most probable equilibrium spatial distributions of language use . the population density @xmath5",
    "is estimated using 2011 census data @xcite , which gives the number of inhabitants at each of the @xmath39 uk postcodes .",
    "a smooth density is then obtained from this by allowing the inhabitants to diffuse a short distance from the geographical centre of their postcode . despite significant overall population growth",
    ", the locations of major population centres in gb can trace their origins back through hundreds of years .",
    "since dialect evolution equation ( [ evo ] ) depends only on relative population densities , the current density distribution therefore serves as reasonable proxy for historical versions .",
    "we estimate that @xmath10 lies in the range @xmath40 based on that fact that the average distance travelled to work in gb in 2011 was 15 km @xcite , whereas the average distance travelled to secondary school was 5.5 km @xcite . in section [ analysis ]",
    "we find that the typical width of a transition region between linguistic variables is @xmath41 .",
    "for example , the transition between northern and southern dialects gb dialects is @xmath42 wide @xcite , which if @xmath43 , gives the approximation @xmath44 .",
    "when it comes to interpreting our results , the fact that usage frequencies are continuously varying through space presents a similar problem to that faced by dialectologists when trying to draw isoglosses .",
    "we resolve this by defining domain boundaries to be lines across which the _ modal _",
    "( most common ) variant changes .",
    "a domain is therefore a region throughout which a single variant is the most commonly used .",
    "we may think of domain boundaries as synthetic isoglosses generated by equation ( [ evo ] ) .        in figure",
    "[ fig : evo ] we show a series of snapshots of the evolution of domains when there are @xmath45 variants .",
    "isogloss evolution is driven by a two dimensional form of surface tension @xcite : in the absence of density variation , curved boundaries straighten out .",
    "figure [ fig : tension ] illustrates why this happens faster when curvature is greater . here",
    ", speaker l hears more of variant a so domain b will retract in this locality .",
    "speaker r hears more of variant b and so domain a will retract in this region .",
    "the net effect will be to straighten the boundary , reducing its length . if a boundary forms a closed curve then this length reduction effect can cause it to evolve toward a circular shape , and reduce in area , eventually disappearing altogether .",
    "however , this _ shrinking droplet _ effect can be arrested or reversed if the droplet surrounds a sufficiently dense population centre ( a city ) .",
    "in fact , population centres typically repel isoglosses in our model , and so have a tendency to create their own domains .",
    "an explanation of this effect is given in figure [ fig : repulsion ] .",
    "here we have a region of high population density in which linguistic variant b is dominant , surrounded by a low population density region where variant a is in common use .",
    "we consider the linguistic neighbourhood of a speaker located on the isogloss separating the two domains . from figure",
    "[ fig : repulsion ] we see that although the majority of the speaker s interaction range lies in region a , she has many more interactions with those in region b , and is therefore likely to adapt her speech toward variant b , causing the isogloss to shift outward into the low density area .        the most common form of stable isogloss generated by our model is a line , typically with some population density induced curvature , connecting two points on the boundary of the system . in order to be stable , such lines must emerge perpendicular from system boundaries , and as a result they are attracted to indentations in coastline , as illustrated in figure [ fig : coast ] . in this figure",
    "we consider two speakers located at the points where two possible isoglosses meet the coast ( or other system boundary - a country border , or a mountain range for example ) .",
    "speaker r , on the dashed isogloss , hears more of variant b because the isogloss is not perpendicular to the coast ; it will therefore migrate upward toward the apex of the coastal indentation until it reaches the stable form shown by the solid line .",
    "this effect can be seen in figure [ fig : evo ] , where the longest east - west isogloss has migrated so that it emerges from the largest indentation on the east coast of gb . in reality",
    "this indentation , called ` the wash ' , is the site of an _ isogloss bundle _ ( the coincidence of several isoglosses ) separating ` northern ' [ ] from ` southern ' [ ] @xcite .",
    "a similar bundle occurs at the largest indentation in the atlantic coast of france : the gironde estuary @xcite , separating the _ langue doc _ from the _ langue doil_. the fact that bundling at such locations is predicted by our model provides the first sign of the predictive power of the surface tension effect .    .",
    "]    having considered the evolution of a single linguistic variable , we now turn to modelling dialects .",
    "a dialect is typically defined by multiple linguistic characteristics , and we can capture this by combining many solutions to equation ( [ evo ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : iso ] we have superposed the synthetic isoglosses for twenty binary ( @xmath46 ) linguistic variables .     produced by 20 solutions of in the @xmath46 model with @xmath36 , each with different randomized initial conditions .",
    "for the left hand map @xmath47 km and for the right hand map @xmath48 km ( see supplementary video ) .",
    "background shading indicates population density with brightest orange corresponding to @xmath49 inhabitants per km@xmath50 . ]",
    "we see that there is a significant degree of _ bundling _ where many isoglosses follow similar routes across the system .",
    "given that the initial conditions for each variable are distinct random frequency distributions ( figure [ fig : evo ] ) , then these bundles represent highly probable isogloss positions : many different early spatial distributions lead to these at later stages of evolution .",
    "the key point here is that the final spatial structure of dialect domains is rather insensitive to the early history of the language : the effects of surface tension and population density draw many different isoglosses toward the same stable configurations . in this sense",
    "the surface tension effect is an ` invisible hand ' which , in the long term , can overpower historical population upheavals .",
    "however , we emphasise that our model predicts only the spatial structure of dialects and not their particular _ sound _ ; this is very much determined by quirks of history and the initial state of the system .",
    "figure [ fig : iso ] also illustrates the effect of human mobility on dialect structure . for a smaller interaction range ( 5 km ) , the structure of synthetic isogloss bundles is more complex , producing a larger number of distinct regions .",
    "this effect is well documented in studies of the historical evolution of dialects which were , in the past , more numerous and covered smaller geographical areas @xcite . within our model ,",
    "this is explained by the fact that fluctuations in population density only become relevant to isogloss evolution when they take place over a length scale which is comparable to the interaction range : two human settlements could only develop distinct dialects if they were separated by a distance significantly greater than @xmath10 , otherwise they would be in regular linguistic contact .",
    "km and @xmath36 at @xmath51 .",
    "levenshtein distance ( or ` edit distance ' ) @xcite used as distance metric .",
    "colours , determined by hungarian method , show mapping between dialect areas .",
    "black dotted line shows north - south isogloss . ]",
    "having analysed our model using isoglosses , we now make comparison to recent work in dialectometry , where dialect domains are determined by cluster analysis .",
    "a typical approach @xcite is to construct a data set giving the frequencies of a wide range of variant pronunciations at different locations , and then to cluster these locations according to the similarity of their aggregated sets of characteristics .",
    "we mimic this approach by constructing a synthetic data set from 20 solutions of equation ( [ evo ] ) with @xmath46 , and each with different random initial conditions , corresponding to different linguistic variables .",
    "we then randomly select a large number ( 6,000 ) of sample locations within gb and determine the modal variants for each of the 20 variables at each location .",
    "this aggregated data is then divided into @xmath52 clusters using the k - medoids algorithm @xcite ( available in the r language ) .",
    "the metric used for linguistic distance between sample points is the manhattan distance between the binary vectors where the two variants are labelled 1 or -1 .",
    "this is equivalent to the levenshtein distance used in dialectometry @xcite .",
    "we have found that almost identical results are obtained by applying ward s hierarchical clustering algorithm @xcite to the sample locations and subsequently cutting the tree into @xmath52 clusters .    in order to compare our cluster analysis to the work of dialectologists we consider a prediction for the future dialect areas of england ( excluding wales and scotland ) made by trudgill @xcite , shown in the left hand map of figures [ fig : clust ] and [ fig : voron ] .",
    "this prediction divides the country into 13 regions , and is the result of a systematic analysis of regional variation in speech and ongoing changes .",
    "such sharp divisions are a significant simplification of reality however , and hide many subtle smaller scale variations .",
    "the decision to define 13 regions therefore reflects a judgement on the range of language use which can be categorized as a single dialect . to allow comparison with this prediction",
    "we have performed a set of cluster analyses of near - equilibrium ( large @xmath17 ) solutions for the whole of gb , for a range of values of the number , @xmath52 , of clusters ( see figure [ fig : clusters ] ) , with the aim of producing 13 within the subset of gb defined by england .",
    "the closest result was 14 clusters for @xmath53 with almost identical results within england for each of these choices .",
    "having defined our synthetic dialect regions we apply the hungarian method @xcite to find the mapping between our synthetic dialects , and trudgill s predicted dialects , which maximizes the total area of overlap between the two .",
    "the results are show in figure [ fig : clust ] . to provide a measure of the effectiveness of our model in matching trudgill s predictions",
    "we also define a _ null _ model , which divides the country into regions at random , independent of population distribution and without reference to any model of speaker interaction .",
    "there are a number of models which generate random tessellations of space @xcite , many of which are motivated by physical processes such as fracture or crack propagation .",
    "we wish to exclude such physical assumption and so opt for the voronoi tessellation @xcite , based on the poisson point process : the simplest of all random spatial processes .",
    "our null model is then a voronoi tessellation of england ( figure [ fig : voron ] ) using 13 points selected uniformly at random from within its borders , with dialects labelled to most closely match trudgill s map , using the hungarian method .",
    ".[tab : sim ] metrics measuring the similarity between trudgill s predictions @xcite for future english dialects and the predictions of our model .",
    "metric acronyms are ol ( overlap ) , wol ( weighted overlap ) , ri ( rand index ) and ari ( adjusted rand index ) .",
    "the * voronoi example * column gives equivalent metrics for the example voronoi tessellation in figure [ fig : voron ] and the * voronoi set * column gives the mean metrics , with standard deviation , for five randomly generated vornoi tessellations . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     having generated a our synthetic dialect maps , we now quantify the extent to which they match the predictions of trudgill .",
    "we offer four alternative metrics of similarity in table [ tab : sim ] .",
    "the simplest metric is overlap ( ol ) : the percentage of land area which is identified as belonging to the same dialect as trudgill s prediction .",
    "the _ weighted overlap _ ( wol ) weights overlapping regions in proportion to their population density : it gives the probability that a randomly selected inhabitant will be assigned to the same dialect zone by both maps . from table 1",
    "we see that this probability is high @xmath54 for our model , but lower for the random voronoi model .",
    "we suggest that this is a result of the fact that population centres tend to _ repel _ isoglosses and therefore often lie at the centres of dialect domains .",
    "we will examine this repulsion effect in more detail below .",
    "the final two metrics are commonly used to compare clusterings , including by dialectometrists @xcite .",
    "consider a set , @xmath55 of elements ( spatial locations for us ) that has been partitioned into clusters ( dialect areas ) in two different ways .",
    "let us call these two partitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the rand index ( ri ) @xcite is defined as the probability that given two randomly selected elements of @xmath55 , the partitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 will agree in their answer to the question : are both elements in the same cluster ?",
    "a disadvantage with using this index to compare dialect maps is that the larger the number of regions in the maps , the more likely it is that two randomly selected spatial points will not lie in the same cluster in either map .",
    "the index therefore approaches 1 as the number of dialect areas grows .",

    "the bundle emerged from the tip of an indentation of the dutch - german speech area ( bordered to the east by slavic languages ) , and ran roughly east - west before separating approximately 40 km east of the river rhine , and fanning out around cities such as dusseldorf , cologne , koblenz and trier .",
    "this arrangement of isoglosses is known as the `` rhenish fan '' . in figure",
    "[ fig : fan ] we have constructed an artificial system with boundaries approximating the geographical structure of relevant parts of the dutch - german language area illustrated in bloomfield @xcite containing an artificial cluster of population centres representing the german cities located near to the rhine .",
    "the system was initialized using the same randomization procedure used for gb , and figure [ fig : fan ] shows a superposition ten solutions , each with different initial conditions . in the early stages of evolution ,",
    "very little pattern is discernible , but as time progresses the main indentation collects isoglosses , while the cities repel them , producing a fan - like structure .",
    "we therefore suggest that the isogloss separation which created the rhenish fan may have been the result of repulsion by the cities of the rhine .",

    "we next consider an example of what some physicists refer to as `` stripe states '' @xcite : in finite systems which experience phase ordering , and have aspect ratios greater than one , boundaries between two orderings often form across the system by the shortest route ( in a rectangle , joining two long sides ) .",
    "a collection of such boundaries form a striped pattern of phase orderings .",
    "figure [ fig : stripe ] illustrates this effect , produced by equation ( [ evo ] ) .",
    "our model therefore predicts such striped dialect patterns in long thin countries , and a particularly striking example of the effect may be seen in the dialects of the saami language @xcite .",

    "their arctic homeland forms a curved strip with a length which is approximately five times its average width .",

    "the relationship between geographical separation and linguistic distance ( often measured using levenshtein distances @xcite ) is typically sublinear @xcite .",
    "the definition of linguistic distance and its relation to geographic distance was made by sguy @xcite , and the relationship therefore goes by the name : `` sguy s curve '' @xcite .",

    "the system is initialized with a circular isogloss , centred on the city , representing a local linguistic innovation . because population density is a decreasing function of the distance from the city centre , speakers on the isogloss hear more of the innovation than their current speech form , allowing it to expand ( as explained in figure [ fig : repulsion ] ) .",

    "the two solutions @xmath233 and @xmath234 are respectively decreasing and increasing functions of @xmath235 .",
    "the stability of these solutions may be determined by noting that if @xmath236 then @xmath219 will expand , and contract if the inequality is reversed . from this",
    "we are able to determine that @xmath234 is stable , whereas @xmath233 is not . if a dialect domain begins with @xmath237 then it will shrink and disappear under the influence of surface tension , but if initially @xmath238 then the domain will expand or contract until @xmath239 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in figure [ fig : circ ] , where we see that our law ( [ law ] ) accurately predicts the stable radius produced by our evolution equation ( [ evo ] ) .",
    "departing from the existing approaches of dialectology , we have formulated a theory of how interactions between individual speakers control how dialect regions evolve .",
    "much of what we have demonstrated is a consequence of the similarity between dialect formation and the physical phenomenon of phase ordering .",
    "humans tend to set down roots , and to conform to local speech patterns .",
    "these local patterns may be viewed as analogous to local crystal orderings in binary alloys @xcite or magnetic domains @xcite . as with phase ordering , surface tension is a dominant process controlling the evolution of dialect regions . however , important differences arise from the fact that human populations are not evenly distributed through space , and the geographical regions in which they live have irregular shapes .",
    "these two effects cause many different randomized early linguistic conditions to evolve toward a much smaller number of stable final states . for great britain",
    "we have shown that an ensemble of these final states can produce predicted dialect areas which are in remarkable agreement with the work of dialectologists .",
    "since language change is inherently stochastic , at small spatial scales we can only expect predictions of a statistical nature . at larger scales",
    "an element of deterministic predictability emerges . within our model ,",
    "all stochasticity arises from the randomization of initial conditions .",
    "the effect of this randomness is strongest in the early stages of language evolution , when the typical size of dialect domains is small .",
    "the superposition of isoglosses lacks a discernible pattern .",
    "this `` tangle '' of lines produces a continuum of language variation , with spatial correlations given by sguy s curve . as",
    "surface tension takes hold , steered by variations in population density and system shape , isoglosses begin to bundle and the continuum resolves into distinct dialect regions .",
    "both long term population stability , and large variations population density play an important role . without these ingredients",
    "isoglosses will not have time to evolve into smooth lines , or bundle .",
    "our model therefore predicts that dialect continua ( rather than sharply bounded dialect regions ) might be observed more frequently in regions with relatively even population density , frequent movement of people , or high levels of linguistic innovation ( creating new variants ) .",
    "the assumptions of our model are minimal , and it is clear that there are many additional complexities involved in language change which we have not captured ; we discuss below how the model might be extended to account for some of these . despite this simplicity , in addition to substantially reproducing trudgill s predictions for english dialects",
    "@xcite we have also been able explain a number of other effects : we can explain the observation by dialectologists of both dialect continua and more sharply bounded dialect domains .",
    "we have provided an explanation for why boundary indentations ( in coastline or in the border between two countries or regions speaking different languages ) are likely to collect isoglosses @xcite .",
    "we have shown that cities repel isoglosses , explaining the origin of the rhenish fan @xcite , the wave like spread of city language features @xcite and the fact that many dialect patterns are centred on large urban areas .",
    "we have explained why linguistic regions with high aspect ratio tend to develop striped dialect regions @xcite .",
    "we have computed an analytical form for sguy s curve @xcite which as yet has had no theoretical derivation .",
    "we have also adapted this derivation to deal with a population centre .",
    "we have quantified how the width of a transition region @xcite between dialects is related to the strength of conformity in individual language use , and the typical geographical distances over which individuals interact .",
    "we have shown how to relate the curvature of stable isoglosses to population gradients .",
    "finally , in appendix [ age ] we show how incorporating an age distribution into the model can quantify the `` apparent time '' @xcite effect used by dialectologists to detect a linguistic change in progress . given these findings",
    ", we suggest that the theoretical approach we have present would be worth further investigation , and we now suggest some directions that such investigation might take .",
    "an important aspect of language change which is not explicitly encoded within our model is _ innovation _ : the creation of new forms of speech .",
    "we have instead assumed that there are a finite set of possible linguistic variables , and for each one , a finite set of alternatives , all of which are present in varying frequencies within the initial conditions of the model .",
    "each of these alternatives is equally attractive or prestigious , so that the local fate of a given variable is decided by conformity alone .",
    "because of this , a new variant can not spontaneously emerge within the domain of another .",
    "the model therefore evolves towards states of increasing order and spatial correlation . due to",
    "the presence of population centres this ordering process is eventually arrested creating distinct , stable domains .",
    "if innovation were allowed within the model , then ordering would be interrupted by the initialisation of new features , and we would expect sguy s curve to reach a steady state where the rate of innovation ( creating spatial disorder ) balanced the rate of ordering . in order for a local innovation to take hold , it would need to overcome local conformity , realized as surface tension and the `` shrinking droplet '' effect , requiring some innate prestige relative to existing features .",
    "we now consider our assumptions about human mobility and interactions . by selecting a gaussian interaction kernel , and not distinguishing between different social groups",
    ", we are assuming that the social network through which language change is transmitted is only _ locally _ connected in a geographical sense but within each locality the social network is fully connected .",
    "that is , i will listen without prejudice to anyone regardless of age , sex , status or ethnicity , as long as they live near my home .",
    "experimental research into typical human mobility in the 21st century @xcite and the work of linguists @xcite , indicates that both these assumptions are a simplification of reality .",
    "it appears that human mobility patterns , and by implication interaction kernels , exhibit heavy tailed behaviour ( with an exponential cut ",
    "off at large distances ) . in our framework",
    "an interaction kernel of this type , combined with densely populated cities would allow significant long range connectivity between population centres .",
    "long range interactions in phase ordering phenomena can have significant effects on spatial correlations and typical sizes of domains @xcite , and may effectively alter the spatial dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "in addition to exhibiting long range interactions , mobility data @xcite also shows that individuals follow regular , repeating trajectories , introducing strong heterogeneity within the set of individual interaction kernels .",
    "we note however , that long range interactions may be less relevant to the historical evolution of language , when human mobility was more limited .",
    "social , as well as spatial heterogeneity may also be important to the behaviour of the system .",
    "for example , it has been shown theoretically @xcite that when a population consists of more than one social group , then the time required to reach linguistic consensus is highly sensitive to the level of affinity that individuals for their own group .",
    "we conclude by noting that a major theme of the book _ war and peace _ by leo tolstoy , is the idea that history is determined not by _ great individuals _ but rather by millions of small choices made by the masses .",
    "_ `` to elicit the laws of history we must leave aside kings , ministers , and generals , and select for study the homogeneous , infinitesimal elements which influence the masses . '' _ @xcite    as pointed out by vitny @xcite , tolstoy was , in modern terms , advocating the formulation of a statistical mechanics of history .",
    "the work we have presented is an attempt to formulate such a theory for the spatial history of language .",
    "because of its simplicity , dealing only with copying and movement , our model may apply more broadly to other forms of culture .",
    "in order to experimentally detect a linguistic change in progress , ideally one would like to survey the same population of individuals , or a representative sample of the population , at two or more points in time @xcite .",
    "such longitudinal studies may be practically difficult to carry out , so linguists have made use of the assumption that speech patterns are acquired mainly in the early part of people s lives .",
    "the speech of a 50-year old today should therefore reflect the speech of a 30-year old twenty years ago .",
    "it should be noted though , that speech patterns can change throughout life @xcite , although more slowly in older speakers . a linguistic change detected by observing different speech patterns in the young and old",
    "is said to have been observed in _ apparent time _ @xcite .",
    "a famous example of apparent time is the replacement of the term _ chesterfield _ ( meaning an upholstered multiple - person seat ) in canadian speech , with the fashionable american term _",
    "couch _ @xcite . in this case",
    "the use of _ couch _ was shown to decrease sigmoidally from @xmath240 amongst teenagers to @xmath241 among those in their eighties .",
    "the apparent time theory has been tested by comparing language surveys taken at different times , and comparing predictions based on apparent time in the earlier sample , with the observations made in the later one @xcite .",
    "we note that differences between speech patterns between the generations do not always indicate a linguistic change in progress @xcite .",
    "for example , the use of some speech forms may change systematically with age in the same way , generation after generation , so that the community as a whole is in a stable state @xcite .",
    "we now give a simple illustration of how age and apparent time can be incorporated in our model .",
    "for simplicity we consider the progress of a straight isogloss between two variants , driven by a slowly declining population density .",
    "this density variation is equivalent to a social bias toward one variable which we call the _ new variant_. we let @xmath242 be the frequency with which the new ( spreading ) variable is used at position @xmath199 and time @xmath17 . note that there is no @xmath184 dependence due to symmetry . to distinguish between young and old",
    "we introduce an age density distribution @xmath243 giving the fraction of individuals within the age bracket @xmath244 $ ] as @xmath245 using this distribution we modify our original model to account for the fact that individuals have been exposed only to the linguistic information available in their lifetime .",

    "we also take the limit of total conformity @xmath34 so that language is chosen according to a simple majority rule .",
    "we consider an exponentially decaying population density @xmath251 where @xmath252 .",
    "the weighted interaction kernel for this density is then @xmath253 notice that the effect of the decaying population density is to shift the interaction kernel to the left so that more attention is paid to language use on that side of the listener . to compute the isogloss velocity we define @xmath254 and prepare the system with initial condition @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the initial location of the isogloss .",
    "because each speaker listens more to the speakers on her left , the isogloss will travel right . in the limit @xmath34",
    "then when the memory , @xmath257 , of a speaker , with @xmath258 , reaches @xmath259 they will switch linguistic variables .",

    "we conclude by noting that this extension of the model to include different memory lengths should be seen as a `` toy '' model of the effect of age on language change .",
    "the fact that older speakers tend to take longer to change their language use is captured purely by the length of their memories . in reality the influence on a given speaker of the language she is exposed to at different stages of her life will be much more complicated than our simple model @xcite .",
    "for example , if language use were determined entirely during early life then the _ forgetting curve _ should be peaked during these early years - in effect the linguistic memory should stop `` recording '' once a speaker s youth has ended . each speaker will respond differently to what they hear , so the forgetting curve will not be identical for every speaker .",
