    "type ii superconductors @xcite allow for a partial penetration of magnetic field into the bulk of the superconducting ( sc ) material when the applied field @xmath4 satisfies @xmath5 . in a seminal work abrikosov @xcite",
    "showed that when the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetic field penetration depth and @xmath8 is the coherence length , is greater than @xmath9 the magnetic field penetrates the sc material in the form of flux - lines ( fls ) .",
    "these fls are also called vortices , since they are surrounded by circular currents .",
    "each fl carries a quantized unit of flux @xmath10 called the fluxoid .",
    "the fls have cylindrical shape of radius @xmath11 ( the radius is not sharp since the magnetic field decays exponentially like @xmath12 , where r is the distance from the axis ) and a non - sc core of radius @xmath13 .",
    "due to a repulsive interaction among the fls , they arrange themselves in a triangular lattice referred to as the vortex solid ( vs ) .",
    "this result follows from mean - field theory .",
    "after high - temperature superconductors were discovered in the 1980 s , it became apparent that thermal fluctuations , not included in the mean - field theory @xcite , play an important role at relatively high temperatures and fields , still below @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these fluctuations can cause the abrikosov lattice to melt into a disordered liquid via a first order transition ( fot ) , which can be roughly estimated using the lindemann criterion known from solid state physics @xcite .",
    "technologically , the melting of the fl lattice is important since the vortex liquid ( vl ) is not actually sc due to the dissipation caused by the fl motion when an electric current passes through the system .",
    "pinning of fls by naturally occurring defects in the form of vacancies , interstitials , twin and grain boundaries etc .",
    ", is effective to impede fl motion in the vs phase , where the fls form a rigid correlated network .",
    "the effectiveness of the pinning manifests itself by leading to high critical currents . in the vl phase pinning of a few vortices",
    "does not inhibit others from moving when a current is applied .",
    "thus for practical purposes the sudden increase in resistivity occurs at the melting transition rather than when @xmath16 for any reasonably non - vanishing currents .",
    "the existence of the melting transition in high-@xmath14 pristine materials has been established through numerous experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite studies . as was mentioned above , disorder in the form of points defects and sometimes more extended defects can and",
    "does occur naturally in laboratory samples .",
    "in addition artificial point defects can be induced by bombarding the sample with electrons originating from particle accelerators .",
    "extended columnar defects in the form of linear damaged tracks piercing through the sample can be induced by heavy ion irradiation .",
    "both naturally occurring and artificially induced defects are situated at random positions in the sample and their effective pinning strength ( i.e. their interaction with fls ) can also vary from defect to defect .",
    "thus defects play the role of quenched disorder .",
    "the adjective `` quenched '' refers to the immobility of these defects during experimental time scales .",
    "introduction of disorder in terms of point defects or columnar pins affects both the properties of the solid and liquid phases and might also shift the location of the melting transition in the h - t plane @xcite . in the case of point pins ,",
    "the vs phase is replaced with a bragg glass phase @xcite , characterized by quasi - long - range order .",
    "the melting transition is predicted to shift towards lower temperatures @xcite . in the case of columnar pins",
    "the vs phase is replaced with a so called pinned bose glass @xcite where fls are trapped by the columnar defects and the whole lattice becomes immobile .",
    "the bose glass phase is similar to the localized phase of a two dimensional repulsive bose gas in the presence of quenched disorder , as will be explained in more detail in the next section .",
    "the effect of both kinds of disorders on the fls melting has been studied experimentally in various high - temperature superconductors .",
    "two common materials that have been extensively investigated are yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( bscco ) , both having critical temperatures ranging between 90 - 120 k at @xmath17 .",
    "the main difference between these materials is their anisotropy parameter @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the effective masses of electrons moving along the @xmath21-axis and the @xmath22-plane respectively .",
    "bscco is much more anisotropic : its anisotropy parameter @xmath23 lies in the range of 50 - 200 compared to the range of 5 - 7 for ybco @xcite .",
    "this fact causes the fls to be much `` softer '' or elastic .",
    "thus in the case of bscco the fls are sometimes described as a collection of loosely connected `` pancakes '' residing in adjacent cu - o planes .",
    "experimental studies on ybco have shown a marked shift in the irreversibility line in the presence of the columnar disorder @xcite .",
    "the irreversibility line in the h - t plane marks the onset of hysteresis effects and is located close to the melting transition on the solid phase side . for bscco , many experimental studies have been conducted @xcite .",
    "the more recent ones have shown @xcite that the melting line is not shifted when the density of columnar defects is relatively low , @xmath24 , but for @xmath25 a shift in the position of the melting transition is observed . here",
    "the matching field @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density of the columnar defects and @xmath29 is the flux quantum .",
    "theoretical work on columnar disorder includes bose glass theory @xcite .",
    "radzihovsky @xcite considered the possibility of two kinds of bose glass phases ( strongly or weakly pinned ) depending on whether @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "more recently , columnar as well as point disorder were investigated by goldschmidt @xcite using replica field theory .",
    "he showed that the melting line shifts to lower temperature in the case of point disorder and to higher temperature in the case of columnar disorder .    due to the complexity of the problem , especially in the presence of disorder",
    ", simulations have been very useful in studying the fl system .",
    "there have been many simulation studies of the vortex system in the presence of disorder .",
    "however , most simulation work has been confined to the addition of point disorder only . in particular , there is little work done on the effects of columnar disorder on the fl melting .",
    "recent work by wengel and tuber @xcite concentrated on the case of high defect density region @xmath32 .",
    "in contrast , a recent simulation study by sen _ et al . _ @xcite uses a small density of columnar defects , each of infinite strength , but considers an extremely small magnetic field .",
    "similarly , nandgaonkar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also investigate the case of a very small magnetic field . in this paper",
    "we consider columnar defects of a finite strength ( @xmath33 ) with a relatively low defect density , @xmath34 , and with realistic magnetic fields as used in the experiments .",
    "we first discuss the method implemented for ybco :    following nelson @xcite , we map the system of @xmath35 vortices ( fls ) in a high-@xmath14 superconductor onto @xmath35 interacting bosons in 2-space + 1-time dimensions",
    ". then we do a path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation on this system .",
    "the partition function of @xmath35 vortices can be expressed as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the 2d position vector of the ith vortex at a height @xmath38 along the @xmath21-axis , @xmath39 is the free energy as a function of temperature @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the length of the sample along the @xmath38-direction .",
    "the london free - energy functional @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 is the vortex line energy per unit length , the line tension is @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here @xmath48 is the lattice spacing , @xmath49 is the magnetic field along the @xmath38-direction and @xmath23 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "@xmath50 is the in - plane interaction potential between two fls a distance @xmath51 apart .",
    "@xmath52 denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "this expression for the london free - energy is an approximation that neglects the non - local interaction of real vortices and replaces it by in - plane interactions only , which is really justified if the fls do not deviate too much from straight lines along the @xmath38-axis @xcite . with this approximation ,",
    "the system of @xmath35 interacting fls is equivalent to a system of @xmath35 bosons in @xmath53 dimension interacting with a pairwise potential @xmath50 .",
    "the path integral representation of a system of @xmath35 bosons of mass @xmath54 each in two dimensions , interacting through a potential @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being the strength and @xmath7 being the range of the repulsive interaction , is given at finite temperature @xmath57 in terms of the imaginary time action @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the imaginary time and @xmath57 is the temperature of the bose system .",
    "we see that there is a one to one parameter mapping between the boson system and the vortex system @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average density of bosons ( and fls ) and @xmath62 is the area of the sample .",
    "we can write the london free - energy functional in a dimensionless form as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath64 all lengths are measured in units of @xmath65 and energies in units of @xmath66 for bosons and @xmath67 for fls .",
    "we next discretize the integral along the @xmath38-axis by dividing it into @xmath68 segments : @xmath69/kt}\\label{xi}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , @xmath54 labels the planes and @xmath71}{kt}=\\sum _ { i , m } \\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{r}_{i , m+1}-\\mathbf{r}_{i , m}\\right)^{2 } } { 2\\lambda^{2}\\tau } + \\sum _ { i < j}\\tau k_{0}\\left(r_{ij , m}/\\tilde{\\lambda } \\right).\\ ] ]    we work only in the limit where @xmath72 is large , which amounts to taking @xmath41 very large and in the mapping onto @xmath73 bosons corresponds to the ground state of the bosons at the absolute zero temperature ( @xmath74 )",
    ". we used @xmath75 and discretized the @xmath38-axis into @xmath76 planes .",
    "we used the matrix - squaring method @xcite to calculate the right action so that we can work with a small number of planes along the @xmath38-direction . working with the primitive action",
    "requires the use of a large number of slicing of the @xmath38-direction and is very time consuming @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions in the @xmath38-direction for a system of bosons are @xmath77 , with all permutations @xmath78 of the indices being allowed .",
    "this is what is meant by the summation over @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) . for small @xmath56 ( a small repulsive interaction ) , which corresponds to large @xmath80",
    ", we expect a bose - einstein condensed phase where permutations are important .",
    "this is the superfluid phase . for small @xmath80 ,",
    "repulsion is large and permutations are rare as the bose system is in its classical phase which is a wigner crystal .",
    "these two phases correspond respectively to the fl liquid and solid phases .",
    "the melting line represented by @xmath81 is given approximately by the expression @xmath82 .",
    "near @xmath83 this behavior is more complicated ( see below ) .",
    "we now discuss the method of simulations of bscco :    because of the high anisotropy of the bscco system one can not use the simple picture given above . here , instead , we follow a different model which can be cast in a form analogous to ybco .",
    "we take the lawrence - doniach model @xcite as our starting point for bscco .",
    "it leads to the following form of the london free - energy for inter - layer ( il ) josephson coupling @xcite : @xmath84 , \\label{quadjos}\\ ] ] for @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , \\label{linjos}\\ ] ] for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the inter - layer spacing and @xmath89 is the healing length defined by @xmath90 . for the in - plane ( ip ) coupling we use : @xmath91 in principle one should add to the above interaction an electromagnetic interaction among the pancake vortices @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction becomes dominant in the limit of infinite anisotropy ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "@xcite argue , ( see also ref . ) that for the value @xmath93 for bscco the josephson coupling still dominates by one order of magnitude over the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "their argument goes as follows : clem @xcite shows that if one has a straight array of pancake vortices along the @xmath38-axis , and one pancake is displaced a distance @xmath94 in the @xmath95-direction than the magnetic energy of the configuration increases by an amount @xmath96 where @xmath97 is euler s constant ( = 0.5772 ... ) . for large @xmath94 ( @xmath98 ) ,",
    "the modified bessel function @xmath99 decays exponentially and thus the energy increases like @xmath100 . for small @xmath94 the bessel function",
    "can be expanded in a power series in @xmath101 @xmath102 and thus the magnetic energy behaves like @xmath103 to leading order in @xmath94 which is the same as the quadratic behavior of the josephson energy in eq .",
    "( [ quadjos ] ) above .",
    "the ratio of the coefficients of the quadratic terms in the magnetic and josephson energies goes roughly like @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 for bscco ) .",
    "thus for anisotropy @xmath93 we get a factor of 0.25 ( a somewhat more precise estimate @xcite gives a ratio of about 0.1 ) .",
    "thus the magnetic interaction is negligible compared to the josephson interaction for @xmath93 . for samples with @xmath106 these interactions are already comparable . for large values of @xmath94",
    "the magnetic interaction increases logarithmically and the josephson interaction increases linearly so the magnetic interaction is always negligible .",
    "the key to the estimate given above is to consider not just two pancake vortices but a whole line with one displaced pancake .",
    "this argument is valid if the deviations of the vortices from straight lines are not too large . as for the in - plane interaction clem showed that a linear array of pancake vortices gives rise to exactly the same magnetic field at a distance @xmath94 away from it as produced by an abrikosov vortex line .",
    "( [ logjos ] ) is consistent with the magnetic interaction of pancake vortices , again when the fls do not deviate too much from straight lines .",
    "equations ( [ quadjos])-([logjos ] ) for bscco can be cast in a form similar to that for the ybco with the following substitutions : @xmath107    with these changes the london free - energy functional would look like@xmath108,\\ ] ] for @xmath109 , and @xmath110- \\frac{(2r_{g}-(|\\mathbf{r}_{i , m}-\\mathbf{r}_{i , m+1}|))^{2 } } { 2\\lambda ^{2}\\tau } , \\label{second}\\ ] ] for @xmath111 , when now again all lengths are measured in units of @xmath65 . while doing simulations at a fixed magnetic field @xmath49 and temperature @xmath40 , the term @xmath112 will remain constant and would drop out of @xmath113 term in the boltzmann factor .",
    "it however needs be considered during the measurement of the energy .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ second ] ) can be easily handled at the last stage of the bisection method ( see the next section for a discussion of the bisection method ) .",
    "we can make use of a reduced temperature variable to make some expressions look simpler .",
    "first , using the fact that the temperature dependence of @xmath114 arises mainly through @xmath115 and neglecting the logarithmic corrections , one gets @xcite",
    "@xmath116    and hence@xmath117 defining reduced temperature as : @xmath118 we obtain@xmath119 this shows that the equation for the melting line is approximately@xmath120 note that some authors @xcite use a temperature dependence of @xmath121 in @xmath7 , or even @xcite @xmath122 .",
    "all these choices coincide near @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of temperature dependence of @xmath7 is not expected to have a significant effect on the results .",
    "the technique that we use to simulate our system is called multilevel monte carlo simulation ( mmc ) @xcite .",
    "there are several advantages in using this technique for the simulation of the fls over the usual metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) method . in the discrete model , we work with @xmath35 fls with the @xmath38-axis discretized into @xmath68 planes , thus resulting in @xmath35 beads in each of the @xmath68 planes . in the usual mc method",
    "one would displace a few of these beads in a plane by small random displacements inside a two dimensional box and then would accept or reject the move based on a probability given by the boltzmann factor .",
    "a big disadvantage of using this technique is that it is difficult to move beads appreciably from their original positions over a number of mc steps .",
    "the reason for this is that a bead in a plane belonging to a fl finds itself in a local harmonic potential generated by the kinetic energy term involving this bead and the beads belonging to the same fl on either side of the plane .",
    "this harmonic potential becomes stronger and stronger at lower temperatures and magnetic fields . as a result , in the usual mc simulations beads",
    "keep moving around inside these local harmonic cages and end up sampling only a small part of the phase space .",
    "the other problem with the usual mc method is that there is no natural easy way of implementing fl cutting . if there are two fls twisted around each other and if it is energetically favorable for them to reconnect each other in such a way as to lower their free energy then this step should be permitted in the mc method without regard to the question if this process occurs in reality .",
    "this is so because in the mc simulations phase space is sampled according to the probability distribution and all one needs is to generate configurations weighted by the boltzmann factor , and the path followed in configuration space has nothing to do with any real dynamics .",
    "these two main drawbacks of the usual mc method are easily overcome in the mmc technique .",
    "first , one moves bigger chunks of fls encompassing beads in several planes .",
    "this way one can avoid local harmonic traps .",
    "( this is like taking an aerial route to a destination rather than going through the zigzag maze of roads . )",
    "this is much in the spirit of fourier space monte carlo where one first samples modes with smaller wave numbers and then move onto higher modes .",
    "the method of creating new fl configurations is based on the concept of the conditional probabilities .",
    "it is called the bisection method @xcite because one starts sampling beads by iteratively bisecting the fls . at each stage of the division ,",
    "the beads belonging to that stage are moved with some conditional probability factor @xmath123 .",
    "it is important to make sure that the probabilities are chosen in such a way that detailed balance is satisfied at each stage of the division .",
    "one notes that the @xmath123 s may not be the actual boltzmann factors for the beads to be moved at different levels .",
    "but what is required is that when all @xmath123 s are multiplied together , they cancel in such a way so as to leave the correct boltzmann factor for the whole move .",
    "thus , inherent in this algorithm is the fact that a move would finally be accepted only if it has been accepted at each stage of the bisection method .",
    "the power of this method lies in choosing the appropriate @xmath123 s .",
    "if these conditional probability factors are chosen judiciously , most of the rejections would take place at the initial stages of the bisection process when not too much computational effort has been spent yet .",
    "the cutting and reconnection of fls is implemented naturally in a mmc method : permutation among the 3 or 4 lines chosen to be moved becomes the first among the many hierarchical steps one goes through before a move is finally accepted and the position of the beads updated accordingly .",
    "we typically moved a total of 15 to 20 beads distributed over 5 planes .",
    "permutations were sampled by a random walk algorithm through the space of permutations @xcite(see appendix b ) .",
    "in the case of ybco we worked with a field of @xmath124 g. working in the primitive approximation of the action would require the use of a smaller value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 , which would require slicing of the @xmath38-direction into a large number of planes . to avoid this ,",
    "the matrix - squaring method @xcite has been used to get the effective action for bigger values of @xmath59 .",
    "for example nordborg and blatter @xcite use a value of @xmath125 and they work with 100 planes . in this simulation",
    "a value of @xmath126 has been used and the @xmath38-axis has been sliced into 75 planes . choosing a bigger value of @xmath127 by utilizing the matrix - squaring method makes it easier to equilibrate the system as compared to working with the primitive approximation .    for bscco",
    ", we did not use the matrix - squaring method because of the complications involved due to the few extra terms in free energy which contribute depending on whether @xmath51 is smaller or bigger than @xmath128 . here",
    ", we used the natural inter - layer spacing @xmath88 to calculate the parameter @xmath127 at different temperatures and then used the mmc technique to efficiently sample the configurational space .    as mentioned previously , in the present simulations we included only the josephson coupling .",
    "this approximation works well with ybco but it could be less satisfactory for bscco because of its high anisotropy . for very anisotropic materials",
    "the electromagnetic coupling becomes important @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , ryu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite estimated that for anisotropy of magnitude @xmath93 the josephson interaction still dominates over the electromagnetic interaction by an order of magnitude , but this will not be the case for @xmath106 which can characterize some samples .",
    "@xcite discuss how to include the electromagnetic interaction in a mc simulation , but they only consider the opposite limit where the josephson coupling is totally neglected . to our knowledge there is no satisfactory treatment of both couplings included on equal footings .",
    "we carried out preliminary simulations which show that the inclusion of the electromagnetic coupling does not shift the position of the transition line much at a field of @xmath129 g , thus supporting our current conclusions .",
    "these results will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "simulations were usually carried out for @xmath130 and @xmath131 fls .",
    "the decay of the structure factors at the transition temperature becomes sharper when one uses a larger number of fls .",
    "however , no appreciable shift in the transition temperature is seen while working with the smaller ( @xmath132 ) or the larger system ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "we did not run our simulations for even larger systems as it becomes computationally very time consuming .",
    "typical simulation times were @xmath134 mc steps .",
    "each mc step involved moving 3 - 4 lines in 5 planes simultaneously .",
    "we usually averaged over 10 - 15 realizations of the columnar disorders , though some results have an average over as many as 20 realizations of the disorder .",
    "columnar disorder is modeled as an array of straight cylindrical wells of typical radius @xmath135=25 - 35 placed randomly throughout the cross - sectional region of the sample and oriented along the @xmath38-direction @xcite .",
    "each columnar defect is of length @xmath136 .",
    "the density of the columnar pins can be varied by changing their number for a given cross sectional area , and the strength is controlled by a positive dimensionless parameter @xmath137 .",
    "if a bead happens to wander inside a columnar well , we include an extra free energy of @xmath138 .",
    "the defect concentration was taken to be a 20 percent ratio of defects to fls which means @xmath139 .",
    "the strength of disorder was set at @xmath140 for bscco .",
    "for ybco , @xmath141 was found to be too large in the sense that the transition became too broad and useful information could not be extracted .",
    "thus , for ybco we kept @xmath142 .",
    "other parameters used for ybco are @xmath143 @xmath144  , @xmath145  , @xmath146  .",

    ", this quantity too has a large value in an ordered phase and saturates at a finite value for a system of finite size .",
    "as we allow permutations of fls , we can define a number @xmath180 as that fraction of the total number of fls which belong to loops that are bigger than the size of a `` simple '' loop .",
    "a simple loop is defined as a set of @xmath68 beads connected end to end , @xmath68 being the total number of planes .",
    "loops of size @xmath181 , @xmath182 ... start proliferating at and above the transition temperature and in the corresponding 2d boson system this proliferation is related to the onset of the superfluidity .",

    "undergoes a large increase for large @xmath38 .",
    "we want to emphasize one important aspect of measuring the translational structure factor .",
    "the usual way of measuring this quantity is by choosing @xmath186 corresponding to the first bragg peak i.e. , @xmath187 in eq .",
    "( [ struc ] ) .",
    "now , it might happen that the configuration of the fls comes close to making an almost perfect hexagonal lattice but its basis vectors are not aligned along the usual major axes of the rhombically shaped cell encompassing the system .",
    "if we use the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath188 to measure the structure factor of such a configuration , we would end up getting a very small value for @xmath173 and might wrongly conclude that the system is in a very disordered state .",

    "to remedy this situation the translational structure factor is measured at 60 different angles , 1 degree apart , and choose that number which gives the largest possible value of the @xmath189 corresponding to some angle @xmath190 . after implementing this technique",

    "this result is in agreement with ref . where even with the introduction of the columnar disorder no shift in transition temperatures is seen as long as the concentration of columnar disorder introduced is small .",
    "it is found that for ybco as well as bscco , the melting transition shifts towards higher values of temperature and magnetic field when random disorder is introduced provided its strength exceeds a threshold which is different for ybco and bscco .",

    "these results are in tune with numerous experimental findings @xcite as well as theoretical prediction @xcite where the irreversibility line is seen to shift towards higher temperature and magnetic fields in the presence of columnar defects .",
    "the qualitative reason for this effect is that due to the interaction with the columnar defects the transverse thermal fluctuations of the fls are reduced and thus the melting transition , as determined from the lindemann criterion , takes place at at a higher temperature .    at @xmath141",
    "the jump in energy is not discernible any more . instead , a change of slope corresponding to a specific heat discontinuity is observed .",
    "this means that the transition is probably not of first order in the presence of columnar disorder of higher strengths , but it is rather a continuous ( second order ) transition .",
    "the most dramatic outcome of this study for bscco is that for some values of the applied field and defect strength both the translational and hexatic structure factors start to rise at a certain temperature as the transition is approached from the lower temperature side .",
    "this is an unusual result , that to our knowledge , has not been seen in previous simulations .",
    "this fact can be explained as follows . at low temperatures ,",
    "the free energy is dominated by energy effects rather than entropy considerations , and pinning effects are dominant . as a result",
    "most columnar defects capture a fl , while the rest of the fls adjust themselves in positions such as to minimize the free energy .",
    "however , as the temperature is increased , fls start to decouple from the defect sites , which allow the vortices pinned at interstitial positions to move themselves into a more ordered arrangement , thus increasing the structure factors compared to the situation at lower temperatures . as was mentioned before , due to its high anisotropy , fls in bscco behave more like a collection of two dimensional pancakes rather than rigid rods .",
    "these pancakes are comparatively more difficult to get pinned all at once by a columnar defect . on the other hand ,",
    "fls are much stiffer in ybco and it is easier for a columnar defect to capture a fl all along its length .",
    "it can be shown ( eq .",
    "( 9.49 ) in ref . )",
    "that the depinning temperature for fls , @xmath241 , is inversely proportional to the anisotropy parameter @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we expect fl depinning to occur at comparatively smaller temperatures in bscco than in ybco . since the melting temperatures are not that different between these materials at the fields we consider , the depinning process for bscco occurs further below the melting temperature than in ybco .",
    "this allows the structure factor to increase above the depinning temperature before its ultimate decline at the melting transition .",
    "for ybco , the depinning takes place close to the melting temperature , and it is difficult to detect any rise in the structure factors , especially for small systems , because it is masked by the decrease in order due to the stronger thermal fluctuations .    in principle , the rise of the order parameters in the presence of low amount of columnar defects as the melting transition temperature is approached could be observed experimentally , if the appropriate parameters are tuned correctly . in small angle neutron scattering ( sans )",
    "@xcite one can measure the integrated intensity over a bragg peak of wave vector @xmath242 which is proportional to the translational structure factor @xmath243 measured in the simulation .",
    "another commonly used technique is muon spin rotation @xcite which gives information about the width of the magnetic field distribution in the sample .",

    "it is possible to measure this quantity in the simulations but this was not done it in the present work .",
    "this quantity might not show the unusual rise describe above since it is dominated by @xmath246 which is very likely monotonically increasing with temperature yilding a monotonically decreasing line width .",
    "thus in order to look for the effect observed in this paper we suggest using the sans technique to look at a bscco sample with columnar pins described by a matching field of about 25 g and an applied field of about 125 g. it is not clear to us what is the corresponding @xmath33 parameter describing the pinning strength of the experimental defects . according to blatter _",

    "essentially the same method is used for permutation sampling as was used in ref . .",
    "the only difference is that we use permutation space of only the neighboring lines .",
    "this is so because even if we were able to get a permutation step , involving a large number of lines , accepted at the first stage of the algorithm , it would be very likely to get rejected at the following stages .",
    "so we work with only 3 - 5 lines .",
    "sufficiently long segments ( typically 5 planes ) of a number of lines were cut .",
    "care should be taken to make sure that chosen fls are the nearest neighbors in the plane where the reconnection of fls is going to take place .",
    "these points can be implemented easily with the concept of linked lists and pointers @xcite . also , care is to be taken that even though a fl may be far away from some other fl in the rhombically shaped unit cell , it can still permute with it through one of the images of the latter .",
    "these few simple points are very important to implement the whole procedure correctly . just for a check , we tried with the sampling procedure given in ref . .",
