    "the supernova remnant kes73 is a limb - brightened , shell - type radio remnant @xmath6 in diameter , located along the galactic plane ( g27.4 + 0.0 ) .",
    "the x - ray remnant is comparable in size to the bright radio shell , but is dominated by localized emission knots , interpreted as clumpy , diffuse emission in the interior , possibly due to fluorescence from reverse shock ( helfand et al .",
    "1994 using rosat hri images ) .",
    "centered on the remnant is the unresolved compact x - ray source , 1e1841@xmath0045 , discovered with the einstein observatory ( kriss et al .",
    "like the supernova remnants rcw 103 and ctb 109 , the radio observations show no evidence for a plerionic component or a localized radio counterpart to , with a flux limit @xmath7 mjy ( kriss et al .",
    "an hi absorption - based distance determination shows that kes73 lies @xmath8 kpc away ( sanbonmatsu & helfand 1992 ) .",
    "the nature of kes73 and in particular , its compact source , has been considered extensively in two earlier studies .",
    "kriss et al .",
    "( 1985 ) were unable to distinguish between thermal and non - thermal emission from ; they suggested as the origin of the emission either a hot thermal neutron star ( ns ) , a crab - like pulsar , a plerionic nebula , or an accretion powered binary . a more recent study by helfand et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reconsidered these possibilities using deep rosat hri pointings .",
    "they inferred a hard spectral component for , placed a limit on its long term variability of a factor of two change in flux , and suggested an accreting binary origin for the central source .    in this _",
    ", we use the broad - band asca x - ray observations of kes73 to further clarify its nature .",
    "we present a novel technique for isolating the background subtracted spectrum of the central source .",
    "we show that the spectrum of  is represented by a steep power law , possibly of non - thermal origin , and suggest that kes73 is a young ( @xmath5 yrs ) type ii / ib snr , the product of a massive progenitor . in our companion paper ( vasisht & gotthelf , referred herein as gv97 ) we report our discovery of a 11.8 s periodicity from , likely from an anomalous pulsar , the stellar remnant of the supernova explosion .",
    "the date and typing of kes 73 are critical to understand the nature of the pulsar .",
    "we present kes73 as another member of an emerging class of young thermal remnants which are found to contain a radio - quiet , hard x - ray point source .",
    "asca ( tanaka et al . 1994 ) conducted a two day observation of kes 73 on 11 - 12 oct 1993 . in this study , we use data acquired with the two solid state imaging spectrometers ( sis-0 and sis-1 ) , made available from the public archive .",
    "these sensors are sensitive to x - rays in the @xmath9 kev band , with a nominal spectral resolution of 2% at 6 kev ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution is limited by the x - ray mirrors , whose azimuthally averaged point spread function ( psf ) is characterized by a narrow core of fwhm @xmath11 , and extended wings that result in a half - power diameter of @xmath12 ( jalota et al .",
    "the sis data were acquired in 1-ccd mode , read out every 4 sec , using a combination of faint and bright data modes .",
    "the target was centered on the @xmath13 field - of - view of sis-0 ccd-1 .",
    "all data were edited using the standard rev1 screening criteria which resulted in an effective exposure of @xmath14 ksecs per sensor .",
    "a description of the data acquired with the other two focal plane instruments is presented in our companion paper ( gv97 ) .",
    "the broad - band image of kes 73 from the combined sis cameras contains 93 kcounts , with a count rate of 1.38 cps . in plate 1",
    "we display images of the kes73 region in the soft- and hard - band , below and above 2.5 kev , respectively .",
    "the images are centered on the point - like source , whose position is consistent with that of 1e1841@xmath0045 , to within the formal sis error circle ( gotthelf 1996 ) .",
    "the hard - band image clearly shows the clover - leaf shaped psf , consistent with an unresolved point source , whereas the soft - band image suggest an additional diffuse structure .",
    "the fwhm of the normalized brightness distribution profiles in the two bands are @xmath15 ( hard ) and @xmath16 ( soft ) ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "this difference is more apparent in the deconvolved images in the lower panel of plate 1 .",
    "these clearly show that the thermal x - ray shell is contained in the soft - band and surrounds the harder , bright compact source .",
    "the images have been restored with 50 iterations of the lucy algorithm ( lucy 1974 ) to deconvolve the complex shape of the psf , and are displayed in an identical fashion .",
    "an image of the snr nebulosity is made by subtracting the compact component from the soft - band image .",
    "for this , we used as a model psf the sis image of the moderately bright point - like source ex hydra , normalized by the derived source spectrum ( see below ) to estimate the relative contribution of the compact source to the total emission below 2.5 kev .",
    "the subtracted sis image closely follows the brightness distribution in the smoothed rosat hri image ( plate 1c ) , reproducing the three areas of enhanced emission .",
    "other features are easily ascribed to differences in the spectral response of the two instruments .",
    "see hwang & gotthelf ( 1997 ) for a discussion on interpreting features in the processed images .",
    "the broad winged asca psf does not allow spatial isolation of the point - source emission from that of the snr .",
    "instead we adopt a spatio - spectral decomposition method detailed in wang & gotthelf ( 1997 ) ( referred herein as wg97 ) to separate the spectra of the two components .",
    "we then use the decomposed point - source spectrum to : ( i ) verify and consolidate the fit to the point - source spectrum in the total spectrum of the kes73 region ( see  4.2 ) and ( ii ) compute fluxes and luminosities of the point - source .",
    "below we outline a modified version of the wg97 method , germane to a point source embedded within a snr shell .",
    "we start with the assumption that the spatial distribution of the kes73 emission consists of two components , i.e. , a point - source embedded in a diffuse nebula .",
    "we then decompose the source spectrum from the underlying nebula ( + background ) , by simultaneously solving for the source and nebular spectra using the ratio of observed and expected counts in concentric regions ; we search for deviations from the radial - average profile centered on the source , from that expected for a point - source .",
    "the original method , discussed in wg97 , assumes a uniform background . from the rosat hri morphology ,",
    "we know this is not the case for kes73 , for which the background consists of both the thermal - shell emission and the field - background .",
    "therefore , we use the hri data to estimate a correction factor to a uniform background from the relative counts in the source and nebular region .",
    "our procedure is as follows : ( i ) we first extract spectra from two annuli centered on the source ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the first annulus is a small circle ( @xmath17 ) encompassing the central pulsar counts .",
    "the second annulus ( @xmath18 ) is chosen to enclose the bulk of the shell emission .",
    "( ii ) next , we compute the expected radial profile for a point - source in these regions from a similar 1-ccd mode observation of ex hydra . to compensate for the non - uniform snr distribution",
    ", we compute a nebular correction factor using the relative counts per pixel between the center and edge of the projected hri x - ray nebula ( iii ) with the above information , we decompose the spectra in the two annuli into a source spectrum and a nebular spectrum using eqns .",
    "a2 3 - 4 of wg97 , applied to each spectral channel .",
    "the spectra separated into two unmixed components : a line dominated spectra expected from thermal emission of a shocked snr shell and a steep power - law continuum spectrum for the compact source .",
    "these are shown on plate 1a & 1b .",
    "no coercion or prejudice is used to force the clean separation into the distinct nebula and source spectra .",
    "the background subtracted source spectrum ( plate 1a ) accounts for the harder ( @xmath19 kev ) emission and provides an independent absorption measurement .",
    "the spectrum is trivially fitted with an absorbed power - law with a photon index @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath3 .",
    "the inferred unabsorbed luminosity is @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 , for an assumed distance of @xmath24 kpc ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the spectral shape ( @xmath25 ) is in accordance with the steep power - law spectra seen in other anomalous x - ray pulsars ( see corbet et al .",
    "we now use this fit to constrain the power - law emission component in the combined fit to the kes73 spectrum .",
    "the sis energy spectrum photons were selected from within a circular emission region of radius @xmath26 , limited by the size of the ccd .",
    "the broad asca psf makes background estimation extremely difficult , since the source flux from a diffuse object extends over most of the ccd chip . for this analysis",
    ", we extract a background spectrum from nearby archival pointings of the galactic ridge .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted spectrum of the shell plus compact source is shown in fig 2 .",
    "the line - dominated spectrum , typical of those seen from snrs , suffers high foreground absorption in the energy range below @xmath27 kev . in the energy range spanning @xmath28 kev",
    ", we see k - shell emission from highly ionized ions of mg , si , s , ca , and ar .",
    "the identified emission lines and their characteristic parameters are displayed in table 2 .",
    "collisional ionization equilibrium ( raymond & smith 1977 ; mewe et al . 1985 and references therein ) and thermal bremsstrahlung models with gaussians for line emission , are fit to the spectra .",
    "there are large residuals , in either case , in the hard - band ( 2.5 - 10.0 kev ) suggesting an extra emission component .",
    "the image analysis , spanning that energy range , clearly demonstrates that this component is mostly emission from the compact source , for which we add a single power - law to the fit .",
    "a bremsstrahlung continuum , with gaussians and a power - law tail provides the best fit ( see table 1 ) . in contrast , the single temperature raymond - smith model with fixed relative metal abundances and a power - law , is a relatively poor fit ; it shows large negative residuals mainly near the over - abundant mg feature , and a relatively large metal abundance of @xmath29 cosmic , driven mainly by the strong si ( 1.83 kev ) feature .",
    "in addition , we note excess flux in all our fits , at the lower energy range , @xmath30 kev , which we tentatively ascribe to o and ne .",
    "a lower limit on the snr age can be derived assuming free expansion of the spherical remnant . for a typical maximum velocity of @xmath31 km",
    "s@xmath23 seen in type ii sn , the projected size of kes73 , @xmath32 pc , contrains its age to be @xmath33 yrs . since most of the thermal emission is due to shocked matter of electron temperature @xmath34  kev , we compute a shock speed @xmath35 @xmath36 km s@xmath23 .",
    "this assumes ion and electron equilibrium behind the shock ( @xmath37 = 0.6 for cosmic abundances ) .",
    "inefficient electron heating would result in a larger shock velocity , i.e. , @xmath38 900 km s@xmath23 .",
    "if we assume that the remnant has entered a well developed sedov phase , @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath40 yr . this age is further reduced if the remnant is not fully in sedov phase . from spectral",
    "fitting , the total thermal ( @xmath41 kev ) luminosity of the snr is @xmath42 erg s@xmath23 ( this estimate excludes the uncertain , highly - absorbed emission from o and ne ) .",
    "the instantaneous power radiated from a shell is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mean pre - shock particle density and @xmath45 erg @xmath46 s@xmath23 is the cooling function ( mccray 1987 ) , and @xmath47 is the @xmath48 in units of 10@xmath49 k. we derive an @xmath44 @xmath50 0.8@xmath51 @xmath52 . under the strong - shock assumption",
    "the post - shock electron density is @xmath53 @xmath52 .",
    "kes 73 is evidently young , with the shocked plasma still ionizing and thus non - equilibrium effects in the ionization balance are important .",
    "we determined the diagnostic parameters for the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma from the line intensity ratios of he - like - k@xmath54 to h - like - k@xmath54 , as well as , he - like - k@xmath55 to he - like - k@xmath54 ionic transitions of individual ions , si and s in this case .",
    "the former ratio is a measure of the ionization degree and is dependent upon both the electron temperature @xmath48 and the ionization age @xmath56 t , the product of the electron density and time since the gas was last heated by the shock ( itoh 1977 ) .",
    "the latter ratio , however , is solely a function of @xmath57 .",
    "the obtained he - like - k@xmath55 to he - like - k@xmath54 ratio for si and s is @xmath58 and 0.089@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the he - like - k@xmath54 to h - like - k@xmath54 intensity ratio of si and s are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "we measure a @xmath62 kev and @xmath63 kev for si and s , respectively , assuming a single uniform plasma continuum and a power - law .",
    "these are in accordance with the @xmath48 derived from the single temperature bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "the ionization parameter was estimated to lie in the range @xmath64 ( masai 1984 ) .",
    "using the post - shock density inferred via normalization to the continuum component , we get @xmath65 yr .",
    "several independent arguments , therefore , suggest that kes73 is a young snr , @xmath66 yr - old , as indicated by earlier studies ( helfand et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we estimate the total mass of the swept - up interstellar gas to be @xmath67 m@xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to typical envelop masses ejected in a type ii supernova ( progenitor mass @xmath69 m@xmath68 ) , suggesting that the snr dynamics could well still be in a transitional stage between the free expansion and sedov phases .",
    "this notion is qualitatively consistent with the development of a strong reverse shock that can heat the metal - rich gas and cause the diffuse emission to be seen in the snr interior .",
    "additionally , the detection of strong mg , si , s , and ar emission and perhaps accompanying o and ne emission suggests ejecta - dominated gas . during their evolution",
    ", massive stars are expected to produce large amounts of o - group elements which are ejected during the supernova ( thieleman , nomoto & hashimoto 1994 ; woosley 1991 ) .",
    "these patterns have been observed in the x - ray spectra of o - rich snr ( see hughes & singh 1994 ; hayashi et al .",
    "1994 ) . here",
    "the emission is highly absorbed and does not permit quantitative estimates of o and ne emission ( although , upper - limits and observed photon excess in the spectral range 0.4 - 1 kev are consistent with abundant o and ne ) .",
    "the thermal spectrum of kes73 is remarkably similar to that of two young , distant ( therefore , high - absorbed ) type ii / ib snrs , g11.2@xmath00.3 and rcw103 .",
    "the former is a historical snr ( supernova a.d .",
    "386 ) and hence approximately the same age as kes73 ( vasisht et al . 1996 ) . unlike kes73",
    ", it contains a weak , but extended hard x - ray plerionic core .",
    "rcw103 is a virtual twin of kes73 ; both have radio - quiet , point - like x - ray sources in their centers , share morphological similarities , while neither shows evidence for a radio or x - ray plerion ( see gotthelf et al .",
    "1997 and refs therein ) .",
    "we infer a minimum energy in particles and nebular magnetic fields in the kes73 core to be @xmath70 erg , assuming crab - like parameters and equipartition between magnetic fields and relativistic particles ( pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "the lack of observed plerionic emission can be qualitatively explained in the following manner . if the kes73 pulsar has a large dipolar field",
    "@xmath71 g ( vg97 ) , a weak plerion is a natural consequence at an age of @xmath72 yr .",
    "such a pulsar loses most of its initial spin energy in a matter of @xmath50 years",
    ". the released pulsar wind would immediately suffer strong adiabatic and synchrotron losses .",
    "this leads to a bright plerion at an early age ( @xmath73 yrs ) with subsequent rapid decline in surface brightness .",
    "this effect is shown by bhattacharya ( 1990 ) in his paper on the morphology of snr with central pulsars .",
    "he shows that for pulsars with @xmath74-fields spanning the range @xmath75 g to @xmath76 g , the ones with the highest b have the faintest plerions at an elapsed time @xmath77 yr . for magnetars , @xmath78 g , this rapid decline in surface brightness may be much more pronounced .",
