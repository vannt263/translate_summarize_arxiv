    "never has the study of supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) been greeted with such attentiveness as in the past few years .",
    "although by the mid 1960s it was generally recognized that the energy source of the newly discovered quasars must be gravitational ( e.g. robinson 1965 ) , for the following three decades the existence of sbhs was destined to be surrounded by skepticism . by the mid 1990s , a few years after the launch of the hubble space telescope , it was widely accepted ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . today , sbhs feature prominently in models for the formation and evolution of their host galaxies ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "freed from the burden of having to demonstrate the very existence of sbhs , we can now begin asking cardinal questions : how did sbhs form , how do they accrete , how do they evolve , and what role do they play in the formation of cosmic structure ?    tackling such questions has been made possible by the discovery that sbhs are tightly related to the large - scale properties of their host galaxies .",
    "black holes masses , @xmath0 , correlate with the blue luminosity @xmath15 of the host bulge ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "even more compelling is the correlation between @xmath0 and the bulge velocity dispersion , @xmath16 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) . using the most up - to - date set of sbh mass measurements",
    "such a correlation can be written as :    @xmath17    ( ferrarese 2002 ) , where @xmath2 is normalized to an aperture of size one eighth the bulge effective radius .",
    "the @xmath6 relation has supplanted the @xmath18 relation as the tool of choice for the study of sbh demographics ( ferrarese 2002 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) , for the following reasons .",
    "the @xmath18 relation suffers from a large scatter ( a factor of several in @xmath0 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , most ( but not all ) of which is ascribable to lenticular and spiral galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 relation , on the other hand , appears to be intrinsically perfect ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a ; ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "it holds true for galaxies of disparate hubble types ( from sbs to compact ellipticals to cds ) belonging to wildly different environments ( from rich clusters to the field ) , showing perfectly smooth ( e.g. ngc 6251 ) or highly disturbed ( e.g. ngc 5128 ) morphologies .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 is a more faithful gauge of mass than @xmath15 : the @xmath6 relation thus betrays the existence of a tight connection between the masses of sbhs and those of the hot stellar component surrounding them ( merritt & ferrarese 2001b ) .",
    "have we indeed found , in the @xmath6 relation , the fossil record that links the formation and evolution of sbhs to those of their host galaxies ?",
    "the @xmath6 relation , and the equally tight relation recently discovered by graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) between @xmath0 and the central concentration of bulge light , probe the connection between sbhs and the baryonic component of galactic bulges .",
    "measurements of @xmath19 typically do not extend far enough to penetrate the region dominated by the dark matter ( dm ) component ( faber & gallagher 1979 ) . and",
    "yet , it is not the mass of the bulge but rather , the _ total mass _ @xmath20 of the galaxy or the mass @xmath1 of the dm halo , which is the key ingredient in most theoretical models proposed for the formation of sbhs ( adams , graff & richstone 2000 ; monaco et al .",
    "2000 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ; haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ; cattaneo , haehnelt & rees 1999 ; loeb & rasio 1994 ) . once a correlation with @xmath20 ( or @xmath1 ) is recovered by the models , the correlation with bulge mass is implicit because , in standard cdm scenarios , the bulge mass is loosely determined by the halo properties ( e.g. van den bosch 2000 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; zhang & wyse 2000 ) .",
    "this paper pursues , from an observational standpoint , the possibility of a link between @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath1 .",
    "a tight correlation is indeed found in the form of a relation between @xmath0 and the circular velocity of the sbh host galaxy , measured well beyond the optical radius .",
    "measuring the total gravitational mass of a galaxy is a formidable challenge . in bright ellipticals ,",
    "the temperature and density distribution of the thermal x - ray gas can lead to a measure of @xmath20 under the minimal condition of hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. fabricant , rybicki & gorenstein 1984 ) .",
    "however , while much progress is expected as chandra data are collected ,        .2 in    previous generations of x - ray satellites lacked the necessary combination of spectral response and sensitivity to allow an accurate measurement of all required observables ( e.g. biermann et al .",
    "1989 ; awaki et al .",
    "1994 ; matsushita et al .",
    "stars , globular cluster and planetary nebulae ( pne ) are good tracers of the gravitational potential ( e.g. saglia et al . 2000 ; ct et al . 2001 ; arnaboldi et al .",
    "however , the derived masses suffer large uncertainties due to the unknown velocity anisotropy of the system and , in particular for the case of pne , the small sample size of the tracers ( napolitano et al .",
    "2001 ; merritt & tremblay 1993 ) .    in spiral galaxies , however , the rotation curves of the cold disk component bear the direct imprint of the mass distribution . indeed ,",
    "the lack of a decline in the circular velocity @xmath4 at radii of order and beyond the optical radius of spirals was one of the first indications of the existence of a significant dark matter component ( rubin , ford & thonnard 1978 , 1980 ; rubin , thonnard & ford 1977 ; krumm & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "to first order , therefore , a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath20 would be reflected in a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "of the four spiral galaxies with a secure measurement of @xmath0 ( see the compilation by merritt & ferrarese 2002 ) only two , the milky way and ngc 4258 , have published rotation curves , both derived from 21-cm studies ( olling & merrifield 1998 ; van albada 1980 )",
    ". however , the sample can be augmented if one is willing to exchange @xmath0 for the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath2 , following equation ( 1 ) . of all spirals for which @xmath19 has been measured , 46 have rotation curves , either in hi ( 21 objects ) or optical ( 25 objects ) . for six of the galaxies with an hi rotation curve",
    ", warnings are found in the original papers as to the use of the published circular velocities for mass measurements .",
    "reasons include warps in the hi disk preventing one from deprojecting the observed rotation curve ( ngc 4565 , rupen 1991 ; ngc 891 , rogstad & shostak 1972 ; ngc 1808 , saika et al .",
    ".2 in    1980 , koribalski et al . 1993 ) and/or the presence of significant non - circular motion in the hi gas ( ngc 3079 , irwin & seaquist 1991 ; ngc 3031 , rots & shane 1975 ; ngc 4736 , van der kruit 1974 ) .",
    "for two of the galaxies with an optical rotation curve ( ngc 3200 and ngc 7171 ) , two values of @xmath19 discrepant at the @xmath21% level exist in the literature ( mcelroy 1995 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1984 ; dressler 1984 ) ; these galaxies have also been excluded from the sample .",
    "data and references for the remaining 38 galaxies are given in table 1 .",
    "to allow for the application of equation ( 1 ) , the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath19 is corrected to the equivalent of an aperture of radius @xmath22 following the prescriptions of jorgensen , franx & kjaergaard ( 1995 ) .",
    "the bulge effective radius @xmath23 is taken from baggett et al .",
    "( 1998 , but see notes to table 1 ) .",
    "1 shows the circular velocity versus the bulge velocity dispersion within @xmath22 for all galaxies in table 1 .",
    "the correlation is immediately apparent , but a few observations are in order .",
    "first , a glance at table 1 will reveal that the most noticeable difference between the two samples of optical and hi rotation curves is , not surprisingly , that while only two of the optical rotation curves extend beyond @xmath25 , the galaxy radius at the @xmath26 mag arcsec@xmath27 isophote , all but one of the hi rotation curves do .",
    "inspection of the original papers shows that the hi rotation curves all exhibit a common pattern .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. sofue & rubin 2001 and references therein ) that as one moves away from the center , @xmath4 rises rapidly , peaks somewhere between 3 and 15 kpc , and then remains flat ( sometimes after a modest initial decline ) until the last measured point , typically @xmath28 kpc .",
    "optical rotation curves rarely extend beyond 10 kpc ; at this distance @xmath4 has not yet settled into a flat rotation curve . in fig .",
    "1 , galaxies with rotation curves not extending beyond @xmath25 ( shown as errorbars only ) appear to display larger scatter , relative to the mean correlation defined by all galaxies , than the galaxies with a more extended rotation curve .",
    ".2 in    second , a simple visual inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that among the galaxies with @xmath29 , ngc 598 (= m33 , the galaxy with the lowest value of @xmath2 in the plot ) is a clear outlier .",
    "furthermore , the two galaxies with @xmath30  seem to have a significantly larger circular velocity that would be inferred if a linear fit ( in @xmath31 ) were to be performed to the rest of the sample .    to quantify the above statements",
    ", we performed a regression analysis ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) to all galaxies except ngc 598 ( table 2 and dotted line in fig .",
    "1 ) . fig .",
    "2 shows the residuals from the best fit as a function of @xmath32 , confirming the larger scatter for galaxies with rotation curves not extending beyond @xmath25 .",
    "for the scope of this paper , the usefulness of @xmath4 is directly related to how confidently @xmath4 can be used as an estimator of the total galactic mass , which in turns depends critically on the radial extent of the rotation curve . therefore , after dutifully noting that the regression analysis produces consistent fits whether the entire sample , or just the galaxies for which @xmath29 are used ( table 2 ) , we will only retain the latter sample in the remainder of this paper .    because of its apparently negligible intrinsic scatter ( a reduced @xmath33 of 0.70 , table 2 ) and the fact that it does not follow directly from simple dynamical arguments ( see  3.1 ) , the @xmath24 relation is of obvious interest",
    "however , by targeting only spiral galaxies it lacks generality ; furthermore , it samples a narrow range in @xmath2 , @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the @xmath24 relation observed for the spirals with the one derived recently by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a sample of 21 elliptical galaxies . for this sample ,",
    "circular velocity curves are derived by applying non - parametric spherical models to the observed stellar absorption line profiles , velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles .",
    "kronawitter et al .",
    "conclude that the rotation curves resulting from the models are very likely nearly self - similar : all rotation curves are consistent with being flat outside 0.3@xmath23 , with @xmath23 the galaxy s effective radius . as pointed out by gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , @xmath4 is expected to be linearly related to any other velocity scale , for instance @xmath2 , as a consequence of the near dynamical homology .",
    "the constant of proportionality is likely to depend slightly on the details of the models ; kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) do not discuss this point explicitely , but by comparing their results to the those obtained by van der marel ( 1991 ) and lauer ( 1985 ) for the same galaxies , variations of the order of a few tens of a percent are possible if different dynamical models are used .",
    "3 shows the @xmath24 relation for the combined samples of 16 spirals with @xmath29 ( solid circles ) plus the 20 ellipticals from kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 , open circles ) .",
    "values of @xmath19 for the ellipticals are taken from davies et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , and corrected to a common aperture size as detailed for the bulges .",
    "as expected , we recover the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath2 already reported by gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the fact that the spiral and elliptical samples follow the same relation is unexpected ( see  3.1 ) and points to a common cause connecting galaxy dynamics at small and large scales across the entire hubble sequence .",
    "a regression analysis to the ellipticals produces a fit consistent with the one obtained for the spirals once the two galaxies with @xmath30  are excluded ( fits 3 and 4 in table 2 ) .",
    "if a linear fit is forced , @xmath36 for the ellipticals and @xmath37 for the spirals .",
    "however , because the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath2 for the ellipticals is partly due to the scale - free nature of the models , we use only the sample of 13 spirals with @xmath39 and @xmath40   in deriving the best fit to the @xmath24 relation :    @xmath41    while this fit is strictly derived in the @xmath42  range , it can also be considered valid in the @xmath43  range populated by the ellipticals ( fig . 3 and table 2 ) . as is the case for the @xmath6 relation ,",
    "the reduced @xmath44 of the fit points to a relation with negligible intrinsic scatter .",
    "the tightness of the @xmath24 relation is suprising to the point of arising suspicions that we might be dealing with a tautology .    the most trivial case to consider is the following : a strict proportionality between @xmath2 and @xmath4 would result if both responded to the same mass distribution .",
    "for instance , if the region within which @xmath2 is measured extends to radii where the rotation curve is flat , @xmath2 would naturally be linearly related to @xmath4 simply by virtue of the virial theorem .",
    "this is not the case for any of the galaxies considered here : even for the bulges with the largest effective radius , @xmath2 only samples the innermost 0.5 kpc , while the rotation curve does not settle to a constant velocity until much farther out , typically 4 to 20 kpc .",
    "4 plots the ratio of bulge central velocity dispersion to disk circular velocity against the ratio of the radii at which the two are measured ( the radius at which @xmath4 peaks is taken as a lower limit to the radius at which the circular velocity first settles onto a flat curve ) . as can be seen",
    ", @xmath45 ranges from values of a few to over 100 .",
    "even so , if rotation curves of spiral galaxies formed a nearly homologous family , as is the case for the elliptical galaxies of gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , @xmath4 or @xmath2 would be linearly related        .2 in    ( however , the constant of proportionality would depend on the details of the mass density profile , and there would be no reason for the elliptical and spiral samples to define a common relation ) . unlike gerhard s ellipticals , however , spiral galaxies show a strong dynamical non - homology : both the profile shape and the amplitude of the rotation curves depend on the galaxy luminosity ( casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; persic , salucci & stel 1996 ) . therefore , a linear relation , or a relation at all , between @xmath4 and @xmath2 is not expected a priori .",
    "the two arguments presented above also explain why the @xmath24 relation is not a direct result of the so called `` disk - halo conspiracy '' .",
    "most rotation curves are characterized by a reasonably flat rotation curve in the outer parts .",
    "this implies that the mass density profiles of the luminous and dark matter must be coupled , thereby `` conspiring '' to produce a flat rotation curve and the absence of conspicuous features marking the edge of the luminous component ( casertano & van gorkom 1991 ) .",
    "however the conspiracy breaks down in the inner , bulge dominated region , which is always characterized by a steeply increasing rotation curve whose detailed shape and overall slope depends strongly on the galaxy luminosity and morphological type ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 ; sofue et al . 1999 ) . for the galaxies in our sample , only for ngc 2841 the case",
    "could be made of a bulge - disk conspiracy : the rotation curve is approximatively flat all the way to the innermost point , @xmath46 kpc ( begeman 1987 ) . in all other cases ,",
    "the bulge contribution is insignificant by the time the flat part of the rotation curve is reached ( broeils 1992 ; kent 1987 ) . in other words there is no direct evidence in these galaxies of a coupling between bulge and halo .",
    "at most , a connection between the @xmath24 relation and the disk - halo conspiracy can be thought of in the following terms .",
    "a rough correlation exists between maximum rotational velocity and hubble type ( e.g. casertano & van gorkom 1991 ) ; coupled with the correlation between hubble type and bulge luminosity and between the latter and the bulge velocity dispersion ( kormendy & illingworth 1983 ) , a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath2 ensues .",
    "however , as in the case for the @xmath6 relation , which is `` expected '' given the @xmath18 and the faber - jackson relation , the @xmath24 relation is tighter , and therefore more fundamental , than any of the correlations mentioned above .",
    "one last possibility to explore is whether the @xmath24 relation could be nothing but the tully - fisher relation in disguise .",
    "verheijen ( 2001 ) finds negligible intrinsic scatter for the @xmath47-band tully - fisher relation when the circular velocity in the flat part of the rotation curve is substituted to the maximum rotational velocity .",
    "the tightness of the relation implies a fundamental connection between dm halo mass and the total baryonic mass .",
    "the connection with bulge mass ( and hence @xmath2 ) is however not immediate ( norman , sellwood & hasan 1996 ) .",
    "for instance , the bulge to disk fraction could conceivably depend on the detailed form of the halo angular momentum profile ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) and the details of the angular momentum exchange between gas clouds during dissipation ( van den bosch et al .",
    "it should be further noticed that verheijen ( 2001 ) finds that the tully - fisher relation holds with negligible intrinsic scatter down to @xmath48 , while the @xmath24 relation shown in figure 3 seems to break down below @xmath49 .",
    "not being the result of a dynamical tautology , the near invariance of @xmath50 over two orders of magnitude in @xmath51 seems to indicate a remarkable uniformity in the ( luminous + dark ) mass density profile along the hubble sequence . in particular , characterizing the slope and normalization of the relation might help in constraining theoretical models and numerical simulation ( e.g. steinmetz & muller 1995 ) following the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in  2 , the existence of the @xmath24 relation is strongly suggestive of a tight correlation between @xmath0 and the total gravitational mass of the sbh host galaxy . if the rotation curves for all galaxies plotted in fig .",
    "3 are flat at a distance @xmath52 from the center , i.e. @xmath53 , the virial theorem ensures that @xmath54 .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) then imply @xmath55 .",
    "several proposed scenarios trace the origin of sbhs to the very early stages of structure formation ( cattaneo , haehnelt & rees 1999 ; silk & rees 1998 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; umemura , loeb & turner 1993 ) . by defining the depth of the potential well , the mass and distribution of the dm halo control not only the formation of sbhs , but also their relationship to the luminous matter .",
    "relating @xmath4 to @xmath1 is no trivial task , but at least a rough attempt can be made as follows . in a cdm - dominated universe",
    ", @xmath1 is uniquely determined by the halo velocity @xmath56 measured at the virial radius , @xmath57 .",
    "the latter is defined as the radius at which the mean density exceeds the mean universal density by a constant factor , generally referred to as the `` virial overdensity '' @xmath58 .",
    "based on this definition , and in virtue of the virial theorem , it immediately follows that @xmath1 must be proportional to the third power of @xmath56 .",
    "being a function of @xmath58 , the constant of proportionality depends on the adopted cosmology and may vary with time ( e.g. bryan & norman 1998 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) . for the purpose of this paper , we will adopt the same @xmath7cdm cosmological model used by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . under these assumptions :    @xmath59        .2 in    ( bullock et al . 2001 ) .    in a zeroth order approximation",
    ", we might assume that @xmath60 .",
    "combining equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) gives :    @xmath61    however , for any reasonable shape of the dm density profile , the circular velocity will decrease towards @xmath57 , in other words , @xmath4 as listed in table 1 is most certainly an upper limit to @xmath38 .",
    "the shape of the rotation curve , and therefore the @xmath62 ratio is of course strongly dependent on the assumed dm density profile .",
    "we will again follow bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in adopting an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) characterized by an `` inner '' radius @xmath63 . in this specific application , @xmath64 is a function of two variables , the concentration parameter @xmath65 and the ratio @xmath66 ( bullock et al . 2001 ) .",
    "n - body simulations ( bullock et al . 2001 ) show that for present day halos in the @xmath67 @xmath11 range , @xmath68 depends weakly on @xmath1 : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is in units of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath71 kpc ( klypin et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath72 kpc , i.e. @xmath63 is likely sampled by the flat hi rotation curves used in deriving the @xmath24 relation .",
    "this is a reasonable conclusion : in the region of space dominated by dm , the turnover in the rotation curve can be roughly expected to coincide with the turnover in the dm density profile .",
    "therefore , by assuming @xmath73 , @xmath64 is a function of @xmath1 only . by using equation ( 3 ) to express @xmath38 as a function of @xmath1 , bullock s et al .",
    "results can be approximated as :    @xmath74    by using equation ( 5 ) to transform @xmath4 to @xmath1 , and equation ( 1 ) to transform @xmath2 to @xmath0 , equation ( 2 ) can be written as ( fig .",
    "5 ) :    @xmath75    a third , completely independent way of converting the @xmath24 relation into a relation between sbh and dm halo masses is the following .",
    "observational constraints on the mass density profiles of dm halos have been recently derived ( seljak 2002 ) by combining observations of galaxy - galaxy lensing with the tully - fisher and fundamental plane relations . for @xmath76 galaxies , the circular velocity at the virial radius decreases by a factor 1.8 from its peak value at the optical radius .",
    "this decline is steeper than predicted by bullock s et al .",
    "( 2001 ) numerical simulations , possibly due to the neglect , in the latter work , of the baryonic contribution to the rotation curves at optical radii ( seljak 2002 ) .    by assuming @xmath77 ,",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 becomes :    @xmath78    comparing equations ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) can give a rough idea of how the functional dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 depends on the assumptions made for the dm density profile and the resulting rotation curve .",
    "the @xmath79 relation implies that the formation of sbhs is controlled , perhaps indirectly , by the properties of the dm halos in which they reside .",
    "whether the connection between sbhs and dm halos is of a more fundamental nature than the one between sbhs and bulges , reflected in the @xmath6 relation , is unclear at this time .",
    "the @xmath6 relation implies a scatter of the order of @xmath80% in @xmath0 for @xmath81 .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath79 relation is difficult to determine , since the uncertainty in the transformation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 is largely unknown .",
    "bullock et al . ( 2001 ) estimate @xmath82 . in the range",
    "@xmath83 , this translates into a 5% to 7% error in @xmath1 in equation ( 5 ) , and a 9% to 12% error on @xmath0 in equation ( 6 ) .",
    "this indicates that , at least formally , the scatter in the @xmath79 relation could be a factor two smaller than the scatter in the @xmath6 relation for any given choice of dm density profile and cosmological parameters .",
    "secure conclusions , however , will have to await an empirical characterization of the @xmath79 relation , with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 determined directly from observations .",
    "additional clues on how bulges and dm halos influence the formation of sbhs can be derived by studying bulgeless spirals .",
    "such galaxies have been forcefully neglected in the present study , where we required the existence of a bulge velocity dispersion in order to derive @xmath0 . of the galaxies in table 1 , ngc598 is the one with the least conspicuous bulge . ic342 and ngc 6503 are late type spirals with minimal bulges ; like ngc598 , they deviate significantly from the @xmath4 relation defined by the more massive systems .",
    "all of the galaxies with no or minimal bulge for which a rotation curve exists , including both dwarf systems and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , have circular velocities below 150 ( e.g. blais - oulette , amram & carignan 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , in the lsb compilation of van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the only two galaxies with maximum circular velocity in excess of 150   are also the only galaxies with a significant bulge component .",
    "therefore , it does seem that bulges , as well as sbhs , are always formed in halos with circular velocity in excess of @xmath84 . in",
    "less massive halos , the interplay between halo , bulge and the central sbh remains to be investigated .",
    "for this purpose attempts to directly measure the mass of a putative sbh in bulgeless galaxies is of primary importance .",
    "whether equation ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) or ( 7 ) is adopted , @xmath0 does not depend linearly on @xmath1 . according to equation ( 6 ) ,",
    "the ratio between sbh and halo mass decreases from @xmath85 at @xmath86 @xmath11 to @xmath87 at @xmath88 @xmath11 , i.e. less massive halos are less efficient in forming sbhs .",
    "this tendency becomes more pronounced for halos with @xmath89 @xmath11 : as mentioned above , ngc 6503 , ngc 3198 and ngc 598 lie above the relation defined by the more massive galaxies .",
    "it must be pointed out , however , that the @xmath6 relation is not defined for @xmath90 @xmath11 , indeed we have no direct evidence of the existence of nuclear black holes in this mass range . if such sbhs exist , the recent report of an upper limit of only a few @xmath91 @xmath11 for the bh in ngc 598 ( merritt , ferrarese & joseph 2001 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ) , indicates that they are not more massive than would be inferred by extrapolating the @xmath6 relation to the @xmath92   range .",
    "this excludes the possibility that ngc 6503 and ngc 3198 could be reconciled with the @xmath79 relation defined by the more massive galaxies .",
    "these findings are in qualitative agreement with the formation scenario envisioned by haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) and silk & rees ( 1998 ) . in an attempt to match the dm halo mass function to the luminosity function of quasars , haehnelt et al . noted that as the quasar lifetime is increased , a match can be obtained only at the expense of steepening the slope of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in their model",
    ", a linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 implies a quasar lifetime @xmath93 yr , about a factor 100 shorter than favored by current observational constraints ( e.g. martini & weinberg 2001 ; ferrarese 2002 ) .",

    "gas gravitating in a dm halo is deposited at the center of the halo at a rate which is proportional to the third power of the halo circular velocity @xmath38 .",
    "stars more massive than @xmath96 @xmath11 undergo post - newtonian instabilities  and therefore collapse  before they can ignite hydrogen ; for @xmath38 larger than @xmath97 , such stars can be formed on short enough timescales that the collapse will take place before the star has had a chance to burn all of its fuel . only halos with @xmath98  ( or masses @xmath99 @xmath11 )",
    "would therefore host sbhs , and only sbhs with @xmath100 @xmath11 can be formed in such halos .",
    "it is therefore possible that galaxies such as ngc 6503 and ngc 3198 do not contain sbhs .",
    "the results in this paper can be summarized as follows :    * we have considered a sample of 15 spiral galaxies with published measurements of both the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath2 and the disk circular velocity @xmath4 , measured beyond the optical radius .",
    "the sample displays a tight correlation between the two quantities .",
    "furthermore , in a @xmath101 plane , the narrow strip occupied by the spirals blends smoothly with that occupied by a sample of 20 elliptical galaxies ( from kronawitter et al .",
    "2001 and gerhard et al .",
    "this is an interesting result , in view of the different methods used to derive @xmath4 for the two samples , and of the dissimilarities between the shapes of the rotation curves observed in spirals and modelled in elliptical galaxies . *",
    "the ellipticals and spirals define a common , linear ( in a log - log plane ) @xmath24 relation for @xmath102 .",
    "three galaxies have @xmath2 below this range ; all three deviate from the relation in the sense of having smaller than expected values of @xmath2 .",
    "the discrepancy is largest  a factor 7 larger than the standard deviation on @xmath2  for the galaxy with the smallest value of @xmath2 , ngc 598 .",
    "* rotation curves for all of the galaxies appear to be flat in the outer parts . in virtue of the @xmath6 relation and the virial theorem",
    ", the @xmath24 relation must therefore imply that the masses of supermassive black holes correlate with the gravitational mass of their host galaxy , measured within a given radius @xmath103 . *",
    "if the further concession is made that , in cdm scenarios of structure formation , the virial mass of the dm halo is uniquely determined by @xmath4 ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 , bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) , the @xmath24 relation is the observational evidence that sbh masses correlate tightly with the mass of the dm halos in which , presumably , they are formed .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is nonlinear : the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath1 decreases with decreasing halo mass .",
    "this trend becomes more severe for @xmath104 @xmath11 .",
