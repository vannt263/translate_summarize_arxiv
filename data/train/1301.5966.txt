    "shot noise is an important source of fluctuations in dynamical systems .",
    "the discreteness of the modulating force which underlies such noise can be due to the quantization of the electromagnetic radiation that drives the system or the discreteness of the electron charge or spin in the electric or spin current in the system .",
    "the features of the system dynamics provide means for identifying the noise statistics , which is sensitive to the microscopic nature of the noise source .",
    "an example of using the dynamics for detecting non - gaussian noise statistics is the recent theoretical and experimental work on noise - induced switching between coexisting stable states in josephson junctions and mechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "the strong effect of the noise discreteness is easy to see for a strongly damped noise - driven system localized in a potential well .",
    "if the noise pulses are all of the same sign , the noise pushes the system only in one direction , and the stationary probability distribution of the system is equal to zero on the one side of its stable state . in the case of shot noise ,",
    "the distribution turns out to be singular near the stable state both for the case of pulses with random exponentially distributed amplitude @xcite and pulses of constant amplitude @xcite . depending on the pulse rate relative to the system relaxation rate ,",
    "it either displays a power - law divergence or goes to zero as a power law of the distance to the stable state .    in this paper",
    "we study the probability distribution for a shot ( poisson ) noise - driven system with arbitrary damping .",
    "our results extend from the limit of overdamped dynamics to underdamped dynamics , where the relaxation rate is small compared to the typical vibration frequency of the system .",
    "examples of underdamped systems that are of interest for studying poisson - noise induced fluctuations include josephson junctions @xcite , nano - magnetic oscillators @xcite , and high - q nanomechanical resonators coupled to electron tunneling , to mention but a few ; the problem attracted much attention recently in the context of the studies of radiation - pressure shot noise with optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "we assume that the poisson noise pulses have constant amplitude , which is relevant for most of the above systems .",
    "one would expect that , for an underdamped system , the aforementioned singularity of the probability distribution at the stable state should disappear .",
    "indeed , in this case the noise makes the system perform random vibrations .",
    "therefore , it contrast to an overdamped system , the probability distribution is nonzero on the both sides of the stable state .",
    "however , we find that the power - law singularity at the stable state persists .",
    "moreover , we find that the probability distribution of poisson - noise driven underdamped systems can display multiple power - law singularities , with positions forming a geometric progression .",
    "to gain an additional insight into this unusual structure we look at the probability distribution of the system energy .",
    "we show that this distribution also has singularities .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that more is known about the tail of the distribution of poisson - noise driven systems @xcite than about its central part , which is singular .",
    "unless the noise is very strong , this central part is formed by the motion of the system near its stable state , which is generally described by linear equations of motion .",
