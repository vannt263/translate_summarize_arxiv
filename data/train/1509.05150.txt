    "neutron star ( ns ) constitutes one of the best astrophysical laboratories for studying dense matter physics .",
    "it arises at the end of life of a 8 - 20 @xmath3 massive stars and forms in the aftermath of the core collapse supernovae explosion .",
    "a newly born ns is very hot with temperature as high as @xmath6-@xmath7k , but rapidly cools to a temperature of less than @xmath8k within minutes .",
    "the cooling process of a ns is dominated by a combination of surface photon emission and interior neutrino emission .",
    "the latter is responsible for about @xmath9-@xmath10 years until the interior temperature reaches @xmath10k .",
    "it is generally known that photon luminosity is obviously lower than neutrino luminosity , meaning that the thermal radiation from a ns surface reflects the intensity of interior neutrino emission@xcite . while neutrino emisision depends strongly on the composition of superdense matter in nss .",
    "it is well known that nss cores are dense enough to allow for emerging exotic matter with the strangeness quantum number through weak equilibrium , such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 hyperons , referred as nphe@xmath4 matter , except for the conventional nucleons and leptons ( npe@xmath4 matter)@xcite .",
    "it means that all the possible baryon neutrino emission processes would happen during the neutrino cooling stage @xcite . among them ,",
    "the most powerful enhancement of neutrino emission is provided by the nucleon direct urca processes ( ndup ) , secondarily is the hyperon direct urca processes ( hdup ) @xcite . besides",
    ", the degrees of freedom of hyperons tend to soften the equation of state ( eos ) calculated in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model based on su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry(quark model for the vector meson - hyperon coupling constants ) , then reduce the maximum mass of ns to about 1.6 - 1.7@xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however , demorest et al . in 2010@xcite indicated that the binary millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 expanded the maximum observational mass from 1.67 @xmath17 0.02@xmath3 to 1.97 @xmath17 0.04@xmath3 using the shapiro delay measurements from radio timing observations .",
    "antoniadis et al . in 2013@xcite observed another massive neutron star psr j0348 + 0432 , whose mass is 2.01 @xmath17 0.04@xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of hyperons in such heavy ns cores are difficult to explain by su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry in rmf model . and",
    "for this reason , the su(3 ) flavor symmetry is widely applied to rmf model . because it changes the strength of the isoscalar , vector - meson(@xmath18 and @xmath19 ) couplings to the octet states , which can sustain a ns with mass of ( 1.8 - 2.1)@xmath3 even if hyperons exist in ns core @xcite .",
    "furthermore , baryons in ns interior can become the superfluid state related to the generation of bb cooper pairs under attractive interaction .",
    "the baryon superfluidity(sf ) could suppress considerably the ndup , hdup and thus affect the cooling rate of ns remarkably @xcite . as we all know , the neutrons in the crust and protons , hyperons in the core undergo cooper pair in @xmath5 state , while neutrons in the core can pair in @xmath20 state .

    "though the coupling @xmath108 for case ( iii ) is smaller than the corresponding value for case ( i ) as shown in table 1 , the total repulsive force is attributed not only to @xmath18 meson but also to @xmath19 meson . as seen in fig . 1 and 2 , though we consider the contribution of the strange mesons @xmath107 and @xmath19 on the eos in case ( ii ) , the coupling @xmath109=0 .",
    "it means that @xmath19 meson only couples to hyperons and makes the eos be not enough stiff .",
    "so the hardest eos is obtained only through the @xmath19 meson in case ( iii ) . from case ( i ) to ( iii ) , the maximum mass of ns ( the corresponding center density ) sequently increases from 1.820 ( 0.771 ) , 1.863 ( 0.817 ) to 2.141@xmath3 ( 0.871 ) for the gm1 model , 1.686 ( 0.673 ) , 1.729 ( 0.754 ) to 2.038@xmath3 ( 0.848 ) for the tm1 model , respectively ( fig .",
    "namely , the eos in su(3 ) flavor symmetry could be consistent with the observed values of psr j1614 - 2230 and j0348 + 0432 when hyperons appear in ns core .",
    "3 depicts the neutrino emissivities of the reactions a , b , c in nphe@xmath4 matter for the three cases . in order to make the effects of hyperons and reactions b , c on a more intuitive , fig .",
    "4 depicts the total neutrino emissivity of the reactions a , b , c in npe@xmath4 and nphe@xmath4 matter for case ( iii ) . as can be seen from figs . 3 and 4",
    ", the neutrino emissivity of the reaction a has a tendency to decrease with increasing of the baryon density @xmath39 due to the presence of hyperons in ns matter decreases the nucleon and lepton fractions according to the requirement of the charge neutrality and @xmath110 equilibium conditions(eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) ) . also , the neutrino emissivities of the reactions b and c are obviously less than that of a , it is due to that they have smaller matrix elements in eq.(22 ) .",
    "the strongest neutrino emissivity of the reaction a or b is in case ( iii ) , while the weakest one is observed in case ( i ) . for the reaction c ,",
    "the neutrino emissivity in case ( iii ) is less than the corresponding values in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) firstly and then increases slowly , equals or exceeds the values in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) . while the reactions d - f would never happen within stable nss , because their threshold densities are larger than the center densities of maximum mass nss . as shown in figs . 2 and 3 , the mass ranges of the reactions b and c in case ( iii ) are @xmath111m@xmath112 and @xmath113m@xmath112 for the gm1 model , @xmath114m@xmath112 and @xmath115m@xmath112 for tm1 model , respectively . next we mainly discuss the effects of the degrees of freedom of hyperons and reactions b , c on the total neutrino emissivity , neutrino luminosity , energy gap of @xmath5 proton sf and ns cooling in case ( iii ) .",
    "5 gives the radial distributions of the total neutrino emissivities of the reactions a , b , c for the gm1 model with 1.98 , 2.00 , 2.10 , 2.12m@xmath112 stars in case ( iii ) .",
    "the radial distributions of the total neutrino emissivity for the same mass stars in npe@xmath4 and nphe@xmath4 matter are almost unchanged when r is relatively large ( part i ) . however , the reactions b and c happen in succession as the radius decreases ( part ii and iii ) , leading to the radial distributions of the total neutrino emissivities in nphe@xmath4 matter are significantly larger than the values in npe@xmath4 matter . while the radius regions of the increasing total neutrino emissivities shrink continually with the increasing ns mass",
    "the situation of the tm1 model is like the above in gm1 model .",
    "6 shows the total neutrino luminosity as a function of ns mass m in case(iii ) . as seen from fig .",
    "6 , whether hyperons are included or not , the neutrino luminosity increases firstly and then decreases with the increasing of the baryon density @xmath39 .",
    "once the mass of ns reaches a value , one luminosity corresponds to two different nss . and the total neutrino luminosities of reactions a , b , c within the mass range @xmath116m@xmath112 and @xmath117m@xmath112 will be larger than the values in npe@xmath4 matter for the gm1 and tm1 models , respectively .",
    "fig.7 shows the @xmath5 proton sf critical temperatures as a function of the baryon density @xmath39 for case(iii ) in npe@xmath4 matter(solid lines ) and nphe@xmath4 matter(dashed lines ) , respectively .",
    "one can find that whether or not the ns core appears hyperons , the @xmath5 proton sf critical temperature first increases , reaches a peak and then decreases to zero as the baryon density @xmath39 increases .",
    "while when the ns core appears hyperons , the @xmath5 proton sf critical temperatures are first below and then above the corresponding values in npe@xmath4 matter within the density ranges of @xmath118 @xmath119(@xmath120 @xmath119 for the tm1 model ) and @xmath121 @xmath119(@xmath122 @xmath119 for the tm1 model ) for the gm1 model , respectively .",
    "it is because the total contribution of the fermi momentum and single - particle energy of protons ( see eqs.(11 ) and ( 27 ) ) results in @xmath123 change . besides",
    ", the density range of the @xmath5 proton sf is widened due to the inclusion of hyperons .",
    "the range of @xmath5 proton sf can achieve coverage or partial coverage in the cores of nss , which is highly relevant to the reactions a , b. that is , the presence of hyperons affects not only the reaction a and @xmath5 proton sf critical temperature , but also the ns cooling . in figs . 8 and 9 ,",
    "the cooling curves of nss are calculated through solving the cooling eq.(24 ) by assuming isothermal ns cores for case(iii ) .",
    "observational data of 8 isolated nss whose effective surface temperatures have been measured or constrained are listed as compared with the theoretical cooling curves @xcite . as you can see from figs . 8 and 9",
    ", the cooling curves of moderate mass nss can explain the observational data , while the cooling curves for massive nss due to the low surface temperature are difficult to explain the existing observational data . and the cooling curves decrease smoothly with the increasing ns mass , meaning that the cooling of massive nss undergoes faster neutrino cooling whether the reactions b and c appear in nss .",
    "in addition , the same mass stars with the reactions b , c(dashed lines ) are colder than that in npe@xmath4 matter(solid lines ) . taking case ( iii)in gm1 model as an example",
    ", we can see that the neutrino luminosity of 1.70 , 1.95 , 2.03 m@xmath112 nss in nphe@xmath4 matter are greater than the corresponding values in npe@xmath4 matter which is because the three nss within the mass range @xmath124m@xmath112 , see fig .",
    "6 for details . while the @xmath5 proton sf critical temperatures @xmath123 of 1.70 , 1.95 , 2.03 m@xmath112 in nphe@xmath4 matter is lower than the value in npe@xmath4 matter(see figs . 2 and 7 for details ) , in the case we studied here . as a result , the reactions a , b are suppressed in advance in nphe@xmath4 matter .",
    "however , the reaction c is not affected by the @xmath5 proton sf . therefore , although the neutrino emissivities of the reactions a and b are suppressed with the presence of the @xmath5 proton sf , the total contribution of reactions a , b , c can still speed up a massive ns cooling .",
    "for the tm1 model , the situation is similar to the described in gm1 model .",
    "the cooling curves presented here are estimates in order to make the effects of the @xmath5 proton sf on the reactions a and b be more clearly , in particular , the effects of ns crust and hyperons sf are not considered .",
    "we have studied the effects of the degrees of freedom of hyperons and reactions b , c on the reaction a in ns matter using the two popular rmf parameter sets , gm1 and tm1 , respectively .",
    "firstly , we used the su(3 ) flavor symmetry to obtain the relatively stiff eos for supporting the observed massive psr j1614 - 2230 and j0348 + 0432 .",
    "secondly , the total neutrino luminosity of the reactions a , b , c are calculated in npe@xmath4 and nphe@xmath4 matter , respectively .",
    "we found that the presence of the reactions b and c caused of the total neutrino luminosity higher than the corresponding values in npe@xmath4 matter within the mass range @xmath116m@xmath112 for the gm1 model and @xmath117m@xmath112 for the tm1 model .",
    "finally , our main purpose is to test the effects of the @xmath5 proton sf on the reactions a , b by comparing cooling curves with observed data .",
    "we will analyze the effects of other baryon sf on the corresponding baryon direct urca processes in future work .",
    "our results showed that the cooling rate of the same mass of two nss with the reactions b and c are obviously faster than that without the reactions b and c. these features maybe can help to prove the presence of hyperons in massive nss cores ."
