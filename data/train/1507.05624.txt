    "the velocity distribution of the stars in the solar neighborhood plays a key role in understanding the global structure , dynamical features , and the evolution of the milky way .",
    "although it is often approximated with a multi - dimensional gaussian profile , the velocity distribution of the stars in the solar neighborhood is actually very complicated .",
    "the mean value of the velocity distribution should be around zero , given that the galactic disk is in static state .",
    "however , observations have found many substructures @xcite , which may be associated with the perturbation of the galactic bar and spiral arms , or belong to old tidal debris of disrupted clusters or dwarf galaxies @xcite , in the velocity distribution .",
    "these substructures may shift the mean velocity slightly away from zero by a few @xmath7 .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the stellar number density is not symmetric with respect to the galactic mid - plane , implying a vertical wave in the stellar disk .",
    "@xcite inferred that the merging event of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy can induce such density waves .",
    "the vertical asymmetry in stellar count may be associated with vertical asymmetry in velocity .",
    "indeed , @xcite found from the lamost dr1 data that not only radial velocity but also the vertical velocity of the nearby stars are not symmetric .",
    "these new observational evidences challenge the current dynamical models of the disk .",
    "at least some of the nearby disk stars are not in equilibrium , although the majority must be in the static state so that the galactic disk can survive over billions of years .",
    "more investigation is required to figure out how many and which types of stars contribute to the asymmetric motion , which is our main motivation of this work .",
    "the velocity distribution can be characterized by the velocity ellipsoid , which reflects the mass distribution and evolution of the milky way , assuming that most of the detected stars are in equilibrium .",
    "the earliest study of the stellar velocity ellipsoid was done by @xcite . from then on",
    ", many works have found that the age of stars is correlated with the velocity distribution .",
    "specifically , older stars show larger velocity dispersion , and vice versa ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is usually thought to be because scattering of the disk stars increases over time .",
    "for the stars younger than @xmath218 gyr , the scattering is most likely due to encounters with substructures , e.g. , giant molecular clouds , in the disk @xcite . the age ",
    "velocity dispersion relation ( avr ) reflects the evolution history of the galactic disk .    in an ideal axisymmetric disk , the velocity ellipsoid near the disk mid - plane",
    "should be aligned with the cylindrical coordinates . however , since the galactic disk contains a rotational central bar and a number of spiral arms , the velocity ellipsoid will not match this ideal case . on the contrary",
    ", it deviates from the cylindrical coordinates near the galactic mid - plane .",

    "proper motion data is @xmath22 .",
    "* hereafter s12 ) confirmed that the vertex deviation of the metal - rich stars in the sdss sample is consistent with db98 .",
    "moreover , the authors also showed that the tilt angle relative to the galactic mid - plane is about @xmath23 to @xmath24 for the velocity ellipsoid at @xmath25 .",
    "recently , lots of new works have been done with the data from large stellar spectroscopic surveys , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite based on rave  @xcite , @xcite based on apogee  @xcite , and @xcite based on gaia - eso survey  @xcite .    since 2011 ,",
    "the lamost survey @xcite has been operating , and about 1 million stellar spectra with stellar parameters have been released in the dr1 catalog .",
    "a large fraction of these stars are located within 1@xmath26 around the sun , providing a vast resource to reveal details of the local stellar velocity distribution and give constraints on the dynamical structure and evolution of the galactic disk .    in this paper",
    ", we use the fgk type main - sequence stars selected from the lamost dr1 catalog to study the local velocity distribution .",
    "we use the effective temperature of these stars as a proxy for age and investigate the variation of the velocity distribution , including the mean velocity and the velocity ellipsoid , as a function of the effective temperature and height above / below the galactic mid - plane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe how we select the samples . in section 3 , we introduce a velocity de - projection method to reconstruct the velocity and velocity ellipsoid in three dimensions from only the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the method is then validated with gcs data and a mock catalog .",
    "the systematic biases due to the uneven spatial sampling and the spatial variation of the velocity ellipsoid are then calibrated .",
    "the mean velocities and velocity ellipsoids in various effective temperature bins at different height is then derived and discussed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "finally , brief conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "lamost is a quasi - meridian reflecting schmidt telescope with an effective aperture of about 4 m and a field of view of 5@xmath27 , operated by the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences .",
    "it is a powerful instrument to survey the sky with the capability of recording 4000 spectra simultaneously @xcite . in its five - year survey plan",
    ", it will obtain a few millions stellar spectra in about 20,000 square degrees in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the lamost survey has internally delivered the first data release ( dr1 ) , which contains 2,204,860 spectra with a resolution of @xmath211800 covering a wavelength range of @xmath28 .",
    "the catalog contains 1,085,404 stellar spectra with estimated stellar atmospheric parameters as well as line - of - sight velocities .",
    "the distances to stars with estimated effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity are determined from isochrone fitting by  @xcite .",
    "they developed two techniques , chi - square and bayesian to estimate the absolute magnitude .",
    "the chi - square technique finds the best fit absolute magnitude which reaches the minimum of the chi - square * between the measured @xmath8 log@xmath29 , [ fe / h ] and the isochrone ones*. the bayesian technique , on the other hand , considers both the selection effect and the different stellar populations along different line of sight .",
    "they verified that the accuracies of the distance estimates derived from both techniques are @xmath30% .",
    "they also found that their method may underestimate the distance of the giant stars by about 20% , but for main - sequence stars * with @xmath31@xmath8@xmath32k , no correlation is found with @xmath8 , as presented in figure  [ fig : distresid]*. compared with the _ hipparcos _ data , they obtained fairly good distance estimates with scatter of only @xmath33% . considering that only the fgk main - sequence stars",
    "are used in this work , the accuracy of the distance is sufficient for the studies of the local stellar kinematics within about 1kpc .",
    "for such nearby stars , not significant difference is found between the two techniques .",
    "therefore , we adopt the distance estimates from the chi - square technique in this work .",
    "we select nearby fgk type main - sequence stars to investigate the kinematics of the solar neighborhood . in order to select main - sequence stars",
    "we define the selection criteria separately for stars with @xmath8  larger and smaller than 5250k . for the stars with @xmath8  higher than 5250k ( displayed by the blue dots in figure [ fig_teff_logg_a ] ) , the selection criteria are as follows :    * 5250@xmath34@xmath8@xmath347000 k , * @xmath35 ( 3.75 - 4.5)/(7000 - 5000)*(@xmath8 - 5000)+4.5 , * ( -@xmath8/500 + 14.1)@xmath36(-@xmath8/550 + 15.0 ) ,    where @xmath37 is the estimated absolute magnitude in @xmath38 band from carlin et al . for stars with @xmath8@xmath345250k ( presented by the red points in figure [ fig_teff_logg_a ] ) ,",
    "the criteria are as follows :    * 4000@xmath34@xmath8@xmath345250 k , * @xmath35 4.2 , * ( -@xmath8/700 + 11.0)@xmath36(-@xmath8/750 + 12.0 ) .    the criteria on @xmath39 and @xmath37 are empirically set to ensure that the selected stars are in the main - sequence . the criteria for higher @xmath8",
    "remove the possible sub - giant branch stars so that the rest of the warm main - sequence stars may better trace the young populations .",
    "the criteria for lower @xmath8  exclude the giant stars .",
    "we further select stars whose spectra have signal - to - noise ratio higher than 10 in the @xmath29 band , which is the most sensitive portion of the spectrum to the stellar parameters .",
    "we also select the stars within    * 100@xmath40500pc , * 7@xmath419kpc ,    adopting the position of the sun to be @xmath42 = ( 8 , 0 , 0 ) kpc . the stars within 100@xmath43 are not well observed in the lamost survey because most of these stars are too bright .",
    "therefore , we only select the stars with @xmath44pc . finally , a total of 209,316 fgk type main - sequence stars are selected after applying all above criteria .",
    "it is worthy to point out that this sample is significantly extended compare to the previous works ( db98 ; s12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "therefore , the statistics based on such a large sample may be substantially improved and the sample containing a wide range of effective temperatures allows us to map the detailed kinematics for variant spectral types . figure [ density_distri ] shows the distribution of the sample in the cartesian coordinate system with respect to the galactic center ( the top - left , top - right and bottom - left panels ) and the @xmath8  vs. @xmath13 plane ( the bottom - right panel ) .",
    "the five vertical dashed lines in the bottom - right panel divide the effective temperature into six bins , in which the stellar kinematics are determined separately in the later sections .",

    "the lamost catalog provides the radial velocity of each star with uncertainty of about 5@xmath7 @xcite . in order to investigate the systematics of the radial velocities ,",
    "we cross identify the lamost data with the apogee data released in sdss dr10 @xcite and find @xmath211000 common stars with good parameter estimates and velocity scatter smaller than 0.3@xmath7 ( which removes most multiple or variable stars ) from apogee and signal - to - noise ratio higher than 20 in the lamost spectra .",
    "the radial velocity derived from the lamost pipeline is slower by 5.7@xmath7 compared with apogee , as shown in figure  [ fig_lm_apo ] .",
    "the reason for this offset is unclear and is worthy of further investigation in future works . in this work",
    ", we simply add an additional 5.7@xmath7 to the lamost derived radial velocity to match the other survey data .",
    "* it is noted that the offset is weakly anti - correlated with @xmath8 , but no significant correlation with [ fe / h ]  and _ _ log__g .",
    "we further investigate whether the weak anti - correlation with @xmath8  changes our result in section  [ sect : sysbias]*.",
    "for most of the lamost data , the proper motions can be found from either ucac4  @xcite or ppmxl  @xcite catalog . however , because the purpose of this work is to derive the velocity ellipsoids , it requires accurate measurement of the uncertainties of the proper motions as well as the values themselves .",
    "unfortunately , after * tentatively measuring the three dimensional velocities and their ellipsoids with the combination of the proper motions and the radial velocity * , we find that the errors of these proper motions are too large to derive the reliable velocity ellipsoids",
    ". therefore , we turn to measure the three dimensional velocity and its ellipsoid from only the one dimensional line - of - sight velocities of the lamost sample spanning a large area of the sky . in this section ,",
    "we first describe the velocity de - projection method and then discuss the validation and calibration of the approach .",
    "consider a star with the line - of - sight unit vector @xmath49 and heliocentric velocity of @xmath50 . the observed line - of - sight velocity @xmath51",
    "can be written as @xmath52 @xmath53 is determined by the galactic coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the three components of @xmath50 in the galactocentric cartesian coordinates are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively",
    ". then equation  ( [ eq : vproj ] ) can be expanded as @xmath57 given a group of stars at similar distance along the line of sight @xmath53 , the velocity dispersion projected onto the line of sight should be @xmath58 where n is the number of the stars .",
    "this can be specified as @xmath59 where the dispersions @xmath14 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 specify the size and shape of the velocity ellipsoids , and the cross terms @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoids .      according to equations [ v_los ] and [ sigma_los ] ,",
    "one is able to reconstruct the 3-d mean velocity and velocity ellipsoid at a given spatial position from the line - of - sight velocities of a group of stars located at the same position .",
    "to do this we construct a likelihood as the following @xmath65\\bigg\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the measured line - of - sight velocity of @xmath67th star , @xmath68 * is * the measured error of the line - of - sight velocity , @xmath69 and @xmath70 * are * the predicted mean line - of - sight velocity and the projected velocity dispersion along the line - of - sight of the @xmath67th star , respectively .",
    "the following 9 quantities , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath14 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are free parameters in equation  ( [ likelihood ] ) .",
    "the best fit values for them can be found by maximizing the likelihood @xmath71 .",
    "we use markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation to estimate the posterior probabilities of the velocities and the velocity ellipsoids .",
    "the priors of the three mean velocities , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , are evenly distributed in all real values , while the priors of the velocity ellipsoids are evenly distributed in the range of ( 0 , @xmath72 ) . in this work",
    ", we run the mcmc simulation with @xmath73 , which implements the affine - invariant ensemble sampler @xcite .",
    "the velocity de - projection technique has been applied by db98 , who used the proper motions of _ hipparcos _ to estimate the velocity and dispersions of stars with median distance of @xmath2170pc around the sun .",
    "later , @xcite applied the similar method to the sdss data , which extends to a few hundred parsecs away from the sun .",
    "however , @xcite then pointed out that the de - projection technique may produce systematic bias in the cross terms , especially in @xmath63 , if @xmath74 is a function of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . because our method is very similar to that db98 used and our data is located between 100 and 500pc in @xmath13 , we may also suffer from similar biases .",
    "furthermore , unlike the _ hipparcos _ data , the highly uneven spatial distribution of the lamost data may lead to another systematic bias .",
    "therefore , before applying this method to the lamost data , we need to carefully validate it and understand these issues .",
    "our first validation uses data from the geneva - copenhagen survey ( gcs ; * ? ? ? * ) , which is a volume - complete set of f- and g - type stars within @xmath2140pc , and provides three dimensional velocity components for each individual star .",
    "this dataset does not extend to a large volume , hence it may not be severely affected by the systematic bias explained by @xcite . thus we expect that the de - projection method may give estimates close to the true values .",
    "a sub - sample of 3712 dwarf stars for the validation test is selected from gcs data with 5500 k@xmath34@xmath8@xmath346000 k , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "outliers beyond 4@xmath74 in the line - of - sight velocity distribution are removed .",
    "only the line - of - sight velocity of these data is used to derive their mean velocities and velocity ellipsoid according to equation  ( [ likelihood ] ) via mcmc simulation . in order to reduce the effect of the uneven distribution on the sky , we separate the sky into small equal - area bins and randomly select roughly equal numbers of stars in each bin so that the samples are approximately evenly distributed on the whole sky .",
    "we repeat the arbitrary draw of the data in equal - area bins 40 times and estimate the velocity and its ellipsoid for each random drawing with mcmc .",
    "the final derived velocities and velocity dispersions are the averaged values over the 40 random draws .",
    "uncertainties on the velocities and their dispersions are composed of two parts : ( i ) the internal error from the mcmc ; and ( ii ) the external error due to the selection of the sample .",
    "the total uncertainties of the derived values are the square root of the quadratic sum of the two parts .",
    "we compare the best fit values with the true values directly measured from the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 of the individual stars ( see table [ tab_gcs])and find that the derived velocities and the ellipsoid are in good agreement with the true values .",
    "this confirms that the de - projection method can re - construct the 3-d kinematics for the stars within a very local volume .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      although the volume of our sample at @xmath80pc does not exactly overlap with that of the sample of db98 , which only extends to 70pc , we will compare our sample to that of db98 under the assumption that the velocity dispersions do not largely change from @xmath81100 to 300pc .",
    "the color index @xmath82 used by db98 can be converted into effective temperature according to @xcite .",
    "specifically , the data at around @xmath83 ( the color index bin 4 in db98 ) corresponds to @xmath8@xmath84k , the data at around @xmath85 ( bin 6 in db98 ) corresponds to @xmath8@xmath86k , the data at around @xmath87 ( bin 7 in db98 ) corresponds to @xmath8@xmath88k , and the data at @xmath89 ( bin 9 in db98 ) corresponds to @xmath8@xmath90k .",
    "because db98 did not directly show the dispersions along the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 directions , but showed the dispersions along the major axis of the velocity ellipsoids and the ratio of the major axis to the middle and minor axis , we also rotate the velocity ellipsoid showing in table  [ tab_sigma2b ] and find the longest , middle , and shortest axes of the derived ellipsoids to compare with db98 .",
    "table  [ tab : comparedb98 ] shows the comparison of the largest velocity dispersion @xmath91 and the two ratios of @xmath92 and @xmath93 between db98 and this work . in most cases ,",
    "the velocity dispersions with roughly the same @xmath8  are slightly larger in our data than those in db98 by up to @xmath10@xmath7 .",
    "this is reasonable since the height of the data in this work is slightly larger than those in db98 .",
    "it also shows that the ratio @xmath92 derived in this work is on average consistent with db98 , while @xmath93 is slightly smaller than db98 . in other words , compared with db98 , the velocity ellipsoid in this work is slightly broader in the @xmath76 direction , which is probably because the lamost data extend over a larger range in @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the errors in axis ratios are larger in this work .",
    "these errors may be overestimated because they are propagated from the large errors in the cross terms via the rotation transforms , rather than deriving directly from the observed data .     slice . ]     and tilt angle @xmath94 in various effective temperature bins at each @xmath13 slice . ]",
    "surprisingly , for the stars located at @xmath80pc , the vertex deviation is around zero for all @xmath8  bins .",
    "this is inconsistent with the results in db98 .",
    "first , it is noted that sections  [ sect : gcsvalid ] and  [ sec_mock ] have shown that the cross terms of the velocity ellipsoids are the easiest affected in the velocity de - projection method , as @xcite have stated .",
    "both the method in db98 and in this work are based on the velocity de - projection .",
    "therefore , both the results of the vertex deviation are possibly affected by systematic bias . because db98 de - projected the velocity components from the tangental velocities measured from proper motions ,",
    "while we derive them from the line - of - sight velocities , the systematic bias in both works may go toward different directions .",
    "second , even though we have calibrated the velocity ellipsoid , the corrected @xmath63 may still slightly bias from their true values ( see the top - right panels of figure  [ fig_mock1 ] ) .",
    "as a consequence , it is quite hard to compare the vertex deviation between this work and db98 .",
    "this issue can not be easily solved until the 3 dimensional velocities of stars are provided .",
    "b14 analysed the kinematics of @xmath21400 000 rave stars , and decomposed the sample into hot and cold dwarfs , red - clump and non - clump giants . for each of these classes",
    ", b14 provided an analytic model for the velocity ellipsoid at each point in the ( r , z ) plane . with the help of this model , we compared the velocity dispersions between b14 and this work .",
    "table  [ tab : compareb14 ] shows the comparison of the largest velocity dispersion @xmath91 and the two ratios of @xmath92 and @xmath93 between b14 and this work in the different layers .",
    "the @xmath91 , @xmath91/@xmath95 , and @xmath91/@xmath96 between the two works are in good agreement with each other within 1@xmath74 for most cases .",
    "however , for stars with @xmath8@xmath9k and @xmath97 and those with @xmath8@xmath12 and @xmath98 , the two works have differences by about 2-@xmath74 .",
    "it is not easy to compare the dispersions with s12 since they separate the data into metallicity bins rather than temperature or color index .",
    "moreover , most of the data in s12 are at heights larger than 500pc , which does not overlap with our data . however , a qualitative comparison is still worthwhile since s12 directly used three velocity components to derive the velocity ellipsoids .",
    "first , we compare the velocity dispersions at @xmath98pc and @xmath8@xmath99k ( see table  [ tab_sigma2b ] ) with the data at @xmath100  [ fe / h ]  @xmath101 and @xmath102kpc in s12 , which have @xmath103@xmath7 , @xmath104@xmath7 , and @xmath105@xmath7 , and find that they agree with each other .",

    ", this systematic underestimation likely occurs in all @xmath8  bins and consequently can not be the reason for the opposite trend along @xmath13 for the stars with @xmath8@xmath9k .      vs. age plane for the main - sequence stars based on the chabrier imf @xcite and the synthetic stellar isochrones @xcite .",
    "the color codes the normalize stellar distribution and the blue thick line indicates the mean age as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the separation of the @xmath8  bins in this work . ]",
    "we reveal that the kinematic features for the stars with @xmath8@xmath9k are significantly different from those for the cooler stars . in this section",
    ", we first give a theoretical estimation of the age@xmath8  relation and then we discuss the possible reasons why the kinematic features are so different for the stars with @xmath8@xmath9k based on the age distribution in next section .    in order to derive the age@xmath8  relation ,",
    "we first need to know the star formation history of the milky way .",
    "we adopt the star formation history shown in figure  1 of @xcite , which contains a star formation peak at about 11gyr age and a star formation rate decreasing with time ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : teff_age ] ) .",
    "second , we use synthetic isochrones @xcite to select the range of @xmath8  for the main - sequence stars at given age .",
    "we also adopt the initial mass function derived by @xcite to assign weight for the main - sequence stars at different temperature . finally , we set up the stellar distribution in age vs. @xmath8  plane , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : teff_age ] .",
    "the blue thick line shows the mean age at different @xmath8 .",
    "it shows that for the stars with @xmath152@xmath8@xmath32k , the mean age is between 2 and 3gyr and there are almost no stars with age larger than 4gyr . for the stars with @xmath153@xmath8@xmath154k , the average age varies between 3 and 6gyr . for the stars with @xmath8@xmath12k ,",
    "the average age is around 8gyr with a very broad range covering all ages .",
    "however , since the star formation rate has a peak at around 11gyr , the stars with age older than 8gyr dominate this region .",
    "the @xmath8  of the abrupt change in age is perfectly consistent with that of the sudden change in the mean velocity and velocity dispersions shown in the left and middle panels of figure  [ fig_uvw_teff_az ] .",
    "this implies that the parenago discontinuity occurs at around 6gyr .",
    "this value is about 3 gyr earlier than the result by @xcite .",
    "similar asymmetric motion is also reported in other works .",
    "@xcite found both the vertical and radial velocities are not at around zero with the lamost data .",
    "although the data analyzed by them are located in a larger volume than the data we use in this work , they are qualitatively consistent with the kinematic features of the young stars in our samples .",
    "@xcite also found similar trends in the solar vicinity with the red clump stars observed by rave @xcite .",
    "particularly , they found a faster @xmath139 ( see their figure 10 ) , a negative @xmath138 ( see their figure 12 ) , which is equivalent with a net positive @xmath54 in the cartesian coordinates , and slightly positive @xmath155 ( see their figure 13 ) at the position close to the galactic mid - plane .",
    "although the quantitative comparison is quite difficult since the spectral types of the stars in @xcite are completely different and the spatial sampling is also different , the orientations and the values of the offsets in three dimensional velocity are quite similar to our results . in general ,",
    "red clump stars are thought to be quite young and @xcite argued that the peak of the age of nearby red clump stars is only around 1gyr .",
    "then , it is not surprising that similar asymmetric motion is found in the red clump samples and the younger stars from our data set .",
    "there are possibly three channels to explain the unusual asymmetric motions for the young stars .",
    "we discuss these three scenarios here separately .",
    "first , if the young stars are still not completely relaxed , they may keep the peculiar motion of the molecular cloud in which they are born .",
    "assume that the young stars are formed in a giant molecular cloud containing totally @xmath156 - 1@xmath157 new formed stars within a scale of @xmath21200pc , then the relaxation time for the group of stars is between 0.5 - 4gyr .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : teff_age ] , for the youngest stars with @xmath8@xmath158k , even the maximum age is only @xmath159gyr .",
    "therefore , it is possible that these young stars are still not completely relaxed and still display some kinematic features of their birth place .",
    "second , it is likely that the young stars are perturbed by the non - axisymmetric structure in the disk , e.g. , the central rotating bar , spiral arms etc .",
    "some studies have argued that the perturbation must affect both young and old stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in general , orbits of stars in nearly circular orbits and very close to the galactic mid - plane can be approximated by three harmonic oscillations in azimuthal , radial , and vertical orientations .",
    "subsequently , the relatively fixed frequencies of the oscillations make the stars more easily respond to the resonance induced by the rotating bar or spiral arms .",
    "since young stars are mostly in near - circular orbits and concentrated in the mid - plane , they are more easily perturbed by non - axisymmetric structures than the old stars .",
    "however , the bar and spiral structures are mostly in the galactic mid - plane and thus may not affect the vertical motion of the young stars ( though see @xcite for some mechanisms by which the bar and spiral arms can vertically perturb the disk ) .",
    "therefore , it is hard to explain why the young stars also show a net positive value in @xmath56 .    finally , the disk may have been perturbed by a merging event .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite found that the stellar vertical density shows wave - like features , which could be the density wave excited by a minor merger @xcite .",
    "certainly , none of the scenarios discussed above can be easily ruled out .",
    "further observational and theoretical works are required to better address this challenging issue .",
    "an interesting question raised here is why previous studies of local kinematics based on the _ hipparcos _ data do not show the asymmetric motion .",
    "it is quite hard to answer it .",
    "the different volume of the _ hipparcos _ may be one reason .",
    "more detailed investigations with the future gaia data including accurate distance estimates as well as the 3-d velocities @xcite may be needed to complete the picture of local disk kinematics .",
    "* although figure  [ fig : distresid ] does not show any dependance of the distance estimates on @xmath8 , some extreme tests , e.g. , the distance is only over- or under - estimated for the warmer stars but unchanged for the cooler ones , are very helpful to verify whether the kinematic results are robust * , the left and middle panels of figure  [ fig_20p ] show the mean velocities derived from the distances with artificial 20% over- and under - estimation * only for the stars with @xmath8@xmath9k * , respectively .",
    "essentially , the asymmetric motions of the young stars still exist in both @xmath160  and @xmath11  * with slightly shifted values*. and the parenago s discontinuity and turnover phenomenon in @xmath112  are still substantial .",
    "we also do not find any systematic bias due to the over- or under - estimation of the distance in the velocity ellipsoids .",
    "* figure  [ fig_lm_apo ] presents a weak anti - correlation between the offset of the radial velocities and @xmath8 . *",
    "this drives us to further investigate whether the results are stable when the offset varies * with @xmath8*. we then * fit the offset of the radial velocity with a linear function of @xmath8  and correct the radial velocities for the individual stars with the @xmath8-independent offset .",
    "we find * that this leads to slightly shifts in @xmath160 , @xmath112 , and @xmath11 , as shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig_20p ] .",
    "* although the difference in @xmath160  between the young and old stars is vanished , the differences in @xmath112  and @xmath11  are even stronger .",
    "* it may also shift the derived local motion of the sun . for @xmath1 , it may decrease by @xmath161@xmath7 , and for @xmath3",
    ", it may increase by @xmath161@xmath7 .",
    "these shifts are within 1-@xmath74 uncertainties according to table  [ tab : lsr ] .",
    "* we also notice that @xcite found that the offset is 3.8@xmath7 compared the lamost data with pastel catalog  @xcite , implying that the calibration of the redial velocity may also depends on different calibrators .",
    "we did another test with the offset of 3.8@xmath7 and found the mean velocities shift by @xmath161@xmath7 for all stars and the systematic differences between the young and old stars are unchanged .",
    "therefore , in order to keep simplification , we adopt the correction of the radial velocity with a constant 5.7@xmath7 for all stars in this work . according to the tests with various corrections , we conclude that the difference in @xmath112  and @xmath11  between the young and old stars are real , while the mild difference in @xmath160  shown in figure  [ fig_uvw_teff_az ] may be insignificant . *",
    "we use the nearby fgk type main - sequence stars selected from lamost dr1 data to estimate the three dimensional velocities and velocity ellipsoids from line - of - sight velocities alone .",
    "it has been known that the velocity de - projection technique can introduce systematic bias due to the spatial variation of the velocity dispersions .",
    "moreover , we find that the uneven spatial sampling can also affect the velocity dispersion as well . in order to derive the corrected velocity ellipsoid from the de - projection method",
    ", we calibrate it using a set of transform matrices estimated from simulations .",
    "the calibration works well in the simulations and then is applied to the observed data .",
    "we associate the derived velocities and their ellipsoids with the effective temperature and @xmath13 and reveal that the asymmetric motions of the stars in the solar neighborhood reported by previous works are mainly seen among warm stars with @xmath8@xmath9k , which are very young with average age of less than 4gyr .",
    "these young stars rotate faster in larger @xmath13 than in smaller @xmath13 .",
    "* meanwhile , they move up toward the north galactic pole by about 3@xmath7 and probably radially inward to the galactic center by a few @xmath7*. the nature of the asymmetric motion is still not clear . with the older ( cool ) stars , we give estimates of the solar motion with respect to the lsr .",
    "we obtain ( @xmath162 , @xmath151 , @xmath163)@xmath164(9.58@xmath1652.39 , 10.75@xmath1651.96 , 7.01@xmath1651.67)@xmath7 .",
    "we also derive the velocity ellipsoids and find that the young stars have significantly smaller dispersions than the older stars .",
    "the vertical gradient of the velocity dispersions is larger in @xmath15 and @xmath16 than in @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath17 shows clear correlation with @xmath8  but the other two dispersions do not .",
    "we confirm that the parenago discontinuity occurs at about 6gyr by comparing the velocity dispersions with a simple star formation model .",
    "the derived velocity ellipsoids in this work are essentially consistent with those in db98 , s12 , and b14 .",
    "the velocity de - projection method may still slightly suffer from the distortion in the derived cross terms even after calibration .",
    "therefore , more accurate estimations about the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid should be done with three dimensional velocities .",
