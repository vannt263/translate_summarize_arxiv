    "pair production in such overcritical field may occur due to several reasons , e.g. heating @xcite or gravitational collapse of the compact object . assuming existence of such overcritical electric field in this paper we revisit the issue of conversion of energy from initial electric field into electron - positron plasma once the blocking is released .    the most general framework for considering the problem of back reaction of created matter fields on initial strong electric field is qed .",
    "up to now the problem has been treated in qed in 1 + 1 dimension case for both scalar @xcite and fermion @xcite fields .",

    "looking at the numerical values we observe how this anisotropy decreases with the increase of the initial electric field , which points out how an eventual approach toward isotropy , and therefore thermalization , would be much more difficult for lower initial fields .    in tab .",

    "now we turn to the dynamics of our system on much larger time scales .",
    "as discussed above , in long run interactions between created pairs become important .",

    "the larger the electric field the higher the rate of pairs production and consequently their number density .",
    "since the interaction rate is proportional to particle number densities , we expect them to be important sooner for higher initial field . in this respect",

    "there , it was found that @xmath80 decreases when the initial electric field increases .",
    "besides , the order of magnitude of their estimations is in agreement with the time at which the photons number density is around a few percent of the pairs number density .    in the previous subsection dedicated to collisionless systems , we described the anisotropy of the pairs df by means of the mean squared value of parallel and orthogonal momentum reported in tab .",

    "the extension of the grid was chosen in such a way that the value of each df at the grid boundaries was small compared to the maximum value .",
    "for the reason that interactions redistribute particles in the phase space and tend to isotropize their distributions , the orthogonal grid must be extended to values comparable to the kinetic equilibrium temperature . to do that , we use initially an orthogonal grid with the same extension as in the collisionless system .",

    "in particular , for the largest field @xmath97 we obtained almost 30 per cent of the thermal number density of pairs when the interactions are not yet important .",
    "it is interesting that the energy stored in initial electric field is mainly converted into internal and kinetic energies of pairs , but the former becomes predominant as time advances . even if the distribution in momentum space reminds maxwellian , also at the very beginning it is highly anisotropic , with the dispersion along the direction of electric field exceeding orders of magnitude that in orthogonal direction .",
    "we conclude that simultaneous production of pairs and their acceleration in the same electric field is responsible for such peculiar form of df of particles .",
