    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has discovered luminous quasars at redshifts as high as @xmath3 , i.e. , when the universe was only a billion years old .",
    "the super - massive black - holes ( smbh ) powering these quasars have been estimated to have masses of @xmath4 solar masses .",
    "there is evidence that smbhs contained a larger fraction of the host bulge mass at high redshift ( merloni , rudnick & di matteo  2004 ; shields , salviander , bonnin  2006 ; peng et al .",
    "there are , however , several other questions regarding the galaxies that host these high redshift quasars , and the physics that govern their evolution that have remained largely unanswered .",
    "traditionally , investigation of the evolution of high redshift quasars has revolved around construction of models for the luminosity function which can be compared with observation . in this way",
    "successful models can be labeled as possible candidates to explain the formation and evolution of the quasars .",
    "an equally valuable , though a rarer approach is to rule out potential models because they are unable provide an explanation for the observed population .",
    "this approach is important because while a successful model can only suggest a mechanism as one possibility , a model which does not reproduce an observed phenomena may be definitely ruled out .",
    "many successful models have been produced to explain the high redshift luminosity function ( e.g. haiman & loeb  1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ; volonteri , haardt & madau  2003 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ; di  matteo , croft , springel & hernquist  2003 ) .",
    "some authors advocate the view that the simpler a model the better because simple models can more clearly elucidate the important underlying physics .",
    "others would argue that more detailed numerical models that attempt to capture more of the complex non - linear processes involved offer a more realistic and reliable description .",
    "models for the luminosity function , therefore , take a variety of forms and complexity .",
    "these range from analytic models in which simple physical prescriptions are combined with the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function and merger rates ; to more complex semi - analytic models with merger trees and parameterised laws to describe physical processes ; through to numerical simulations with quasar activity included through a semi - analytic prescription .",
    "the published models of all types are broadly successful in their reproduction of high redshift number counts . in general this",
    "is because if one adds the number of free parameters to the number of physical assumptions , then one gets a number of parameters that is comparable to or smaller than the effective number of constraints ( which in practice includes only the slope of the luminosity function and the evolution of slope with redshift , in addition to the density normalisation ) .    in this paper",
    "we highlight the fact that many different models are able to reproduce the data on the high redshift quasar luminosity function , and note that this implies some degeneracy among input physical parameters or mechanisms .",
    "indeed , one such degeneracy was pointed out in an early model for high redshift quasar evolution ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ) . assuming that quasar number counts trace the number of dark - matter halo hosts , haehnelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the luminosity function at @xmath5 could be equally well described using a constant smbh to halo mass ratio combined with a constant lifetime ; or using a mass dependent smbh to halo mass ratio combined with a lifetime that decreased towards high redshift .",
    "the latter possibility is expected from a feedback scenario for smbh growth ( silk & rees  1998 ) .",
    "the degeneracy described above would imply that one can not obtain strong evidence for feedback using only the high redshift luminosity function data . more generally , these types of degeneracies mean that it is difficult to know which physical features of the various models are being constrained by the data .",
    "indeed we would like to know whether it is possible to conclude anything from published models other than the fact that the population of high redshift quasars can be reconciled with the @xmath6cdm cosmology .",
    "one feature that all models have in common is that they are based on the density and evolution of the dark - matter halo population . in semi - analytic models",
    "this population is generally modeled according to the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function ( with extensions ) .",
    "similar results are obtained in cases where cosmological n - body codes are used because the press - schechter mass function provides an accurate reflection of simulations over the mass - range of interest . in common with previous work",
    ", we use the press - schechter mass function as a starting point from which the quasar population is generated .",
    "however we do not attempt to model physical processes such as smbh growth and feedback etc .",
    ", as is done in traditional semi - analytic modeling . instead we take the more general approach of applying arbitrary parameterisations of processes like the evolution of quasar lifetime , and the evolution of the relation between smbh mass , halo mass and redshift . while it is true that we assign free parameters to describe processes that we do not understand , the procedure for finding _ sets _ of these parameters which satisfy the data in a statistical sense",
    "is fundamentally different from the usual procedure of semi - analytic modeling which aims to find a single successful model .",
    "we are interested in the full range of allowed parameters as well as which sets of parameters can be excluded , rather than in a single set of parameters that is able to describe the data . in this way",
    "we hope to provide guidance for future attempts to build physical models of smbh evolution .",
    "the optical quasar luminosity function shows a peak in its evolution at @xmath7 . at higher redshifts",
    "the quasar population grows with time , and it is natural to relate the rise of the quasar population to the rise of the dark - matter halo population ( e.g. haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; haiman & loeb  1998 ; volonteri , haardt & madau  2003 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ) .",
    "however near a redshift of @xmath7 the non - linear mass scale moves from galactic scale to cluster scale .",
    "it is thought that the rapid fall in the density of bright quasars below @xmath8 is due to a combination of a dwindling supply of cold gas at late times ( kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) with an injection of feedback from the quasars into the surrounding igm that prevents further gas accretion onto collapsing systems ( scannapiecco & oh  2004 ) .",
    "following the peak of quasar evolution one can no - longer relate the growth of the quasar ( or galaxy ) population directly to that of the dark - matter halo population in any direct or model independent way . for these reasons",
    "we restrict our attention to quasars at redshifts beyond @xmath9 , where we can relate the evolution in the quasar luminosity function directly to evolution of the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function .    in   [ params ]",
    "we introduce our parameterisation of smbh / quasar evolution , discuss the relation of these parameters to quasar observables , and present our method of parameter estimation as well as our choice of prior probabilities for the different variables .",
    "our approach is an extension of the formalism described in wyithe & padmanabhan  ( 2005 , hereafter paper - i ) . in  [ constraints ] and  [ lifetime ] we describe the constraints that the available data impose on physical and model parameters .",
    "the effects of scatter in the relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass and of the choice of parameterisation and prior probabilities are discussed in  [ scatter ] and  [ exp ] .",
    "finally we compare some simple physical models with our derived constraints (  [ compare ] ) before summarising our results in ",
    "[ conclusion ] . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the set of cosmological parameters determined by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , namely mass density parameters of @xmath10 in matter , @xmath11 in baryons , @xmath12 in a cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of @xmath13 .",
    "for the primordial power - spectrum of density fluctuations , we adopt a power - law slope @xmath14 , and the fitting formula to the exact transfer function of bardeen et al .",
    "in this section we introduce our parameterisation of smbh evolution .",
    "our aim is to describe a parameterised , rather than a physical , model of smbh evolution .",
    "we do not attempt to assign values for these parameters in order to represent a particular physical theory .",
    "rather our goal is to consider all values so as to elucidate the acceptable range of parameter values as well as any degeneracies .",
    "the parameterisation chosen provides a general set of models within which the various different possible physical models are contained .",
    "therefore by using this set of models to constrain the allowed values for these parameters , we may determine which physical processes can be unambiguously extracted from the available data .",
    "we define halo mass @xmath15 to be the mass of a halo hosting a quasar with a luminosity @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the relation between quasar luminosity @xmath18 and halo mass @xmath15 may have a mass dependence and a redshift dependence in addition to a normalisation ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we parameterise this dependence using two indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22    the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function @xmath23 , [ with the modification of sheth & tormen  ( 2002 ) that will be adopted throughout our discussion ] yields the number density @xmath24 of dark matter halos above some mass @xmath25 at redshift @xmath26 .",
    "if luminous quasars reside in a fraction @xmath27 of such dark - matter halos , then the observed number density of quasars is given by the product of two factors : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the ( unknown ) quasar lifetime and @xmath31 is the hubble time ( see e.g. , estathiou & rees  1998 ) .",
    "our fourth parameter is introduced via the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath32 . while @xmath27 could also change with @xmath26 due to various effects ( dust obscuration , beaming angle etc . )",
    ", we expect the dominant contribution to evolution in @xmath33 to come from @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless we allow for growth of @xmath27 with time .",
    "the evolution of @xmath33 can be parameterised by @xmath34 the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , in addition to @xmath36 therefore govern the evolution of smbhs . in this paper",
    "our goal is to constrain the allowed values of these parameters using observations of high redshift quasars .",
    "( note that the model described above assumes an arbitrarily chosen a power - law parameterisation .",
    "the effect of modifying this choice is investigated in  [ exp ] . )",
    "there are 3 observational constraints which we will use to identify the allowed range of parameters governing the evolution of smbhs ( @xmath35 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) as well as halo mass @xmath15 .",
    "let us discuss key observations that constrain these .",
    "first , observations of high redshift quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2001;2003;2004 ) reveal an exponential decline in the quasar population with redshift of the form @xmath37 suggesting approximate constancy of @xmath38 . as a measure of the rate at which luminous quasars appear , we therefore use the exponential slope @xmath39 of @xmath40 , which according to the above parameterisation",
    "is defined as @xmath41    second , observations of high redshift quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) also reveal a power - law decline in the density of quasars per unit luminosity as a function of luminosity of the form @xmath42 as a measure of the relative numbers of quasars with different luminosities at a single redshift we use the power - law slope of @xmath23 @xmath43 the factor of @xmath44 accounts for the nonlinear relation between luminosity and halo mass .",
    "third , the ratio of smbh to host dark - matter halo mass is determined locally .",
    "given a smbh to host dark - matter halo mass ratio @xmath45 at high redshift , we can compute an extrapolated ratio at @xmath46 for halos of mass @xmath47 using the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath48 if we estimate the smbh mass powering the high redshift quasars , then we can calculate @xmath45 for a given value of host mass @xmath15 and compare the extrapolated value of @xmath49 for halos of @xmath50 at @xmath46 with the observations .",
    "in this paper we assign gaussian probabilities for the observed distributions of @xmath38 , @xmath51 and @xmath49 . in paper - i ,",
    "based on the data of fan et al .",
    "( 2001;2003;2004 ) we found that @xmath52 is well constrained with a mean @xmath53 and variance @xmath54 .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2002 ) determines the ratio @xmath57 for @xmath58 and finds a significant dependence on the assumed mass - profile , with values ranging between @xmath59 ( for an nfw profile ) and @xmath60 ( for an singular isothermal profile ) .",
    "since the true profile is likely to lie between these extremes , we adopt a mean of @xmath61 and a variance @xmath62 .      from bayes theorem ,",
    "the joint a - posteriori probability distribution for the parameters of interest ( @xmath35 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath15 ) as well as @xmath63 is @xmath64 in what follows we will consider both the prior and observed constraints for @xmath20 , hence the designation @xmath65 in equation  ( [ d4p ] ) . since @xmath63 has an observed distribution , we may marginalise over its dependence @xmath66 the likelihoods in equation  ( [ d4p ] ) for @xmath38 and @xmath51 are @xmath67    in what follows we will consider both the case in which the constraint of the smbh - halo mass ratio is not included , ( so that @xmath68 ) , and the case in which the constraint of the smbh - halo mass ratio is included .",
    "in the later case ( which requires an assumption about the smbh mass ( @xmath69 ) , and extrapolation of equation  ( [ bhev ] ) between @xmath46 and @xmath0 ) , we have @xmath70 where we have marginalised over a prior dependence on smbh mass powering the high redshift quasars .      in this section",
    "we specify the prior probability distributions ( @xmath71 ) for parameters under investigation . in cases",
    "where parameters are independently constrained we present our representation of the observed distribution ( @xmath72 ) .    the value of @xmath38 is independent of the magnitude of the unknown quasar lifetime .",
    "however in addition to the halo mass , the value of @xmath38 depends on the form of the redshift _ evolution _ of @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath32 is handled by using the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "the expected range of @xmath74 may be set by the following considerations .",
    "first , if the quasar lifetime is determined by the mass @xmath75-fold timescale of the smbhs , then @xmath30 is independent of redshift , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "second , if the quasar lifetime is determined by the dynamical timescale at @xmath26 , then @xmath78 making @xmath33 independent of redshift and @xmath79 .",
    "( this is also true if @xmath80 . )",
    "the evolution of the parameter @xmath33 also depends on the evolution of @xmath81 .",
    "we expect the value of @xmath27 to grow with time , hence @xmath82 .",
    "thus the evolution of @xmath33 is parameterised according to @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "we take the prior probability for @xmath35 to be flat over a wide range of values @xmath85    in addition , the value of @xmath38 depends on the evolution of the relation between luminosity and halo mass ( @xmath21 ) . in paper - i",
    "we have shown that @xmath86 under the assumption of constant @xmath27 , by rejecting the null - hypothesis that @xmath87 .",
    "there are two components of the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "first , the smbh to halo mass ratio can vary with redshift ( a dependence described by a parameter @xmath88 ) .",
    "second the accretion rate could vary with redshift ( a dependence which we describe by a parameter @xmath89 ) . since the accretion rate is close to eddington at high redshift ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ) , we expect @xmath90 .",
    "the combined evolution of the quasar luminosity to halo mass ratio may then be described by @xmath91 .",
    "feedback scenarios at constant accretion rate imply @xmath92 .",
    "we use the following broad prior - probability distribution for @xmath21 which includes these values .",
    "@xmath93    the value of @xmath51 is independent of the unknown values of the quasar lifetime ( including its evolution @xmath35 ) as well as @xmath21 .",
    "however in addition to the halo mass , the value of @xmath51 depends on the form of the relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass ( @xmath20 ) . as before there are two components to @xmath20 .",
    "first , the smbh to halo mass ratio can vary with halo mass at fixed redshift ( a dependence described by a parameter @xmath94 ) .",
    "second the accretion rate at fixed redshift could vary with halo mass ( a dependence which we describe by a parameter @xmath95 ) . since the accretion rate is close to eddington in the most luminous high redshift quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ) , we expect @xmath96 .",
    "the combined evolution may then be described by @xmath97 locally , the smbh to halo mass relation is steeper than linear ( @xmath98 ) , while feedback driven scenarios at constant accretion rate , as well as observation prefer @xmath99 .",
    "we consider two cases for prior knowledge of @xmath20 .",
    "first , we use the following prior , which ignores externally derived constraints @xmath100 second , we assume that the accretion rate is insensitive to halo mass ( @xmath101 ) , so that at fixed redshift the smbh mass depends only on the halo mass .",
    "locally , direct estimates of smbh and host mass can be made through observations of galaxy dynamics .",
    "these observations reveal a correlation between smbh mass and the characteristic velocity of the surrounding stellar spheroid ( e.g. merritt & ferrarese  2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , and by extension of the host dark matter halo ( ferrarese  2003 ) .",
    "we therefore also consider the case where @xmath20 is hypothesised to be redshift independent so that the observed constraint can be applied at high redshift . in this case",
    "we take @xmath102 with a mean and variance of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "comparison of the high redshift smbh to halo mass ratio with the ratio expected by extrapolating the local value to high redshift requires an assumption about the smbh mass .",
    "smbhs powering the highest redshift quasars are believed to have masses of @xmath105 ( fan et al .",
    "we consider the following prior probability for the smbh mass ( @xmath69 ) powering the high redshift quasars .",
    "@xmath106    of course , all constraints depend on the value of @xmath36 .",
    "smbhs powering the highest redshift quasars are though to have masses in excess of @xmath107 , implying halo masses of @xmath108 .",
    "galaxies are not observed to have halos in excess of @xmath109 .",
    "hence we choose a prior probability for @xmath110 of the form @xmath111    finally , the evaluation of the ps mass - function , and hence of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath51 depend on the adopted cosmology , with the greatest dependence being on @xmath63 .",
    "we utilise the observed distribution for @xmath63 from _ wmap _ ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath112 with mean and variance of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in this section we present a - posteriori , joint probability distributions for combinations of @xmath35 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath36 .",
    "these distributions were obtained by marginalising equation  ( [ d3p ] ) over the other parameters .",
    "for example the joint probability for @xmath21 and @xmath115 may be found from @xmath116 we also determine a - posteriori cumulative probability distributions for individual parameters .",
    "for example , the cumulative probability for @xmath115 is @xmath117    we show results in 3 different cases :    * case - i : we begin by determining the constraints that can be made considering only the limits on @xmath38 and @xmath51 derived from the sdss quasars , i.e. @xmath68 and assumption only of the prior probability ( equation  [ deltaprior ] ) for @xmath20 . in this case",
    "we are trying to determine 4 parameters from two constraints , and so are strongly under - constrained .",
    "* case - ii : we next determine the constraints that can be made considering the limits on @xmath49 in addition to those on @xmath38 and @xmath51 , thus @xmath118 is given by equation  ( [ lr ] ) .",
    "as in case - i , we assume a flat prior probability ( equation  [ deltaprior ] ) for @xmath20 .",
    "the addition of the third constraint partially breaks the degeneracies in case - i .",
    "* case - iii : finally we replace the prior probability ( equation  [ deltaprior ] ) for @xmath20 , with the distribution observed locally ( equation  [ deltaobs ] ) .",
    "results are presented in figures  [ fig1]-[fig3 ] for cases - i  iii respectively .",
    "the sets of panels in the upper two rows show contours of @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . for the display of joint probability distributions ,",
    "the solid , dashed , dot - dashed and dotted contours correspond to values that are 0.61 , 0.26 , 0.14 and 0.036 times the distributions peak value , whose position is marked by a dot . when applied to a gaussian distribution ,",
    "these values correspond to the 1 , 2 , 3 and 5-sigma levels respectively .",
    "we also show a - posteriori cumulative probability distributions for individual parameters in the lower rows of figures  [ fig1]-[fig3 ] ( dark lines ) together with the corresponding prior probability distributions ( light lines ) .    for each case we determine the values corresponding to the maximum likeli - hood solution normalised with respect to a maximum possible value of unity .",
    "maximum likeli - hoods of order unity imply that the model is able to accommodate all constraints simultaneously .",
    "the values corresponding to the maximum likeli - hood solution are shown in figures  [ fig1]-[fig3 ] ( large crosses ) . for case - i the maximum value of the likelihood is given by @xmath125 . for case - ii",
    "we include the constraint of local mass ratio so that the likeli - hood becomes @xmath126 .",
    "finally the addition of prior information on the parameter @xmath20 leads to a maximum value for the likelihood in case - iii of @xmath127 .",
    "we consider each case in turn :    _ case - i : _ in the first case we determine what can be learned regarding the connection between smbhs and host halos , using only the evolution in the number counts of quasars at high redshift and the slope of the high redshift quasar luminosity function .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . in this case",
    "we have two parameters that may be measured ( @xmath51 and @xmath38 ) but 4 model parameters that lack prior constraints .",
    "clearly this problem is under - constrained .",
    "inspection of equations  ( [ psslope ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) shows that @xmath51 depends only on @xmath15 and @xmath20 , while @xmath38 is a function of all four parameters .",
    "thus we would expect a degeneracy in the determination of parameters @xmath20 and @xmath15 which is driven by the observed luminosity function slope @xmath51 .",
    "this degeneracy is clearly seen in the center panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , although it is broken at high and at low @xmath15 by the additional constraints from @xmath38 .",
    "thus even in this under - constrained case we are able to obtain an estimate of mass , and show that @xmath98 .",
    "the preferred value for the parameter @xmath20 is quite insensitive to the value of either @xmath35 or @xmath21 .",
    "because the measured value of @xmath38 is degenerate between @xmath15 ( or @xmath20 through the constraint of @xmath128 , @xmath21 and @xmath35 , there will be a degeneracy along a line in the three dimensional parameter space . as a result",
    "we see that no constraints are possible in the @xmath129 plane , while there are strong degeneracies between @xmath35 and @xmath15 and between @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",

    "the lack of restriction imposed on models for smbh growth by the high redshift luminosity function may be clearly seen in the lower row of figure  [ fig1 ] . while the high redshift luminosity function places limits on each of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath15 ,",
    "no limits may be placed on the parameters @xmath35 or @xmath21 .",
    "additional observables must therefore be included in order to constrain the models .",
    "we next turn to inclusion of the likelihood based on the local smbh to halo mass ratio .",
    "_ case - ii : _ we can break part of the degeneracy seen in case - i by including the likeli - hood for the local smbh to halo mass ratio ( equation  [ lr ] ) as an additional constraint .",
    "this inclusion has a two - fold effect on the parameter fit .",
    "firstly , it couples the dependence of the overall likeli - hood of a solution on @xmath20 and @xmath21 in a direct way .",
    "the likelihood for the ratio @xmath132 will therefore be degenerate between @xmath20 and @xmath21 . secondly , the value of @xmath21 is now constrained by the likelihood for @xmath132 in addition to the likelihood for @xmath38 .",
    "this breaks the three - way degeneracy between @xmath15 , @xmath35 and @xmath21 .",
    "the interplay between the different likelihoods and parameters is now coupled so that simple interpretation of the solution is more difficult than in case - i .",
    "however we now have 3 observables ( @xmath38 , @xmath51 and @xmath132 ) , from which to constrain 4 parameters .",
    "the solution must therefore still be subject to a certain degree of degeneracy .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we find that the combinations of @xmath21 with @xmath15 , @xmath20 with @xmath15 and @xmath21 with @xmath20 are well constrained .",
    "in particular we find @xmath86 .",
    "this may also be seen by inspecting the a - posteriori cumulative probability distributions .",
    "we see that @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath115 have a - posteriori distributions that differ substantially from their prior probabilities , indicating that the data is able to constrain their values .",
    "the value of @xmath20 lies between 1.1 and 1.6 ( 90% ) , and is larger than unity in agreement with the locally observed prior probability distribution for @xmath20 that will be included in case - iii .",
    "the mass is constrained to be larger than @xmath133 and smaller than @xmath134 ( 90% ) , while @xmath135 ( 90% ) .",
    "unless the accretion rate is changing rapidly with redshift near @xmath136 , the positive value of @xmath21 implies a smbh to halo mass ratio that decreases with time .",
    "the main degeneracies due to the remaining degree of freedom are between @xmath35 and @xmath15 ( lower right ) , between @xmath35 and @xmath20 ( upper center ) and between @xmath35 and @xmath21 ( upper left ) , although the dependencies on @xmath35 are weak .",
    "the maximum value of the likelihood is @xmath137 , implying that the best fit model remains a very good fit to the data following the addition of the constraint on the mass ratio .",
    "the set of best fit parameters is @xmath138 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 remains at the edge of the range of parameter space , indicating that the degeneracies between @xmath35 and other parameters is not removed through the inclusion of the mass ratio .",

    "the results are plotted in the upper and central rows of figure  [ fig3 ] . strictly speaking the solution is still under - constrained since there are 4 parameters and three constraints .",
    "however the observed prior distribution for @xmath20 is sufficiently narrow that the hypothesis of the slope in the local relation ( @xmath20 ) also holding at high redshift strongly constrains the solution .",
    "the result is that both @xmath21 and @xmath15 are tightly constrained by the data .",
    "the maximum likeli - hood value is @xmath139 , with a set of best fit parameters @xmath140 . from the lower row of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we see that only @xmath21 and @xmath115 have a - posteriori distributions that differ substantially from their prior probabilities .",
    "the data does not restrict @xmath20 much beyond the assumed prior probability in this case .",
    "however this indicates that the preferred value of @xmath20 at @xmath136 is similar to the local value as hypothesised . as in case - ii the data shows a definite preferred solution for these quantities .",
    "smbhs form a smaller fraction of their hosts mass at early times than they do today , @xmath141 ( 90% ) , with high redshift host masses of @xmath142 ( 90% ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 remains unconstrained .",
    "if a fraction @xmath27 of dark matter halos contain smbhs , then the total lifetime of the quasar can be estimated ( martini & weinberg  2001 ; haiman & hui  2001 ) by dividing the quasar density @xmath143 by @xmath27 times the density @xmath144 of halos larger than @xmath15 , and then multiplying by the hubble time ( for @xmath145 ) , hence @xmath146 there is therefore a one to one correspondence between @xmath147 and @xmath15 . as a result the joint a - posteriori distribution , with @xmath15 replaced by @xmath148 may be obtained as @xmath149 where @xmath150^{-1}.\\ ] ]    in the third row of figure  [ fig3 ] we show the joint probability distributions ( computed using equation  [ d3ptq ] ) for @xmath35 and @xmath151 , @xmath21 and @xmath152 , and for @xmath20 and @xmath153 . the distributions were computed using case - iii constraints . the behavior is similar to that for the distributions of @xmath115 as expected . if the occupation fraction is of order unity , then we find lifetimes of @xmath154 years , in agreement with estimates at lower redshifts . observed",
    "quasar lifetimes therefore suggest an occupation fraction @xmath27 that is of order unity . since the hubble time is @xmath4 years at @xmath0 , we find that the occupation fraction must be larger than @xmath155@xmath156 .",
    "up till now we have assumed a one - to - one correspondence between halo mass and quasar luminosity ( equation  [ bhev ] ) .",
    "however we would expect a scatter in this relation , due to ( at least because of ) scatter in the @xmath157 relation , and due to variation in the accretion rate . to assess the importance of this scatter ,",
    "we make the following modification to the calculation already described . we have associated a quasar of luminosity @xmath18 with a halo of mass @xmath15 .",
    "we can regard the mass @xmath15 as characteristic , and replace the density of halos @xmath23 with an effective density @xmath158 which is obtained as a weighted average of the densities of halos that house a quasar of luminosity @xmath18 . here",
    "effective values of @xmath38 , @xmath21 etc .",
    "can then be calculated using @xmath160 .",
    "we have computed the resulting probability distributions for @xmath35 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath36 as before in order to assess the importance of scatter in equation  ( [ bhev ] ) .",
    "distributions corresponding to case - iii were computed taking @xmath161 ( so that 68% of halos are contained within 1 decade of mass ) , and are plotted in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the results are similar to those obtained in the absence of scatter .",
    "in particular the contours for distributions move by less than 1-sigma , and have quantitatively similar values .",
    "the maximum value of the likelihood is @xmath162 , implying that the best fit model remains a very good fit to the data following the addition of scatter in the smbh  halo mass relation .",
    "the set of best fit parameters is @xmath163 .",
    "in this paper our aim is to determine what physical properties may be inferred from the high redshift quasar luminosity function within a general , rather than a specific framework .",
    "two issues arise regarding the statistical robustness of our results .",
    "firstly , having chosen a particular parameterisation for our model we then calculate likelihoods for parameters using that parameterisation ( for example @xmath115 , @xmath21 and @xmath35 in our prescription ) .",
    "we have chosen flat prior probability distributions for these parameters and hence find aposteriori probabilities for their values .",
    "now if the observations are able to genuinely constrain the values of these parameters , then our results should be independent of the prior used ( within reason ) .",
    "we would therefore like to know whether our results are sensitive to the choice of prior .",
    "secondly , we have chosen a powerlaw parameterisation for the redshift dependencies of the lifetime and smbh to halo mass ratio .",
    "these parameterisations may or not provide an adequate description of reality .",
    "we would therefore like to know whether the choice of parameterisation affects our physical conclusions regarding the mass of host dark matter halos , or the evolution of the smbh to halo mass ratio .",
    "we discuss these issues in the remainder of this section .",
    "up till now we have assumed prior probability distributions for dimensionless parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 ) that are flat ( i.e. @xmath164 etc ) .",
    "for the dimensioned quantity ( @xmath15 ) we have assumed a prior probability that is flat in the logarithm [ i.e. @xmath165 . while these are the natural choices , we have repeated the calculations in case - ii assuming priors for @xmath21 and @xmath20 that are flat in the logarithm ( for @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) , and a prior probability @xmath168 , where @xmath169 for host halo mass .",
    "we have not changed the prior of the unconstrained parameter @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the resulting parameter constraints .",
    "the set of best fit parameters is @xmath170 .",
    "the constrained value for @xmath15 is quite similar to the original case ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , thus the estimate of this ( physical ) parameter would appear to be insensitive to the choice of prior .",
    "the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 also take similar values indicating that they are constrained by the data rather than by the prior .",
    "the conclusion that the smbh to halo mass ratio was larger in the past ( @xmath86 ) is therefore not sensitive to the choice of prior .",
    "the value of @xmath35 remains the least constrained , although positive values are preferred in this case .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath21 describe redshift dependencies of the lifetime and smbh to halo mass ratio respectively . up till",
    "now we have specified power - law evolutions for these quantities , and constrained the allowed values of the corresponding parameters .",
    "of course it is only our theoretical prejudice that leads us to specify a power - law , since we have no observational evidence for this form of parameterisation .",
    "the assumption of a particular prior probability distribution for a parameter ( bayes postulate ) leads to prior probabilities for the physical parameter of interest ( like the life - time or mass ratio ) that depend on the parameterisation employed .",
    "we would therefore like to check that our choice of model does not qualitatively bias the results . to check the effect of our choice of parameterisation",
    ", we have re - calculated our results assuming exponential rather than power - law evolution for those quantities that vary with redshift ( i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath171 ) .",
    "however we retain our power - law form for mass ratio at fixed redshift ( @xmath20 ) since this is an observed rather than a postulated parameterisation .",
    "thus equations  ( [ bhev ] ) and ( [ tauev ] ) become @xmath172 and @xmath173 which leads to evolution described by the equation @xmath174 the constraint from the local mass ratio ( equation  [ ratio ] ) becomes @xmath175 while the constraint based on the slope of the luminosity function ( equation  [ beta ] ) remains unchanged . note",
    "that the relation of @xmath38 to @xmath132 as a function of @xmath21 is altered by the new definition .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the resulting parameter constraints assuming the analysis described in case - iii .",
    "the constrained value for @xmath15 is quite similar to the power - law case ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , thus the estimate of this ( physical ) parameter would appear to be insensitive to the choice of parameterisation ( assuming a monotonic evolution over the range of interest ) . the maximum value of the likelihood is @xmath176 , implying that the best fit exponential model also provides a very good fit to the data .",
    "the set of best fit parameters is @xmath177 .",
    "the values of @xmath35 and @xmath21 will clearly differ from the power - law case .",
    "however the conclusion that the smbh to halo mass ratio was larger in the past ( @xmath86 ) holds in the exponential case as in the power - law case .",
    "the exponential parameterisation allows a preferred value of @xmath178 , indicating an occupation fraction and/or duty - cycle that does not vary much with redshift .",
    "before concluding , we apply our idea to a couple of simple test case models . among the successful models of the high redshift quasar luminosity function , two examples employ particularly simple but different physical hypotheses . in the first , the quasar lifetime is constant ( perhaps set by the salpeter time ) with an occupation fraction of unity , the smbh makes up a constant fraction of the host halo mass , and the quasar shines at its eddington rate ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; haiman & loeb  1998 ) .",
    "we refer to this as model - a . in the second model ,",
    "the smbh mass is set by feedback ( through energy conservation ) over the dynamical time of the gas reservoir , the occupation fraction is of order unity and",
    "the quasar shines at its eddington rate ( silk & rees  1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ) .",
    "we refer to this as model - b . in the present context",
    "these two models may be described by the parameter sets ( @xmath179,@xmath180,@xmath181)=(1.5,0,1 ) and ( @xmath182,@xmath183,@xmath184)=(0,2.5,1.66 ) respectively .",
    "the locations of these models in parameter space are shown in figures  [ fig1]-[fig5 ] by the the light dashed lines , and the letters * a * and * b*.    considering first the constraints in case - i ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , we see that the degeneracies prohibit any conclusion regarding @xmath35 or @xmath21 , while the preferred @xmath20 lies between the two models .",
    "indeed the two models may not be distinguished at all based on the luminosity function data alone . on the other hand",
    "the simple models described should also be able to accommodate the constraint from the local smbh to halo mass ratio . in case - ii ( figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] ) the different values of @xmath35 for the two models are again indistinguishable .",
    "however in contrast the values of @xmath21 and @xmath20 are more consistent with the feedback driven model ( model - b ) .",
    "finally , if the prior probability for @xmath20 is included ( case - iii , figures  [ fig3]-[fig4 ] ) then we have ruled out model - a a - priori .",
    "however in this final case it is still instructive to investigate the consistency of model - b with observation .",
    "the model - b values of @xmath185 and @xmath186 are consistent with the data .",
    "these results suggest that model - b is more consistent with the data than model - a .",
    "however it is interesting to note that the most likely values for the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 lie between those of the two models , indicating that neither describes the astrophysics in its totality .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrates in a model independent way , that the data would prefer a smbh to halo mass ratio that is larger at higher redshifts ( as suggested by the evolution of the virial - mass  virial - velocity relation ) , combined with a smbh to halo mass ratio that is larger in higher mass halos .",
    "these conclusions are insensitive to the addition of scatter in the luminosity  halo mass relation , to the form of parameterisation , and to the prior probabilities assumed .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the constraints that observations of the high redshift luminosity function place on smbh evolution .",
    "our approach differs from that traditionally employed . rather than hypothesise a physical model to govern the formation and evolution of smbhs",
    ", we have described a general parameterised model and determined the regions of the resulting parameter space that are admitted by the observations .",
    "the traditional approach allows one to demonstrate that a particular model is viable , but does not provide a test of its uniqueness , nor which aspects of the theory are constrained by the data .",
    "conversely our approach explicitly demonstrates the degeneracies among the evolution of different physical properties , and thus reveals which conclusions may be robustly drawn from the data .",
    "we find that in isolation , the available data for the luminosity function of high redshift quasars is unable to distinguish between a range of different physical models due to a series of degeneracies between different physical properties .",
    "the inclusion of the local smbh to halo mass ratio as a constraint removes some of this degeneracy and allows us to determine the physical parameters that may most clearly be derived from the data .",
    "we find that the mass of the high redshift quasar host halos was @xmath187 ( 90% ) .",
    "the ratio of smbh to halo mass was larger at high redshift with a dependence @xmath188 [ or @xmath189 ( 90% ) .",
    "in addition , the ratio of quasar luminosity to halo mass increases with halo mass .",
    "we find @xmath190 ( 90% ) . in the instance of an accretion rate that is insensitive to halo mass",
    "this relation is in agreement with that observed in the local universe . in hindsight",
    "the latter result might have been expected since the press - schechter mass function declines exponentially towards high redshift , while quasar number counts are observed to decline only as a power - law .",
    "these conclusions are not sensitive to scatter in the relation of smbh to halo mass , or to the choices of parameterisation or prior probabilities , and so must be implicit in any physical model developed to describe smbh evolution .",
    "however the evolution of lifetime and occupation fraction are not currently probed by the data .    in the future ,",
    "the analysis described in this paper will be enhanced by additional constraints . for example , a larger sample of quasars would allow the slope of the luminosity function @xmath51 and the evolution of quasar density @xmath38 to be determined over a range of redshifts .",
    "these additional constraints should break some of the remaining degeneracies and provide us with constraints on the evolution of quasar lifetime to go beside the current constraints available for the host halo mass .",
    "the authors thank zoltan haiman for helpful comments on a draft of this manuscript . the work of jsbw was supported by the australian research council .",
