    "it is now well understood that one of the coupled surface modes in a thin metal film ( long range surface plasmon ( lrsp ) ) , is associated with larger q - factor and field enhancement .",
    "some of the recent studies exploit such properties of lrsp to achieve modulation @xcite .",

    "efficient energy confinement and feasibility of short range interconnections with a plasmonic guide were shown both experimentally and by numerical computation @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest feasibility of using polymers for efficient modulators due to their ease of integration with several passive materials .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on a planar geometry of metal - dielectric - metal guides ( known as gap - plasmon guides ( gpw ) ) with sub - wavelength lateral dimension in order to show efficient electro - optic modulation .",
    "it is known that well confined plasmonic modes in the gpw geometry have longer propagation lengths @xcite .",
    "we use the plasmon single - mode regime of such a guide filled with an electro - optic polymer in between the two metal plates .",
    "it was shown earlier how the modes of the gpw could be used for slowing down light @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate how the same modes can , in principle , be used for achieving eom in attenuated total reflection ( atr ) or end - fire configuration .",
    "we show that the device is expected to lead to a large accumulation of phase .",
    "moreover , this phase is shown to be controllable by the applied modulating voltage via the refractive index dependence of the electro - optic polymer on the electric field .",
    "the end fire configuration is particularly interesting since in all probability , such is the way a guide is to excited .",
    "however , focusing to a spotsize less than 50 nm may pose a challenging problem . besides , the modulator may form a part of a usual communication system . keeping in view the aforementioned we use a standard 1.25@xmath0 m guide ( a model for the fiber )",
    "followed by a tapered region to the 50 nm guide ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "recently such a structure was investigated to probe the loss in the micro - to - nano interfacing and a loss of about 30% was reported @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the analytical treatment could be too cumbersome .",
    "hence we resort to numerical finite difference time domain scheme @xcite ( using the commercial product fullwave @xcite ) to analyze such a structure .",
    "we assume the polymer to be isotropic and the structure to have a zero insertion loss .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : atr ]",
    "we show how the sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance on the change of the core refractive index ( via the electro - optic effect ) can be used for intensity - modulation in reflection in atr geometry .",
    "the next section ( [ sec : results2 ] ) deals with the fdtd solution for the end - fire configuration .",
    "we summarize the important results in conclusions .",
    "it is now well understood that the modes of a planar metal - dielectric structure can be studied in the attenuated total reflection geometry , wherein the guiding structure is loaded on top by a high index prism ( figure [ fig : atr ] ) .",
    "the excitation of the guided and surface modes can be read out in the dips of the reflection coefficient for specific angles of incidence .",
    "the location of the dips is extremely sensitive to the guide parameters , the ambient medium refractive index and on the surface conditions .",
    "this sensitivity has been exploited to a great deal to realize plasmonic and waveguide sensors and electro - optic modulators ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we use the specifics of our gpw to show that similar ideas also hold ( as expected ) at sub - wavelength scales where the guide core width is reduced to about 50 nm .",
    "our gpw structure consists of an electro - optic polymer of width @xmath4 sandwiched between two identical gold layers of width @xmath5 ( figure [ fig : atr ] ) .",
    "the polymer is assumed to be isotropic for simplicity and therefore the change in dielectric permittivity ( @xmath6 ) can be written as ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electro - optic coefficient , @xmath9 is the applied electric field .",
    "we can further assume a flat response of @xmath6 over the range of working frequencies leading to @xmath10 thus the permittivity of the electro - optic polymer layer has been written down in terms of a dimensionless electric field amplitude ( @xmath11 ) where @xmath12 is the permittivity of the polymer layer without any applied voltage .",
    "( p@xmath13 ) shifts to lower ( higher ) effective index ( i.e. , smaller angle of incidence @xmath14 ) when the @xmath4 is decreased from @xmath15 ( dashed ) to @xmath16 ( solid ) .",
    "( b ) only a plasmonic mode is excited at @xmath17 ( below the cut - off for the guided modes ) .",
    "all plots correspond to tm polarization .",
    ", width=302 ]    the structure is excited by a monochromatic plane wave incident through a high index prism ( refractive index @xmath18 ) at an angle @xmath14 .",
    "the modes of such a gpw were studied in detail @xcite . below a certain cut - off the only mode that can survive in the structure",
    "is the plasmon mode , which can be excited only with p - polarized light .",
    "thus such a guide does not support ( at about @xmath1950 nm ) any s - polarized waves and essentially is a single mode device below this cut - off width at @xmath20 m .",
    "the calculation of the refraction coefficient for such layered media is fairly standard and we use the characteristic matrix technique to arrive at the magnitude of the intensity reflection coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "the results for @xmath21 as a function of the angle of incidence for applied field @xmath22 is shown in figure [ fig:2 ] for several values of the guide core thickness ( a ) 0.8@xmath0 m ( dashed ) , 0.6@xmath0 m ( solid ) and ( b ) 50 nm .",
    "other parameters are as follows : dielectric permittivities of the polymer guide , gold and high - index prism are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively and cladding thickness @xmath26 .",
    "we now study the change in the mode pattern due to the applied voltage and the corresponding change in the reflectivity .",
    "it is clear that with a change in the refractive index due to the change in the applied voltage , the resonance dip will get shifted .",
    "the effective index ( @xmath27 ) of a particular mode can be extracted by using the following relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the value of the angle of incidence where the dip occurs .",
    "the results for the effective index as a function of the normalized dc voltage is shown in figure [ fig : acdcresp](a ) .",
    "it is clear that an increase in the voltage reduces the core refractive index and hence the effective index .",
    "a 10% change in @xmath6 caused by the change in the voltage brings about a corresponding change in the effective index .     as a function of the applied field @xmath30 .",
    "the lowest , middle and upper curves corespond to the plasmonic mode at @xmath31 , @xmath32 and 50 nm , respectively .",
    "( b ) the ac response at @xmath33 with @xmath34 at 1khz .",
    "reflectivity of the gpw structure for @xmath35 at @xmath36 73.88@xmath37 ( solid ) , 72@xmath37 ( dash - dot ) and for @xmath380.01 at @xmath36 73.88@xmath37 ( dashed ) .",
    ", width=453 ]    the effect of an ac voltage on the intensity reflection can be dramatic , since such a voltage can take the systems to off resonance and again bring it back to resonance .",
    "this results in an oscillatory response in the reflectivity ( see figure [ fig : acdcresp](b ) )",
    ". the large values of reflectivity correspond to the case where the mode is not excited efficiently , while a low value implies efficient excitation of the guided / plasmon modes .",
    "these upper and lower bounds can be regulated by choosing the detuning from the surface surface plasmon resonance .",
    "one can thus regulate the efficiency of excitation of the guided / plasmon mode .",
    "these features are shown in figure [ fig : acdcresp](b ) , for @xmath33 with @xmath39 for @xmath40khz .",
    "we show such modulation in figure [ fig : acdcresp](b ) over two cycles of the applied ac field . we show this for two amplitudes of the applied field , namely , @xmath41 and 0.05 . at @xmath42 , @xmath43 the plasmonic mode",
    "is efficiently coupled into the sub - wavelength guide , that is , a good modulation depth is achieved . with @xmath42 , changing @xmath14 to @xmath44 (",
    "dashed ) decreases the modulation depth as is clear from the figure .",
    ") of the magnetic field component at the centre of the guide measured along the propagation direction for @xmath450.1 ( dashed ) and -0.1 ( solid ) . ,",
    "width=302 ]    our gpw structure , in practice , need to be interfaced with other components in an optical circuit .",
    "it is thus necessary to analyze our structure for the end - fire excitation .",
    "we consider coupling of the polymer guide to a standard 1.25@xmath0 m silica guide through a taper of height 3@xmath0 m . as mentioned earlier , such structures were analyzed in detail for the loss in the tapered region @xcite .",
    "it was shown that about 70% of the incident flux can be coupled into the nano - guide .",
    "we study a similar system except that the core is now replaced by the electro - optic polymer .",
    "to be specific , we use the fdtd technique to study the coupling of electromagnetic energy from the micro - guide to the 50 nm gpw .",
    "the simulation again confirms that only the tm polarized modes of the micro - guide can be coupled to the sub - wavelength gpw ( figure [ fig : fdtd ] ) . the phase accumulated by the plasmon mode propagating along the polymer channel",
    "is expected to be proportional to the applied modulating voltage for small variations of @xmath6 from @xmath12 vide equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "further , since the electric field in the channel is inversely proportional to the distance between the electrodes , small variations in the applied voltage ( amounting to small power consumptions by the circuit ) should be sufficient to produce the requisite variations of @xmath6 in the sub - wavelength gpw .",
    "we extracted the phase of the magnetic field in the plasmon mode as a function of the propagation distance for two voltages corresponding to @xmath46 in the simulation ( see figure [ fig : phase ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the accumulated phase of the plasmon mode gives a phase difference of about @xmath47 for the two values of @xmath30 at a propagation length of 1.54@xmath0 m .",
    "thus it is shown that , in principle , the gpw configuration can be used effectively as a phase modulator over short distances by controlling the applied field .",
    "the feasibility of a subwavelength gpw as an efficient electro - optic intensity and phase modulator has been demonstrated by exploiting the single mode regime of the guide , albeit with the assumptions of an isotropic polymer and zero insertion loss .",
    "this proposal in principle , demonstrates the possibility of achieving electro - optic modulation at sub - wavelength scales and may find applications in nano - scale integrated optical circuits .",
