    "the existence of a forest of absorption lines blueward of the ly@xmath0 emission line in quasar spectra has been known for over 30 years ( bahcall and salpeter 1965 ; lynds 1971 ) .",
    "these lines arise from ly@xmath0 absorption by neutral hydrogen from intervening structure along the line - of - sight . early theoretical models interpreted this structure as absorption caused by discrete gas clouds in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , either pressure confined by a hot igm ( sargent  1980 ;",
    "ostriker and ikeuchi 1983 ) or confined by the gravity of dark matter ` mini - halos ' ( _ e.g. _ rees 1986 ) . over the last few years our understanding of the ly@xmath0 forest has undergone a transformation for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , observations with the keck telescope have produced almost noise - free spectra of quasars at high spectral resolution over the redshift range @xmath1 .",
    "the exquisite quality of keck spectra has allowed observers to resolve ly@xmath0 absorption lines at low column densities ( @xmath2 ) and to study their evolution . secondly , hydrodynamic numerical simulations of structure formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) universes with high spatial resolution are now possible and have proved remarkably successful in reproducing many observed properties of the ly@xmath0 forest ( cen  1994 ; zhang , anninos and norman 1995 , 1997 ; miralda - escud  1996 ; hernquist  1996 , theuns  1998a ) .",
    "these simulations have shown that most of the ly@xmath0 lines at column densities @xmath3 arise from modest fluctuations in the baryon density in a space filling photoionized igm , rather than from distinct clouds .",
    "the properties of the ly@xmath0 lines can therefore be used to probe the structure and thermal history of the diffuse igm and of the background uv radiation that determines its ionization state .",
    "the key characteristics of the numerical simulations are described in the next section .",
    "section 3 summarizes a number of results from these simulations and describes how the ly@xmath0 lines can be used to study the igm . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the properties of the low column density ly@xmath0 lines . for a discussion of damped ly@xmath0 systems and metal lines",
    "see pettini s contribution to these proceedings . for a recent review of observations and theoretical models of ly@xmath0 absorption lines",
    "see rauch ( 1998 ) .",
    "the simplest cosmological hydrodynamical simulations follow the evolution of ( optically thin ) gas and dark matter assuming a uniform photoionizing background .",
    "the simulation is therefore specified by :    @xmath4 parameters defining the cosmological model and its matter content ( _ e.g. _ @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) ;    @xmath4 the amplitude and spectral shape of the mass fluctuations ;    @xmath4 a model for the background uv flux as a function of redshift .    here",
    "we will review the evolution of cdm universes with initially scale - invariant adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "the linear power spectrum for these models ( in the limit of small baryon content ) is given by bardeen  ( 1986 ) .",
    "we adopt a reference model ( model s ) with parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the physical density in baryons in this model is @xmath13 .",
    "the model is normalized so that the rms density fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "the photoionizing background radiation is assumed to originate from quasars according to the model of haardt and madau ( 1996 , herafter hm ) .",
    "the photoionization rates for hydrogen and helium in this model are plotted in the left hand panel of figure 1 as a function of redshift . with these photoionization rates , and assuming a uniform igm , hydrogen is reionized at a redshift of @xmath16 and heii is reionized at @xmath17 .",
    "the right hand panel of figure 1 shows the distribution of gas elements in the temperature - density plane in a numerical simulation of our reference model s at a redshift of @xmath18 .",
    "there is a plume of shock heated gas extending to temperatures @xmath19k , but most of the gas has a low overdensity and follows a power law - like ` equation of state ' @xmath20 ( hui and gnedin 1997 ) . at times long after reionization , the diffuse igm will settle into a state in which adiabatic cooling is balanced by photoheating",
    ". the temperature of the igm will therefore tend towards @xmath21^{1/1.76 } , \\label{2 }   \\\\",
    "e(z ) = \\frac{h_0}{h(z ) } =   [ \\omega_m ( 1 + z)^3 + \\omega_k ( 1 + z)^2 + \\omega_\\lambda]^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed a power - law photoionizing background @xmath22 in equation ( 2.2 ) @xmath23 and the exponent @xmath24 arise from the temperature dependence of the hii and heiii recombination coefficients .",
    "figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of the gas in the simulation at @xmath18 .",
    "the upper figure shows the gas with temperature @xmath25k .",
    "this hot gas fills a small fraction of the volume and is located in the dense knots and filaments corresponding to collapsed structures .",
    "in contrast , the cool gas with @xmath26k ( shown in the lower figure ) fills most of the computational volume .",
    "it is this diffuse low density gas which we believe accounts for the vast majority of the observed ly@xmath0 lines .",
    "furthermore , because most of this gas is at low overdensities , @xmath27 , it is relatively easy to model numerically . by investigating the ly@xmath0 forest we can therfore hope to learn about the properties of the diffuse igm , which at typical quasar redshifts of @xmath28 contains most of the baryonic matter in the universe . in particular :",
    "@xmath4 the optical depth of hi and heii absorption can set constraints on the baryonic density of the universe and on the evolution , amplitude and spectrum of the photoionizing background ;    @xmath4 the fluctuating optical depth of hi absorption can be used to construct the power spectrum of the matter fluctuations at redshifts @xmath29 ;    @xmath4 the ly@xmath0 absorption line - widths can be used to infer the temperature and equation of state of the diffuse igm and its evolution .",
    "these topics will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the optical depth for hi ly@xmath0 absorption from an igm in ionization equilibrium with density @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 ( _ e.g. _ peebles 1993  23 ) , where @xmath32 is the photoionization rate for hi and @xmath33 is the temperature of the igm in units of @xmath34k .",
    "variations in @xmath35 along the line - of - sight will produce a ` fluctuating gunn - peterson ' effect . an observed absorption line spectrum can therefore be inverted to infer the clustering of the baryon distribution as pioneered by croft ( 1998 , see section 3c below ) .",
    "the mean hi and heii optical depths as a function of redshift are plotted in figure 3 for our fiducial model s. the open squares show the optical depths derived using half the amplitude of the hm uv background . with this choice of photoionizing background , the mean hi optical depth of the simulation matches observations quite well over the redshift range @xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "evidently , the amplitude of the photoionizing background can be balanced by variations in other cosmological parameters according to equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) to preserve the match to observations .",
    "the simulations thefore imply that @xmath38 this type of criterion has been used by weinberg  ( 1997 ) to set a crude lower limit to the baryon density . at redshifts",
    "@xmath36@xmath39 one can be reasonably confident of the hm model of the photoionizing background at around the lyman edge , because the quasar luminosity function is quite well determined at these redshifts ( see section 3 of madau s article in these proceedings ) .",
    "the hm model provides a lower limit to the photoionizing flux because it ignores additional photoionizing radiation from star formation .",
    "the temperature of a photoionized igm can not exceed a few times @xmath34k , but its precise value depends on the past thermal and ionization history of the igm .",
    "uncertainties in the temperature of the igm lead to an additional source of uncertainty in using equation ( [ omb ] ) to derive a bound on the baryon density",
    ". nevertheless , equation ( [ omb ] ) implies @xmath40 , interestingly close to the baryon density of @xmath41 inferred from primorial nucleosynthesis and the deuterium abundances measured in quasar spectra ( burles and tytler 1998 , burles , kirkman and tytler 1999 ) .",
    "the observed hi optical depth therefore leads to a consistent picture in which most of the baryons in the universe at @xmath42@xmath37 belong to the diffuse photoionized igm .",
    "the heii optical depth is shown in the lower panel of figure 3 .",
    "the open squares show @xmath43 computed from the simulation using the same amplitude for the photoionizing background that provides a good match to @xmath44 .",
    "the results from the simulation lie below the observations at all redshifts , suggesting that the photoinizing background has a softer spectrum than computed by hm . in photoionization equilibrium ,",
    "the optical depth in heii is related to the optical depth in hi by @xmath45 , and so @xmath43 can be raised by softening the photoionizing spectrum appropriately . by lowering @xmath46 by a factor of two compared to the hm model of figure 1 , model s can match the observations at @xmath47 , but can not match the high heii optical depths at @xmath48 found in the recent hst - stis observations of the quasar q0302 - 003 by heap  ( 2000 ) .",
    "one possible interpretation of these results is that the typical quasar spectrum adopted by hm is too hard and that heii reionization is delayed until a redshift @xmath49 , corresponding to the abrupt change in heii opacity observed by heap  ( 2000 ) .",
    "additional arguments to support this picture are discussed in section ( 3d ) .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then agn and ` mini - quasars ' can not produce much photoionizing radiation capable of doubly - ionizing helium at redshifts @xmath50 ( see the article by rees in this volume ) .      it has been known for many years that ly@xmath0 forest shows strong cosmological evolution ( _ e.g. _ sargent  1980 ) . over a narrow range in redshift the evolution can be approximated by a power law @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of lines above a threshold rest frame equivalent width ( typically @xmath53 ) . from high resolution keck observations ,",
    "kim  ( 1997 ) find @xmath54 in the redshift range @xmath55 .",
    "williger  ( 1994 ) find that the evolution is still stronger at higher redshifts with @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , observations with the hst indicate much weaker evolution at low redshifts with @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( morris  1991 ; bahcall  1991 , 1993 ; impey  1996 ) .",
    "the evolution of the ly@xmath0 forest , including the low rates of evolution at redshifts @xmath60 can be reproduced quite simply in cdm models ( theuns , leonard and efstathiou 1998b ; dav  1999 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 which shows the evolution of the number of ly@xmath0 lines within a given range of column density for our reference model s. ( the lines are identified by fitting voigt profiles to simulated keck spectra using the line - fitting program vpfit , webb 1987 ) .",
    "as in section ( 3a ) we adopt the hm model of the photoionizing background with an amplitude divided by a factor of @xmath36 to match the observed optical depth in hi absorption .",
    "this model reproduces the observed column density distribution accurately over the column density range @xmath61 ( see figure 2 of theuns  1998b ) and , as figure 4 shows , also reproduces the observed rates of evolution as a function of column density . in particular ,",
    "the decrease in the rate of evolution of the ly@xmath0 lines found from hst observations arises from the steep decline in the photoionizing background at @xmath60 caused by the rapid drop in quasar numbers at low redshift .",
    "equations ( 2.1 ) and ( 3.1 ) can be combined to write the observed transmitted flux in terms of fluctuations in the baryon density , @xmath62 , \\qquad   \\beta \\approx ( 2.76 - 0.76 \\gamma).\\ ] ] croft  ( 1998 ) have used this relation to infer the 1-dimensional power spectrum @xmath63 of the baryon fluctuations , from which the three - dimensional power spectrum can be recovered by differentiation , @xmath64 croft  ( 1998 ) calibrate the amplitude of the matter power spectrum by comparing against numerical simulations .",
    "the procedure is not completely straightforward and we refer the reader to croft  ( 1998 ) for details . by testing their inversion algorithm against numerical simulations",
    "these authors find that the amplitude and shape of the underlying matter power spectrum can be recovered accurately and that the recovery is insensitive to uncertainties in the equation of state .",
    "a variant of this technique , that incorporates a correction for the distortion of the clustering pattern by peculiar velocities , is described by nusser and haehnelt ( 1999 ) .",
    "croft  ( 1999 ) describe an application of their method to a sample of @xmath65 quasar spectra spanning the redshift range @xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "they recover @xmath68 at @xmath69 over the ( comoving ) wavenumber range @xmath70@xmath71 and find that it is well fitted by a power law @xmath72 with @xmath73 , consistent with what is expected from cdm models .",
    "this important result is the first attempted determination of the matter power spectrum at high redshift .",
    "the amplitude of the inferred power spectrum is high compared to that expected for spatially flat cdm models with @xmath74 normalized to reproduce the abundance of rich clusters at the present day .",
    "the best fitting cdm models have @xmath75 ( weinberg  1999 ; phillips  2000 ) , in agreement with the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 derived from combining observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation and distant type ia supernovae ( _ e.g. _ efstathiou  1999 and references therein ) .",
    "constraints on neutrino masses from estimates of @xmath68 at high redshift are discussed by croft , hu and dav ( 1999 ) .",
    "the widths of the ly@xmath0 lines are usually characterised by the broadening parameter @xmath78 determined by fitting voigt profiles .",
    "if the line width is caused by thermal broadening , the parameter @xmath78 is related to the temperature of the gas by @xmath79 in reality , a number of mechanisms in addition to thermal broadening contribute to the widths of the lines , _",
    "e.g. _ the differential hubble flow across the absorbing region and the smoothing of small scale fluctuations by gas pressure ( bryan  1999 ; theuns , schaye and haenhelt 2000 ) .",
    "the first sets of simulations of the ly@xmath0 forest in cdm models appeared to show good agreement with the observed @xmath78-parameter distributions .",
    "however , subsequent simulations with higher spatial resolution produced a larger fraction of narrower lines than observed ( theuns  1998a ; bryan  1999 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 which shows observations of the @xmath78 distribution at @xmath80 compared to the results from numerical simulations .",
    "the figure to the left shows the distribution derived by fitting voigt profiles to simulated spectra from reference model s ( solid line ) .",
    "the lines in this model are clearly too narrow , suggesting that the temperature of the igm is too low .",
    "from the assymptotic relation ( 2.2 ) one can see that the temperature of the igm can be raised by increasing the baryon density and by lowering @xmath5 ( the assymptotic temperature is extremely insentive to the amplitude of the photoionizing background long after reionization ) .",
    "the right hand panel shows the effect of increasing the baryon density to @xmath81 .",
    "the dashed lines in each panel show the effect of lowering @xmath5 and introducing a cosmological constant so that the universe remains spatially flat .",
    "these variations in cosmological parameters can go some way to resolving the conflict with observations ( theuns  1999 ) , but can not provide an exact match unless the baryon density is much higher than the value favoured from primordial nucleosythesis .",
    "this suggests that we are missing a significant heating source of the igm .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been suggested that might boost the temperature of the igm , _",
    "e.g. _ photoelectric heating of dust grains ( nath , sethi and shchekinov 1999 ) and compton heating by the hard x - ray background ( madau and efstathiou 1999 ) . however , the most plausible explanation ( abel and haenhelt 1999 ) is that the simulations underestimate the temperature at @xmath82 because they assume an optically thin igm ( and also a uniform photoionizing background that has _",
    "already _ been reprocessed by lyman @xmath0 absorbing clouds , haardt and madau 1996 ) .",
    "this is inconsistent and the simulations should properly include the effects of radiative transfer while the medium is still optically thick prior to complete reionization , because in this regime every photoionizing photon is absorbed and contributes to heating the igm .",
    "abel and haehnelt estimate that correct inclusion of radiative transfer during the epoch of heii reionization might increase the temperature of the igm by a factor of @xmath83 , perhaps enough to resolve the discrepancy with the observed @xmath78-parameter distributions illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "the idea that the temperature of the igm at @xmath82 is boosted by heii reionization is supported by the analysis of the equation of state of the igm described in the next subsection .",
    "as we have mentioned , a number of physical mechanisms contribute to the breadth of the @xmath78-distribution .",
    "however , the minimum line - width is set by the temperature of the gas , which in turn depends on the density ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure 1 ) . by fitting the cut - off in the @xmath78-distribution as a function of column density ( the ` @xmath84 ' distribution ) one",
    "can therefore reconstruct the effective equation of state of the igm ( schaye ,  1999 ; ricotti , gnedin and shull 2000 ; bryan and machacek 2000 ) .",
    "the method is illustrated by figure 6 which shows the @xmath84 distributions derived by applying the vpfit line - fitting program to two cosmological simulations .",
    "results for the standard reference model s are plotted in figure ( 6b ) .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows a hotter model , which has the same parameters as model lb plotted in figure 5 but with the hei and heii photoheating rates doubled over those of the hm model ( crudely representing ` radiative transfer ' effects during the reionization of helium ) .",
    "the dashed line in the figure shows the best fit to the lower envelope of the @xmath84 distribution of figure ( 6a ) determined by applying the iterative fitting algorithm of schaye  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the same line is plotted in figure ( 6b ) and passes almost through the middle of the @xmath84 distribution of the colder model .",
    "the lower envelope of the @xmath84 distribution is clearly a sensitive indicator of the characteristic temperature of the ly@xmath0 clouds and can be accurately determined from fits to high resolution quasar spectra .    what is more difficult is to convert the fit to the lower envelope of the @xmath84 distribution , @xmath85 , into the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the effective equation of state of the igm ( equation 2.1 )",
    "this is done by calibrating @xmath88 and @xmath89 against @xmath86 and @xmath87 using numerical simulations with different equations of state ( see schaye  1999 for details ) .",
    "the results of applying this technique to nine high - quality quasar spectra spanning the redshift range @xmath90 are shown in figure 7 ( schaye  2000 ) .",
    "except for the two lowest redshift quasars , the ly@xmath0 forest spectra were divided in two to reduce the effects of redshift evolution and signal - to - noise variations across a single spectrum . from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , the inferred temperature at the mean density of the igm , @xmath86 , increases and the gas is close to isothermal ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this behaviour differs markedly from that expected if helium were fully reionized at higher redshift .",
    "for example , the solid lines show the evolution of the equation of state in a simulation with the hm background . in this simulation ,",
    "both hydrogen and helium are fully ionized by @xmath94 and the temperature of the igm declines slowly as the universe expands tending to the assymptotic form of equation ( 2.2 ) .",
    "this model can not account for the peak in the temperature at @xmath92 inferred from the observations .",
    "instead , we associate the peak in @xmath86 , and the low value of @xmath87 , with reheating caused by the second reionization of helium ( heii @xmath95 heiii ) . this interpretation is supported by the abrupt change in heii opacity at @xmath92 from the measurements of heap  ( 2000 ) discussed in section 3(a ) .",
    "it is also consistent with evidence from the ratio siiv / civ that the spectrum of the photoionizing background hardens abruptly at @xmath96 ( songaila and cowie 1996 ; songaila 1998 ) .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 7 show a ` designer model ' with parameters tuned to fit the observations .",
    "this simulation has a much softer uv background at high redshift than the model shown by the solid line , and consequently heii reionizes at @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , the photoheating rates have been enhanced during reionization to boost the temperature of the igm ( again , crudely modelling the heating of optically thick gas ) .",
    "this model is suggestive that the jump in temperature at @xmath92 may be associated with heii reionization , but clearly more realistic simulations that include radiative transfer are required to determine the evolution of the equation of state during the reionization phase more accurately .",
    "further observations would also be useful to assess how steeply the igm temperature changes between @xmath98 and @xmath18 .",
    "the work reviewed in this article provides a powerful case that the ly@xmath0 forest arises from a space - filling , highly photoionized diffuse igm that contains most of the baryonic material in the universe at high redshift .",
    "this model is a natural outcome of cdm theories of structure formation and can account for many observed properties of the ly@xmath0 forest in quantitative detail .",
    "the general features of the model thus seem to us to be reasonably secure .    however , a more detailed analysis of the thermal history of the igm requires simulations that incorporate radiative transfer and a model for the spatial distribution of ionizing sources .",
    "such calculations are now being done ( abel , norman and madau 1999 ; gnedin 2000 ; madau these proceedings ) but the computational problems are formidable .",
    "some outstanding problems that deserve further attention include :        @xmath4 analysis of inhomogeneities in the temperature of the igm .",
    "are there , for example , regions in the spectra of quasars in which ly@xmath0 line - widths are systematically broader or narrower than in other regions ?          j. schaye thanks the isaac newton trust for financial support and pparc for the award of a studentship .",
    "we also thank anthony leonard , michael rauch and wal sargent for their contributions to this work ."
