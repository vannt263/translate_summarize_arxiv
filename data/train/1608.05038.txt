    "in timmons versus twin - cities - area new party , the u.s . supreme court considered the constitutionality of the `` many barriers in the political arena@xcite . ''",
    "the twin - cities - area new party argued that its associational rights were violated by minnesota electoral law .",
    "writing for the majority , renquist thinks `` the constitution permits the minnesota legislature to decide that political stability is best served through a healthy two - party system@xcite , is a function , @xmath0 , of the quantity of parties , @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath2 ) .",
    "this manuscript clarifies that the stability is a function , @xmath3 , only of the quantity of electors , @xmath4 ( i.e. @xmath5 ) ; and that that the rigidity , @xmath6 , is a function , @xmath7 , of the quantity of parties , @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath8 ) . ] . ''",
    "though what the u.s .",
    "constitution permits or does not permit with regard to associational rights is outside the present scope , the author draws on techniques well known in statistical mechanics to refute the thought that premises timmons .",
    "the author concludes that electoral stability and rigidity are best served by increasing the quantity of electors and decreasing the quantity of parties , respectively .",
    "electoral science has a long tradition of combining ethics and reason to study how choice is resolved .",
    "with respect to ethics , black@xcite recounts two conundra such that in a close election into @xmath1 parts ( see section  [ sec : vote - configurations ] ) .",
    "thus , the formalism here applies to most any vote by any electoral body regardless of who the electors are ( i.e. , citizens , committees , juries , executives , judges , legislators , etc . ) or the subject matter(s ) under consideration .",
    "four relevant applications of this theory are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] . ] between people , motions , or parties , the election may be with an unjust resolution or without any resolution .",
    "specifically , borda@xcite describes that the party with the highest number of votes may not be the most preferred party and condorcet@xcite describes a three - way draw .",
    "though several authors@xcite prescribe rules to reduce these likelihoods , arrow@xcite proves that it is impossible to preclude them .",
    "ethics aside , key@xcite and campbell@xcite explain a theory of critical elections whereby the electorate s direction is flipped or rotated as compared to antecedent elections , and moreover the re - orientation persists for one or more subsequent elections .",
    "these latter two studies are of particular relevance to the present study because they employ directionality in a qualitative manner to describe the electorate , whereas herein the author uses vectors , which include both magnitude and direction , to study the electorate in a quantitative manner .",
    "the problem addressed here is to understand how the stability and rigidity of an electoral system vary with the quantity of electors , @xmath4 , and parties , @xmath1 .",
    "the philosophical approach ( section  [ sec : phil - approach ] ) is to adhere to the law of parsimony by utilizing an isotropic preference structure .",
    "the technical approach ( section  [ sec : approach ] ) is to understand multi - party electoral systems by utilizing multinomial properties and both magnitudal and directional ensemble averages .",
    "the results ( section  [ sec : results ] ) are explained qualitatively by using two visual aids ( figures  [ fig : results - stability ] and [ fig : results - rigidity ] ) , and quantitatively by writing closed - form analytic expressions for the stability ( equation  [ eq : stability - closed - form ] ) and rigidity ( equation  [ eq : rigidity - closed - form ] ) of electoral systems .",
    "results indicate that ( i ) beginning with absolute instability for a single - elector system , the stability increases monotonically to unity as the quantity of electors , @xmath4 , increases ; and ( ii ) beginning with absolute rigidity for a one - party system , the rigidity decreases monotonically to null as the quantity of parties , @xmath1 , increases .",
    "the discussion ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) focuses on asking and answering the following question : how does this theory of electoral dynamics enhance the understanding of a real electoral systems .",
    "this discussion makes use of the constitutional order of the united states of america as an archetype .",
    "each branch of government is analyzed individually and then they are analyzed together comparatively .",
    "finally , the author draws three conclusions ( section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) : ( 1 ) electoral stability is best served by increasing the quantity of electors ; ( 2 ) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing the quantity of parties , and decreasing their proportional representation ; and ( 3 ) the less stable a branch of government , the more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people .",
    "there are two appendices .",
    "each provides a necessary mathematical proof .",
    "the author s approach is grounded in the canon of philosophical thought . throughout this study of electoral dynamics",
    "the author adheres to ockham s law of parsimony : `` explain[ing ] by the assumption of fewer things  @xcite , '' while adequately representing the most salient properties . as a consequence",
    ", the author utilizes an isotropic preference structure  the underlying preference is uniformly likely to be in any direction  and measures the properties of the entire ensemble of permissible preference structures .",
    "a description of any one structure is foregone in favor of a gross description of all structures simultaneously .",
    "this approach is idealistic and realistic .",
    "conventional wisdom dictates that `` politics makes strange bedfellows@xcite . ''",
    "thus , no matter how seemingly unlikely an electoral alliance may appear , even the least preferable alliance may not be ignored or discounted .",
    "further , we empirically know that there are numerous ways for party  a and party  b to be oriented . at any given time , party  a and party  b may be in agreement ( parallel orientation ) and be either in favor of or against electoral issue @xmath9 ; they may be in disagreement and be in opposition ( anti - parallel orientation ) on electoral issue @xmath10 ; either party may be in favor of or against electoral issue @xmath11 while the other party is ambivalent@xcite on the issue ( perpendicular orientation ) ; or , they may both be ambivalent to electoral issue @xmath12 , but for different reasons ( co - planar orientation ) .",
    "the technical approach is to expand from an understanding of a binary system@xcite , whose states are described with a binomial expansion , to an understanding of a multi - party system , whose states are described by a multinomial expansion .",
    "the author begins by specifying the model that is used to represent electoral systems ( section  [ sec : specification - model ] ) .",
    "the author continues by writing the generating function , which yields the probability of each and every vote by an electorate ( section  [ sec : generating - function ] ) .",
    "then , the author defines the primary vectors that will be used throughout this study ; chief among them are the electoral vector and the equilibrium - electoral vector ( section  [ sec : vector - definitions ] ) .",
    "the author then briefly uses number theory to explain that each and every vote taken by an electorate is a permutation of the partitions of a positive integer @xmath4 into @xmath1 ( section  [ sec : vote - configurations ] ) .",
    "the author explains the relationship between the multiplicity of each vote configuration and the probability - density function of a multinomially distributed variable ( section  [ sec : multiplicity - function ] ) .",
    "next , the author explains that a quantitative understanding of an electoral dynamics necessitates the use of two ensemble averages : a magnitudal and a directional average ( section  [ sec : ensemble - averages ] ) .",
    "the author then uses vector algebra to define the fractional fluctuation , which a relative measure of the expected deviation of a system from its equilibrium ( section  [ sec : fractional - fluctuation ] ) .",
    "the author explains that the fractional fluctuation is separable , and may be written as the product of the volatility , which is solely a function of the quantity of electors , and the flexibility , which is solely a function of the quantity of parties ; and that the stability and rigidity are the unitary complements of the volatility and flexibility , respectively ( section  [ sec - four - dynamic - variables ] ) .",
    "two assist the reader in comprehending this material , the author provides an example electoral system in figure  [ fig : model_system ] , several examples of integer partitions of @xmath4 into @xmath1 in table  [ tab : one ] , and a thorough example of how to calculate an ensemble average in table  [ tab : two- ] .",
    "the author enumerates this theory with eleven statements , all of which are given below    1 .",
    "there is a positive integer number , @xmath4 , of seat of power in the system .",
    "2 .   an elector occupies each and every seats of power .",
    "3 .   there is a fixed integer @xmath1 of possible outcomes .",
    "the direction of the @xmath13 possible outcome points in the direction of unit vector @xmath14 .",
    "5 .   each elector must align with one and only one outcome .",
    "the event probabilities of the outcomes are @xmath15 , 7 .",
    "an elector aligned with the @xmath13 outcome will have an electoral moment @xmath16 .",
    "each permutation of the electoral marks is electorally allowed .",
    "each orientation of the electoral moments is electorally allowed .",
    "the directional probabilities of orientation are uniformly distributed over all orientations .",
    "the direction of the electoral moment @xmath16 is isotropic for @xmath17 .",
    "an example of the model electoral system is illustrated in figure  [ fig : model_system ] . there",
    "the reader finds five seats of power , each occupied with an elector whose single arrow points is aligned with one of four distinct parties .",
    "the state of the example system is such that there is one elector aligned with party 1 , one elector aligned with party 2 , two electors aligned with party three , and one elector aligned with party 4 .",
    "example electoral system . here",
    "the electoral system is comprised of five ( @xmath18 ) electors whose moments , @xmath19 , points in one of four ( @xmath20 ) directions .",
    "the state illustrated here has two electors pointing in the direction of the party 3 , whereas there is one elector pointing in the direction of the remaining parties ; thus , the electoral vector of this state is @xmath21 . though it may appear in this figure that @xmath22 , in reality these vectors exist in a multidimensional vector space .",
    "the interested reader may find more information in appendix  [ sec : proof - a].,width=377 ]      each and every permutation of a vote by an electorate is generated by the symbolic product of @xmath4 factors as @xmath23 each factor represents an elector that is directed in exactly one of some fixed finite number @xmath1 possible directions , @xmath24 , with probabilities @xmath25 .",
    "consistent with electoral reality , these probabilities are bounded as @xmath26 and constrained as @xmath27 on multiplication , there are @xmath28 terms , one each for the @xmath28 permutations of the marks .",
    "the set of directional unit vectors @xmath24 need not form an orthogonal set ( see appendix  [ sec : proof - a ] ) .",
    "each state of the system has a correspondence with an electoral - excess vector , @xmath29 , that describes it as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of electors aligned with the @xmath32 party .",
    "additionally , each system has an equilibrium - electoral vector that is given as @xmath33 from these two , the author defines the electoral - excess vector as @xmath34 the last vector to be defined is the one vector , @xmath35 .",
    "it is given as a linear combination of the directions of all the outcomes as @xmath36 the reader recalls that @xmath14 is the orientation of the @xmath32 party , and @xmath37 is the event probability of outcome @xmath11 .",
    "irrespective of each elector s underlying preference , the result of a vote is always a partition  @xcite of @xmath4 into exactly @xmath1 parts seats of power that @xmath38 electors abstain . including for this eventuality , the system has one additional outcome .",
    "thus by taking into account absentions , a vote is always a partition of @xmath4 into exactly @xmath39 parts . ] . in table",
    "[ tab : one ] , the author presents five complete set of partitions ; one each for five distinct electoral systems . in all cases , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the cardinality , @xmath42 , of each set , @xmath43 , is written on the last row of the table .",
    ".[tab : one ] example of partitions of @xmath4 into @xmath1 .",
    "irrespective of each elector s preferential marks , the vote must tally to a partition of @xmath4 into @xmath1 .",
    "the cardinality , @xmath42 , of each set of partitions , @xmath43 , is given on the bottom - most row . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      an individual analysis of the executive branch , the judicial branch , and the legislative branch is given in sections  [ sec : executive - ranch ] , [ sec : judicial - ranch ] , and [ sec : legislative - branch ] , respectively .",
    "the stability and rigidity of each branch is sequentially described .",
    "each attribute is bounded from below and bounded from above .",
    "the executive branch of government is comprised of the federal offices of the president and the vice president . if the executive branch only included the president , then the executive branch would be a single - elector system and thus absolutely unstable ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) . because the founding fathers incorporated a line of succession that includes the federal office of the vice president , the executive branch is stabilized  at least to some extent . in consideration of these facts ,",
    "the author states that the stability of the executive branch , @xmath45 , is bounded as @xmath46 .",
    "when deliberating any choice , the president may seek extensive council and demand multiple options from advisors and administrators .",
    "ultimately the buck passing stops with the president who is solely responsible to reduce the quantity of choices and select an outcome .",
    "each choice made by the president is circumstantial . at any time",
    ", there may be a myriad of choices under deliberation .",
    "in consideration of these facts , the author states that the rigidity of the executive branch , @xmath47 , is bounded as @xmath48 .",
    "the judicial branch of government is comprised of the federal offices of the justices of the supreme court .",
    "every decision is made by a majority vote ; however , justices may recuse themselves from participation in any official action .",
    "that said , six members of the court constitute a quorum . in consideration of these facts ,",
    "the author states that the stability of the judicial branch , @xmath49 , is bounded as @xmath50 . in theory ,",
    "lady justice is blind and so non - partisan .",
    "the justices , in their robes may be considered either indistinguishable from each other or disitinguishable ( i.e. , independent judicial review ) .",
    "subsequently , there are often unanimous decision and there are also often more than one dissenting opinion . in consideration of these facts ,",
    "the author states that the rigidity of the judical branch , @xmath51 , is bounded as @xmath52 .",
    "the legislative branch of government is bicameral ; it is composed of the senate and the house of representatives .",
    "the quantity of electors in these branches are 101 and 430 , respectively .",
    "article  i , section  5 of the constitution requires that a quorum to conduct official senate business is the smallest integer larger than half the quantity of electors ( i.e. 51 ) . whereas given by the clerk of the house of representatives , `` when there are no vacancies in the membership , a quorum is 218 .. '' in consideration of these facts , the author states that the stability of the senate , @xmath53 , and the house of representatives , @xmath54 , are bounded as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .    with respect to rigidity , while party cohesion is certainly factored into their choices , each member of congress is also tied to the parochial interests of their local constituency , as well as the political patronage from within and without their respective constituency .",
    "therefore , as in the judical branch , the author states that the rigidity of each camera is bounded from below by their respecive quantity of members ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) ; and is bounded from above by the possibility of the electors acting in unison with consensus ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) . in consideration of the above , author states that the rigidity of the senate , @xmath59 , and the house of representatives , @xmath60 , are bounded as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the summary of individual analyses of each branch of government is given in table  [ tab : multiply - branched - systems ] .",
    "the data is consistent with the experience of the everyday lay political observer and the astute specialist .",
    "the author finds that resulting from the inherent instability of the executive branch it is no wonder that the election of the president / vice president is the most watched and the most contested of all .",
    "further , one recognizes what the founders tacitly understood ; specifically that a succession plan acts to stabilize the executive branch in case of a national tragedy or an untimely death .",
    "the second most fevered pitch in the political calendar of the united states occurs when the nation undergoes a supreme - court confirmation .",
    "it is precisely because of the relatively low stability of a nine - seat jury opining on issues fundamently relevent to 300 million people that the justices be thoroughly vetted and even subject to a super - majority vote .",
    "to first - order approximation , among the bicameral legislative branches , the observer notes that the senate , with its lesser quantity of electors and concomitant greater instability , is the more valued legislative prize for the parties that comprise the political order ; and that the house of representative , with its greater quantity of electors and greater stability , provides the highest fidelity representation of the people .",
    "given that the number of electors is at most 8 billion ( ) we may not safely presume that the most probably configuration is the only configuration is the only significant configuration for electoral systems .",
    "this manuscript is inspired by the supreme court s majority opinion on timmons versus the twin - cities area new party .",
    "the author draws on techniques well known in statistical mechanics to refute the majority opinion of the court . in conclusion ,",
    "( _ i _ ) electoral stability and electoral rigidity are best served by increasing the quantity of electors , ( _ ii _ ) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing the quantity of parties and reducing their proportional representation , and ( _ iii _ ) the less stable a branch of government , the more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people .",

    "<S> ( _ i _ ) electoral stability is best served by increasing the quantity of electors ; ( _ ii _ ) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing the quantity of parties , and by increasing the representation of some parties at the expense of others ; and ( _ iii _ ) the less stable a branch of government , the more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people . </S>",
