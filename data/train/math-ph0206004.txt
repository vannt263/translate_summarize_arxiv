    "one of the most interesting features of many nonlinear evolution equations is the spontaneous onset of singularities in solutions starting from perfectly smooth initial data .",
    "such a phenomenon , usually called `` blowup '' , has been a subject of intensive studies in many fields ranging from fluid dynamics to general relativity .",
    "whether or not the blowup can occur for a given nonlinear evolution equation is the central mathematical question which , from the physical point of view , has a direct bearing on our understanding of the limits of validity of the corresponding model .",
    "unfortunately , this is often a difficult question .",
    "two famous examples for which the answer is not known are the navier - stokes equation and the einstein equations . once the existence of blowup is established for a particular equation , many further questions come up , such as : when and where does the blowup occur ? what is the character of blowup and is it universal ? can a solution be continued past the singularity ?",
    "in this paper we consider these questions for the yang - mills ( ym ) equations in higher dimensions . in the physical @xmath0 dimensions , where the ym equations are the basic equations of gauge theories describing the weak and strong interactions of elementary particles",
    ", it is known that no singularities can form .",
    "this was shown by eardley and moncrief  @xcite who proved that solutions starting from smooth initial data remain smooth for all future times .",
    "the motivation for studying the ym equations in unphysical @xmath1 dimensions for @xmath2 is twofold ( and unrelated to the latest fashion of doing physics in extra dimensions ) . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", it is the obvious thing to ask how the property of global regularity depends on the dimension of the underlying spacetime and whether singularities can form in @xmath1 dimensions for @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is also a less evident physical reason which is motivated by the hope that by understanding the problem of singularity formation for the ym equations one might get insight into the analogous , but much more difficult , problem in general relativity . from this viewpoint  in which the ym equations are considered as a toy model for the einstein equations ",
    "it is essential that these two equations belong to the same criticality class .",
    "let us recall that the criticality class is defined as the degree @xmath3 in the homogeneous scaling of energy @xmath4 under dilations @xmath5 .",
    "the classification of equations into subcritical ( @xmath6 ) , critical ( @xmath7 ) , and supercritical ( @xmath8 ) is a basis of the heuristic meta - principle according to which subcritical equations are globally regular , while supercritical equations may develop singularities for some ( large ) initial data  @xcite . for the ym equations we have @xmath9 , while for the einstein equations @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the ym equations in @xmath11 have the same criticality , @xmath12 , as the einstein equations in the physical dimension .",
    "another way of seeing this is to note that in @xmath11 the dimension of the ym coupling constant @xmath13=m^{-1 } l^{d-4}$ ] ( in @xmath14 units ) is the same as the dimension of the physical newton s constant @xmath15=m^{-1 } l$ ] .",
    "for the reason just explained , the main body of this paper is focused on the lowest super - critical dimension @xmath11 . in section  3",
    "we show that in this case there exists a countable family of regular ( by regularity we mean analyticity inside the future light cone ) spherically symmetric self - similar solutions labelled by a nonnegative integer @xmath16 ( a nodal number ) .",
    "next , using linear stability analysis we show in section  4 that the number of unstable modes around a given solution is equal to its nodal number .",
    "the role of self - similar solutions in the dynamical evolution is studied in section  5 , where we show that : i ) the @xmath17 solution determines a universal asymptotics of singularity formation for solutions starting from generic `` large '' initial data ; ii ) the @xmath18 solution plays the role of a critical solution sitting at the threshold of singularity formation .",
    "the latter is in many respects similar to the critical behaviour at the threshold of black hole formation in gravitational collapse . in both cases the threshold of singularity ( or black hole )",
    "formation can be identified with the codimension - one stable manifold of a self - similar solution with exactly one unstable mode .",
    "these similarities are discussed in detail in section  6 .",
    "we consider also the cauchy problem for the ym equations in @xmath19 . despite intensive studies of this borderline case ,",
    "the problem of global existence is open . in section  7",
    "we describe numerical simulations which , in combination with analytic results , strongly suggest that large - energy solutions do blow up .",
    "we show that the process of singularity formation is due to concentration of energy and proceeds via adiabatic shrinking of the instanton solution . at the end , a recent attempt of determining the asymptotic rate of shrinking is sketched .",
    "we remark that there are close parallels between ym equations in @xmath1 dimensions and wave maps in @xmath20 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , many of the phenomena described here are mirrored for the equivariant wave maps into spheres in three  @xcite and two  @xcite spatial dimensions .",
    "sections  5 and 7 of this survey are based on joint work with z. tabor  @xcite .",
    "the material of sections  3 and 4 is new .",
    "we consider yang - mills ( ym ) fields in @xmath1 dimensional minkowski spacetime ( in the following latin and greek indices take the values @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively ) .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath23 is a one - form with values in the lie algebra @xmath24 of a compact lie group @xmath25 . in terms of the curvature",
    "@xmath26 $ ] the action is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath29 .",
    "the ym equations derived from ( [ action ] ) are @xmath30 = 0.\\ ] ] as written , this equation is underdetermined because of the gauge invariance @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary function with values in @xmath25 . in order to correctly formulate the cauchy problem for equation ( [ ymeq ] ) , one must impose additional conditions which fix this gauge ambiguity .",
    "we shall not discuss this issue here because in the spherically symmetric ansatz , to which this paper is restricted , the gauge is fixed automatically .    for simplicity , we take here @xmath33 so the elements of @xmath34 can be considered as skew - symmetric @xmath35 matrices and the lie bracket is the usual commutator . assuming the spherically symmetric ansatz  @xcite @xmath36 the ym equations reduce to the scalar semilinear wave equation for the magnetic potential @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radial laplacian in @xmath40 dimensions .",
    "the central question for equation ( [ wave ] ) is : can solutions starting from smooth initial data @xmath41 become singular in future ? as mentioned above , in the physical @xmath42 dimensions eardley and moncrief answered this question in the negative  @xcite .",
    "however , simple heuristic arguments indicate that the property of global regularity enjoyed by the ym equations in @xmath42 might break down in higher dimensions . in order to see why the global behaviour of solutions is expected to depend critically on the dimension @xmath43",
    ", we recall two basic facts .",
    "the first fact is the conservation of ( positive definite ) energy @xmath44 where the coefficient @xmath45 follows from the integration over the angles and taking the trace .",
    "the second fact is scale - invariance of the ym equations : if @xmath46 is a solution of ( [ ymeq ] ) , so is @xmath47 , or equivalently , if @xmath37 is a solution of ( [ wave ] ) , so is @xmath48 . under this scaling the energy scales as @xmath49 ,",
    "hence the ym equations are subcritical for @xmath50 , critical for @xmath19 , and supercritical for @xmath51 . in the subcritical case ,",
    "shrinking of solutions to arbitrarily small scales costs infinite amount of energy , so it is forbidden by energy conservation . in other words ,",
    "transfer of energy to arbitrarily high frequencies is impossible and consequently the cauchy problem should be well posed in the energy norm .",
    "this important fact was proved in @xmath42 by klainerman and machedon  @xcite , who thereby strengthened the result of eardley and moncrief . in the supercritical case , shrinking of solutions might be energetically favourable and consequently singularities are anticipated .",
    "in fact , we shall show below that singularities do form already in the lowest supercritical dimension @xmath11 . in the critical dimension",
    "@xmath19 the problem of singularity formation is more subtle because the scaling argument is inconclusive .",
    "in order to set the stage for the discussion of singularity formation we first need to analyze in detail the structure of self - similar solutions of equation ( [ wave ] ) . as we shall see , these solutions play a key role in understanding the nature of blowup . by definition ,",
    "self - similar solutions are invariant under dilations @xmath52 , hence they have the form @xmath53 where a positive constant @xmath54 , clearly allowed by the time translation invariance , is introduced for later convenience . note that for a self - similar solution we have @xmath55 hence the solution becomes singular at the center when @xmath56 ( there is no blowup in the first derivative because regularity demands that @xmath57 ) . thus , each self - similar solution @xmath58 provides an explicit example of a singularity developing in finite time from smooth initial data .    substituting the ansatz ( [ ssansatz ] ) into ( [ wave ] ) one obtains the ordinary differential equation @xmath59",
    "as explained in the introduction , because of the expected connections with the einstein equations , we are mainly interested in the lowest super - critical dimension @xmath11 . in this case equation ( [ sseq ] ) reduces to @xmath60 although the similarity coordinate @xmath61 is natural in the discussion of singularity formation , it has a disadvantage of not covering the region @xmath62 , in particular it does not extend to the future light cone of the point @xmath63 .",
    "for this reason we define a new coordinate @xmath64 which covers the whole spacetime : the past and the future light cones are located at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ; while the center @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( for @xmath62 ) . in terms of @xmath71 equation ( [ sseq5 ] ) becomes @xmath72 we first consider this equation inside the past light cone , that is for @xmath73 and impose the boundary conditions @xmath74 which follow from the demand of smoothness at the endpoints .",
    "as we shall see below , once a solution to this boundary value problem is constructed , its extension beyond the past light cone can be easily done .    to show that equation ( [ main ] ) admits solutions satisfying ( [ bc ] ) we shall employ a shooting technique .",
    "the main idea of this method is to replace the boundary value problem by the initial value problem with initial data imposed at one of the endpoints and then adjusting these data so that the solution hits the desired boundary value at the second endpoint . in the case at hand",
    "we shall shoot from @xmath65 towards infinity . substituting a formal power series expansion about @xmath65 into ( [ main ] )",
    "one finds the asymptotic behaviour @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a free parameter determining uniquely the whole series . in the following a solution of equation ( [ main ] ) starting at @xmath65 with the asymptotic behaviour ( [ aorbit ] )",
    "will be called an @xmath76-orbit . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath77 .",
    "we claim that there is a countable set of values @xmath78 for which the @xmath79-orbits exist for all @xmath80 and have the desired asymptotics at infinity ( such orbits will be called connecting ) .",
    "the proof consists of several steps .",
    "0.2 cm _ step  1 ( local existence)_. first , we need to show that @xmath76-orbits do in fact exist , that is , the series ( [ aorbit ] ) has a nonzero radius of convergence . since the point @xmath65 is singular , this fact does not follow from standard theorems . fortunately , in  @xcite breitelohner , forgcs , and maison have derived the following result concerning the behaviour of solutions of a system of ordinary differential equations near a singular point : 0.1 cm _ theorem [ bfm ] . consider a system of first order differential equations for @xmath81 functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath84 where constants @xmath85 and integers @xmath86 and let @xmath87 be an open subset of @xmath88 such that the functions @xmath89 and @xmath24 are analytic in the neighbourhood of @xmath90 for all @xmath91 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath16-parameter family of solutions of the system ( [ bfm ] ) such that @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are defined for all latexmath:[$c\\in c ,    0.1 cm    we shall make use of this theorem to prove the local existence of @xmath76-orbits . in order to put equation ( [ main ] ) into the form ( [ bfm2 ] ) we define the variables @xmath96 and get @xmath97}{2+y}.\\ ] ] since the function @xmath98 is analytic near @xmath99 for any @xmath100 and @xmath101 , according to the bfm theorem there exists a one - parameter family of local solutions such that @xmath102 transforming ( [ loc ] ) back to the original variables we obtain the behaviour of @xmath76-orbits . 0.2 cm _",
    "step  2 ( a priori global behaviour)_. it follows immediately from ( [ main ] ) that for @xmath103 a solution can not have a maximum ( resp .",
    "minimum ) for @xmath104 ( resp .",
    "@xmath105 ) . thus ,",
    "once the solution leaves the strip @xmath106 , it can not reenter it ( actually , such a solution becomes singular for a finite @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is also clear that as long as @xmath106 the solution can not go singular . to derive the asymptotics at infinity of @xmath76-orbits that stay in the strip @xmath106 we shall make use of the following functional @xmath107 for solutions of equation ( [ main ] ) we have @xmath108 so @xmath109 is monotone increasing .",
    "now , we shall show that solutions satisfying @xmath106 for all @xmath110 tend to @xmath111 as @xmath112 . to see this , first notice that for such solutions @xmath113 must be negative",
    "because if @xmath114 for some @xmath115 then @xmath116 is strictly positive for @xmath117 so the solution must leave the strip @xmath106 in finite time .",
    "since @xmath118 and @xmath119 , it follows that @xmath113 has a nonpositive limit at infinity which in turn implies by ( [ q ] ) that @xmath120 and by ( [ q ] ) that @xmath121 exists . by lhpital s rule we have @xmath122 and using ( [ main ] ) again",
    ", we get that @xmath123 equals @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "the latter is impossible because then @xmath126 is a global minimum contradicting the fact that @xmath113 increases .",
    "thus , @xmath127 .",
    "0.2 cm _ step  3 _ ( i ) ( _ behaviour of @xmath76-orbits for small @xmath76 _ ) .",
    "rescaling @xmath128 we get @xmath129 as @xmath130 , the solutions of this equation tend uniformly on compact intervals to the solution of the limiting equation @xmath131 with the same initial condition .",
    "this equation can be solved explicitly but for the purpose of the argument it suffices to notice that its solution , call it @xmath132 , is oscillating at infinity .",
    "since @xmath133 up to an arbitrarily large @xmath71 if @xmath76 is sufficiently small , it follows that the number of zeros of the solution @xmath134 tends to infinity as @xmath130 .",
    "0.1 cm ( ii ) ( _ behaviour of @xmath76-orbits for large @xmath76_. ) we rescale the variables , setting @xmath135 , @xmath136 to get @xmath137 as @xmath138 , the solutions of this equation tend uniformly on compact intervals to the solution @xmath139 of the limiting equation @xmath140 .",
    "thus , @xmath141 for large @xmath76 and therefore the @xmath76-orbit crosses @xmath142 for a finite @xmath71 .",
    "0.2 cm _ step  4 ( shooting argument)_. we define the set @xmath143 we know from step  3 that the set @xmath144 is nonempty ( because the @xmath76-orbits with large @xmath76 belong to it ) and bounded below ( because the @xmath76-orbits with small @xmath76 do not belong to it ) .",
    "thus @xmath145 exists . the solution @xmath146 can not cross the line @xmath142 at a finite @xmath71 because the same would be true for nearby solutions , violating the definition of @xmath147 .",
    "thus , @xmath148 for all @xmath71 and hence , by step  2 , @xmath149 .",
    "this completes the proof of existence of the nodeless self - similar solution @xmath150 .",
    "next , let us consider the solution with @xmath151 for small @xmath152 .",
    "by the definition of @xmath147 there must be a point @xmath153 where this solution attains a positive local maximum @xmath154 and since no minima are possible for @xmath155 , it follows that there must be a point @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath158 provided that @xmath159 is sufficiently small . as argued above this",
    "would imply that the solution @xmath134 leaves the strip @xmath106 via @xmath160 . from ( [ q ] )",
    "we have @xmath161 in order to estimate the last integral note that for @xmath117 @xmath162 so @xmath163 .",
    "substituting this into ( [ bla1 ] ) one gets @xmath164 the right hand side of this inequality is equal to @xmath165 for @xmath166 so , by continuity , it remains strictly positive for @xmath167 near @xmath168 . by taking a sufficiently small @xmath159",
    "we can have @xmath167 arbitrarily close to @xmath168 , hence @xmath169 which proves that @xmath76-orbits with @xmath151 have exactly one zero .",
    "this means that the set @xmath170 increases up to some @xmath153 where it attains a positive local maximum @xmath154 and then decreases monotonically up to some @xmath171 where @xmath172 is nonempty .",
    "let @xmath173 . by step  3 ,",
    "@xmath174 exists and is strictly positive .",
    "using the same argument as above we conclude that the @xmath174-orbit must stay in the region @xmath106 for all @xmath71 , hence @xmath175 .",
    "this completes the proof of existence of the self - similar solution @xmath176 with exactly one zero .",
    "the subsequent connecting orbits are obtained by induction .",
    "we conclude that there exists a countable family of self - similar solutions @xmath177 indexed by the integer @xmath178 @xmath16 which counts the number of zeros for @xmath103 .",
    "0.15 cm _ remark .",
    "_ since the sequence @xmath78 is decreasing and bounded below by zero , it has a nonnegative limit @xmath179 .",
    "if @xmath180 , then the @xmath181-orbit can not leave the region @xmath106 for a finite @xmath71 ( because the set of such orbits is clearly open ) hence it must be a connecting orbit with some finite number of zeros . but",
    "this contradicts the fact that the number of zeros of @xmath79-orbits increases with @xmath16 .",
    "hence , @xmath182 .",
    "this implies that for any finite @xmath71 , @xmath177 goes to zero when @xmath183 .",
    "0.15 cm we remark that the existence of the solution @xmath184 was first shown by cazenave , shatah , and tahvildar - zadeh  @xcite via a variational method .",
    "0.2 cm the shooting technique is not only a powerful analytical tool ; it is also an efficient numerical method of solving two - point boundary value problems .",
    "the numerical results produced by this method are shown in table  1 and figure  1 .",

    "the existence of the zero mode is due to the time translation symmetry , or in other words , the freedom of shifting the blowup time @xmath54 in ( [ ssansatz ] ) . to see this ,",
    "consider the self - similar solution with a shifted blowup time @xmath188 , where @xmath189 . in terms",
    "of the original similarity variables @xmath190 and @xmath191 , we have @xmath192 hence the perturbation generated by shifting the blowup time corresponds to @xmath7 and has the form @xmath193 an alternative way of deriving this result is to take @xmath194 , which is ( [ main ] ) reexpressed in terms of @xmath195 , differentiate it and compare with ( [ schr ] ) . since by construction the solution @xmath196 has @xmath16 extrema",
    ", it follows from ( [ zeromode ] ) that the zero mode @xmath197 has @xmath16 nodes .",
    "this implies , by the standard result from sturm - liouville theory , that the potential @xmath198 has exactly @xmath16 negative eigenvalues , in agreement with the numerical results shown in table  2 .",
    "we conclude that the self - similar solution @xmath186 has exactly @xmath16 unstable modes ( apart from the unphysical zero mode ) .",
    "in particular , the fundamental solution @xmath184 is linearly stable , which makes it a candidate for the attractor .",
    "the rest of this section is a digression concerning a striking regularity which an acute reader might have already noticed in table  2 . namely , the third column of table  2 indicates that for each @xmath199 the first eigenvalue below the continuous spectrum @xmath200 is equal to @xmath201 ( with the numerical accuracy of ten decimal places ) ! this puzzling numerical fact is calling for an explanation .",
    "clearly , it has something to do with the particular form of the nonlinearity since , for instance , the analogous problem for self - similar wave maps from @xmath0 dimensional minkowski spacetime into the 3-sphere does not have this property  @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the problem has some hidden symmetry , yet we can not exclude a possibility that the numerics is misleading and the eigenvalues @xmath202 are not precisely equal but their splitting is beyond the numerical resolution .",
    "some insight into this puzzle can be gained by analyzing the limiting case @xmath203 .",
    "recall that @xmath196 tends to zero for any @xmath204 as @xmath205 , hence the sequence of potentials @xmath198 has the following nonuniform limit @xmath206 for the limiting potential @xmath207 the schrdinger equation ( [ schr ] ) can be solved exactly .",
    "the solution that is admissible at infinity ( which as before is the limit - point ) is given by the associated legendre function of the first kind @xmath208 here @xmath209 is one of the roots of @xmath210 ; the second root gives the same solution because @xmath211 with real @xmath212 is real and @xmath213 .",
    "as @xmath214 , the solution ( [ uinf ] ) behaves as @xmath215 so it is always admissible , independently of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that @xmath216 is the limit - circle point and therefore in order to have a well - defined self - adjoint problem we need to impose an additional boundary condition . in the language of spectral theory such a condition is called a self - adjoint extension .",
    "the continuous part of the spectrum is the same for all self - adjoint extensions but the eigenvalues do depend on the choice . in our case",
    "the self - adjoint extension amounts to fixing @xmath217 - the phase of oscillations of the eigenfunctions for @xmath214 .",
    "the natural choice is to require that the eigenfunctions oscillate with the same phase as the zero mode , that is @xmath218 , or equivalently @xmath219 note that under this condition the following diagram commutes @xmath220 substituting ( [ uinf ] ) into ( [ exten ] ) and using the asymptotic expansion ( for real @xmath212 ) @xmath221 we obtain the quantization condition for the eigenvalues @xmath222 this transcendental equation has infinitely many roots which for @xmath223 can be obtained only numerically ( see the last row in table  2 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath224 the exact solution is @xmath225 because ( accidentally ? ) @xmath226 , as can be readily verified using four times the identity @xmath227 .",
    "thus , we showed that the least negative eigenvalue of the limiting potential is equal to @xmath201 .",

    "having learned about self - similar solutions , we are now prepared to understand the results of numerical studies , first reported in  @xcite , of the cauchy problem for the ym equation in five space dimensions @xmath236 the main goal of these studies was to determine the asymptotics of blowup .",
    "our numerical simulations were based on finite difference methods combined with adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "the latter were instrumental in resolving the structure of singularities developing on vanishingly small scales .",
    "we stress that a priori analytical insight into the problem , in particular the knowledge of self - similar solutions was very helpful in interpreting the numerical results .",
    "we solved equation ( [ wave5 ] ) for a variety of initial conditions interpolating between small and large data .",
    "a typical example of such initial data is a gaussian ( ingoing or time - symmetric ) of the form @xmath237,\\ ] ] with adjustable amplitude @xmath238 and fixed parameters @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the global behaviour of solutions is qualitatively the same for all families of initial data and depends critically on the amplitude @xmath238 ( or any other parameter which controls the `` strength '' of initial data ) . for small amplitudes",
    "the solutions disperse , that is the energy is radiated away to infinity and in any compact region the solution approaches the vacuum solution @xmath241 .",
    "this is in agreement with general theorems on global existence for small initial data  @xcite .",
    "heuristically , this follows from the fact the for a small amplitude the nonlinearity is dominated by the dispersive effect of the linear wave operator . for large amplitudes",
    "we observe the development of two clearly separated regions : an outer region where the evolution is very slow and a rapidly evolving inner region where the solution attains a kink - like shape which shrinks in a self - similar manner to zero size in a finite time @xmath54 .",
    "the kink is , of course , nothing else but the self - similar solution @xmath242 ( rather than @xmath71 ) and abuse the notation by writing @xmath243 to denote @xmath244 . ]",
    "( see figure  3 ) .",
    "we summarize these findings in the following conjecture :    _ solutions of equation ( [ wave5 ] ) corresponding to sufficiently large initial data do blow up in finite time in the sense that @xmath245 diverges as @xmath246 for some @xmath247 .",
    "the universal asymptotic profile of blowup is given by the stable self - similar solution : _",
    "@xmath248    we think that the basic mechanism which is responsible for the observed asymptotic self - similarity of blowup can be viewed as the convergence to the lowest `` energy '' configuration . to see this ,",

    "the question is what happens in between . using bisection",
    ", we found that along each interpolating family of initial data there is a threshold value of the parameter , say the amplitude @xmath254 , below which the solutions disperse and above which a singularity is formed .",
    "the evolution of initial data near the threshold was found to go through a transient phase which is universal , i.e. the same for all families .",
    "this intermediate attractor was identified as the self - similar solution @xmath255 .",
    "having gone through this transient phase , at the end the solutions leave the intermediate attractor towards dispersal or blowup .",
    "this behaviour is shown in figure  4 for the time - symmetric initial data of the form ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "0.15 cm    the universality of the dynamics at the threshold of singularity formation can be understood heuristically as follows . as we showed above",
    ", the self - similar solution @xmath255 has exactly one unstable mode  in other words the stable manifold of this solution has codimension one and therefore generic one - parameter families of initial data do intersect it .",
    "the points of intersection correspond to critical initial data that converge asymptotically to @xmath255 .",
    "the marginally critical data , by continuity , initially remain close to the stable manifold and approach @xmath255 for intermediate times but eventually are repelled from its vicinity along the one - dimensional unstable manifold ( see figure  5 ) .        according to this picture the universality of the nearly critical dynamics follows immediately from the fact that the same unstable mode dominates the evolution of all solutions .",
    "more precisely , the evolution of marginally critical solutions in the intermediate asymptotics can be approximated as @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the single unstable mode with the eigenvalue @xmath225 .",
    "the small constant @xmath258 , which is the only vestige of the initial data , quantifies an admixture of the unstable mode  for precisely critical data @xmath259 .",
    "the time of departure from the intermediate attractor is determined by the time @xmath260 in which the unstable mode grows to a finite size , i.e. , @xmath261 .",
    "using @xmath262 and substituting @xmath225 , we get @xmath263 .",
    "various scaling laws can be derived from this .",
    "for example , consider solutions with marginally sub - threshold amplitudes @xmath264 .",
    "for such solutions the energy density @xmath265 initially grows at the center , attains a maximum at a certain time @xmath266 and then drops to zero . substituting ( [ inter ] ) into ( [ density ] )",
    "we get that @xmath267 , and hence @xmath268 .",
    "the behaviour of solutions near the threshold of singularity formation described above shares many features with critical phenomena at the threshold of black hole formation in gravitational collapse . to explain these similarities",
    ", we now briefly recall the phenomenology and heuristics of the critical gravitational collapse . consider a spherical shell of matter and let it collapse under its own weight .",
    "the dynamics of this process , modelled by einstein s equations , can be understood intuitively in terms of the competition between gravitational attraction and repulsive internal forces ( due , for instance , to kinetic energy of matter or pressure ) .",
    "if the initial configuration is dilute , then the repulsive forces `` win '' and the collapsing matter will rebound or implode through the center , and eventually will disperse .",
    "on the other hand , if the density of matter is sufficiently large , some fraction of the initial mass will form a black hole .",
    "critical gravitational collapse occurs when the attracting and repulsive forces governing the dynamics of this process are almost in balance , or in other words , the initial configuration is near the threshold of black hole formation .",
    "the systematic studies of critical gravitational collapse were launched in the early nineties by the seminal paper by choptuik @xcite in which he investigated numerically the collapse of a self - gravitating massless scalar field .",
    "evolving initial data fine - tuned to the border between no - black - hole and black - hole spacetimes , choptuik found the following unforseen phenomena near the threshold : + ( i ) universality : all initial data which are near the black hole threshold go through a universal transient period in their evolution during which they approach a certain intermediate attractor , before eventually dispersing or forming a black hole .",
    "this universal intermediate attractor is usually referred to as the critical solution .",
    "+ ( ii ) discrete self - similarity : the critical solution is discretely self - similar , that is it is invariant under dilations by a certain fixed factor @xmath269 called the echoing period .",
    "+ ( iii ) black - hole mass scaling : for initial data that do form black holes , the masses of black holes satisfy the power law @xmath270 where @xmath159 is the distance to the threshold and @xmath271 is a universal ( i.e. , the same for all initial data ) critical exponent . thus , by fine tuning to the threshold one can make an arbitrarily tiny black hole .",
    "put differently , there is no mass gap at the transition between black - hole and no - black - hole spacetimes .    what choptuik found for the scalar field , has been later observed in many other models of gravitational collapse , although the symmetry of the critical solution itself was found to depend on the model : in some cases the critical solution is self - similar ( continuously or discretely ) , while in other cases the critical solution is static ( or periodic ) . in the latter case",
    "black hole formation turns on with finite mass .",
    "these two kinds of critical behaviour are referred to as the the type ii or type i criticality , respectively , to emphasize the formal analogy with second and first order phase transitions in statistical physics .",
    "we refer the interested reader to  @xcite for an excellent review of the growing literature on critical gravitational collapse .",
    "the present understanding of critical behaviour in gravitational collapse is based on the same phase space picture as in figure  5 , that is , it is associated with the existence of a critical solution with exactly one unstable mode .",
    "this picture leads to some quantitative predictions .",
    "in particular , in the case of type ii critical collapse , an elementary dimensional analysis shows that the critical exponent @xmath271 in the power law @xmath272 is a reciprocal of the unstable eigenvalue of the critical solution .    by now",
    ", the similarities between type ii critical gravitational collapse and the dynamics at the threshold of singularity formation in the @xmath273 ym equations should be evident .",
    "this analogy , together with similar results for wave maps in @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite ,  @xcite , shows that the basic properties of critical collapse , such as universality , scaling , and self - similarity , first observed for einstein s equations , actually have nothing to do with gravity and seem to be robust properties of supercritical nonlinear wave equations .",
    "the obvious advantage of toy models , such as the one presented in this paper , is their simplicity which allowed to get a much better analytic grip on critical phenomena than in the case of einstein s equations ; in particular , it was possible to prove existence of the critical solution .",
    "the only characteristic property of type ii critical collapse which so far has not found in simpler models ( besides , of course , the absence of black holes which are replaced by singularities ) is discrete self - similarity of the critical solution",
    ". it would be very interesting to design a toy model which exhibits discrete self - similarity at the threshold for singularity formation because this could give us insight into the origin of this mysterious symmetry .",
    "in this section we consider the cauchy problem for the ym equation in four space dimensions @xmath274 we begin by recalling some facts concerning equation ( [ wave4 ] ) which are be important in understanding the dynamics of singularity formation .",
    "first , we note that , in contrast to @xmath11 , there are no smooth self - similar solution in @xmath19 .",
    "this follows from the fact that in @xmath43 dimensions the local solutions of equation ( [ sseq ] ) near the past light cone behave as @xmath275 , hence they are not smooth if @xmath43 is even ( in particular , they are not differentiable in @xmath19 ) .",
    "although such singular self - similar solutions do exist , they can not develop from smooth initial data and therefore they are not expected to participate in the dynamics .",
    "second , @xmath19 is the critical dimension in the sense that the energy ( [ energy ] ) does not change under scaling .",
    "this means that , even though the model is scale invariant , a nontrivial finite energy static solution may exist the ym coupling constant @xmath276 provides the scale of energy . ] .",
    "in fact , such a static solution is well known @xmath277 this is the instanton in the four - dimensional euclidean ym theory . of course , by reflection symmetry , @xmath278 is also the solution .",
    "since the model is scale invariant , the solution @xmath279 generates an orbit of static solutions @xmath280 , where @xmath281 .    to analyze the linear stability of the instanton , we insert @xmath282 into ( [ wave4 ] ) and linearize . in this way",
    "we get the eigenvalue problem ( the radial schrdinger equation ) @xmath283 this problem has a zero eigenvalue @xmath284 which follows from scale invariance .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction ( so called zero mode ) is determined by the perturbation generated by scaling @xmath285 since the zero mode @xmath286 has no nodes , it follows by the standard result from sturm - liouville theory that there are no negative eigenvalues , and _ eo ipso _ no unstable modes around @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the instanton is marginally stable .",
    "note that the zero eigenvalue lies at the bottom of the continuous spectrum @xmath287 , hence there is no spectral gap in the problem .    after these preliminaries , we return to the discussion of the cauchy problem for equation ( [ wave4 ] ) . for small energies the solutions disperse , in agreement with general theorems . for large energies , at first sight",
    "the global behaviour seems similar to the @xmath11 case  as before , near the center the solution attains the form of a kink which shrinks to zero size .",
    "however , this similarity is superficial because now the kink is not a self - similar solution ( as no such solution exists ) .",
    "it turns out ( see figure  6 ) that the kink has the form of the _ scale - evolving _",
    "instanton @xmath288 where a scaling factor @xmath289 is a positive function which tends to zero as @xmath290 .",
    "we summarize these findings in the following conjecture :    _ solutions of equation ( [ wave4 ] ) with sufficiently large energy do blow up in finite time in the sense that @xmath245 diverges as @xmath246 for some @xmath247 .",
    "the universal asymptotic profile of blowup is given by the instanton .",
    "more precisely , there exists a positive function @xmath291 for @xmath292 such that _",
    "the key question which is left open in this conjecture is : what determines the evolution of the scaling factor @xmath289 ; in particular , what is the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath289 for @xmath290 ? numerical evidence shown in figure  7 suggests that the rate of blowup goes asymptotically to zero , that is ( @xmath294 ) @xmath295 but it seems very hard to determine an exact asymptotics of @xmath289 from pure numerics .",
    "recently , an analytical approach to this problem has been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "below we sketch the main idea of this approach .",
    "let @xmath296 be a manifold of rescaled instantons ( a one - dimensional center manifold ) .",
    "assuming that a solution is in a neighbourhood of @xmath297 , we decompose it as @xmath298 here @xmath101 represents a small deviation of the solution from @xmath297 and @xmath299 is the collective coordinate on @xmath297 . to fix the splitting between these two parts we require that @xmath300 , where @xmath301 is the projection on @xmath297 .",
    "plugging ( [ decomp ] ) into ( [ wave4 ] ) we get ( @xmath302 ) @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the linear perturbation operator about the instanton @xmath305 and @xmath306 it is clear from ( [ main2 ] ) that @xmath307 , hence for @xmath101 to decay to zero as @xmath290 , the rate of blowup must go to zero as well .",
    "we stress this point to emphasize that the linear evolution of @xmath289 , predicted for example by the geodesic approximation , is inconsistent with conjecture  2 .",
    "next , by projecting equation ( [ main2 ] ) on @xmath297 and in the orthogonal direction , we get a coupled system consisting of a nonhomogeneous wave equation for @xmath101 and an ordinary differential equation for @xmath299 . solving the first equation for @xmath101 and plugging the result into the second equation , we obtain in the lowest order the following modulation equation @xmath308 from this we get the leading order asymptotics for @xmath309 @xmath310 as shown in figure  7 this result is in rough agreement with numerics .",
    "there are many possible sources of the apparent discrepancy . on the numerical side",
    "there are discretization errors , an error in estimating the blowup time , or errors in computing @xmath299 from the data . on the analytical side",
    ", there might be corrections to ( [ sigal ] ) coming from the bounded region expansion and , more importantly , from the far field behaviour ) is not quite straightforward because of the presence of infrared divergencies which need to be regularized . ] .",
    "finally , and in our opinion most likely reason of discrepancy is that the solution shown in figure  7 has not yet reached the truly asymptotic regime and consequently the higher order corrections to formula ( [ sigal ] ) are still significant .",
    "the issue of blowup rate is closely related to the problem of energy concentration in the singularity . to explain this",
    ", we define the kinetic and the potential energies at time @xmath69 inside the past light cone of the singularity @xmath311 substituting ( [ adiabatic ] ) into ( [ energy_cone ] ) we obtain @xmath312 assuming ( [ rate ] ) , this implies that @xmath313 thus , the energy equal to the energy of the instanton gets concentrated in the singularity .",
    "this means that in the process of blowup the excess energy must be radiated away from the inner region as the solution converges to the instanton .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the concentration of energy is a necessary condition for blowup in the critical dimension . to see this ,",
    "suppose that the solution blows up at time t and assume for contradiction that @xmath314 .",
    "then , by choosing a sufficiently small @xmath152 we can have @xmath315 arbitrarily small .",
    "this implies , by causality and global existence for small energy data , that the solution exists globally in time , contradicting the assumption . for radial equations of the type @xmath316 a stronger result",
    "was proved by struwe  @xcite who basically showed that if the solution of ( [ struwe ] ) blows up , then it must do so in the manner described in conjecture  2 . in this sense formation of singularities",
    "is intimately tied with the existence of a static solution .",
    "finally , we address briefly the issue of the threshold of singularity formation . using the technique described in section  5 , along each interpolating family of initial data",
    "we can determine the critical point separating blowup from dispersal .",
    "however , in contrast to the @xmath11 case , we see no evidence for the existence of an intermediate attractor in the evolution of nearly critical data .",
    "this fact , together with a similar result for @xmath317 dimensional wave maps  @xcite suggests that in the critical dimension the transition between blowup and dispersal is not governed by any critical solution .",
    "we suspect that the evolution of precisely critical initial data still has the form ( [ adiabatic ] ) but the dynamics of the scaling factor is different than in ( [ sigal ] ) .",
    "this belief is based on the fact that in the evolution of marginally critical initial data we can clearly distinguish a transient phase during which @xmath289 drops very quickly and then , either reaches a minimum and starts growing ( in the case of dispersal ) , or keeps decreasing with the `` normal '' rate ( in the case of blowup ) .",
    "there are two main lessons that we wanted to convey in this survey .",
    "the first lesson is that there are striking analogies between major evolution equations . in particular ,",
    "the mechanism of blowup to a large extent is determined by the criticality class of the model .",
    "these analogies can be used to get insight into hard problems ( such as singularity formation for einstein s equations ) by studying toy models which belong to the _ same _ criticality class .",
    "this approach is in the spirit of general philosophy expressed by david hilbert in his famous lecture delivered before the international congress of mathematicians at paris in 1900  @xcite : _ `` in dealing with mathematical problems , specialization plays , as i believe , a still more important part than generalization .",
    "perhaps in most cases where we seek in vain the answer to a question , the cause of the failure lies in the fact that problems simpler and easier than the one in hand have been either not at all or incompletely solved .",
    "all depends , then , on finding out these easier problems , and on solving them by means of devices as perfect as possible and of concepts capable of generalization . '' _",
    "the second lesson is concerned with the interplay between numerical and analytical techniques .",
    "accurate and reliable numerical simulation of singular behaviour is difficult and hard to assess . in order to keep track of a singularity developing on exceedingly small spatio - temporal scales , one needs sophisticated techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement . for these techniques the convergence and error analysis are lacking so",
    "extreme care is needed to make sure that the computed singularities are not numerical artifacts .",
    "for this reason , in order to feel confident about numerics it is important to have some analytical information , like existence of self - similar solutions . without a theory ,",
    "simulations alone do not provide ample evidence for the existence of a singularity .",
    "we believe that the interaction between numerical and analytical techniques , illustrated here by the studies of blowup , will become more and more important in future as we begin to attack more difficult problems .",
