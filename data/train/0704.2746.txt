    "neutral - ionic phase transitions ( nit ) are pressure or temperature induced valence instabilities occurring in mixed stack charge - transfer ( ct ) crystals , where @xmath0-electron donor ( d ) and acceptor ( a ) molecules alternate along the stack direction.@xcite nit are known since long time,@xcite but the microscopic origin of the many intriguing phenomena accompanying the transition is still controversial . for instance , the dielectric constant and conductivity anomalies have been ascribed to the presence of nanoscopic , mobile objects , the lattice relaxed neutral - ionic domain walls ( nidw ) , also referred as lattice relaxed charge - transfer exciton strings ( lrct).@xcite on the other hand , the dielectric constant anomaly can be well accounted for by the charge oscillations induced by the peierls mode,@xcite since the ionic stack is subject to peierls instability.@xcite another intriguing aspect of nit is indeed associated with the dimerization peierls instability , since dimerized ionic stacks are potentially ferroelectric .",
    "tetrathiafulvalene - chloranil ( ttf - ca ) nit is by far the most widely studied , also because it can be induced both by temperature @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2",
    ". the ambient pressure @xmath1-induced transition occurs at @xmath3= 81 k , is first order , and has been well characterized by a series of structural and spectroscopic studies , whose list is too long to be reported here.@xcite    at @xmath3 , the average charge on the molecular sites ( ionicity , @xmath4 ) jumps from about 0.3 to over 0.5 , the latter value being considered the borderline between neutral ( _ n _ ) and ionic ( _ i _ ) phases . the ionicity jump is accompanied by the stack dimerization .",

    "the ttf - ca @xmath2-induced transition has been comparatively less studied .",
    "early infrared ( ir ) spectra of the powders showed that above @xmath5 1.1 gpa the phase is ionic and dimerized , similarly to the low-@xmath1 phase.@xcite on the other hand , preliminary x - ray measurements , never published in complete form , suggested that the @xmath2-induced transition is different from the @xmath1-induced one , occurring through some sort of `` intermediate transition region '' , from about 0.65 to 1.1 gpa.@xcite this finding has been confirmed by several spectroscopic data,@xcite but without agreement about the nature of this intermediate transition region .",
    "several authors suggested that species of different ionicity were present , but the degree of ionicity was highly uncertain .",
    "also the pressure interval of the coexistence region varied depending on the type of measurement.@xcite the use of powdered samples is certainly one of the reasons of such uncertainties , as for instance ir spectra are more difficult to interpret in the lack of polarization information .",
    "moreover , it is known that the nit is affected by the presence of defects , and these certainly dominate in powdered samples . in any case , qualitative phase diagrams started to emerge , @xcite based on measurements in which both @xmath1 and @xmath2 were simultaneously changed . according to these studies , both neutral and ionic species coexist in the intermediate regime .    the first detailed study of the phase diagram , performed through neutron diffraction and nqr on ttf - ca single crystals,@xcite definitely evidenced a bifurcation of the _ n - i _ crossing line at a triple point located around 210 k and 0.5 gpa . according to these authors , the intermediate regime arising above the triple point",
    "has to be interpreted as a paraelectric phase , separating the ionic and dimerized ( ferroelectric ) from the neutral and regular stack phase . in other words ,",
    "the intermediate regime is interpreted as a true thermodynamic phase , where dynamically disordered lrct are present . the condensation and ordering of lrct , driven by interstack interactions , yields the ferroelectric phase .",
    "evidence of lrct was thought to be provided by ir spectra.@xcite however , by using combined single crystal ir and raman data , some of us have shown that the apparent signatures of lrct in the @xmath1-induced nit are actually due to the peierls mode.@xcite for this reason we have decided to re - investigate the @xmath2-induced transition of ttf - ca by the same methods , namely , combined single crystal raman and polarized ir data . a first set of experiments , focalized on the ir spectra polarized perpendicular to the stack , have clearly shown that two species of different ionicity are present in the intermediate transition region.@xcite in pressure experiments particular care has to be paid to pressure homogeneity on the sample , and before publishing a full paper we have carefully repeated the experiment , adding also measurements with polarization parallel to the stack . in the meantime , an independent paper has appeared , reporting single crystal optical spectra as a function of pressure.@xcite the reported ir spectra confirm our earlier experiment , but the interpretation is quite different from ours .    in the present paper",
    "we report the complete ir absorption spectra of ttf - ca single crystal , together with raman spectra collected at the same pressures .",
    "we confirm that between 0.86 and 1.24 gpa species with different ionicity are simultaneously present .",

    "very thin single crystals suitable for infrared ( ir ) absorption have been obtained by subliming ttf - ca under reduced pressure.@xcite thicker samples have been used for the raman measurements .",
    "the crystals present significant dichroism in white light transmission : they appear green when light is polarized parallel to the stack axis _ a _ , and yellow for light polarized perpendicular to the stack .",

    "the samples have been inserted in either stainless - steel or copper gaskets , the latter allowing finer tuning at low to moderate pressures ( up to 1.5 gpa ) .",

    "two bands at 1655 and at 1542 @xmath6 ( spectrum at 0.05 gpa ) are clearly observed , and can be safely assigned to the @xmath8 c = o and the @xmath9 c = c stretching modes of the ca molecular components , respectively .",
    "@xcite both c = o and c = c bonds are strongly affected by the @xmath0-electronic structure of the molecule and lose part of their bond order when an electron is added .",
    "for this reason both vibrational modes are sensitive to the effective charge localized on the molecules , _",
    "i.e. _ ,   the ionicity .",
    "in particular the @xmath8 c = o band is very useful to study the nit valence instability , and can be used to accurately probe ionicity in view of its large frequency shift in going from the fully neutral ca@xmath10 ( @xmath11 @xmath6 ) to the fully ionic ca@xmath12 molecule ( @xmath13 @xmath6 ) .@xcite    from fig.[f : fig1 ] it is evident that the @xmath8 c = o band displays an anomalous behavior with increasing pressure .",

    "ionicity increases gradually from @xmath4 = 0.19 up to @xmath4 = 0.47 at 0.86 gpa . applying pressure",
    "further a small discontinuity occurs .",
    "the ttf - ca system crosses the _",

    "an intermediate regime develops , where molecular species with two different ionicity , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , coexist .",
    "@xmath15 slightly increases from @xmath17 up to @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is almost constant .",
    "these two different ionicities correspond to the two components , a and b , of the splitted band structure in fig.[f : fig1 ] , and the evolution of their relative intensities allows one to follow the concentrations , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of the two molecular species ( @xmath22 ) . the two species have variable concentration as demonstrated by fig [ f : fig2](b ) , where @xmath21 , estimated from the relative intensity of the b band , is plotted as a function of pressure .",
    "the concentration @xmath21 increases from 0.86 up to 1.24 gpa , and above this pressure only @xmath14 molecules with @xmath23 are present .    in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]c we report the pressure evolution of the bandwidth of the @xmath8 c = o band . here",
    "the discontinuity between 0.86 and 0.90 gpa in crossing the _ n - i _ borderline , is much clearer .",
    "also notice the steep increase of bandwidth when approaching the coexistence region , indicative of a precursor regime with strong dynamic disorder .",
    "we remark that the pressure dependence of the @xmath9 c = c band at 1542 @xmath6 , marked with solid circles in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , is perfectly consistent with that of the @xmath8 c = o band .",
    "the frequency softening , followed by a gradual loss of intensity , indicates that ionicity smoothly increases up to 0.86 gpa . above this pressure , when the system has shifted to the ionic side ( @xmath24 ) , this band can not be detected anymore in our spectra .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the fact that in ca@xmath12 the description of this vibrational mode in terms of c = c stretching changes drastically , and its ir intensity falls down almost completely.@xcite    the above arguments validate our analysis of the 1500 - 1700 @xmath6 spectral region and rule out the alternative interpretation proposed by matsuzaki _ et al._,@xcite based on the incorrect assignment of the b band in fig .  [",

    "finally we notice that the occurrence of the coexistence phase has been carefully checked by repeated pressure cycling on different ttf - ca samples",
    ". we can also rule out pressure inhomogeneity across the sample , since we have checked that raman micro - spectroscopy , with a spatial resolution of about 5 @xmath25 m , gives identical spectra throughout the whole sample .",
    "moreover open circles in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]a , representing experimental points taken on releasing pressure from 3.2 gpa , indicate that this phase is fully reversible and that hysteresis effects have not been detected .",
    "at room temperature and at ambient pressure ttf - ca crystallizes in the @xmath26 space group with two formula units per cell.@xcite the ttf and ca molecules alternate with uniform distance along the crystallographic @xmath27 axis , each molecule residing on inversion symmetry center .",
    "the temperature induced nit is accompanied by a dimerization instability , and at low temperature the space group is @xmath28 , with two dimerized stack per unit cell.@xcite    it is well known that ir spectroscopy with light polarized parallel to the stack direction is a powerful method to study the dimerization instabilities in ct crystals.@xcite the loss of the inversion symmetry associated with the stack dimerization makes the raman active totally - symmetric molecular vibrations also ir active .",
    "the totally - symmetric modes are coupled to ct electrons ( _ e - mv _ coupling ) , and in ir they borrow huge intensity from the nearby electronic ct transition , with polarization parallel to the stacks .",
    "one can therefore discriminate between dimerized and uniform stack structure on the basis of the presence or absence of these characteristic ir bands ( `` vibronic bands'').@xcite    ) .",

    "ttf - ca spectra in the neutral , uniform stack phase are indeed characterized by the presence of two - phonon excitations ( ir `` side - bands '' ) , whose temperature evolution probes the energy of the soft mode involved in the stack distortion.@xcite    to investigate these structural and pretransitional phenomena of pressure induced nit of ttf - ca , we have collected ir spectra polarized parallel to the stack axis as a function of pressure ( fig .  [ f : fig3 ] ) .",
    "three strong bands , marked by a triangle , square and circle in the figure , clearly develop above @xmath5 0.6 gpa . these vibronic bands are assigned to the most strongly _ e - mv _ coupled totally - symmetric modes , namely the ca   @xmath29 @xmath30 around 980 @xmath6 , and the ttf @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 modes around 1350 and 1540 @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "their presence reflects the fact that dimerization is taking place on increasing pressure.@xcite    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] we report the pressure dependence of the normalized ir intensity of the ca @xmath29 @xmath30 mode . this mode starts to appear as a broad weak band above 0.6 gpa and rapidly gain intensity reaching its maximum value around 1.0 gpa , a slight intensity decrease follows on increasing pressure further .",
    "the behavior of the other vibronic bands is qualitatively similar to this one , although it is not possible to carefully follow their intensity evolution , because the ttf @xmath29 @xmath30 band is partially covered by absorption of the pressure transmitting medium , while the @xmath29 @xmath31 band at 1540 @xmath6 occurs in a region overlapped by other fundamental vibrational bands .    the comparison between the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] with fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]a seems to indicate that the dimerization and valence instability are not correlated in the pressure induced nit of ttf - ca .",
    "the onset of dimerization appears to be around 0.6 gpa , reaching saturation at 1.0 gpa , whereas the double ionicity region starts at 0.86 and extends to about 1.24 gpa .",
    "however , in addition to the ir intensity of the ca @xmath29 @xmath30 mode , one has to consider its bandshape , and make a proper comparison with the corresponding raman band .",
    "to such aim , we report in fig .  [",

    "[ f : fig4 ] starting from low pressures .",
    "below 0.68 gpa we can easily identify the so - called side - bands , namely ir bands occurring above and below the @xmath29 @xmath30 raman band .",
    "the side - bands are clearly due to sum and difference two - phonon excitations between the raman active molecular vibration and a low frequency lattice mode also coupled with the ct electrons . in the temperature induced transition of ttf - ca , the side - bands provide useful information on the soft mode which drives the dimerization instability , namely , the peierls mode.@xcite at ambient conditions the side - bands are separated by about 70 @xmath6 from the central raman band . at 0.39 gpa , the distance is about 50 @xmath6 , approximately as in the 150 k spectrum at ambient pressure . in our experiments",
    "ir side bands can be clearly identified up to about 0.52 gpa , and disappear , merging in an unique broad band on further increasing pressure .",
    "indeed , above @xmath5 0.6 we observe the development of a single vibronic ir band due to the ca @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "this band is initially very broad ( almost 100 @xmath6 ) , with the maximum occurring at a frequency _ lower _ than the corresponding raman band . as the pressure increases , the vibronic band sharpens and its frequency moves upwards , approaching the value of the raman band . around @xmath5 0.9 gpa ( but it is difficult to set a precise pressure , as we are comparing ir and raman bandshapes ) we start to see coincidence between the ir vibronic and the raman band , perfect matching occurring at 1.0 gpa and above .",
    "the lack of ir and raman frequency coincidence proves that the loss of the inversion symmetry is not complete along the stack , although some kind of local stack distortion has already taken place .",
    "this phenomenon is indicative of a new regime established between @xmath5 0.6 gpa and @xmath5 0.9 gpa and dominated by dynamic disorder .",
    "notice that in this pressure range also the ir spectra polarized perpendicular to the stack show evidence of strong dynamic disorder ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]c ) . the ir spectra polarized perpendicularly to the stack show that above @xmath5 0.86 gpa we enter in a regime characterized by a double ionicity .",
    "this pressure is approximately the same in which we start to see coincidence between raman and ir vibronic bands , both of which display a clear doublet structure .",
    "this regime is then characterized by comparable domains of different ionicity , and around 1.0 gpa we can affirm that the stacks are in any case fully dimerized , since the intensity of the vibronic bands saturates ( inset of fig .  [",
    "f : fig3 ] ) .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the double ionicity regime gradually evolves towards a single ionicity , which is finally reached above @xmath5 1.24 gpa .",
    "as already stated , ttf - ca @xmath1-induced nit at ambient pressure is well characterized .",
    "it is a first order transition with a discontinuous @xmath4 jump from @xmath5 0.3 to just over 0.5 , and a simultaneous dimerization of the stacks .",
    "the dimerization is anticipated by a critical softening of an effective peierls mode which proves the displacive nature of the structural phase transition.@xcite on the other hand , the evolution of ttf - ca @xmath2-induced nit is more complex , actually more than it has been thought so far .",
    "the @xmath2-induced nit is less discontinuous than the @xmath1-induced one , but is still first order since a weak discontinuity in the @xmath33 curve is observed between 0.86 and 0.9 gpa ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]a ) .",
    "actually , if we follow the pressure evolution of the ionicity @xmath4 , three different regimes are identified . a neutral phase ( @xmath34 ) at low pressure , a coexistence phase between 0.86 and 1.24 gpa , characterized by species of two different ionicities , and a ionic phase ( @xmath4 @xmath5 0.7 ) at high pressures .    in the neutral phase the ionicity grows continuously with pressure , and reaches @xmath4 = 0.47 at 0.86 gpa , the transition pressure . however , strong pretransitional phenomena related to both the valence and the structural instability start already above @xmath5 0.6 gpa , when the ionicity is about 0.3 .",
    "first , the bandwidth of the modes most sensitive to @xmath4 shows a sharp increase with @xmath2 , starting above 0.6 gpa and reaching the maximum at the critical pressure @xmath35 = 0.86 gpa ( fig .  [",
    "f : fig2]c ) .",
    "second , approximately in the same pressure interval , the ir spectra polarized parallel to the stack are characterized by vibronic bands , corresponding to the activation in ir of intramolecular totally - symmetric modes .",
    "the activation , with appreciable intensity due to the coupling to the ct electrons , is the signature of a dimerization distortion .",
    "however , completely dimerized stacks would lead to ir - raman frequency coincidence , due to the loss of the inversion symmetry along the stacks .",
    "ir - raman frequency coincidence is _ not _ observed in the pressure interval we are considering ( figs .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] and  [ f : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this finding can be rationalized in terms of localized distortions , most likely fluctuating in time and space , on the average preserving the inversion symmetry . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath2-induced phase transition at room @xmath1 is preceded by a _ precursor regime",
    "_ characterized by fluctuating dimerized domains with variable @xmath4 in the predominantly neutral and regular stack phase .",
    "the fluctuating behavior fades around @xmath35 = 0.86 gpa , as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]c , and ttf - ca develops an intermediate phase which persists up to 1.24 gpa . in this pressure range the @xmath8 c = o band , which probes the ionicity , shows a well resolved doublet structure ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) , the ir intensity of the vibronic bands reaches the maximum value and frequency matching between ir and raman bands is definitely established ( figs .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] and  [ f : fig4 ] ) .",
    "these experimental findings indicate that the intermediate phase is characterized from the structural point of view by the lack of inversion symmetry , and from the electronic point of view by the coexistence of species with different ionicity , @xmath36 and @xmath19 .",
    "the intensity evolution of the c = o doublet shows that the @xmath15 component gradually converts into the more ionic one , @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig2]b ) .",
    "we then argue that this phase is not a well defined , ordered phase with a spatially modulated ionicity parameter , but is properly described in terms of a static disordered phase where species with two different ionicity coexist .",
    "on increasing pressure further , coexistence is smoothly suppressed and , above 1.24 gpa , ttf - ca is ionic ( @xmath23 ) and dimerized similarly to the low-@xmath1 ferroelectric phase .",
    "we do not detect discontinuities or significant spectral changes , besides the vanishing of the @xmath15 species in favor of the more ionic @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , we suggest that the phase transformation from the intermediate to the final ionic phase occurs continuously through a disorder - order type mechanism . 0.5 cm    , variable @xmath2.,width=7 ]    fig .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] reports a sketch of the just described ttf - ca phase evolution on increasing @xmath2 at ambient temperature .",
    "several hypotheses have been formulated about the nature of the intermediate regime between the neutral , regular and the ionic dimerized stack phase . up to now",
    ", the most credited idea has been that of a `` paraelectric '' phase , dominated by fluctuating , disordered lrct , which precede and induce the tridimensional ordering to the ferroelectric ( ionic and dimerized ) phase.@xcite our results suggest that we have a precursor regime , with fluctuations ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] ) , _ and _ a new phase , characterized by the simultaneous presence of two different ionicities , which precedes the ferroelectric phase .",
    "we believe that thermally accessible low - lying excitations such as lrct @xcite are present in the precursor regime between @xmath5 0.6 and @xmath5 0.86 gpa .",
    "other experimental data are in support of this idea .",

    "the boundaries of the precursor regime appear slightly wider than those reported in fig .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "such boundaries can not be sharp , and electronic data are more sensitive than vibrational ones .",
    "dielectric response as a function of pressure shows anomalies in the relaxation frequency , starting at about 0.5 gpa ( the data extend only to 0.7 gpa).@xcite furthermore , the dc conductivity increases exponentially with @xmath2 , the maximum value being reached at about 0.87 gpa,@xcite the critical pressure for the insurgence of the @xmath37 phase .",

    "lrct have been invoked in both cases,@xcite but actually the experimental results are different , and can be interpreted in a different way .",
    "for instance , by lowering the temperature the dielectric constant shows a dramatic increase as @xmath3 = 81 k is approached , whereas the @xmath2 variation is less remarkable , and evidenced by looking at the relaxation frequency change.@xcite the @xmath1-dependence of the dielectric anomaly can be _ quantitatively _ explained as due to the charge oscillations induced by the peierls soft mode,@xcite and evidence of the soft mode has been achieved by looking at the ir side - bands@xcite formerly considered as experimental proofs of lrct.@xcite finally , if the conductivity increase in the @xmath2-induced nit is due to current carrying lrct,@xcite their presence and role is only marginal in driving the @xmath1-induced nit , as the conductivity shows an increase only within a few degrees before @xmath3.@xcite recent model calculations have indeed shown that lrct are thermally accessible at ambient temperature , whereas their concentration is very small at @xmath3.@xcite metastable domains are then important in ttf - ca @xmath2-induced nit , but not in the @xmath1-induced one .    according to the above description , lrct",
    "characterize the precursor regime of ttf - ca @xmath2-induced nit .",
    "however , they do not anticipate and build the ionic , ferroelectric phase , but a double ionicity phase , @xmath37 , whose nature we shall now address .",
    "first of all , it is not the paralectric phase described in ref .",
    ", since domains of different ionicity have comparable concentrations , and well defined ionicity ( figs .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] and  [ f : fig2]a ) .",

    "n _ and _ i _ stacks has been proposed several times , both from the standpoint of theory,@xcite and of experiment.@xcite however , our data strongly suggest that the two species with different ionicity are both on the ionic side , @xmath36 and @xmath19 .",
    "we have several hints in this direction .",
    "we remind only that at 1.0 gpa the intensity of the vibronic bands saturates ( inset of fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] ) , indicating completely dimerized stacks , with ionicity values well above the conventional @xmath4 = 0.5 borderline.@xcite thus the intermediate phase is likely a _ statically disordered _ mixed phase , defined by randomly oriented _",
    "polar _ domains of different ionicity , which gradually polarize evolving towards the ordered ferroelectric phase above 1.24 gpa .",
    "the characterization of the precursor regime and the found coexistence of two different _ ionic _ domains in the intermediate phase are the most novel results of this work . from this perspective",
    ", we may also envision a mechanism of ttf - ca @xmath2-induced nit involving a competition between nucleation and a sort of solid state spinodal decomposition.@xcite in this picture the precursor regime is the nucleation regime , characterized by large amplitude local fluctuations ( droplets ) . rather than evolving in the new stable phase when the droplets size reaches a critical value , we may have the insurgence of small amplitude large scale fluctuations of the order parameter , so that the system is globally unstable , and immediately develops the mixed @xmath37 phase , with strongly intermixed mesoscopic domains .",
    "further application of pressure converts this phase into the ferroelectric phase with a single ionicity .",

    "<S> we report a detailed spectroscopic study of the pressure induced neutral - ionic phase transition ( nit ) of the mixed - stack charge - transfer ( ct ) crystal tetrathiafulvalene - chloranil ( ttf - ca ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the pressure induced phase transition is still first - order and involves the presence of an intermediate _ disordered _ phase , defined by the coexistence of two species of different ionicity . </S>",
    "<S> further application of pressure gradually converts this phase into an homogeneous ferroelectric phase with a single ionicity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we detect strong pretransitional phenomena which anticipate the intermediate phase and are indicative of a precursor dynamic regime dominated by fluctuations . </S>"
