    "electron whistler interactions have long been considered as a mechanism for pitch angle scattering .",
    "gyroresonance processes with near - parallel propagating waves ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) have been shown to produce pitch angle diffusion for electrons that are at resonance with a series of whistler waves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize resonant diffusion to include all phase space dynamics , i.e. as well as considering the resonant diffusion of trapped electrons we consider diffusion of untrapped electrons ( we refer to this process as ` off - resonance ' diffusion ) .",
    "therefore we maximize the area in phase space contributing to pitch angle diffusion .",
    "the underlying dynamics of the interaction between electrons and a single whistler are inherently simple , as demonstrated by @xcite who derived the hamiltonian for relativistic electrons interacting with a whistler with a single wave number . however , for a single monochromatic whistler the process is not stochastic .",
    "we introduce stochasticity by including an identical , oppositely directed whistler mode wave .",
    "we initially consider a simplified system consisting of monochromatic whistlers in order to understand the underlying behaviour .",
    "this treatment is then extended to consider whistler wave packets , i.e. a group of waves with a range of frequencies .",
    "we derive approximate equations in the limit of low whistler wave amplitudes and consider the degree of pitch angle diffusion for waves of different frequencies and bandwidths and for electrons of different energies .",
    "we derive full relativistic equations of motion and approximate them in the limit of low wave amplitudes , for the case of monochromatic whistlers and wave packets . we normalize time to the electron gyrofrequency @xmath0 , ( where @xmath1 is the background magnetic field )",
    ", the wave amplitude is normalized to the background magnetic field , wave frequency is normalized to the gyrofrequency and we normalize the electron velocity to the phase velocity of the waves , given by the electron dispersion relation ( ignoring ion effects ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the plasma oscillation frequency .",
    "electrons can become trapped by either of the two whistlers if they are traveling close to the resonance velocity , given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an integer and @xmath6 is the relativistic factor .          in the limit of low wave",
    "amplitudes the full equations of motion can be reduced to : @xmath7   \\cos\\left[kx\\right]\\label{eq : red}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the distance along the background magnetic field , @xmath9 is the normalized wave amplitude , @xmath10 is the initial perpendicular velocity and @xmath11 .      instead of a pair of waves",
    "it is more realistic to consider the interaction of a wave packet , ie a small group of waves with a range of wave frequencies and wave numbers .",
    "we assume the wave amplitude is non - zero over wave frequency range @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the central wave frequency of the wave packet .",
    "integrating the monochromatic ehistler equation  ( [ eq : red ] ) over the frequency range @xmath12 gives the following wave packet equation :    @xmath15\\!\\ !",
    "\\frac{\\sin\\!\\left[\\!(t\\!-\\!\\beta x)\\!\\delta\\omega\\!/\\!2\\right ] } { ( t-\\beta x ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\omega_e \\!\\!\\frac{2bv_{\\perp 0}}{\\gamma_0}\\!\\ ! \\sin\\!\\!\\left[\\!(\\!\\frac{1}{\\gamma_0}\\!-\\!\\omega)t \\!-\\ !",

    "the wave packet equation  ( [ eq : packet ] ) yields the monochromatic whistler equation  ( [ eq : red ] ) in the limit @xmath17 , with amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "the monochromatic and wave packet equations were solved numerically using a variable order , variable stepsize differential equation integrator .",
    "we consider physical parameters for the terrestrial magnetosphere at @xmath19 : gyrofrequency , @xmath20 , plasma frequency , @xmath21 , background magnetic field , @xmath22 and wave amplitude @xmath23 , giving a normalized wave amplitude , consistent with quiet times in the terrestrial magnetosphere , @xmath24 ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the phase plots in figure  [ fig : mono ] are comprised of stroboscopic surfaces of section @xcite to sample the full electron phase space .",
    "the initial parallel velocity was varied over the range @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the resonance velocity , given by the resonance condition , ( [ eq : res ] ) , for @xmath27 .",
    "all electrons were given a constant initial perpendicular velocity , with @xmath28 as it was found that a high velocity anisotropy was required for stochasticity .",
    "in figure  [ fig : mono ] we plot parallel velocity @xmath29 against phase angle @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the angle between whistler propagating in a positive direction along the background field and the perpendicular velocity , @xmath31 . in panel",
    "a ) we consider a whistler wave amplitude consistent with quiet times @xmath32 all trajectoriesin phase space are regular .",
    "there is little change in @xmath33 and hence only weak pitch angle diffusion .",
    "as the wave amplitude is increased , stochastic trajectories are introduced , as the regular trajectories between the two resonances are progressively broken down . in panel",
    "b ) we consider the case of intense whistler wave activity during substorms ( @xmath34 , see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the stochastic region grows to encompass the resonances as the wave amplitude is increased .",
    "regular trajectories are confined to kam surfaces ( near - integrable trajectories with an approximate constant of the motion @xcite ) .",
    "the stochastic region is bounded by the first untrapped ( regular ) trajectories away from the resonances , thus there is a limit on diffusion in phase space .    as well as resonant diffusion of trapped electrons",
    ", there is diffusion of untrapped electrons throughout the stochastic region of phase space .",
    "since , for sufficient wave amplitudes , the stochastic region can encompass the resonances , the diffusion of untrapped electrons , which we refer to as ` off - resonance ' diffusion , may be enhanced over resonant diffusion .",
    "in addition we achieve pitch angle diffusion from a larger area of phase space .     change in pitch angle from an initial pitch angle of @xmath35 , for quiet time wave amplitudes ( @xmath24 ) and narrow and wide whistler wave packets . for narrow wave packets",
    "there is little change in pitch angle . for wide wave packets",
    "there is a large change in pitch angle ( @xmath36 ) occuring within a few tens of electron gyroperiods ( @xmath37 ) , hence the interaction is rapid .",
    "changes in pitch angle attenuate with time and the pitch angle reaches a constant value . ]    due to the time dependent nature of the wave packet equation  ( [ eq : packet ] ) it is not possible to construct phase diagrams as in figure  [ fig : mono ] for the monochromatic whistler case .",
    "instead we can consider the dynamics of single electrons . in figure",
    "[ fig : nw ] we show a single trajectory solution of the wave packet equation  ( [ eq : packet ] ) , for quiet time wave amplitudes and wide ( @xmath38 ) and narrow ( @xmath39 ) whistler wave packets ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the change in pitch angle from an initial pitch angle of @xmath35 . for narrow wave packets",
    "there is little change in pitch angle and the trajectory is regular . for wide wave packets the trajectory is stochastic with a large change in pitch angle ( @xmath36 ) occuring within a few tens of electron gyroperiods ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we can now achieve strong pitch angle diffusion for wave amplitudes consistent with the quiet time magnetosphere .",
    "log change in pitch angle , @xmath40 , as a function of wave frequency , @xmath41 , and initial pitch angle , @xmath42 , for 10  kev electrons ( @xmath43 ) and quiet time ( low amplitude),wide band whistler wave packets ( @xmath44 ) . for",
    "high to moderate initial pitch angles ( @xmath45 ) there is a change in pitch angle of up to @xmath46 . for low pitch angles ( @xmath47 )",
    "the change in pitch angle is of the order of a few degrees . ]",
    "using the wave packet equation  ( [ eq : packet ] ) with quiet time whistlers ( @xmath24 ) and a relatively wide band whistler ( @xmath38 , @xcite ) , we can estimate the degree of pitch angle scattering . in figures",
    "[ fig:10 ] and [ fig:100 ] we estimate the log change in pitch angle , @xmath40 , as a function of wave frequency , @xmath41 , and initial pitch angle , @xmath42 .",
    "we consider the interaction between @xmath48 electrons in figure  [ fig:10 ] ( @xmath49 electrons in figure  [ fig:100 ] ) and wide band whistlers ( @xmath50 ) . for high to moderate initial pitch angles ( @xmath45 )",
    "there is a change in pitch angle of up to @xmath46 . for low pitch angles ( @xmath47 )",
    "the change in pitch angle is of the order of a few degrees . in figure  [ fig:100 ]",
    "we see a similar degree of diffusion except that lower frequency whistler wave packets are required .     as for figure [ fig:10 ] except for 100  kev electrons ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "pitch angle scattering from a few degrees up to @xmath46 occurs although lower frequency whistler wave packets are required . ]",
    "we have considered electron - whistler wave particle interactions to investigate diffusion over all phase space , to include both resonant and ` off - resonance ' diffusion .",
    "we have considered a simplified interaction with monochromatic whistler wave to understand the underlying behaviour and have shown that the presence of the second whistler wave introduces stochastic effects into the system . for wave amplitudes",
    "consistent with disturbed times we have shown that ` off - resonance ' diffusion occurs and that resonant diffusion is unchanged .    we have considered a more realistic case of whistler wave packets and have shown that for relatively wide band whistler wave packets strong pitch angle diffusion occurs for wave amplitudes consistent with quiet , undisturbed , times .",
    "for high initial pitch angles we estimate a change in pitch angle of up to @xmath46 , while for low pitch angles a change of a few degrees is estimated .",
    "the effectiveness in scattering electrons of different energies is dependent on the wave frequency .",
    "electrons with low energies ( @xmath52 ) are readily scattered by waves of around half the electron gyrofrequency , while electrons at higher energies ( @xmath53 ) are scattered by lower frequency wave ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "@xmath55 electrons would require extremely low frequency waves for efficient scattering , hence our mechanism is most efficient for electrons in the @xmath56 range .",
