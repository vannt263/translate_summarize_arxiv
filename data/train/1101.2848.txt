    "a major problem in the field of ocean dynamics involves forecasting , or predicting , a variety of physical quantities , including temperature , salinity and density . by fusing recently measured data with detailed flow models ,",
    "it is possible to achieve improved prediction .",
    "therefore , forecasts occur with increased accuracy  @xcite . as a result , ocean surveillance may be improved by incorporating the continuous monitoring of a region of interest .",
    "researchers have used surface drifters and submerged floats to acquire data for many years .",
    "more recently , sensing platforms such as autonomous underwater gliders  @xcite have been developed .",
    "the gliders can operate in both littoral ( coastal ) and deep - ocean regimes , and may be used for data acquisition , surveillance and reconnaissance .",
    "one drawback in the use of gliders involves their limited amount of total control actuation due to energy constraints , such as short battery life . for applications such as regional surveillance , energy constraints",
    "may be alleviated by taking advantage of the dynamical flow field structures and their respective body forces .",
    "autonomous underwater gliders are subjected to drift due to hydrodynamic forces .",
    "this drift can be extremely complicated since the velocity fields found in the ocean are aperiodic in time and feature a complex spatial structure . instead of constantly reacting to the drift ( and thereby expending energy )",
    ", one can minimize the glider s energy expenditure by taking advantage of the underlying structure found in geophysical flows .",
    "however , in order to harness the ocean forces to minimize energy expenditure during control actuation , one needs to analyze the structures from the correct dynamical viewpoint .",
    "the potential for dynamical systems tools to shed light on complex , even turbulent , flow fields such as ocean dynamics , has been understood for decades .",
    "work in this area has intensified in the past decade with new focus placed on the improved lagrangian perspective that dynamical systems approaches may provide , especially for complex , aperiodic flows in which the traditional eulerian perspective on the flow is unhelpful or even misleading . during boundary layer separation , for example ,",
    "sheet - like flow structures coincide with fluid particles being ejected from the wall region , a technologically important feature that an eulerian framework fails to capture in unsteady cases , but which has a clear lagrangian signature that can be identified using finite - time lyapunov exponents  @xcite . in liquid jet breakup ,",
    "a similar ejection process occurs during primary atomization , but a limited lagrangian perspective is provided by the liquid - gas interface , revealing liquid sheets and ligaments that precede droplet formation  @xcite .",
    "the development of these critical fluid sheets and ligaments can be traced to unsteady , finite - amplitude global flow structures  @xcite .",
    "dynamical systems tools thus provide a new approach to the characterization and control of these important flows .",
    "geophysical flows offer another example where an eulerian framework is ineffective in the diagnosis of large lagrangian structures and the measurement of transport . for prediction and control of particle dynamics in large surveillance regions of interest ,",
    "lagrangian structures of geophysical flows need to be characterized in both deterministic and stochastic settings .",
    "the field of geophysical fluid dynamics ( gfd ) involves the study of large - scale fluid flows that occur naturally .",
    "gfd flows are , by nature , aperiodic and stochastic .",
    "the data sets describing them are usually finite - time and of low resolution .",
    "established tools of dynamical systems have proven to be less effective in these cases : while providing some insight , they can not provide realistic or detailed flow field data relevant to the trajectories of tracer particles . for this , dynamical systems tools can be applied to fluid flows in an alternative way , by interpreting the eulerian flow field @xmath0 as a dynamical system @xmath1 describing the trajectories of tracer particles .",
    "the phase space and real space are identical here and due to the incompressibility condition @xmath2 , the resulting dynamical system is conservative .",
    "this `` chaotic advection '' approach originated with aref  @xcite and demonstrated that even simple laminar two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic and three - dimensional ( 3d ) steady flows  @xcite could lead to complex , chaotic particle trajectories .",
    "figure  [ fig : ocean ] illustrates an example of how particles in a periodic flow may exhibit unexpected trajectories . in this figure , a single - layer quasi - geostrophic beta plane is being driven by a bimodal wind - stress with a small amplitude periodic perturbation .",
    "details of this ocean model can be found in appendix  [ sec : ocean_model ] .    in the last two decades , this approach has led to new tools including the study of transport by coherent structures  @xcite , lobe dynamics  @xcite , distinguished trajectories  @xcite , and global bifurcations  @xcite .",
    "even though the transport controlling structures in gfd flows are inherently complicated and unsteady , their understanding is necessary to the design of glider controls . to overcome this obstacle",
    "we combine a set of dynamical systems tools that have proven effective in higher dimensions  @xcite and stochastic problems  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider a well - known driven double - gyre flow as an example to illustrate our prediction / control framework  @xcite .",

    "they also pinpoint regions of local sensitivity in the phase space of interest . since basin boundaries are most sensitive to initial conditions , uncertainties in the data near the boundaries generate obstructions to predictability .",
    "therefore , highly uncertain regions in phase space may be revealed by computing local probability densities of uncertain regions in the deterministic case , but using noisy initial data .",
    "finally , in the time - dependent stochastic case , we can describe which sets contain very long term , albeit finite , trajectories .",
    "the sets are almost invariant due to the stochastic forcing on the system , which causes random switching between the almost invariant sets .",
    "the tools we use here are based on the stochastic frobenius - perron operator theory .",
