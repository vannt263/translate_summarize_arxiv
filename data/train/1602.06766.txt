    "in this supplementary materials we show how to derive the dynamic equations for energy and momentum of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) texture starting from the ideas of refs .  .",
    "we consider a collinear af whose state is described by the nel vector @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the orientation of the nel vector can vary in space and time , hence we treat @xmath91 as a field variable . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that an af sample is rather large and disregard boundary conditions .",
    "the derivation is based on three ideas .",
    "first , an af possess a nonzero magnetization which originates from the external magnetic field , @xmath23 , and from the dynamics of the nel vector .",
    "if the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the magnetic sublattices ( parametrized with the effective , so called spin - flip , field @xmath27 ) is much stronger than all other fields , magnetization of an af can be explicitly expressed through the nel vector as : @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "correspondingly , the equation of motion for the af vector in the presence of spin pumping and damping can be treated as the balance equation for the magnetization @xmath95:@xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is gilbert damping constant , @xmath98 is a flux of magnetization which can originate e.g. , from spin current transferred to the localized spins .",
    "the effective field @xmath99 is , in thermodynamic sense , conjugate to the nel vector .",
    "it includes contributions from the nel field @xmath100 , zeeman magnetic field @xmath29 , and magnetocrystalline anisotropy with the energy density @xmath101 .",
    "second , if the external fields are relatively small ( i.e. below the limit of the texture stability ) , a texture can move as a whole with only slight variation of its shape . at this level",
    "the texture can be treated as a particle and can be described with such variables as energy , momentum , angular momentum , which in the framework of classical mechanics are related to conserved quantities .",
    "@xcite    third , dynamics of af is invariant with respect to the lorentz transformations , @xcite where the magnon velocity @xmath37 plays the role of limiting velocity of excitations in the media ( equivalent to the speed of light ) .",
    "this can be seen immediately from the dynamic equation ( deduced from ( [ eq_magnetization ] ) and ( [ eq_dynamics_magnetization ] ) ) for the infinite homogeneous af in the absence of the external fields and damping : @xmath102=0.\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq_motion_af_ideal ] ) has at least three integrals of motion ( which coincide with the conservation laws ) : texture energy , @xmath103 , momentum , @xmath104 , and angular momentum .",

    "( [ eq_motion_af_ideal ] ) , @xmath107 can be treated as the components of a 4-vector .    in the presence of zeeman and nel fields the energy - momentum vector , @xmath107 ,",

    "it should be noted that , as the dynamic equations for afs are rather newtonian - like than gyroscopic - like ( like in fm ) , we can treat @xmath109 as a force , not as a torque .",
    "the balance equations for @xmath107 form a set of dynamic equations for an af texture . to deduce these equations",
    "one starts from general equation of motion for the nel vector in the presence of the external fields and damping : @xmath110      = \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}-\\gamma\\alpha_gh_\\mathrm{ex}\\mathbf{l}\\times\\dot{\\mathbf{l}}.\\ ] ] once @xmath91 is the solution of the dynamic eq .",

    "<S> we demonstrate the possibility to drive an antiferromagnet domain - wall at high velocities by field - like nel spin - orbit torques . </S>",
    "<S> such torques arise from current - induced local fields that alternate their orientation on each sub - lattice of the antiferromagnet and whose orientation depend primarily on the current direction , giving them their field - like character . the domain - wall velocities that can be achieved by this mechanism are two orders of magnitude greater than the ones in ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the efficiency of the staggered spin - orbit fields to couple to the order parameter and from the exchange - enhanced phenomena in antiferromagnetic texture dynamics , which leads to a low domain - wall effective mass and the absence of a walker break - down limit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , because of its nature , the staggered spin - orbit field can lift the degeneracy between two 180@xmath0 rotated states in a collinear antiferromagnet and provides a force that can move such walls and control the switching of the states .    </S>",
    "<S> antiferromagnets ( afs ) are promising materials for spintronics because they show fast magnetic dynamics , low susceptibility to magnetic fields , and produce no stray fields . </S>",
    "<S> these advantages stem from the peculiarities of the af ordering , which consists of alternating magnetic moments on individual atomic sites with zero net magnetization , and whose orientation is described by the nel vector . </S>",
    "<S> this also means that an af can not be efficiently manipulated by external magnetic fields ; a fact that has relegated afs as primarily passive elements in todays technology . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics focuses on reversing this trend , making afs active elements in spintronic based devices.@xcite    a new way to actively manipulate the nel order parameter of the af is the recently proposed relativistic nel spin - orbit torque ( nsot).@xcite this nsot is the antiferromagnetic version of the inverse spin - galvanic ( edelstein ) mechanism,@xcite which generates current - induced spin - orbit torques in ferromagnets ( fms).@xcite it produces locally a non - equilibrium spin polarization in particular crystal structures that is proportional to the applied uniform current and alternates in sign between the different magnetic sublattices . </S>",
    "<S> the local non - equilibrium spin polarization results in a staggered spin - orbit field that couples effectively to the nel order parameter , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_1](a).@xcite     ( red and purple ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current - induced staggered nsot field ( @xmath1 - green and blue ) has opposite sign at each mn sublattice . the non - magnetic as atoms ( light grey ) provide the locally broken inversion symmetry at the mn inversion partner sites which gives rise to the local current - induced fields via spin - orbit coupling . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) afdw between 180@xmath0 rotated antiferromagnetic domains in the presence of the staggered nsot field . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density has opposite sign in the left / right domains , producing a ponderomotive force . </S>",
    "<S> ( c - d ) afdw between 90@xmath0 rotated antiferromagnetic domains in ( c ) staggered nsot field and ( d ) uniform zeeman ( @xmath3 ) field . ]    the nsot arises in crystals whose magnetic atoms have local environment with broken inversion symmetry and where the two magnetic sublattices form inversion partners , such as in mn@xmath4au and cumnas . </S>",
    "<S> its first observation has been recently reported in cumnas,@xcite with the measurements indicating that the nsot switching involved a reconfiguration of a multiple - domain state of the af . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates a study of current - induced af dynamics beyond the coherent single - domain regime , in particular a study of the antiferromagnetic domain wall ( afdw ) motion driven by the field - like nsot . </S>",
    "<S> both 90@xmath0 and 180@xmath0 afdws are experimentally relevant since in thicker cumnas films an in - plane biaxial anisotropy dominates,@xcite while thinner films ( below @xmath510  nm ) are uniaxial.@xcite in these crystals the staggered spin - orbit field is generated by an electrical current applied in the ( 001)-plane . </S>",
    "<S> the nsot field is oriented in the plane in the direction perpendicular to the current and its amplitude from ab initio calculations is in the range of @xmath5  1 - 10  mt per 10@xmath6  a/@xmath7 .    ) that cants @xmath8 forward and the much larger internal torque from the exchange interaction ( @xmath9 ) rotates the sub - lattice magnetisations towards their respective easy axis directions which causes the afdw motion . </S>",
    "<S> the large ratio between exchange torque and external torque leads a to a very small deformation of the dw from its equilibrium ( bloch ) configuration , i.e. , to a very small afdw mass . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) in a fm the external driving field torque can reach similar magnitude as the internal anisotropy torque ( @xmath10 ) , which leads to larger deformation of the fmdw from its equilibrium ( bloch ) configuration , i.e. , to a much larger fmdw mass . ]    </S>",
    "<S> -0.5 cm    in this letter we present a theoretical study demonstrating that afdws can be controlled electrically by the field - like nsots with high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the staggered nsot field opens an unprecedented possibility to set into motion a 180@xmath11 afdw in a collinear af . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , whereas the velocity of a ferromagnetic domain wall ( fmdw ) is limited by the walker - breakdown , in an af only the much higher magnon velocity sets the upper limit.@xcite in a fm the walker - breakdown arises when the fmdw begins to oscillate between a bloch and nel type driven by a competition of the external field torque and the internal anisotropy torque , which can be of similar order , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_2 ] ( a ) and ( c ) . in an af on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the internal torque driven by exchange is several orders of magnitude larger than any driving torque , which leads to a stiff afdw , a very low effective mass of the afdw , and no walker - breakdown point , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . at fields below the walker - breakdown both the fm and af </S>",
    "<S> have similar dependence on the driving field . in our calculations ( assuming no extrinsic pinning ) we show that the velocities are proportional to the nel field and estimate that they can reach values of @xmath12 km / s , orders of magnitude higher than in fms . </S>",
    "<S> also , by comparing the steady motion of a 90@xmath0 afdw in the presence of a uniform zeeman field and the staggered spin - orbit field , we show that the velocities induced by the latter are much greater ( for equal magnitudes of the two fields ) .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it has been shown that the afdw can be dragged by an stm - tip that generates a spin - polarized current , with the velocity of the afdw equal to the velocity of the tip.@xcite there have also been other mechanisms proposed for the induced motion of the afdw . </S>",
    "<S> it can be pushed by circularly polarized magnons.@xcite in systems formed by antiferromagnetically coupled thin - film fms ( synthetic afs ) , where the antiferromagnetic coupling is not as strong as in our case of bulk af , an antiferromagnetic texture can be moved by the electric current due to dissipative ( antidamping - like ) spin torques.@xcite another proposed method to manipulate an afdw is with the gradient of external magnetic field.@xcite all of these proposed methods for afdw manipulation can not reach the high velocities and efficiencies afforded by the field - like nsots .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a compensated collinear af described by the sublattice magnetization vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , in which the electrical current generates the non - equilibrium staggered spin - orbit field described by vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 acting on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_1 ] ( a ) . for convenience </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath1 in units of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion to current density can be calculated by microscopic techniques as , e.g. , in ref . .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the direct coupling between the atomic spins and the local fields , the current - induced contribution to the magnetic energy density of an af takes a form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the nel order parameter vector , and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the sign and orientation of @xmath21 is dermined by the sign and orientation of the applied electrical current . in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field or in a general case when @xmath22 , there is an additional uniform zeeman field contribution , @xmath23 , which in the magnetic energy density expression couples to the uncompensated magnetization of the af , @xmath24 . the externally applied zeeman and nel fields act on an af in different ways . </S>",
    "<S> the nel field can change only the equilibrium orientation of the af vector @xmath25 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman field produces a small magnetization @xmath26 , where @xmath27 stands for exchange field that keeps magnetic sublattices antiparallel . the final expression for the magnetic energy density </S>",
    "<S> can then be written as : @xmath28 it follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_field_energy ] ) that the effect produced in afs by the zeeman field is i ) quadratic in @xmath29 and ii ) weakened due to the strong exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the effect of the nel field is linear in @xmath21 and not diminished by the strong exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> hence its effect will be much stronger than the effect of the zeeman field . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to note that the nel field can remove the degeneracy of states with opposite direction of @xmath25 , while other physical fields can distinguish only between states with different orientation of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this directly implies that the nel field can produce an effective force per area  @xmath30 that will set into motion the afdw between 180@xmath0 rotated domains that is independent of the microscopic structure of the afdw . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of @xmath21 ( of the applied electrical current ) determines the direction of the afdw motion .    to study this problem in more detail we consider an example of a one - dimensional texture in a uniaxial af and in the presence of a dc nel field parallel to the af easy axis ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_1 ] ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> such af has two states that are magnetically equivalent at zero fields with @xmath31 parallel to the easy axis . </S>",
    "<S> both states have the same zeeman energy , since @xmath32 , and therefore the zeeman field can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of an af texture is described by phenomenological equations for the af vector ( see , e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> baryakhtar1979 , andreev1980 , baryakhtar1980 ) . in our case </S>",
    "<S> these equations are reduced to the following equation for the angle @xmath33 between @xmath25 and the easy axis : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath36 is the magnetic anisotropy field , @xmath37 is the magnon velocity , and @xmath38 is the gilbert damping parameter .    equation ( [ eq_equation_theta_neel_field ] ) has a solution which describes a moving afdw separating domains with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of steady motion , @xmath41 is obtained from the balance between the force produced by the nel field and the internal ( gilbert ) damping . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the ferromagnetic case , the velocity is only limited by the magnon velocity @xmath42 ( as mentioned in refs . ) , where @xmath43 is the exchange stiffness .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare this result with the steady motion of the fmdw , separating 180@xmath0 rotated domains in a uniaxial fm , induced by a zeeman magnetic field or , equivalently , by the field - like component of a current - induced spin torque ( see e.g. ref .   for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a fmdw can not move while keeping its form , even in the presence of a zeeman field parallel to the easy axis , since a parallel shift is connected with a variation of the total magnetization.@xcite in contrast , the magnetization of an af in the presence of the nel field has a pure dynamic origin . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the parallel shift of an afdw does not affect the total magnetization of the texture .    </S>",
    "<S> steady motion of the fmdw in a uniaxial fm is often combined with the rotation of the magnetization around the easy axis with a constant angular velocity @xmath44 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the steady motion is proportional to the damping coefficient : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the wall width . in the more realistic case considered by </S>",
    "<S> walker,@xcite the magnetic anisotropy function includes demagnetization energy . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> magnetization in the moving fmdw makes a constant angle @xmath47 with the fmdw plane , where the critical field @xmath48 sets the walker limit for the fmdw velocity ( we assume that the dipolar anisotropy field @xmath49 is comparable to the anisotropy fields ) : @xmath50 the mobilities of afdws and of fmdws below the walker limit could be of the same order for systems with similar values of the wall width and gilbert damping . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen by comparing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_velocity_uniaxial_afm_1 ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( eq_velocity_fm_biaxial ) : @xmath51 however , the limiting velocity of the afdw coincides with the magnon velocity , @xmath52 , which due to strong exchange enhancement , is much larger than the typical magnon velocity in a fm . on the other hand , in a fm the limiting ( walker ) velocity , @xmath53 , where we have assumed @xmath49 is of the order of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath55 is much smaller than @xmath56 . for example </S>",

    "<S> the motion can be described with a reduced number of dynamical variables . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural way to introduce these variables is through the integral of motion for the moving afdw in the absence of external forces ( i.e. , in a homogeneous isotropic space ) . </S>",

    "<S> while both the mass and relaxation time are strongly suppressed in the af due to exchange , the ratio @xmath67 is independent of @xmath68 and is the same as in the fmdw ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",

    "<S> we can understand eq .  </S>",

    "<S> because a shift of the domain wall needs some energy for the reorientation of magnetic moments , its inertia is proportional to the wall width . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the relativistic character of the af dynamics , the width of the moving afdw depends upon its velocity ( it shrinks proportional to a factor @xmath69 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) the pulse duration @xmath81  ns is larger than @xmath84 . ]    the three orders of magnitude difference in the effective force occurs due to the exchange reduction of the zeeman - field effects in an af . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the zeeman field to the domain wall velocity ( magenta line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_3 ] ) is vanishingly small compared to the contribution of the nel field ( green - blue line ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that experimentally the effectiveness of the nel field compared to the zeeman field has been observed for current - induced reconfiguration of 90@xmath85 rotated domains in af cumnas.@xcite . according to microscopic calculations of the current induced nel field in cumnas,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the af states were switched by a current which corresponds to @xmath861 mt , while the zeeman field up to 12 t was not sufficient for such switching .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the maximum domain wall velocity observed up to now in the synthetic afs was at current densities @xmath87a/@xmath7.@xcite according to our calculations , the same afdw velocity in bulk af mn@xmath4au corresponds to a staggered spin - orbit field of 0.07  mt which , according to ref .  , corresponds to a current density of 3.5@xmath88 a/@xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> another experimentally relevant calculation that highlights the efficiency of the nsot field is the domain wall displacement driven by short pulses . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig_4 ] , where a single rectangular pulse is delivered with a field magnitude corresponding to a stead - state domain wall velocity of 250 m / s ( the maximum fmdw velocity reached in experiment@xcite ) . for the afdw we consider the nel field , for the fmdw the zeeman field and the relaxation times for the af and fm are @xmath89  ps and @xmath80  ns , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although the ultimate displacement of both the fmdw and the afdw is the same , the afdw attains it much faster due to its low mass and the resulting weak afdw inertia . </S>",
    "<S> the favorable characteristics of the afdw dynamics compared to the fmdw is more pronounced at short pulses ( @xmath90 ) , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_4 ] .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the efficiency of the afdw motion by the nsot field . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting velocity of the afdw motion induced by the nel field is several orders of magnitude higher than the limiting velocity of a fmdw and can be achieved at attainable currents densities . </S>",
    "<S> the nsot induces a force on a 90@xmath0 afdw which is orders of magnitude higher compared to a zeeman field and thus provides an effective control of the af state . for a 180@xmath0 rotated af domains , only the staggered nsot field can drive the afdw .    </S>",
