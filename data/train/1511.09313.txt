    "recent startling results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) show that key signatures of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation are found in high - multiplicity p+p and p / d+a collision systems . in particular , collective behavior @xcite , strangeness enhancement @xcite , and quarkonium suppression @xcite",
    "appear to be sensitive only to the measured multiplicity of the collision , and not to the size of the nuclear fireball as navely implied by the type of the colliding particles .",
    "jet quenching is another key observable of qgp formation @xcite , providing a unique femtoscope for probing the precise dynamics of the relevant degrees of freedom in this novel phase of nuclear matter .",
    "energy loss models @xcite based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) have had enormous qualitative success in describing the momentum dependence and angular distribution of the suppression of high - momentum , @xmath2 gev single particle pions @xcite and charged hadrons @xcite from primordial hard light flavors and gluons and electrons @xcite as well as @xmath3 @xcite and non - prompt @xmath4 mesons @xcite from open heavy flavor decays at mid rapidity in a+a systems from @xmath5 0.2 atev to 2.76 atev .",
    "early experimental analysis shows a tantalizing correlation between centrality and suppression of jets in p / d+a collisions at rhic and lhc @xcite . these early results and sure - to - come future measurements call for quantitative theoretical predictions for jet tomography in small colliding systems .",
    "there are two major complications to comparing theoretical predictions to experimental measurements in small colliding systems .",
    "first , phenomenologically , there is an inherent bias between rare high - multiplicity events and the rare collisions initially populated with one or more high transverse momentum ( high-@xmath6 ) particles @xcite .",
    "second , theoretically , derivations of energy loss based on pqcd use simplifying assumptions @xcite that make them inapplicable to small systems .",
    "the first complication makes it difficult to properly normalize the usual observable used in tomographic studies , the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 is the ratio of a spectrum in a+b collisions to the same particle spectrum in p+p collisions suitably normalized such that @xmath8 for particles unaffected by the presence of a qgp . because of the aforementioned bias , properly normalizing @xmath7 in high - multiplicity p+p and p / d+a events is problematic .",
    "one solution may be to divide the spectrum of interest by a known unaffected electroweak spectrum with the same event selection criteria , forming a @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 .",
    "the work of this letter was motivated by the second complication . in the usual dglv opacity expansion @xcite",
    ", the energy loss derivation assumes a large separation distance @xmath12 between the initial production position @xmath13 of the hard parent parton and the position @xmath14 where it scatters off a qgp medium quasiparticle .",
    "the mean free path of the high-@xmath6 particle is @xmath15 fm while the debye mass in an infinite , static thermal qgp of temperature @xmath16 mev is @xmath17 gev , as derived from thermal field theory @xcite . in the collision of p+p or p / d+a ,",
    "one expects a system of radius @xmath18 fm ; for these collision systems then , most high-@xmath6 particles can not have a large separation distance between production and scattering .    in this letter",
    "we derive the @xmath19 in opacity generalization of dglv for _ all _ separation distances @xmath20 in order to apply this radiative energy loss formalism to small systems .",
    "we find two major unexpected results from our derivation : first , under the usual assumptions of eikonality , collinearity , and large gluon formation time common to all pqcd - based energy loss formalisms @xcite , the all - distance dglv generalization is formally identical to the large separation distance dglv expression ; second , a numerical evaluation of the correction term , which is formally zero under the aforementioned assumptions , is actually dominant compared to the large separation distance dglv expression at high ( @xmath21 gev ) parton energies",
    ".    we will show that the first curiosity is due to a highly non - trivial interference in the squared matrix element between non - zero small separation distance contributions to the first and second order dyson terms in the @xmath19 in opacity amplitude .",
    "we will also show that the second surprise is due to the breakdown of the large formation time approximation in the dglv formalism .",
    "we emphasize that while previous work has demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of _ all _ energy loss calculations to the collinear approximation @xcite , and therefore the need to move beyond its use in all energy loss models , the sensitivity we find from the large formation time approximation is both new and different from the sensitivity to the collinear approximation .",
    "as such all current jet quenching models that include radiative energy loss based on pqcd must individually assess their sensitivity to the large formation time approximation when making quantitative comparisons with data .",
    "in this paper we use precisely the setup of the dglv calulation @xcite , but the details of the current calculation can be found in @xcite . for clarity , we treat the high-@xmath6 eikonal parton produced at an initial point @xmath22 inside a finite qgp , where we have used * p * to mean transverse 2d vectors , @xmath23 for 3d vectors and @xmath24 $ ] for four vectors in minkowski and light cone coordinates respectively . as in the dglv calculation , we consider the target to be a gyulassy - wang debye screened potential @xcite with fourier and color structure given by @xmath25 the color exchanges are handled using the applicable @xmath26 generator @xmath27 in the @xmath28 dimensional representation of the target or @xmath29 in the @xmath30 dimensional representation of the high-@xmath6 parent parton .    in light cone coordinates the momenta of the emitted gluon , the final high-@xmath6 parton , and the exchanged medium debye quasiparticle are @xmath31,\\nonumber\\\\ p    & = \\bigg[(1-x)p^+,\\frac{m^2+\\textbf{k}^2}{(1-x)p^+},-\\textbf{k}\\bigg],\\nonumber\\\\ q    & = [ q^+,q^-,\\textbf{q}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the initially produced high-@xmath6 particle of mass @xmath32 has large momentum @xmath33 and negligible other momentum components . notice that we include the ter - mikayelian plasmon effect with an effective emitted gluon mass @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] for a visualization of these momenta .    a shorthand for energy ratios will prove useful notationally .",
    "following @xcite we define @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "we will also make the following crucial assumptions : 1 ) the eikonal , or high energy , approximation , for which @xmath40 is the largest energy scale of the problem ; 2 ) the soft ( radiation ) approximation @xmath41 ; 3 ) collinearity , @xmath42 ; 4 ) that the impact parameter varies over a large transverse area ; and , most crucially for this letter , 5 ) the large formation time assumption @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "note that the above approximations , in addition to allowing us to systematically drop terms that are small , permit us to 1 ) ( eikonal ) ignore the spin of the high-@xmath6 parton ; 2 ) ( soft ) assume the source current for the parent parton varies slowly with momentum @xmath45 ; 3 ) ( collinearity ) complete a separation of energy scales @xmath46 and 4 ) take the ensemble average over the phase factors , which become @xmath47    in the original dglv calculations @xcite , the large formation time played only a minor role .",
    "however , when considering short separation distances between the scattering centers , the large formation time assumption naturally increases in importance .    with the above approximations , we reevaluated the 10 diagrams contributing to the @xmath19 in opacity energy loss amplitude @xcite without the additional simplification of the large separation distance @xmath48 assumption .    0.7    0.7",
    "in the original evaluation of the 10 diagrams contributing to the @xmath19 in opacity energy loss derivation , the large separation distance approximation @xmath49 allowed the neglect of terms proportional to @xmath50 . in our reevaluation of these 10 diagrams we retained all terms proportional to @xmath50 . however , we found an enormous simplification due to the large radiated gluon formation time approximation @xmath51 : all but 2 of the 10 diagrams 18 new small distance correction pole contributions are suppressed under the large formation time assumption .",
    "we show the two diagrams with non - zero contributions at the amplitude level @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the large formation time approximation in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",

    "[ eq : elossfull ] has the properties we expect : 1 ) the correction goes to zero as the separation distance becomes large , @xmath58 ( or , equivalently , as the debye screening length goes to 0 , @xmath59 ) and 2 ) the correction term vanishes as the separation distance vanishes , @xmath60 , due to the destructive interference of the lpm effect .",
    "an immediate puzzle is the breaking of color triviality seen to all orders in opacity in the large separation distance approximation @xcite ; in the small separation distance correction , the color triviality breaking comes from the term proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "unexpectedly , euler s formula for the exponential representation of the trigonometric functions reveals that the arguments of the cosines in eq [ eq : elossfull ] are approximately zero in the large formation time limit ( compared to the @xmath62 ) .",

    "one sees that the small separation distance correction has a non - negligible effect even for large path lengths .",

    "the fact that the short separation distance `` correction '' term can dominate over the leading large separation distance dglv result even out to path lengths @xmath102 when relaxing the large formation time assumption ( effects that should tend to zero under the large formation time assumption ) , suggests that the large formation time assumption is invalid in the dglv approach .    before further investigating the large formation time assumption ,",

    ". the lower limit of @xmath108 comes from considering the typical momentum fraction taken from the parent parton by the emitted gluon , @xmath109 @xcite ; the upper limit of @xmath110 results from using @xmath91 .",

    "it is important to note that the large formation time is a separate approximation from the collinear approximation ; it is only when @xmath113 that the two approximations are equivalent .",
    "since all energy loss formalisms , glv , bdmps - z - asw , amy , and ht ( see @xcite and references therein ) exploit the large formation time approximation , we are faced with a need to reassess the applicability of the large formation time assumption in any description of energy loss . while the influence of the assumption of collinearity was relatively easy to quantify across formalisms by simply varying the maximum allowable perpendicular momentum of the emitted gluon , estimating the importance of the large formation time approximation in the other formalisms may be a challenge .",
    "similarly , deriving expressions in the other formalisms that do not rely on either the collinear or large formation time approximations might also be formidable .",
    "the lack of theoretical control over these assumptions calls into doubt the quantitative extraction of medium parameters through the use of jet quenching @xcite .",

    "<S> we use perturbative quantum chromodynamics to compute the corrections to the energy loss of a hard particle due to short separation distances between the creation of the particle and the in - medium scattering center that stimulates bremsstrahlung radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the result has several surprising features . </S>",
    "<S> the correction 1 ) does not go to zero for large path lengths ; 2 ) breaks color triviality ; 3 ) is formally zero in the large formation time approximation , but numerically dominates at large @xmath0 gev parent parton energies out to long @xmath1 fm paths . </S>",
    "<S> although motivated by the recent shocking evidence of collectivity in small systems , 1 ) and 3 ) mean our result has critically important implications for _ all _ energy loss model comparisons to data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , 3 ) shows that a large fraction of the gluons radiated do not have a formation time that is large compared to the debye screening length of the medium , violating a core approximation used in the derivations of all pqcd - based radiative energy loss formulae .    </S>",
