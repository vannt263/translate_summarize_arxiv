    "exploring chiral and deconfining properties of strongly - interacting matter at high temperature is one of the most interesting issues in modern physics ( for reviews , see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the possible existence of a critical endpoint ( cep ) in the qcd phase diagram at non - zero net baryon number density and its consequences for the phase structure of qcd at lower temperatures are much under debate , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "high energy heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic and sps started to look for experimental evidence of the cep and experiments at new heavy - ion facilities ( fair and nica ) , have been designed to probe the relevant high density region in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "gaining insight into properties of qcd at non - zero , even small values of the quark chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) is thus of great interest .",
    "however , in theoretical calculations the relevant region in the qcd phase diagram is not easy to access directly in qcd .",
    "model calculations or non - perturbative lattice qcd calculations , based on approximation schemes , are currently used .    at vanishing chemical potential the lattice qcd calculations",
    "get refined systematically and become possible with almost realistic quark mass values .",
    "they indicate a temperature - driven crossover transition from hadrons to the quark - gluon - plasma phase , for a recent review see  @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case the quantitative determination of the transition temperature is still a difficult task . a careful analysis of cut - off effects is needed to extract this quantity in the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "at non - zero values of the chemical potential the notorious fermion sign problem prohibits straightforward lattice qcd simulations . in order to enter at least the small chemical potential region of the qcd phase diagram several extrapolation methods such as the reweighting technique , analytic continuation to imaginary chemical potential or taylor series expansions",
    "have been proposed .",
    "all these extrapolation methods have their own , intrinsic problems and their reliability is still under investigation , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews . under these circumstances",
    ", it may be useful to apply approximation schemes , used currently in lattice qcd calculations , also in model calculations . through a comparison with analytic results obtainable in qcd - like models",
    ", insight may be gained for the application of approximation schemes in lattice qcd calculations .    in this work we focus on the taylor expansion technique where a thermodynamic quantity such as the pressure is expanded in powers of the chemical potential @xmath1 around vanishing chemical potential , i.e. , around the point at which monte carlo simulations are not hindered by the sign problem .",
    "this method was developed for studies of qcd thermodynamics with the aim to gain information also on the location of a possible critical point in the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "in general , the relevant taylor coefficients can be calculated with standard simulation techniques used also at @xmath2 @xcite . with this approach",
    "the calculation of several thermodynamic quantities has been extended to non - zero values of the chemical potential ; results have been compared with hadron resonance gas model calculations at low temperature  @xcite and quark - gluon gas thermodynamics at high temperature .",
    "attempts have also been made to determine the phase boundary and to infer a possible critical endpoint in the phase diagram from convergence properties of the taylor series for thermodynamic quantities , e.g. , the pressure or quark number susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "so far , basic features of the taylor series such as its convergence properties have received only little attention because a proper investigation of these aspects requires the knowledge of higher - order taylor coefficients . in most qcd studies these coefficients",
    "are difficult to obtain and a systematic analysis of convergence properties is not yet possible . at present",
    "any attempts to identify some precursor effects of a possible critical endpoint thus have to rely on information extracted from a few low order expansion coefficients .",
    "recently , a new algorithmic differentiation technique has been developed that allows for the calculation of higher - order taylor coefficients in functional approaches @xcite .",
    "this enables one to investigate general convergence properties of the taylor expansion method at least in model calculations .",
    "their consequences and prospects for the determination of the phase boundary and a possible critical endpoint are discussed here in the framework of the effective @xmath0 flavor polyakov ",
    "quark - meson ( pqm ) model .",
    "the model is studied in mean - field approximation and the findings from the taylor expansion are compared with the corresponding model mean - field solution at finite density  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : taylor ] the taylor expansion method and its application to the analysis of different approximants for radii of convergence are introduced .",
    "we also discuss the improvement of taylor series expansions by a pad resummation .",
    "basic strategies for the determination of the phase boundary and the location of a critical endpoint in the phase diagram from taylor expansion coefficients are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : locating ] .",
    "[ sec : model ] is devoted to the presentation of the model analysis where higher - order taylor coefficients are used to locate the phase boundary and the critical endpoint at finite chemical potential .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] with a brief summary and discussion of our findings .",
    "the taylor expansion method has been used as an approximation scheme to gain information on qcd thermodynamics at high temperature and for small , non - vanishing values of the chemical potential . here , we start with a description of some generic model - independent properties of the taylor expansion of , e.g. , the qcd partition function ( see also @xcite ) .      at fixed temperature the logarithm of the qcd partition function , _",
    "i.e. _ the pressure @xmath3 , may be expanded in a taylor series in powers of @xmath4 around   @xmath5 the taylor expansion coefficients are determined by derivatives with respect to the chemical potential evaluated at vanishing @xmath1 , @xmath6 due to the cp - symmetry of qcd , the partition function is symmetric in @xmath1 , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 which reflects the invariance of @xmath8 under exchange of particles and anti - particles",
    ". as a consequence , all odd expansion coefficients vanish and the series is even in @xmath4 . in qcd , various quark chemical potentials have to be taken into account in this expansion . however , in order to simplify our discussion in the following , we focus on one uniform quark chemical potential @xmath9 which will not restrict our conclusions .    besides the pressure , any thermodynamic observables like , e.g. , the energy density ( @xmath10 ) , the trace anomaly @xmath11 or the quark number susceptibility @xmath12 can be expanded in a similar series with appropriately modified taylor expansion coefficients @xcite . of course",
    ", all these modified taylor expansion coefficients are related to the initial expansion coefficients of the pressure .",
    "an instructive example is the taylor expansion of the quark number susceptibility , @xmath12 , which is defined as the second derivative of the pressure w.r.t . to @xmath1",
    "@xmath13 this yields the following relation to the corresponding taylor expansion coefficients @xmath14 of the pressure @xmath15 the expansion of other thermodynamic quantities like , for instance , the trace anomaly requires additional derivatives of the taylor coefficients w.r.t . the temperature .    in the following we compare the taylor expansion of the pressure and the quark number susceptibility at non - zero chemical potential .",
    "if a critical endpoint exists in the qcd phase diagram then it is expected that the quark number susceptibility diverges at that point while the pressure stays finite and is still continuous .",
    "although the taylor series for both quantities have identical radii of convergence they thus will behave differently on the phase boundary .",
    "a comparison of both series as the truncation order is increased might therefore be helpful to gain new insights in locating a possible cep in the qcd phase diagram .      whether or not the radius of convergence of the taylor expansion of the thermodynamic potential around @xmath16 is related to a phase transition in the physical system",
    "crucially depends on the location of the singularity in the complex @xmath1-plane that causes the breakdown of the series expansion .",
    "only if this singularity lies on the real axis the radius of convergence corresponds to the location of a critical point .",
    "information on the location of the singularity in the complex @xmath1-plane can be deduced from properties of the taylor expansion coefficients themselves . in any case , the singularity closest to @xmath16 will determine the radius of convergence of the taylor series .",
    "this can be obtained from the behavior of the taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure , @xmath17 other definitions of the radius of convergence are known and their application in the context of qcd have been discussed in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite .    of course , in almost all applications only a finite number of expansion coefficients are known and the limit @xmath18 can not be performed . in some cases it might be possible to extrapolate the @xmath19 to infinity , making use of their expected asymptotic behavior .",
    "otherwise , one will have to assume that the radius of convergence @xmath20 has been reached when subsequent estimators , @xmath19 , do not change within errors anymore .    at a given order @xmath21",
    "the taylor expansions of different observables will give different estimators for the radius of convergence , which are all related .",
    "for example , the estimator for the radius of convergence obtained from the quark number susceptibility , @xmath22 , is related to the one obtained from the pressure series via @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 both estimators for the radius of convergence will converge to the same unique limit @xmath20 since the prefactor in front of @xmath25 tends to one . however , at finite order @xmath21 the estimates for @xmath19 and @xmath22 will differ and as a consequence both may approach the limit @xmath20 at a different rate . for large @xmath21",
    "we find from @xmath26 when deviations from the asymptotic value @xmath20 are of @xmath27 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath28 with a positive , constant @xmath29 , both estimators for the radius of convergence will converge with the same truncation errors of @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "[ sec : crit ] ) .",
    "deviations from the asymptotic value @xmath20 will , however , be numerically smaller in the susceptibility series than in the pressure series by a factor @xmath30 . in other words , the estimator for the radius of convergence obtained from the susceptibility series at given order @xmath21 might be more suitable for estimating the true radius of convergence than the one obtained from other observables , e.g. , from the pressure series .",
    "the convergence of a taylor series can be improved further by a resummation of the expansion coefficients which is based on a pad approximation ( for details see @xcite ) . for clarity and completeness ,",
    "we collect the needed facts here .",
    "the pad resummation employs the same derivative information as the initial taylor expansion coefficients but often shows an extended convergence range , in particular in the presence of singularities .",
    "furthermore , a more stable result can be achieved with fewer coefficients .",
    "the pad approximant can be obtained by rewriting a taylor series of an analytic function @xmath31 around @xmath32 to order @xmath33 @xmath34 as a ratio of two power series @xmath35 and @xmath36 of order @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively @xmath39\\equiv    r_{l , m}(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\\frac{p_0+p_1x+\\cdots+p_lx^l}{1+q_1      x+\\cdots+q_mx^m}\\ .\\ ] ]    one advantage of this reformulation is that poles and singularities are better characterized by a rational function than by a polynomial taylor series .",
    "the expansion coefficients for @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be obtained up to order @xmath42 by equating the derivatives of both series up to order @xmath33 at @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44    an alternative and more elegant form relates the pad approximant to determinants of two @xmath45 matrices as follows @xmath46= \\small \\frac{\\left| \\begin{array}{cccc }    t_{(l - m+1 ) } & t_{(l - m+2 ) } & \\cdots & t_{(l+1)}\\\\    t_{(l - m+2 ) } & t_{(l - m+3 ) } & \\cdots & t_{(l+2)}\\\\    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\    t_{(l ) } & t_{(l+1 ) } & \\cdots & t_{(l+m)}\\\\    \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{l - m } t_{(i ) } x^{m+i } & \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{l - m+1 }    t_{(i)}x^{m+i-1 } & \\cdots & \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{l } t_{(i)}x^{i }   \\end{array } \\right| } { \\left| \\begin{array}{ccccc }    t_{(l - m+1 ) } & t_{(l - m+2 ) } & \\cdots & t_{(l+1)}\\\\    t_{(l - m+2 ) } & t_{(l - m+3 ) } & \\cdots & t_{(l+2)}\\\\    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\    t_{(l ) } & t_{(l+1 ) } & \\cdots &   t_{(l+m)}\\\\    x^{m } & x^{m-1 } & \\cdots & 1 \\end{array } \\right|}\\,.\\ ] ] note that for @xmath47 and @xmath48 the pad approximant is identical to the initial taylor approximation , i.e. , @xmath49 \\equiv t(x)$ ] .",
    "of course , apart from choosing the highest derivative order @xmath33 in the pad approximation one can also vary @xmath37 or @xmath38 independently",
    ".    the determination of the radius of convergence or the phase boundary with the pad approximation is more involved . for the case",
    "@xmath50 $ ] one immediately sees , , that the pad approximant has a pole at @xmath51 since the odd taylor coefficients vanish .",
    "this pole coincides with the estimator for the radius of convergence , @xmath52 , of the taylor series up to order @xmath53 , . for a general pad approximant",
    "@xmath54 $ ] the pole structure is more elaborated . however , in this case the first pole at positive and real chemical potential might provide a useful estimate for the phase boundary .",
    "it has been argued that the estimators for the radius of convergence can be used to determine the location of a possible cep in the qcd phase diagram @xcite . in general , a breakdown of a taylor expansion is caused by a singularity in the complex @xmath1-plane .",
    "only if this singularity , which is closest to the origin at @xmath16 , lies on the real @xmath1-axis , it is also related to a physical phase transition since it is a singularity in a thermodynamic quantity corresponding to a zero in the partition function @xcite .",
    "if a cep exists in the qcd phase diagram , it belongs to the universality class of the three dimensional ising model .",
    "the corresponding second - order phase transition will lead to divergences in thermodynamic observables with a power law behavior .",
    "the finite radius of convergence arises from a singularity on the real @xmath1-axis only if there exists a @xmath55 such that for all @xmath56 all expansion coefficients are positive . since in practice",
    "only a few terms in the taylor series are known such a mathematically rigorous conclusion can not be drawn in general .",
    "the hope is that by investigating the structure of a few known coefficients some hints on the properties of the taylor series and an estimate for the location of a cep in the phase diagram can be obtained . through an inspection of the relative magnitude and relative signs of the expansion coefficients the determination of the radius of convergence of the taylor series might be possible and the singularity in the complex @xmath1-plane which causes the breakdown of this expansion can be located .    since the thermodynamics in the vicinity of a second - order phase transition is dominated by the singular contribution of the free energy density or thermodynamic potential a generic structure of the taylor expansion coefficients should occur @xcite . at vanishing chemical potential the singular behavior near a phase transition",
    "is controlled by the reduced temperature which depends linearly on @xmath57 but quadratically on the chemical potential .",
    "thus , a @xmath58 derivative with respect to @xmath1 shows a singular behavior that is similar to that of the @xmath59 derivative with respect to temperature .",
    "this infers that the structure of the coefficient @xmath60 can be estimated by investigating the temperature derivative of @xmath61 .",
    "this is indeed found in our model calculations .",
    "for an example see fig .",
    "[ fig : coeff ] and the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : ad ] .",
    "this means that @xmath60 will stay positive only up to a temperature which corresponds to the first maximum of the previous coefficient @xmath61 .",
    "near the transition temperature the coefficients start to oscillate .",
    "thus , through a determination of the first maximum in @xmath61 , an estimate for the largest temperature below which all coefficients are positive , becomes feasible . only in this case where all coefficients are positive",
    "the corresponding singularity lies on the real axis .",
    "furthermore , this gives an estimate for the critical temperature where a possible cep in the phase diagram might be located .",
    "once this critical temperature has been obtained the corresponding critical chemical potential follows immediately via @xmath62 .    at higher temperatures the sign of the taylor coefficients",
    "has no generic structure and the singularity that limits the radius of convergence of the taylor series will move in the complex @xmath1-plane . in this case",
    "the convergence radius provides an upper bound since the crossover is related to the real part of the singularity .    for temperatures below the cep and larger chemical potentials",
    "a first - order phase transition emerges . as a consequence , two",
    "degenerate minima of the grand potential exist at criticality .",
    "since the taylor expansion method involves only local information in the vicinity of one minimum of the effective potential , it is , in general , not possible to resolve a first - order phase transition with this technique .",
    "however , it still should be possible to give an upper bound for the location of the phase boundary .",
    "in this section we apply the taylor expansion method to an effective @xmath0 flavor polyakov - quark - meson model .",
    "this model exhibits a critical endpoint in the @xmath63 phase diagram and enables us to inspect the convergence properties of the taylor series for second - order and crossover phase boundaries . for the first time",
    ", the taylor expansion coefficients are calculated to very high orders , so that the convergence of the series can be probed reliably .",
    "furthermore , the results are confronted with a full model solution .",
    "the three flavor polyakov ",
    "quark - meson model  @xcite is a straightforward extension of the two flavor model @xcite and serves as an effective model for strongly - interacting matter which incorporates a chiral phase transition , signaled , for example , by a peak in the chiral susceptibility . through the coupling to the polyakov loop , which is an order parameter for deconfinement in the infinite quark mass limit , it is also sensitive to deconfining aspects of the qcd phase transition .",
    "the thermodynamics of the pqm model is , for vanishing chemical potential evaluated in a mean - field approximation , in good agreement with recent @xmath64 flavor lattice data  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to lattice simulations , the model can be applied directly at finite chemical potential .",

    "finally , the temperature and @xmath1-dependent order parameters are determined by the solution of the gap equations which minimize the grand potential @xmath97 where _ min _ labels the ( @xmath98)-dependent global minimum of the potential .",
    "since the grand potential or the pressure are known , the taylor expansion coefficients in can be obtained by calculating the corresponding derivatives of the grand potential evaluated at the physical potential minimum .",
    "this tedious task is further hindered by the implicit @xmath1-dependence of the order parameters , introduced by .",
    "the explicit @xmath1-dependence is solely given by the fermionic part of the potential @xmath99 whereof the @xmath1-derivatives can , in principle , be obtained analytically .",
    "however , a fully analytical approach is infeasible since the implicit dependences can only be inverted numerically .",
    "standard numerical derivative techniques such as divided differences may be used for this task at least for the first few derivatives , but definitely fail for higher orders due to the increasing rounding and truncation errors .",
    "in order to proceed a novel derivative technique , based on _ algorithmic differentiation _ ( ad ) , was developed that properly allows for the implicit dependencies and further avoids numerical errors .",
    "the ad technique enables the evaluation of derivatives to high orders even in the case of only numerically solvable implicit dependences , such as in .",

    "details of this method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course , this ad approach is not limited to simple taylor series and can also be applied to more involved taylor expansions of physical quantities which also require temperature - derivatives .",

    "we start with a calculation of the @xmath63 phase diagram of the pqm model without referring to a taylor expansion . at vanishing chemical potential",
    "the chiral crossover , signaled here by a peak in the chiral susceptibility occurs at @xmath109 mev . at this temperature",

    "note that the difference in the radii of convergence , estimated from the @xmath19 and @xmath117 , respectively , is only caused by the prefactor in since the same taylor coefficients contribute to both estimators .",
    "near @xmath104 the sign of the expansion coefficients oscillates , indicating that the break down of the series expansion is caused by a singularity in the complex plane away from the real axis .",
    "the oscillations in the taylor coefficients entail oscillations in the radii of convergence at small chemical potentials which are hard to see in .",
    "hence , for small chemical potentials the radius of convergence is not suitable to estimate the phase boundary . for larger values of the chemical potential and for temperatures below @xmath104 estimates for the radius of convergence",
    "approach the phase boundary from above with increasing truncation order @xmath21 .",
    "the observed agreement suggests that the singularity limiting the taylor expansion is close to the real @xmath1-axis and the small imaginary part is negligible when compared to the error due to the finite number of coefficients available for a fast crossover .",
    "in particular , this is still valid for the region in the vicinity of the cep .",
    "we note that for @xmath119 corrections to the asymptotic value @xmath20 are well described in terms of @xmath27 corrections .",
    "in fact , with an ansatz @xmath120 for the estimators of the radius of convergence @xmath19 , the leading @xmath27 corrections can be eliminate by using subsequent estimates .",
    "this leads to estimates for @xmath20 obtained from the pressure and quark number susceptibility series that agree within a few percent and reach the asymptotic value within 15% for @xmath121 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 for the correction term , obtained in this way , is about a factor 5 larger in the pressure series than in the quark number susceptibility series .",
    "qualitatively , this different asymptotic behavior of both series can be understood in terms of the structure of the singular contribution to the grand potential that limits the radius of convergence .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in the appendix [ sec : crit ] .    at low temperatures the estimates for the radius of convergence increase with increasing order @xmath21 of the taylor expansion and allow also ratios @xmath122 .",
    "this is in agreement with the small magnitude of the higher order coefficients in this temperature region . in this region",
    "the results are in agreement with results from the resonance gas ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. the estimates of the convergence radius of the pressure are given by @xmath123 .",

    "therefore , @xmath19 as well as @xmath124 yield estimates for the radius of convergence that are larger than the true location of the first - order transition line and signal a misleading convergence of the taylor expansion . in this region",
    "the taylor expansion might provide stable and continuous results but one can not extract the precise position of the boundary for a first - order phase transition .       with @xmath19 and @xmath125 and poles in the pad approximation of the pressure and quark number susceptibility as a function of the order of the taylor expansion @xmath126 .",
    "the used highest coefficient is @xmath60 .",
    "the dotted horizontal line indicates the phase boundary calculated directly at finite @xmath1 .",
    "note also that an estimate is possible only for even pad approximations . ]",
    "the pad approximation could improve the convergence behavior and therefore provide a better estimate of the phase boundary since the pad approximant employs all taylor coefficients in contrast to the previous analysis where only two subsequent taylor coefficients enter .",
    "the pole in the @xmath50 $ ] pad approximation yields the corresponding radius of convergence as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : pade_approx ] . for a general @xmath127 $ ] pad approximation",
    "we use the first pole at real and positive @xmath1 in order to estimate the phase boundary .",
    "since all taylor coefficients with their corresponding error enter in the pad approximant the error propagation is more involved here in contrast to the previous discussion where only two error sources enter . in this context , the application of the pad approximation in lattice simulations is much more involved .",
    "however , in the model analysis the coefficients , obtained with the ad technique , exhibit extremely small numerical errors and result in a stable and reliable pad approximation .",

    "we show for a fixed temperature @xmath131 the estimates of the phase boundary extracted from pad approximations for the pressure ( @xmath40 ) and the quark number susceptibility ( @xmath132 ) for different truncation orders @xmath21 .",
    "the chosen temperature is slightly above the temperature of the cep in the phase diagram .",
    "in addition , the estimates for the radii of convergence ( @xmath19 and @xmath125 ) and the chiral crossover chemical potential ( dashed horizontal line ) are also shown . for small truncation orders @xmath133 the @xmath50 $ ] pad approximations coincide with the radii of convergence as expected . for @xmath134",
    "we observe that the pad approximation converges faster for the pressure as well as for the susceptibility compared to the radii of convergence obtained without the pad approximation .",
    "we conclude that the pad approximation converges faster at larger truncation orders , in particular for the quark number susceptibility .",
    "the estimate of the phase boundary from the pad approximation becomes comparable to the one obtained from estimators for the radius of convergence determined directly from ratios of taylor expansion coefficients only at significantly larger truncation order .",
    "for example , in the distance of the pad estimate to the horizontal line at @xmath135 is achieved with the taylor expansion only for @xmath136 .",
    "however , the lower truncation order in the pad approximation induces a more involved error propagation .",

    "however , it might still be possible to enter the metastable phase with the taylor expansion method . in this case the radius of convergence just reflects the fact that this expansion is still valid in the metastable phase . however , a precise determination of the first - order transition is not possible .",
    "this conceptual drawback is not modified when the pad approximation is employed .",

    "@xmath137 has been obtained from a taylor series truncated at 24@xmath140 order .",
    "the lines , labeled with pqm , represent the full model solution of the gap equation where a first - order transition can be resolved .",
    "both solutions agree very well in the low temperature phase until @xmath141 mev .",
    "the dotted line indicates the begin of the metastable phase .",
    "one sees that it is still possible to enter this metastable phase with the taylor expansion method . the vertical line in the figure marks the location of the estimate for the radius of convergence obtained for the chosen @xmath142 truncation order .",
    "furthermore , this example also demonstrates that the taylor expansion method is applicable also for @xmath122 as long as one stays within the convergence regime .",

    "hence , the radius of convergence might be well - suited to estimate the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram once the critical temperature is known .",
    "the corresponding critical chemical potential can again be obtained via @xmath143    from the discussion given so far and from fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpade ] one may conclude that at fixed temperature the radius of convergence can be estimated with an accuracy of about 15%-20% from a series of the order @xmath144 .",
    "this is clearly an acceptable uncertainty in view of the difficulties one has to face in current qcd calculations with non - zero chemical potential .",
    "however , the determination of @xmath145 is still a non - trivial task .",
    "a criterion is needed , that allows to estimate at a given order of the expansion the temperature regime in which all expansion coefficients may stay positive as discussed in sec .  [ sec : locating ] . as an example we show the zeros of the taylor series of the pressure in the complex @xmath4-plane around a temperature point where a coefficient changes its sign in appendix  [ sec : approots ] .",

    "there is still a temperature difference of the order of @xmath150 mev which is why we do not reconsider .",
    "in addition , this convergence behavior might be improved by applying the pad approximation but the identification of a proper convergence criterion is more involved as discussed in appendix  [ sec : approots ] .",
    "the convergence properties of the taylor expansion method which is used to extend lattice qcd calculations to non - zero chemical potential have been investigated .",
    "the method has been applied to an effective @xmath151 flavor polyakov ",
    "quark - meson model and the results obtained with the taylor expansion have been compared to a full model mean - field solution . by means of a novel algorithmic differentiation technique higher - order taylor coefficients",
    "could be calculated for the first time . as a function of the temperature",
    "the coefficients start to oscillate in the vicinity of the phase transition region .",
    "the number of roots and magnitude of the oscillations increase with the coefficient order .",
    "two definitions of the radius of convergence , one through the pressure series coefficients and the other one via the corresponding susceptibility coefficients have been discussed .",
    "the convergence of the estimators for the radius of convergence of the susceptibility series is faster than the corresponding one for the pressure series .    with the pad approximation the convergence rate could be further improved . by investigating the pole structure of the pad approximant a definition for the radius of convergence",
    "could be extracted and a better estimate for the phase boundary could be achieved .",
    "while the convergence radius yields the precise location of the phase boundary only for a second - order transition , i.e. , at the critical endpoint , we observed a good agreement of the convergence radius with the full model solution also for temperatures above @xmath145 . in view of the error of convergence radius due to the finite number of coefficients",
    "the convergence radius can provide a valuable estimate also for the location of a rapid crossover where the limiting singularity is close to the real axis in the complex @xmath1-plane .",
    "the singularity lies on the real axis only in the case where all coefficients are positive .",
    "this criterion also provides an estimate for the critical temperature @xmath146 . in our study",
    "this estimate depends only weakly on the truncation order .",
    "but even for truncation orders above @xmath152 there is still a significant gap to the full model solution and a precise determination of the location of the cep remains open .",
    "note that the error in estimating @xmath145 also affects the estimation of @xmath153 .",
    "although , the situation may be different in model calculations and in qcd , our study suggests that for a meaningful application of the taylor method to lattice qcd higher order taylor coefficients are definitely necessary in order to control systematically truncation errors in the series expansion and to estimate reliably the location of a possible critical endpoint in the qcd phase diagram . at present",
    "the available number of coefficients extracted in lattice qcd calculations is not sufficient to locate a critical endpoint in the qcd phase diagram with the taylor expansion method .",
    "however , if the critical endpoint is located at smaller temperatures a broader temperature interval is expected to emerge in which the taylor coefficients the taylor coefficients will oscillate . the estimators for the critical temperatures @xmath146",
    "are then expected to show a stronger temperature dependence and they should decrease faster .",
    "however , in this case also the cep may be located at large values of @xmath4 and higher orders in the expansion may be needed due to this .",
    "furthermore , when going beyond mean - field approximations in our model calculation , quantum and thermal fluctuations in the hadronic phase will surely modify the oscillations of the taylor coefficients .",
    "this too may improve the estimate of the critical temperature with the taylor expansion method .",
    "however , also in this case the location of a possible cep is shifted towards the @xmath1-axis @xcite and more coefficients are necessary for an adequate description . to explore this quantitatively",
    "we plan to extend the present study beyond mean - field as well as tightening the ad techniques with functional renormalization group methods .    with the taylor expansion method it is in general not possible to describe a first - order transition completely including the precise determination of the critical temperature since only information about one potential minimum are available .",
    "one may , however , establish upper bounds for the location of the phase boundary .",

    "the qcd critical point is expected to belong to the universality class of the three dimensional ising model .",
    "the critical behavior in the vicinity of this point is controlled by two couplings which characterize fluctuations in thermal and magnetic ( symmetry breaking ) directions of the effective ising hamiltonian .",
    "the chemical potential will mix with both couplings @xcite . when approaching the critical point in the @xmath63-plane the dominant singular contributions to , e.g. , the quark number susceptibility arise from the magnetic coupling .",
    "when approaching the critical endpoint in the qcd phase diagram at fixed temperature , the quark number susceptibility thus is expected to scale like @xcite @xmath154 which arises from a singular term in the grand potential , i.e. , the pressure which has the form , @xmath155 assuming that these singular terms give indeed the dominant contribution to the taylor expansion coefficients at high order , we obtain for the asymptotic behavior of the estimators for the radius of convergence ( @xmath156 ) of the pressure and quark number susceptibility series , respectively , @xmath157 we thus expect that in comparison to the pressure series , corrections to the radius of convergence are smaller in the quark number susceptibility series . in mean - field approximation , which is used in our current study , the relative factor is @xmath158 and it is about @xmath159 in the three dimensional ising model .",
    "indeed , this seems to be realized with the series discussed in this study , although the approach to the asymptotic value is slow .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : locating ] a singularity in the complex @xmath4-plane limits the radius of convergence of a taylor expansion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ylzero ] an example of the root distribution in the complex @xmath4-plane of a @xmath160 order taylor series of the pressure is given .",
    "the temperatures in the three panels are chosen such that the highest taylor coefficient @xmath161 changes sign while all the remaining coefficients stay positive . in the left panel @xmath161",
    "is still positive .",
    "as expected all 16 roots are complex and distributed on a circle whose radius corresponds to the radius of convergence @xmath162 . for @xmath163 ( middle panel )",
    "the taylor polynomial is of degree 14 and consequently only 14 roots emerge .",
    "approaching @xmath164 from positive values the two root pairs which are each closest to the imaginary axis merge to each one purely imaginary root and the other root vanishes at imaginary plus or minus infinity .",
    "when the temperature is further increased , i.e. , @xmath161 becomes negative ( right panel ) , two roots reenter the complex @xmath4-plane on the real @xmath1-axis from plus or minus infinity and rapidly approach the radius of convergence .    a similar analysis",
    "could also be performed with the pad approximation which shows , in general , a more rapid convergence behavior .",
    "however , the investigation for this case is more involved since two polynomials occur and possible root cancellations can emerge which are hard to distinguish numerically from real roots .",
    "in addition , deeper problems may further arise since the cep is related to a pole with a non - integer critical exponent which is generally difficult to describe properly within a pad approximation .",
