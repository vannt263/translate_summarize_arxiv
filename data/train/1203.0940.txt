    "gut monopoles are predicted to have appeared as topological defects at the phase transition of vacuum , where the gut gauge group spontaneously broke to leave the u(1 ) of electromagnetism .",
    "if we take as an example the temperature of the phase transition at which the monopoles were formed to equal 10@xmath11 gev and assume the average production rate of about one monopole per horizon at that time  @xcite , the density of the monopoles today would exceed the critical density of the universe by more than 14 orders of magnitude . even if we circumvent this problem by resorting to inflationary universe scenarios  @xcite",
    ", we can not avoid a large uncertainty on the monopole flux in the universe since the flux depends on such parameters as monopole mass and the reheating temperature .",
    "in fact , due to the wide variety of elementary particle models , several models are compatible with the level of the parker bound ( @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath4 s@xmath5",
    "sr@xmath5 )  @xcite , and a flux in that range can be relatively easily detected by underground experiments .",

    "@xcite pointed out that copious low energy neutrinos might be emitted when monopoles accumulating inside the sun catalyze proton decays , @xmath14 along their paths with cross sections typical of strong interactions via the callan - rubakov process  @xcite .",
    "when decay mesons produced by the above process subsequently decay into positive pions , ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are produced by the reactions , @xmath16     components are collectively denoted as @xmath17 since these two flavors of neutrinos have identical cross sections for electron scattering .",

    "[ fig : nue_spec_osc ] ) , and such neutrinos can be detected by a water cherenkov detector . throughout this paper , the neutrinos and antineutrinos",
    "are assumed to oscillate with the same parameters of @xmath19=0.31 , @xmath20=0.02 and @xmath21=@xmath22 ev@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the mixing angles are taken into account in the systematic errors .",
    "we searched for monopole - induced neutrinos using super - kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite , a large water cherenkov detector located inside japan s kamioka mine .",
    "sk is a high - performance neutrino detector consisting of 50,000 metric tons of pure water .",
    "since there are @xmath24-ray backgrounds near the wall , the fiducial volume for this search , which amounts to 22,500 metric tons , is defined to be more than two meters from the walls of the inner detector ( i d ) .",
    "monopole - induced neutrinos include all six types , and so for the monopole - induced neutrino search both electron elastic scattering , @xmath25 , and inverse beta decay , @xmath26 , were assumed to contribute .",
    "figure  [ fig : espec_osc ] shows the expected spectra of elastic scattering recoil electrons and inverse beta decay positrons in sk .",
    "the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effects  @xcite on oscillation in both the sun and the earth were also taken into account .",
    "we adopted a simple approximate analytic formula presented in ref .",

    "i.e. _ , the density changes so slowly inside the sun and the earth that the neutrino mass eigenstates propagate independently .",
    "the density profiles of the sun and the earth were taken from refs .",

    "in this analysis , we used 2853 live days of data consisting of sk - i ( apr .",

    "the energy resolution was worse because the number of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) was about half as many as those in the other phases .",
    "this difference in detector geometry was taken into account in the calculation of the expected spectra . however , as previously demonstrated by the sk solar neutrino analysis  @xcite , the broad energy spectra typical of monopole - induced neutrinos are hardly affected by the resolution .",
    "the background events of the monopole - induced neutrino events are mainly caused by the atmospheric neutrinos , the solar neutrinos and muon - induced spallation products . to remove the spallation products and the solar neutrino events , we set the lower energy thresholds to 19 mev for sk - i and iii , and 20 mev for sk - ii in this analysis .",
    "the upper energy threshold was set to 55 mev , which was determined by the end - point of the recoil electron ( or positron ) spectrum ( fig .",

    "@xmath17 represents @xmath27 and @xmath28 components.,title=\"fig : \" ]    besides setting the fiducial volume and energy criteria , some additional background cuts were applied to the data . after the event selection that removes cosmic ray muons and detector noise events , the data sample is subjected to a spallation cut .",
    "cosmic - ray muons can spall oxygen and create unstable nuclei called spallation products ( @xmath27 + @xmath29o @xmath30 @xmath27 + x ) .",
    "this is one of the most abundant backgrounds in the @xmath31 20 mev region , and as mentioned above , the ability to remove the background events mostly determines the lower threshold for the monopole - induced neutrino search .",
    "the spallation background events are reduced by a likelihood method that uses timing , position and photo - electron information of the muons preceding the candidate events .",
    "then , we applied the cherenkov opening angle cut to the remaining data sample .",
    "the opening angle is estimated by histogramming all the angles uniquely determined by the reconstructed vertex and the possible combinations of three hit pmts .",
    "the histogram is divided into 100 angle bins and the peak is located by finding the successive seven bins with the largest number of entries .",
    "the angle corresponding to the midpoint of the seven bins is regarded as the cherenkov angle of the event .",
    "most of the remaining visible atmospheric ( anti-)muon neutrino events are removed by this cut .",
    "electrons with e @xmath32 mev have a cherenkov angle @xmath33 of about 42@xmath34 , while visible muons remaining in the signal energy range have momenta less than @xmath12 250  mev / c , which corresponds to the maximum @xmath33 value of 36@xmath34 .",
    "thus , taking into account the finite resolution of the cherenkov angle measurements , events with @xmath33 @xmath35 38@xmath34 were removed .",
    "also we removed events with @xmath33 @xmath36 50@xmath34 .",
    "those events do not have a clear cherenkov ring pattern and originate from multiple @xmath24-rays emitted by excited nuclei created in neutral current ( nc ) interactions of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "some events originating from the outside of the fiducial volume are reconstructed within the fiducial volume of sk .",
    "these events are @xmath24-rays from the materials of the detector structure and the surrounding rock . to remove such events , we cut on the event s distance to the i d wall projected backwards from its vertex position along its reconstructed direction .",
    "events with this distance less than 300 cm were removed ( @xmath24-ray cut  @xcite ) .",
    "we removed charged @xmath37 background events based on the sharpness of the cherenkov ring pattern . as a charged @xmath37 interacts with or",
    "is absorbed by a nucleus and is less influenced by multiple coulomb scattering than electrons , it generates a sharp cherenkov ring pattern .",
    "events having two or more cherenkov rings were also removed .",
    "the remaining backgrounds include low energy muons produced by atmospheric @xmath1 charged current ( cc ) interactions and their decay electrons .",
    "those events are removed using time and spatial correlations ; any event pairs having a time difference and a spatial distance less than 50 @xmath27s and 500 cm , respectively , were removed . in case the candidate event is the second one in a pair , we removed event pairs with the first events having total photo - electrons ( p.e . ) more than 1000 p.e . for sk - i and iii , and 500 p.e . for sk - ii , which correspond to @xmath38 mev electron equivalent energy .",
    "although this selection ( decay electron cut ) removes some fraction of the atmospheric neutrino events , there still remain decay electrons which are not accompanied by nuclear de - excitation @xmath24-rays , and whose parent muons are invisible because their energies are below cherenkov threshold .",
    "those background events are distinguished from the signal events using angular correlation with the sun direction , which will be described later .",
    "the numbers of events remaining after each selection step are summarized in table  [ tab : reduction ] .",
