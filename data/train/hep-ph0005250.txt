    "recently diffractive phenomena in qcd have attracted considerable theoretical and experimental interests .",
    "in particular , diffractive photo- and leptoproductions of vector mesons off the proton , @xmath4 , provide crucial constraints on properties of the qcd pomeron and the vector meson wave functions@xcite . in this report , we focus on the heavy quarkonium production , where the heavy quark mass plays a role of the hard scale . due to the regge kinematics",
    ", the vector meson production can be understood as the scattering of the color dipole with the target nucleon . in this case",
    "we expect the amplitude to be dominated by the four diagrams illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "the upper part of each diagram , where the heavy quarks interact with two - gluons , is assumed to be calculated within perturbative qcd even for the photoproduction . on the other hand , the lower blob represents both non - perturbative structure ( impact factor ) of the proton and complicated gluon dynamics at small-@xmath5 which is identified with the qcd pomeron .",
    "the color dipole approach is adopted to evaluate the @xmath0 production in refs .",
    "@xcite , and gives reasonable results in agreement with the data .",
    "however , as pointed out by hoyer and peign@xcite very recently , the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections calculated in the dipole approximation is much smaller than the measured values@xcite at hera , when one uses typical non - relativistic quark models to obtain the charmonium wave functions .",
    "the formula used in the dipole approach@xcite is obtained by assuming that both transverse momentum of exchanged gluons and the transverse size of the @xmath6 pair are small .",
    "however , the non - relativistic quark model indicates that the typical size of @xmath7 is twice as large as the radius of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the validity of the small - size dipole approximation is questionable for @xmath8 and other mesons with the large radii .",
    "we may expect considerable contributions from the scattering of the color dipole with a large transverse fluctuation , if the @xmath9 and @xmath6 wave functions allow such a large separation between the quarks .",
    "above argument motivates us to calculate the diffractive @xmath10 and @xmath1 productions without resorting to the dipole approximation .",
    "let us briefly introduce the framework to calculate the diffractive heavy quarkonium production , which was developed in ref .",
    "we consider the forward heavy vector meson production @xmath11 shown in fig.1 with the kinematical condition @xmath12 . in this",
    "small-@xmath5 kinematics , the lifetime of a color - singlet quark - antiquark fluctuation is large compared to the typical interaction time scale@xcite .",
    "then the production amplitude can be expressed as a convolution of the @xmath13-proton cross section with the wave functions of initial ( @xmath9 ) and final ( @xmath14 ) states . in terms of light - cone wave functions of the photon @xmath15 and vector meson @xmath16 ,",

    "@xmath24 denotes the unintegrated gluon number density of the proton , which contains a complicated non - perturbative gluon ladder . @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 represent the qcd coupling constant and the ordinary bessel function of the first kind . after multiplying suitable functions of @xmath19 and kinematical factors , and carrying out @xmath19-integration",

    "( [ amp1 ] ) the photon wave function @xmath15 with 4-momentum square @xmath29 is calculated perturbatively , while @xmath16 is a non - perturbative object .",
    "we shall use the non - relativistic potential model which successfully reproduces the properties of the heavy quarkonium to evaluate @xmath30 . in the following calculations , we use two types of the potential ; the qcd motivated potential which essentially consists of linear and coulomb potentials@xcite , and a phenomenological logarithmic potential @xcite .",
    "our procedure to evaluate the light - cone wave functions is in line with those of refs .",
    "@xcite . solving the schrdinger equation with a potential @xmath31",
    ", we obtain non - relativistic wave functions @xmath32 , and also subsequently those in the momentum space @xmath33 through the fourier transformation .",
    "we make a simple kinematical identification between light - cone variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the transverse momenta of the quarks .",

    "( [ dipole ] ) the unintegrated gluon density has been identified with the gluon distribution function measured in dis via@xcite @xmath46 the approximation ( [ dipole ] ) is often called the color dipole approximation .",
    "it gives a simple physical interpretation of this process , in which the scattering amplitude of the @xmath13 dipole with the target has a geometrical expression , @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , the factorized formula eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) makes it possible to constrain the gluon distribution function of the proton from the diffractive vector meson production .",
    "typical results for @xmath48 production cross section obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) are available in refs .",
    "@xcite , and in agreement with the data .",
    "however , if we focus on @xmath1 , which is a radially excited @xmath49-state of the charmonium , the calculated ratio of @xmath50 to @xmath51 cross sections at the photoproduction point @xmath52 is much smaller than the experimental data as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the ratio calculated using eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) is shown by the dashed curve in fig.2 .",
    "although the theoretical prediction agrees with the data at larger @xmath29 , it has a factor 3 discrepancy at @xmath52 .",
    "we have tried to evaluate it with several potential models , but none of them can describe the data as far as the parameters of the potential are fixed to reproduce the charmonium properties@xcite .",
    "let us now examine carefully the dipole approximation which leads us to eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) . for the leptoproduction with large @xmath29 eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) works well , since the photon wave function projects out the @xmath6 fluctuation with the small transverse size .",
    "this approximation is also reasonable for the photoproduction of the @xmath53 heavy quarkonium due to the small transverse size of the @xmath0 .",
    "however , for the photoproduction of the radially excited vector mesons , it is not clear whether the small-@xmath43 expansion of eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) is valid .",
    "since the size of @xmath8 turns out to be about @xmath54 , twice as large as that of @xmath51 , in the typical non - relativistic quark model , the color dipole expansion may not work in this case .",
    "namely , there may exist non - negligible contributions to the integral eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) > from an overlap of the large - size @xmath6 configuration and the @xmath1 wave function .    in this work",
    "we explicitly evaluate eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) instead of using the simplified formula ( [ dipole ] ) .",
    "to do this , we need the explicit form of the unintegrated gluon density @xmath55 , which is not precisely known . here",
    ", we follow the prescription of refs .",
    "@xcite to carry out the @xmath23-integration in eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) by relating @xmath24 to the derivative of the gluon distribution ; @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a given function of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) , and @xmath58 plays a role of the infrared separation scale .",
    "using the cteq4lq@xcite parametrization for the gluon distribution and taking @xmath59 , we obtain the result shown in fig.2 . calculation without ( with ) the dipole approximation",
    "is depicted by the solid ( dashed ) curve . for large @xmath29",
    "the difference between them becomes small as expected .",
    "however , around @xmath52 , the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) with eq.([app ] ) clearly larger than the result obtained by eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) by factor about 2@xcite , and shows a reasonable agreement with the experimental data@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the major improvement of the ratio is caused by the contribution from the large - size @xmath13 fluctuation",
    ". there may be several other mechanisms to enhance the @xmath1 to @xmath48 ratio further , which will be discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "if we vary the value of @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , resulting ratio changes within a few @xmath63 .",
    "our results are also found to be insensitive to the choice of the potential model .",
    "we show in fig.3 results with grv98lo@xcite parametrization for the gluon distribution function ( thin - solid curve ) in comparison with those with the cteq4lq distribution ( thick - solid curve ) .",
    "calculated ratio is slightly modified due to the difference of the gluon distributions between cteq4 and grv98 at low @xmath29 .    for completeness , sensitivity of the results to @xmath64 is demonstrated in fig.3 , because several choices of @xmath64 are adopted in the literature@xcite . in fig.3 results with @xmath65 as an extreme case are shown by the thick - dashed ( cteq ) and thin - dashed ( grv ) curves , while those with @xmath66 by the solid curves .",
    "although increasing the upper limit of the @xmath23-integration improves the result , significant enhancement at @xmath52 comes from higher order terms of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) .",
    "we also consider the production of @xmath68-states .",
    "one can naively expect that the transverse separation @xmath20 is small enough to ensure the validity of the dipole expansion for the bottom quark case .",
    "results for @xmath69 and @xmath70 are shown in fig.4 .",
    "they are consistent with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by the dipole formula .",
    "there are only slight differences between the calculations without ( solid ) and with ( dashed ) the dipole approximation even for the @xmath71 case , whose radius is about @xmath72 .    in conclusion , we have studied the diffractive photo- and leptoproduction of radially excited heavy quarkonia , and discussed the validity of the small - size color dipole approximation , which gives the smaller value of the @xmath1 to @xmath0 ratio compared with the experimental data .",
    "it is pointed out that the contribution from the higher order terms of @xmath67 in the @xmath13-nucleon scattering amplitude , which is inherent in the original formula eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) , is important for the radially excited @xmath1 case .",
    "we have demonstrated that the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) without the dipole approximation provides a much larger value for the elastic photoproduction ratio @xmath73 than the dipole result , and is consistent with the hera data . as claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , relativistic treatment of the charmonium system may be of some importance to construct the @xmath1 wave function .",
    "however , what we have shown here is that , even within our non - relativistic framework where there are some ambiguities of choosing the kinematics _",

    "our results suggest that a careful treatment is necessary to study the radially excited light vector meson leptoproduction , _",
