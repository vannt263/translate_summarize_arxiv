    "an ordinary real ( or archimedean ) fractal string is a bounded open subset of the real line , with fractal boundary .",
    "it provides a complementary perspective to the notion of a self - similar fractal , in the sense that every self - similar string determines a self - similar set in @xmath2 , viewed as the boundary of the string .",
    "moreover , it is noteworthy that the geometric zeta function of a fractal string determines the fractal ( i.e. , minkowski ) dimension of the corresponding fractal set . following the examples of the @xmath3-string and of the archimedean cantor string given by the first author in  @xcite , the notion of an archimedean fractal string was conceived and defined by michel lapidus and carl pomerance in their investigation of the one - dimensional weyl  berry conjecture for fractal drums and its connection with the riemann zeta function  @xcite .",
    "the riemann hypothesis turned out to be equivalent to the solvability of the corresponding inverse spectral problem for fractal strings , as was established by michel lapidus and helmut maier in  @xcite .",
    "the heuristic notion of complex dimensions then started to emerge and was used in a crucial way , at least heuristically , in their spectral reformulation of the riemann hypothesis .",
    "the precise notion of complex dimensions , defined as the poles of a certain geometric zeta function associated with the fractal string , was crystallized and rigorously developed by michel lapidus and machiel van frankenhuijsen in the research monograph _ fractal geometry and number theory _",
    "@xcite and then significantly further extended in the book _ fractal geometry , complex dimensions and zeta functions _  @xcite .    the work of lapidus and maier mentioned above can be summarized as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the inverse spectral problem for a fractal string can be solved if and only if its dimension is not @xmath4 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the inverse spectral problem for a fractal string is not solvable in dimension 1/2 because the riemann zeta function @xmath5 vanishes ( infinitely often ) on the critical line @xmath6 . therefore , the inverse spectral problem is solvable in dimension @xmath7 if and only if the riemann zeta function does not vanish off the critical line @xmath6 or , equivalently , if and only if the riemann hypothesis is true . in order to understand why dimension @xmath4 is so special , michel lapidus  @xcite ( building ,",
    "in particular , on earlier work in  @xcite and in  @xcite ) , as well as michel lapidus and machiel van frankenhuijsen @xcite , were led to a definition of the dual of a fractal string , interchanging the dimensions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . a partial answer to the question why @xmath4 is singled out",
    "is that if a fractal string is self - dual , then its dimension is @xmath4 .",
    "the concept of the dual of a fractal string provides a geometric way to take the functional equation of the riemann zeta function into consideration in the theory of complex dimensions .",
    "such considerations would not be complete if they did not also involve the euler product of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the spectral operator was introduced semi - heuristically in  @xcite as the map that sends the geometry of a fractal string onto its spectrum .",
    "formally , the spectral operator admits an ( operator - valued ) euler product . in @xcite , hafedh herichi and michel lapidus",
    "have rigorously defined and studied the spectral operator , within a proper functional analytic setting .",
    "they have also reformulated the above criterion for the riemann hypothesis in terms of a suitable notion of invertibility of the spectral operator ; see also @xcite for a corresponding asymmetric criterion , expressed in terms of the usual notion of invertibility of the spectral operator .",
    "furthermore , they have shown that the ( operator - valued or `` quantized '' ) euler product for the spectral operator also converges _ inside _ the critical strip @xmath10 where all the ( nontrivial ) complex zeros of the riemann zeta function reside .    in order to extend the framework of the theory of complex dimensions , with an aim towards applying ideas and techniques from number theory to the inverse spectral problem , it is therefore natural to attempt developing a theory of @xmath0-adic fractal strings , and then globally , an adlic theory of fractal strings . further laying out the foundations for such",
    "a theory is one of the main long - term goals of this paper .",
    "we note that nonarchimedean @xmath0-adic analysis has been used in various areas of mathematics , such as arithmetic geometry , number theory and representation theory , as well as of mathematical and theoretical physics , such as string theory , cosmology , quantum mechanics , relativity theory , quantum field theory , statistical and condensed matter physics ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite and the relevant references therein .",
    "in particular , igor volovich has suggested that @xmath0-adic numbers can possibly be used in order to describe the geometry of spacetime at very high energies ( and hence , very small scales , i.e. , below the planck or the string scale ) because the measurements in the ` archimedean ' geometry of spacetime at fine scales do not have any certainty  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several authors have also suggested that the fine scale structure of spacetime may be fractal ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a geometric theory of @xmath0-adic fractal strings and their complex dimensions might be helpful in the quest to explore the geometry and fine scale structure of spacetime at high energies .    on the other hand , in the book entitled _ in search of the riemann zeros :",
    "strings , fractal membranes and noncommutative spactimes _",
    "@xcite , michel lapidus has suggested that fractal strings and their quantization , fractal membranes , may be related to aspects of string theory and that @xmath0-adic ( and possibly , adlic ) analogs of these notions would be useful in this context in order to better understand the underlying noncommutative spacetimes and their moduli spaces ( [ ] ) .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-adic fractal strings , once suitably ` quantized ' , may be helpful in further developing some of these ideas and eventually providing a framework for unifying the real and @xmath0-adic fractal strings and membranes .    in this paper",
    ", we further develop the geometric theory of @xmath0-adic ( or nonarchimedean ) fractal strings , which are bounded open subsets of the @xmath0-adic @xmath11 with a fractal `` boundary '' , along with the associated theory of complex dimensions and , especially , of fractal tube formulas in the nonarchimedean setting .",
    "this theory , which was first developed by michel lapidus and l  hng in  @xcite , as well as later , by those same authors and machiel van frankenhuijsen in  @xcite , extends the theory of real ( or archimedean ) fractal strings and their complex dimensions in a natural way . following  @xcite",
    ", we introduce suitable geometric zeta functions for @xmath0-adic fractal strings whose poles play the role of complex dimensions for the standard real fractal strings .",
    "we also discuss the explicit fractal tube formulas in the general case of ( languid ) @xmath0-adic fractal strings and in the special case of @xmath0-adic self - similar strings . throughout this paper ,",
    "these various results are illustrated in the case of the nonarchimedean self - similar cantor and the fibonacci strings ( introduced in  @xcite ) , as well as in the case of the @xmath0-adic euler string ( introduced in  @xcite ) , which ( strictly speaking ) is not self - similar .",
    "some particular attention is devoted to the 3-adic cantor string ( introduced and studied in  @xcite ) , whose ` metric ' boundary is the 3-adic cantor set  @xcite , which is naturally homeomorphic to the classic ternary cantor set .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in  [ pfs ] and  [ gzf ] , we recall the definition of an arbitrary @xmath0-adic fractal string along with its associated geometric zeta function and complex dimensions , as well as the corresponding notions of minkowski dimension and content . furthermore , in  [ inner tube ] , we discuss the important , but more technical , question of how to suitably define and calculate the volume of the ` inner ' @xmath12-neighborhood of a @xmath0-adic fractal string . the definitions and proofs given in ",
    "[ inner tube ] depend crucially on the nonarchimedean ( specifically , @xmath0-adic ) nature of the underlying geometry . in  [ mdimension ] , we then introduce a proper notion in this context of minkowski dimension and minkowski content , building on the results of  [ inner tube ] . moreover , we obtain the nonarchimedean analog of a key result in ( archimedean ) fractal string theory , showing that the minkowski dimension of a @xmath0-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of its geometric zeta function .",
    "( in the process , we show that this common value coincides with the asymptotic growth rate of the geometric counting function of the fractal string , a result which is new even in the archimedean setting , even though it may be implicit in @xcite . )",
    "our proof also provides a new and unified derivation of the archimedean result for real fractal strings ( @xcite , @xcite ) , by placing the archimedean and the nonarchimedean settings on the same footing ; see  [ trc ] . in  [ explicit tf ] , we then use our previous results ( in  [ inner tube ] and  [ mdimension ] ) to express the volume of the inner tube of a @xmath0-adic fractal string as an infinite sum over all the underlying complex dimensions , thereby obtaining a nonarchimedean analog of the ` fractal tube formula ' obtained for real ( or archimedean ) fractal strings in  @xcite .",

    "<S> the theory of complex dimensions describes the oscillations in the geometry ( spectra and dynamics ) of fractal strings . </S>",
    "<S> such geometric oscillations can be seen most clearly in the explicit volume formula for the tubular neighborhoods of a @xmath0-adic fractal string @xmath1 , expressed in terms of the underlying complex dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the general fractal tube formula obtained in this paper is illustrated by several examples , including the nonarchimedean cantor and euler strings . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the minkowski dimension of a @xmath0-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function associated with the string , as well as with the growth rate of the corresponding geometric counting function . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this new result can be applied to both real and @xmath0-adic fractal strings and hence , yields a unifying explanation of a key result in the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings , even in the archimedean ( or real ) case .            _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere . </S>",
