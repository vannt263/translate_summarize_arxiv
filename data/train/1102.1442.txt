    "sn  1996cr , located comparatively nearby in the circinus galaxy ( 3.7 mpc , @xmath0 ) was serendipitously detected as a ulx at an age of @xmath15 years @xcite .",
    "as detailed in @xcite :   i ) followup archival research and vlt observations ( at age @xmath110 years ) allowed sn  1996cr to be classified as a type iin sne , and ii ) archival x - ray data showed that it was not detected at an age of @xmath11000 days , yet brightened to @xmath2 erg / s ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) after 10 years . this x - ray behavior is shared only with sn 1987a , and is roughly shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] in the context of other x - ray - detected sne and core - collapse ( cc ) snrs . because of this behavior , and given an indication of doppler structure in 2004 _ chandra _  hetg data , we proposed and obtained a deep , 485  ks hetg observation ( pi bauer ) near the beginning of 2009 .",
    "in large part because of the high quality of this recent data we were able to tune a 1-d hydrodynamic model to agree with the _ multi - epoch _ x - ray data ( next section ) , and we are now investigating signatures of the ejecta / csm geometry in the hetg line shapes ( last section . )",
    "vs age plot from @xcite .",
    "unlike other x - ray - bright sne , these two show a dramatic ( re-)brightening at ages of a few years to decades . as these and other sne age",
    "we will begin to fill in the cc sne - snr gap seen between ages of 30 to 300 years .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve],scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    a 1-d ( spherical ) hydrodynamic model of the ejecta - csm interaction is developed in @xcite ; post - processing calculates the x - ray emission from the non - radiative shocks , showing good agreement with the measured x - ray light curve and spectra at multiple epochs .",
    "given our inferred configuration , figure  [ fig:1dhydro ] , a realistic evolutionary scenario for sn  1996cr s progenitor has it evolving from the rsg to the w - r stage , creating a wind - blown bubble with a dense shell at about 0.04  pc , and then exploding as a sn .",
    "some conclusions from the modeling are that :    * the 1-d model explains the majority of the observed x - ray continuum and lines , and their variation in time . *",
    "the velocities of plasma in the model agree with the scale of the line broadening seen in the hetg data . *",
    "the inner ejecta core is opaque to hetg x - rays as late as 2009 when it has a plateau density of @xmath6  amu@xmath7 and a radius of 0.065  pc , giving a column density along the diameter of 4.0@xmath8@xmath9  amu@xmath10 of high - z material . * initially the flux from the forward - shocked shell dominates .",
    "however , at @xmath18 years the reverse - shocked ejecta contributes 50% of the flux , this fraction grows to @xmath170% at 1520 years . * some small fraction ( by mass / volume ) of denser csm is needed to produce some low - ionization lines seen in the x - ray spectrum ; this `` clump '' emission is a small perturbation on the main hydrodynamics .",
    "&  [ fig : contours ] .",
    "[ fig : linefits],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    with a general hydrodynamic picture established , we are now looking at detailed line - shape fitting of a handful of the lines , in particular si and fe - k lines shown in figure  [ fig : linefits ] . using simple 3-d modeling techniques @xcite we compared the hetg data with the line shapes expected from our 1-d model ( with spherical symmetry and an opaque core ) and found that , while there is qualitative agreement , there are statistically significant departures from this simple model .",
    "since the sne is unresolved in the x - ray ( and only just resolved by vlbi in 2007 @xcite ) we explore simple , plausible geometric modifications that can better fit the line shapes .",
    "one option is to retain the 1-d radial solution ( i.e. , densities and velocities ) , but to restrict the interaction and emission to less than the full @xmath11 solid angle ; examples of such geometries are shown in figure  [ fig : lineshapes ] . in reality , this approximation could be appropriate if either the csm is non - uniform or if the explosion / ejecta is not spherically symmetric .",
    "of course this truncation of the solid angle also reduces the model flux , but a flux factor of up to a few can be accomodated with small changes to the parameters ( density , radii ) and still obtain light curve and spectral agreement .    comparing models with data in figures  [ fig : linefits ]  &  [ fig : contours ] , we find that the line shapes are well fit by `` polar '' models consisting of uniform emission within a half - opening angle of the poles : within @xmath16070 degrees for si and other lines and within @xmath11030 degrees for the fe xxvi line . in all cases",
    "the polar axis is consistent with being oriented at @xmath15060 degrees to our line - of - sight ; this leads to the schematic image shown in figure  [ fig : contours ] ( the position angle is arbitrary . )    a preliminary sensitivity study of the effects of changing the hydrodynamic parameters suggests that the easiest way to get more fe xxvi emission is to increase the swept up mass at high lattitudes , rather than , say , changing the ejecta mass or energy along that direction .",
    "we are currently in the processes of creating a more realistic model to take this and the optical line shapes into account .",
    "perhaps in the future similar csm / ejecta sleuthing will be possible for more sne and even gamma - ray burst remnants .",
    "show the si and fe fits ; the image at right is the implied geometry .",
