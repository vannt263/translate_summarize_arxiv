    "the equivalence between a black body and a black hole(bh)both emitting thermal radiation ( using semi - classical description ) put a new era for black hole physics .",
    "the black hole behaves as a thermodynamical system with the temperature ( known as hawking temperature)and the entropy proportional to the surface gravity at the horizon and the area of the horizon [ 1,2 ] respectively .",
    "further , this temperature , entropy and mass of a black hole are related by the first law of thermodynamics [ 3 ] . on the other hand , the thermodynamic parameters namely , the temperature and entropy are characterized by the space time geometry .",
    "so a natural speculation about some relationship between black hole thermodynamics and einstein equations is legitimate .",
    "in fact , jacobson [ 4 ] showed that einstein equations can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath0 , for all local rindler causal horizons with @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the energy flux and unruh temperature measured by an accelerated observer just inside the horizon , while on the other way padmanabhan [ 5 ] derived the first law of thermodynamics on the horizon , starting from einstein equations for general static spherically symmetric space - time .",
    "+ this equivalence between the thermodynamical laws and the einstein gravity subsequently leads to generalize this idea in cosmology , treating universe as a thermodynamical system .",
    "more precisely , if we assume that the universe is bounded by the apparent horizon @xmath3 with temperature @xmath4 and entropy @xmath5 then the friedmann equations and the first law of thermodynamics ( on the apparent horizon ) are equivalent [ 6 ] . usually , the universe bounded by the apparent horizon is termed as a bekenstein system because bekenstein s entropy - mass bound @xmath6 and entropy - area bound ( @xmath7 ) are obeyed in this region .",
    "on the otherhand , the cosmological event horizon does not exist in the usual standard big bang model while it exists in an accelerating universe dominated by dark energy @xmath8 .",
    "however , both the first and second law of thermodynamics break down on the event horizon [ 7 ] . using the usual definition of temperature ( as on the apparent horizon )",
    "wang et al [ 7 ] have argued that the applicability of the first law of thermodynamics is restricted to nearby states of local thermodynamic equilibrium while event horizon characterizes the global features of space time .",
    "+ the present observational evidences obtained from wilkinson - microwave - anisotropy - probe(wmap ) strongly suggest that the current expansion of the universe is accelerating [ 8,9 ] .",
    "there are two possible ways [ 10 - 15 ] of explaining this accelerated expansion of the universe.in the frame work of general relativity it can be explained by introducing the dark energy having negative pressure .",
    "the other possibility is to consider modified gravity theory such as @xmath9 gravity [ 15,16,17 ] , where the action is an arbitrary function @xmath10 of the scalar curvature @xmath11 . as a result , the friedmann equations [ 18,19 ] become complicated by including powers of ricci scalar @xmath11 and its time derivatives . in the present work ,",
    "we examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event horizon ( which exists due to present accelerating phase of the universe ) .",
    "the matter in the universe is taken in the form of interacting two fluid system- one component is dust and the other is in the form of dark energy .",
    "+ the model of dark energy obeying holographic principle is termed as holographic dark energy . from the effective quantum field theory ,",
    "the energy density for the holographic dark energy is given by [ 20 ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an ir cut - off in units @xmath14 , c is any free dimension less parameter , determined from observational data [ 21 ] .",
    "li [ 22 ] has argued that ( also from the present context ) the cut off length @xmath13 can be chosen as the radius of the event horizon to get correct equation of state and desired accelerating universe .",
    "very recently , wei and cai [ 23 ] proposed another model of dark energy known as new age graphic dark energy ( nade ) which may have interesting cosmological consequences ( originally cai[24 ] proposed an age graphic dark energy model(ade ) which is unable to describe the matter dominated era ) .",
    "these new dark energy models are based on the uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics and gravitational effect due to einstein gravity .",
    "also the nade models are constrained by various astronomical observations [ 25].although the evolution behavior of the nade has similarity [ 26 ] with the holographic dark energy but the causality problem in the holographic dark energy model can be overcome in ade by choosing the age of the universe as the measure of the length ( instead of the horizon distance ) while the conformal time @xmath15 is chosen as the time scale in nade .",
    "thus the energy density of the nade can be written as @xmath16 where the conformal time @xmath17 has the expression @xmath18 and the numerical factor @xmath19 is taken care of uncertainties in quantum theory and the effect of curved space time . + the paper is organized as follows . in the section ( ii )",
    "the holographic dark energy model has been used while recently formulated new age graphic dark energy model is taken in section ( iii ) .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section ( iv ) .",
    "in this section , we take the frw universe bounded by the event horizon and the matter in the universe is taken as the holographic dark energy ( hde ) interacting with dust . so the energy density of the hde model has the expression @xmath20 the individual continuity equations for the hde and dust are of the form @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 [ 27 ] is the interaction term and the decay rate @xmath24 corresponds to conversion of dark energy to dust .",
    "the above conservation equations can be written in non - interacting form as [ 27 ] @xmath25 and @xmath26 these equations show that the interacting matter system is equivalent to non - interacting two fluid system with variable equation of state @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ratio of two energy densities . so combining ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we get @xmath29 where @xmath30 for frw universe with line element @xmath31 the friedmann equations are @xmath32 and @xmath33 with  @xmath34  .",
    "now as usual the density parameters are @xmath35 and due to the first friedmann equation they are related by the relation @xmath36 now using the friedmann equations , the conservation relations and the expression for the energy density of the holographic dark energy ( eq.(2 ) ) , the equation of state parameter @xmath37 for the hde can be obtained as [ 27 ] @xmath38 where the decay rate is chosen as [ 27 ] @xmath39 with @xmath40 as the coupling constant .",
    "+ the deceleration parameter @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of density parameters ( using friedmann equations and the conservation relations ) as @xmath42 now using the expression for the energy density of holographic dark energy ( eq.(2 ) ) and the modified conservation equation ( 5 ) the change in the radius of the event horizon is given by [ 28 ] @xmath43 assuming the validity of the first law of thermodynamics on the event horizon and using the expression for the amount of energy crossing the event horizon in time dt [ 6,29,30 ] i.e. @xmath44 we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the entropy of the event horizon and @xmath47 is the temperature on the event horizon .",
    "+ from the gibb s equation [ 31 ] @xmath48 the variation of the entropy @xmath49 of the fluid inside the event horizon is given by @xmath50 in deriving eq.(19 ) we have used eq.(9 ) and the following expressions @xmath51 hence combining equations ( 10 ) and ( 19 ) the resulting change of total entropy is given by @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54\\ ] ]",
    "similar to the previous section , the matter in the universe bounded by the event horizon is taken as interacting two fluid system- one component is in the form of recently formulated new age graphic dark energy and the other is the dark matter in the form of dust . so as before the time variation of the entropy of the horizon can be obtained from the first law of thermodynamics with expression @xmath45 where @xmath55 here the energy density of the dust component @xmath56 satisfies the conservation equation ( 4)(or ( 6 ) ) while the nade has energy density and pressure @xmath57 and @xmath58 with equation of state @xmath59 .",
    "this matter component satisfies the continuity equation ( 3 ) or ( 5 ) .",
    "also the effective state parameters have the same form as in equation(7 ) .",
    "further , an explicit form of @xmath57 is given in equation ( 1 ) in terms of conformal time .",
    "in contrast to hde , the nade energy density ( given in equation(1 ) ) is not related to the radius of the event horizon .",
    "so from the definition of the event horizon , the time variation of @xmath60 is given by [ 32 ] @xmath61    then using gibbs equation , the time variation of the entropy of the matter inside event horizon is given by @xmath62 thus combining equation ( 21 ) and ( 23 ) the change of total entropy is given by    @xmath63    further for the new age graphic dark energy the expressions of the equation of state parameters @xmath64 and the deceleration parameter @xmath65 in terms of the density parameters are the following : @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 as the density parameter .",
    "now the validity of gslt demands @xmath84 and @xmath85 which gives @xmath86 ( which agree with [ 34])and consequently @xmath87 + note that the above restriction on @xmath88 agrees with that in ref.[34 ]",
    ". thus the holographic dark energy model may be of phantom nature for the validity of the gslt as shown in fig(i ) .",
    "+      fig.i  fig.ii + figi . shows the variation of @xmath37 for holographic dark energy model against the parameter @xmath89 which ranges in [ 0,0.542218 ] i.e. @xmath90 and figii . shows the variation of @xmath64 for new age graphic dark energy model against the parameter @xmath89",
    "whose range is [ 0,0.66483 ] i.e. @xmath91    from the observed data , @xmath81 and @xmath64 are the following @xmath92 @xmath93 now @xmath84 gives an upper bound for @xmath94 as @xmath91 which gives the explicit restrictions on @xmath81 and @xmath64 in the following manner:@xmath95 + hence in this case also [ we can find from fig(ii ) ] the gslt may be valid in quintessence era as well as in phantom era .",
    "therefore , the phantom divide line has no influence on the validity of the gslt in both the dark energy models i.e. there may be a smooth transition between the quintessence and phantom era in the new age graphic dark energy model .",
    "finally , we note that to examine the validity of gslt we have not used any explicit form of entropy or temperature at the event horizon only we have imposed the condition that the first law of thermodynamics is valid here which may be considered as an conservation equation ( since we have assumed that the universe is in thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "however in ref.[7 ] it has been shown that the usual definition of the temperature ( hawking temperature ) and entropy ( bekenstein entropy ) do not hold on the event horizon and consequently the first law of thermodynamics is not satisfied on the event horizon .",
    "therefore , for future work we examine the validity of the first law thermodynamics with appropriate choice of entropy and temperature on the event horizon .",
