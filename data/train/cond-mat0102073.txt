    "[ sec : int ] lipkin , meshkov and glick @xcite proposed in 1965 an exactly solvable two - level many - fermion model which has been used to test various kinds of many - body theories . the model hamiltonian reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the coupling constant , @xmath2 is the energy difference between the two levels , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the degree of degeneracy of each level .",
    "the single particle states are labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath5 the operators @xmath6 satisfy the commutation relations of the @xmath7 algebra .",
    "the transformation associated with the unitary operator @xmath8 leaves the hamiltonian invariant . if @xmath9 the mean field groundstate of the model is classified according to the trivial representation of the symmetry group .",
    "the symmetry is spontaneously broken if @xmath10    a splitting of the levels is then observed , which is analogous to the occurrence of rotational bands in deformed nuclei .",
    "the model is also of great interest in condensed matter physics , since it is related to the anysotropic heisenberg model . in the strong coupling limit , @xmath11 the level",
    "splitting vanishes for odd @xmath12 this behaviour is easily understood in the framework of kramers theorem and is related to the well known phenomenon of tunnelling suppression for odd spin anysotropic heisenberg ferromagnets .    in this paper",
    "we formulate a general physical picture of the calculation of the ground state energy and its splitting by the instanton method .",
    "such method was applied to the anisotropic heisenberg model for description of the tunneling of the magnetic moment of small magnetic particles with large spin @xcite .",
    "although the physical picture of the spin tunneling was formulated in these papers the quantitative results of the papers @xcite are not completely correct .",
    "we show that special care is required when computing the instanton contributions in order to take also correctly into account the small amplitude quantum fluctuations . on more technical language",
    "the functional determinants have to be calculated very accurately taking properly into account the operator ordering generating the functional integral for the partition sum .",
    "we show that it is essential to keep in mind that the fuctional integral is generated by the spin coherent state method . taking accurately into account the discrete nature in time of the functional leads to essential corrections to the ground state energy and to its tunneling splitting . after taking into account all these contribution",
    "our result completely coinsides with the one of @xcite obtained by the semiclassical method and the contradiction existing in literature is resolved .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follws . in sec .",

    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian of the model in the rotated reference frame @xmath13 here we assume that the magnitude of spin @xmath14 .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) describes interaction between nucleons , the second one represents an energy splitting and can be regarded as an external magnetic field .",
    "the choice of the coordinate axis is determined by the convenience condition for further calculations .",
    "the lipkin model can be reduced to the anisotropic heisenberg model @xcite . for",
    "that we add to the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) the term @xmath15 and the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) takes the form @xmath16 in the language of the heisenberg model the magnetic field here is in the direction of the second axis @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 of the paper @xcite is @xmath19 for our case .",
    "we concentrate our attention on the accurate treatment of the ground state energy of the model and its tunneling splitting when the second term in ( [ 1 ] ) is absent or @xmath20 .    in this special case",
    "the lipkin model is invariant under the time reflection . in the case of half - integer spin @xmath21",
    "this symmetry leads to the two - fold kramer s degeneracy of the ground state @xcite . in the case of integer spin",
    "@xmath21 instead of degeneracy we have the splitting of the ground state .",
    "this splitting has to be small because for large @xmath21 the difference between integer and half - integer spin has to be small .",
    "in fact this splitting is exponentially small .    to solve this problem",
    "we have used the instanton method @xcite applied to the functional integral for the partition function of our spin system in terms of spin coherent states @xcite .",
    "the coherent states are given by the following formula @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a complex number .",

    "this hamiltonian is unusual because the mass depends on the coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "the second essential peculiarity is the presence in the action of the term @xmath44 which separates integer and half - integer spins @xcite . in spite of that the ground state energy and the splitting can be found .",

    "comparing these two expressions we get    @xmath244    therefore the constant @xmath245([42 ] ) which determines the instanton contribution to the partition function is @xmath246 the normalization constant @xmath85 completely disappears from the final expression for the constant @xmath245 .",
    "this expression completely coincides with that one ( [ 42 ] ) which was obtained on the basis of paper @xcite for the action integrated out over the variable @xmath68 .",

    "practically they are the same quantities because by change of variables of integration they can be reduced to each other .",
    "at first we explain a mechanism of such corrections on a qualitative level and after that we apply it to our case .",
    "let us suppose that each variable @xmath251 in the measure ( [ a19 ] ) has a small multiplicative correction of the order @xmath249 @xmath252 this factor @xmath253 to @xmath254 can be presented in an exponential form and it is different from unity @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the correction to the classical action .",

    "let us suppose that the matrix @xmath263 can be presented in a form @xmath264 where the operator @xmath265 represents some discrete version of the operator @xmath204 of ( [ a3 ] ) and the operator @xmath266 represents some discrete version of the second order differential operator @xmath267 where functions @xmath268 are some smooth functions of time @xmath224 of the order of unity .",
    "simple arguments shows that the contribution to the determinant due to the @xmath269 term is always small contrary to the contributions of the @xmath270 and @xmath271 terms which are of order of unity . to demonstrate this statement",

    "we can produce all calculations of the measure and the determinant for the instanton contribution with the necessary accuracy .",
    "for that we begin by interpreting the integration over the variables @xmath287 and @xmath288 ( @xmath289 and @xmath290 ) in expression ( [ 4 ] ) for the partition function @xmath154 as an integral over the two - dimensional surface @xmath291 and @xmath292 of the four dimensional space where variables @xmath287 and @xmath288 are considered as complex variables . because the function @xmath293 is an analytic function of the variables @xmath287 and @xmath288 it can be continued in the four - dimensional complex manifold and in this way we can arrive to the instanton saddle point . in the neighborhood of the saddle point we have to integrate over the two - dimensional manifold which realizes the directions of steep descent .",
    "the direction of steep descent is chosen correctly if all eigenvalues of the quadratic form in the exponent of the action are real",
    ".    this program can be realized with the help of the following change of variables @xmath286 and @xmath32 in the neighborhood of the saddle point : @xmath294 here we understand @xmath295 and @xmath296 as classical ( nonfluctuating ) variables connected with the previously introduced variables @xmath297 and @xmath298 by the relations : @xmath299 thus the variables @xmath295 and @xmath296 are not in our case complex conjugated .",
    "we shall understand that the classical variables @xmath295 and @xmath296 or @xmath300 satisfy the classical equations of motion which determine the saddle point with corrections of order @xmath105 taken into account .",
    "this means that only in the main approximation the variables @xmath301 are equal to @xmath302 determined by eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "the difference between variables @xmath301 and variables @xmath303 is of order @xmath105 and is determined by small corrections of order of @xmath105 contained in the action @xmath108 ( [ a29 ] ) and corrections to the action @xmath304 ( [ a30 ] ) and @xmath305 ( [ a31 ] ) .",
    "it is fortunate that these corrections are nonessential to our problem .",
    "the reason for that is the canonical form of the measure ( [ a18 ] ) in terms of the variables @xmath306 .",
    "notice that the change of variables ( [ a32 ] ) was stimulated by formulas of differentiation over time of the quantities @xmath307 and @xmath308 .    at this stage",
    "we can calculate the renormalization of the functional determinant due to the @xmath105-corrections .",
    "this can be done on the basis of the following formula for the decomposition of the action in the neighborhood of the saddle point : @xmath309 this formula strongly simplifies the calculations and can be proved if we consider the original variables @xmath32 and @xmath286 as function of variables @xmath306 from one hand and the variables @xmath300 from another .",
    "the matrix @xmath265 can be chosen on the basis ( [ a35 ] ) in the form @xmath310 where the functions @xmath311 and @xmath312 were determined in eq .",

    "@xmath266 it is sufficient to keep the second derivative only . for nondiagonal elements we have to keep the first and the second derivatives . acting with the operator @xmath266 on the green s function @xmath325 and calculating the trace we get for the correction to the action @xmath256 @xmath326 since we are interested in the ratio of determinants we subtract from the function @xmath327 its value at the trivial saddle - point @xmath328 . using eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) for @xmath329 we get the final expression for the correction to the instanton action @xmath256 @xmath330 the obtained result is surprisingly simple .",
    "it can be found if we change in the expression for the energy splitting ( [ 45 ] ) @xmath331 .",
    "such change has a quasiclassical meaning and can be found by a simpler manner then in this section .",
    "finaly , l result we have instead of the expression ( [ 45 ] ) for the ground state energy @xmath50 and for the instanton splitting @xmath332 this result completely coinsides with the result of @xcite for the case @xmath333 .",
    "in this section we will compare the exact ground - state energy and splitting with the results obtained in the above discussion , namely eq([45 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is easily diagonalized on the basis of the eigenfunctions of @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "the ground  state belongs to the symmetric representation and , so , we will just consider this representation for different values of the total spin @xmath21 . in table",
    "i the numerical results and the theoretical ones for the ground - state energy ( [ 19 ] ) and its splitting ( [ 45 ] ) are presented . as expected the relative error between the calculated and the exact ground - state energy decreases with @xmath21 .",
    "let consider the explicit form of the spin operators acting on the space of functions @xmath337 the spin operators have the form @xcite @xmath338 substituting this representation for the spin operators ( [ c2 ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) and decomposing it over @xmath339 ( this decomposition can be justified ) we get in the leading approximation over @xmath106 : @xmath340 we can calculate with this hamiltonian the partition function applying the procedure of the @xmath341 construction of the functional integral . in result we get the `` functional integral '' in which in each time section we have an integration over @xmath38 in the limits @xmath342 $ ] and a summation over @xmath184 in the limits @xmath343 $ ] .",
    "we can change summation over @xmath184 on integration over @xmath68 and prolong it to infinty .",
    "after integration over @xmath68 we get the action which coincides with the action ( [ 29 ] ) with one essential difference that instead of @xmath344 in ( [ 29 ] ) we have @xmath345 in ( [ c3 ] ) .",
    "this means that we can get the correct answer for the tunneling splitting @xmath162 ( [ 42a ] ) in the continuous representation @xcite . because we know at present that corrections are small ( see discussion below ) there is one question : why are corrections absent in the approach discussed in this section ?",
    "the explanation lies in the difference between the coherent state construction of the functional integral and the @xmath341 construction .",
    "one can check that at the calculation of the functional determinant in the @xmath341 functional integral the corrections of the order @xmath105 are absent .",
    "these corrections are also absent in the usual problem of tunneling in quantum mechnics which is confirmed by the coincidence of the result of the energy splitting with the quasiclassical one @xcite ) .",
    "we can construct perturbation expansion around of the trivial saddle point ( [ 10 ] ) as well as around of the instanton solution ( [ a32 ] ) .",
    "both these expansions are over very well defined small parameter @xmath106 .",
    "this parameter appears due to the presence of the chracteristic factor @xmath346 in the change of the variables ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ a32 ] ) .",
    "we want to stress that formulation in terms of the functional for the spin coherent states gives the regular procedure for the calculation of corrections .",
    "these corrections are of order @xmath347 for the calculation the ground state enrgy and are of order @xmath106 for calculation of the factor before the exponent in the expression for the instanton splitting .    in conclusion",
    "we want to stress one peculiarity of this perturbation theory : the presence in it of characteristic terms proportional of the number of the time sections @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of such terms is the characteristic feature of the perturbation theory when the measure of the integration is not trivial . in such theories",
    "the kinetic term is also nontrivial : the effective mass or the coefficient before a term with the time derivative is a function of the field variables . at the calculation in the framework of perturbation theory",
    "such terms lead to divergencies at large frequences @xmath170 .",
    "these divergencies have to compleatly canceal @xmath26-terms which follow from the measure .",
