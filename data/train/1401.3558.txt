    "the death of low- and intermediate - mass stars ( 0.88 m@xmath4 ) occurs through stellar mass loss provoked by a pulsation - enhanced , radiation - driven wind .",
    "this process ejects the stellar atmosphere , quenching stellar fusion .",
    "there is a complex interaction between the driving of mass loss and the underlying stellar evolution .",
    "the timing and efficiency of this mass loss can dictate the chemistry and mineralogy of the material returned by the star to the host system .",
    "the integrated effect of this return of matter is therefore important in determining the elemental and molecular abundances , dust - to - gas ratios and mineralogy of the interstellar media of galaxies .",
    "understanding how this process varies throughout universal history is vital for a complete chemical view of the universal elemental enrichment .    despite recent advances ,",
    "it is unclear what determines when and how this wind starts .",
    "it is thought that stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) become unstable to pulsation , probably through the unstable ionisation of hydrogen via the @xmath1-mechanism , which provokes a cepheid - like opacity modulation in the star ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these pulsations become strong enough to levitate atmospheric material , which cools until it can form molecules and then dust .",
    "radiation pressure on these dust grains accelerates them away from the star , and collisional coupling with the surrounding gas means both media are ejected ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "agb stars tend to come in two flavours , depending on the surface ratio of carbon to oxygen .",
    "stars typically begin the agb as oxygen - rich stars , then progressively dredge up carbon from their interiors via a series of thermal pulses , triggered by further instabilities between the hydrogen- and helium - burning shell sources . if the c / o ratio exceeds unity , the star becomes a carbon star .",
    "only certain stars will become carbon - rich , dictated by their initial mass and metallicity ( e.g.  @xcite , their figure 9 , after @xcite ) . for carbon - rich stars , pulsation - enhanced , radiation - driven mass loss appears to be effective at driving a stellar wind , as carbon grains are highly opaque @xcite .    for oxygen - rich stars , particularly those in metal - poor environments ,",
    "opacity - driven winds appear less successful .",
    "the most prevalent form of oxygen - rich dust , iron - poor amorphous silicate , is too transparent at the near - infrared peak of the star s luminosity to drive a wind in this manner @xcite . in metal - poor stars ,",
    "the decreased dust - to - gas ratio means each dust grain must share its momentum with more gas . in dense environments , where the mean free path of dust grains",
    "is too short , this added drag force may prevent the wind from escaping . in tenuous winds , where the mean free path is long ,",
    "the dust can drift ahead of the gas at considerable velocity : the gas can fail to be ejected and fall back , and the dust grains can be destroyed by sputtering in collisions with the gas @xcite .",
    "several possibilities exist for solving the problem of driving metal - poor , oxygen - rich winds .",
    "typical solutions include providing an additional energy input to the wind , or adding opacity to the dust .",
    "the most obvious source for additional energy input is increasing the radial range over which pulsations are an effective accelerant , usually taking advantage of turbulent motions or shocks ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the dust opacity can be increased by changing either the dust species or the grain properties .",
    "high - opacity dust species include amorphous carbon , theoretically allowed via co dissociation but largely unobserved in oxygen - rich environments @xcite , or metallic iron @xcite .",
    "alternatively , larger silicate grains scatter radiation more efficiently @xcite and have been detected @xcite .",
    "all three dust species produce featureless infrared excess , and are thus indistinguishable in infrared spectra .",
    "a complete absence of silicate features in metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 1 dex ; @xcite ) , and a likely change in silicate composition at low metallicity @xcite , suggest some change in dust composition or properties with metallicity exists .",
    "even with the increased opacity of these other dust species , it is not clear that radiation pressure alone can overcome stellar gravity @xcite .    in principle , differentiating between further energy input from pulsation , or ` exotic ' dust production is simple .",
    "if pulsation enhances the wind further , then mass - loss rate should scale with the amount of potential energy stored in the pulsations , which correlates with their amplitude @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rates of otherwise - identical stars at different metallicities should then be similar ( subject to the remaining influence of radiation pressure ) , as should those of carbon- and oxygen - rich stars .",
    "if a different dust species provides opacity and radiation pressure still dominates the energy input , then the stellar wind velocity should scale with stellar luminosity and metallicity .    in practice ,",
    "differentiating the two scenarios is complex , as pulsation energy and luminosity are also correlated .",
    "we must therefore look to see how parameters which are not directly affected by pulsation or luminosity affect the mass - loss rate , such as metallicity , c / o ratio and stellar mass .",
    "the mass - loss rate itself must be examined through proxies such as infrared excess .",
    "our previous analyses of the _ hipparcos _ stellar sample @xcite and globular cluster stars @xcite find mass - losing stars are generally strongly pulsating , confirming the need for stellar pulsations .",
    "however , they lack the range in mass and chemistry required to make concrete statements about the overall role of pulsation in driving the wind .",
    "if pulsation drives the wind , we can expect that infrared excess should correlate with pulsation energy .",
    "if dust drives the wind , we can expect that infrared excess correlates with metallicity and c / o ratio instead .",
    "we herein turn our attention to the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( sgr dsph ) . at 25 kpc @xcite",
    ", it is our closest galactic neighbour .",
    "although being tidally destroyed by the milky way , it retains a sizeable core that extends for several degrees , with its northern extent hidden behind the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "although containing several populations @xcite , its core is strongly dominated by a population with 0.7 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 0.4 dex and an age of 8 @xmath6 1.5 gyr @xcite .",
    "the exception is the globular cluster m54 , which lies on the projected centre of the galaxy and , though metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = 1.7 dex , @xmath7 @xmath8 13 gyr ; @xcite ) , probably acts as the galaxy s core .",
    "we recently showed the bulk population to produce the majority of the sgr dsph s carbon stars , despite its stars only just living long enough to make the carbon - rich transition @xcite .",
    "this work builds on the photometric survey of the sgr dsph at @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) ( published as @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "with this ten - epoch dataset , we explore the variability of stars in the inner regions of the sgr dsph , how it scales with various stellar parameters and with the infrared excess indicative of dust production .",
    "we combine it with our earlier very large telesecope fibre large array multi - element spectrograph ( vlt / flames ) spectroscopic survey ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) to determine differences in variability between carbon- and oxygen - rich stars .",
    "this work exists as part of a larger survey to address the properties of late - stage stellar evolution and mass loss at a range of stellar masses and metallicities ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and complements work by others in environments with mass and metallicity ranges far removed from that of the milky way ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "details of the vista photometric observations can be found in paper ii .",
    "briefly summarised , the observations cover seven tiles , each of which is 1.5 @xmath11 1.0 square degrees , placed on the known over - densities of sgr dsph stars , in an irregular polygon around m54 .",
    "each tile was observed in @xmath0 over either 12 or 13 epochs taken between 2012 april 06 and 2012 august 01 ut . through tile overlaps , a small subset of objects are covered in up to 48 epochs .",
    "tile - by - tile data catalogues were automatically reduced with the vista version 1.2 pipeline at the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu ) .",
    "band and tile merging for the @xmath9- and @xmath10-band data were carried out in paper ii , producing a single set of photometry for each source . in paper ii",
    ", emphasis was placed on creating the most complete colour  magnitude diagram , but this is not optimised for detecting variability .",
    "we re - evaluate the band and tile merging here to place better emphasis on a clean selection of variable stars and extraction of sources that were not detected contemporaneously with the simultaneous @xmath9- and @xmath10-band data .",
    "we begin by concatenating every @xmath0-band detection , retaining its epoch , tile number , magnitude and error . within this dataset ,",
    "we iteratively merge points into the same object if they fall within a certain radius . this radius increases with each iteration , being initially set at 0@xmath12125 , then 0@xmath1225 for the second iteration , 0@xmath12375 for the third , 0@xmath125 for the fourth , and 0@xmath126 for subsequent iterations .",
    "this was found to be necessary to avoid grouping together random points ( e.g. from poorly resolved objects or cosmic rays ) with points from nearby sources .",
    "the largest matching radius is somewhat smaller than the 1@xmath122 used in paper ii to merge the three - colour ( @xmath13 ) catalogue .",
    "we note in that paper that altering the value between 0@xmath125 and 2@xmath120 has little effect on the final @xmath13 catalogue .",
    "however , matches at larger radii tend to be spurious , unrelated detections , either not showing a stellar point - spread function or being related to nearby bright or saturated sources .",
    "a large radius artificially increases the variability of these sources quite dramatically , thus we seek to reduce this effect .",
    "typically around 67 iterations were needed for this process .",
    "the average magnitude of each object and standard deviation of detections from the mean of their parent object were then computed . by this method ,",
    "34517215 @xmath0-band detections were agglomerated into 4267464 objects .",
    "we then followed an iterative procedure to remove zero - point variations between tiles and between epochs .",
    "the average offset between the detection magnitudes and the parent object magnitudes was computed for each epoch  tile combination .",
    "the zero point was adjusted to remove these offsets .",
    "objects were included in this calculation if their parent magnitude was between @xmath14 mag , the standard deviation of their detections was @xmath150.4 mag , and the detection was @xmath151 mag from the parent object s mean .",
    "this process was carried out iteratively , with the last criterion being tightened by 40% on each iteration ( thus @xmath150.6 mag , @xmath150.36 mag , etc . ) .",
    "five iterations were needed to reduce the relative differences in the photometric zero point to under 0.001 mag .",
    "objects were then merged with the @xmath9 and @xmath10 data from paper ii to produce a new three - colour photometric catalogue .",
    "matches were deemed valid if the radius between objects in @xmath0 and in @xmath9+@xmath10 was @xmath150@xmath126 .",
    "some 1981347 @xmath0-band objects were matched with @xmath9- or @xmath10-band detections , of which 1138100 were matched with both .",
    "the baseline of our coverage for individual objects is at least 60 days for most sources , typically 90100 days , and reaching a maximum of 117 days ( figure [ timebasefig ] ) .",
    "the cadence of our observations are of order 10 days , and we can not expect to reliably detect periodic variability on shorter timescales .",
    "this window of 10100 days is longer than rr lyrae or classical cepheid pulsators , but short compared to the expected pulsation periods of high - amplitude long - period variables ( lpvs ) , which cover many months to years ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we do not expect to obtain meaningful periods for most stars , and our data are expected to underestimate the full range in amplitude of many variables .      as with any large catalogue of data , the resulting dataset contained significant quantities of bad data which necessitated the removal of outliers .",
    "for each object , we calculated the median magnitude , and the median deviation of detections from that magnitude .",
    "any detections lying more than 8.5 median deviations from the median were removed . for a normal distribution , this should occur roughly once every 10@xmath16 detections , therefore we expect all these outliers to be bad data .",
    "this simple cut removed most of the bad data from our sample .",
    "objects appearing in only one epoch were also removed , resulting in a fully reduced catalogue of 3777091 objects .    the south - eastern detector on vista suffers from poor data quality .",
    "where stars fall on this detector in one tile and another detector in a different tile , they acquire an artificially high variability , which we wish to mitigate . for sources lying on multiple tiles ,",
    "we compute the standard deviation of magnitudes for each tile . if the standard deviation of any one tile s detections is less than half of that of all detections , the tile with the lowest standard deviation ( provided it has more than one data point ) is taken .",
    "sources with eight or fewer detections were removed from the catalogue , leading to a final catalogue of 2669072 objects .",
    "bright objects in the catalogue also suffer from saturation in the vista data .",
    "figure [ magvarfig ] shows the standard deviation of magnitudes for an object ( @xmath17 ) as a function of the @xmath0-band magnitude of that object .",
    "the increase that can be seen at brighter magnitudes is due to saturated sources , and a hard cutoff of @xmath18 mag would remove these 7400 sources , though they are retained for later investigation .",
    "the vista integration time was set to achieve maximum signal without saturation at the agb tip of the sgr dsph . with one or two exceptions ,",
    "the agb stars in vista do not seem to be affected by saturation .",
    "the remaining objects show typically very good sensitivity to variability ( figure [ magvarfig ] ) .",
    "the median variability of objects between @xmath19 mag is 0.0090 mag , which approximates the scatter in our observations of stars of this magnitude ( corresponding to the majority of the upper giant branches ) .                _",
