    "extra spatial dimensions allow for the possibility of gauge symmetry breaking by the appropriate choice of boundary conditions on the fields .",
    "the relevance of this point to model building was first realized by kawamura  @xcite , in the context of su(5 ) grand unified theories ( guts ) , and was developed substantially afterwards by a number of authors  @xcite . in the simplest case of an @xmath0 orbifold , the matrix representing the action of the @xmath1 symmetry in field space may not commute with all the generators of the gauge symmetry .",
    "boundary conditions may be chosen so that different components of the gauge multiplet have different @xmath1 parities , leaving only some with zero modes after the theory is dimensionally reduced .",
    "the fact that the zero - mode spectrum includes incomplete multiplets of the gauge group indicates that the symmetry has been broken .",
    "although no higgs fields are involved , longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitudes are well behaved at high energies  @xcite . the same approach may be employed to project away the zero - modes  @xcite of the color - triplet higgs in su(5 ) guts , naturally resolving the doublet - triplet splitting problem  @xcite .    in the simplest orbifold constructions , the orbifold parity commutes with the diagonal generators of the original gauge symmetry , so that the unbroken subgroup has the same rank . for symmetry breakings like su(5)@xmath2su(3)@xmath3su(2)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5 ,  @xcite or su(3)@xmath6su(2)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5  @xcite , the breaking by orbifold boundary conditions provides an economical approach for constructing models .",
    "however , larger groups , like @xmath7 or @xmath8 can only be broken directly to the standard model gauge group and , at best , a product of additional u(1 ) factors  @xcite .",
    "one must then rely on the conventional higgs mechanism to complete the breaking of the residual gut symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the use of more general boundary conditions to break such unified symmetries directly to the standard model gauge group , and hence , to reduce the rank of the original group .",
    "this approach has been discussed in the context of higgsless electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite ; here we will employ the same technique at a high scale , while retaining the ordinary higgs mechanism for the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "this choice allows us to eliminate the often complicated and problematic gut - breaking higgs sector , while allowing for the easy generation of light fermion masses .",
    "the unified theory we consider is based on the ` trinified ' gauge group @xmath9su(3)@xmath10su(3)@xmath11su(3)@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the semidirect product ( indicated by the symbol @xmath13 ) provides for a symmetry that cyclically permutes the gauge group labels @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the su(3)@xmath17 representation ( rep ) @xmath18 is part of the trinified rep @xmath19 moreover , the @xmath20 symmetry assures the equality of the three su(3 ) gauge couplings at the gut scale . as originally pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , an appropriate embedding of u(1)@xmath5 in su(3)@xmath11su(3)@xmath21 yields the familiar gut - scale prediction @xmath22 .",
    "we review this construction in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "we will work with a supersymmetric trinified theory in which the @xmath23 gauge multiplet may propagate in a single extra dimensional interval .",
    "we first consider the simplest case in which all the matter and higgs fields are confined to a brane on which @xmath23 is broken . working in an effective theory of gauge - symmetry - breaking ` spurions ' on this brane ,",
    "we establish the boundary conditions necessary to break the bulk gauge group to that of the standard model , @xmath24 .",
    "we also include the couplings of these spurions to the matter multiplets of the theory . in the limit in which the symmetry breaking parameters are taken to infinity",
    ", we obtain the higgsless limit of the gut - breaking sector .",
    "in particular , the mass scale for the heavy gauge multiplets becomes determined by the compactification radius , and all exotic matter fields are decoupled from the theory .",
    "the low - energy theory is simply that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , with a set of massive gauge multiplets at a scale lower than that of conventional supersymmetric unification , @xmath25  gev . we show that unification is nonetheless preserved . above the compactification scale ,",
    "the differential gauge running ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath26 for @xmath27 ) is logarithmic , a feature that has been noted before in the case of su(5 ) guts broken on a boundary  @xcite .",
    "we then show that viable alternative theories exist in which the higgs and/or matter multiplets are allowed to propagate in the bulk space , and we discuss the boundary conditions on these fields . in this case , the exotic matter fields remain part of the theory , but with large masses set by the compactification radius .",

    ": break ] , we give the extra - dimensional construction of supersymmetric su(3)@xmath17 , determine the boundary conditions necessary to break the gauge group down to that of the standard model , and study the higgsless limit of the gut - breaking sector . in section  [ sec : unify ] , we study gauge unification in our minimal model , while in section  [ sec : chiral ] we discuss the possibility of allowing chiral multiplets in the bulk . in section  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our conclusions .",

    "for example , the gauge fields are in the @xmath32-dimensional rep @xmath33 here , @xmath34 represent the eight gluon fields of the standard model , while only some of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 above correspond to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the su(2)@xmath37 gauge group of the standard model is contained entirely in su(3)@xmath38 ; writing @xmath39 , then the su(2)@xmath37 gauge bosons @xmath40 correspond to @xmath41 for @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "the hypercharge gauge boson is a linear combination of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the choice @xmath46 yields the standard gut - scale prediction @xmath47 .",
    "the pattern of gauge symmetry breaking is achieved via one or more higgs fields in the @xmath48-dimensional rep , @xmath49 only the first su(3)@xmath17 factor in this rep allows for color - singlet vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) that may break @xmath50 down to @xmath51 : @xmath52 here , @xmath53 represent the gut - scale vevs , while hatted entries denote components capable of eventually breaking the electroweak gauge group .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking renders twelve of the original gauge bosons with masses of order the gut scale .",
    "interestingly , these massive gauge bosons are integrally charged and can not generate dimension - six operators that contribute to proton decay .",
    "depending on the number of higgs multiplets and their couplings to the matter fields , proton decay may still occur via color - triplet higgs exchange .",
    "standard model fermions are embedded economically in the @xmath48-dimensional representation . in su(5 ) language , the @xmath48 decomposes as @xmath54 \\oplus { \\bf 5 } \\oplus { \\bf \\bar{5 } }   \\oplus { \\bf 1 } \\oplus { \\bf 1 } \\,\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] the reps in brackets correspond to a full standard model generation , while the remaining reps are exotic .",
    "thus the exotic fields include left- and right - handed fermions with the quantum numbers of a charge @xmath55 weak singlet quark ( @xmath56 ) , a hypercharge @xmath57 weak doublet lepton ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) and an electroweak singlet ( @xmath60 ) . using the notation @xmath61 we may choose an su(2)@xmath37 basis in which the fermion reps take the matrix form @xmath62 where all entries are left - handed . in supersymmetric trinification ,",

    "this , however , leads to a symmetry - breaking sector that seems somewhat contrived .",
    "it is conventionally assumed that the vevs @xmath69 and @xmath70 arise in separate higgs * 27 * -plets : @xmath71 the superpotential terms responsible for quark and lepton masses can now be determined from the invariants eq.([eq : quarkmass ] ) and eq.([eq : lepton ] ) , @xmath72\\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath73 \\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } \\,\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] these may be expanded , yielding @xmath74 where the lepton doublets are defined by @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",

    "if we take this completion literally , then we would want to restrict @xmath192 by the condition that the coupling @xmath125 remain perturbative .",
    "however , we are not wedding ourselves to any particular origin for the boundary conditions .",
    "we will take the example just discussed as motivation for the consistency of eq .",
    "( [ eq : morebcs1 ] ) , and work in the exact @xmath196 limit .",
    "the reader who disagrees with this approach may simply consider our results an approximation to the explicit ultraviolet completion discussed above when @xmath192 is taken to be somewhat strongly coupled .    in the case where the bulk @xmath48 s are the three standard model generations",
    ", the exotic @xmath60 , @xmath197 and @xmath56 fields will become massive given our choice of brane spurions .",
    "our results for gauge unification will not be affected since these fields form the complete su(5 ) reps @xmath198 .",
    "another possibility is to place the @xmath48 and @xmath169 higgs multiplets in the bulk . in this case",
    ", we have a tower of kk modes beginning at @xmath199 for the massive components , and a tower beginning at @xmath200 for those components with massless zero modes .",
    "this leads to an additional threshold correction of the type discussed in section  iv .",
    "we find that this tends to spoil unification for values of @xmath112 that are significantly smaller than the conventional supersymmetric unification scale , @xmath201  gev .",
    "thus , this possibility may be realized if @xmath112 and @xmath202 are within a factor of a few of each other so that unification is preserved to good approximation .",
    "the breaking of gauge symmetries through the choice of consistent boundary conditions on an extra dimensional interval provides a powerful new tool for model building . unlike the orbifold case , a more general choice of boundary conditions allows one to reduce the rank of the bulk gauge group . aside from the breaking of electroweak symmetry  @xcite , this approach is naturally of interest in the breaking of grand unified and other gauge extensions of the standard model that have gauge groups with rank greater than four .",
    "we have demonstrated this explicitly in the case of gauge trinification .",
    "we obtained boundary conditions necessary to break the trinified gauge group directly down to that of the standard model , while preserving the gut - scale relation @xmath47 .",
    "symmetry breaking was introduced consistently in terms of spurions localized on the @xmath88 brane . in the higgsless limit , in which these spurions are taken to infinity ,",
    "the massive gauge multiplets have zero - modes at @xmath141 , where @xmath111 is the compactification scale . in the same limit ,",
    "all exotic matter and higgs fields are decoupled from the theory , and higgs - mediated proton decay is avoided .",
    "we retain the light higgs doublets of the mssm , so that light fermion masses may be easily obtained . by placing the gauge multiplets in the bulk",
    ", there is power law running due to the kk modes . as in other 5d unified theories with gauge symmetries broken on a boundary  @xcite",
    ", we find that the running of the differences @xmath203 remains logarithmic .",
    "for the massive gauge fields in our trinified theory , we find that unification is preserved , and that the scale at which the couplings unify is increased . for @xmath159  gev , the gauge couplings unify at the 5d planck mass @xmath162  gev , with a percent accuracy at the one - loop level .    j.c .",
