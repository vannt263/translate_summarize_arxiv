    ", matroids have been successfully applied to diverse fields , such as combinatorial optimization  @xcite , algorithm design  @xcite , information coding  @xcite and cryptology  @xcite .",
    "rough set theory proposed by pawlak  @xcite is a tool to deal with inexact , uncertain and insufficient knowledge in information systems .",
    "it has been successfully applied to pattern recognition , expert system , medical diagnosis , environmental science , biology , biochemistry , chemistry psychology , conflict analysis , economics and process control . however , rough set theory is based on equivalence relations or partitions which are restrictive for many applications . to solve this problem ,",
    "some extensions of rough sets are proposed , such as generalized rough sets base on relations  @xcite , and covering - based rough sets  @xcite .    in order to broaden the theoretical and application areas of rough sets and matroids ,",
    "some researchers have combined them with each other .",
    "for example , wang et al .",
    "@xcite have successfully applied 2-circuit matroids to attribution reduction in classical rough sets . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new type of matroids , namely covering matroids , and study the connections with the second type of covering - based rough sets and some existing special matroids .",
    "first , similar to partition matroids , we introduce a new type of matroids called covering matroids .",

    "second , since in  @xcite partition matroids are successfully used to investigate classical rough sets , we attempt to apply covering matroids to study covering - based rough sets which are an extension of classical rough sets . in this paper , we focus on the second type of covering - based rough sets and obtain the following results . for a covering of a universe and a group of positive integers , a covering block",
    "can be expressed by the rank function and the closure operator of the @xmath0-rank matroid induced by the covering block with respect to the corresponding integer .",
    "the neighborhood of an element of the covering is the intersection of the covering blocks containing the element , then the neighborhood can be represented by @xmath0-rank matroids induced by the covering blocks .",

    "third , since covering matroids are an extension of partition matroids , it is nature to investigate the relationships among covering matroids and some existing special matroids , such as transversal matroids  @xcite , 2-circuit matroids  @xcite and partition - circuit matroids  @xcite .",
    "we prove that a matroid is a transversal matroid , then it is a covering matroid . when a matroid is a partition matroid and a transversal matroid , then it is a 2-circuit matroid . in  @xcite",
