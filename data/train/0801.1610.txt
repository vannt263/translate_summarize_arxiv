    "our numerical procedure enables us to calculate , from @xmath195 , the diffusion constant @xmath20 . in the metallic limit",
    ", @xmath20 agrees with estimation from the transfer matrix .",
    "also , numerical data indicate that @xmath15 is not the self - averaged quantity in the metallic regime",
    ".    it would be interesting to investigate also the scaling behavior of the diffusive constant in the critical regime .",
    "@xcite such analysis could confirm numerical scaling observed recently for the case of the critical disorder at band center .",
    "@xcite however , since only frequencies @xmath196 are relevant in numerical data , we have to analyze much larger system size in order to fit both energies @xmath197 into the narrow critical region .",
    "@xcite    we also present numerical data for the mean values and for probability distributions of the inverse participation ratio .",
    "our data , consistent with previous analytical results , enable us to prove that there are no localized states inside the metallic phase .",
    "all electron states are extended , and the probability to find the state which does not span through the sample decreases exponentially to zero when the size of the system increases .",
    "similarly , no metallic states were observed on the opposite side of the critical point : in the insulating tail of the spectra , all electronic states are localized .",
    "although this result seems to be easily accepted @xcite , it was never proved numerically .",
    "in contrast to the analytical theory , numerical methods do not enable the analysis of the behavior of any quantity in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "we can only describe how the variables of interest change when the size of the system increases . with the use of the finite size scaling hypothesis",
    ", we conclude that our results remain valid also in the limit of @xmath155 .",
    "since all data were obtained without any additional assumption about the averaging procedure or the statistics of parameters of interest , they can serve as a starting point for the construction of the analytical theory of the anderson transition .",
