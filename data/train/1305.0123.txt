    "the layered compound at@xmath0x@xmath0-type family shows versatile physical properties including antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or ferromagnetic ( fm ) order,@xcite fe - based superconductivity@xcite and heavy fermion behavior.@xcite the magnetic properties in this series of compound are very rich .",
    "for example , the parent of recent discovered fe - as based superconductors afe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( a = k , sr , ba and eu ) , @xcite is a collinear antiferromagnetic metal , while ( tl , k , rb and cs)fe@xmath4se@xmath0 with fe - vacancies is a block afm insulator and becomes a superconductor with superconducting temperature @xmath1 30 k with decreasing fe - vacancy levels.@xcite one of a significant common features of fe - based superconductors is that the parent compounds show an antiferromagnetic phase transition at high temperature which can be suppressed by introducing holes or electrons into conducting layers ( feas or fese ) .",
    "furthermore , superconductivity also appears in the ni analogues bani@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite , srni@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite and kni@xmath0se@xmath0,@xcite while ferromagnetism or near the ferromagnetism in co analogues kco@xmath0se@xmath0 @xcite , baco@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite were discovered .",
    "motivated by the versatility of spin fluctuations involved in at@xmath0x@xmath0 structure , we turned out attention to the co - based layered compounds .",
    "aco@xmath0x@xmath0(a = k , rb , cs and tl , x = s and se ) has been investigated previously in polycrystalline by greenblatt s",
    "group.@xcite their results shown that the distance of intralayers or / and interlayers is of vital importance on the electrical and magnetic properties . in this structure",
    "the x - t - x ( t : transition metals ) forms layers , which are built up of edge - sharing tx@xmath5 tetrahedra that extend two dimensionally in the ab - plane .",
    "for example , kco@xmath0se@xmath0 and kco@xmath0s@xmath0 are ferromagnet with @xmath6 of around 80 and 120 k while csco@xmath0se@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures.@xcite tlco@xmath0se@xmath0 is originally thought as a antiferromagnet with @xmath7 @xmath1 90 k. @xcite however , the later neutron results shown that it is a non - collinear helical magnet with zero net spontaneous.@xcite the co atom are ferromagnetically arranged within the ab - plane while the magnetic moment of adjacent co layers are rotated about 121@xmath8 with respect to each other .",
    "@xcite    in this report , we investigated the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization at various temperatures in high quality of single crystals @xmath9co@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a = k , rb and cs ) , grown by self - flux method .",
    "all the samples show metallic luster and metallic conductivity and the ferromagnetic phase transition temperatures are estimated as @xmath1 74 k and 76 k for a = k and rb , respectively .",
    "the susceptibilities obey the modified curie - weiss law in the paramagnetic state quite well .",
    "the derived effective magnetic moments of the co atom from susceptibilities are about 2.21and 2.04 @xmath2/co , and spontaneous moments at the ground state are derived as 0.72 and 0.59 @xmath2/co .",
    "the generalized rhodes - wohlfarth ratios are estimated as 3.07 and 3.42 for a= k and rb , indicating itinerant ferromagnetism in this series .",
    "the magnetic moments align within ab - plane in this series . in case of cs analogue ,",
    "a metamagnetism - like occurs in a field of 3.5 t for @xmath3// ab - plane and the ferromagentic ordering are observed at high magnetic field below 62 k , contrasting to the previous report.@xcite the spin fluctuation effect in this series were discussed within the frameworks of scr and takahashi theory of spin fluctuations .",
    "single crystals of aco@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a = k , rb and cs ) were grown by self - flux method . high purity starting materials k@xmath0se ( obtained by the reaction of k metal and se powder at 573 k for 24 hrs ) k ( lump , 99.9% ) , co ( powder , 99.99% ) and se ( powder 99.999% ) were used in the preparation of the single crystals .",
    "the stoichiometric amounts of starting elements were mixed carefully and sealed in a al@xmath0o@xmath10 tube which was inserted into a quartz tube coated with carbon to avoid the possible reaction with the wall of the quartz tube with the starting materials .",
    "we first slowly heat the quartz tube to 673 k and dwell 5 hrs .",
    "then the furnace heated slowly up to 973 k ( dwell 24h ) and then heated up to 1323 k and keep at this temperature for 12 hours for homogeneity .",
    "finally the furnace slowly cooled to 873 k at a rate of 3 k / h before the furnace was shut down .",
    "a typical size of the obtained single crystal is of @xmath11mm@xmath12 .",
    "the grown samples have golden luster and are very sensitive to the moisture .",
    "therefore , all the above process are done in the ar- filled glove box ( h@xmath0o @xmath13 0.1 ppm and o@xmath0 @xmath13 0.1 ppm ) and the samples are always kept in the glove box except for a very short time in the air during the preparation of magnetic measurements .",
    "the magnetic measurements were performed on quantum design magnetic squid - vsm at hangzhou normal university .",
    "= @xmath14 and reverse magnetic susceptibilities ( @xmath15 ) of the aco@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a= k , rb and cs ) under the magnetic field of 1 t parallel to ab - plane and @xmath16-axis , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines are the best fits by the modified curie - weiss law in high temperature region(100 k@xmath17 300 k ) and the solid line are the data obtained in field cooling ( fc ) process.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath18 ) and reverse magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath15 ) for single crystals aco@xmath0se@xmath0",
    "( a= k , rb and cs ) in an applied magnetic field of 1 t parallel to ab - plane or c - axis , respectively .",
    "firstly , we discuss the @xmath19(t ) for a = k and rb single crystals .",
    "the quick increase of susceptibilities below at about 80 k when further decreasing the temperature is due to the occurrence of a long range of ferromagnetic order and the susceptibilities tend to a saturated value of about 0.4 emu / mol co at low temperatures .",
    "this saturated value is only 15% of that in polycrystal as previous reported,@xcite indicating the high quality of our single crystals . at high temperatures",
    ", @xmath19 can be well fitted by the modified curie - weiss law : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the temperature - independent term , @xmath22 the curie constant , and @xmath23 the paramagnetic curie temperature .",
    "therefore , one can derives parameters in the temperature from 100 k to 300 k for @xmath3//ab - plane or @xmath3// c - axis , respectively and the detail results are listed in table i. the curie constants are nearly independent of samples with the value of around 0.6 emu k / mol , with which one can estimates the effective magnetic moment @xmath24 about 2.4 @xmath2 .",
    "this value is smaller than the theoretical value of 3.87 @xmath2 for a free co@xmath25 ion , suggesting the co ion is of itinerant character .",
    "the curie temperature @xmath23 is almost independent of the samples for @xmath3//ab - plane or @xmath3//c - axis .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath23 derived from the fitting for @xmath3//ab - plane to that of @xmath3//c - axis in single crystals a = k and rb is about 2 and is increased to about10 for csco@xmath0se@xmath0 case .",
    "the positive @xmath23 means a ferromagnetic interaction between the adjacent interlayer co moment or within the same layer is dominant .",
    "a large difference of @xmath23 derived from @xmath3//ab - plane and _ c_-axis indicates that the strength of interaction of co atoms within the layer is stronger than it between the layers . on the other hand",
    ", the susceptibility in csco@xmath0se@xmath0 displays a cusp - like peak around 80 k and seems due to an antiferromagnetic phase transition , which contrasts to the saturated behavior discovered in samples a = k and rb .",
    "this series of samples a= k , rb and cs belong to soft ferromagnet due to no hysteresis ( data not shown ) in @xmath26 ( h ) curve and it is also indicated by the data measured both in fc ( field cooling ) and zfc ( zero field cooling ) processes collapse into one curve .",
    ".magnetic parameters of aco@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a= k , rb and cs).@xmath21 @xmath6 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 are temperature - independent part of @xmath19(emu / mol co ) , curie constant c ( 10@xmath28 emu / mol co k ) , curie temperature @xmath23 ( k ) , spontaneous magnetization at ground state ( @xmath2/co atom ) and effective moment ( @xmath2/co atom ) , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 5 shows @xmath29 dependence of @xmath30 , indicating a good linear relation behavior in a wider range of temperature for crystals of a = k and rb .",
    "such behavior is also discovered in case of csco@xmath0se@xmath31 at high magnetic fields side shown in fig.6 .",
    "therefore , we estimated @xmath6 in this series as 74 k ( k ) , 76 k ( rb ) and 62 k ( cs ) by linear extrapolation at the temperature which passes the origins .",
    "the worse linearity of arrott - plot suggests the existence of sixth - order nonlinear mode - mode coupling among spin fluctuation modes.@xcite in takahashi s theory , the overall linearity of arrott plot is due to a small value of @xmath32 . as a result , very good linearities are observed experimentally in arrott plot curves in ni@xmath10al(@xmath33=0.25)@xcite , sc@xmath10in(@xmath33=0.22),@xcite while a relative larger value of @xmath33 gives worse linearities in arrott plot curves as observed in mnsi ( @xmath33=0.58),@xcite lacoaso(@xmath34)@xcite and fe@xmath10gete@xmath0(@xmath34).@xcite we estimated @xmath33 for our single crystals a = k , rb and cs are 0.64 , 0.64 and 0.57 , respectively by using t@xmath35 and t@xmath36 listed in table ii below .",
    "the spontaneous magnetic moment @xmath37 and the reciprocal initial magnetic susceptibility",
    "@xmath38 (= @xmath39 ) are derived from the linear extrapolation in curves of @xmath29 vs @xmath30 . from the estimated parameters above ,",
    "one can obtained @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these values satisfy the so - called generalized rhodes - wohlfarth relation @xmath42 and deguchi - takahashi plot quite well as shown in fig.7 .",
    "@xcite    furthermore , another important spin - fluctuation parameter @xmath43 also can be derived from arrott - plot which is the coefficient of @xmath29 term of the landau expansion of free energy and usually expressed in kelvin unit as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are avogadro s number and boltzmann constant , respectively , and @xmath47 is the slope of arrott plot at @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 can be determined uniquely from the slope of the arrott - plot at @xmath6 .",
    "although the curves of the arrott - plot ( @xmath48 vs @xmath30 ) do nt have a perfect linearity , it is reasonable to estimate the gradient at the temperatures of @xmath6 in a narrower high magnetic field region .",
    "we estimated @xmath43 from a high field region of @xmath48 vs @xmath30 curve at @xmath6 . in takahashi s theory , @xmath49 , and hence gives the relations below : @xmath50 @xmath51 where the values of the integral constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 are 1.006 and 0.50 , respectively and @xmath54 the spontaneous magnetic moment at ground state .",
    "the detailed spin fluctuation parameters are listed in table ii .",
    "using the spin fluctuation and thermal dynamic parameters , one can calculated the @xmath38 in a paramagnetic state by the scr theory as @xmath55),\\ ] ] with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58,@xmath59 , @xmath60 , c = 0.3353 , where @xmath61 is the digamma function , @xmath62 and @xmath63 the intra - atomic exchange energy .",
    "therefore the calculated temperature dependence of the inverse magnetic susceptibilities for samples of a = k , rb and cs by using the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 obtained from the experiment on eq.(6 ) are shown in solid lines in fig.8 .",
    "the solid lines show clear deviations at high temperatures but agree well with the experimental data at low temperatures .",
    "if we allow the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be changeable we can obtain the best fits to each sample as shown by dashed lines in the insets of fig .",
    "8 . as a result ,",
    "the parameters of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are a little larger than the values obtained from the arrott - plots , however , in the same order of magnitude . in scr and takahashi s theory , the squared spontaneous moment @xmath71 and the initial susceptibility @xmath72 have relation of @xmath73 near the @xmath6 as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "very near @xmath6 , the coefficients of @xmath73 is given as @xmath74 = 1.27.@xcite we obtained the coefficients of @xmath73 for a= k , rb and cs are 1.27 , 1.31 and 1.03 , respectively by fitting the data near @xmath6 .",
    "the results satisfied the theory very well except for the cs case which is possible due to its very narrow @xmath73 temperature region . in takahashi s theory , @xmath75-dependence of the squared spontaneous moment at low temperatures is described in terms of @xmath65 by neglecting the spin - wave contribution at low temperatures and obeys the formula : @xcite @xmath76 ^ 2=1-\\frac{50.4}{m_0(0)^4 } ( \\frac{t}{t_a})^2.\\ ] ] a good linearity is shown in curves of @xmath77 ^ 2 $ ] against t@xmath78 at low temperatures as displayed in fig.9 . as results , the fitting by using formula ( 7 ) gives the values of @xmath65 are 1193 , 1900 and 1828 k for samples of a = k , rb and cs , respectively .",
    "these values are very close to those derived from @xmath66 .    the parameters of @xmath64 and @xmath65 derived from the arrott - plots or the initial magnetic susceptibility calculated on the scr and takahashi s theory are comparable with each other .",
    "similar results were reported in lacoaso system .",
    "@xcite it strongly indicates that the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in co analogues related to the new discovered fe - based superconductors can be understood within the frameworks of scr and takahashi s theory .",
    "the study of spin fluctuations in aco@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a= k , rb and cs ) could give more information to shed light on the nature of superconductivity on fe - based superconductors .",
    "in summary , we investigated the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization for the single crystals aco@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a= k , rb and cs ) , which were grown by self - flux method .",
    "a ferromagnetic transition occurs at @xmath1 74 k and 76 k for a= k and rb",
    ". a metamagnetism - like occurs at about 3.5 t for @xmath3// c - axis in csco@xmath0se@xmath0 below 62 k , and a cusp - like occurs at @xmath1 80 k in susceptibility .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility obeys the modified curie - weiss law in the paramagnetic state quite well .",
    "the arrott - plots show linear behavior at low temperatures and nonlinear behavior in high temperatures .",
    "a good linear relation is realized in the curves of @xmath29 vs @xmath30 in a quite broaden temperature region , which is supported by a large @xmath33 in takahashi s theory .",
    "the estimated spontaneous magnetic moments at zero temperature are 0.72 , 0.58 and 0.52@xmath2 for a = k , rb and cs ( in high magnetic state ) , respectively .",
    "the according generalized rhodes - wohlfarth ratio are 3.07 , 3.46 and 3.92 , indicating a moderate itinerant ferromagnetism in this system . the spin fluctuation in this system",
    "can be understood in the frameworks of scr and takahashi s theory of spin fluctuations .",
