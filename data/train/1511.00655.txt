    "the discovery , in 1998 , that the universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion is one of the greatest milestones in all physics .",
    "naturally , over the last 17 years , many proposals to explain this evolution have been brought forward .",
    "most ideas involve scalar field dark energy or extensions of einstein s gravity . these proposals",
    "are essentially phenomenological without any relation to each other .",
    "one major step forward was the realization in 2011 that all these proposals are subclasses of the most general scalar - tensor theory that leads to second order equations of motion , the horndeski lagrangian .",
    "@xcite    seeking viable cosmological solutions , one can focus on the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker spacetime and search for cosmological models that have a late time flat de sitter critical point for any kind of material content or value of the vacuum energy .",
    "such models were attained @xcite and in this proceedings we address their phenomenology following recent work .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that it is possible to construct a scalar field lagrangian , @xmath0 linear in @xmath1 , such that : ( i ) the field equation for the hubble rate , @xmath2 , is trivially satisfied at the critical point to allow the field to self - adjust ; ( ii ) at the critical point , the hamiltonian depends on @xmath3 , so that the continuous field can absorb discontinuities of the vacuum energy and ; ( iii ) the scalar field equation of motion depends on @xmath4 , such that the cosmological evolution is non - trivial before screening takes place . considering minimally coupled matter , the linear lagrangian becomes @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 , subject to the constraint , @xmath8 which ensures that the lagrangian density evaluated at the critical point has the form required to allow the field to self - tune . in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) we have written explicitily an einstein  hilbert term contained in @xmath9 . the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to the @xmath12 functions of the horndeski lagrangian and @xmath13 functions of the deffayet _",
    "et al . _",
    ". as there are a total of eight functions and only one constraint , there are effectively only seven free functions which we coined `` the magnificent seven''.@xcite the field equation for @xmath14 and the friedmann equation read , @xmath15 where a prime represents derivative with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "we are now going to consider a number of cases in our search for viable cosmological models compatible with current observations .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in this case @xmath14 is ill defined .",
    "this can be understood by inspecting the hamiltonian @xmath19h^i \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i } \\left[3(i-1)\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,u_i(\\phi)\\right ] h^i , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that it is independent of @xmath3 , therefore violating condition ( ii ) for a successful lagrangian .",
    "this means that the model does not screen dynamically and only the de sitter solution exists .      from the constraint equation",
    "we have that @xmath21 , and then @xmath22 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] which does not depend on @xmath23 and , consequently , the matter content has no influence on the universe s evolution .",
    "when @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we can approximate the field equation by @xmath26 we can , however , obtain a dust like behaviour for @xmath27 and , as we expected by construction , we reach a de sitter evolution when @xmath28 .      in this case , from the constraint equation , @xmath30 and then @xmath31 which is again independent of @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath32 and @xmath25 , the field equation reads , @xmath33 and we recover dust for @xmath34 .",
    "a de sitter universe is reached when @xmath28 .",
    "we now consider that the constraint equation is satisfied for equal powers of @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "we have then eight functions and four constraints , hence , only four free potentials . defining @xmath37",
    ", we can write , @xmath38 here the field ( and the background matter ) contributes to the dynamics of the universe as there is a dependence on @xmath23 , which is determined by the matter content via eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . for @xmath39 and when only one @xmath40 component dominates @xmath41 which means that we recover dust for @xmath27 . as before ,",
    "we reach de sitter when @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider the three potentials @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the constraint equation imposes @xmath45 , and then @xmath46 for @xmath39 , @xmath47 therefore we need : @xmath48 , during a matter domination epoch , and @xmath49 , for a radiation domination epoch .",
    "for example , the choice of the potentials , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , give us the desired behaviour , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tripod1 ] .",
    "the de sitter evolution is attained when @xmath28 .",
    "unfortunately , the contribution of the field at early times is too large to satisfy current constraints .",
    "in this section we consider the non - linear terms in @xmath3 in the lagrangian , i.e. , @xmath52 provided that any non - linear dependence of the lagrangian on @xmath1 vanishes at the critical point , thus , @xmath53 , and combine it with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "again , @xmath56 are related to the the @xmath12 functions of the horndeski lagrangian and @xmath13 functions of the deffayet",
    "_ et al . _",
    "we will restrict the analysis to the shift - symmetric cases , which means no dependence on @xmath23 , and make use of the convenient redefinition @xmath57 . under these assumptions",
    "we obtain the equations of motion , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , are complicated functions of @xmath56 and @xmath65 , and the average equation of state parameter of matter fluids is @xmath66 as for the linear models , we are now going to take a systematic evaluation of the possible cosmological scenarios .      when @xmath68 is the dominant potential and @xmath69 , then the effective equation of state is @xmath70 neither of these allow for @xmath71 corresponding to a radiation and/or matter domination epochs .",
    "if instead @xmath73 is the dominant potential , for @xmath69 , it follows that @xmath74 in this case , either @xmath71 is too small today when compared with observational limits or , @xmath75 is too large in the early universe .",
    "if we take @xmath76 and @xmath77 to be the only non - negligeble potentials , then it can be shown that when @xmath69 , the equation of state parameter @xmath78 .",
    "this represents an interesting case but , unfortunately , models with realistic initial conditions are not driven to the critical point .",
    "finally we consider a case involving the three potentials @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath73 such that @xmath79 we can obtain a model with @xmath80 , such that , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which is compatible with current limits and moreover , has a negligible dark energy contribution at early times . the evolution of the energy densities is illustrated in fig .",

    "in this article we have consider horndeski cosmological models that may alleviate the cosmological constant problem by screening any value of the vacuum energy given by the theory of particle physics .",
    "we have presented the linear and the non - linear models and shown that the class of non - linear models with shift symmetry are in a better footing when they are compared with current observational constraints of the effective equation of state parameter and limits on early dark energy contribution . in order to further scrutinise these models , we are now required to face them against observables that depend on the evolution of the field and matter fluid fluctuations .",
