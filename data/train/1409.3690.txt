    "recent years have seen growing interest in composite likelihood methods , due to their computational advantages in estimating parameters of very complex statistical models : see @xcite for an overview .",
    "a key feature of these methods is their ability to avoid the calculation of the normalizing constant of the model , which will typically depend on the parameter .",
    "determination of this constant , essential for full likelihood - based inference , can be a very challenging task , entailing multidimensional integration of the full joint density .",
    "composite likelihood approaches can avoid this , by maximizing the product of low - dimensional marginal or conditional likelihoods .",
    "the most used composite likelihood in applications is the pairwise likelihood @xcite , defined as the product of bivariate marginal densities .",
    "composite likelihood estimation methods form a subset of a more general class of methods based on _ proper scoring rules _ , estimation being conducted by minimising the empirical score over distributions in the model @xcite .",
    "some important proper scoring rules are the log - score , @xmath0 @xcite , which recovers the full ( negative log ) likelihood , and the brier score @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting special case , which entirely avoids the need to compute the normalizing constant , is the _ score matching _",
    "method of @xcite , which is based on minimizing the following objective function : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density function of a distribution @xmath3 proposed for a random variable @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the realized value of @xmath5 . in",
    ", @xmath6 denotes the gradient operator , and @xmath7 the laplacian operator , with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "this assumes that the random variable @xmath4 is continuous - valued and defined over the entire @xmath8 supplied with the standard norm @xmath9 , and that @xmath10 is differentiable over @xmath8 .",
    "the score matching technique was subsequently generalised to the case of a riemannian manifold @xcite , to the case of a non - negative real domain @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and for binary variables @xcite .",
    "the objective function in , the `` hyvrinen scoring rule '' , is a _",
    "2-local homogeneous proper scoring rule _ : see @xcite .",
    "inference performed using any homogeneous scoring rule does not require the knowledge of the normalizing constant of the distribution , since the value of the score is unaffected by applying a positive scale factor to the density @xmath10 .",
    "works considering estimation based on the hyvrinen score include @xcite . in a full natural exponential family , score matching delivers a linear estimating equation , which could be used as a starting point of iterative methods as in the r package grc for gaussian graphical model with symmetries @xcite .",
    "the principal concern of this work is to investigate and compare the behaviours of the estimators obtained from the hyvrinen score , the pairwise likelihood , and the full likelihood .",
    "we confine our attention to two different model settings : autoregressive and moving average processes .",
    "the loss in efficiency in using pairwise likelihood methods may be slight in the former case , or very large , in the latter @xcite .",
    "+ the paper unfolds as follows .",
    "section  2 introduces basic notions on scoring rules .",
    "section  3 describes estimation procedures for first order autoregressive and moving average processes .",
    "section  4 summarizes the results of the simulation studies conducted .",
    "we conclude in section  5 .",
    "a _ scoring rule _ is a loss function designed to measure the quality of a proposed probability distribution @xmath3 , for a random variable @xmath4 taking values in @xmath13 , in view of the outcome @xmath5 of @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , if a forecaster quotes a predictive distribution @xmath3 for @xmath4 and the event @xmath14 realizes , then the loss will be @xmath15 .",
    "the expected value of @xmath16 when @xmath4 has distribution @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the scoring rule @xmath19 is _ proper _ ( relative to the class of distributions @xmath20 ) if @xmath21 it is _ strictly proper _ if equality in obtains only when @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be independent realizations of a random variable @xmath4 , having distribution @xmath24 depending on an unkown parameter @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an open subset of @xmath8 .",
    "given a proper scoring rule @xmath19 , let @xmath27 denote @xmath28 .",
    "inference for the parameter @xmath29 may be performed by minimising the _ total empirical score _ , @xmath30 resulting in the _ minimum score estimator _ , @xmath31 under broad regularity conditions on the model ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , @xmath32 is a root of the _ score equation _ : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the gradient vector of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath29 : @xmath36 .",
    "the score equation is an unbiased estimating equation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath19 is the log - score , the minimum score estimator coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator .    from the general theory of unbiased estimating functions , under broad regularity conditions on the model",

    "it is possible to define test statistics , analogous to those based on the full likelihood , starting from an arbitrary proper scoring rules : _ e.g. _ scoring rule wald - type , scoring rule score - type and scoring rule ratio statistics @xcite",
    ".      estimation of the matrix @xmath44 , and ( to a somewhat lesser extent ) of the matrix @xmath45 , is not an easy task . here , we review the methods we use to estimate these two matrices in the simulation studies . + let @xmath46 be independent observations from a @xmath47-dimensional distribution @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath48 is quite large , empirical estimation of the two matrices could be done as @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "+ when it is possible to simulate directly from the complete model , the two matrices could be estimated by recovering to their monte carlo estimates , i.e.@xmath51 where @xmath52 are @xmath53 independent realizations from the model obtained by assuming @xmath32 as the true parameter value .",
    "+ we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a detailed account on the estimation of the two matrices under the composite likelihood setting .",
    "@xcite compare the performances of the composite likelihood based statistics ( wald - type , score - type , and some adjustments of the composite likelihood ratio ) obtained by estimating @xmath43 and @xmath42 empirically with the ones produced by using monte carlo simulation of the two matrices .",
    "this section will be devoted to two examples both dealing with multivariate normal distributions : the first order autoregressive and moving average models which are two simple examples of linear time series models .",
    "they are chosen so that we can calculate both the full and pairwise likelihood estimators .",

    "+ it should be pointed out that this approach can not be used if we have a single time series of length @xmath47 with @xmath47 increasing to @xmath143 , since for non - singularity of the wishart distribution we need to assume @xmath118 .",

    "; in contrast , in the second example this method leads to poor estimators .",
    "the opposite behaviour is observed for the univariate and multivariate hyvrinen estimators . for the moving average process",
    ", there can be a large gain in efficiency , as compared to the pairwise likelihood method , by using the univariate or multivariate hyvrinen score .",
    "for the autoregressive model , in contrast , the hyvrinen score methods suffer a loss of efficiency as @xmath162 approaches @xmath54 . in both examples , a great improvement in the performances of the minimum hyvrinen score based on the wishart model",
    "is observed as the ratio @xmath168 becomes negligible .",
    "it is known that the algorithm used to generate a wishart random matrix as the sum - of - squares - and - products matrix of independent multivariate normals is not efficient ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pag.150 ) ) .",
    "a question which arises is whether the inefficiency of this algorithm might be affecting the observed behaviour of the multivariate hyvrinen score .",
    "however , results not shown here reveal that no big improvement arises if we generate directly from the wishart distribution , using for example the ` rwish ` function of the ` mcmcpack ` package , which use the bartlett s decomposition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the loss of efficiency incurred in using the hyvrinen scoring rule or pairwise likelihood can be quite substantial , but this depends on the underlying model .",
    "the multivariate hyvrinen estimator has the apparent advantage over the other estimators ( apart from full maximum likelihood ) of being based on the sufficient statistic of the model ; nevertheless the univariate hyvrinen methods shows good performance in terms both of standard errors and efficiency .",
    "the hyvrinen scoring rule methods may represent viable alternatives to the pairwise log - likelihood approach for inference in high - dimensional models where the computation of the normalizing constant is not feasible and the pairwise likelihood leads to poor estimators .",
    "in particular , the multivariate hyvrinen scoring rule may be convenient for studies in which a large number of models with the same parameter should be estimated .",
    "it would be of interest to analyse the performance of the univariate and the multivariate hyvrinen scoring rule estimators both when nuisance parameters are present and when interest focus on the complete vector of parameters .",
