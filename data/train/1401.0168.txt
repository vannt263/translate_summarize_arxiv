    "the estimates for validation stations are only slightly more variable .",
    "overall , the extremal dependence for validation data is adequately represented by the model .    using the conditional distribution  , we considered simulation at the @xmath335 validation stations conditional on the values observed at the other stations when at least one of the @xmath324 components exceeded its marginal @xmath310 threshold . to compare the observed extreme values at the @xmath335 validation locations with those predicted by the model , we simulated @xmath336 conditional realisations for each day , and we measured the proportion of true values falling between the @xmath337 and @xmath338 quantiles of the simulations . over the @xmath335 locations and the @xmath339 days with at least one exceedance at the other @xmath324 locations , approximately @xmath340 of the observed values were in the @xmath310 simulated intervals .",
    "we do not attain @xmath310 corresponding to a perfect prediction , which can at least partly be explained by the fact that the simulations used conditional data below the thresholds and also ignored the uncertainty of the estimates of the fitted model ; simulations taking these two aspects into account should be more variable and thus have a higher coverage probability .",
    "finally , we illustrate the ability of the pareto process approach to easily simulate conditional rainfall given observed extremes at some set of locations . for a particular day and",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the mean of these simulated rainfall fields and the right panel its standard deviation .",
    "pareto models are appealing because they generalize peaks - over - threshold stability to the spatial context and they appropriately exploit the regularity of the exponent measure in pseudo - polar coordinates for extrapolation on extremes . in this paper",
    "we have introduced inference and simulation procedures for the elliptical pareto model .",
    "numerical results suggest that the censored approach based on marginal thresholds gives more reliable estimates for this process , but the choice of a sufficiently high threshold is crucial to guarantee that the limiting model provides an adequate approximation to the tail of the data .",
    "the pairwise likelihood method was found to be more robust to model misspecification .",
    "we modelled rainfall extremes using a two - step approach that combines a latent variable model for the margins with the fit of an elliptical pareto process .",
    "the bayesian approach enables the modelling of complex spatial trends in univariate marginal distributions and provides a more flexible alternative to regression models .",
    "ideally we would like to use a full bayesian model based on generalized elliptical pareto processes , but it is prone to computational difficulties . in our application ,",
    "one evaluation of the censored likelihood function takes several minutes , preventing the use of this likelihood in markov chain monte carlo algorithms .",
    "the distribution of an elliptical pareto process is fully specified by its exponent measure @xmath72 which depends on a correlation function and a shape parameter . in practice ,",
    "data are observed on a finite set of sites @xmath145 , so inference focuses on the estimation of the finite - dimensional exponent measure @xmath156 , based on the choice of a risk functional that can be evaluated at @xmath145 .",
    "estimation is based on finite - dimensional distributions from which parameters can be identified , which induces the unique dependence structure on @xmath341 .",
    "it thus enables projection of extremes on @xmath341 , eventually using different risk functionals than those used for the estimation .",
    "the properties of the maximum likelihood estimators for elliptical @xmath0-pareto processes under the limiting model are well - known but further work to investigate the theoretical properties of such estimators under domain of attraction assumptions would be valuable .",
