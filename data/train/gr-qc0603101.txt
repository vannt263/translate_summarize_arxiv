    "the coupling of general relativity to yang - mills @xmath1 non - abelian theories was studied in detail in the 1990s giving rise to a fuller understanding of the systems involved through a series of remarkable results .",
    "this effort started after the paper by bartnick and mckinnon @xcite , which showed that einstein@xmath0yang - mills theory has one particle solution , the bartnick - mckinnon particle , in spite of neither pure gravity nor pure yang - mills having a particle solution on their own .",
    "further studies inserted a black hole inside this particle @xcite with the conclusion that , although unstable , the solution could be an instance of no - hair violation , which in turn motivated new works .",
    "similar systems were then studied , such as , the einstein - skyrme system @xcite , the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0dilaton system @xcite , the yang - mills@xmath0proca system @xcite , the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs sphaleron system @xcite , einstein@xmath0yang - mills in anti - de sitter spacetimes @xcite , all these systems have in common that their global electromagnetic type charge is zero , a good review is in @xcite .",
    "there is yet another very interesting system , which concerns us here , the magnetic monopole which is a solution of the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs system .",
    "indeed , the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole , is a solution of the pure yang - mills@xmath0higgs system ( i.e. , einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs with zero gravity ) , when the yang - mills and the higgs fields are in the adjoint @xmath2 representation ( see the review paper of goddard and olive @xcite ) . the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole , at large distances , has the same structure of the dirac monopole , however the core is non - singular @xcite .",
    "when one couples gravitation , at least weakly , the magnetic monopole solution is still there , as was noticed in @xcite , now exerting a small gravitational attraction . for strong gravitational fields",
    "the system was studied much later , in the wake of the bartnick - mckinnon particle , notably by ortiz @xcite , lee , nair and weinberg @xcite , breitenlohner , forgcs and maison @xcite , and aichelburg and bizon @xcite , among others .",
    "a distinctive feature of this system is that it has a global magnetic charge , which of course influences the properties of the spacetime .",
    "in addition , the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs system has two lengthscales , one due to the mass of the w particle ( the yang - mills particle that has eaten some mass in the symmetry breaking process ) , the other due to the mass of the higgs .",
    "for low higgs mass , the associated large compton length scale does not interfere much , and the structure of the monopole is characterized in great extent by the w field features . for this system , the one analyzed in @xcite , it was found that there are regular solutions , and moreover , for a sufficiently massive monopole the system turns into an extremal quasi - black hole , developing an extremal quasi - horizon , with all the non - trivial matter fields inside it .",
    "a quasi - black hole is a configuration which is non - singular but on the verge of having a horizon at some radius @xmath3 .",
    "more specifically , quasi - black holes are non - singular solutions arbitrarily close to having a horizon . for an external observer",
    "it becomes increasingly difficult distinguish a quasi - black hole from a true black hole as a critical solution is approached . at the critical value one has to distinguish two situations .",
    "in the low higgs mass situation a horizon never forms , when the configuration has radius @xmath3 the spacetime is degenerated , where the time dimension disappears altogether from a region of the spacetime .",
    "the distinction between a quasi - black hole and a true black hole , as well as the appearance of a degenerated spacetime , was not clear in the early works .",
    "on the other hand , for high higgs mass the system behaves differently as was shown later by lue and weinberg @xcite ( see also the review ( @xcite ) . in this case , for a sufficiently massive monopole the system turns into a quasi - black hole , and at the critical value , a real extremal magnetic reissner - nordstrm black hole appears , developing a true extremal horizon inside the monopole core , and moreover , non - abelian matter fields stick out of the horizon , in gross violation of the no - hair conjecture .",
    "it was further found that one could insert a schwarzschild black hole inside the monopole without perturbing much its structure , forming a non - abelian black hole .",
    "but when the radius of the schwarzschild black hole achieved a certain value the horizon would jump into another extremal quasi - horizon .",
    "this happens both in the low higgs mass case , as was found by the original authors , as well as in the high higgs mass case , as was shown by brihaye , hartmann and kunzin @xcite where the continuation of the original program has been carried out .",
    "other studies connected with magnetic monopoles in the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs theory can be mentioned : ( i ) the thermodynamical properties of these monopole black holes were further studied by maeda et al @xcite in the low higgs mass case , and by lue and weinberg @xcite for high higgs mass ; ( ii ) ridgeway and weinberg found the existence of non - spherically symmetric magnetic monopole configurations @xcite ; ( iii ) dyonic solutions were found by brihaye et al @xcite ; ( iv ) monopole solutions in other theories were found , like in a brans - dicke theory @xcite , and in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "now , in a different context , the study of the einstein - maxwell system goes back to the origins of general relativity where reissner in 1916 and nordstrm in 1918 found the reissner - nordstrm solution ( see @xcite for the appropriate references ) , and weyl studied axisymmetric gravito - electric vacuum systems in four dimensions @xcite . a great development occurred in 1947 when majumdar @xcite and papapetrou @xcite , drawing upon weyl s results , found new four - dimensional solutions that represent many particles ( from one to infinity ) , each particle with mass equal to charge , located at any desired position , without spatial symmetry in the most generic case ( see @xcite for a generalization of majumdar s @xcite and papapetrou s @xcite works to higher dimensional ( @xmath7 ) spacetimes ) .",
    "the idea is borrowed from newtonian gravitation : a particle with mass equal to charge is in equilibrium with other mass equal to charge particle , and so with many other such particles , since the gravitational attraction is balanced by the electric repulsion .",
    "the majumdar - papapetrou solutions are the general relativistic realization of this idea .",
    "now , in newtonian theory , point particles are point particles , but in general relativity they can be black holes .",
    "this was clarified by hartle and hawking @xcite who showed that the vacuum solution represent extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes at any spatial position .",
    "a different development was taken by das @xcite , who relying on the work of majumdar @xcite , put dust particles on the point particles positions , evading the black hole horizons .",
    "several other authors have further analyzed the properties of majumdar - papapetrou systems @xcite .",
    "bonnor and collaborators @xcite in a series of papers have shown and studied important new solutions of majumdar - papapetrou equations and properties of the system .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , spherical extremal matter stars ( where extremal matter stars are defined as stars composed of matter with charge density equal to the energy density ) , with an exterior extremal reissner - nordstrm metric , were found .",
    "these are the bonnor stars .",
    "bonnor stars were further developed by lemos and weinberg @xcite where new explicit solutions were found .",
    "it was also found that these new stars , as well as bonnor stars , develop a quasi - black hole behavior , and there are cases that the solution can even display some kind of hair @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite a thick shell solution was found . in the limit of zero interior radius for this thick shell ,",
    "the solution is a bonnor star , in the limit of the thickness going to zero , the solution is a thin shell .",
    "these solutions also have quasi - black hole behavior .    here",
    "we want to explore further the analogy between gravitational magnetic monopoles and majumdar - papapetrou stars . in the previous papers @xcite ,",
    "the majumdar - papapetrou solutions found , although complex , did not exhibit the full behavior of the gravitational magnetic monopoles , where there is an interplay between the w - field scale and the higgs field scale .",
    "we construct here a majumdar - papapetrou system which shows such a full behavior .",
    "such a system is composed of two infinitesimally thin shells .",
    "majumdar - papapetrou thin shells have many interesting properties .",
    "let us think first of one thin shell to simplify .",
    "we will call it the star , it is a regular solution .",
    "fix the mass of the star , and study the set of formed configurations as one decreases its radius . for a sufficiently small radius the star develops an extremal reissner - nordstrm quasi - black hole .",
    "the same happens if instead one fixes the radius and increases the mass .",
    "one can go further and put another thin shell inside the thin shell star .",
    "one can then ask , when the radii of the system are decreased which shell is going to form a quasi - horizon first ?",
    "the usual case is the outer shell developing a quasi - horizon first , the whole system being inside the quasi - black hole .",
    "but , depending on the parameters and constraints , the inner shell can develop a quasi - horizon first , in which case we have an extremal quasi - black hole in the core of the system , with star matter floating outside .",
    "one can also put an extremal reissner - nordstrm true black hole inside the regular star ( as was done in the gravitational magnetic monopole case , when one puts a small schwarzschild black hole inside the magnetic monopole ) and then increase the black hole radius through a set of configurations . at a certain point the whole system jumps into a new extremal reissner - nordstrm quasi - black hole .",
    "if we exchange star for monopole , the properties of this majumdar - papapetrou system are identical to the properties of the gravitational magnetic monopole system .",
    "all these similarities with the gravitational magnetic monopole will be explored in this paper . a similarity which we do not explore , is that both systems permit non - spherically symmetric solutions , in the magnetic monopole case see @xcite , in the majumdar - papapetrou case see @xcite .",
    "we note that the majumdar - papapetrou solutions , such as the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions and the bonnor stars , are also of interest in extensions of general relativity , since the system turns out to be supersymmetric when embedded in a larger theory , such as @xmath8 gauged supergravity ( see @xcite for a review of majumdar - papapetrou solutions in supergravity and string theories ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we overview the properties of gravitational magnetic monopoles that most interest us , we give the equations and define the important scales , we review the low higss field ( low @xmath9 ) case without , and then with , an interior schwarzschild black hole , and review also the high @xmath9 case . in section iii we study the properties of the majumdar - papapetrou two shell system : we give the equations and length scales , assume some constraints for the shells and present the solution , study the equivalent low @xmath9 behavior without and with an interior extremal reissner - nordstrm true black hole , and then the equivalent high @xmath9 behavior . a remark",
    ": when we write a black hole it means a true extremal reissner - nordstm black hole , when we write a quasi - black hole it means solutions of matter configurations that are on the verge of being a black hole . in some instances ,",
    "quasi - black holes turn into degenerated spacetimes @xcite , in other instances turn into real black holes @xcite .",
    "in this section we overview the solutions for gravitational magnetic monopoles .",
    "the logical presentation of the material reflects in a unified way the work of the authors on this subject and is suited for comparison with the subsequent analysis on majumdar - papapetrou stars .",
    "the action of the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs theory is @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the scalar curvature , and @xmath13 is the yang - mills@xmath0higgs lagrangian given by @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gauge coupling constant , @xmath18 the higgs coupling constant , and @xmath19 the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "the yang - mills connection @xmath20 and the higgs field @xmath21 take values on the lie algebra of the @xmath1 group , with @xmath22 being an internal index .",
    "the potential @xmath23 in the matter lagrangian has a family of gauge - equivalent minimums , given by @xmath24 , which breaks spontaneously the @xmath1 symmetry down to @xmath25 .",
    "one can choose the vacuum to be in the third internal direction @xmath26 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the elementary particles of the theory are the electromagnetic @xmath25 massless gauge field ( a photon ) , two massive w particles with charge @xmath27 and mass @xmath28 , and the neutral massive field @xmath29 with mass @xmath30 .",
    "there is also the massless graviton .",
    "the monopole configuration is spherically symmetric with metric written generically in terms of two functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xmath33 with a magnetic yang - mills field , written in terms of one function @xmath34 , as @xmath35 and a higgs field , written in terms of one function @xmath36 , as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the levi - civita tensor , and @xmath39 is the unit vector in the radial direction . putting this ansatz into the einstein@xmath0yang - mills@xmath0higgs action and varying the action with relation to the four functions yields four equations , two for the gravitational fields @xmath32 and @xmath31 , one for the yang - mills field @xmath34 , and one for the higgs field @xmath36 .",

    "there are four parameters in the theory : @xmath45 ( which we have set equal to one ) , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . with these parameters",
    "one can form two dimensionless parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since @xmath19 is dimensionless , it is already a sought parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "the other dimensionless parameter is @xmath49 .",
    "( in passing , note that in these studies of gravitational magnetic monopoles , @xmath45 is not usually set to one , but rather @xmath50 @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the planck mass and the planck length , respectively .",
    "here we are putting @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. , we are measuring everything in terms of these scales .",
    "it is straightforward to move from one system of units to the other : every time one finds a mass one should divide by @xmath56 , every time one finds a length one should divide by @xmath57 , in the end collect all @xmath56s and @xmath57s , transform @xmath57 into @xmath56 by @xmath58 , and put back @xmath45 from @xmath59 ) .",
    "the magnetic monopole solution can be characterized by its mass and radius , and by a secondary mass and a secondary radius . to understand the effects of gravity it is useful to rewrite the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , defined above , in terms of two renewed parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath9 , defined through the characteristic masses and radii themselves .",
    "indeed , for a weak gravitational field the magnetic charge of the monopole is @xmath61 , its radius is given roughly by the compton wavelength of the yang - mills field , @xmath62 , and its mass by the magnetic energy @xmath63 .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath46 given above ( @xmath48 ) , we can define a parameter @xmath60 ( with @xmath64 ) as @xmath65 which is a useful characterization when we turn on gravitation , and for later comparison .",
    "the other parameter @xmath9 can also be written in similar terms : since there is the higgs mass scale , the monopole solution has secondary mass and radius scales .",
    "the secondary radius is given by the compton wavelength of the higgs field , @xmath66 , and the secondary mass is given by @xmath67 .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath47 given above ( @xmath68 ) , we can define a parameter @xmath9 ( with @xmath69 ) as @xmath70 which displays the coupling between both , mass over radius scales .",

    "for instance , @xmath74 can be considered as fixed once the other three quantities are known .      here",
    ", we overview the solutions found in @xcite keeping in mind that we will later want them for comparison .",
    "we present the metric and matter functions as a function of radius , discuss the naked horizon behavior and",
    "the coulumb character of this type of solutions , put a schwarzschild black hole inside , and resketch some diagrams covering the space of solutions .    from the last subsection",
    ", low @xmath9 indicates a small higgs mass @xmath75 , or large associated compton wavelength , which means that the higgs does not participate in the dynamics , it has very little influence on the monopole structure .",
    "reinterpreted through equation ( [ definitionofb ] ) one can also see the low @xmath9 case as a monopole with small secondary mass @xmath76 or large secondary radius @xmath74 .",
    "given a low @xmath9 configuration , we want now to understand how the structure changes as gravity is turned on higher and higher , i.e. , as the parameter @xmath77 increases .",
    "let us start with @xmath60 ( see equation ( [ definitionofa ] ) ) small .",
    "this means a highly dispersed magnetic monopole with small mass @xmath78 and large radius @xmath79 .",
    "as @xmath60 increases the solution gets more general relativistic and eventually should get to a black hole , where @xmath80 ( for instance , if the configuration formed a schwarzschild black hole @xmath81 , or if it formed an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xmath82 ) .",
    "it does not happen exactly like this .",
    "the solution in the limit of @xmath83 yields a quasi - black hole as defined in @xcite . to get a grip on the solutions we draw in figure [ lowbmonopole ] diagrams showing the metric functions and the matter field functions as a function of @xmath84 for two values of @xmath60 , @xmath60 small and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath85 signals the existence of a black hole horizon , the function @xmath86 is the redshift function , the product function @xmath87 tells whether a horizon is naked or not , and the functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 report on the hair or no - hair of the solution . more specifically :",
    "( i ) the function @xmath85 , or better @xmath90 , indicates how strong the curvature is , and in particular indicates the existence of a black hole horizon . at @xmath91 , @xmath90 should be 1 in order that there are no conical singularities , and at @xmath92 should be again 1 for asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "now , for @xmath93 spacetime is flat and @xmath94 for all @xmath84 . for small @xmath60",
    "there is a small dip at intermediate @xmath84 as shown in figure [ lowbmonopole ] . for large @xmath60",
    "the dip is large , and for @xmath95 , @xmath90 is zero , indicating that a black hole horizon might have formed , here an extremal one since @xmath90 gets a double zero . in fact , as was first noticed in @xcite , a true extremal black never forms .",
    "instead , for a configuration with a radius arbitrarily near the critical radius , a quasi - black hole forms ( i.e. , a matter solution whose gravitational properties are virtual indistinguishable from a black hole @xcite ) , and at @xmath83 precisely , a degenerate spacetime appears as it is found when one looks to the metric function @xmath86 .",
    "( ii ) the metric function @xmath86 gives the redshift behavior , or the relative behavior of clocks at different spatial positions .",
    "it is the function that distinguishes a true black hole from a quasi - black hole , as we will now see .",
    "for @xmath93 , one has @xmath96 . for small @xmath60",
    ", @xmath86 lowers at the origin showing the existence of a gravitational potential , and goes to 1 at @xmath92 . for @xmath95 or",
    "very near it , @xmath86 goes again to one at @xmath92 , but now it is zero up to the monopole radius .",
    "this is odd , the infinite redshift surface is not a surface it is a three - dimensional region . to be a black hole",
    "@xmath86 should go to zero at a given @xmath84 only .",
    "this means that the solution at @xmath95 does not represent a smooth manifold .",
    "thus , the quasi - black hole configuration gives rise to a degenerated spacetime . for @xmath60 very near the critical value it is very hard to distinguish the quasi - black hole solution from a true black hole .",
    "the radius of these quasi - black holes is denoted by @xmath97 , and is arbitrarily near to the radius of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole of same mass and charge , see figure [ lowbmonopole ] .",
    "[ t ]   the graphs of the metric and matter functions , @xmath98 , are plotted as a function of @xmath84 in the low @xmath9 case .",
    "the curves @xmath60 small are typical of small gravitational effects , and the curves @xmath60 critical give the properties of the extremal quasi - black hole .",
    "the radius @xmath3 is the the radius at which the quasi - horizon is formed , see text for details.,title=\"fig : \" ]    \\(iii ) one should also pay attention to the behavior of @xmath87 , which says whether the horizon is naked or not , as it will be precised below . for @xmath93 one has @xmath99 . for @xmath60 small , @xmath87 is small at @xmath91 and 1 at @xmath92 . for @xmath95 , @xmath87",
    "is @xmath100 up to @xmath97 and then steps into @xmath101 , see figure [ lowbmonopole ] .",
    "it is interesting to comment further on the behavior of @xmath87 and its consequences . for the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions",
    "@xmath87 is 1 for all radii .",
    "however , it is not so here , as can be seen directly in figure [ lowbmonopole ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath102 for @xmath103 at the critical solution implies that the black hole horizon formed has a naked behavior @xcite .",
    "this means that the components of the riemann tensor at the horizon in an orthonormal frame blow up at the horizon . it can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose a particle sent in through the monopole , by a distant observer , turns around , and comes back to the point where it started .",
    "suppose also the monopole is on the verge of forming a horizon , i.e. , the monopole surface is a quasi - horizon .",
    "due to the very small value of @xmath87 inside and at the quasi - horizon ( see figure [ lowbmonopole ] ) , one finds that the proper time the particle takes for the round trip is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath3 is the radius of the quasi - horizon , @xmath105 is a very small quantity near the critical solution , and @xmath106 is found by numerical methods to be @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "so the particle takes virtual zero time within the quasi - horizon .",
    "this fact is related to the black hole nakedeness .",
    "the riemann tensor on a particle gives essentially the tidal forces in the particle .",
    "it can be shown that the riemann tensor in these cases is inversely proportional to the square of the proper time it takes the particle to cross the region @xcite .",
    "thus if the proper time is zero , the riemann tensor , and thus the tidal forces are huge , giving rise to a naked behavior , the horizon is exposed . here",
    "@xmath108 , where @xmath109 means calculated in the freely falling frame , and the indexes @xmath110 are spatial indexes .",
    "so , these are naked black holes .",
    "note that for the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm , and extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes , the riemann tensor calculated in the frame falling with the particle is well behaved , so the horizon is well behaved , a result that is known otherwise .",
    "the other interesting time to compute in the round trip is the coordinate time .",
    "it is given by @xmath111 .",
    "thus , for a coordinate observer , the particle takes a long time to return .",
    "this coordinate time can be important for entropic considerations @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the function @xmath88 for the yang - mills field shows for @xmath60 small a @xmath112 fall off for large @xmath84 , and for @xmath95 it disappears for radii grater than @xmath97 .",
    "( v ) the function @xmath89 of the higgs field for small @xmath60 is zero and then grows to pick up the higgs vacuum value at large @xmath84 . for @xmath95 it grows from @xmath100 at the origin to @xmath101 at the horizon , and stays at 1 up to infinity .",
    "this means that there is no hair , outside the horizon , only the trivial magnetic and vacuum higgs fields .",
    "these quasi - black holes have been termed coulumb type quasi - black holes since they show a coulumb ( no hair ) field when they form @xcite .",
    "up to now we have mentioned the behavior of regular gravitating monopoles , i.e. , solutions that are regular from the origin to infinity .",
    "one can now put a small schwarzschild black hole , with mass @xmath113 and radius @xmath114 , inside the magnetic monopole .",
    "this system is an example of a non - abelian black hole with hair .",
    "one could think that putting a schwarzschild black hole inside the monopole would disrupt the structure , and turn the monopole solution into a time - dependent one with the yang - mills and higgs fields being accreted onto the black hole .",
    "but this is not the case , matter , with energy density @xmath115 and radial pressure component @xmath116 , can coexist with an event horizon at its location as long as @xmath117 , a result that follows directly from the conservation equation @xmath118 .",
    "a well known example is the schwarzschild - de sitter solution , where the cosmological constant term @xmath119 can be seen as a fluid which certainly obeys @xmath117 .",
    "following @xcite one finds that the non - abelian structure inside the monopole may be approximated as a uniform vacuum energy density @xmath120 up to the monopole radius @xmath121 such that the black hole in this region has a metric identical to the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole . for small black holes",
    "the condition @xmath117 is obeyed and they can inhabit the center of the monopole , i.e. , small black holes inside do not perturb much the solution . however , when the schwarzschild black hole is large enough , such that its mass is of the order of the mass of the system , the system itself collapses giving rise to a magnetically charged extremal reissner - nordstrm quasi - black hole .",
    "we note that the literature is not clear whether it forms a true extremal black hole or an extremal quasi - black hole , however by continuity from the regular case one is entitled to infer that it is a quasi - black hole , followed by a degenerated spacetime at the critical value .",
    "the appearance of this quasi - black hole happens for a critical value of the parameter @xmath60 , with @xmath122 , or alternatively , for a critical value of the total mass @xmath123 , with @xmath124 .",
    "the behavior is thus analogous to the regular monopole in the sense that as one increases gravitation , i.e. , as the parameter @xmath60 or the mass @xmath123 of the system increases , one finds a a magnetically charged extremal reissner - nordstrm quasi - black hole .",

    "specifically the behavior of the functions is : ( i ) the function @xmath90 , the metric function that signals the formation of a black hole , shows that very near @xmath83 there are two radial scales , where horizon could be formed , one at @xmath132 ( related to the scale set by the higgs mass ) , the other at @xmath97 ( related to the scale set by the the w mass ) , but at @xmath133 the double zero occurs at @xmath134 , and an extremal horizon appears there .",
    "( ii ) the metric function @xmath86 shows also a zero at @xmath132 signaling the formation of an infinite redshift surface .",
    "note now that @xmath86 is zero at one point only , @xmath134 , not in a whole region as was the case for low @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the configuration quasi - black hole with radius very near @xmath132 , turns into a true extremal black hole rather than to a degenerate spacetime as in the low @xmath9 case .",
    "( iii ) the behavior of @xmath87 , which tells whether the horizon is naked or not , confirms this behavior .",
    "it shows that it is never zero , meaning the horizon is a regular , not a naked one @xcite .",
    "this means that the components of the riemann tensor at the horizon in an orthonormal frame are well behaved . in this case",
    "a particle that is sent in through the monopole , turns around , and comes back to the point where it started , takes a proper time @xmath135 which is finite , non - zero .",
    "thus , since the riemann tensor is proportional to @xmath136 , as discussed in connection to the low @xmath9 case , there is no funny behavior at the horizon and all behaves well .",
    "( iv ) the function @xmath88 for the yang - mills field shows that for @xmath83 there is field outside the horizon radius , i.e. , there is hair .",
    "( v ) the function @xmath89 for the higgs field , behaves similarly to @xmath88 . in the critical situation",
    ", it only acquires the vacuum value for radii much larger than @xmath132 .",
    "[ t ]   the graphs of the metric and matter functions , @xmath98 , are plotted as a function of @xmath84 in the high @xmath9 case .",
    "the curves @xmath60 small are typical of small gravitational effects , and the curves @xmath60 critical give the properties of the extremal quasi - black hole .",
    "the radius @xmath3 is the the radius at which the quasi - horizon is formed , see text for details.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there are three points that are worth commenting .",
    "first , we comment further on the behavior of @xmath87 and its consequences . in terms of the coordinate time , the particle takes for the round trip the time @xmath137 , where again @xmath138 is a very small number .",
    "thus the particle takes , as in the low @xmath9 case , a long time to return to a coordinate observer , and this is important in connection with entropy issues @xcite .",
    "indeed , in leading order , this time is determined only from the spacetime geometry .",
    "an observer finds that the quasi - black hole has an inside which is inaccessible , since probes stay there for an arbitrarily large amount of time , and describes it by a density matrix @xmath139 obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom inside the quasi - horizon , yielding an entropy @xmath140 .",
    "the calculation of the interior entropy of a field inside a spherical box was performed for a scalar field with the result that @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is an undetermined factor , and @xmath85 is the area of the box @xcite . in this case , the box is the magnetic monopole quasi - horizon configuration on the verge of being a black hole .",
    "since one can give a little push from this configuration to the horizon configuration , and in the latter case the entropy is @xmath143 one can guess by continuity that the coefficient of proportionality in the quasi - horizon case has a dependence on the size of the box @xmath144 and when a horizon forms , @xmath145 @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the entropy of the extremal black hole is the number of the entangled degrees of freedom inside the horizon .",
    "this analysis can not be applied to the low @xmath9 case because there is never a true horizon : in the limit , when the object is turning into a black hole it gives a non - smooth manifold .",
    "second , another feature of these monopoles is that they have a charge to mass ratio given by @xmath146 .",
    "thus if one drops neutral matter onto a regular magnetic monopole one can form an extremal black hole @xcite .",
    "this is contrary to the case of electric reissner - nordstrm black holes with @xmath147 , and where one can drop charged matter , with charge @xmath106 and mass @xmath148 obeying @xmath149 , as much as one wants that one never gets an extremal black hole ( this is a version of the third law of black hole mechanics ) .",
    "third , one can ask what happens for @xmath60 higher than the critical value . following",
    "@xcite one finds that there are possibly two branches .",
    "one branch is formed of magnetically abelian charged reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "the other branch , has non - abelian matter and hair outside , a horizon , and regular non - abelian matter inside .",
    "following theorems by borde @xcite one finds that these regular solutions may have different inside and outside topologies .",
    "this issue should be further explored .      as in the low @xmath9 case",
    "one can put a schwarzschild black hole inside .",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "the main feature is that again there is hair outside the true horizon .",
    "the results are in line with what we have been discussing .",
    "diagrams like those of figures 2 and 3 can be drawn , although we have not found them in the literature .      thus , gravitationally there are two distinct behaviors , the low @xmath9 case and the high @xmath9 case , the marginal case being at @xmath150 .",
    "the low @xmath9 case has the following main features : when one turns on gravitation ( when one increases @xmath60 ) a quasi - black hole appears from the regular monopole , which turns into a degenerate spacetime at the critical value @xmath83 ; it has a naked horizon , and shows no hair , i.e. , it is of coulumb type , the non - trivial fields are hidden inside the horizon . in addition , one can enrich the monopole structure by putting a schwarzschild black hole inside up to a certain maximum mass .",
    "the high @xmath9 case has also a regular monopole solution which , when one increases the gravitational parameter @xmath60 , turns into a quasi - black hole , and then at @xmath83 a true extremal black hole appears , with regular horizon and hair .",
    "there is a transition between the two cases , a first order type transition .",
    "when @xmath9 is in the transition zone , there is a double double zero , one zero at @xmath3 and the other at @xmath132 .",
    "so , the transition is discontinuous in radius , and thus in entropy .",
    "it is , however , continuous in mass @xcite .",
    "other features that are also very interesting but not important in our context are : ( i ) for very low @xmath9 ( @xmath151 , say ) , the behavior is more complicated near @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "if one increases @xmath60 from zero , one passes @xmath83 up to an @xmath152 . but from @xmath83 to @xmath152 there are two solutions , one with larger mass @xmath78 ( larger radius @xmath79 ) , the other with smaller values .",
    "the one with smaller values is the one that connects continuously with the low mass solutions .",
    "the smaller mass solutions are stable , and so the branch which forms black holes is unstable ; ( ii ) for a certain range of the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath9 , there are multiple node solutions ( nodes appearing in the function @xmath34 of the yang - mills field ) of the type found in the bartnick - mckinonn solution @xcite ; ( iii ) the particular case @xmath153 in the high @xmath9 sector was analyzed in detail by aichelburg and bizon @xcite .",
    "the solution has a conical singularity at @xmath91 but apart from that it is well - behaved .",
    "perhaps , oddly , core behavior in this limit was not found , we will comment on this later on .",

    "it is not difficult to see that this thin shell is a solution of the majumdar - papapetrou system @xcite .",

    "( [ constraint - mp ] ) is the equivalent to the constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) in the magnetic monopole case .",

    "( iv ) at @xmath60 arbitrarily near @xmath83 , the function @xmath219 does not have a coulumb type behavior as one can see from figure [ mphighbstar ] , the elctric field outside the quasi - horizon gets a bump due to the presence of the outer shell . strictly speaking one can not talk of a no - hair violation since",
    "the no - hair theorem is applied to black holes , not quasi - black holes .",
    "( v ) the surface density function @xmath220 of the charged dust is also drawn , for completeness .",
    "there are two questions that can be asked .",
    "the first one is what happens if one increases @xmath60 past @xmath83 . for @xmath238",
    "one gets an extremal electric reissner - nordstrm black hole outside the shell with radius @xmath182 .",
    "this secondary shell then collapses , leaving an extremal black holes with a star shell outside .",
    "this is then analogous to the extremal black hole solution inside the star shell discussed previously in the low @xmath9 case . upon increasing @xmath60",
    "further one hits a new critical value , @xmath258 , where a new horizon forms at the exterior star shell @xmath178 .",
    "the second question is what happens when @xmath153 . in the magnetic monopole system",
    "this case has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "when one increases @xmath9 , keeping @xmath60 fixed , one finds that @xmath182 gets relatively smaller and smaller .",
    "the behavior is best displayed by looking into the @xmath90 plot of figure [ mphighbstar ] .",
    "for @xmath60 small and fixed , when one increases @xmath9 the minimum at @xmath182 is displaced more and more toward @xmath91 .",
    "eventually at @xmath153 the minimum hits the @xmath91 line at a point @xmath90 less than one , which means that the configuration starts at a conical singularity .",
    "this example shows why @xcite did not get the high @xmath9 behavior found in @xcite , namely , a smooth black hole formation in the core of the magnetic monopole .",
    "what happens is that for @xmath153 a horizon ( a kind of singularity ) in the inner secondary shell does not form at the core because the initial configuration already possesses at the core ( @xmath91 ) a conical singularity ( another kind of singularity which substitutes the horizon in this limit @xmath153 ) .",
    "this conical configuration exists for a given typical value of @xmath60 . upon increasing @xmath60",
    "further one hits a critical value for @xmath60 ( corresponding to the @xmath258 mentioned above ) where a new quasi - horizon forms at the exterior star shell @xmath178 .      as in the low @xmath9 case , where an extremal black hole was put inside the low @xmath9 shells , one can also put an extremal black hole inside the high @xmath9 shells .",
    "we will not do this here since the behavior is similar to the previous cases . in the magnetic monopole high @xmath9 case this was done in @xcite .      _",
    "( i ) the @xmath214 configuration : _ 0.3 cm    we have treated the cases @xmath208 and @xmath211 .",
    "the case @xmath214 is also worth commenting as a limiting case .",
    "the new feature is that at @xmath259 the function @xmath90 develops two double zeros , one at the secondary shell @xmath182 , the other at the star shell @xmath178 .",
    "thus , on going from @xmath208 to @xmath211 the quasi - horizon jumps discontinuously in radius at some critical @xmath60 .",
    "if the entropy of this object can be related to the area of the object , as was done in @xcite , then the entropy also jumps discontinuously when one passes from @xmath208 to @xmath211 . in the transition",
    "there is no mass jump , the mass is continuous , so that it is a kind of first order phase transition .    0.5 cm _",
    "( ii ) more complex configurations : _ 0.3 cm    one can put a third extremal matter shell inside the other two . in this case one has two new parameters , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , and a new dimensionless parameter @xmath262 can be given .",
    "in analogy with @xmath60 and @xmath9 of equations ( [ definitionofa - mp ] ) and ( [ definitionofb - mp ] ) , one finds , @xmath263 assume also as the constraint equation that @xmath264 .",

    "equalities mean that the three quasi - horizons form together with @xmath226 , @xmath277 and @xmath215 .",
    "two quasi - horizons alone can not form together .",
    "one can continue to put more shells with the emergence of ever more complex behavior in the function @xmath90 .",
    "this type of behavior should also happen in non - abelian theories with more higgs scales",

    "( iii ) other configurations : _ 0.3 cm other configurations that could be dealt with are a thick shell within a thin shell , with the thick shell being the solution found in @xcite .",
    "the behavior is similar to what we have been discussing . for the low @xmath9 case it will give for @xmath83 an extremal naked , coulumb ( no - hair ) , quasi - black hole . for high @xmath9 it would give an extremal naked , non - coulumb ( hair ) , quasi - black hole .",
    "one can also put an extremal black hole inside a thick shell , although there is no known exact solution for it .",
    "we have shown that gravitational magnetic monopoles and majumdar - papapetrou stars , in the form of two thin shells , have common properties .",
    "we have shown that both systems have extremal quasi - black hole solutions , some without hair while others developing some type of hair .",
    "both , the monopole system and the two shell majumdar - papapetrou system , possess solutions with naked behavior , i.e. , tidal forces tend to infinity at the quasi - horizon . at the critical value",
    "the interior solution does not give a smooth manifold .",
    "for other parameters in the space of solutions of the magnetic monopole system , specifically for high higgs mass , there are solutions with non - naked behavior , allowing the formation of a true black hole . on the other hand , the two shell majumdar - papapetrou system ,",
