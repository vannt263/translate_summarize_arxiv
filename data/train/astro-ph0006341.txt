    "with the launch of fuse in 1999 the window to high - resolution far - uv spectroscopy has been opened again . in order to prepare an adequate analysis of the upcoming data for hot compact stars , we studied already available high - resolution orfeusii echelle spectra using state - of - the - art nlte ( non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ) model atmospheres with elaborated model atoms including the opacities of millions of iron and nickel lines .",
    "this paper pursues three aims : first we want to outline a basic approach for spectral analysis of future high - resolution far - uv spectra under the viewpoint of iron - group line blanketing .",
    "the second aim is a presentation of possible error sources and an estimation of the uncertainties of the abundances derived .",
    "the third aim is an improved determination of the iron and nickel abundance of our demonstration object , the sdo feige  67 .    a commonly used approach to determine fe and ni abundances is the analysis of individual , prominent line profiles within a narrow wavelength range .",
    "for this purpose the observed and the synthetic spectra are normalized to the continuum . however , we will show that the detection of the stellar continuum can be extremely difficult or impossible because of the presence of millions of lines from the iron - group elements .",
    "hence , derived abundances may be afflicted with substantial errors .",
    "we will demonstrate that reliable analyses of far - uv spectra , like from e.g.  orfeus or fuse , require a sufficiently large spectral base into the near - uv region , where line blanketing is less severe , so that the model flux can be normalized to the continuum in that range .",
    "for this purpose we analyzed the combined orfeusii and iue spectra of the sdo feige  67 , covering the wavelength range from 900   to 3200 .",
    "feige  67 is well suited to demonstrate the difficulties and possible error sources related to the fe and ni line blanketing effect , because it is known for its overabundance of the elements ( probably due to radiative levitation ) and because high - resolution spectra are available and the stellar parameters ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : properties ] ) are well known @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the effective temperature by the ionization equilibria of fe and ni .",
    "our re - analysis of the fe and ni abundances results in smaller values compared to the abundances derived by @xcite , however , we expect no strong back - reaction on the atmospheric structure which in turn might lead to a different @xmath5 .",
    "thus we concentrate here on a thorough analysis of the effect of different fe and ni abundances on the synthetic spectrum .    in the following",
    "we describe briefly the observation and data reduction ( sect .",
    "2 ) followed by a short outline of the model atmospheres used ( sect .  3 ) . in sect .  4",
    "we discuss the four most important steps of the analysis and present the major error sources by means of illustrative figures .",
    "the results are summarized in sect .",
    "the echelle spectrometer was one of the focal instruments of the orfeus telescope , which was flown on its second mission in november / december 1996 .",
    "the wavelength range is 900 - 1400  with a spectral resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "two separate observations of feige  67 were obtained with a total integration time of 2954s ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : properties ] ) .",
    "the two echelle images were co - added and then the standard extraction procedure was applied @xcite .",
    "feige  67 has been observed with the iue satellite in the short and in the long wavelength range ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : properties ] ) . for our analysis",
    "we used the so - called `` preview spectra '' available in the iue final archive .",
    "any relative error in the flux calibration of the different instruments with respect to each other will propagate into the error bar of the stellar parameters to be derived , because we will rely on the correct overall shape of the combined spectrum .",
    "[ fig : lwp_swp_orf_flux - calibration ] shows the good flux calibration of all three observations of feige  67 , because of a good match of the adjoining spectral regions . on hand of our final model",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : unsmoothed - smoothed ] the strong line blanketing in the far - uv spectral region , which results in an overall flux depression . particularly in the degraded spectrum .",
    "based on the results of @xcite we calculated a plane - parallel non - lte model atmosphere with and logg = 5.0 in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium . according to @xcite the fe and ni abundances",
    "were set to 10 and 70 times solar , respectively . in order to calculate synthetic spectra with different fe and ni abundances , a single formal solution of the radiation transfer equation",
    "is performed keeping fixed the whole model structure .",
    "the computer code is based on the accelerated lambda iteration method @xcite and it can handle the line blanketing of iron - group elements by a statistical approach using superlevels and superlines with an opacity sampling technique @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "a summary of the detailed model atoms used is given in tab .",
    "[ tab : atoms ] .",
    "test calculations for feige  67 have shown , that and are the dominant ionization stages in those atmospheric layers where the iron lines are formed .",
    "for the calculation of opacities of iron group elements one can choose between a subset of the kurucz @xcite line list , containing only lines known from laboratory spectra , and the full one , augmented by a vast number of theoretically computed lines .",
    "the full line list is afflicted with uncertainties in oscillator strengths and wavelength positions , preventing the identification of individual lines when comparing with observed spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lines-990 - 1010 ] ) .",
    "the small list on the other hand causes much too less total opacity .",
    "[ fig : large - small ] demonstrates the high relevance of using the full line list for further analysis in the far - uv range .",
    "it also demonstrates the impossibility to determine the stellar continuum , so that analyses with model atmospheres must rely on a correct flux normalization in the near - uv where line blanketing is less severe .",
    "in the following we discuss and determine the most important parameters which influence the observed spectrum . due to their interacting character the analysis has to be done iteratively .",
    "the interstellar hi column density along the line of sight is derived from the ly@xmath23 profile in the orfeusii spectrum ( fig .  [",
    "fig : nh_orfeus ] ) .",
    "we applied different models and found no dependency of the derived column density on the adopted fe and ni abundance ( which might be caused by strong blending of the ly@xmath23 profile ) and obtained n@xmath24 .",
    "the same result has been derived from the ly@xmath23 profile in the iue - swp spectrum .",
    "note that we did not try to normalize the model continuum to a putative local stellar continuum near ly@xmath23 , instead we relied on the flux normalization in the near - uv ( see below ) .",
    "therefore interstellar reddening has to be accounted for , otherwise one underestimates n@xmath25 by approximately 0.1dex .",
    "this in turn ( as reddening is calculated from n@xmath25 ) would cause an overestimation of the iron - group abundance by about a factor two .",
    "another source of error can be too strong smoothing of the observation or the model .",
    "even convolution with a gaussian of only fwhm=0.2   corrupts the interstellar ly@xmath23 profile because of many blending iron group lines .",
    "therefore we used a low - pass filter for noise - reduction , the savitzky - golay smoothing filter , as described in @xcite .      based on the determined column density",
    ", the color excess can be calculated to e@xmath26 , using the formula of @xcite @xmath27 an independent determination of the color excess could not be realized , because it is too small to produce a detectable 2200   feature in the iue - lwr spectrum .    in the literature",
    "the applicability of the above formula is debated as well as the choice of the interstellar extinction law itself .",
    "hence some authors try to determine such a law adapted to their specific observation . generally , however , this is impossible , so that in our case we expect a systematic error of at least 0.1dex ( using the interstellar extinction law as described in @xcite ) in addition to the statistical error , which is estimated to 0.1dex from fig .",
    "[ fig : ebv - variation ] .",
    "it is clear that the neglect of interstellar reddening in the far - uv range results in an underestimation of the stellar flux level .",
    "this would lead to an overestimation of the fe and ni abundances , by about a factor of 1.0dex in our specific case .      as already mentioned above , strong line blanketing in the far - uv requires a model flux normalization in the near - uv , where reduced blanketing does not prevent detection of the stellar continuum .",
    "we determined the position of the continuum at the red end of the spectrum above 3000 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalingfactor ] the resulting synthetic flux has been multiplied by a factor of 0.95 and 1.05 , respectively , representing the uncertainty of fixing the continuum in the near - uv . a determination of the continuum only within the far - uv range results in an analytical uncertainty in the iron and nickel abundance of about a factor two ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : scalingfactor ] with [ fig : abu - variation - orf+iue ] ) . neglecting the general slope of the spectrum in the",
    "near - uv and the far - uv may result an additional systematic error of the same magnitude .",
    "after the preparatory steps discussed above one is now in the position to determine the abundances of fe an ni by fitting the spectral slope . fig .",
    "[ fig : abu - variation - orf+iue ] demonstrates the sensitivity of the flux distribution against the simultaneous variation of the fe and ni abundances in the model by @xmath28dex .",
    "detailed calculations have shown , that modifications in the fe abundance are mainly noticeable in the ranges 9601140   and 13601510 , whereas modifications in the ni abundance occur dominantly in the range 10301330 .",
    "the resulting abundances of the best fitting model are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : properties ] .    a determination of the fe and ni abundance by fitting the profile of individual lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lines-1300 - 1330 ] ) is rather problematic because of , as stated above , blending by lines with inaccurately known wavelength positions and oscillator strengths .",
    "in order to derive the iron and nickel abundances in the sdo star feige  67 we proceeded in two major steps . at first we considered the shape of the spectrum over a broad wavelength range .",
    "here we focused on the correct consideration of all effects of physical relevance , i.e.  large model atoms , n@xmath1 determination , and interstellar reddening as well as on effects of technical relevance , i.e. determination of the continuum and quality of the flux calibration . as a result",
    "we could demonstrate the important influence of these details for the second step , where the fe and ni abundances are derived from the orfeusii spectrum .",
    "we confirmed the high fe and ni abundances of feige  67 and find 3.5 and 26.5 times solar , respectively ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : properties ] ) , which are however a factor three smaller than the results by @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived fe and ni abundances of approximately 10 times solar , based on the iue - swp observations and using models with @xmath5=70000k . the reasons for this more deviating result can be i ) the lower , probably more realistic @xmath5 of our model ( based on the analysis of @xcite ) , ii ) our use of self - consistent metal - line blanketed models in contrast to the becker & butler approach , and iii ) an increased accuracy of our analysis using combined orfeusii , iue - swp and iue - lwr observations .",
    "at present the accuracy of fe and ni abundance determinations is limited mainly by uncertainties of the atomic data available and by the s / n ratio and resolution of the spectra .",
    "therefore an error in the derived abundances of a factor of about two has to be accepted . for a reliable analysis of far - uv spectra",
    "complementary near - uv observations are recommended .",
    "uncertainties in the knowledge of interstellar reddening enlarges the systematic error .",
    "generally , we have demonstrated the importance of correctly considerating iron - group line blanketing for the analysis of future high - resolution far - uv spectra of hot compact stars .",
    "this more detailed analysis technique enables to fully benefit from the improved high - resolution spectra of fuse .",
