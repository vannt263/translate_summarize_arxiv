    "in the discrete quantum mechanics ( dqm ) , developed by the present authors , the time - independent schrdinger equation is a second order _ difference _ equation instead of a second order _",
    "equation in the ordinary quantum mechanics ( oqm ) .",
    "the basic framework of quantum mechanics , such as the probability interpretation , the hilbert space structure , the continuous real time , etc . is unchanged and the only difference is the discrete forms of various hamiltonians .",
    "the discrete quantum mechanics can be considered as a generalisation ( deformation ) of the ordinary qm in the sense that a differential equation can be obtained from a difference equation in an appropriate limit .",
    "the generalisation is also consistent with heisenberg s idea that a certain fundamental length would appear in the theory at some stage of descending the microscopic ladder .",
    "this generalisation has turned out to be extremely fruitful .",
    "most of the concepts and methods of oqm can be easily transplanted to dqm , offering a unified platform for the systematic understanding of various orthogonal polynomials satisfying second order difference equations with the pure _ imaginary shifts _ ( idqm ) as well as the _ real shifts _ ( rdqm ) .",
    "sometimes these polynomials are said to have the _ bi - spectral property _",
    "they satisfy two types of spectral conditions , the difference eigenvalue ( schrdinger ) equation and the three term recurrence relations .",
    "those polynomials satisfying the difference equations with the real shifts are also called the orthogonal polynomials of a _ discrete variable _",
    "they contain most of the ( @xmath4)-hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials belonging to the askey scheme @xcite .",
    "the power of the discrete qm is demonstrated most eloquently in the discovery of various infinite families of _ new orthogonal _ ( _ exceptional _ ) _ polynomials_. in less than two years after the discovery of the infinite family of the exceptional laguerre and jacobi polynomials @xcite , the generic counterparts in dqm , the exceptional wilson , askey - wilson , racah and @xmath4-racah polynomials are constructed by the present authors @xcite .",
    "these new orthogonal polynomials are expected to play a significant role in mathematics , mathematical physics and related disciplines .",
    "the exceptional jacobi polynomials provide infinitely many global solutions of fuchsian differential equations with more than three and arbitrarily many regular singularities @xcite , although the locations of the extra singularities are rigidly specified .",
    "this topical review of dqm provides a comprehensive overview of the subjects related to the _ exactly and quasi - exactly solvable _ quantum particle dynamics @xcite@xcite . due to the length constraints",
    ", we have to concentrate on the systems of single degree of freedom , which is the most basic and best established part of the theory .",
    "the subjects to be covered in this article are the adaptation to dqm of the methods and concepts of oqm accumulated over 80 years after the birth of quantum mechanics .",
    "after the general setting of the discrete quantum mechanics with the pure imaginary shifts ( idqm ) as well as the real shifts ( rdqm ) , we start with the _ factorised _ hamiltonians and the schrdinger equations @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the solution spaces is explored by the intertwining relations and crum s theorem together with its modification @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "exact solvability in the schrdinger picture is explained by the _ shape invariance _ @xcite . the _ generic eigenvalue formula _ , _ unified rodrigues formulas _ and the _ forward / backward shift operators _ are deduced .",
    "the solvability in the heisenberg picture is derived based on the _ closure relation _ between the _ sinusoidal coordinate _ and the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the _ creation / annihilation _ operators are introduced and their connection with the _ three term recurrence relations _ of the orthogonal polynomials is emphasised .",
    "the _ dynamical symmetry algebra _ generated by the hamiltonian and the creation / annihilation operators are also established for all the solvable systems in the heisenberg picture @xcite .",
    "this includes the dynamical realisation of the @xmath4-oscillator algebras @xcite .",
    "for the rdqm , the _ dual pair _ of orthogonal polynomials ( the leonard pair @xcite ) and the related askey - wilson algebras @xcite are explored .",
    "the unified theory of exactly and quasi - exactly solvable dqm is another major theme of this review .",
    "based on the fundamental properties of various sinusoidal coordinates , a simple recipe to construct a solvable dqm hamiltonian is provided @xcite .",
    "it generates all known exactly solvable theories and many new ones . as a byproduct it also gives a recipe of constructing quasi - exactly solvable dqm hamiltonians .",
    "the final major subject of the review is the new ( exceptional ) orthogonal polynomials @xcite@xcite,@xcite@xcite .    throughout the review we stress the similarity and differences among oqm , idqm and rdqm . as far as possible",
    "we adopt the same notation and present one all - inclusive formula for the three categories , oqm , idqm and rdqm .",
    "the differences are exhibited by explicit examples .",
    "we usually adopt three examples from each group denoted by the name of the corresponding eigenpolynomials with an abbreviation . for the oqm , they are the hermite ( h ) , the laguerre ( l ) and the jacobi ( j ) polynomials . for the idqm",

    ", we require the wavefunction and potential functions etc to be _ analytic _ functions of @xmath7 with their domains including the real axis or a part of it on which the dynamical variable @xmath7 is defined .",
    "in contrast , in the rdqm , the difference equation gives constraints on wavefunctions only on equally spaced lattice points .",
    "then we choose , after proper rescaling , the variable @xmath7 to take value of non - negative _ integers _ , with the total number either finite ( @xmath17 ) or infinite ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) .",

    "we will consider the hamiltonians having a finite ( rdqm with finite @xmath28 ) or semi - infinite number of _ discrete energy levels only _ : @xmath29 the additive constant of the hamiltonian is so chosen that the groundstate energy vanishes .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian is _ positive semi - definite_. it is a well known theorem in linear algebra that any positive semi - definite hermitian matrix can be factorised as a product of a certain matrix , say @xmath30 , and its hermitian conjugate @xmath31 .",
    "as we will see shortly , the hamiltonians we consider always have factorised forms in one - dimension as well as in higher dimensions .",

    "the condition @xmath49 in rdqm is necessary for the term @xmath50 not to appear in @xmath51 .",
    "likewise @xmath52 is necessary for the finite case . roughly speaking these correspond to the regular singularities in oqm .",

    "we require @xmath57 to be chosen real and positive for the physical values of @xmath7 , which is always guaranteed in oqm .",
    "one important distinction between a differential and a difference equation is the _ uniqueness _ of the solution . for a linear differential equation , the solution is unique when the initial conditions are specified .",
    "in contrast , a solution of a difference schrdinger equation multiplied by any periodic function of a period @xmath68 ( @xmath69 for idqm , @xmath70 for rdqm ) is another solution . in the case of idqm ,",
    "this non - uniqueness is removed by requiring the finite norm condition for the groundstate wavefunction @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the hermiticity ( self - adjointness ) condition of the hamiltonian . for details , see @xcite appendix a. for the rdqm , the periodic ambiguity of period 1 is harmless since the values of eigenfunctions on the integer lattice points only count for the inner products , etc .",
