    "young stars are critical in understanding not just the star - formation process itself but also the formation of planetary systems , through observation of their circumstellar environment @xcite .",
    "this is most efficiently achieved from the nearest possible vantage point , which makes nearby young stars very sought - after targets @xcite .",
    "nearby young stars have become prime targets to achieve direct exoplanet imaging @xcite because massive planets are expected to be much more easily detected in their youth at a time when they still shine bright from their own gravitational collapse .",
    "young stars are known to exist in the vicinity of the sun as members of `` moving groups '' , each consisting in loose associations of stars moving in the same approximate direction within the solar neighborhood .",
    "proposed nearby moving groups and associations include the castor moving group @xcite , the @xmath0 pictoris moving group @xcite , the tucana / horologium association @xcite , the ab doradus moving group @xcite , the carina - near moving group @xcite , and notably the very young tw hydrae association @xcite whose probable members include several brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "all of these nearby moving groups and associations are suspected to be dispersed fragments from a larger neighboring ob association @xcite .",
    "stars from nearby moving groups and associations are identified and confirmed through a combination of kinematic data and evidence of youth .",
    "most of the original members were identified based on their full ( three dimentional ) kinematics provided by accurate proper motion and parallax from the hipparcos catalog @xcite , complemented with radial velocity observations . while it is relatively straightforward to identify moving group members among samples of stars for which both proper motion _ and _ parallax data exist ,",
    "it is more complicated to search for members among field stars with no parallax data in hand .",
    "proper motion measurements are now widely available for vast numbers of stars from all - sky proper motion catalogs such as tycho-2 @xcite , usno - b1.0 @xcite , or superblink @xcite , but parallax and radial velocity measurements remain relatively rare , particularly for stars with visual magnitude @xmath5 mag . as a result ,",
    "one must rely on secondary diagnostics , such as unambiguous signs of youth , to search for moving group members .",
    "young low - mass stars are expected to have faster rates of rotation and thus higher coronal activity through a stronger dynamo effect @xcite .",
    "high coronal activity is associated with strong emission lines of atomic hydrogen and large x - ray emission .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of x - ray sources from the _ rosat _ catalogs has yielded positive identification of many nearby young stars , including new members of the tw hydrae association @xcite and the @xmath0 pictoris moving group @xcite .",
    "however , the _ rosat _ catalogs are flux limited , and though they are useful in identifying nearby young stars , they can not serve as the basis for a _ complete census _ of moving group members .",
    "it is telling that most confirmed members of young moving groups consist in stars of spectral subtype f , g , or k , and include few low - mass stars of spectral type m. assuming those groups to follow the standard initial mass function , one would expect them to have significantly larger numbers of associated low - mass stars .",
    "such low - mass members arguably are particularly promising targets for exoplanet surveys @xcite because the detectability of planets of a given mass is improved when the parent star has low intrinsic luminosity .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a general technique to identify new members of known moving groups among stars listed in large proper motion catalogs .",
    "we demonstrate the technique by performing a search for new members of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group ( bpmg ) , using a subsample of stars from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite with proper motions @xmath6 mas yr@xmath7 . the general method is described in section 2 .",
    "a list of candidates members of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group is identified in section 3 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations are described in section 4 , and new @xmath0 pictoris members are identified .",
    "conclusions follow in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the mean motion of a local moving group , in the local standard of rest , with @xmath9 a unit vector pointing in the direction of the galactic center , @xmath10 in the direction of the sun s galactic orbital motion , and @xmath11 pointing toward the north galactic pole .",
    "at any point on the sky described by the galactic coordinates @xmath12 , one can calculate the local projected motion in the plane of the sky @xmath13 of the moving group in the direction of galactic longitude @xmath14 and galactic latitude @xmath15 from @xmath16 @xmath17    in galactic coordinates , the angle @xmath18 that this vector @xmath13 subtends with a star s local proper motion vector @xmath19 is @xmath20 wich is easily derived from the definition of the scalar product of the two vectors .",
    "stars which are actual members of the moving groups will have their proper motion vector closely aligned with the projected motion of the group , and will thus have @xmath21 .",
    "one can thus sift through a proper motion catalog and search for potential members of the moving groups by considering only the stars whose proper motion vector is within a few degrees of the expected orientation of the projected motion of the moving group .",
    "this restriction can be expressed simply as : @xmath22 the particular choice of @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) will depend on the accuracy of the catalog s proper motions , and also on the dispersion in velocities between stars of the moving group .",
    "for example , @xmath25 would restrict the sample only to stars whose proper motion is within @xmath26 of the expected projected motion of the moving group .",
    "a value of @xmath27 closer to @xmath28 will considerably restrict the search , but may overlook some actual members .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath27 will be more likely to include all members of the group , but will also produce a larger sample with more contaminants .    proper motion aligned in the direction of the projected motion of the moving group is however not a sufficient condition for a star to be a member of the group , because a given proper motion vector may correspond to a range of transverse velocities , depending on the star s distance .",
    "if the distance @xmath29 to the star is known , then an actual member of the moving group will also verify : @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 given by eqs.1 - 2 above , and where the velocities are in km s@xmath7 and the distance @xmath29 in parsecs .",
    "however , distances are generally not known for stars in proper motion catalogs , the one notable exception being the _ hipparcos _ catalog . for a star with no recorded distance ,",
    "it is however possible to constrain the distance based on color - magnitude relationships .",
    "if one assumes that a star is a member of the moving group , then it is possible to get an accurate distance estimate for that star based on the magnitude of the proper motion alone ; this hypothetical distance can then be checked for consistency using color - magnitude relationships . assuming that one given proper motion star is also a member of the moving group , then its hypothetical , _ kinematically derived _",
    "distance @xmath33 will be @xmath34 if @xmath33 is found to be inconsistent with some other distance estimate , such as a photometric distance , a spectroscopic distance or better yet a parallax distance , then the star can be ruled out as a possible member of the moving group .    unless parallax measurements are already available for the candidate star , it is useful to compare @xmath33 with the photometric distance .",
    "consider the visual magnitude @xmath35 of a proper motion star and its infrared @xmath36 magnitude , if the object is a main - sequence star , then it can be expected to follow a color - magnitude relationship @xmath37 whose form depends on the age of the star .",
    "if a star is a member of the moving group under consideration , and assuming interstellar extinction to be negligible ( generally valid for nearby stars ) , then one expects @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean dispersion about the color - magnitude relationship for members of that particular moving group .",
    "an additional test is to verify that the radial velocity of the prospective moving group member is also consistent with group membership .",
    "a moving group member can be predicted to have a radial velocity @xmath40 such that @xmath41 this prediction can be tested with radial velocity measurements .",
    "ultimately , one would want to confirm group membership by accurately measuring the @xmath42 components of velocity of the source , which requires accurate distance measurement through geometric parallax as well as accurate radial velocities from high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "additionally , moderate- to high - resolution spectroscopy should be used to check for the presence of lithium in the atmosphere ( @xmath436708 in emission ) which is a strong diagnostic for young age as li is progressively depleted over time in low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "however such a detailed analysis of candidate members is expensive .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of moderately faint stars requires long observing times and/or large telescope apertures , and parallax measurements are intensive and require years of careful monitoring .",
    "it would be desirable to pre - select stars with the highest predicted likelihood of being moving group members .",
    "such stars are expected to display secondary evidence of youth , which includes evidence for atmospheric activity such as x - ray flux or h@xmath2 line emission .",
    "while activity in itself does not necessarily imply that a star is young , a high proportion of the most active stars are found to be young objects @xcite .",
    "the above equations and practical considerations provide a road map for identifying elusive members of a known moving group out of a statistically complete catalog of stars with large proper motion .    1 .",
    "isolate a subsample of high proper motion stars whose proper motion vector points in the expected direction for the moving group ( eq .",
    "2 .   identify stars from that subsample for which photometric data shows a match between the hypothetical kinematic distance and the photometric distance ( eq.7 ) .",
    "3 .   reduce the sample further by selecting targets showing evidence for activity , such as strong x - ray or h@xmath2 emission .",
    "4 .   compare the predicted radial velocity ( eq.8 ) to radial velocity measurements to identify probable kinematic members of the group .",
    "confirm kinematic membership through parallax measurements 6 .",
    "confirm young age through detection of @xmath436707 .    in section 3",
    "below , we provide a demonstration of steps 1 - 4 , applied to a subsample of bright high proper motion stars .",
    "we demonstrate the technique described above by performing a search for members of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group in a subsample of high proper motion stars from the tycho-2 catalog of @xcite .",
    "we have assembled a list of 86,626 stars with proper motions @xmath6 mas yr@xmath7 ; their distribution on the sky is shown in figure 1 ( _ top panel _ ) .",
    "this represents an all - sky sample of relatively bright stars .",
    "all objects are listed with tycho-2 visual magnitudes @xmath44 mag , with @xmath45 of the stars in the @xmath46 mag range .",
    "we have used the vizier service and additional software of our own to cross - correlate the entire list with the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite and obtain infrared @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 magnitudes for all the stars ( a 10@xmath4 search radius was used , and proper motions taken into account ; most counterparts were recovered within 2@xmath4 of their extrapolated position ) .",
    "the first selection cut selects for stars which have a proper motion vector whose orientation is consistent with bpmg membership .",
    "we adopt as the fiducial space motion of the bpmg the mean motion of its known members , estimated by @xcite to be @xmath50 km s@xmath7 relative to the sun .",
    "we apply eq .  3 , and select tycho-2 stars whose proper motion vector makes an angle @xmath51 with the local projected bpmg motion vector ( @xmath27=0.978 ) .",
    "this reduces the sample to 15,989 stars ( 18.4% of the initial sample ) whose proper motion vector is aligned with the local projected motion of the bpmg .",
    "their distribution on the sky is shown in figure 1 ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
    "the distribution shows a dipolar moment , whose axis is aligned along the apex of the bpmg motion .    we have compared our list of proper motion selected objects to the 51 known members of the bpmg listed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that we recover 30 of the known members .",
    "of the 22 stars that are not recovered , we find nine stars that are too faint to be listed in the tycho-2 catalog ( 8 of them being faint companions of recovered group members ) .",
    "ten other stars have proper motions smaller than the proper motion limit of our initial sample ( @xmath6 mas yr@xmath7 ) and thus could also not possibly have been recovered .",
    "the two remaining stars are bright high proper motion stars which are listed in the _ hipparcos _ catalog but , for some reason , are missing from the tycho-2 .",
    "all stars being accounted for , we then find our proper motion selection algorithm to have a recovery rate of 100% .",
    "this suggests that any unrecognized groups member that is present in the initial sample will be selected in the proper motion cut .",
    "the 30 recovered members are listed in table 1 , and their location on the sky is indicated in figure 1 with solid triangles .",
    "a majority of the members are located in the southern sky , with a concentration around @xmath52 ) .",
    "however this moving group extends over a broad swath of the sky , and even has a few members north of the celestial equator .",
    "it even is possible that the sun could be situated within the confines of the group .",
    "hence , any of the @xmath53 other stars could potentially be a @xmath0 pictoris member , regardless of its position on the sky .",
    "the largest reduction in the number of possible bpmg candidates is achieved through kinematic distance selection . based on data from the _ hipparcos _ catalog",
    ", we calculate that the median transverse velocity of stars with proper motion @xmath6 mas yr@xmath7 is @xmath54 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the mean motion of the bpmg is only @xmath55 km s@xmath7 , which means that field stars are moving faster on average , and thus @xmath56 will tend to underestimate their distances , making field stars appear underluminous .",
    "figure 2 shows the color - magnitude diagram for all 15,989 tycho-2 stars identified as possible members , with @xmath33 used to calculate a pseudo absolute magnitude .",
    "the figure reveals that known group members occupy a distinct locus in this color - magnitude diagram , with most members following a relatively well defined color - magnitude relationship .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the calculated @xmath33 should be very close to the actual distance @xmath29 to those stars .",
    "we find that one can model the mean locus of the bpmg members with @xmath57 with all members but one falling within @xmath58 mag of this line .",
    "as expected , the vast majority of stars in the overall sample do not cluster along the line defined in eq.9 , but appear significantly underluminous in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "nonmembers may fall off the well - defined locus of the group members for two main reasons : ( 1 ) their calculated @xmath33 either underestimate or overestimate their true distance , and/or ( 2 ) the stars are significantly older than bpmg members , and do not follow the same color - magnitude relationship as the young bpmg stars . from figure 2 , we see that most stars fall well below the standard color - magnitude relationship of bpmg members , most probably because @xmath33 significantly underestimate their true distance .",
    "all these background stars can be efficiently eliminated from the list of prospective candidates .",
    "we find that of the initial 15,962 prospective members , only 835 fall within @xmath58 mag of the mean color - magnitude relationship of bpmg members .",
    "this reduces the list of possible candidates by a factor of 20 .",
    "the much reduced subsample , however , remains contaminated by a significant number of background giants which are easily identified in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "these appear to be red clump k giants , with optical - infrared colors 2@xmath593 . in figure 2 , they show up as a nearly vertical band of stars extending all the way up the diagram .",
    "these stars are a serious source of contaminants , however they occupy a fairly narrow range of colors . since we are mostly interested in identifying the elusive low - mass members of the bpmg , we can further restrict our search to stars with very red colors , thus eliminating most of those k giants .",
    "we introduce @xmath60 as additional color cut ( dashed line in figure 2 .",
    "this further reduces the sample to a short list of 55 probable _ low - mass _ bpmg members .",
    "such a sample is of a size very much manageable for follow - up spectroscopic programs .",
    "a search of the literature reveals that four of the 55 candidates are actually known members of the tw hya association ( twa ) .",
    "the reason for their presence among bpmg candidates is due to the fact that the twa mean motion vector @xmath61 km s@xmath7 @xcite is very close to the mean motion vector of the bpmg @xmath62 km s@xmath7 @xcite . in many directions on the sky ,",
    "the two associations run nearly parallel to each other , which makes confusion possible .",
    "both groups also contain young stars , and occupy similar loci in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the four twa interlopers are listed in table 1 .    of the 51 remaining candidates",
    ", we proceeded to investigate further 33 objects which were within range for our follow - up spectroscopic observations ( see below ) .",
    "this short list of 33 candidates is provided in table 2 .",
    "follow - up observations are now being planned for the remaining 18 targets , which will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "table 2 compiles data on the 33 candidates followed up in this paper .",
    "the table lists the tycho-2 catalog ( tyc ) identifier , hip numbers for stars listed in the _ hipparcos _ catalog , coordinates in the icrs system , proper motions , tycho-2 visual magnitude v@xmath63 and 2mass infrared k@xmath64 magnitude .",
    "the table also lists the predicted distances assuming bpmg membership ( @xmath33 , based on the proper motion ) .",
    "though parallaxes are not generally available for stars in the tycho-2 catalog , most of the brighter ( v@xmath65 ) entries are also _ hipparcos _ stars , and accurate parallaxes exist for them . in tables 1 and 2 ,",
    "we identify all the _ hipparcos _ objects by their catalog number , and provide distances ( d@xmath66 ) based on their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes as obtained from the recent new reduction of @xcite .",
    "distances derived from these parallaxes are also tabulated ; they are generally accurate to @xmath671 - 2 parsecs , though a few have large uncertainties , including tyc 689 - 130 - 3 ( = [ rhg95]853 , = lp 476 - 207 ) whose estimated distance is 33.2@xmath6710.5 pc . additionally ,",
    "the parallax to bd+28@xmath68382b , the resolved companion to hd 14082 , is clearly overestimated in the @xcite catalog , as it is quoted to be 36.58@xmath675.83 mas , compared with 28.97@xmath672.88 mas for hd 14082 .",
    "figure 3 plots d@xmath66 against the kinematic distance d@xmath69 , calculated from the proper motion assuming all stars to be moving with the mean motion of the @xmath0-pictoris moving group ( equation 6 ) .",
    "we provide uncertainties on d@xmath70 which are based on the uncertainties in the tycho-2 proper motions .",
    "the relative errors on the proper motions are systematically smaller than those on the parallaxes , which yield smaller errors on d@xmath70 than on d@xmath66 .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the d@xmath71 assume the stars to be moving exactly at the mean motion of the group , which may not be strictly accurate because group members have some dispersion about the mean velocity .",
    "we find that all confirmed bpmg members have d@xmath66 within 20% of d@xmath70 .",
    "the small scatter is due to parallax and proper motion accuracies , but also to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of individual group members which is unaccounted in d@xmath70 .    of the 33 bpmg candidates , we find seven _ hipparcos",
    "_ stars whose parallax distances ( d@xmath66 ) are significantly different from the predicted kinematic distances ( d@xmath70 ) ; this eliminates them as possible group members .",
    "six have d@xmath70 overestimating their true distance ; these must be background stars with transverse velocities larger than the bpmg .",
    "the other star has d@xmath70 underestimating its true distance , in this case the star must be a foreground object moving slower than the bpmg . with those eliminated from the sample ,",
    "our follow - up observations have focused on the remaining 26 candidates .",
    "we searched for counterparts to the bpmg candidates in the _ rosat _ x - ray catalogs , both the _ rosat _ all - sky bright source catalog of @xcite , and the _ rosat _ all - sky survey faint source catalog @xcite .",
    "we also searched for counterparts to the known bpmg members . according to @xcite , the positional accuracy of the _ rosat _ catalog for point sources is 13@xmath4 , 90% of the time , with some outliers possibly having errors as large as 40@xmath4 . to make sure we did not overlook possible x - ray counterparts ,",
    "we have examined all _ rosat _ sources within 50@xmath4 of our bpmg candidates .",
    "we found possible x - ray counterparts for 22 of the known bpmg members , and also to all four of the tw hya association interlopers .",
    "we further found counterparts to six of the bpmg candidates .",
    "of the 32 possible x - ray counterparts , 25 have _ rosat _ positions placing them within 15@xmath4 of the tycho-2 star , and are thus convincing matches .",
    "the other seven sources have large offsets , and were investigated further .",
    "a counterpart to tyc 6412 - 1068 - 1 ( = hd 203 ) , the source 1rx j000648.9 - 230608 , is found with an offset of 24@xmath4 .",
    "an examination of scans from the digitized sky surveys ( dss ) and from 2mass did not reveal any optical of infrared source within 15@xmath4 of the quoted _ rosat _ position .",
    "furthermore , the _ rosat _ catalog reports a positional error of 19@xmath4 for that x - ray source .",
    "given the larger positional error and the absence of any alternative , we conclude that 1rx j000648.9 - 230608 is an actual counterpart of tyc 6412 - 1068 - 1 ( = hd 203 ) .",
    "likewise the _ rosat _ sources 1rxs j184523.4 - 645201 and 1rxs j184657.3 - 621037 were found to be near the stars tyc 9077 - 2487 - 1 ( = hd 172555 ) and tyc 9073 - 762 - 1 , with offsets of only 26@xmath4 and 33@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the two sources are quoted to have _ rosat _ positional errors of 21@xmath4 and 24@xmath4 , and we could not find any other possible match to an optical or infrared source .",
    "we thus identify these sources as the actual x - ray counterparts to tyc 9077 - 2487 - 1 and tyc 9073 - 762 - 1 .",
    "the star tyc 7760 - 283 - 1 has a possible x - ray counterpart ( 1rxs j121527.9 - 394843 ) whose _ rosat _ position is 33@xmath4 from the tycho-2 position .",
    "the quoted _ rosat _ positional uncertainty is 14@xmath4 , which would suggest the x - ray source is not a match .",
    "however , examination of the dss and 2mass reveals no other possible optical counterpart .",
    "because the hardness ratios are consistent with the other bpmg and tw hya association members , we assume the x - ray source to be a match , although more accurate x - ray astrometry would have to confirm this . among the new bpmg candidates",
    ", we found the star tyc 643 - 73 - 1 to have an associated x - ray source ( 1rxs j024419.4 + 105707 ) with a _",
    "position off by 45@xmath4 .",
    "again the positional uncertainty quoted in the _ rosat _ catalog is relatively large ( 43@xmath4 ) and we thus conclude that the two are the same object ; no other possible counterpart can be seen in the dss and 2mass images .",
    "the x - ray count rates of all identified counterparts are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we also give the two _ rosat _ hardness ratios @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    finally , the star tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 is found to be 26@xmath4 from a _ rosat _ source ( 1rxs j195602.8 - 320720 ) which has a quoted positional accuracy of only 9@xmath4 .",
    "the source is however not a counterpart to tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 .",
    "a close examination of the dss images reveals that the x - ray source is a near - perfect match to a nearby , fainter star .",
    "interestingly , a search of the usno - b1.0 reveals that this star has a proper motion [ @xmath74=[30,-78 ] mas yr@xmath7 which is nearly coincident with the proper motion of tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 , [ @xmath74=[30,-66 ] .",

    "based on the usno - b astrometry , the companion is at an angular separation @xmath75=26@xmath4.3 from tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 , with a position angle @xmath76=316.5 degrees .",
    "assuming tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 to be a member of the bpmg , the kinematic distance of 45.6@xmath671.6 parsecs suggests a wide binary with projected orbital separation of 1,200@xmath6742 au .    to summarize",
    ", we find that the majority ( 21 of 30 ) of the known bpmg members have x - ray counterparts in the _ rosat _ catalogs , which indicates chromospheric activity consistent with their young ages .",
    "likewise , all four twa interlopers have bright associated _ rosat _ counterparts .",
    "on the other hand , we find x - ray counterparts for only seven of the 33 candidates under investigation ( table 2 ) .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of the candidates are not young / active and are thus not genuine bpmg members but field stars with projected motions aligned with the projected bpmg velocity vector .",
    "interestingly , the counterparts of the bpmg candidates have hardness ratios consistent with those of moderately young stars in nearby moving groups . the counterparts are distributed on a locus which coincides roughly with the locus of the known bpmg members ( figure 4 ) .",
    "all of them in turn have hardness ratios intermediate between those of extremely young t tauri stars , and those of the older field k and m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this suggests that bpmg candidates with x - ray counterparts are likely to be nearby stars of relatively young ages , whether or not they are actual bpmg members .    because some of the known bpmg members also do not have counterparts in _ rosat _ , we find that the absence of a _ rosat _ counterpart is not sufficient to justify rejection .",

    "more recently , the star was observed as part of the superwasp wide field photometric survey , and discovered to be periodically variable @xcite .",
    "the star is cataloged under the name 1swasp j002334.66 + 201428.6 , and is found to be variable at the 2%-3% level with a period of 7.9 days .",
    "such variation is consistent with rotational modulation .",

    "the predicted distance is similar to that of tyc 1186 - 706 - 1 , but the two stars are in very different directions on the sky ( see figure 1 ) and must be physically unrelated .",
    "tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 does not have any previous mention in the literature . however , the common proper motion companion identified while searching for x - ray counterparts ( see section 4.2 above ) is , of course , the known x - ray source j195602.8 - 320720 @xcite .",

    "the star is cataloged under the name 1swasp j220041.59 + 271513.5 , and was observed to be variable at the 2% level , with a period of 0.52 days .",
    "this behavior suggests rotational modulation in a fast rotator , and is consistent with the high value of @xmath85 we infer for the rotational velocity . an early m - type star with a rotation period of 0.5 days , having a radius of about 0.5 r@xmath90 @xcite , would be expected to have a rotation velocity at the equator of 50 km s@xmath7 , consistent with our inferred value of @xmath85 = 30 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we have presented an algorithm to identify probable members of any known nearby moving group from large catalogs of proper motion stars .",
    "the technique identifies prospective members based on the orientation of their proper motion vector , which aligns with the projected motion of the group in the plane of the sky , and uses the magnitude of the proper motion to estimate a distance of the assumption of group membership . that predicted distance is used to verify consistency with the known color - magnitude relationship of the group .",
    "we have tested the method by conducting a search for possible members of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group in a subsample of high proper motion stars @xmath6 mas@xmath7 from the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "a subset of 31 candidates was investigated for signs of youth , including low - resolution spectroscopy to look for h@xmath2 lines in emission , and a search for x - ray counterparts in the _ rosat _ catalogs .",
    "twelve stars showing possible evidence for youth were targeted for high - resolution infrared spectroscopy , in order to corroborate moving group membership from their radial velocities .",
    "three of the stars are found to be convincing new members of the bpmg , these are tyc 1186 - 706 - 1 , tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 , and tyc 2211 - 1309 - 1 .",
    "the star tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 is also found to have a common proper motion companion , with an angular separation of 26@xmath4 , which is most probably a wide companion with a projected separation @xmath881,200 au .",
    "we believe that the method can be successfully expanded to the identification of members from any other moving group and association . the use of a deeper proper motion catalog , such as the recent ppm - extended ( ppmx ) catalog @xcite , which extends to v=15 mag , or the superblink database @xcite that is statistically complete to v=19 mag , should allow for the identification of most low - mass members of these moving groups , at least down to the hydrogen burning limit .",
