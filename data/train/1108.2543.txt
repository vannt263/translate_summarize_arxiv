    "molecular clouds ( mcs ) undergo a highly non - linear fragmentation process , even prior to the emergence of young stars , or in regions with no apparent star formation .",
    "the fundamental reason for their fragmentation is the presence of supersonic turbulence that originates at large scales from various sources , such as supernovae , spiral - arm shocks , or magneto - rotational instability .",
    "the formation of dense filaments and cores is the natural evolution of the intersection of randomly driven shocks in the turbulent flow . even without self - gravity , turbulence simulations with the same rms mach numbers as mcs generate density contrasts of many orders of magnitude , with characteristic size and density of both filaments and cores as observed in mcs @xcite . because all stars are born in mcs , and specifically from dense cores found predominantly within the densest filaments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fragmentation by the turbulence must control the early phases of the star formation process .",
    "it may also control its global properties , such as the star formation rate @xcite and the mass distribution of stars @xcite , but other processes ( e.g. stellar jets and outflows , disk fragmentation , competitive accretion , ambipolar drift ) can also affect the mass and formation rate of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most ( sub-)mm or extinction surveys of star - forming regions have resulted in prestellar core mass functions ( cmfs ) interpreted to be consistent with the stellar imf @xcite . a few studies have also claimed the detection of a cmf peak , which has been interpreted as a scaled progenitor of the stellar imf peak , with the scaling mass factor giving the local efficiency of star formation @xcite .",
    "however , the peak of the cmf is quite close to the estimated completeness limits of the surveys , which depends also on the core shape and selection method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simple theoretical considerations show that a one - to - one relation between the mass of observed prestellar cores and that of stars is unlikely .",
    "prestellar cores must grow for some time before they can collapse and form stars . when a core is observed it is unlikely to have just reached its final mass .",
    "furthermore , the largest observable mass of a core may be even lower than the full prestellar mass involved .",
    "once a core mass grows beyond its bonnor - ebert ( be ) mass @xcite , the core rapidly collapses within about a free - fall time , but the accretion flow that was assembling that core is likely to still be active , and to continue to bring additional mass to the new protostar .",
    "the prestellar core as such is gone , but the prestellar mass feeding the new protostar may keep coming . note that this process is essentially _ inertial _ , and therefore distinctly different from _ competitive _ accretion , which assumes the flow is caused by gravitation forces .",
    "@xcite have stressed a timescale problem in relating the cmf to the stellar imf : if cores of different masses are assumed to all contain one be mass , small cores must be denser and free - fall more rapidly than larger ones .",
    "if the cmf is stationary in time , the corresponding stellar imf should then be steeper than the cmf .",
    "however , the observations do not show a strong correlation between core mass and density , so this timescale issue may not be the main problem in deriving the imf from the cmf . in this letter",
    ", we study the relation between the cmf and the stellar imf based on our imf model @xcite .",
    "the imf model by @xcite ( pn02 hereafter ) predicts the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores generated by a turbulent flow . the mass of a core is the total mass , @xmath1 , the turbulent flow would assemble locally , irrespective of when the core should collapse and cease to appear as prestellar . in pn02 ,",
    "the mass distribution of all cores ( unstable or not ) is a power law with slope @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the slope of the velocity power spectrum of the turbulent flow , @xmath4 .",
    "the salpeter slope , @xmath5 , is thus recovered if @xmath6 , consistent with power spectra derived from the largest simulations of supersonic and super - alfvnic turbulence and from observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unstable cores are then selected as those more massive than their be mass , assuming all cores have the same temperature , while their external density ( the local postshock density ) follows the log - normal pdf of supersonic turbulent flows .",
    "most of the massive cores contain more than one be mass , so the imf above approximately one solar mass is predicted to be a power law with slope close to salpeter s .",
    "smaller cores are usually less massive than their be mass , so the imf is expected to peak at a fraction of a solar mass , and to decline towards smaller masses .",
    "this assumes that the actual stellar mass is @xmath7 , and the local efficiency , @xmath8 , is approximately independent of mass . in observational studies ,",
    "the local efficiency , @xmath9 , is instead defined as the ratio of the resulting stellar mass , @xmath10 , and the current mass of prestellar cores , @xmath11 , so @xmath12 .",
    "it follows that the ratio of the total core mass predicted by the model and the current core mass can be expressed as the ratio between our theoretical local efficiency and the observational one , @xmath13 , and thus @xmath14 .    to create a population of observable prestellar cores consistent with the imf model , we first generate random values of total core masses , @xmath1 , following the predicted power law distribution with slope @xmath5",
    "we then generate a random value of external density for each core , according to the log - normal gas density distribution of the turbulent flow , converted to mass fraction , @xmath15 d\\tilde{\\rho } , \\label{pdf } \\vspace{0.2cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the core external density in units of the cloud mean density , @xmath17 , and the standard deviation , @xmath18 , of the logarithmic density field is @xmath19 , \\label{eq_sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the rms sonic mach number , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the three - dimensional rms velocity and @xmath23 the isothermal sound speed corresponding to the mean temperature @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a characteristic ratio of gas to magnetic pressure in the postshock gas ( see * ? ? ?",

    "assuming that the postshock thickness , @xmath28 , grows linearly with time , we can then model the mass evolution of a prestellar core , up to the time @xmath38 , when the total core mass , @xmath1 , is reached , with the simple law @xmath39 which shows that cores must spend a significant fraction of their lifetime at a mass significantly lower than their final mass , and therefore the relation between the masses of prestellar cores and stars can not be trivial .    in order to express @xmath40 and @xmath11 as a function of @xmath1 , instead of @xmath31 , we can relate @xmath1 and @xmath31 using equation  ( [ m_star ] ) with the shock jump conditions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , assuming that the shock alfvnic mach number scales like the shock velocity , @xmath43 , and with the effective rms alfvnic mach number expression of @xcite ( equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , @xmath44 .",
