    "superconductivity and ferromagnetism are two competing orders : while the former `` prefers '' an antiparallel spin orientation of electrons in cooper pairs , the latter forces the spins to align in parallel .",
    "therefore , their coexistence in one and the same material is possible only in a narrow interval of parameters ; hence the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism is most conveniently studied when the two interactions are spatially separated . in this case",
    "the coexistence of the two orders is due to the proximity effect .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to properties of hybrid proximity systems containing superconductors ( s ) and ferromagnets ( f ) ; new physical phenomena were observed and predicted in these systems.@xcite one of the most striking effects in sf layered structures is highly nonmonotonic dependence of their critical temperature @xmath0 on the thickness @xmath1 of the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "experiments exploring this nonmonotonic behavior were performed previously on sf multilayers such as nb / gd,@xcite nb / fe,@xcite v / v - fe,@xcite and pb / fe,@xcite but the results ( and , in particular , the comparison between the experiments and theories ) were not conclusive .    to perform reliable experimental measurements of @xmath2 ,",
    "it is essential to have @xmath1 large compared to the interatomic distance ; this situation can be achieved only in the limit of weak ferromagnets .",
    "active experimental investigations of sf bilayers and multilayers based on cu - ni dilute ferromagnetic alloys are carried out by several groups.@xcite in sf bilayers , they observed nonmonotonic dependence @xmath2 .",
    "while the reason for this effect in multilayers can be the @xmath3@xmath4 transition,@xcite in a bilayer system with a single superconductor this mechanism is irrelevant , and the cause of the effect is interference of quasiparticle , specific to sf structures .    in the present paper , motivated by the experiments of refs .",
    "we theoretically study the critical temperature of sf bilayers .",
    "previous theoretical investigations of @xmath0 in sf structures were concentrated on systems with thin or thick layers ( compared to the corresponding coherence lengths ) ; with sf boundaries having very low or very high transparencies ; the exchange energy was often assumed to be much larger than the critical temperature ; in addition , the methods for solving the problem were usually approximate.@xcite the parameters of the experiments of refs",

    "we develop two approaches giving the opportunity to investigate not only the limiting cases of parameters but also the intermediate region . using our methods",

    "a number of methods can be used for calculating @xmath0 . when the critical temperature of the structure is close to the critical temperature @xmath5 of the superconductor without the ferromagnetic layer , the ginzburg ",
    "landau ( gl ) theory applies .",
    "however , @xmath0 of sf bilayers may significantly deviate from @xmath5 , therefore we choose a more general theory valid at arbitrary temperature  the quasiclassical approach.@xcite near @xmath0 the quasiclassical equations become linear . in the literature",
    "the emerging problem is often treated with the help of the so - called `` single - mode '' approximation,@xcite which is argued to be qualitatively reasonable in a wide region of parameters .",
    "however , this method is justified only in a specific region of parameters which we find below . moreover , below we show examples when this method fails even qualitatively .",

    "below we present our arguments .",
    "we give a brief derivation of the usadel equations showing how the complex diffusion constant can be obtained and why this result can not be trusted . in the `` quasi - one - dimensional '' geometry ( which means that the parameters vary only as a function of @xmath117 ) the linearized eilenberger equation in the presence of disorder and the exchange field has the form @xmath140 where , for simplicity , we assume a positive matsubara frequency @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is the angle between the @xmath117 axis and the direction of the fermi velocity @xmath143 , while @xmath144 denotes angular averaging over the spherical angles .",
    "the disorder is characterized by the time of the mean free path @xmath114 and the mean free path @xmath145 ( to be used below ) . in the dirty limit the anomalous green function @xmath9 is nearly isotropic .",
    "however , to obtain the usadel equation for the isotropic part of @xmath9 , we must also take into account the next term from the full legendre polynomial expansion : @xmath146 here we have neglected the harmonics with @xmath147 assuming them small ; we shall check this assumption later .",

    "( [ eilenberger ] ) over the spherical angles first directly and second  after being multiplied by @xmath148 , we arrive at @xmath149 equation ( [ aux ] ) yields @xmath150 then eq .

    "( [ f_1 ] ) we obtain @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the characteristic space scale on which @xmath156 varies .",
    "according to the usadel equation ( [ usadel ] ) , it is given by @xmath157 and the condition of the usadel equation s validity is written as @xmath158 [ similarly , we can also keep the term with @xmath159 in series ( [ legendre ] ) , which yields @xmath160 ) takes the form @xmath161 ( we have taken into account that the characteristic energy is @xmath162 ) .",
    "now we can analyze our results .",
    "if condition ( [ condition_final ] ) is satisfied and the usadel equation is valid , the neglected angular harmonics have the relative order of magnitude @xmath163 ; hence we can not retain the terms of the same order in the diffusion constant [ see eq .",

    "in the present paper we have developed two methods for calculating the critical temperature of a sf bilayer as a function of its parameters ( the thicknesses and material parameters of the layers , the quality of the interface ) .",
    "the multi - mode method is a generalization of the corresponding approach developed in ref .   for sn systems .",
    "however , the rigorous justification of this method is not clear .",
    "therefore , we propose yet another approach  the method of fundamental solution , which is mathematically rigorous .",
    "the results demonstrate that the two methods are equivalent ; however , at low temperatures ( compared to @xmath5 ) the accuracy requirements are stricter for the multi - mode method , and the method of fundamental solution is preferable . comparing our method with experiment we obtain good agreement .    in the general case ,",
    "we observe three characteristic types of @xmath2 behavior : 1 )  nonmonotonic decay of @xmath0 to a finite value exhibiting a minimum at particular @xmath1 , 2 )  reentrant behavior , characterized by vanishing of @xmath0 in a certain interval of @xmath1 and finite values otherwise , 3 )  monotonic decay of @xmath0 and vanishing at finite @xmath1 .",
    "qualitatively , the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath2 is explained by interference of quasiparticles in the f layer , which can be either constructive or destructive depending on the value of @xmath1 .    using the developed methods we have checked the accuracy of the widely used single - mode approximation .",
    "we conclude that although at some parameters the results of the single - mode and exact methods are close , in the general case they are quantitatively and even qualitatively different .",
    "thus , to obtain reliable results one should use one of the exact ( multi - mode or fundamental - solution ) techniques .    the spatial dependence of the order parameter ( at the transition point ) is shown to be almost insensitive to the value of @xmath0 .    the methods developed and the results obtained in this paper apply directly to more complicated symmetric multilayered structures in the @xmath3-state such as sfs and fsf trilayers , sfifs and fsisf systems , and sf superlattices .",
    "our methods can be generalized to take account of possible superconductive and/or magnetic @xmath4-states ( when @xmath11 and/or @xmath96 may change their signs from layer to layer ) .",
