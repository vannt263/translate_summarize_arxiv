    "the past decade has witnessed drastic increase of wireless data traffic , largely due to the so - called `` smartphone revolution . '' as wireless data traffic is explosively increasing , the capacity of existing and future wireless networks will be greatly stressed .",
    "many advanced wireless communication technologies , such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) and multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) , are widely adopted to enhance the system capacity , while a huge amount of wireless access networks / base stations ( bs ) are deployed every year to accommodate the compelling need for larger capacity . given the increasing wireless data volume and the more and more crowded bs deployment , interference is becoming the major factor that limits wireless network performance .",
    "traditionally , interference is considered harmful and often treated as background noise .",
    "as the performance of point - to - point transmission techniques is approaching shannon capacity , there is now considerable interest on exploiting interference for further capacity gains .",
    "it is shown that when interference is large , it can be decoded and canceled from the mixed signal ( as in interference cancellation ) , while when interference is comparable , interference alignment can be adopted to enable concurrent transmissions . although interference is harmful in many cases , it could be beneficial for enhancing system throughput as long as the interference can be aligned .",

    "interference alignment was first proposed in  @xcite , and the feasibility condition was investigated in  @xcite . since in a large network , there are many users but limited dimensionality , the authors in  @xcite proposed the concept of `` best - effort '' interference alignment , and adopted an iterative algorithm to optimize it .",

    "interested reader are referred to  @xcite and the references therein for details .      with the single antenna transmission technique being well developed",
    ", it is natural to extend to multiple antenna systems .",

    "generally speaking , multiple antennas or an antenna array can be used to attain the _ diversity gain _ , _ multiplexing gain _ , or _",

    "the maximum multiplexing gain is known to be @xmath25 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume that channel state information is perfectly known at each transmitter and receiver as in prior works  @xcite .    [ !",
    "t ]      it is shown in  @xcite that in a @xmath0 user wireless network , with @xmath26 symbol extensions , totally @xmath27 normalized _ degrees of freedom _",
    "( dof ) can be achieved using interference alignment , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in single antenna systems ,",
    "the normalized dof is 1 . with interference alignment ,",
    "the system throughput is enhanced by a factor of @xmath27 for @xmath30 .",
    "note that there is no interference if there is only one user occupying the time or frequency resource .",
    "_ observation 1 _ : the system throughput could be improved if alignable interference is introduced among users .",
    "this observation is useful for ofdm systems , where the channel gain matrix is diagonal .",
    "since the gain of interference alignment is proportional to @xmath0 , we should have more users transmit at the same time slot or frequency band if the transmitted vectors can be aligned .",
    "that is why we call this kind of interference _ beneficial interference _ in this paper .",
    "in this section , we investigate the problem of interference alignment in multi - user ofdm systems .",
    "the system model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mimoofdm1 ] .",
    "we first examine fundamental characteristics and practical constraints , and then demonstrate how to exploit interference in multi - user ofdm systems .",
    "we derive the maximum throughput when interference alignment is adopted , as well as closed - form precoding and decoding matrices to achieve the maximum throughput .      in traditional interference alignment ,",
    "deploying multiple transmitting antennas allows us to precode data packets and align them at the receiver .",
    "deploying multiple receiving antennas provides multidimensional signal space , so that interference can be aligned into a sub - signal space that is orthogonal to the desired signal .",
    "therefore , deploying multiple antennas can provide the needed freedom in the signal space .    in ofdm systems , we observe that subcarriers can function in similar ways as antennas in mimo / interference alignment systems , since subcarriers could also provide multidimensional signal space . to some extent",
    ", subcarriers can be regarded as a counterpart of antennas .",
    "so we could compress the interference at each receiver in no more than half of the subcarriers , and leave the other half subcarriers free from interference .",
    "however , note that there is a distinguishing difference between the two systems : there is no cross - talk among different subcarriers in ofdm .",
    "the main idea of interference alignment is to compress the interference space to no more than half of the total received signal space at each receiver , leaving the remaining part of the space for desired signals  @xcite .",
    "this goal is achieved through precoding at every transmitter and zero forcing interference cancellation at every receiver .    in ofdm systems ,",
    "data is transmitted over multiple carriers between transmitters and receivers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mimoofdm1 ] . since in ofdm systems",
    ", subcarriers can also provide multidimensional signal space for the transmitter and receiver as multiple antennas , we could precode over multiple subcarriers to achieve interference alignment for ofdm system as multiple antennas for mimo system .",
    "suppose there are @xmath1 subcarriers .",
    "ignoring noise , if there is no precoding , the received signal for each receiver @xmath31 is an @xmath32 vector given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the desired signal in the form of an @xmath32 vector , and @xmath3 is the @xmath35 channel gain matrix between the transmitter and receiver .",
    "since different subcarriers have different frequencies , the channel gain matrix is _ diagonal _ if there is no severe frequency shift .",
    "it can be seen from later discussions that this property makes interference alignment in ofdm system quite different from the general channel case .",
    "going one step further , we can precode the data before transmission .",
    "if @xmath36 packets are to be transmitted in an @xmath1 subcarrier ofdm system , an @xmath37 _ precoding matrix _ @xmath17 could be used .",
    "the system equation is rewritten as follows .",
    "@xmath38 if we let @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an @xmath42 identity matrix ,  ( [ eq : ofdm2 ] ) is reduced to  ( [ eq : ofdm1 ] ) .",
    "in general , we could control what to be transmitted on the subcarriers by adjusting the precoding matrix accordingly .",
    "for a single user single antenna ofdm system with @xmath1 subcarriers , the maximum number of packets can be transmitted is @xmath1 .",
    "note that , here @xmath1 is normalized by the qam ( quadrature amplitude modulation ) modulation level .",
    "however , inspired by the idea of interference alignment , we show that a throughput higher than @xmath1 can be achieved in the following subsections .",
    "as discussed , we consider the problem of interference alignment in multiuser ofdm systems .",
    "basically , we aim to answer the following questions .    1 .",
    "what are the practical constraints for adopting interference alignment in such systems ? 2 .   what is the maximum throughput that can be achieved ? 3",
    "how to achieve the maximum throughput ( i.e. , deriving closed - form precoding and decoding matrices ) ?      in this section , we show the difference on applying interference alignment between a diagonal channel and a general channel , as well as the challenges to adopt interference alignment in the former case .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that given @xmath23 transmitting antennas and @xmath24 receiving antennas in a @xmath0 user interference channel , the dof for each user , denoted by @xmath36 , must satisfy @xmath43 for example , given two transmitting and receiving antennas in a three - user interference channel ,  ( [ eq : muofdmia97 ] ) indicates that each user could transmit one packet simultaneously . with a generic structureless channel ,",
    "the throughput @xmath44 can be achieved as follows .    at each receiver",
    ", we align the signals from the other two users .",
    "recall the channel gain matrices as defined in  ( [ eq : cgain ] ) and let the user @xmath9 signal be @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 solving ( [ eq : muofdmia98 ] ) , ( [ eq : muofdmia99 ] ) and ( [ eq : muofdmia100 ] ) , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the eigenvector of matrix @xmath50 .",
    "this scheme works well for generic structureless channels , but not for the case of diagonal channels .",
    "for instance , if 2 subcarriers ( instead of two antennas ) are used in ofdm , all the channel gain matrices in ( [ eq : muofdmia88 ] ) , ( [ eq : muofdmia87 ] ) and ( [ eq : muofdmia86 ] ) are diagonal . since the product of diagonal matrices is still diagonal , we have from ( [ eq : muofdmia88 ] ) that @xmath51 if @xmath52^t$ ] , we derive @xmath53^t$ ] from ( [ eq : muofdmia87 ] ) and @xmath54^t$ ] from ( [ eq : muofdmia86 ] ) , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are scalars . to cancel the interference at receiver @xmath19 , the _ cancellation vector _",
    "@xmath57 must be @xmath58^t$ ] , where @xmath59 is also a scalar .",
    "however , the desired packet is also canceled since @xmath57 is orthogonal to @xmath60 . therefore , we can not simultaneously transmit @xmath61 packets in this system .",
    "the reason behind is that for a diagonal channel , its eigenvectors have only one nonzero entry .",
    "if we align interferences at receiver @xmath62 by letting @xmath63 , for @xmath64 , the precoding vectors are dependent to each other .",
    "consequently , when interference is canceled at a receiver , the desired packet will also be canceled .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that in a @xmath0 user system with @xmath26 symbol extensions , totally @xmath27 normalized dof can be achieved using interference alignment , where @xmath28 and @xmath65 . in light of this result , one may think that @xmath2 concurrent transmissions is achievable in a @xmath0-user , @xmath1 subcarrier ofdm system .",
    "however , we will show that this is unachievable for large @xmath0 in practical systems in the following .",
    "it is worth noting that an assumption made in  @xcite is that the symbol extensions can be infinitely large .",
    "this assumption may not hold true in practical systems . given a finite bandwidth ,",
    "the number of subcarriers is the bandwidth divided by the subcarrier spacing . typically , the value of subcarrier spacing is @xmath66 khz . then even for a 100 mhz bandwidth , we can have at most @xmath67 subcarriers .",
    "for instance , in 802.16 m and lte , the maximum number of ifft is 2,048 , and maximum number of effective subcarriers is 1,200 .",
    "therefore , the problem is to maximize system throughput given a finite number of subcarriers , denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that with @xmath26 symbol extensions , the total normalized dof is @xmath69 / [ ( n+1)^q+n^q]$ ] .",
    "so we aim to maximize @xmath70 and have the following formulation .",
    "@xmath71 the physical meaning of problem ( [ eq : mimoofdmmax ] ) is that we try to maximize the unnormalized dof given finite number of subcarriers .",
    "note that all the variables are integers .",
    "constraint  ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) indicates that for practical ofdm systems , the number of subcarriers @xmath72 is upper bounded by @xmath68 .",
    "although this integer programming problem is np - hard in general , by careful inspection , we can find the solution under practical constraints .",
    "in particular , we find the feasible region is very small for practical @xmath68 values . also the objective value is monotone with respect to the two variables @xmath73 and @xmath0 . in problem ( [ eq : mimoofdmmax ] ) , assuming @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 from ( [ eq : constraint1 ] ) . for each value of @xmath73",
    ", we can derive the number of subcarriers needed , @xmath68 , from ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) for the problem to be feasible , as well as the throughput of the system ( i.e. , the objective value of ( [ eq : mimoofdmmax ] ) ) .",
    "the corresponding degree of freedom , @xmath36 , is the ratio of the throughput and the number of subcarriers required .",
    "these numbers are presented in table  [ tab : efficiencies ] .",
    "table  [ tab : efficiencies ] shows that if there are @xmath74 users , @xmath76 and @xmath77 subcarriers are needed when @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . as discussed , a practical system usually do not have more than @xmath67 subcarriers . so @xmath73 can only be @xmath19 in this case , with efficiency @xmath80 . therefore , interference alignment is not useful in this case , since we can simply allow only one user to transmit over one time - slot or a particular frequency band to get @xmath81 ( i.e. , single user ofdm ) .",
    "if there are @xmath82 transmitters , we have @xmath83 .",
    "even if @xmath78 , the number of subcarriers needed is @xmath84 , which is not feasible for practical systems .",
    "since the number of subcarriers @xmath85 grows exponentially with @xmath86 , it can be readily concluded that @xmath0 can not be more than 4 for interference alignment to be beneficial in multi - user ofdm systems .",
    "since the objective value of ( [ eq : mimoofdmmax ] ) is an monotone increasing function of @xmath0 , the maximum feasible value @xmath87 is of particular interest .",
    "we have @xmath88 when @xmath87 .",
    "table  [ tab : efficiencies ] also shows that under this condition , the maximum efficiency for practical system is @xmath89 for the practical case with at most @xmath90 subcarriers .",
    "when @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 . the objective function ( [ eq : mimoofdmmax ] )",
    "becomes @xmath93 , and the constraint ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) becomes @xmath94 .",
