    "it often happens that mathematical theories have unexpected applications in physics . in the present case of the theory of symmetric polynomials ( sp )",
    "we have , additionally , the remarkable situation , that physicists have re - discovered certain fragments of the theory of sp in order to solve problems in few - particle quantum statistical mechanics @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "actually , it turns out that a part of the physical theory of ideal quantum gases is equivalent to a part of the theory of sp if a certain translation scheme is applied , see below .",
    "the central idea of this scheme , namely that partition functions can be considered as evaluations of certain sp , is not novel , but appeared at various places in the literature , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , often in the context of generalized statistics .",
    "nevertheless , the relevance for the problems treated in the above - mentioned articles and the consequences of this observation seem to have remained largely unnoticed .",
    "+ a second field where sp might be important tools is the theory of quantization in the form suggested by f.  a.  berezin @xcite and subsequently further developed , see e.  g.  @xcite . here",
    "the same sp as in quantum statistical mechanics occur in the expansion of the quantization operator for two - dimensional phase spaces with constant curvature .",
    "one could speculate about the underlying reasons and possible extensions of this connection .",
    "we will only explain the basic idea of the connection between sp and quantum statistical theory of ideal gases .",
    "further details may be found in @xcite and @xcite and in the literature quoted there . + it is well - known that the eigenstates of the @xmath0-particle hamiltonian without interactions can be characterized by  occupation number sequences \" @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the occupation number of the @xmath3-th energy level @xmath4 of the @xmath5-particle hamiltonian .",
    "hence @xmath6 and , for fermions , additionally @xmath7 equivalently , each eigenstate can be characterized by a monomial of degree @xmath0 @xmath8 where the @xmath9 are abstract , commuting variables corresponding to the energy levels and @xmath10 denotes the whole occupation number sequence .",
    "the energy eigenvalues corresponding to these eigenstates are @xmath11 now we can express the @xmath0-particle partition function as @xmath12{ll } b_n(x_1,x_2,\\ldots ) & \\mbox { : bosons}(+ ) \\\\",
    "f_n(x_1,x_2,\\ldots ) & \\mbox { : fermions}(- ) \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the sum over @xmath10 is subject to the constraint ( [ 1.1 ] ) for bosons , and to ( [ 1.1 ] ) , ( [ 1.2 ] ) for fermions .",
    "since these constraints are invariant under permutations of the variables @xmath13 , the resulting sum of the monomials @xmath14 in ( [ 1.6 ] ) will be a symmetric polynomial of the @xmath13 .",
    "we call these sp  fermi polynomials \" @xmath15 or  bose polynomials \" @xmath16 , respectively . in the theory of sp",
    "the @xmath15 are called  elementary sp \" and the @xmath16  complete sp \" . however , in this article we will stick to our more physical nomenclature .",
    "+     with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . a selected number of curves parametrized by the inverse temperature @xmath19 is shown which illustrate the partition functions for special systems obtained by the evaluation of @xmath20 at the values @xmath21 and @xmath22 . ]",
    "the partition function @xmath23 of a particular system is obtained by evaluation of the corresponding sp along the curve @xmath24 , see figure 1 .",
    "hence we have a @xmath25 correspondence between certain sp and certain  partition types \" of ideal gases . here",
    "the  partition type \" of a system is given by the number @xmath0 of particles , the number @xmath26 of abstract energy levels ( or the dimension of the @xmath5-particle hilbert space ) and the type of the statistics , bose or fermi .",
    "the values @xmath4 of the energy levels , including their degeneracy , only determine the system and its particular partition function .",
    "hence a sp corresponds not to a single system but to a large class of systems .",
    "it is then obvious , that mathematical relations between the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 can be translated into physical relations between the corresponding partition functions , irrespective of the values of the @xmath4 .",
    "+ there is a third kind of sp with a physical meaning in the theory of ideal gases , the  power sums \" @xmath27 evaluation at @xmath28 gives @xmath29 one of the central results of the elementary theory of sp is that each of the above families of sp , the @xmath15 , the @xmath16 , and the @xmath30 , can be used as a  basis \" of sp , in the sense that any sp can be expressed as a polynomial of the @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 or @xmath30 ) .",
    "this implies that the fermionic partition functions can be expressed by means of the bosonic ones and vice versa .",
    "moreover , both in turn can be expressed by means of the @xmath5-particle partition function at different inverse temperatures @xmath31 .",
    "these relations are more or less known in the physical literature but their origin in the theory of sp has only recently be disclosed @xcite .",
    "+ sp can be defined through their generating functions . in statistical mechanics",
    "the corresponding generationg functions are called  grand canonical partitions functions \" and will be denoted by @xmath32 for bosons and @xmath33 for fermions .",
    "the formal parameter @xmath34 is physically interpreted as the fugacity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the chemical potential .",
    "the physical domain of @xmath34 is @xmath37 for bosons and @xmath38 for fermions .",
    "+ there exists a fundamental symmetry @xmath39 of the ring @xmath40 of sp , which maps the @xmath15 onto the @xmath16 , see @xcite .",
    "it is connected with the equation @xmath41 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this relation is that the fermionic grand canonical partitions function is related to the analytical continuation of the bosonic one to negative @xmath34 and vice versa .",
    "similar relations for other thermodynamic functions are implied . whether analytical continuation is possible depends on the system under consideration .",
    "for the system of particles in a box it has been shown that analytical continuation of the partition functions is possible in the thermodynamic limit @xcite and the resulting bose - fermi symmetry has been discussed .",
    "another bose - fermi symmetry has been observed for particles in odd space dimensions confined by a common harmonic oscillator potential @xcite . here",
    "@xmath42 implies @xmath43 .",
    "since here analytical continuation is involved w.  r.  t.  the @xmath19-plane , it is not yet clear how this symmetry is related to that given by @xmath44 + these and further relations and translation schemes will be sketched in the table below . for details see @xcite and , as a standard reference for the theory of sp , @xcite .",

    "@xmath70 is given in the form of an infinite product , see @xcite , which resembles the grand canonical partition functions considered in the previous section .",
