    "the nature of two close pairs of qsos , q1634 + 267a , b ( separation 3.77 ) and q2345 + 007a , b ( 7.03 ) is still not established with certainty . in both cases ,",
    "the two components of the pair have the same redshift within the errors of measurement and , as a result , they have both been considered likely to result from gravitational lensing of a single qso ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a candidate for the lens has not been established with certainty in either case , despite the fact that such wide spacings require either an unusually massive galaxy or a cluster of galaxies .",
    "deep infrared observations at the keck 10-meter telescope of q1634 + 267a , b have not revealed a candidate lensing galaxy down to a 3.5 @xmath2 detection limit of k = 21.3 mag , although we note as well that the object responsible for the strong absorption line system at @xmath3 was also not detected ( @xcite , j. larkin , personal communication ) . a @xmath4 lens candidate for q2345 + 007a , b has recently been detected by fischer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) northeast of image b , but it will take at least a 10-meter - class telescope to measure the redshift of the candidate .",
    "bonnet et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have both reported arclets and lensing - induced distortions of faint galaxies near the pair , which is further evidence for the presence of a massive lens . using redshifts of galaxies in the field of q2345 + 007a ,",
    "b estimated with multi - color photometry , pell et al .  ( 1996 ) have found evidence for a cluster of galaxies at @xmath5 , but the cluster core lies 45  away from the lensed pair . accordingly , the possibility is still entertained that the pairs are binary qsos with separations of a few tens of kpc . a resolution of the question is of considerable importance because such qso pairs are essential for measuring the sizes of the intervening absorption systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; dinshaw et al .  1994 , 1995 ) ; however , the limits determined for the sizes depend strongly on whether a particular close pair is a manifestation of lensing or a real binary qso .",
    "steidel & sargent ( 1991a ) recorded high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the qso pairs",
    "q1634 + 267a , b and q2345 + 007a , b in order to examine critically the degree of similarity of the two components in each pair .",
    "the two components were observed _",
    "simultaneously _ with a long slit .",
    "they found that the overall continuum shapes in the spectra of each pair were remarkably similar and that , in general , the emission lines closely matched .",
    "however , they also discovered that the ly @xmath0 , , , and emission lines of the two images of q1634 + 267a , b exhibit differences in profile , which they described as velocity shifts of as much as @xmath6 1000 . on the other hand , while the redshifts of the emission lines in the spectra of q2345 + 007a , b are indistinguishable within the measurement errors , ( @xmath7 ) , the ly @xmath0 and , particularly , the ] emission lines differ significantly in strength in the two spectra . because of the remarkable overall similarity of the spectra of the components within each pair , steidel & sargent ( 1991a ) concluded that both q1634",
    "+ 267a , b and q2345 + 007a , b result from gravitational lensing . since the prominent spectral differences are too large to be comfortably accommodated as microlensing by stars in the lens ( @xcite , @xcite ) , they ascribed the differences to intrinsic emission line profile variations on a characteristic time scale less than the time delays between the light travel times of the two images , which are roughly one year for both pairs .",
    "variability in the strengths and profiles of quasar broad emission lines on year and shorter time scales has been reported by a number of workers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) , but these reports have been based on either observations of the balmer lines or on comparatively noisy spectra of the high - ionization ultraviolet lines obtained with _",
    "international ultraviolet explorer _ satellite .",
    "following steidel & sargent s ( 1991a ) work , corbin ( 1992 ) announced that he had discovered increases in the equivalent widths acccompanied by shifts of 2200  in the redshifts of the ] emission line in the spectra of two qsos .",
    "the spectra had been observed 1.5 years apart .",
    "this work has not been fully published or critically assessed and , even if it proves to be correct , there is no information on the ubiquity of such behavior , although there have been other reports of profile differences in the broad lines of candidate gravitationally - lensed quasars pairs ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , there are two reports of dramatic velocity differences similar to those described by steidel & sargent ( 1991a )",
    ". saunders et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that the quasar pair pc 1643 + 4631a , b ( @xmath8 , separation 198 ) is lensed by a cluster responsible for the cosmic microwave background decrement detected by jones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the direction of the quasar pair .",
    "michalitsianos et al .",
    "( 1997 ) describe a velocity difference of @xmath9  between the broad emission lines of um425a , b , a pair of @xmath10 quasars with a 6.5  separation .",
    "there is a persuasive indirect argument for believing that the centroid velocities of the broad emission lines in qsos must vary .",
    "namely , it is observed that the velocities determined from different ions in a quasar spectrum often differ by @xmath6 1000 .",
    "since the distribution of velocity differences is broad with a mode that is consistent with 0  ( @xcite ) , it is likely that these velocity differences reflect variability in the velocities of the broad lines , although on an unknown time scale .",
    "based on the above considerations , we decided to search for emission line profile and velocity changes in single qsos by reobserving 30 objects from the survey of steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) , using an identical instrument configuration .",
    "the spectra used in the survey were obtained for measuring _ absorption _",
    "lines , in particular , the @xmath112796,2803 doublet ; accordingly , their s / n ratio is exceptionally high . in order to study the cosmological evolution of absorption , the qsos were selected to have redshifts in two ranges , one around @xmath12 and the other around @xmath13 .",
    "in general , the spectra cover the wavelength region from below the ] @xmath14 emission line to above the @xmath15 emission line .",
    "we chose to repeat only spectra of qsos in the lower redshift range because the sky subtraction is much harder for qsos in the higher redshift range .",
    "we also elected to reobserve the brighter qsos in the original survey where possible .",
    "the observing and data reduction procedures are described in ",
    "2 , an analysis of the spectral differences between the two epochs is given in   3 , and we discuss our conclusions in   4 .",
    "we have reobserved 30 quasars with @xmath16 from the survey of steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) .",
    "we used an identical instrumental setup : the double spectrograph attached to the 5.08 m hale telescope , covering the spectral range from 3100 - 7000  with @xmath17  resolution for wavelengths @xmath18   ( the blue side ) and @xmath19  resolution for wavelengths @xmath20",
    "  ( the red side ) . the observations were made with a 1  slit .",
    "a journal of our observations is presented in table [ tables : journal ] .",
    "we were careful to set the position angle of the slit to the parallactic angle appropriate to the midpoint of the observation in order to minimize light losses at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "however , because of seeing fluctuations and the narrow entrance slit , we can say nothing about changes in continuum fluxes .",
    "moreover , the possibility of guiding errors , together with the fact that the position angle of the slit was not adjusted during the typically hour - long exposures , means that apparent changes in the overall continuum slopes between the two epochs can not be trusted .",
    "our data were reduced using standard techniques and routines from iraf .",
    "the spectra were flux - calibrated using instrumental sensitivity functions determined from observations of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the spectra usually matched at the overlap region between the blue and red cameras .",
    "we found that while our reductions of the original data of steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) agreed very well in the red , there was significant disagreement in the blue .",
    "this disagreement is due to the fact that steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) used the airmass at the end of the exposure , which is the airmass recorded in the image headers at palomar , to compute the extinction correction ; whereas , we used the mean airmass appropriate for the whole exposure .",
    "the comparisons between the two epochs are based exclusively on the re - reduced data .",
    "as described above (   2 ) , we do not trust apparent changes in the continua between the two epochs , primarily because of our use of a narrow slit .",
    "since in this study we are only interested in the emission lines , we have chosen to remove the continuum variations by fitting 5 piece cubic splines to the spectra . the composite qso spectrum synthesized by francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) from 718 individual spectra has many emission lines with few gaps where continuum may be present .",
    "accordingly , our fits are not meant to be accurate representations of the true quasar continua .",
    "the fits were arranged to ignore the broad emission lines and the narrow absorption lines by using a rejection threshold of 2 @xmath2 for positive deviations and a threshold of 4 @xmath2 for negative deviations . as can be seen in figure [ figures : quasars ] ,",
    "the continuum - flattened spectra from the two epochs match very well .",
    "however , there is a distinct tendency for the blue sections of the spectra to agree better than the red sections .",
    "this is surprising because both guiding errors and the incomplete correction for atmospheric dispersion would be expected to have a greater effect on the repeatabilty of the blue ends of the spectra .",
    "however , the red camera of the double spectrograph was prone to ice on the dewar window which was hard to recognize during the course of observations until the effects become very severe .",
    "we have compared the spectra of each qso obtained at the two epochs in two ways .",
    "first we compared the blue and red spectra shown in figure [ figures : quasars ] separately , then we compared the complete spectra .",
    "for this latter purpose color renditions of the spectra obtained at the two epochs were superimposed ; these color pictures are not reproduced here , but digital copies can be supplied to interested readers on request to the first author .",

    "although the formal errors from the cross - correlation analysis ( based on the formulae given in tonry & davis [ 1979 ] ) , are often only 10 or 20 , we took the true error to be the rms velocity difference of the quasar pairs when the whole wavelength range from 3000   to 7000   was correlated .",

    "moreover , based on our detailed examination of the spectra , we believe that a simple velocity shift obtained from a cross - correlation analysis gives a poor description of the complex emission line profile changes actually observed .",
    "nevertheless , we note that we have computed the velocity shifts of ly@xmath0 and in steidel & sargent s ( 1991a ) original spectra of q1634 + 267 by cross - correlating the spectra of a and b and have found that the shifts are @xmath6300 - 500 , not @xmath61000  as these authors reported .",
    "many of the qsos in our sample exhibit temporal variations in the profiles of the broad emission lines similar to the observed differences in line profile between the a and b images of q1623 + 267 and q2345 + 007 .",
    "these variations occur on time scales of 1 - 1.5 years in the rest frames of the qsos .",
    "accordingly , the relatively subtle differences in the broad emission line profiles in these close pairs could be due to the roughly one year difference in light travel time between the a and b components .",
    "consequently , our study supports steidel & sargent s ( 1991a ) conclusion that q1634 + 267a , b and q2345 + 007a , b are lensed quasars and not physical binary quasars . in addition , our study highlights the fact that the spectra of the components of a lensed quasar need not be identical and that the differences should be expected to change with time .    in order to establish beyond doubt that q1634 + 267a , b and q2345 + 007a , b are lensed systems , we suggest searching for correlated amplification changes in the system on time scales of a year and making high sensitivity radio observations of the system , similar to the one that djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1987 ) used to prove that q1145 - 071a , b was _ not _ a lensed system .",
    "we note that patnaik , schneider , & narayan ( 1996 ) have found weak radio emission from q1634 + 267a and the limit on the emission from the b component is consistent with the optical brightness ratio .",

    "( 1996 ) of using weak gravitational lensing to identify mass concentrations in the field q2345 + 007a , b also appears to be promising , but the possible massive cluster inferred from their data requires spectroscopic confirmation .",

    "<S> accordingly , the authors suggested that observations of the spectra of single qsos would reveal similar changes in emission line profiles and equivalent widths on a time scale of one year or less . in order to test steidel & sargent s ( 1991a ) hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained in 1992 high quality spectra of 30 quasars with @xmath1 selected from the brighter qsos in the sample of steidel & sargent ( 1991b ) , which those authors had observed in 198990 . </S>",
    "<S> the new spectra were obtained with exactly the same instrumental setup as the earlier observations . </S>",
    "<S> the two sets of spectra were reduced in an identical manner and then compared in order to search for changes in the strengths and profiles of the principal emission lines occurring on time scales of order one year . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectra from the two epochs are remarkably similar for all the qs0s , except for overall changes in fluxes and minor differences in continuum shape which are probably artifacts introduced by the observing procedures . however , there are also changes in the equivalent widths or shapes of the stronger emission lines on rest - frame time scales of 1 - 1.5 years in about two thirds of the qsos . </S>",
    "<S> these observations , therefore , support the notion that q1634 + 267a , b and q2345 + 007a , b are gravitationally lensed and that the spectra of the components in lensed qsos need not be exactly identical . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it should be expected that any differences between the components in such systems should change with time . </S>"
