    "there has been much activity in the field of surface growth in the last period @xcite .",
    "some problems are now rather well understood , nevertheless , many questions still remain open or not completely clarified .",
    "one of them is the effect of defects on growth . in particular",
    ", we have in mind a defect which persists during the growth and makes the growth inhomogeneous .",
    "this problem is relevant for various physical situations .",
    "for example , 1 + 1 dimensional epitaxial growth ( one - dimensional substrate and one dimension in the direction of growth ) of steps on vicinal surfaces when there is a line defect on the terrace in the growth direction . growth becomes inhomogeneous , the growth velocity at the defect can be lower ( the moving step edge is pinned to the defect ) or higher ( the defect causes an excess of incorporated particles ) than averaged velocity of the homogeneous step edge .",
    "an impurity floating on the growth front can have similar effect . in the case of 2 + 1 dimensional growth on a substrate with a defect ( for example a dislocation )",
    "the defect is replicated in the grown material and makes the growth inhomogeneous .",
    "still another situation is growth of a two - component material forming two domains separated by a domain wall ; growth rate at the domain wall is different from growth rate within domains @xcite .",
    "epitaxial growth in these situations was so far little studied theoretically , although it is of great practical importance .",
    "nevertheless , similar problems were investigated in different contexts @xcite .    from the statistical - mechanical point of view",
    "the central problem is the existence and the character of pinning - depinning transition .",
    "the lack of deposition may result in a dip of depth @xmath3 located at the defect .",
    "the growing surface may be pinned , if @xmath3 scales linearly with the sample size @xmath0 , or it may be depinned , if @xmath3 remains finite when the sample size goes to infinity . however , the dip may scale as a power of @xmath0 , @xmath4 . to distinguish between different situations",
    "we shall call the case with @xmath5 _ strong pinning _ , and the case @xmath6 _ weak pinning_. the situation when @xmath7 corresponds either to depinning , if @xmath8 , or to various types of logarithmic pinning , like @xmath9 with positive exponent @xmath10 .",
    "several authors investigated the problem of pinning of growing interfaces through various formulations .",
    "wolf and tang @xcite studied inhomogeneous growth analytically using the growth equation proposed by kardar , parisi and zhang ( kpz ) @xcite .",
    "they found that depending on the sign of the coefficient @xmath11 in front of the non - linear term in the kpz equation there is different behaviour of the surface profile with the size @xmath0 of the sample for the lack and for the excess of deposition at the defect .",
    "for @xmath12 , extra deposition at the defect site leads to a pile of amplitude @xmath3 increasing linearly with @xmath0 , whereas the lack of deposition produce a groove of depth @xmath3 , increasing logarithmically , @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , linear and logarithmic dependence",
    "are interchanged .",
    "kandel and mukamel @xcite performed numerical simulations of 1 + 1 dimensional polynuclear growth model with a defect .",
    "they observed a defect - induced phase transition when changing the strength of the defect , manifested by the change of the dependence of the dip , @xmath3 , on the system size .",
    "they found that @xmath3 scales as @xmath15 , with @xmath5 in the strong - defect phase , while @xmath16 for weak defect phase .",
    "in further investigation , a mean - field description of the phase transition was used @xcite and the mean - field value of the exponent @xmath17 in the weak defect phase was found to be @xmath7 .",
    "tang and lyuksyutov @xcite investigated the problem in mathematically equivalent formulation as localization of a directed polymer in disordered medium .",
    "they found that there is no depinning transition in 1 + 1 dimensions for a line defect and in 2 + 1 dimensions for a plane defect , while depinning occurs for a line defect in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this finding is not in contradiction with the results of @xcite , because in @xcite the short - time regime @xmath18 is observed , where the weak pinning can not be distinguished from strong pinning .",
    "the problem of growth in the single - step model is equivalent to diffusion in the asymmetric exclusion model @xcite , where the defect corresponds to a blockage .",
    "such a situation was already studied analytically and some results on the nature of the impurity - induced phase transition are available .",
    "they deal with the presence of a strongly pinned phase . the matrix technique developed by derrida _",
    "@xcite for studying the asymmetric exclusion model with open boundary conditions was used in the case of mobile impurity in the medium , observing a phase transition when changing the strength of the impurity @xcite .",
    "using bethe ansatz it was also argued in favour of the existence of the phase transition induced by a point defect @xcite .",
    "the pinning - depinning transition corresponds to the phase transition characterized by condensation of particles .",
    "the exact analysis of small systems ( @xmath19 ) accompanied by the use of pad approximants @xcite gives some rigorous bounds on the region of strongly pinned phase .",
    "however , the possibility of the phase transition to the weak pinning regime remained open .    to our knowledge , the case of weak pinning was not explicitly considered in the existing literature and none of available calculations yields reasonable estimate of the exponent @xmath17 in the weakly pinned phase , even though the matrix technique should in principle be able to give exact solution and the generalized bethe ansatz for complicated boundary conditions seems promising @xcite . at present it is not clear under which conditions the weakly pinned phase with @xmath6 exists and what is the value of @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we show the existence of weak pinning and present the calculations of the exponent @xmath17 in 1 + 1 dimensional single - step model of inhomogeneous growth .",
    "we use an approach combining bethe ansatz and renormalization - group argument .",
    "we also present results of numerical simulations confirming the predicted exponent .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the growth model considered , and give the definition of the dip for the surface of an arbitrary orientation . in section 3 the one particle solution is described explicitly .",
    "the latter result is used in section 4 for construction of two - particle states .",
    "section 5 contains our main results , both analytical and numerical , and the last , sixth section is devoted to discussion of the results .",
    "in numerical simulations of surface growth , solid - on - solid ( sos ) models are often employed because the surface can be simply described by a single height function @xmath20 of the substrate coordinate @xmath21 . in most of numerical studies of inhomogeneous growth ,",
    "so - called restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models with the additional constraint on the height difference of the neighbouring sites were used .",
    "the direct consequence of the constraint is that the number of possible configurations is finite .",
    "the rsos models are rather well understood in the case of homogeneous growth @xcite .",
    "the simplest one of these models is the single - step model with the height difference being only @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this class of models is particularly suitable for numerical as well as analytical approaches . in 1 + 1",
    "dimensions an exact solution is known , using the bethe ansatz @xcite .    we consider an inhomogeneous 1 + 1 dimensional single - step growth model . the state of the system is described by an array @xmath24 0,1,2, ... ,@xmath0 of integers , which represent the height of the surface at the site @xmath21 with the constraint @xmath25 which enables representation of the state of the surface using ising spin variables @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 .",
    "we impose cyclic boundary conditions . in terms of the spin variables they read @xmath28 , while for the height variables they fix the difference @xmath29 , _ i. e. _ the global tilt , constant during the growth .",
    "we consider only pure growth ( no evaporation ) .",
    "growth is possible only at a growth site @xmath21 which obeys the condition @xmath30 .",
    "the deposition of a particle results in the change of the configuration : @xmath31 _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath32 .",
    "the inhomogeneity is introduced by the change of the rate for deposition on one fixed site .",
    "we suppose the deposition rate at a growth site @xmath33 to be equal to 1 , and the deposition rate at a growth site on the defect site @xmath34 to be @xmath35 .",
    "the variable @xmath36 denotes the strength of the defect .",
    "the value @xmath37 corresponds to total inhibition of growth at the defect , _",
    "i.e. _ to maximum possible pinning ; due to the single - step constraint the surface profile evolves to a triangular shape in which it remains frozen .",
    "let @xmath38 be the surface height at time @xmath39 . to measure the pinning of the surface with an arbitrary tilt @xmath40",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath41 which we call averaged height difference .",
    "it is the height averaged over ( long ) time interval @xmath42 with the steady increment of the height and the tilt of the surface subtracted .",
    "if there were no defect , the averaged height difference would be zero .",
    "the defect at @xmath43 introduces an inhomogeneity into the system and @xmath44 may depend on position .",
    "we define the dip at the defect site as @xmath45 the surface is pinned , if @xmath46 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath47 .",
    "it seems natural to say that the surface is depinned if @xmath48 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath49 is the order parameter of the pinning transition .",
    "however , @xmath46 may converge to zero in the thermodynamic limit even if @xmath15 with @xmath6 .",
    "the dip blows up , but more slowly than the length of the sample , therefore we call this situation _ weak pinning _ with exponent @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamics of the system has the following conservation law .",
    "the sum of all spin variables , @xmath50 does not change during the growth .",
    "@xmath51 should be understood as the average orientation of the surface , @xmath52 , fixed by the boundary conditions .",
    "the single - step model is mapped to the asymmetric exclusion model if we consider down spins as particles and up spins as unoccupied sites . in the language of asymmetric exclusion model ,",
    "the corresponding conserved quantity is the number of particles @xmath53 . the particle density @xmath54 is @xmath55 for horizontal and @xmath56 for tilted surface .",
    "the situation corresponds to directed diffusion of @xmath57 hard core particles on a line . at each time step",
    ", each particle can remain in the original position or jump to its right next neighbour site , provided it is unoccupied .",
    "the jumping rate from the site @xmath43 to @xmath58 is @xmath35 , while the jumping rate from @xmath21 to @xmath59 for @xmath33 is 1 .",
    "the conservation law facilitates the exact solution of the system .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution @xcite starts with writing the master equation for the probabilities of all possible configurations .",
    "the set of all configurations can be divided into sectors according to number of particles .",
    "for each number of particles @xmath57 , the master equation @xmath60 is solved independently . here , the variables @xmath61 describe positions of the particles and @xmath62 is probability of finding the particles in the specified spatial configuration .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath57-particle transition matrix @xmath63 contains all information on the dynamics of the system .",
    "the solution for arbitrary @xmath57 is still not known .",
    "we shall present exact solution for @xmath64 .",
    "in the case of a single diffusing particle the solution is quite easy . for @xmath65",
    "the master equation has a very simple form @xmath66 we can solve it by finding the ( right ) eigenvectors of the transfer matrix @xmath67 in the one - particle sector .",
    "the eigenvectors are parametrized by a complex number @xmath68 .",
    "as we shall see , also the left eigenvectors are useful , so we determine both of them .",
    "we write @xmath69 for the right eigenvectors and @xmath70 for the left ones .",
    "the left and right eigenvectors for different @xmath71 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "we look for the solution in the form @xmath72 for @xmath73 or @xmath74 , where @xmath75 may be different in the regions @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we find easily @xmath76 and similarly for the left eigenvectors @xmath77 the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath78 .",
    "the stationary solution @xmath79 of the master equation is the eigenvector with zero eigenvalue , _",
    "i.e. _ with @xmath80 , normalized so that @xmath81 .",
    "the stationary solution gives immediately the stationary height profile .",
    "for @xmath82 , the value of @xmath44 is zero for all @xmath21 , whereas for @xmath83 we have @xmath84 hence the dip at the defect is @xmath85    because there is only one particle , it is obvious that the surface is not pinned ; the value of the dip for all @xmath36 and @xmath0 is at most 1 .",
    "so , in order to actually observe the pinning , we should have non - zero density of particles in the thermodynamic limit @xmath86 .",
    "this requires a substantially different approach .",
    "we apply a scheme similar to the real space renormalization group technique .",
    "suppose we have even number @xmath57 of particles in the sample of length @xmath0 , which is also even .",
    "the time evolution is governed by the transfer matrix @xmath87 .",
    "( from now on we shall write explicitly the dependence of the transfer matrix on @xmath36 ) .",
    "the presence of the defect of strength @xmath36 results in a dip @xmath88 . taking each pair of neighbour particles as a single object",
    ", we have system of @xmath89 effective particles .",
    "their interactions are rather complex , but the fact , that the particles are hard - core , _",
    "i.e. _ they can not skip one another , is preserved even for the effective particles .",
    "the time evolution is no more described by a markov process governed by some transfer matrix , but by a more general evolution operator @xmath90 .",
    "however , we suppose that we can approximate the dynamics by a markov process and map the system of @xmath89 effective particles onto the original system , but with half number of particles and different effective strength of the defect @xmath91 : @xmath92    the lattice constant of the new system is twice as large , because pairs of particles occupy two original sites , so the length of the rescaled sample is half of the original one",
    ". also the height is rescaled by a factor 2 .",
    "the procedure roughly corresponds to replacing four atoms deposited independently on the surface by a single `` composite '' atom made of four original atoms glued together .",
    "the dependence of rescaled strength of the defect @xmath91 on the original @xmath36 can be computed by equating the dip in the original and rescaled system @xmath93 this equation may be understood also as the requirement of the equality of deposited mass in the original system and the rescaled system .    a justification for the doubling procedure may be provided _ a posteriori _ by the comparison of the whole surface profiles in the original and rescaled systems .",
    "if the deviation is small even far from the location of the defect , we can suppose that the pairs of particles actually behave like the original particles , but in rescaled system .",
    "the simplest way for obtaining an approximation for the function @xmath94 is to compute the average height profile for @xmath95 and the corresponding dip . from ( [ dip_1 ] ) and ( [ compare_dips ] ) it follows that @xmath96    fortunately",
    ", the @xmath95 case is soluble exactly . if @xmath82 , the solution is given simply by bethe ansatz .",
    "the many - particle eigenvector is the linear combination of products of one - particle eigenvectors .",
    "however , doing the same for @xmath97 does not work , because the system lacks translational symmetry .",
    "but the bethe ansatz eigenfunctions @xmath98 may serve as a good starting point for further calculations , because they must obey the equation @xmath99 in all cases when both particles are far from the defect . moreover , if we construct the eigenfunction from the exact one - particle eigenvectors ( [ eq : pi ] ) , which are calculated for given @xmath100 , then the equation ( [ secular_2 ] ) will hold even if one of the particles is at the defect . only such terms when both particles are at ( or near ) the defect will disagree .",
    "but we may treat the difference as a localized perturbation and solve exactly the equation for the resolvent @xmath101 .",
    "so , let us start by explicitly writing the eigenvalue equation ( [ secular_2 ] ) . we define the hopping rate from the site @xmath21 @xmath102 then , the two - particle eigenvalue equation is @xmath103 from the cyclic boundary conditions it follows that @xmath104 .",
    "we construct the bethe eigenfunctions @xmath105 using the one - particle functions ( [ eq : pi ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath106 is set so that ( [ secular_2off ] ) are satisfied far from the defect @xcite .",
    "for @xmath107 we take @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath11 is @xmath109 the values of @xmath68 and @xmath110 are set by the cyclic boundary conditions , resulting in a pair of algebraic equations @xmath111 which can be solved numerically by standard methods . together with the solution @xmath107 we have @xmath112 pairs @xmath113 .",
    "each of them determines one of right eigenvectors of some matrix @xmath114 , which differs from @xmath115 only in several matrix elements , so we can take @xmath114 as a first approximation to @xmath115 and treat the difference @xmath116 as a perturbation .",
    "let @xmath117 be matrix whose columns are the bethe eigenfunctions @xmath118 ( pairs @xmath119 denote rows , pairs @xmath113 denote columns ) .",
    "we can write @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the diagonal matrix with numbers @xmath122 on the diagonal .",
    "it is quite easy to find the inverse @xmath123 if @xmath82 .",
    "as bethe functions @xmath98 are exact right eigenvectors of @xmath115 , the bethe functions @xmath124 constructed by the same procedure from the left one - particle eigenvectors @xmath125 are exact left eigenvectors of @xmath115 . because left and right eigenvectors with different eigenvalues are orthogonal",
    ", the matrix composed of properly normalized left eigenvectors is the inverse of @xmath117 . when @xmath97 , the situation is different , but in fact we need to make only a tiny modification .",
    "it can be checked directly ( actually we performed the check using maple v ) that the vectors @xmath126 are orthogonal to the vectors @xmath98 and so , after proper normalization , they represent rows of the matrix @xmath123 .",
    "as we already said , vectors @xmath98 are considered as nearly exact eigenvectors of @xmath115 .",
    "what we exactly mean is that @xmath127 where the matrix @xmath128 has only two non - zero rows , corresponding to row indices @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "( the column indices are the pairs @xmath113 ) .",
    "we have explicitly @xmath131    the solution is obtained , as soon as we compute the resolvent @xmath132 @xmath133 .",
    "if we define the `` unperturbed '' resolvent @xmath134 @xmath135 , using elementary matrix algebra we obtain equation @xmath136 which we call dyson equation , taking an analogy from the quantum mechanics .",
    "let @xmath137 be projector to the two - dimensional subspace corresponding to indices @xmath138 and @xmath139 and @xmath140 the complementary projector to it .",
    "the dyson equation can be solved within that subspace , because @xmath141 .",
    "we obtain @xmath142 computation of the matrix inverses is very simple , because they involve only matrices @xmath143 .",
    "the stationary state is obtained from the resolvent in the @xmath144 limit @xmath145 the column index of the resolvent may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "it corresponds to the fact that stationary state does not depend on initial conditions .",
    "we calculated explicitly the two - particle ( @xmath95 ) stationary state @xmath146 , defined on the triangle @xmath147 for @xmath0 ranging from 4 to 32 .",
    "the figures [ fig:1 ]    and [ fig:2 ]    show the stationary state for @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in both cases ,",
    "the defect is located at @xmath150 .",
    "we can see that for small @xmath36 the effect of the defect is weaker , but more delocalized in the two - dimensional configuration space @xmath119 .",
    "the probability is distributed nearly homogeneously , but there is a band of higher probability composed of points which have any of the coordinates @xmath151 equal to @xmath43 .",
    "large @xmath36 leads to localization of the eigenfunction around the point @xmath152 ; in the latter case a single peak develops which bears nearly all the probability .",
    "these results were further used to calculate the stationary height profile difference @xmath44 and dependence @xmath94 of the renormalized strength of the defect on the bare value of @xmath36 .",
    "the figure [ fig:3 ]    shows the profiles for @xmath153 and different @xmath36 s .",
    "this situation corresponds to horizontal surface ( @xmath154 ) . in the same fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we can also compare the exact @xmath95 ( two - particle ) profiles with the effective one - particle ones , calculated for @xmath65 , @xmath155 and defect strength @xmath94 .",
    "we can see that the agreement is rather good in the whole range of @xmath36 , which justifies our doubling procedure .",
    "the figure [ fig:4 ]    shows the same for @xmath148 .",
    "these height profiles are tilted ( @xmath156 ) which leads to the asymmetry of the dip . even in this case",
    "we can see good agreement between the exact two - particle profile and the effective one - particle one .",
    "however , for small @xmath36 and near the defect , the agreement is worse than for horizontal surface .",
    "the key result of our computation is the function @xmath94 . in the figure [ fig:5 ]",
    ",    the dependence of @xmath157 on @xmath36 is shown for both horizontal ( @xmath158 ) and tilted ( @xmath159 ) surfaces .",
    "the physics of pinning is contained in fixed points of the map @xmath160 .",
    "there are surely at least two fixed points , namely 0 and 1 , corresponding to weak pinning ( or depinning ) and strong pinning regime , respectively .",
    "their properties may be determined from the quantities @xmath161 the inequality @xmath162 means that the fixed point @xmath163 is stable ( unstable ) .",
    "let us comment on the weak pinning regime first .",
    "the value of @xmath164 determines the scaling of the dip in the weak pinning regime for @xmath165 .",
    "the exponent is @xmath166 as can be seen from equations ( [ dip_1 ] ) and ( [ compare_dips ] ) .",
    "the values we observe in the fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] are @xmath167 in all cases , corresponding to weak pinning , @xmath168 , while @xmath169 would be signal of depinning ( or logarithmic pinning ) , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the weak pinning regime is always present .",
    "the most important result is the value of the exponent for horizontal profile .",
    "we have observed an interesting result , that for @xmath154 it is @xmath170 up to the precision of our numerical procedure ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "so , we conjecture , that the exact value of the exponent for horizontal surface and @xmath165 is @xmath172 this value may be compared directly with numerical simulations .",
    "the dependence of @xmath164 and the corresponding exponent @xmath17 on the particle density @xmath173 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "we can see that the exponent @xmath17 decreases smoothly when decreasing the density and seems to approach 0 for @xmath174 .",
    "it reflects the fact , that for zero density there is only finite number of particles on infinite sample and the dip should be also finite .",
    "the point at @xmath154 does not fit to this smooth dependence .",
    "the explanation lies most probably in the different symmetry group of the horizontal surface .",
    "( for tilted surfaces , the particle - hole symmetry is broken . )",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the phase transition from weak - pinning to strong - pinning regime .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we can see , that @xmath82 is stable fixed point because @xmath175 for all @xmath176 . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the fixed point @xmath37 is unstable for @xmath154 ( @xmath177 ) , but stable for @xmath156 ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the existence of a phase transition for some @xmath179 would be signalled by the presence of a third ( unstable ) fixed point .",
    "we may formulate it by saying that @xmath180 has a root at @xmath181 with positive derivative , @xmath182 , @xmath183 . the critical value @xmath184 separates the weak - pinning ( low @xmath36 ) and strong pinning ( high @xmath36 ) regimes , corresponding to different scaling of the dip . for @xmath185 we have @xmath186 , for @xmath187 we have @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath154 we did not find the third fixed point .",
    "instead , the unstable fixed point at @xmath37 plays its role and we conclude that there is no phase transition for @xmath188 and we are in the weak pinning regime for all @xmath188 .    for @xmath156",
    "we find @xmath189 , but very close to 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath184 are 0.9371 , 0.9605 , 0.97535 for @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "the dependence of @xmath191 on @xmath192 near the critical point is shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .    finally , we compare some of our results with numerical simulations .",
    "we performed direct monte carlo simulations of growth in the inhomogeneous single - step model for horizontal surface , _ i.e. _ , density @xmath158 in asymmetric exclusion model .",
    "we measured the dip ( [ eq : dip ] ) as the function of the system size @xmath0 and time @xmath39 for several strengths of the defect @xmath36 .",
    "when we start from the flat configuration , the dip increases with time and after some time @xmath193 ( growing with the system size ) the stationary regime is reached . in this regime",
    "the dip fluctuates around the characteristic value @xmath194 .",
    "we concentrate on the weak defect regime , i.e. , small @xmath36 . in this case fluctuations",
    "are very strong and many independent runs are needed to obtain the value of the saturated dip .",
    "results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ]    are averages over @xmath195 to @xmath196 independent runs .",
    "we observed that the slope , _ i.e. _ exponent @xmath17 is slightly decreasing with decreasing @xmath36 , but it is definitely larger than @xmath55 .",
    "we calculated exponent @xmath17 by fitting the last five points in each curve .",
    "values obtained for @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 are @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively .",
    "the value obtained for the lowest value @xmath197 agrees well with the analytical prediction ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , so we conclude that the @xmath165 limit is well described by our analytical calculations .",
    "we solved exactly in a special case the problem of growing interface in presence of a point defect . in the language of asymmetric exclusion model",
    ", we obtained the solution for cyclic boundary conditions in the two - particle sector .",
    "the solution consists in two steps . at first , using the bethe - ansatz eigenfunctions as a basis set , we found that the perturbation becomes localized in the configuration space .",
    "then we solved the dyson equation exactly by inversion of small matrices .",
    "we computed the stationary profile of the surface and determined the dip at the defect .",
    "the two - particle result was then employed in a renormalization - group consideration , based on a lattice constant doubling transformation .",
    "we obtained the dependence of the effective defect strength @xmath91 on the original , bare defect strength @xmath36 .",
    "fixed points of this mapping were identified .",
    "our main result is the existence of the weak pinning phase and the value of the corresponding exponent .",
    "let us discuss first the situation for a horizontal surface ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "we have found just two fixed points : @xmath82 which is stable , and corresponds to weak pinning of the surface to the defect , @xmath4 with @xmath6 , and @xmath204 which is unstable .",

    "we verified the existence of weak pinning by a direct monte carlo simulation of the inhomogeneous single - step growth model . for weak defect ,",
    "@xmath36 close to 0 , we obtained @xmath206 in good agreement with the analytical prediction .    the ref .",
    "@xcite reports linear dependence of the dip on @xmath0 , suggesting that @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite state that @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the slope of the interface at the defect .",
    "they use the parameter @xmath208 as a measure of the strength of the defect .",
    "we understand this choice as being dictated by the use of a continuous model ( kpz equation ) .",
    "however , we use different parametrization , namely taking the strength of the defect @xmath36 as a control parameter . for @xmath36 fixed , the value of @xmath208 may depend on @xmath0 . a direct comparison of ref .",
    "@xcite with our results would require measurement of the quantity @xmath208 , which was not performed in our simulations .    in the case of tilted surfaces",

    "the absence of phase transition at @xmath188 for @xmath154 is in contradiction with numerical simulations on the inhomogeneous polynuclear growth model @xcite as well as with analytical results @xcite .",
    "the most probable reason lies perhaps in the approximation used in calculation of the map @xmath94 : instead of working with macroscopic sample with generic length @xmath0 and particle number @xmath57 and compare it by the doubling procedure to the sample with length @xmath210 with @xmath89 particles , very small sample , @xmath153 was used . with such small sample",
    ", the influence of boundary conditions may be very strong , deforming the renormalization map @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement of the analytical results with simulations in the weak pinning phase shows that for weak defects the method we used works well .    in order to improve the result ,",
    "it would be necessary to solve the dynamics for a larger number of particles . however , the use of the bethe - ansatz eigenfunctions for number of particles larger than two does not lead to localization of the perturbation and dyson equation can not be solved exactly by explicit matrix inversion .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate the existence of weak pinning in different inhomogeneous models , in particular one would like to know if the value of the exponent @xmath17 for the strength of the defect going to zero is universal , and eventually if a weak - pinning to depinning transition exists ."
