    "the self - trapping and self - focusing of optical beams in nonlinear media of both linear isotropy ( isotropic diffraction ) and nonlinear isotropy have been studied extensively for over three decades  @xcite . in an isotropic medium , the circular symmetry",
    "is conserved , and therefore the fundamental solitons have circularly - symmetrical shape . introducing the nonlinear anisotropy into the medium ,",
    "the self - trapping beams with ellipse - shaped spots can be obtained .",
    "coherent elliptic strongly nonlocal solitons were observed experimentally in lead glass  @xcite , where the nonlinear anisotropy is achieved by rectangular boundaries in the transverse .",
    "elliptical discrete solitons can form in an optically induced two - dimensional photonic lattice , where the nonlinear anisotropy comes of enhanced photorefractive anisotropy and nonlocality under a nonconventional bias condition  @xcite .",
    "it was reported recently that the anisotropic nonlocal nonlinearity of the diffusive ( thermal ) type can stabilize the dipole - mode solitons , which are completely unstable in the isotropic medium  @xcite .",
    "the linear anisotropy is also important in many soliton phenomena . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the self - focusing of the beam propagating in any direction in uniaxial crystals was discussed , there exists an elliptic self - trapping beam for the extraordinary light in uniaxial crystals .",
    "stationary elliptic quadratic solitons  @xcite and elliptic nonlocal solitons  @xcite were found successively in biaxial crystals and the nematic liquid crystals with large birefringence , respectively .",
    "the generation of multiple solitons  @xcite were reported theoretically and experimentally to be the consequence of the linear anisotropy .",
    "the linear isotropy can also make the elliptic optical beams without the initial orbital angular momentum ( oam ) rotate during the linear propagation  @xcite , and the rotation angle will monotonously approach to the value determined by the media and the input parameters of the beam .",
    "it was predicted very recently that the spiraling elliptic solitons with the oam can exist in isotropic saturable nonlinear media  @xcite and in isotropic nonlocal nonlinear media  @xcite , where the oam can bring in the effective linear anisotropy .",
    "the nonlinear propagation of elliptic optical beams in saturable nonlinear medium with the linear anisotropy is investigated in the paper . a class of spiraling elliptic breathers is found to exist in such media , which can rotate even though they have no initial oam .",
    "the angular velocity is no longer a constant but a periodic function of the propagation distance .",
    "the libration of the spiraling elliptic breathers like the pendulum is discovered when the linear anisotropy of the media is large enough .",
    "the propagation of optical beams in saturable nonlinear media with linear anisotropy can be modeled by the following nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse )  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a paraxial beam , @xmath2 is the beam intensity , @xmath3 is the saturation intensity , @xmath4 is the nonlinear index coefficient , @xmath5 is the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the transverse coordinates , @xmath8 is the wavenumber in the media without nonlinearity , @xmath9 is the linear refractive index of the media , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the diffraction coefficients along @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions , respectively . the lager the coefficients are , the more strongly the optical beam diffracts in those directions . when @xmath12 , an optical beam of the circular shape will diffract equally along any direction  @xcite .",

    "it is the case of ref.@xcite , where an elliptic self - trapping beam for the extraordinary light is found to exist in the uniaxial crystal and the semi - axes of the elliptic optical beam lies on the principal plane of the uniaxial crystal .",

    "mathematically , positive @xmath83 at any @xmath69 only requires that the minimum of @xmath83 is positive , i.e. , @xmath84 .",

    "we find that @xmath83 is always positive when @xmath86 , that is , the spiraling elliptic breather will rotate anticlockwise when the linear anisotropy of the media is small enough . as a matter of fact , we have used the positive @xmath92 here , which makes @xmath83 always positive .",
    "of course , we can also use a negative @xmath92 , then the spiraling elliptic breather will rotate clockwise when @xmath86 . from equation  ( [ angular velocity ] ) , it can be found that the sign of @xmath92 depends on sign of @xmath93 .",
    "but the signs of @xmath93 have no effects on equations  ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "taking parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 as an example , we can find the parameter @xmath90",

    "if we set @xmath98 , the spiraling breathers will have no initial oam .",
    "meanwhile , by setting @xmath99 or @xmath100 , the spiraling breathers without the initial oam will rotate anticlockwise or clockwise .",
    "then we obtain that the spiraling breathers without the initial oam rotate anticlockwise when @xmath101 , as is shown in figure  [ nooam ] , and rotate clockwise when @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "such rotation of the spiraling elliptic breathers without the initial oam in the media with the linear anisotropy is different from the rotation resulting from the initial oam in the isotropy media  @xcite .     except for @xmath104 so that @xmath105.,width=302 ]    from the expression of the spiraling elliptic breathers , equation  ( [ solution ] )",
    ", we can obtain the period of the evolution as @xmath106 .",
    "then the period of the spiraling elliptic breather in figure  [ nooam ] is about @xmath107 , where @xmath54 , but we find that the shape of the the spiraling elliptic breather after a period is not the same as the input one at @xmath60 .",
    "it is mainly because that the exact solutions of nlse ( [ nse1 ] ) are not the gaussian function , the variational approach will bring in deviations if we take the gaussian trial solution like equation  ( [ trial ] ) .",
    "the deviations will be expected to disappear if we use the numerical iterative solution of nlse ( [ nse1 ] ) as the input beam at @xmath60 .",
    "nonetheless , we can correctly predict the behaviors of the rotation and libration of the spiraling elliptic breathers by using the variational approach .",
    "if we increase the linear anisotropy of the media so that @xmath108 or @xmath109 , the angular velocity @xmath80 will change its sign during the propagation of the spiraling elliptic breathers , that is , the direction of the rotation of the spiraling elliptic breathers will change , and the libration will appear , librating back and forth like the pendulum , which is shown in figures  [ jiao1 ] ( b ) and [ evolution ] .",
    "the spiraling breather rotates clockwise from @xmath60 to @xmath110 , then changes the rotational direction and rotate anticlockwise until @xmath111 . the critical angle , at which the rotation direction changes , can be found as @xmath112 when @xmath113 , the critical angle can be obtained to be @xmath114 , which agrees well with that of the numerical simulation , as is shown in figure  [ evolution ] ( d ) .",
    "( b).,width=264 ]    it can be proved that the oam is not conserved by the nlse with unequal diffraction coefficients , so the libration of the spiraling elliptic breathers is universal in the nonlinear media with the linear anisotropy if the anisotropy is large enough .",
    "for example , apart form the saturable nonlinear media , we can simply explore the libration of the spiraling elliptic breathers in nonlocal nonlinear media with the linear anisotropy .",
    "we simulate the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath115 taking the optical beam ( [ solution ] ) as an input beam with the response function of the media @xmath116 $ ] , where the parameters , @xmath117 , are the same as those in the figure1 ( a ) of ref.@xcite . but instead of @xmath118 in @xcite , here we use the diffraction coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 to make sure that the parameter of the linear anisotropy , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are the same as those in figure  [ evolution ] of this paper . the evolution of the spiraling elliptic breather is shown in figure  [ nonlocal ] , where the libration happens too .",
    "the spiraling breather rotates anticlockwise from @xmath60 to @xmath123 , then changes the rotational direction and rotate clockwise until @xmath124 , then changes the rotational direction again , and rotate anticlockwise until @xmath125 , then changes the rotational direction again , and rotate clockwise until @xmath126 . the shape of the spiraling elliptic breather at @xmath126 after one period is almost the same as that of the input beam at @xmath60 .",
    "the larger the degree of nonlocality is , the less the difference of the shapes between the beam after one period and the input beam is .",
    "the details about the rotation and libration of the spiraling elliptic breathers in nonlocal nonlinear media with the linear anisotropy will not be reported herein .",
    "and @xmath76 directions of equation  ( 2 ) of @xcite are @xmath127 and @xmath128.,width=302 ]",
    "we have introduced a class of spiraling elliptic breathers in saturable nonlinear media with linear anisotropy .",
    "the breathers have the elliptic light spots , and have two different kinds of evolution modes , that is , the rotation mode and the pendulum - like mode .",
    "the spiraling elliptic breathers can rotate even though they have no initial orbital angular momentum . due to the anisotropy of the media ,",
