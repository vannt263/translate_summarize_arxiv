    "novel phases that correlate quark color and flavor are predicted to occur at asymptotic densities due to the attractive nature of quark - quark interactions in certain color - flavor locked combinations  @xcite .",
    "thus finite temperature and/or density are expected to reflect on various aspects of confinement .",
    "furthermore any modification of the ground state influences symmetry properties and in particular restoration of chiral symmetry is expected . at finite density and low temperature",
    "the precise relation between chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement is not yet known .",
    "a common wisdom is that in this regime there is a phase transition from hadronic ( confined ) matter at low density to the unconfined ( possibly superconducting ) phase at higher densities  @xcite .",
    "recently , however it has been observed that the confined and deconfined phases may be separated by a phase where quarks are confined but chiral symmetry is restored . in the limit of an infinite number of colors @xmath0",
    "this so called quarkyonic phase would in fact extend to infinite density , since in this limit debye screening due to quark loop vanishes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the possible emergence of this new phase using a canonical formulation of the qcd many body problem in the coulomb gauge .",
    "the coulomb gauge canonical formulation can describe both finite temperature and density . in this formulation manifestation of deconfinement can be inferred from the temperature and/or density dependence of the color coulomb interaction .",
    "in contrast lattice simulations at finite density are still at their infancy  @xcite .",
    "one of the smoking gun signals of deconfinement is the possible dissociation of heavy quarkonia  @xcite . by studying density dependence of the coulomb gauge heavy quark potential",
    "we will be able to explore charmonium properties at finite density .",
    "the paper is organized at follows . in the following section we discuss the coulomb gauge qcd and approximations relevant to the problem in hand .",

    "a confinement scenario in the coulomb gauge states that it is the field configurations near the boundary of the gribov region @xmath24 that dominate the qcd vacuum  @xcite and it follows that fluctuations near the boundary lead to massive quasiparticle excitations . since the exact parametrization of the gribov horizon is not known the quantitative description of this confinement scenario varies depending on how restriction to the gribov horizon is implemented , but the general features seem to be robust  @xcite . with this picture in mind",
    "we approximate the ground state of a finite density quark plasma by the state with no quasiparticle gluon excitations and the large background fields concentrated near @xmath24 lead to enhancement in the long range behavior of the coulomb kernel  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , under this shift , the energy @xmath61 of a single quark state ( @xmath62 ) that is given by , @xmath63 \\label{omega}\\ ] ] transforms to @xmath64 so single quark states are clearly unphysical .",

    "as pointed out in @xcite this is necessary in order for color - singlet @xmath35 excitations to have finite , non - negative energies .",
    "this is because the potential energy in the @xmath35 bound state , given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the relative momentum between the quark and the antiquark is large and positive for small @xmath52 ( and approached @xmath70 in the limit @xmath65 ) .",
    "thus the infinities in the @xmath65 limit cancel between the self - energies and the residual interaction between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "since @xmath71 is a lower energy state compared to @xmath72 , after cancelation of the ir divergencies , the finite energy of color single excitations is @xmath73-independent and non - negative .",
    "this is , however not the case for color - nonsinglet states .",
