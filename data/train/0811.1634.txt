    "several examples ( @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) have been studied so far which admit both black hole and naked singularity solutions depending on the choice of the initial data .",
    "most of the work on gravitational collapse has been done by considering dust fluid due to the existence of an exact solution . however , the assumption of dust fluid might be too restricted as the effects of pressure can not always be neglected in the formation processes of the spacetime singularities .",

    "this condition guarantees that the mass function @xmath56 is non - negative near @xmath68 . for case ( iii ) , the mass function @xmath56 is negative near @xmath68 . thus in this case",
    ", the spacetime singularity of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is necessarily naked but it is non - trivial whether the central singularity at @xmath65 is null .",

    "this is a somewhat unexpected result , since , at first glance , one might infer that the pressure effect would be negligible in the situation with the strong gravity near the spacetime singularity .",

    "the high - speed approximation in this domain breaks down when the matter particles approach the symmetry center @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath141 vanishes at @xmath68 , the behavior of the density perturbation @xmath142 in the neighborhood of the central singularity might be different from the above case .",
    "the behavior of @xmath140 near the central singularity has already been shown in sec.iii .",
    "our special interests are in the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , since the the background central singularity has the extent in the future directed ingoing null direction , while in the case ( iii ) and in the covered case , the central singularity is instantaneous ( see figs.1 - 3 ) .",

    "thus the central singularity will be very similar to the central naked singularity of the vaidya solution .    here",
    "it should be noted that this case includes a case of dust @xmath145 .",
    "the dust is described by the lematre - tolman - bondi solution and it is well known the central singularity can also be naked@xcite .",
    "the present result implies that the central singularity formed by the gravitational collapse of a hollow dust sphere is very similar to that formed by the null dust , whereas the non - central singularity is not so .",
    "the latter is in contrast to the cylindrically symmetric case in which the cylindrical hollow dust collapsing with very high speed is well described by the null dust solution even at the spacetime singularity@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case * b * , the perturbation variables @xmath94 and @xmath97 vanish in the limit of @xmath129 with @xmath14 fixed . in the case of @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath142 also vanishes in the same limit , whereas it is finite in the case of @xmath146 .",
    "thus the spacetime structure in the neighborhood of the singularity at @xmath64 is very similar to the vaidya solution .",
    "even if the radial pressure is positive , the high - speed approximation is consistent until the spacetime singularity forms .",
    "the consistency of the high - speed approximation depends not on the radial pressure but on the tangential one . here",
    "note that all of the energy conditions eq.([eq : energy ] ) hold only if @xmath147 holds .",
    "recent observations imply the acceleration of cosmic volume expansion@xcite , and this means the existence of unknown matter components with violation of the strong energy condition",
    ". thus it might be important to consider cases with the violation of the energy conditions as special examples of case * c*. a case of @xmath2 smaller than @xmath148 corresponds to the so - called dark energy , and thus the result obtained here implies that the spacetime singularity formed by spherically symmetric high - speed collapse of the dark energy is similar to that of the vaidya solution .",
    "further , it is worthy to note that in the phantom energy case @xmath149 which is the special case of the dark energy@xcite , @xmath150 is negative and thus the mass function @xmath141 is also negative by eq.([e:31 ] ) .",
    "hence the first order solution of @xmath149 implies that the high - speed collapse of the phantom energy forms the timelike singularity similar to that in the schwarzschild spacetime with a negative mass ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "gravitational collapse is one of the most important topics in gravitational physics .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture provides major motivation to study this issue . since there is no theorem proving or disproving this conjecture or no theorem stating the generic feature of physical spacetime singularities , it is interesting to investigate this issue in the situation different from previously studied ones .",

    "( the causality requirement implies @xmath152 .",
    "the reason why @xmath153 is excluded is that the high - speed approximation is not applicable to the cases of @xmath124 . )",
    "one might think that the collapsing speed becomes very large due to the strong gravity just before the formation of the spacetime singularity .",
    "however , we have found that , in the case of positive tangential pressure @xmath154 , the large initial imploding velocity is necessarily decelerated by the pressure effect and thus the high - speed approximation scheme becomes invalid before the singularity formation .    in the case of the negative or vanishing tangential pressure @xmath155 ,",
    "the behaviors of the perturbation variables are different from the case of @xmath5 . in the case of @xmath156 ,",
    "all of the perturbation are finite at the central singularity , if the background central singularity is null and naked , although the density perturbation blows up at the non - central singularity of the background vaidya spacetime .",
    "this result implies that the central singularity will be null and naked like as that of the vaidya spacetime , for the case of @xmath156 . in the cases of @xmath137 , all of the perturbation variables are finite everywhere",
    "this result implies that , in this case , the geometrical structure near not only the central singularity but also the non - central singularity is very similar to that of the vaidya solution .",
    "here it is worthy to note that as long as @xmath157 , this case satisfies all of the physically reasonable energy conditions , i.e. , the weak , strong and dominant energy conditions .",
    "the result obtained here strongly suggests that the spacetime structure realized by the spherical matter with large enough tangential tension is well described by the vaidya solution even if the physically reasonable energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "it is a remarkable result that the consistency of the high - speed approximation depends not on the radial pressure @xmath23 but on the tangential one @xmath24 . in the case of @xmath158 ,",
    "the gradient of radial pressure will not stop the high - speed collapse .",
    "thus it is reasonable that the consistency of the high - speed approximation depends on the only tangential pressure .",
    "it is non - trivial that even if @xmath159 , the consistency of the high - speed approximation also depends on the only tangential pressure . at first glance",
    ", the gradient of the radial pressure with @xmath159 seems to affect the gravitational collapse , but this is not true .",
    "the reason is that if the sound speed in the radial direction is less than the speed of light ( @xmath160 ) , the spacetime singularity formation by the nearly light - speed collapse can be completed before the effect of radial pressure gradient spreads out , since the sound cone is significantly narrowed down in the frame in which the matter moves with nearly the speed of light .",
    "this is also the reason why the high - speed approximation is not applicable to the case of @xmath153 . in this case , the sound speed in the radial direction is equal to the speed of light and thus the sound cone in the radial direction is equivalent to the light cone which is lorentz invariant . as a result , the effect of the radial pressure gradient can spread out before the singularity formation by the nearly light - speed collapse is completed .",
    "the perturbative construction of approximate solutions on the background null dust solution is impossible in the case of @xmath153 .    the dark energy case",
    ", @xmath161 and @xmath6 , might be important in connection to the issue of the accelerated cosmic expansion@xcite , although the strong energy is not satisfied in this case .",
    "these are included in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "the repulsive gravity due to the dark energy can not decelerate the high - speed collapse , and the formed central singularity can be null , and the non - central part of the spacetime singularity will be spacelike . as mentioned in the above , the pressure gradient force of the dark energy will also not stop the collapse but rather accelerate it .",
    "this property of the dark energy will be the reason why the high - speed collapse becomes a good approximation at the singularity formation in the present case and also why black holes may grow self - similarly due to the accretion of dark energy in the accelerated universe  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the present results are valid up to the only first order and could be modified by the higher order effects .",
    "thus we need to investigate the higher order , but this is a future work .",

    "<S> by contrast , in cases with the negative tangential pressure , the present result implies that the central naked singularity similar to that of the vaidya spacetime can be formed , even though the radial pressure is positive , and the weak , strong and dominant energy conditions hold . </S>",
    "<S> especially , in the case of @xmath6 , the high - speed collapse will produce the spacetime structure very similar to that of the vaidya spacetime </S>",
