    "among many benefits from the inflationary expansion that takes place in the early universe , an important prediction of inflation would be the generation of a spectrum of the primordial perturbations .",
    "such perturbations naturally arise from the zero point vacuum fluctuations in quantum fields , which are stretched during inflation to cover very large scales in our present universe . in the standard scenario of the inflationary universe ,",
    "the observed density perturbation is produced by a light inflaton field that rolls slowly down its potential . at the end of inflation , the inflaton field oscillates about the minimum of its potential and",
    "decays to reheat the universe .",
    "adiabatic density perturbation is generated because the scale - invariant fluctuations of the light inflaton field are different in different patches .",
    "generically , slow - roll models of inflation predict an almost scale - invariant and gaussian distribution of primordial density perturbations .",
    "we are not going back to historical developments , however it is easy to understand that the idea of hybrid inflation may provide us with a key idea to construct successful inflationary models@xcite . in hybrid models ,",
    "the end of inflationary expansion is a second - order phase transition triggered by a trapped field ( waterfall field ) .",
    "d - term inflation is an important application of this idea , which is found in the paradigm of supersymmetric particle cosmology . furthermore",
    ", an important variant of d - term inflation is found in the paradigm of brane cosmology , which is called brane inflation@xcite . from phenomenological viewpoints ,",
    "brane models are sometimes categorized as models with large or intermediate extra dimensions ( and vice versa)@xcite .",
    "the idea of large extra dimensions is important for higher - dimensional models , because it may solve or weaken the hierarchy problem . in models with large extra dimensions , fields in the standard model(sm ) are localized on a wall - like structure ( maybe it is a brane ) , while the graviton propagates in the bulk .",
    "the discrepancy of the volume factor between gauge fields and gravitational fields explains the large hierarchy between gravity and gauge interactions .    of course",
    ", it is an important challenge to find signatures of branes in cosmological observations .",
    "historically , it has been discussed that studying the formation and the evolution of cosmological defects would provide us with important information about branes@xcite .",
    "inflation models with low fundamental scale are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "scenarios of baryogenesis in such low - scale models are discussed in ref.@xcite , where defects play distinguishable roles .",
    "the curvatons@xcite will play significant roles in these low - scale models@xcite .",
    "moreover , in ref.@xcite , it has been discussed that topological defects can play the role of the curvatons .",
    "thus , defects in brane models such as monopoles , strings , domain walls and q - balls are important@xcite",
    ". it might be important to explain why defects other than strings can be produced in brane inflationary models , since ( historically ) it has been discussed by many authors that only strings are produced in brane inflationary models@xcite .",
    "it is not hard to understand that this conjecture is not so generic as it has been anticipated , as one can see from ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to find signatures of branes , it is important to consider other types of defects as well as cosmic strings .",
    "our scenario of elliptic inflation is important , in a sense that it may provide us with another clue as to how one can find signature of branes from cosmological observations , as we will discuss in sect.3.5 .",
    "when it appeared , d - term inflation was believed to circumvent the well - known eta - problem of supergravity models of inflation based on f - terms .",
    "thus brane inflation , which is in a sense a variant of d - term inflation , was believed to circumvent the eta - problem .",
    "however , a similar problem arose later again in brane paradigm .",
    "the problem was that the very mechanism that lifts the moduli potential was found to lift inflaton candidates and violate slow - roll conditions@xcite .",
    "directions that are protected by exact global symmetry may be expected to remain flat , however it is still very difficult to find actual symmetry that can survive after moduli stabilization and can be used to construct a successful inflationary scenario . from the perspective we discussed above , we believe that finding new mechanism for generating the curvature perturbation without slow - roll inflaton is quite important . in general , the superhorizon spectrum of perturbations is thought to be generated by the amplification of the quantum fluctuations of a light inflaton field , whose mass is much smaller than the hubble constant during inflation .",
    "this is because the quantum fluctuations of the field can reach and exit the horizon only if its compton wavelength is larger than the horizon during inflation .",
    "however , this happens only if the inflaton is effectively massless , i.e. only if @xmath0 .",
    "the above condition seems to conflict with our aim in this paper .",
    "luckily , we know alternatives for the slow - roll inflaton . the curvatons and their variants can generate the curvature perturbation after inflation@xcite , even if there is no slow - roll during inflation .",
    "however , this mechanism still requires flat direction that is supposed to have non - trivial properties .",
    "thus , we think it is still important to find models for generating the curvature perturbation without using neither slow - roll inflaton nor the curvatons .",
    "the situations that we will consider in this paper are both general and useful .",
    "our mechanism can be utilized in many kinds of phenomenological models in which slow - roll condition is inevitably violated . as we are considering inflation without slow - roll ,",
    "the e - foldings of our model may be short , which will require compensation by another period of inflationary expansion .",
    "consider two inflaton fields @xmath1 with a hybrid type of potential of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are taken to be real scalar fields .",
    "for later convenience , we introduce a field @xmath6 @xmath7 and mass @xmath8",
    "the above potential has global minima at @xmath9 and an unstable saddle point at @xmath10 one may be disappointed to see the above potential , since it looks quite similar to the one that has been used in usual hybrid inflation .",
    "however , we never assume slow - roll condition for the inflation field , except for `` built - in models '' that we will consider in sect.3.4    since the effective mass squared of the waterfall field @xmath5 is given by @xmath11 , the waterfall field @xmath5 remains at @xmath12 as far as the following condition is satisfied ; @xmath13 suppose that initially the system lies in the above region ( [ range ] ) and @xmath5 is at the quasi - stable point @xmath14 . in the case where the false vacuum density is dominated by a scalar potential @xmath15 and if @xmath16 , there would be a period of inflationary expansion even if there is no slow - roll inflaton field . during this period , according to the friedman equation , we have @xmath17 .",
    "since we are not expecting slow - roll inflation , the hubble constant during inflation can be much smaller than the masses of the fields @xmath18 . and @xmath19 .",
    "we know both fields may play the role of inflaton , however the actual e - foldings is almost determined by either field .",
    "thus , we use the word `` inflaton '' for the field that determines the total e - foldings . in this paper",
    ", we use the field @xmath20 as the inflaton . ] during the period of inflation , the klein - gordon equation for @xmath3 is @xmath21 where dots denote the derivatives with respect to the cosmic time @xmath22 .",

    "the background field dynamics is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24.\\ ] ] here the masses of the fields are denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the idea of fast - roll inflation is first advocated by linde in ref.@xcite . fast - roll inflation occurs during a period of inflation when the mass of the inflaton field is comparable to the hubble parameter . in our case , as suggested by eq.([kg - alpha ] ) , fast - roll occurs when @xmath26 there are two solutions to the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg - eq ] ) , both of which are exponentially decreasing with time . here",
    "we use the one with the negative sign , since the one with the opposite sign corresponds to the fast - decaying mode that rapidly disappears .",

    "it may be important to note that there is a significant discrepancy between the usual oscillation in locked models and the one considered in our model . in our case , oscillating field does not necessarily hit the core region ( i.e. @xmath40 ) during its oscillation .",

    "fluctuation of a light field is defined on any spacetime slicing and is almost massless .",
    "after horizon exit , the vacuum fluctuations have generated classical perturbations , which vary slowly on the hubble timescale and are expected to be gaussian .",
    "these classical perturbations have the spectrum @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the hubble constant @xmath59 at horizon exit .",

    "the novel possibility discussed in ref.@xcite is that @xmath70 depends on some other field @xmath71 whose potential is practically flat .",

    "note that @xmath99 parameterizes the time when fluctuations exit horizon . according to eq.([toy2eq ] ) , perturbations produced at later stages of elliptic inflation have much larger amplitudes in its spectrum , thus it has a blue spectrum .",
    "this is a problem for the people who want to generate the curvature perturbation only from elliptic inflation , while it seems a good idea to obtain a tilted spectrum , at least for the people who want to embed this idea into a model where the scale - invariant curvature perturbation is generated by another mechanism .",
    "for example , one may consider a model where slow - roll inflation occurs before elliptic inflation . we will discuss about this issue again in sect.3.4 .",
    "of course , it may be a good idea to obtain a tilted spectrum embedding this model into a scenario with the curvatons@xcite . in this case",
    ", one may assume that the large - scale perturbation is generated by the curvatons , while the perturbation generated by elliptic inflation becomes large in its short - scale side , thus generating a tilted spectrum .",
    "it would be useful to consider the opposite limit of @xmath85 , where the additional field @xmath19 is very massive .",
    "of course , we do know it is quite normal to think that an additional field can not play any role in generating the curvature perturbation if it is heavier than the inflaton field .",
    "however , this anticipation is not always true in our scenario .",

    "this result is quite interesting .",
    "we have obtained a blue spectrum in an inflationary scenario without slow - roll , by just adding a heavy field @xmath19 that couples very weakly to @xmath5 .",

    "although the expectation value of the heavy field @xmath19 may already be vanishing at the end of inflation and may not appear explicitly in the effective action at this time , one can not disregard the fluctuations induced by this field , which are generated and exited horizon during earlier period of inflation .    in some cases",
    ", one may consider fast - roll ( or locked ) inflation as a source for e - folds , while expecting that the curvature perturbation is produced by the curvatons .",

    "as we have seen above , a heavy field may oscillate at the beginning of inflation , producing a blue spectrum .",
    "in the large - scale side , the spectrum may be dominated by the curvature perturbation generated by the curvatons as expected , however its short - scale side may be dominated by the curvature perturbation generated at the end of fast - roll inflation .",
    "this scenario gives a tilted spectrum .",
    "as we have discussed above , it is not easy to obtain scale - invariant spectrum only from elliptic inflation .",
    "however , it would be interesting if elliptic inflation starts after a short period of slow - roll inflation .",
    "to illustrate our idea , let us assume that the ( scale - invariant ) perturbation is produced during a precedent stage of slow - roll inflation that generates minimum amount of e - foldings .",

    "we think it is quite natural to expect the occurrence of fast - roll ( or locked ) inflation after the period of conventional slow - roll inflation .",

    "this scale is equal to the hubble radius about nine e - foldings after our present hubble scale @xmath122 exit horizon .",
    "therefore , we need at least nine e - foldings of slow - roll expansion that generates scale - invariant spectrum , if it is to explain the observed large - scale structure .    then , it would be interesting if one can find signatures of the succeeding stage of ( secondary ) inflation from the intermediate - scale cosmological observations .",

    ". the mass of the waterfall field and the critical distance is determined by string dynamics on the branes , while the mass of inflaton ( i.e. the mass of the position moduli ) is determined by the global and local structure of the extra dimensions .",
    "although brane inflation is a promising idea that explains how inflation is realized in brane cosmology , it is known that obtaining successful flat direction is quite difficult@xcite . from the above viewpoints , it is important to examine if the curvature perturbation can be produced without slow - roll , at the same time without curvatons .",

    "the stabilization of the khler modulus leads to a vacuum with a negative cosmological constant , however the vacuum can be lifted by adding an @xmath140-brane that sits at the tip of the throat .",
    "an important consequence of the introduction of an @xmath140-brane to the warped background is the appearance of new moduli that correspond to the position of the @xmath140-brane on the compact space .",

    "@xmath141 is exact at the tip of the throat and the symmetry of @xmath141 is broken by placing the @xmath140-brane as @xmath142 , which gives rise to three massless moduli .",
    "the moduli correspond to the three coordinates of the position of the @xmath140-brane on the @xmath141 . in generic background",
    ", there would be corrections from the uv - boundary , the calabi - yau manifold , since the background deviates from the original ks solution away from the tip .",

    "although the deformation of the theory at the uv - side generates massses for the moduli , the highest contribution is exponentially smaller than the typical mass scale at the tip .",
    "therefore , in a brane inflationary scenario where the @xmath140-brane is fixed at the tip of the throat while the moving brane comes from the root , the fluctuation of the @xmath140-brane in the direction of @xmath141 becomes important . in our `` fast@xmath84flat scenario '' , the throat direction and the @xmath141 moduli correspond to the fields @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively .. ] thus , the fluctuation of @xmath140-brane at the tip can generate the curvature perturbation even if all the scalar fields parameterizing the position of the moving brane is lifted to have large masses .",
    "although it will be rather difficult to explain total e - foldings only from single - shot inflation , one may add secondary inflation that may take place after fast - roll inflation .",
    "thus , we can solve the eta - problem without using the curvatons .",
    "we think our idea is important in constructing inflationary models in kklt and other scenarios .",
    "( 400,330)(0,0 )",
    "the most important point is that an equipotential surface appears whenever there is additional inflaton that couples to waterfall field .",
    "fluctuation appears along the equipotential surface and exits horizon during inflation .",
    "the equipotential surface is an ellipsoid , along which fields can fluctuate despite the large mass of the fields .",
    "then , it induces fluctuation of the total number of e - folds at the end of inflation .",
    "the end line of hybrid inflation may also be ellipsoid , which becomes another source for the curvature perturbations .",
    "the spectrum of the curvature perturbation is determined by the masses and the couplings of the fields .    for brane inflationary models ,",
    "our mechanism provides us with a new inflationary scenario that circumvent the eta - problem .",
    "it is possible to generate the curvature perturbation even in a model where all flat directions are lifted at the uv side of the ks throat .",
    "it is also notable that our mechanism can be used to obtain a tilted spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is determined by the masses of the position moduli that parameterize the position of the inflationary branes .",
    "the mechanism may provide us with an important clue as to how one can obtain information about the structure of extra dimensions from cosmological observations .",
