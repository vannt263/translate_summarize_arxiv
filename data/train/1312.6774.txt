    "according to the famous result of l.poinsot @xcite , an arbitrary motion of a rigid body about a fixed point is represented by rolling without slipping of the moving hodograph of the angular velocity vector over the fixed hodograph of this vector .",
    "since these two curves viewed from the same space have at any time moment the common tangent line , the similar statement is valid also for the conical surfaces generated by the instant rotation axis , namely , the moving axoid is rolling without slipping over the fixed one .",
    "the point is that , in the purely rotational motion of a rigid body , the so - called relative and absolute time - derivatives of the angular velocity vector coincide .",
    "the general situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_poin ] . here",
    "@xmath0 is the angular velocity , @xmath1 stands for the relative time - derivative ( with respect to some reference frame strictly attached to the body ) and @xmath2 is the absolute time - derivative ( with respect to an inertial frame ) .        estimating his own work",
    ", poinsot wrote that `` it enables us to represent to ourselves the motion of a rigid body as clearly as that of a moving point '' . due to the problems of finding the fixed hodograph , poinsot gave only one representation of motion , namely , for the euler case of the body rotation without external forces .",
    "the classical integrable cases in the rigid body dynamics deal with the motions of a rigid body under the influence of axially symmetric potential fields ( the homogeneous gravity field , the central newtonian field ) .",
    "such systems are called _ reducible _ since the corresponding euler ",
    "poisson equations describe the motion up to rotations about the axis of the force symmetry and can be reduced to a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that while the moving hodograph is completely defined by the solution of the euler ",
    "poisson equations , the equations of the fixed hodograph must include an additional quadrature . the same problem arises for the solutions of the kirchhoff equations of rigid body motion in an ideal fluid , which also can be treated as the equations of a gyrostat motion about a fixed point .",
    "p.v.kharlamov @xcite proposed a natural way to find the fixed hodograph and to investigate its properties for all values of the existing parameters .",
    "this method is known as the hodographs method of the kinematic interpretation of motion and is based on applying some non - holonomic kinematic characteristics .",
    "if the solution of the euler  poisson equations is periodic , then the moving hodograph is , obviously , a closed curve . in this case",
    "the fixed hodograph , as a rule , densely fills a domain on a two - dimensional surface .",
    "p.v.kharlamov has shown that this surface is a surface of rotation with the meridian completely defined by the initial periodic solution by means of explicit functions and the missing angular coordinate of the fixed hodograph can be found by integrating the known function of time .",
    "the equations obtained in @xcite gave rise to geometric interpretations built for numerous cases of partial integrability ( see reviews in @xcite and the contemporary state of investigations in @xcite ) .    for an arbitrary motion in integrable reducible systems",
    "the moving hodograph in the generic case is a two - frequency vector function of time .",
    "therefore , the fixed hodograph for almost all initial data densely fills a three - dimensional region in space . in @xcite , i.n.gashenenko investigated the hodographs properties for quasi - periodic solutions in the classical cases of goryachev  chaplygin and kovalevskaya . using the equations of the paper @xcite and the ideas of the number theory and fourier analysis , gashenenko described those classes of non - resonant motions in the integrable reducible rigid body systems for which the components of the angular velocity in the inertial space also are two - periodic functions of time or , in other words , one - valued functions on the corresponding regular liouville torus ( on the connected component of a regular integral manifold of the euler  poisson equations ) bearing trajectories with irrational rotation number .",
    "the motion is represented by rolling of one surface `` through '' another in such a way that a curve dense in the first surface rolls without slipping over a similar curve dense in the second surface . still such motions are destroyed by a small perturbation of the integral constants .    in this paper , we consider the case when the force field does not have any symmetry axis .",
    "the system then can not be globally reduced to two degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , in integrable systems the motions consisting of the points where the first integrals are dependent play the most important role in the topological analysis of the initial system as a whole , and their geometry can present , clearly enough , the separating cases for different types of the body rotation .",
    "such critical motions are organized into invariant four - dimensional manifolds on which the induced dynamics correspond to hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom called critical subsystems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "regular integral manifolds of the critical subsystems consist of two - dimensional tori ( liouville tori ) and both hodographs belong to the two - dimensional surfaces obtained as images of the corresponding torus under projections from the 6-dimensional phase space onto three - dimensional spaces of the angular velocities ( with respect to the rotating body and to some inertial frame ) . for non - resonant cases the hodographs are dense in these surfaces .",
    "the explicit solutions of the critical subsystems allow us to obtain an immediate computer visualization of the surfaces bearing the hodographs .",
    "below we illustrate this process for one of the known systems in the generalized kovalevskaya case .",
    "simultaneously , we propose another way to describe the body s motion by presenting it as a composition of some simple motions .",
    "this composition is based strictly on the known separation of variables .",
    "we now consider the system with two degrees of freedom found in @xcite .",
    "its explicit algebraic solution in separated variables and the rough topological analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "let us write out the solution in a slightly different form convenient for the purposes of this paper .",
    "suppose that the rigid body with the inertia tensor of the kovalevskaya type is placed in two linearly independent homogeneous force fields with the centers of application of the fields in the equatorial plane of the body .",
    "let @xmath3  be the fixed point and @xmath4 the orthonormal basis of the principal inertia axes .",
    "the inertia tensor after choosing the dimensionless values becomes @xmath5 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the forces can always be supposed orthogonal and the centers of application can be taken on the principal inertia axes pointed out from @xmath3 by the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the unit direction vectors of the intensities of the force fields fixed in the inertial space and represented by their components in the moving frame @xmath10 .",
    "then the geometric integrals take the form @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the total energy of the system ( the hamilton function ) is @xmath14 the scalar characteristics of the force fields without loss of generality can be chosen to satisfy the condition @xmath15 .",
    "let us note that in the boundary cases @xmath16 and @xmath17 the problem becomes reducible ( the classical kovalevskaya case and the case of h.m.yehia @xcite with an additional linear integral of a special structure ) .",
    "for arbitrary values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 the integrability of the whole irreducible system with three degrees of freedom is proved in @xcite . out of two parameters",
    "@xmath20 only one is essential , but we keep both to deal with more symmetric expressions .    the space of the variables @xmath21 is 6-dimensional in virtue of the geometric integrals . in the paper",
    "@xcite two invariant relations are found which define the system considered here . in the sequel , for the sake of brevity we speak about the system @xmath22 , meaning the corresponding invariant four - dimensional manifold together with the induced dynamics on it .",

    "the obtained expressions , give rise to the decomposition of the type with the matrices @xmath95 obviously , with respect to the body the motion of the semi - moving basis is of pendulum type with the axis of the pendulum coinciding with the dynamical symmetry axis @xmath96 .",

    "therefore , the character of the pendulum motions is defined by the scalar multiple in the right - hand sided .",
    "the motion @xmath86 is more complicated .",
    "let us calculate for it the angular velocities of the partial motions : @xmath103 since in the first partial motion @xmath104 , it is a pendulum type motion with the axis in the plane @xmath105 . in the second partial motion @xmath106 .",
    "then it is also a pendulum type motion but with the axis in the plane @xmath107 .",
    "more detailed statements on these motions will be obtained from the segments of oscillation of the separating variables and the corresponding evolution of the radicals @xmath34 .",

    "nevertheless , it is necessary to make some remarks .",
    "it is clear from  that the variables @xmath25 oscillate in the segments defined by the inequalities @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , which in addition to the restrictions give @xmath112 here @xmath113 are the roots of @xmath114 .",
    "the segments of oscillation are usually called the accessible regions .",
    "they depend on the integral constants . if the integral constants are fixed and both @xmath115 and @xmath116 are chosen strictly inside their accessible regions , the arbitrary signs of @xmath34 define 16 points on the integral manifold projecting to the point @xmath117 .",
    "some of them belong to the same connected component .",
    "if , for example , the accessible region for @xmath118 is @xmath119 $ ] , then each time the variable reaches the end of the segment the corresponding algebraic value @xmath120 or @xmath121 changes its sign .",
    "the radicals which are not involved in the definition of the accessible region keep constant sign along the considered trajectory .",
    "the choice of these constant signs affects the choice of the connected component of the integral manifold ( see @xcite ) . fixing these signs and making obvious trigonometric substitutions",
    "we express the components of @xmath58 and @xmath59 given by and as one - valued functions of some angular coordinates on the chosen liouville torus .",
    "this gives us an explicit parametrization of the bearing surfaces .",
    "still there is another problem specific for the investigated system @xmath22 .",
    "while for @xmath116 the accessible region is always contained in the bounded segment @xmath122 $ ] , the variable @xmath115 for @xmath123 periodically crosses the infinity .",
    "indeed , in this case the right - hand part of the first equation is the square root of the polynomial of degree 4 with positive principal coefficient .",
    "formally speaking , all corresponding singularities in the expressions for the phase variables are removable and the sign of @xmath124 has no influence on the phase topology . but from the point of view of computation algorithms , to obtain continuous functions we need , each time when @xmath115 crosses the infinity , to change the signs of @xmath125 and @xmath126 . in @xcite , for the purpose of the topological analysis this problem is solved by introducing the new values @xmath127 they do not change signs at @xmath128 since @xmath115 jumps from @xmath129 to @xmath130 . here",
    "we use the same approach and make trigonometric substitutions for the variable @xmath131 , which oscillates in a bounded region .",
    "the complete information on the accessible regions is collected in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath132 sign attached to the notation of some cameras show the part of the camera with corresponding sign of @xmath124 ( see fig .  [ fig_bifnum ] ) .",

    "let us use the obtained above decomposition of motions and point out some properties of the arising pendulum type motions . to this end , we write @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 from , substituting",
    ". then we have @xmath139 it follows from table  1 that @xmath140 periodically changes its sign in the cameras @xmath141 and has constant sign in @xmath142 .",

    "in particular , in all cameras the products @xmath150 and @xmath151 change the sign periodically .",
    "this means that , for the semi - moving frame its pendulum motion is always an _",

    "the motions of the body in the semi - moving frame are superpositions of two partial motions ; each partial motion is of pendulum type .",
