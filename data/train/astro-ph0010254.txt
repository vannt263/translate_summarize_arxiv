    "photometric searches over wide areas for rare , distant giants in the galactic halo are now a reality , thanks to the advent of wide - field ccd systems .",
    "one particularly useful photometric system is the washington system @xcite . since @xcite added the ddo `` 51 '' filter to allow discrimination between late - type dwarfs and giants and re - calibrated its [ fe / h ]  indicator , this system has steadily gained in popularity .",
    "its broad - band filters and strong abundance sensitivity for late - type giants @xcite mean that it was well - suited to studies of objects of known distance such as open and globular cluster giants . in these cases there is little need for luminosity discrimination .    however , when seeking rare objects such as halo giants , which are seen through a thick veil of foreground disk stars , luminosity discrimination is vital .",
    "the mg  @xmath1/mgh feature near 5170  is strong in late - type dwarfs and weak in giants .",
    "the `` 51 '' filter ( with @xmath2 = 5130  and @xmath3 = 154 ) is centered on this feature .",
    "it works well for discriminating between late g / k dwarfs of solar or near - solar metallicity and g / k giants .",
    "the addition of this filter has allowed the use of the washington system in surveys for late g and k giants where foreground contamination by disk dwarfs is a problem .",
    "this is superior to other photometric methods of identifying giants such as ddo or strmgren photometry @xcite because only one filter has a narrow passband , and it it not necessary to observe in the ultraviolet .",
    "surveys well - suited to the washington system include :    * studies of giant stars in clusters at low latitude , where it is now possible to remove foreground dwarf non - members ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) * surveys for rare field giants of the outer halo ( morrison et al .  2000a , paper i hereafter ; majewski et al .",
    "2000b ) * surveys for extra - tidal giants from galactic dwarf satellites @xcite    the last two types of survey make contributions to our understanding of the formation and subsequent evolution of the galaxy .",
    "distant halo field giants , such as the one recently discovered by our survey at 90 kpc @xcite provide in - situ probes of the outer halo , and are also important probes of the galactic potential @xcite . but their identification as giants must be solid in order to make them useful",
    " the spatial distribution and kinematics of local halo dwarfs will contribute little to our understanding of the outer galaxy .",
    "indeed , misidentification will lead to serious errors .",
    "we began work on this paper in order to understand our low success rate at identifying halo giants for @xmath0 magnitudes fainter than 18 .",
    "for brighter magnitudes our success rate , confirmed by spectroscopic follow - up , is better than 90% , but this falls precipitously to 24% for @xmath0 magnitudes between 18 and 19 @xcite , despite comparably good mean photometric uncertainties for these fainter stars .",
    "a detailed investigation into the limitations of the washington luminosity classification may also cast light on some surprising claims from the surveys around dwarf satellites of the milky way .",
    "for example , @xcite have claimed detection of large numbers of extra - tidal stars in the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy . such a large extra - tidal population , if confirmed , has implications not only for galaxy evolution but also for our understanding of the dark matter content of the dsph satellites . however , these surveys extend to much fainter magnitudes than previously possible , and it is important to understand possible contamination by foreground and background objects , and the role of photometric errors , at such faint levels .",
    "our essential result is that there are two major problems with the washington luminosity classification : first , very metal - poor foreground subdwarfs are indistinguishable photometrically from halo giants ; second , photometric errors can scatter disk dwarfs into the halo giant region of the 2/51 diagnostic plot .    in section 2",
    "we discuss possible contaminants of halo giant candidates in the 2/51 diagram : disk and halo dwarfs , galaxies and qsos . with accurate 51 photometry ,",
    "the only serious contaminants are the very metal - poor halo dwarfs whose weak lines make them indistinguishable photometrically from halo giants .",
    "we derive a luminosity function specifically for such metal - poor halo dwarfs and use it , with a simple halo model , to predict the number of subdwarfs per deg@xmath4  in different directions in the galaxy .",
    "although foreground disk and thick disk dwarfs are neglible contaminants if accurate photometry is obtained , the high density of these stars , especially at low latitudes , makes the number scattered into the giant region of the 2/51  diagram a sensitive function of photometric error . in section 3",
    "we investigate this in detail , and describe the double effect of large errors on giant searches : not only are dwarfs scattered into the giant region , but genuine giants are scattered out .    in section 4 we use what we have learned about giant selection to examine our own pencil - beam survey of at high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "the btc subset ( obtained using the big throughput camera on the ctio 4 m in april 1999 ) covers 12.7 square degrees , and has spectroscopic follow - up of approximately half of the giant candidates @xcite .",
    "we find that foreground subdwarfs are the principal cause of our low detection efficiency for giants below @xmath5 , and describe our plans to optimize future searches for the faint , red giants of the extreme outer halo so that fewer subdwarfs are misidentified as giants .    in section 5",
    "we discuss the survey of @xcite ( mopkjg hereafter ) of approximately two square degrees centered on the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "their study found a large number ( @xmath6100 ) of giant candidates outside the tidal radius of @xcite , but they were only able to obtain follow - up spectra of three of the brightest extra - tidal candidates .",
    "the photometric errors of the mpokjg data are more typical of photographic than of ccd photometry , and we discuss the possible effect of these errors on the giant selection .",
    "@xcite showed the sensitivity of the 51 index to luminosity for late g and k stars , and this was confirmed and expanded by @xcite using synthetic spectra .",
    "the index loses sensitivity to luminosity blueward of 2 = 1.1 .",
    "it holds almost no luminosity information blueward of 2 = 1.0 , due to the disappearance of the mgh feature in dwarfs at this temperature .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure 7 of @xcite for @xmath70.4 ( 2 @xmath8 ) .",
    "the 51 index works well for discrimination between halo giants and foreground dwarfs of the thin and thick disk ( mean [ fe / h ] of 0.2 and 0.5 , @xcite ) .",
    "the separation between the [ fe / h]= 0.5 dwarf and the [ fe / h]= 1.0 giant lines ranges from 0.075 to 0.23 mags at 2 = 1.1 and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "only large photometric errors ( explored further in section 3 below ) will cause thin or thick disk dwarfs to appear in the giant region .",
    "we define our giant selection region as that bounded by 2 = 1.1 ( where the index loses sensitivity ) and 1.8 ( where the washington abundance calibration stops ) and 51 = 0.02 and 0.09 , but excluding the area below the line between ( 2,51 ) = ( 1.1,0.02 ) and ( 1.2,0.02 ) .",
    "( the giant selection region is illustrated below in figures [ badphot ] and [ dwarflines ] .",
    "as we noted in paper i , metal - poor dwarfs of [ fe / h]@xmath9 2.0 overlap the giant region in the 51 vs. 2 diagram , and follow - up spectroscopy is needed to weed them from the sample .",
    "few bright examples of such stars are known , due to their intrinsic rarity and low luminosity , and at the time of writing paper i we had only obtained spectra of one such star , g30 - 52 , [ fe / h]=2.06 , @xcite , which lies at the extreme blue end of our selection region . since then we have obtained spectra of several more very metal - poor k dwarfs , which are shown in figure [ subdwarfs ] .",

    "this star is particularly useful for calibrating our survey because of its relatively cool temperature ( ( ) @xmath10=1.0 , using the reddening estimates of @xcite and the photometry of @xcite ) . at first sight",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the spectra of g160 - 30 and that of a very metal - poor giant such as ngc 5053-d ( see figure 3 of paper i ) .",
    "we will discuss this further in @xcite , where we will show that the ratio of strengths of neutral and ionized ca lines discriminates between such giants and dwarfs in spectra of sufficient s / n .    in paper i we made an estimate of the number of subdwarfs with [ fe / h]less than 2.0 in our survey s magnitude range using the bahcall - soniera model @xcite scaled by the proportion of halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath11 2.0 . in the appendix",
    "we derive a luminosity function ( lf ) specifically for the halo subdwarfs which appear in our giant selection region .",
    "since the determination of the halo field lf of @xcite only contains 51 stars over all abundances in the absolute magnitude range of interest , we can not derive an accurate lf from the metal - poor subset of the @xcite data .",
    "thus we choose to use accurate lfs constructed from hst observations of four very metal - poor globular clusters , and use the hst color - magnitude diagram of ngc 6397 @xcite to transform from @xmath12 to @xmath13  and hence 2 .",

    ", this corresponds to distances up to 2.5 kpc from the sun .",
    "our halo dwarf model assumes the luminosity function given in the appendix in table [ lftable ] .",
    "the halo s spatial distribution is modelled using a power - law exponent of 3.0 and a moderate flattening of b / a=0.6  values confirmed by halo turnoff stars found in our survey @xcite .",
    "figure [ subdmodel ] shows its predictions for our giant selection box .",
    "the number of subdwarfs is a strong function of magnitude , reaching tens per deg@xmath4  for @xmath16 .",
    "= ( 0,45 ) , middle line for @xmath17=(90,45 ) and bottom line for @xmath17=(180,45 ) .",
    "there is less dependence on galactic latitude than longitude , as the @xmath18 density law of the halo contributes most strongly to the increase in counts in fields towards the galactic center .",
    "[ subdmodel ] ]      since up to 50% of all stars may be binaries , it is worth considering whether two stars in a binary system can masquerade as a single giant .",
    "this is trivially true of a binary system consisting of a giant and a faint dwarf companion , since the giant luminosity will dominate .",
    "however , it is a little less clear whether a binary system composed of two main sequence stars could have 2  and 51 colors within the giant region .    to test this we took the synthetic 2  and 51  colors of @xcite and of @xcite for stars with @xmath19 ranging from 4000 to 10000 k , @xmath20 from 4.5 to 0.7 , and [ fe / h ]  from 0 to 1.0 , and combined them into simulated binary systems using the absolute magnitudes given in @xcite . since @xcite only give colors for stars from 4000 to 7000 k , and @xcite does not give 51  colors , we set the 51  color of all stars hotter than 7000k at 0.017 , which is the color expected for a spectrum with no features in the mg  @xmath1/mgh region .",
    "the only stars for which the binary system had both 2  _ and _ 51  in our giant region were those for which one component of the binary system already had colors within the giant region . this is because ( 1 ) the bluer component of a binary made of two main sequence stars will be brighter and so dominate the 2  color , and ( 2 ) it is not possible in a spectrum without emission lines to have 51  significantly higher than 0.017 unless one star is extremely metal - poor .",
    "thus contamination by binary stars whose constituent stars are both on the main sequence is negligible .      because of the emission lines and redshifted features in galaxy and qso spectra , they can be found both in the giant region of the 51/2  plot , and also in regions not occupied by normal stars . the synthetic 51 colors of @xcite for very metal - poor stars reach no higher than 51=0.05 , corresponding to the value that a blackbody spectrum would have .",
    "thus , apart from photometric errors , we would not expect to see any normal or metal - poor stars with 51 @xmath21 0.05 .",
    "the only other possibility is a spectrum which has _",
    "less _ light , on average , in the wider m band than in the narrow 51 band close to its center .",
    "this can happen if absorption lines in a galaxy s spectrum are redshifted into the m band , or if an emission line in a galaxy or qso spectrum is redshifted into the 51 band .",
    "figure [ qso ] shows the spectrum of a bal qso identified in our survey , with the @xmath22 and 51 filter passbands overlaid .",
    "the qso spectrum is , to first order , featureless over the @xmath22 passband , although part of the broad emission line at the blue end of the 51 passband would have been included in this filter s observations , giving the same or slightly more light per   in the 51 filter than the wider @xmath22 band .     and narrower 51 passbands overlaid .",
    "the qso s relatively featureless spectrum across the @xmath22 passband , and the broad emission line at the blue end of the 51 band , contribute to its position in the giant box of the 2/51  diagram .",
    "[ qso ] ]    in addition , the washington colors of some normal galaxies are similar to those of metal - poor stars , so we will find a small number of galaxies in other regions of the 2 vs. 51 diagram .",
    "our survey uses data from mosaic ccd cameras ( the big throughput camera and the noao mosaics ) on the kpno and ctio 4 m telescopes and the burrell schmidt .",
    "we are particularly vulnerable to contamination by galaxies in our schmidt data , where the large pixels make it more difficult to distinguish between stars and galaxies .",
    "there is still a small chance of contamination by compact galaxies and qsos even in our better - sampled btc and mosaic data .",
    "we discuss this further in section 4 .",
    "use of the 51 index for luminosity classification requires accurate colors for two reasons .",
    "first , the separation between giants and dwarfs in the 51 vs. 2 plot is not large : @xmath6 0.15 mag between solar abundance dwarfs and giants for 2 @xmath21 1.3 ( @xmath21 1.0 ) and less for bluer stars .",
    "although metal - poor giants lie further away from the dwarf locus because of their weak mg  @xmath1  lines , this advantage is offset by the fact that as we move to fainter magnitudes , foreground dwarfs become dominated by thick disk stars , whose lower metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath23 , @xcite ) moves them toward the giant region .",
    "second , distant giants are strongly outnumbered by foreground disk stars , so we need to cope with the effect of 2@xmath24 and even 3@xmath24 errors on the dwarf colors .",
    "we use the accurate washington photometry obtained with the big throughput camera ( btc ) on the ctio 4 m telescope in april 1999 @xcite to illustrate the effect of photometric errors on giant / dwarf classification .",
    "this pencil - beam data covers 12.7 square degrees , with latitude ranging from @xmath1 = 25 to 72 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the median error in 2 was 0.012 mag , and for 51 , 0.013 mag .",
    "we chose a subset of these data with low errors using a magnitude range of @xmath25 and a maximum error of 0.02 mag in both 2 and 51 .",
    "this subset will be used as an approximation of `` zero - error '' data which will then be degraded with successively larger photometric errors by adding a number chosen from a gaussian error distribution .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ badphot ] shows these data , with the regions used by our collaboration and @xcite(mokp hereafter ) for giant selection marked .",
    "our giant region is significantly smaller and does not extend as far blueward as the mokp region .",
    "it can be seen that the most numerous stars in this color range have 2 between 0.7 and 1.2 ( @xmath6 0.50.9 ) .",
    "these stars are mostly disk dwarfs @xcite .    we simulated photometric errors by adding gaussian errors to the observed colors in this low - error subset .",
    "the color error in 51 and in 2 was chosen randomly from a gaussian distribution with either @xmath24 = 0.05 ( middle panel ) and 0.10 ( right - hand panel ) mags .",
    "it can be seen that even 0.05 mag color errors move stars into both `` giant '' boxes , in particular into the region of the mokp box with 2 @xmath11 1.0 .",
    "color errors of 0.10 mag produce large numbers of bogus giants .      to quantify the effect of photometric errors on our giant classifications , we need to explore two effects : genuine giants removed from the giant region , and dwarfs and other stars scattered into the giant region by color errors .",

    "[ losegiants ] ]    the first effect is simpler to quantify because it does not depend on the position in the galaxy of the field surveyed .",

    "figure [ losegiantsumm ] summarizes the percentage of giants lost due to errors , as a function of the color error .",
    "it can be seen that even for color errors as low as 0.02 mag , around 20% of genuine giants will be lost .",
    "the most numerous ( and least luminous ) giant stars lie close to the blue boundary of our giant box at 2 = 1.1 , and the majority of stars will be lost from this region .",
    "this effect , and its dependence on color and absolute magnitude , will need to be taken into account when using halo giants found with 51 to measure the density distribution of the outer halo .    ]",
    "the leakage of foreground dwarfs into the giant regions is more complex to quantify , as it depends on the numbers of dwarfs close to the boundaries of the giant box .",
    "this is a strong function of galactic latitude in particular , since the path length of lower - latitude lines of sight through the disk is higher .",

    "the absence of error cuts is because we need to measure how many dwarf stars are in the correct color and magnitude ranges to be moved into the giant region via photometric errors , and limiting the data selected via our errors will lead to incompleteness in our sample .",

    "assigning the correct percentage of `` no giant candidate '' fields to the spectroscopic follow - up group , we find that 4.45 square degrees have been completely surveyed for giants .",
    "this gives a subdwarf frequency of 1.8@xmath310.6 per square degree .",
    "the fields with complete spectroscopic follow - up have a mean ( l , b ) = ( 281,47 ) , so the middle line in figure [ subdmodel ] is a good match .",
    "this predicts 2.6 subdwarfs per square degree in our giant selection box down to @xmath0=19 , in good agreement with our actual value , once errors in the local halo density are taken into account .    in summary ,",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up has confirmed the importance of accurate photometry for giant selection using the washington system . in addition , the number of subdwarfs found in our fields is in agreement with the predictions of the model described in section 2.2.1 and the appendix . particularly for @xmath0 magnitudes fainter than 18 ,",
    "_ photometric identification of halo giants is not enough _ : spectroscopic confirmation of their luminosity is very important .",
    "if we observe every giant candidate that appears in the giant region of figure [ dwarflines ] ( see appendix ) spectroscopically for v fainter than 18 , we will find three subdwarfs for every genuine halo giant .",
    "the stars that are of particular interest in this magnitude range are the high - luminosity giants which help trace the extreme outer halo , like our star l304.49b+60.51 @xcite . with accurate photometry , it is possible to make our spectroscopic follow - up more efficient by utilizing the sensitivity of the 51 color to luminosity .",
    "figure [ redgiants ] shows the halo giants and subdwarfs identified by spectroscopic follow - up , with giants coded by absolute magnitude .",
    "it can be seen that the most luminous giants are not only the reddest , but also occupy the upper region of the giant box , with 51 @xmath21 0.01 , while the subdwarfs cluster toward the bottom left .    for our survey , if we restrict our giant selection box to the upper right of the original region for @xmath32 , we are able to optimize our efficiency of giant selection without missing any of the most distant giants in our sample . for data that reach fainter levels , this `` new , clean '' region becomes contaminated with intrinsically fainter , redder subdwarfs .    , small closed circles are giants with @xmath33 , large closed circles are giants with @xmath34 .",

    "outside _ the tidal radius of @xcite .",
    "these stars range in magnitude from @xmath35=17.820.8 ( @xmath3717.520.5 ) .",
    "they obtained confirmatory spectroscopy of three of the brightest extratidal giant candidates , which are 1.4@xmath24 , 1.4@xmath24 and 2.3@xmath24 outside the @xcite tidal radius , using their quoted error of 3.6 arcmin .",
    "based on the number of extratidal giant candidates , they derive a surprisingly high mass - loss rate : 27% of the total mass of carina per gyr .    because their survey covers a relatively small area , contamination by subdwarfs in their giant region is not a significant problem .",
    "we make a conservative estimate of the number of subdwarfs in their giant region by using the luminosity function derived in the appendix for our smaller giant region : the halo model predicts that 14 subdwarfs will be found per square degree to v=20.5 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "carina has quite a low galactic latitude ( @xmath39 ) so there are large numbers of disk stars in the foreground , and the potential exists for a significant number to scatter into the giant region of the 2/51 diagram .",
    "the accuracy of the @xcite photometry is not high .",
    "this is caused in great part by their short exposure times : their c40 telescope exposure times in @xmath22 and @xmath40 were almost the same as our 4 m btc exposure times , 15 times shorter when the difference in aperture is taken into account .",
    "( their 51 exposures were a factor of @xmath63 shorter after correcting for telescope aperture . )",
    "mopkjg work more than a magnitude fainter than our survey , to @xmath41 ( @xmath3720.5 ) .",
    "in addition , the c100 data suffered from such large psf variations that even a quadratic variable psf in daophot was unable to completely correct them .    to deal with these large errors they restrict consideration to stars with errors in all filters less than 0.10 mag . thus it is possible for stars with color errors as high as 0.14 mag in 51  or 2to be included in their sample . in figure [ srmbal ]",
    "we showed that at latitudes of 3040 degrees , significantly higher than the latitude of carina , almost 200 dwarf stars per square degree are scattered into the mokp giant box for color errors of 0.10 mag .",
    "thus the additional cut using the carina giant branch is very important .",
    "mopkjg estimate the contribution of `` background '' objects by successively displacing the carina giant branch region to _",
    "brighter _ magnitudes , and counting how many stars which satisfy their 51/2cut are found in the shifted giant branch region .",
    "their decision to only shift the box to brighter magnitudes is forced upon them by the serious incompleteness of their photometry at magnitudes fainter than m=20.8 .",
    "this is unfortunate , because the number of interlopers in the giant region increases sharply at fainter magnitudes , so their background estimates will be systematically too small .",
    "the magnitude range of interest for carina giants is @xmath35=17.820.8 . here , the majority of the c100 photometry has errors ranging up to 0.15 mag in @xmath22 and 51 and 0.25 mag in @xmath40 .",
    "the c40 data has larger errors : up to 0.40 mag in 51 , 0.25 mag in @xmath40 and 0.3 mag in @xmath22 . with an error cut of 0.10 mag per filter and a significant number of stars having errors in each filter close to this number , color errors of up to 0.14 mag are likely .",
    "we have extended our simulations of the likely number of foreground dwarfs that will be moved into the mokp giant selection box in the 51/2  diagram by adding the same selection as was used by mopkjg ( the cmd bounding box outlined in their figure 8) to isolate stars at the right color and magnitude to be on carina s giant branch .",
    "figure [ carinadwarfs ] shows our results .",
    "it can be seen that with color errors in the range of 0.05 to 0.10 mag , dwarf contamination is significantly higher than that claimed by mopkjg , whose largest extratidal background estimate was 22 stars per square degree .",
    "even the extra cut using the position of carina s red giant branch would not rid the extratidal giant sample of many interlopers .",
    "diagrams , as a function of photometric error , for m magnitudes brighter than 20.8 .",
    "mopkjg s estimated background level and number of extratidal giants per square degree are also shown with straight lines , dashed and solid respectively .",
    "[ carinadwarfs ] ]    in summary , more spectroscopic follow - up is needed to confirm the claim of @xcite that carina is losing 27% of its mass per gyr . with photometric errors of 0.10 mag , the typical star in the giant region",
    "will be a photometric error .",
    "brighter stars , such as the three observed spectroscopically , will have smaller photometric errors and will in general be giants if they are in the giant region .",
    "however , only one of these is more than 2@xmath24 away from the @xcite tidal radius .",
    "a larger spectroscopic sample is needed .",
    "the discovery of one extratidal bright giant tells us nothing about the discovery fraction of fainter giants .",
    "washington photometry , with the addition of the 51 filter , is a powerful method of finding distant halo giants .",
    "we find that at the faintest magnitudes probed by our survey , our giant selection efficiency falls , and we make a careful examination of possible problems with the washington giant classification to improve future surveys .",
    "we show that accurate photometry ( color errors less than 0.03 mag ) is essential to cut down on the scattering of the numerous foreground dwarfs into the giant region in the 51/2  color - color plot .",
    "we have made estimates of the contamination of giant candidates by very metal - poor halo dwarfs by deriving a new luminosity function specifically for the subdwarfs which mimic halo giants in the 51/2  diagram , and using it in a simple halo model .",
    "we used our results on luminosity discrimination with the washington system to examine two recent surveys : our own survey of 12.7 square degrees at high galactic latitudes @xcite , and the study of @xcite of fields centered on the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy , which finds over 100 carina - associated giant candidates outside its tidal radius .    for surveys such as our own of the halo field ,",
    "very metal - poor halo dwarfs are the major source of contamination of candidate giant samples , and we propose using a smaller region of the 51/2diagram to optimise spectroscopic follow - up at the faint magnitudes where the subdwarfs dominate .",
    "the survey of @xcite has spectroscopic follow - up only for three of the brightest `` extra - tidal '' giant candidates , and we show that their photometric errors , which will increase as stars become fainter , can have a very serious effect on their giant classification .    in summary ,",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of giant stars identified using the washington system is vital .",
    "if one wishes to make statistical corrections for the number of bogus giants caused by photometric errors , it is important to quantify accurately the photometric errors in the data , both in terms of the size of the average error and the shape of the distribution .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , bruce carney , for helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grants ast 96 - 19490 to hlm , ast 95 - 28367 , ast96 - 19632 and ast98 - 20608 to mm , and ast 96 - 19524 to ewo .",
    "we have derived a luminosity function ( lf ) for halo g and k dwarfs with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 2.0 using lfs for four metal - poor globular clusters derived from hst wfpc2 color - magnitude diagrams by @xcite , and the splendid @xmath0,@xmath13  color - magnitude diagram of ngc6397 of @xcite , transformed to the standard landolt system using the transformations of @xcite .",
    "we need to derive a lf separately for the metal - poor stars ",
    "its slope will be different for the halo as a whole and for its most metal - poor stars .",
    "this can be seen in the compilation of accurate globular cluster lfs of @xcite , where for @xmath42=58 , clusters such as ngc6397 have relatively more stars at the faint end than metal - richer clusters such as ngc6752 and ngc104 .",
    "also , since we are interested in the luminosity distribution at a given color , we need to use the color - magnitude diagram of a metal - poor cluster to decide which absolute magnitudes appear in our 2 color range for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath11 2.0 , where our ability to discriminate them via 51 begins to fail .    although it would be more direct to use a subsample of the @xcite field star data with [ fe / h]@xmath43 to derive this lf , the @xcite sample is too small .",
    "it is based on only 51 stars in our magnitude range of interest ( @xmath12=69 ) , and is particularly poorly sampled at the bright end .",
    "thus we use accurate lfs derived from hst photometry of metal - poor globular clusters , where there are sufficient stars to remove concerns about poisson counting errors .",
    "we first compare the lf from a cluster with a similar [ fe / h ]  to the mean of the halo field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 6752 ) with the @xcite halo field lf to check for cluster - field differences , as halo field stars may not have formed under identical conditions to globular clusters .",
    "( the cluster was observed near its half - light radius where mass segregarion effects are minimal . )",
    "it can be seen in figure [ lfs ] that these two lfs are very similar .",
    "we then proceed to construct our metal - poor halo lf using the clusters m15 , m30 , m92 and ngc6397 ( whose [ fe / h ] values range from 1.9 to 2.2 , zinn 1985 )",
    ". @xcite compare the lfs of their four globular clusters and note that three ( m15 , m30 and m92 ) are in good agreement , while the lf of ngc 6397 has fewer stars for @xmath44 than the other clusters .",
    "they calculate multi - mass king models in order to check whether corrections are needed to convert their local lfs to global ones , and conclude that any corrections will not exceed one or two tenths in the logarithm .",
    "thus , since @xcite were unable to relate the only difference in the lf slopes to mass segregation effects , we choose to simply average the four lfs .",
    "figure [ lfs ] shows this lf , compared to that of @xcite for halo field stars , calculated with a `` discovery fraction '' of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the cluster lfs were normalized to agree with the @xcite lf for @xmath12=68 . as expected , the metal - poor lf has more stars at the faint end than the @xcite lf and the ngc 6752 one .      with this luminosity function ,",
    "it is possible to predict numbers of k dwarfs with [ fe / h]@xmath11 2.0 in the color range corresponding to our giant box , as a function of magnitude and position in the galaxy .",
    "for relatively bright stars ( @xmath15 ) we only probe out to distances of 3 kpc at most . as in paper",
    "i , we used the metallicity distribution of @xcite to determine that 31% of halo dwarfs have [ fe / h]@xmath11 2.0 .",
    "the rare subdwarfs with [ fe / h]@xmath93.0 , such as g160 - 30 , are of particular concern to us because it requires higher signal - to - noise in the follow - up spectrum to determine whether the star is a dwarf or giant .",
    "we used the metallicity distribution of @xcite , which is complete for metallicities below 2.0 , and contains 4754 stars in total , to determine that 3% of all halo dwarfs have [ fe / h]@xmath9 3.0 .",
    "( within the errors , this is consistent with the result of @xcite . )",
    "it can be seen in figure [ dwarflines ] , which shows the synthetic colors of @xcite for dwarfs of different metallicity , that our giant selection box overlaps the [ fe / h ] = 2.0 subdwarfs only at its blue end ( 2 = 1.11.3 ) and overlaps the [ fe / h]=3.0 lines for a larger color interval ( 2 = 1.1  1.6 ) . in other words , for the coolest k dwarfs in our color range , the mg lines are sufficiently strong that only the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath93.0 ) appear in our giant selection box , while for the warmer k dwarfs , the lines are weaker and so stars with [ fe / h]@xmath92.0 appear in our giant selection box .",
    "we took this into account in the construction of the luminosity function for the halo subdwarf model , by scaling the numbers of dwarfs with bluer colors ( brighter absolute magnitudes ) by 31% and those with redder colors ( fainter absolute magnitudes ) by 3% .",
    "table [ lftable ] gives the luminosity function for metal - poor subdwarfs derived from the clusters in @xcite , and the luminosity function specifically calculated to match the number of metal - poor dwarfs that will appear in our giant box .",
