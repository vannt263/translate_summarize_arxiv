    "directed brownian motion induced by zero - mean non - equilibrium fluctuations in the absence of macroscopic forces and potential gradients is presently under intense investigation @xcite .",
    "this comes from the desire to understand unidirectional transport in biological systems@xcite , as well as their potential technological applications ranging from classical non - equilibrium models@xcite to quantum systems@xcite .",
    "a ratchet system is generally defined as a system that is able to transport particles in a periodic structure with nonzero macroscopic velocity in the absence of macroscopic force on average . broadly speaking , ratchet devices fall into three categories depending on how the applied perturbation couples to the substrate asymmetry : rocking ratchets@xcite",
    ", flashing ratchets@xcite , and correlation ratchets @xcite .",
    "additionally , entropic ratchets , in which brownian particles move in a confined structure , instead of a potential , were also extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "these studies on directed transport of the brownian particles focused on the normal diffusion . + however",
    ", anomalous diffusion has attracted growing attention , being observed in various fields of physics and related sciences@xcite .",
    "description of physical models in terms of lvy flights and subdiffusion becomes more and more popular @xcite . in the complex systems the distinct class of subdiffusion processes",
    "was reported in condensed phases@xcite , ecology@xcite , and biology@xcite .",
    "superdiffusion driven by levy flights is actually observed in various real systems and is used to model a variety of processes such as bulk mediated surface diffusion @xcite , exciton and charge transport in polymers under conformational motion @xcite , transport in micelle systems or heterogeneous rocks @xcite , two - dimensional rotating flow @xcite , and many others@xcite .",
    "goychuk and coworkers @xcite studied the subdiffusive transport in tilted periodic potentials and established a universal scaling relation for diffusive transport .",
    "dybiec and coworkers @xcite studied the minimal setup for a lvy ratchet and found that due to the nonthermal character of the lvy noise , the net current can be obtained even in the absence of whatever additional time - dependent forces .",
    "del - castillo - negrete and coworkers @xcite also found the similar results in constant force - driven lvy ratchet .",
    "rosa and beims @xcite studied the optimal transport and its relation to superdiffusive transport and lvy walks for brownian particles in ratchet potential in the presence of modulated environment and external oscillating forces .",
    "we also studied the transport of brownian particles in the presence of ac - driving forces and lvy flights and multiple current reversals were observed@xcite    recently , much attention has been devoted to the competition between subdiffusion and lvy flights .",
    "the competition is conveniently described by the fractional fokker - planck equation with temporal and spatial fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to see this competition in the framework of the fractional fokker - planck dynamics .",
    "magdziarz and coworkers @xcite proposed a equivalent approach based on the subordinated langevin method to visualize the competition on the level of sample paths as well as on the level of probability density functions . based on this approach dybiec and coworkers",
    "@xcite found that due to the competition between lvy flights and subdiffusion , the standard measure used to discriminate between anomalous and normal behavior can not be applied straightforwardly .",
    "koren and coworkers@xcite have investigated the first passage times in one - dimensional system displaying a competition between subdiffusion and lvy flights and found some peculiar phenomena .",
    "what will happen when the particles move in a ratchet potential subjected to subdiffusion and lvy flights ? in order to answer this question we use the subordinated langevin method proposed by the magdziarz and coworkers @xcite to investigate this competition in a minimal lvy ratchet without any external driving forces .",
    "we emphasize on visualizing the competition on the level of the group velocity and diffusion and finding how this competition affects the directed transport .",
    "we consider the transport of the brownian particles driven by lvy flights and subdiffusion in the absence of whatever additional time - dependent forces .",
    "the competition between lvy flights and subdiffusion in a ratchet potential @xmath0 can be described by the fractional fokker - planck equation with temporal and spatial fractional derivatives @xcite @xmath1 p(x , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the probability density for particles at position @xmath3 and time @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath7 is the fractional of the riemann - liouville operator ( @xmath8 ) defined through @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gamma function . from the definition ,",
    "it becomes apparent that subdiffusion corresponds to a slowly decaying memory integral in the dynamical equation for @xmath2 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 , @xmath12 , stands for the riesz fractional derivative @xcite with the fourier transform @xmath13 .",
    "the occurrences of the operator @xmath7 and @xmath11 are induced by the heavy - tailed waiting times between successive jumps and the heavy - tailed distributions of the jumps , respectively , in the underlying continuous - time random walk scheme .",
    "the case of @xmath14 , @xmath15 corresponds to the standard fokker - planck equation .",
    "@xmath0 is an asymmetric periodic potential @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the amplitude and the asymmetric parameter of the potential , respectively .    because it is very difficult to solve eq .",
    "( 1 ) analytically and numerically , we used the subordinated langevin method proposed by magdziarz and coworkers @xcite to investigate the transport . in their method , the solution @xmath2 of eq .",

    "( 8) . from the above procedures ,",
    "one can obtain the subordinated process @xmath43 and its probability distribution function is equal to the solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for more detailed information on the algorithm",
    ", please see the ref .",
    "( 22 ) .    in the classical ratchets",
    ", one can use the average velocity and effective diffusion coefficient to describe the transport .",
    "however , for the noise with distribution of a lvy - stable law , the mean of the noise and the second moment may do not exist . as a consequence ,",
    "the classical stochastic theory ( average velocity and effective diffusion coefficient ) , which is based on the ordinary central limit theorem , is no longer valid . to overcome this problem , dybiec and coworkers @xcite recently proposed a different approach to the lvy ratchet problem based on the quantile line analysis for @xmath44 .",
    "quantile line is a very useful tool for investigation of the overall motion of the probability density of finding a particle in the vicinity of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "a median line for a stochastic process @xmath43 is a function of @xmath45 given by the relationship @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , one can use the derivative of the median to define the group velocity of the particle packet@xcite , @xmath47 and this definition is valid even for the case of lacking average velocity .",
    "in order to investigate the competition between lvy flights and subdiffusion in a ratchet potential , we carried out extensively numerical simulations based on the subordinated langevin method @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 throughout the work . in our simulations , we have considered more than @xmath50 realizations to obtain the accurate median . in order to provide the requested accuracy of the system the dynamics time step was chosen to be smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "we have checked that these are sufficient for the system to obtain consistent results .",
    "firstly , we will investigate the diffusive properties of the brownian particles .",
    "usually , the types of the diffusion processes are determined by the spread of the distance traveled by a random walker .",
    "the diffusion is characterized through the power law form of the mean - square displacement @xmath52 . according to the value of the index @xmath53 , one can distinguish subdiffusion ( @xmath54 ) , normal diffusion ( @xmath55 ) and superdiffusion ( @xmath56 ) . here",
    ", we use the median of square displacement @xmath57 , instead of mean - square displacement , to characterize the diffusion .",
    "1 ( a ) shows the time dependence of @xmath58 for different combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath33 without any external potential .",
    "it is found that the linear time dependence of the median of square displacement , @xmath59 , will occur for the case of @xmath60=1 , which indicates the normal diffusion . however , this is not true , for example @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the process is still non - markov and non - gaussian .",
    "this pseudo - normal diffusion is due to the competition between lvy flights and subdiffusion .",
    "dybiec and coworkers @xcite have presented discussions in detail on this paradoxical diffusion .",
    "1 ( b ) presents the time dependence of @xmath58 in the presence of a ratchet potential .",
    "interestingly , the pseudo - normal diffusion for @xmath61 and @xmath62 with external potentials is not normal .",
    "next , we will study the rectified mechanism of the lvy ratchets .",
    "usually , the ratchet mechanism demands three key ingredients @xcite which are ( a ) nonlinear periodic potential : it is necessary since the system will produce a zero mean output from zero - mean input in a linear system ; ( b)asymmetry of the potential , it can violate the symmetry of the response ; ( c)fluctuating : lvy flights can break thermodynamical equilibrium . in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , we studied the time dependence of the median for different values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath18 at @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the median is positive for @xmath65 , zero at @xmath66 , and negative for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry of the potential will determine the direction of the transport and no directed transport occurs in a symmetric potential .",
    "now we will give the physical interpretation of the directed transport for the case of @xmath68 .",
    "firstly , the particles stay in the minima of the potential awaiting large noise pulse to be catapulted out .",
    "the particles will be thrown out to the left and the right with the equal probabilities . in this case , the distance from minima to maxima is shorter from the right side than that from the left side . consequently , most of the particles are thrown out from the right side , resulting in positive transport .",
    "this gives rise to the overall preferred motion to the right .",
    "figure 2 ( b ) gives the time dependence of the median for different combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath33 .",
    "we find that lvy flights are necessary to obtain the directed transport . for gaussian case ( @xmath69 ) , directed transport disappears .",
    "this is due to the nonthermal character of the lvy flights that can break thermodynamical equilibrium . from fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) we can see that the asymmetry of the potential and the non - equilibrium character of the lvy flights are the two necessary conditions for directed transport .",
    "the direction of the transport is determined by the direction of the steeper slope of of the potential and the lvy flights can break thermaldynamical equilibrium .",
    "these two key ingredients can realize the ratchet effects .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the dependence of the group velocity @xmath70 on the subdiffusive index @xmath33 for different values of the lvy index @xmath23 .",
    "one can see that group velocity @xmath70 increases monotonically with the subdiffusive index @xmath33 . for small values of @xmath33 ,",
    "the waiting time between successive jumps is very long and it is not easy for particles to pass across the barrier .",
    "thus , most particles will stay in their original minima of the potential and the group velocity becomes very small .",
    "especially , we also find that there exists a threshold value of @xmath33 below which no directed transport can be obtained .",
    "the subdiffusion dominates the transport for small values of @xmath33 ( @xmath71 ) , while the effects of the lvy flights become preponderant for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "figure 4 shows the dependence of the group velocity @xmath70 on the lvy index @xmath23 for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath72 , the system is under thermodynamical equilibrium and no directed transport appears . for small values of @xmath23 , lvy flights are longer and the outliers in the lvy noise are larger . in this case , the effects of the asymmetry of the potential become very small , resulting in small group velocity . therefore , there exists a optimal value of @xmath23 at which the group velocity takes its maxima .",
    "this can also be confirmed by fig .",
    "3 . for very small values of @xmath33 , for example @xmath73 ,",
    "the group velocity is zero for all values of @xmath23 and the transport is absolutely dominated by subdiffusion .",
    "the group velocity @xmath70 as a function of noise intensity @xmath5 is shown in fig . 5 for different combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath33 .",
    "the curve is observed to be bell shaped which shows the feature of resonance .",
    "when @xmath74 , the particles can not pass across the barrier and there is no directed current .",
    "when @xmath75 so that the noise is very large , the effect of the potential disappears and the group velocity tends to zero , also .",
    "there is an optimal value of @xmath5 at which the group velocity is maximal .",
    "there are two intersections ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) between the line of @xmath78 and @xmath64 and the line of @xmath63 and @xmath62 . for simplicity , we define @xmath79 as the group velocity for different values of @xmath23 and @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath80 , @xmath81 , lvy flights dominates the transport . when @xmath82 , @xmath83 , the transport is governed by subdiffusion .",
    "for the case of @xmath84 , all particles can easily pass across the barrier and lvy flights will mainly contribute to the transport and @xmath81    in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the dependence of the group velocity @xmath70 on the amplitude @xmath17 of the potential for different combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath85 , the effects of the potential disappear and the group velocity tends to zero .",
    "when @xmath86 , the particles can not pass across the barrier and the group velocity goes to zero , also .",
    "thus , the curve shows a peak .",
    "remarkably , there is an intersection between the line of @xmath63 and @xmath62 and the line of @xmath78 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is due to the competition between lvy flights and subdiffusion .",
    "when @xmath87 , lvy flights are predominant and @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath89 , subdiffusion dominates the transport and @xmath90 . in this case , the height of the barrier is very high and few particles driven by lvy flights can pass across the barrier , the effects of the lvy flights will disappear and subdiffusion will play a major role .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the directed transport of the brownian particles in a ratchet potential driven by lvy flights coexisting with subdiffusion .",
    "we used recently developed framework of monte carlo simulation @xcite which is equal to the solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation . the group velocity proposed by dybiec and coworkers @xcite",
    "is used to measure the transport .",
    "it is found that the group velocity increases monotonically with the subdiffusive index , while the group velocity as a function of the lvy index is nonmonotonic .",
    "the former is caused by the increase of the waiting time between successive jumps and the latter is owing to the interplay between lvy flights and the height of the barriers .",
    "there is a threshold value of @xmath33 below which the transport is absolutely dominated by subdiffusion and the directed transport disappears .",
    "the dependences of the group velocity on the noise intensity and the amplitude of the potential are also investigated .",
    "there is an optimal value of the noise intensity ( the amplitude of the potential ) at which the group velocity is maximal .",
    "the competition between levy fights and subdiffusion in the ratchet potential is observed on the level of the group velocity as well as the median of square displacement .",
    "the nonthermal character of the lvy flights and the asymmetry of the potential are the necessary conditions for directed transport when the system is in the absence of any external driving forces . because of this competition",
    ", we also found the pseudo - normal diffusion reported by dybiec and coworkers @xcite , in which time dependence of the median of square displacement is linear , @xmath59 , while the process is still non - markov and non - gaussian .",
    "anomalous transport is becoming widely recognized in a variety of the fields . beyond its intrinsic theoretical interest , the results we have presented may have wide applications in some complex systems , such as diffusive transport in plasmas , particles separation with non - gaussian diffusion , and ratchet transport in biology systems that are intrinsically out of equilibrium .",
