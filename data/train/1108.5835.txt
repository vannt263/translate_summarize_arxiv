    "in cavity optomechanical systems  @xcite , the cooling of a mechanical resonator is important to study the mechanical effects of light in the quantum domain  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the reduction of thermal noise generally is a requirement to implement various applications in quantum information relying on optomechanical couplings  @xcite . with the recent progress of cooling in cavity optomechanical systems  @xcite , it is becoming possible to access quantum ground states .",
    "the cooling techniques , such as the resolved sideband cooling  @xcite , generally make use of a continuous light field that drives a mechanical resonator into a steady state of lower temperature .",
    "recently , several authors have begun to explore the possibilities of cooling and manipulating the states of mirrors with optical pulses  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the fact that chirped pulses can lead to an efficient population transfer in two - level systems  @xcite , we examine how a chirped - pulse interaction can transfer thermal fluctuations from the mirror to the cavity field . as we shall discuss below , the correspondence between a two - level system and optomechanical systems [ defined in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian_s ] ) ] can be established via the heisenberg equations of motion of the linearized system under a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "therefore , analytical solutions known in two - level systems driven by chirped pulses can be applied here  @xcite .",
    "owing to the frequency modulation in chirped pulses , population transfer can be made without the need for a high - precision control of detuning and pulse areas .    in this paper , we will first provide a formulation of the linearized quantum system driven by a general pulse .",
    "then we will indicate how the mirror - field coupling can be shaped into a chirped form by using a proper time - dependence of an external driving field .",
    "specifically , we will study a class of chirped pulses proposed by allen and eberly for two - level systems  @xcite .",
    "such a class of chirped pulses has analytic solutions for nondissipative systems , and depending on the chirped parameters , they describe both adiabatic and nonadiabatic transitions . using numerical calculations , we include counter - rotating terms and dissipation effects , and we demonstrate that cooling can be achieved with the chirped - pulse coupling . in the case where the mechanical damping rate of the mirror is sufficiently small",
    ", the cooling performance is mainly limited by the cavity - field decay rate .",
    "our model consists of a fabry - perot cavity formed by a fixed end mirror and a moving end mirror connected with a spring ( fig .",

    "thus , @xmath86 is a relation to implement efficient cooling of the mirror in the absence of dissipation .",
    "it is useful to note that for the constant - pulse coupling case [ i.e. , @xmath36 is a constant ] , one can also extract energy from the mirror , but the corresponding solution is oscillatory at a rabi frequency , i.e. , the phonon number in the mirror is a cosine function of time . in this case",
    "the timing of the constant pulse is crucial in order to locate the instant when the phonon number is minimum .",
    "however , our scheme does not have such a timing control issue because the solution  ( [ phononnum ] ) indicates that after the pulse duration ( about @xmath107 ) , the residual quasiphonon number of the mirror changes slowly in time by the behavior of the @xmath108 $ ] function .    as a remark",
    ", we indicate that @xmath87 should be much smaller than the mirror frequency @xmath3 in order to meet the condition of rwa",
    ". the violation of rwa would mean that the parametric interaction of the form @xmath109 becomes important , which generally leads to heating of the system . therefore by eq .",

    "in addition , the counter - rotating terms @xmath114 ignored in rwa may modify the dynamic process . in",
    "what follows , we numerically study the cooling process in the dissipative case beyond rwa .",
    "we consider the realistically experimental parameters for the system  @xcite : @xmath115  mhz , @xmath116  khz , @xmath117  mhz , and @xmath118  hz .",
    "namely , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 . with these parameters and the chirped pulse given in fig .",
    "[ chirpedpulsefig ] , we solve eq .",
    "( [ expreofr ] ) numerically . in fig .",
    "[ phononphotonf](a ) , we plot the time evolution of the mean displaced particle numbers . we see that the @xmath122 decreases rapidly from its initial value ( @xmath123 ) to a relatively small number ( about @xmath124 ) when the chirped pulse is applied . at the same time",
    ", @xmath111 in the cavity increases rapidly from zero to a peak value and then decreases to zero gradually through the cavity decay channel .",
    "we note that the residual fluctuations of the mirror are limited by the noise of the system , mainly of the cavity - field damping .",
    "our numerical investigations show that when the cavity - field decay rate is @xmath125 , the residual @xmath126 can further be reduced to @xmath127 [ the dash line in fig .",
    "[ phononphotonf](a ) ] .",
    "in addition , numerical calculations indicate the correction from the counter - rotating terms is negligible with these parameters .",
    "we remark that during the pulse interaction , the mirror attains a non - zero coherent amplitude ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) according to eq .",
    "( [ av - b ] ) .",
    "but such a coherent motion should not be confused with the fluctuations we aim to reduce in this paper .",
    "for the present parameters used in fig .",
    "[ phononphotonf](a ) , we plot the time evolution of @xmath129 in fig .",
    "[ phononphotonf](b ) .",
    "we see that there is a small amplitude @xmath130 near the end of the pulse interaction .",
    "actually , when the thermal fluctuation of the mirror is completely transferred to the cavity , the mirror in the displaced representation will be in its ground state .",
    "therefore , in the original representation , the mirror is prepared in a coherent state of the mechanical motion .",
    "we also point out that although there are residual cavity photons after the pulse duration ( around @xmath131 ) , the heating due to such photons is found to be negligible because of the weak coupling strength @xmath10 .",
    "we can estimate that for a residual cavity photon number @xmath132 at time @xmath131 , the mirror can be excited to have phonon number @xmath133 , which is of the order of @xmath134 with the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ phononphotonf ] @xmath135 .",
    "therefore the heating is mainly due to the heat bath of the mirror .",
    "for example , we find that the heat bath of the mirror would increase the phonon number from @xmath124 to @xmath136 when the time evolves from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "the frequency modulation characterized by the parameter @xmath78 is a main feature of the chirped coupling . in the case of @xmath139",
    ", the coupling corresponds to a @xmath140 pulse because @xmath141dt=\\pi$ ] is the pulse area .",
    "however , such a simple @xmath140 pulse generally does not bring an optimal cooling when dissipation and counter - rotating terms are included .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 therefore provides a way to adjust the pulse for a better cooling performance . in fig .",
    "[ betaeffect ] , we demonstrate this feature numerically by plotting the final mean displaced phonon number of the mirror ( defined at time @xmath142 ) as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "there are two situations [ fig .",
    "[ betaeffect](a ) and [ betaeffect](b ) ] that we will discuss below , but in both figures , it is apparent that non - zero values of @xmath78 can better reduce the displaced phonon number of the mirror .",
    "we point out that the final displaced phonon number can become less sensitive to the detuning @xmath143 when @xmath144 is increased .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ betaeffect](a ) where we can compare the sideband resonance case @xmath145 with a slightly off resonance case .",
    "we see that although cooling with an off - resonance @xmath143 is less effective , the dependence on @xmath143 becomes weaker as @xmath144 increases . for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ betaeffect](a ) , the final displaced phonon numbers are essentially the same when @xmath146 .",
    "this shares a similar feature in two - level systems as a chirped pulse can make efficient population transfer in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "vs the phase modulation amplitude @xmath78 for various detunings @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "( b ) plot of @xmath149 vs @xmath78 for various parameters @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152.,width=3 ]    in fig .",
    "[ betaeffect](b ) , we illustrate the effect of @xmath78 on cooling when there are uncertainties in controlling the pulse area .",
    "such an error , for example , may come from an inaccurate value of the coupling strength @xmath10 .",
    "let us express @xmath36 as @xmath153,\\ ] ] with @xmath154 describing the deviation . at @xmath139 , fig .",
    "[ betaeffect](b ) shows that a modest change of @xmath154 can affect the final displaced phonon number quite significantly .",
    "in fact , we notice that the case @xmath155 in the figure actually corresponds to a better cooling .",
    "this indicates that @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ optirelation ] ) is no longer optimal for cooling because of dissipative effects .",
    "the search for optimal pulse parameters relies on numerical work , but fig .",
    "[ betaeffect](b ) suggests that the frequency modulation with a suitable range of @xmath78 may ease the sensitivity of @xmath154 and hence improve the cooling performance even though the pulse parameters are not exactly optimal .",
    "to conclude , we have proposed a method to cool a moving mirror in cavity optomechanics by a chirped pulse . within the linearization framework ,",
    "we have shown how a chirped pulse coupling can be achieved by an external driving field , and numerically we have demonstrated that thermal fluctuations in the mirror can be significantly transferred to the cavity after the pulse . in particular , the frequency modulation plays a positive role in the cooling process especially when there are uncertainties in controlling the detuning and pulse areas .",
    "finally , we remark that it would be difficult to present a general comparison of the cooling efficiency between our scheme and the resolved sideband cooling . this is because eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) has no analytic solution and so the residual phonon number can only be calculated numerically .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that by decreasing the cavity decay rate , the residual phonon number can be lowered . as a specific example , with @xmath156 and the same other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ phononphotonf ] , the residual phonon number can reach @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , the system under such parameters may effectively be considered as the ground state , although this residual phonon number is higher than the resolved sideband cooling limit @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative method of cooling based on pulsed interaction , which is a transient solution rather than a steady - state one .",
    "in other words , the process can occur in a finite duration of time , and this could be a useful feature for manipulating quantum states of the mirror .",

    "<S> we investigate the response of a harmonically confined mirror to an optical pulse in cavity optomechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the pulsed coupling strength takes the form of a chirped pulse , thermal fluctuations of the mirror can be significantly transferred to the cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the frequency modulation of the pulse could enable a better cooling performance by suppressing the sensitivity of the dependence of detuning and pulse areas . </S>",
    "<S> using numerical investigations , we find that the pulsed - cooling is mainly limited by the cavity - field decay rate . </S>"
