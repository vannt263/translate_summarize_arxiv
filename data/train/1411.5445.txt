    "the problem of dark energy and dark matter is one of the main challenges in modern cosmology .",
    "astrophysical data indicates that the observed universe is in an accelerated phase .",
    "this acceleration could be caused by this so - called dark energy ( see refs .   for a recent review ) .",
    "these discoveries have set new serious challenges for theoretical physics and have prompted speculation , mostly based on phenomenological ideas which involve new dynamical sources of gravity that act as dark energy , and/or various modifications to general relativity . the spectrum of models , having been postulated and explored in recent years ,",
    "is extremely wide and includes , in particular , quintessence , k - essence , ghost condensates , dvali - gabadadze - porrati gravity , galileon gravity , and @xmath0 gravity refs .",
    "( see refs .   for detailed reviews of these and other models ) .",
    "such cosmological models tend to describe not only the accelerated expansion at this stage of evolution , but also at all other stages of evolution .",
    "all these models are divided into two main classes : @xmath0 theory and alike ( see refs .  ) , and models which use various objects : scalars , spinor , cosmological constant , liquid with the difficult state equation .",
    "the spinor fields have been used as a source of a gravitational field in a number of works , and the interaction of the spinor and scalar fields as a factor of inflation expansion has been considered .",
    "friedman - robertson - walker s ( frw ) approach to the real space - time is considered to be the closest , at the same time the estimated change of a metrics conformal factor for the analysis of behavior of the universe in cosmological models is considered the most often . in this work",
    "we will study cosmological models similar to those offered in the works refs .  , but with non - minimally interacted scalar field .",
    "most of the phenomenological models represent various modifications of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "the models allowing non - minimal interaction of scalar field derivatives and curvature are of particular interest .",
    "as amendola showed , the theory of such kind , can not be brought to a form of einstein gravitation by conformal transformation .",
    "note that usually field equations in models with non - minimal derivative interaction are the differential equations above the second order .",
    "however , the order goes down to the second in a special case when the kinetic term is connected only to einstein s tensor , i.e. @xmath1 ( see , for example ref .  ) . in works refs .",
    "authors have studied cosmological scenarios from non - minimal interaction of the derivative @xmath2 , concentrating on models with zero and constant potential . according to the parameter choices",
    ", we have obtained a variety of behaviors including the big bang , an expanding universe without a beginning , a cosmological turnaround , an eternally contracting universe , a big crunch , and a cosmological bounce . in this cosmological model the non - minimal interaction of gravitation and a matter ( a scalar field ) is considered in a combination with the spinor field . in introduction",
    "the relevance of the considered model is studied . in section 2",
    "the task is formulated and the main equations are given . in section 3 we will obtain the frw equations . in section 4",
    "we will calculate solutions and conduct asymptotic research solutions . in section 5",

    ".    a symmetric form of the scalar field energy - momentum tensor can be obtained from in the form @xmath23 we now write the equation of motion of the scalar field as : @xmath24",
    "we will choose the potential of a fermionny field @xmath25 in the following form : @xmath26 einstein s equations in frw will be as follows : @xmath27 @xmath28 the equation of motion of the scalar field : @xmath29 we will make replacements to simplify these equations : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 it is possible to choose two equivalent systems of the independent equations : and ; and , which will result in only one equation .",
    "we will consider the system of the equations , , we will receive the equation on @xmath33 : @xmath34 we will notice that for @xmath35 the equation is similar to the equation formulated in work ref .  .",
    "in the case of a lack of potential of a scalar field the equation shapes into a simple form : @xmath36 @xmath37 thus the independent system of the field equations in lack of potential of a scalar field includes the equation and the equation .",
