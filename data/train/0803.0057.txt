    "since the pioneering work of markowitz in 1950s  @xcite , the financial cross - correlations are constantly a subject of extensive studies both at the theoretical and practical levels due to their fundamental relation to risk management and portfolio investing . in the field of econophysics ,",
    "an interest in this type of correlations arose after it had been shown that they can be described  @xcite in the framework of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite , expressing both a kind of universality and significant deviations from it .",
    "stock market cross - correlations are typically quantified in terms of a correlation matrix , created for a set of @xmath0 time series representing returns of different stocks . from this point of view",
    ", evolution of a stock market can be decomposed into @xmath0 independent modes associated with eigenvalues of the correlation matrix .",
    "it occurs that a vast majority of these eigenvalues are concordant with the eigenvalue distribution of the relevant random matrix ensemble ( the wishart ensemble )  @xcite , what according to a common belief suggests that these rmt modes do not carry any market - specific information beyond being a pure noise .",
    "validity of this belief , however , has recently been challenged in some works  @xcite .",
    "as regards the remaining minority of the eigenvalues which deviate from the rmt predictions , there is a general agreement that they express the actual non - random linear dependencies between the price fluctuations of different assets .",
    "their particular number depends on a market and the number of analyzed stocks , but in each case there is an eigenvalue that strongly dominates , developing an `` energy gap '' that separates it from the subsequent eigenvalues .",
    "this peculiar eigenvalue is associated with a strongly delocalized eigenvector and is related to a `` market mode '' , i.e. a collective evolution of large group of stocks that usually closely mimics evolution of the market s global index . from this perspective , magnitude of the largest eigenvalue reflects how collective is the evolution of an analyzed market .",
    "if , apart from the largest eigenvalue , there are also other eigenvalues which do not agree with the rmt spectrum , they correspond to smaller groups of interrelated stocks that can be usually identified with market sectors  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the number of the non - random eigenvalues is highest for the largest , mature markets like new york , london , frankfurt etc . , while the less capitalized markets , e.g. the emerging ones , develop the spectrum which consists of a strongly repelled eigenvalue and the bulk with only minor disagreements in respect to the rmt prediction  @xcite .",
    "in fact , on small markets sectors and individual companies are too weak to be considered an optimal reference for the investors . instead , the investors trade according to the behaviour of the whole market or even they blindly follow the moves of the world s largest markets .    here",
    "we analyze high - frequency data from the warsaw stock exchange and inspect the correlation matrix eigenspectra calculated for a few selected groups of stocks .",
    "we address the question whether the correlation properties of the warsaw stock market still situate it among the emerging markets or , conversely , it has already matured enough to be considered a developed market . an inspiration for rising",
    "this question is the fact that the wse evolution shares some properties ( like the broad multifractal spectra and the returns distributions which can be fitted by the @xmath1-gaussians ) with the well - established markets , as our earlier studies showed  @xcite .",
    "our tick - by - tick data covered the period from 17 november 2000 to 30 june 2005 and consisted of 39 stocks that were , at least temporarily , included during this period in wig20 index .",
    "wig20 is a capitalization - weighted index comprising the 20 largest companies traded on wse .",
    "its composition changes from time to time in order to reflect the current capitalization ranking of the wse stocks . during the forementioned time interval",
    "only 10 stocks were constantly included in wig20 , while each of the remaining 29 stocks was contributing to wig20 for a shorter period due to falling in the capitalization ranking or being delisted from wse .",
    "although it is associated with a relatively small number of companies , wig20 is considered the most important and influential index on wse .",
    "this is because the companies included in wig20 are viewed as belonging to a core of polish economy .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable to expect that their statistical and correlation properties differ , at least to some extent , from the properties of other companies that are not a part of this index .",
    "also a particular stock may change its behaviour after being included in or removed from wig20 . in order to investigate this issue we divided our set of signals into 4 partially overlapping groups ( see figure 1 ) :    \\(1 ) group 1 of @xmath2 signals associated with the stocks listed on wse over the entire period .",
    "\\(2 ) group 2 of @xmath3 signals constituting wig20 with changing stock content according to the actual wig20 basket composition ; signals ( at the level of normalized returns ) representing the replaced stocks were cut and joined with the ones representing the replacing stocks .",
    "\\(3 ) group 3 of @xmath4 signals for the stocks that were permanently inluded in wig20 ; these are also the companies with the largest capitalization .",
    "\\(4 ) group 4 of @xmath5 signals representing the stocks with the least capitalization among the ones that were temporarily included in wig20 .",
    "we performed our calculations for each of the above groups independently .",
    "for each individual company @xmath6 , from the raw tick - by - tick data we extracted a time series of price evolution @xmath7 sampled with 1 min frequency and calculated the corresponding returns according to the usual definition : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the time lag . after normalizing the time series of returns to have unit variance and zero mean , the resulting length of each signal was equal to @xmath10 .    from @xmath11 time series",
    "we construct an @xmath12 data matrix @xmath13 and the correlation matrix @xmath14 that are related by @xmath15 by diagonalizing the correlation matrix @xmath16 one obtains a set of its eigenvalues @xmath17 and eigenvectors @xmath18 .",
    "an ensemble of random matrices which can be used as a null hypothesis in our context is the enseble of wishart matrices .",
    "it offers an analytic expression for a distribution of eigenvalues , known as the marchenko - pastur formula  @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in its upper @xmath19 and lower @xmath20 bounds only : @xmath21 with @xmath22 and time series variance @xmath23 .",
    "figure 2 shows the eigenvalue spectra for each of the 4 considered groups of stocks ; two time lags are used : @xmath24 min ( top ) and @xmath25 min , i.e. 1 trading day ( bottom ) . in accordance with the remarks done in the introductory section , for all the groups and for both time lags the largest eigenvalue @xmath26 is repelled from the rmt range defined by eq .",
    "( [ bounds ] ) . clearly , for groups 1,2,3 the corresponding shift is stronger than for group 4 .",
    "as regards the rest of the eigenvalues , they are close to the random matrix region ; the observed discrepancies between their position and the rmt bounds can be attributed to the `` squeezing '' effect of large @xmath26 exerted on the smaller eigenvalues  @xcite which are shifted towards zero . the larger magnitude of @xmath26 , the stronger is this effect .",
    "agreement between the empirical eigenspectrum and the rmt prediction can be significantly improved by removing a mode associated with @xmath26 from the analyzed signals ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the largest eigenvalue is related to the temporal evolution of the market mode . as we see in figure 2 ,",
    "practically no other eigenvalue considerably exceeds the rmt upper bound @xmath27 , what indicates that - besides the idiosyncratic fluctuations - the market mode is the principal and unique factor responsible for the behaviour of individual stocks .",
    "a lack of other deviating eigenvalues is the evidence of weakness of a sectorization in the wse market .",
    "the magnitudes of the largest eigenvalues for different groups of stocks can not be directly compared based on figure 2 .",
    "this is because of a lack of a proper normalization : the correlation matrices for different groups have different size and different trace .",
    "thus , in each case we divide @xmath26 by the matrix trace . as a result",
    "we obtain normalized values of @xmath26 expressing a fraction of the maximum possible magnitude ( equal to the matrix trace ) that is absorbed by the largest eigenvalue .",
    "it thus describes the `` rigidity '' of a given group s temporal evolution .",
    "the corresponding results are exhibited in figure 3 . for both time scales , the largest normalized magnitude of @xmath26",
    "is observed for group 3 , comprising the largest companies permanently listed in wig20 .",
    "the difference between this and other groups is especially substantial for the larger time scale of 1 trading day ( figure 3 , bottom panel ) .",
    "this indicates that the stocks for the largest companies are particularly strongly coupled with each other",
    ". evidently smaller strength of collective movements can be seen for group 2 ( representing the actual content of wig20 ) , which is associated with the second - largest magnitude of @xmath26 .",
    "the stocks within the remaining groups 3 and 4 are relatively weakly correlated .",
    "in contrast to groups 1 and 2 , which at each moment comprise the stocks belonging to the wig20 basket , the stocks from groups 3 and 4 are not necessarilly included in wig20 during the whole studied interval of time : at each particular moment some of them belong to wig20 and some of them do not .",
    "this also means that their capitalization is , on average , smaller than the one for the stocks from groups 1 and 2 .    by comparing the results in both panels of figure 3 ,",
    "one can notice that for the longer time scale the eigenvalues assume larger magnitudes than do their counterparts for the shorter time scale .",
    "this can be a manifestation of the epps effect  @xcite , i.e. increase of market cross - correlations with increasing time scale of the returns . in order to verify this supposition , we systematically inspected the functional dependence of @xmath26 on time lag @xmath9 for a few distinct time scales 10 min @xmath28 900 min .",
    "indeed , the results collected in figure 4 confirm that the observed behaviour of the largest eigenvalue is a consequence of the epps effect .",
    "for all the groups , @xmath26 increases from small values for the shortest time lags to the group - specific saturation levels for @xmath29 min ( compare with the american market with similar saturation occurring for @xmath30 min ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that for group 3 and group 4 and for @xmath31 min the largest eigenvalue is comparable in size with the noise level ( @xmath32 ) predicted by rmt .",
    "this outcome resembles the analogous one obtained for the american stock market  @xcite : the smaller is the capitalization of a group of stocks , the less internally correlated and more noisy is the group s evolution , what - in consequence with the epps effect - leads to a complete lack of actual inter - stock couplings for sufficiently short time scales .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the fact that investors need some time to fully react to new information and events on a stock market .",
    "stocks of smaller companies are traded less frequently than stocks of large companies and therefore the amount of time needed to develop couplings between such stocks is considerably larger",
    ".    12.5 cm",
    "we investigated the inter - stock correlations for the relatively large companies traded on warsaw stock exchange and included in the wig20 index .",
    "we divided the full set of stocks into 4 groups depending on a particular stock s capitalization and a time interval in which the stock was included in wig20 .",
    "our results show that the polish stock market can basically be expressed by an one - factor model with the fully developed couplings to occur at time scales longer than half a trading day .",
    "since these properties are characteristic for small and emerging markets and since , on the other hand , the polish market reveals some features that are common to well - developed markets ( @xmath1-gaussian structure of the returns p.d.f.s",
    "@xcite , multifractality  @xcite ) , we arrive at the conclusion that at present wse is in a transition phase from being an emerging market to becoming a fully - established one .",
    "our analysis also proved that the strength of correlations among stocks crucially depends on their capitalization - this effect is universal for all the markets investigated so far in literature ."
