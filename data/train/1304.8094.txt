    "quantum systems in reduced dimensions have attracted extensive interest dating back at least to the 1950s . since then , striking predictions have been made for the behavior of quantum gases in reduced dimensions . in both many - body @xcite and few - body physics@xcite , predictions exist that quantum states in reduced dimensional systems will show qualitatively different behavior from isotropic 3d systems , both in the zero - temperature limit and in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "many of these conclusions can be connected to theoretical explorations from the mathematics community into the nature of scattering in a space of arbitrary dimensions @xcite , dating even farther back in time . however , for a long time , the creation and observation of reduced dimensional systems were hampered by limits on existing experimental techniques .",
    "later , after laser cooling and trapping techniques were developed for ultracold atomic gases @xcite , many experimental quasi-1d and quasi-2d @xcite quantum systems were realized and a number of theoretically - predicted novel behaviors were observed . in quasi-1d",
    "fermionic @xmath0k @xcite and bosonic @xmath1rb @xcite , various properties from pure-1d theory have been confirmed . by tuning the ratio(s ) of trapping frequencies in different directions ( @xmath2 _ e.g. _ ) , the shape of an ultracold gas can be engineered and varied continuously from a nearly isotropic 3d geometry to a quasi-1d or quasi-2d geometry .",
    "cross - dimensional effects have been observed @xcite and also theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "these phenomena in low - dimensional systems have recently been reviewed by @xcite .    after achieving success in creating reduced - dimensional systems",
    ", physicists began to explore the scattering properties of atoms , hoping to find additional tunability of interactions in ultracold gases .",
    "the confinement - induced resonance(cir ) is one such useful tunability of particular interest . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the cir adds another way to manipulate and control low - dimensional systems .",
    "dunjko _ et.al _",
    "@xcite has reviewed developments related to cir for a variety of systems .",
    "the cir is unique in the sense that the system exhibits the unitarity limit at a non - resonant value of the 3d scattering parameters ( _ i.e. _ the scattering length for _ s_-wave , and the scattering volume for _ p_-wave ) .",
    "the cir in a harmonically transverse - confined quasi-1d system was predicted theoretically by olshanii @xcite , and later extended to fermions by granger and blume @xcite . in realistic atomic interactions , the incoming wave in the z - direction will not only couple to the _ s_-wave ( or _ p_-wave for fermions ) component of the interaction , but also to higher partial waves components .",
    "higher partial wave contributions to the cir become increasingly important as the scattering energy increases . to address this point , giannakeas",
    "@xcite recently developed a method involving all partial waves , and pointed out a correction to the position of the cir that derives from the _ d_-wave component .    in the treatment of @xmath3-wave scattering ,",
    "olshanii @xcite derived the exact wave function and phase shift for a regularized zero range potential that are associated with low energy _",
    "s_-wave scattering .",
    "this problem can also be treated using green s function methods .",
    "implementation of an eigenfunction expansion of the green s function for treating a bound state induced by a s - wave zero - range potential was discussed in @xcite .",
    "a similar eigenfunction expansion of green s functions is embedded in olshanii s original work , although not explicitly emphasized .",
    "later , a systematic discussion of the green s function method and the corresponding lippman - schwinger equation was presented in @xcite .",
    "recently the green s function method was applied to treat @xmath3-wave zero - range interaction in asymmetric transverse harmonic confinement @xcite .",
    "however for higher partial waves , different mathematical models of the zero - range interaction are needed in the olshanii treatment @xcite . in an alternative treatment , granger and",
    "blume @xcite used the frame transformation method , in which the 3d phase shift information directly determines the 1d reaction matrix @xmath4 .",
    "thus the frame transformation approach avoids the need to design a zero - range model potential for higher partial wave scattering , which has some conceptual advantages .",
    "for example , a @xmath5-wave cir was predicted , and later observed experimentally @xcite .    as the exeperimental techniques of laser trapping have grown in sophistication , various confinement potentials beyond the harmonic trap",
    "have been realized , _",
    "e.g. _ optical lattice traps @xcite , uniform trap @xcite . in these systems , a more general theory of cir positions beyond a harmonic trap is needed .",
    "al _ gave a general description of a symmetric cylindrical hard wall trap @xcite using a greens function method .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop a systematic description of quasi-1d scattering in arbitrary transverse confinement .",
    "specifically , we consider the situation in which one light particle is scattered off an infinitely massive particle in the center of the confinement .",
    "we apply the local frame transformation method @xcite , and solve the divergence problem occurring in this method . because this divergence also arises in many other ananlytical and numerical applications of this method ,",
    "we believe that the systematic discussion presented here yields valuable insights .",
    "to illustrate our implementation of the method , we treat the cir in a square well transversely - confined system as an example .",
    "the development of our regularization method is inspired by the s - wave regularized delta function in 3d , and it can be generalized to higher partial waves interacting through short - range potentials .",
    "a physical system can often be divided into different regions , where the controlling physics varies . in each region , because of the difference in the symmetry of the interactions or the boundary conditions , the good quantum numbers can differ from one region to another . specifically , the quasi-1d system can be divided into two region : @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the characteristic length @xmath8 in the transverse confinement is the relevant length scale to divide this system ( it is the oscillator length in the case of harmonic confinement , and the box side length for the square well confinement ) , @xmath9 is the distance from the scattering center to the light particle , @xmath10 is the distance in z - direction , which is the only asymptotic outgoing direction . at large distance ( @xmath11 ) in any particular open channel ( @xmath12 defines the term  open channel \" with respect to its channel energy @xmath13 , in which @xmath14 ) , the outgoing wave vector @xmath15 is an asymptotically good quantum number . thus the phase shift for each @xmath15 asymptotically approaches to a constant .",
    "however , at very short range near the center of the confinement , where a scattering event occurs , the interaction potential has the full 3d spherical symmetry . in order to connect the short range scattering event and the large distance observables",
    ", we need to project the scattering information near the spherically symmetric scattering center onto the transverse channels to yield quasi-1d scattering information in the z - direction .",
    "the determination of this projection is the main goal of the local frame transformation method .",
    "local \" in this context was originally coined by fano @xcite to distinguish this method from the usual unitary class of frame transformations in @xcite .",
    "later , this method was extended and applied to several scattering problems @xcite , and in many cases it has resulted in excellent agreement with experimental observations and higher efficiency than previous theories .",
    "note that whereas zhao _ et al . _ @xcite claim to have identified a flaw in the fano technique for transformation of the solution that is irregular at the origin , the present application is tested numerically in sec.iii below and it exhibits no sign of any such difficulty .",
    "this section is organized as follows , first the of cir is described for general 2d confinement ; then some comparisons are made with the well - studied cir in 2d iostropic harmonic confinement ; next our method is applied to a transverse square cross section confinement with hard walls , which is one of the simplist geometries for 2d confinement without azimuthal symmetry .      in this paper",
    ", we specifically address the problem of one light particle ( mass @xmath16 ) that scatters from an infinitely massive particle located at the trap center .",
    "this is a system that could be realized experimentally , though apparently it has not yet been demonstrated . for this system",
    "it is not necessary to condier any coupling between the relative and center of amss coordinates of the colliding pair of particles .",
    "the hamiltonian for the light particle considered in this problem is , @xmath17 the frame transformation method can be applied to this problem , because the hamiltonian has two clear limits : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "this model hamiltonian is exact for the problem of one light particle that scatters from an infinitely massive particle located at the trap center . when it comes to treating two interacting particles with short range interaction , having both finite massesthis treatment",
    "might still be a reasonable approximation , or at least a first step in a more general theory that also accounts for nonseparability of the relative and center - of - mass ( com ) degrees of freedom .",
    "some discussion of the non - separability of com and relative motion are presented by sala _ et .",
    "@xcite in the context of optical lattices , for which the anharmonicity is weak .",
    "the eigenfunctions at short distance @xmath23 can be represented as linear combinations of non - interacting channel functions : @xmath24 where the reaction matrix @xmath25 encapsulates all the information about the short - range scattering caused by the potential , @xmath26 is the orbital angular momentum quantum number , _ m _ is the orbital magnetic quantum number . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energy - normalized regular and irregular solutions in spherical coordinates for a given scattering energy @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energy - normalized spherical bessel functions , @xmath31 is regular at @xmath33 , @xmath32 is irregular at @xmath33 , and they oscillate as @xmath34 with a @xmath35 difference in phase .",
    "the @xmath10-parity quantum number of the solutions is @xmath36 , which is important to keep in mind , since later the 3d solutions will be projected onto outgoing waves in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "the 2d isotropic harmonic confinement is a special case , in which the @xmath37 quantum number is conserved in both the spherical and cylindrical symmetries , so there is no need to explicitly specify @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , for a 2d transverse trap in general , all @xmath38 and @xmath39values could be coupled . in the unitary limit , of course , with short - range interactions ,",
    "the lowest one or two partial waves for each symmetry are expected to dominate the scattering observables .",
    "the regular @xmath40 and irregular @xmath41 eigenfunctions at large distances @xmath42 are : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are quantum numbers in the transverse plane .",
    "for example , in the square well cross section case , the eigenstates in the transverse plane for the even parity , of immediate interest here , are @xmath46 .",
    "the confinement in the @xmath47 plane forces the scattered waves to be asymptotically directed along either the positive or negative @xmath10-axis .    the evolution of the spherical wave function near the scattering center ( @xmath48 ) into an asymptotic wave function at @xmath7 on the a fixed energy shell @xmath29 can be accomplished by projecting the eigenfunctions near the scattering center onto the eigenfunctions relevant in the asymptotic region : @xmath49 @xmath50 is the transformation matrix between the two sets of eigenstates , and the @xmath50 matrix is energy dependent , since the expansion is performed on the energy shell .",
    "the summation includes only solutions of the same @xmath10-parity .",
    "two examples of @xmath50 are shown in appendix .    as was shown in previous papers @xcite ,",
    "the local frame transformation is non - unitary .",
    "this is because the two sets of eigenstates solve two different partial differential equations ( actually , in the present case , they solve the pde with the same hamiltonian but different boundary conditions ) , which are only approximately equal to each other in the region @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "subsequently a number of studies @xcite have discussed the resulting transformation of the reaction matrix @xmath4 , namely : @xmath52 .",
    "the physical @xmath53 matrix is deduced from closed - channel elimination @xcite , which enforces exponential decay in all energetically closed channels at @xmath54 : @xmath55 , in which @xmath56 denotes closed channels , @xmath57 denotes open channels .",
    "all the information from closed channels is encapsulated into @xmath58 . when one channel is open for each overall symmetry ( even or odd @xmath10-parity )",

    "this quasi-1d scattering phase shift in the single open channel recovers the pure-1d feature in the low energy limit ( since there is no concept of  closed channels \" in a pure-1d system ) , having the form @xmath61 .",
    "clark pointed out this fact in @xcite , which is equivalent to an observation that a  sudden \" @xmath35 change occurs in the low energy scattering phaseshift when just an infinitesimal @xmath62 is turned on .",

    "[ quasi1ddelta ] .",
