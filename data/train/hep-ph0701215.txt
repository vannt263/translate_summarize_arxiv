    "the string percolation model ( spm ) @xcite for high energy hadronic collisions has a long history of successfully describing experimental observations @xcite . as with any efficacious phenomenological model , one would wish , if not to fully derive it from first principles , to comprehensively understand its relationship with more fundamentally motivated approaches .",
    "the glasma , a highly coherent configuration of classical longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields , has been proposed @xcite as an adequate description of the matter formed immediately after a high energy hadronic collision .",
    "further , it may provide @xcite the necessary physical mechanism for the rapid thermalization observed at rhic and thus for the eventual creation of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the glasma hypothesis follows from the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) approach to high energy hadronic processes @xcite , which in turn provides a theoretically sound and phenomenologically successful description for the infinite momentum wavefunction of a hadronic object .",
    "the cgc / glasma framework tackles the same physical issues as those addressed by the spm .",
    "the relationship between the cgc / glasma and the spm has been hinted at repeatedly , but it is only recently that efforts have been made to understand and explore such a connection @xcite .    in the cgc / glasma framework ,",
    "a nucleus - nucleus collision , viewed in the reference frame of the centre of mass of the collision , is to be thought of as that of two lorentz contracted to the transverse plane sheets of coloured glass @xcite .",
    "the cgc description of the infinite momentum hadronic wavefunction relies on the introduction of a longitudinal momentum separation scale .",
    "the small-@xmath0 component of the wavefunction , a system of non - perturbatively large colour fields , can be described in terms of a classical weizscker - williams field radiated by the large-@xmath0 components of the wavefunction .",
    "such an effective description , in which the relevant dynamical degrees of freedom ( small-@xmath0 gluons ) are described by a classical field with the large-@xmath0 constituents playing the role of a classical static ( in light - cone time ) source , holds for modes with longitudinal momentum close to the separation scale .",
    "the separation scale is , however , arbitrary and can be lowered in successive steps towards increasingly smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this renormalization group procedure is encoded in the b - jimwlk evolution equations @xcite for the cgc .",
    "the small-@xmath0 part of the wavefunction is characterized by a transverse momentum scale  the saturation momentum @xmath1  arising from finite density induced non - linear interactions between the wee partons ( gluons ) .",
    "modes with transverse momentum below @xmath1 are saturated and can not be further populated .",
    "any additional gluon emission will thus result in an increase of the saturation momentum .    immediately after the collision ,",
    "the hadron - hadron system is described by the highly coherent state of the two cgc sheets .",
    "the original transverse fields , associated with the large-@xmath0 components of the hadronic wavefunctions , remain intact and , as the sheets pass through each other , add to themselves a distribution of colour electric and colour magnetic charge .",
    "these charge densities , which are of equal magnitude but opposite sign , act as sources for longitudinal fields living in the region between the parting cgc sheets .",
    "the physical situation described by the glasma , the system of purely longitudinal fields in the region between the parting hadrons , is analogous to that underlying the spm . as the effective number of strings , including percolation effects",
    ", is directly related to the rapidity particle density , we thus have the ` equations ' @xmath2 \\sim [ \\mbox{effective strings } ] \\sim [ \\mbox{particle density } ] \\ , .\\ ] ] it can thus be argued that once the glasma is created through the mechanism outlined above and carefully detailed in @xcite , its evolution can be phenomenologically described in the framework of the spm . in this paper",
    "we follow such a line of thought and address the question of the rapidity evolution of a system of longitudinal fields / strings .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rapitidity ] we introduce our simple model and compute the density distribution in rapidity for both symmetrical and asymmetrical nucleus - nucleus collisions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : limfrag ] we address the issue of limiting fragmentation .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the simplest model that can be imagined to describe the generation of lower centre of mass rapidity objects from higher rapidity ones with asymptotic saturation is the nineteenth century logistic equation for the dynamics of populations @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle density , @xmath5 is the beam rapidity , and @xmath6 the variable @xmath7 plays the role of evolution time",
    ". the parameter @xmath8 controls the low density @xmath9 evolution and must therefore depend on intrinsic parameters of the theory .",
    "the parameter a , responsible for saturation , will naturally depend on the nature of the target and on the energy @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath5-dependent limiting value of @xmath9 , determined by the saturation condition @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12    the condition @xmath13 , defining the separation between the region @xmath14 of low density and positive curvature and the region @xmath15 of high density and negative curvature , gives @xmath16    integrating ( [ eq : log ] ) between @xmath17 and some @xmath18 , and using ( [ eq : rhos ] ) and ( [ eq : rho0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath19 eq . ( [ eq : rhoint ] ) , illustrated in fig.[fig : solution ] , is nothing but a generalization of the fermi distribution , and is known to fit rhic data for rapidity distributions in the case of central nucleus - nucleus colisions @xcite .",
    "there are three parameters in ( [ eq : rhoint ] ) : two from the original differential equation , @xmath20 and @xmath8 , and an additional one , @xmath21 , from the integration of ( [ eq : log ] ) . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are expected to be energy ( or @xmath5 ) dependent , but @xmath8 can be taken , at least approximately , as a constant . in the real fermi distribution",
    "one has @xmath22 , but here we are not dealing with a dominantly fermionic system .",
    "the separation , at @xmath21 , between a dilute region ( @xmath14 ) of objects with rapidity close to the beam rapidity and a dense region ( @xmath15 ) of low rapidity objects is a close analogue of that underlying the cgc framework .",
    "there , one distinguishes between a dilute set of objects ( partons ) carrying a large fraction of the hadronic wave function total longitudinal momentum  the source  and a dense region of partons with small longitudinal momentum . a further dense - dilute separation , that set by the saturation momentum @xmath1 , is considered in the cgc .",
    "such a separation is absent from our simple model since all dependence on tranverse dimensions has been neglected .    ) showing saturation at large @xmath7 , the change of curvature at the point @xmath21 which separates between the dense ( @xmath15 ) and the dilute ( @xmath14 ) regions.,width=377 ]      so far we have concentrated on following a single nucleon pair . in a nucleus - nucleus collision there is a number @xmath23 of nucleons that take part in the collision . in the symmetrical situation of a @xmath24 collision",
    "we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the average number of participants from each nucleus .",
    "both in the cgc approach and in the spm the particle density is proportional to @xmath26 and we can write @xmath27    in order to justify ( [ eq : rhonucleus ] ) we shall look in more detail at the spm .",
    "the particle density is directly related to the effective number of strings @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of strings contributing in a given @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the colour summation reduction factor @xcite @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the percolation transverse density parameter @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the transverse radius of the string and @xmath36 is the radius of the overlapping area which can be obtained from simple geometrical arguments @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proton radius .",
    "the percolation transition occurs for @xcite @xmath39 .",
    "we distinguish two regimes :    1 .",
    "* high density regime * [ @xmath40 + in the dense regime physics is dominated by gluons and sea quarks and the number of strings contributing is proportional to the number of collisions @xcite , that is @xmath41 further , @xmath33 is large such that @xmath42 and ( see ( [ eq : feta ] ) ) : @xmath43 so that we obtain @xmath44 2 .   *",
    "low density regime * [ @xmath45 + in the dilute region physics is dominated by the valence strings and thus @xmath46 , @xmath31 is independent of @xmath26 and we obtain @xcite @xmath44    we find that , at least approximately , the relation @xmath47 holds in both limits thus justifying ( [ eq : rhonucleus ] ) .",
    "we consider next the asymmetrical situation of @xmath48 collisions . in",
    "what follows we shall always assume that @xmath49 and that @xmath50 moves from left to right . let us start by making a simple estimate , based on geometrical arguments , of the number @xmath51 of nucleon - nucleon collisions resulting from a given number of participant nucleons ( see fig.[fig : collision ] ) .",
    "if a tube of @xmath52 nucleons from nucleus @xmath50 interacts with @xmath53 nucleons from nucleus @xmath54 along the collision axis then , as the overlapping area of interaction is @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 clearly , the well known result from glauber calculus @xmath57 is recovered for a symmetrical situation .",
    "the quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on impact parameter : for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; for very large @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in general , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be theoretically calculated or experimentally determined , by using forward / backward calorimeters to detect the non - interacting nucleons : @xmath63 in the forward direction and @xmath64 in the backward direction .",
    "we distinguish again two regimes :    1 .",
    "* high density regime * [ @xmath15 ] + in this case all the strings ( valence and sea ) contribute , their numbers being proportional to the number of collisions @xmath66 and we obtain , from ( [ eq : rhoperc ] ) , @xmath67 2 .",
    "* low density regime * [ @xmath14 ] + the number of strings is essentially proportional to the number of valence strings , which is in turn proportional to the number of participating  forward or backward  nucleons , @xmath69 we obtain , see ( [ eq : rhoperc ] ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71    bearing in mind ( [ eq : rhonucleus ] ) , ( [ eq : rhohigh ] ) , ( [ eq : rholowforw ] ) and([eq : rholowback ] ) we arrive at @xmath72    if we impose , in ( [ eq : rhofinalforw ] ) and ( [ eq : rhofinalback ] ) , the condition @xmath73 ( i.e. , a symmetric situation ) we recover ( [ eq : rhonucleus ] ) and the forward ( [ eq : rhofinalforw ] ) and backward ( [ eq : rhofinalback ] ) distributions become mirror images .",
    "let us see , in this simple situation , how the forward and backward distributions can be matched .",
    "the variable @xmath30 starts , for @xmath74 , at zero and decreases towards the mid - rapidity region reaching a minumum value .",
    "we thus have the constraint @xmath75 in the symmetric case @xmath76 and @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath78 and the distribution is centred around the centre of mass of the nucleon - nucleon system .",
    "in the asymmetric case the denominators in ( [ eq : rhofinalforw ] ) and ( [ eq : rhofinalback ] ) are different , and the condition ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is not sufficient to match the distributions . further requiring @xmath79",
    "we obtain , after combining ( [ eq : constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) , @xmath80 the conclusion is simple : the maximum of the distribution @xmath81 is displaced towards the backward region ( higher nucleonic density ) and for the same @xmath30 , @xmath82 .",
    "these facts are qualitatively seen in the data @xcite .",
    "we shall now be more specific regarding the quantities @xmath8 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we expect @xmath8 to not have a strong dependence on @xmath5 , being essentially a constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the normalized particle density at mid - rapidity and thus should be related to the gluon distribution at small @xmath0 , @xmath83 with @xmath84 @xcite . from energy - momentum conservation @xmath85",
    "was also estimated : @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "regarding @xmath21 we can not assume it to be constant , as in the feynman - wilson gas model .",
    "as @xmath20 increases with rapidity @xmath5 ( [ eq : gluonrise ] ) , energy conservation arguments give that @xmath21 has to decrease linearly with @xmath5 .",
    "we write @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "( [ eq : rhonucleus ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath89 in fact , ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) was used in @xcite as a _ suitable parametrization _ of rhic @xmath90 data from @xcite .",
    "recently , the phenomenon of limiting fragmentation @xcite has received renewed attention @xcite . the particle density",
    "@xmath9 is , in general , a function of both @xmath30 and the beam rapidity @xmath5 .",
    "the limiting fragmentation hypothesis essentially states that for @xmath30 larger than some @xmath5-dependent threshold , the density @xmath9 becomes a function of @xmath30 only . since @xmath21 is a decreasing function of @xmath5 ( [ eq : decdelta ] ) , limiting fragmentation can be recast , in the framework of our model , as @xmath91 { } f(\\delta)\\ , .\\ ] ]    from ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) we can write @xmath91 { }       e^{-\\delta/\\delta } e^{(\\lambda -\\alpha/\\delta ) y}\\ , , \\ ] ] so that limiting fragmentation will hold if , for @xmath92 , one has @xmath93 rhic data @xcite does not seem to favour ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) as recently observed in @xcite , the tendency being for the curve , as the energy increases , to approach a step function . however , the brahms collaboration @xcite points out that the net baryon rapidity loss seems to saturate between sps and rhic energies , which certainly is an indication for the limiting fragmentation regime . in our opinion",
    ", no strong statements should be made as the considered range in @xmath5 is small and qcd corrections most certainly introduce some weak violation of limiting fragmentation .",
    "if we assume ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) to hold , that is that limiting fragmentation should hold in some limit , we arrive at the conclusion that the evolution of @xmath94 with @xmath5 is governed by the same evolution equation as its evolution with @xmath30 ( [ eq : log ] ) .",
    "in fact , from ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) and ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) , one easily arrives at @xmath95 which can be obtained from ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) through the change @xmath96 eq .",
    "( [ eq : change ] ) means that the evolution equation in @xmath5 is , see ( [ eq : log ] ) and ( [ eq : rhos ] ) , @xmath97 where @xmath98 ( obtained from @xmath20 ( [ eq : gluonrise ] ) by using ( [ eq : change ] ) ) is the maximum value of @xmath9 .",
    "if one rescales @xmath9 to a function with maximum value @xmath99 , i.e. perform the transformation @xmath100 , then ( [ eq : yevol ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath101 which is formally equivalent to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite for the @xmath5 evolution of the scattering amplitude of a colour dipole once the dependence on transverse coordinates has been neglected .",
    "we explored the connection between the glasma and an effective description in terms of the spm by introducing a simple model for the distribution in centre of mass rapidity of the particle density .",
    "the solution of this model for a symmetrical nucleus - nucleus collision ( [ eq : rhonucleus ] ) , i.e. a collision of identical nuclei , reproduces ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) the form used as a _",
    "parametrization _ of rhic @xmath90 data @xcite .    in the case of an asymmetrical collision",
    "the maximum of the distribution is , in qualitative agreement with rhic data @xcite , displaced towards backward ( higher nucleonic density ) region .",
    "the expression obtained for the forward ( [ eq : rhofinalforw ] ) and backward ( [ eq : rhofinalback ] ) distributions , supplemented by the matching conditions ( [ eq : matchf ] ) and ( [ eq : matchb ] ) , can be used , since it also reduces to ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) for the limiting case of a symmetrical collision , to perform a comprehensive fit of rhic data and to yield predictions for @xmath102 collisions at the lhc @xcite .    our model yields , in terms of its parameters , a necessary condition ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) for the occurrence of limiting fragmentation .",
    "this condition is not favoured by current rhic data .",
    "the fit of rhic data performed in @xcite yields values for the parameters ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) that do not fulfil ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) .",
    "further , attempting to perform a fit with ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) as a constraint results in a poor description of the data .",
    "it should , however , be noted that , in the fragmentation region , ( [ eq : rhoparam ] ) with parameter values obtained without enforcing limiting fragmentation ( as above ) results in curves @xcite that are indistinguishable from a universal behaviour .",
    "our model predicts a clear violation of this apparent universal behaviour in the fragmentation region for @xmath102 collisions at the lhc .    to the best of our knowledge , ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) first written in @xcite and obtained here from a physically motivated explicit model , is the only possible indication that the apparent universal behaviour of the fragmentation region in rhic data may not correspond to limiting fragmentation .",
    "if limiting fragmentation is enforced into our model , that is the fulfilment of ( [ eq : fragcond ] ) is imposed , than an equation ( [ eq : yevol ] ) for the evolution of the particle density with total rapidity @xmath5 can be written .",
    "this equation can , in turn , be rescaled to an equation ( [ eq : bkanal ] ) _ formally _ identical to the bk equation with no dependence on transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "a note of caution as to the scope of this analogy is due .",
    "the equation obtained here ( [ eq : bkanal ] ) applies to the string / gluon field configuration existing immediately after the collision and describes the evolution with @xmath5 of the multiplicity of strings ( i.e. , particle density ) of any given rapidity length @xmath30 .",
    "cgc inspired studies of limiting fragmentation @xcite rely on that gluon production in the fragmentation region of each of the colliding nuclei can be described , at leading order , in the framework of @xmath106-factorization such that the inclusive cross section for gluon production can be written as the convolution of the unintegrated gluon distributions of the two nuclei .",
    "the kinematical region of fragmentation is such that the relevant bjorken-@xmath0 domains of the fragmenting nucleus ( projectile ) and the target are very different : large bjorken-@xmath0 for the projectile and small bjorken-@xmath0 for the target .",
    "the bk equation is then used to evolve the target to small-@xmath0 ( large @xmath5 ) , while the large-@xmath0 gluon distribution of the projectile is obtained from a phenomenological extrapolation @xcite .",
    "the bk dynamics guarantees that the typical transverse momentum in the projectile is much smaller than that in the target and that unitarity of the target evolution is preserved . limiting fragmentation",
    "follows naturally from the target reaching its black disk limit and the gluon production cross section being determined by the universal large-@xmath0 component of the projectile .    from the above discussion",
    "it should be clear that our formal analogue of bk ( [ eq : bkanal ] ) and the bk equation as used in cgc based studies of limiting fragmentation apply to different stages of the collision and should not be compared directly .",
    "if , however , in future works one finds an evolution equation with @xmath5 for particle density distributions which is formally analogous to the bk equation with no transverse dependence , then this will trivially lead to limiting fragmentation . whether such a strong statement can be made for formal analogues of the full bk equation or for analogues of equations beyond the mean field approximation of bk is not clear to us and clearly merits further consideration .",
