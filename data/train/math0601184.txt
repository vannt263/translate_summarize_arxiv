    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "they are numerous ( @xmath9 generators for a @xmath10 algebra and @xmath11 relations ) , but these relations are simple and therefore convenient .    for comparison : for the simplest case , @xmath12 ,",
    "the matrix units are obvious generators , and the relations between them are simple , but far too numerous ( @xmath13 generators and @xmath14 relations ) .",
    "jacobson was , perhaps , the first to observe that every simple finite dimensional lie algebra can be generated by just a _ pair _ of generators , but he did not specify his pairs , so no discussion of relations was made .",
    "grozman and leites @xcite introduced a pair of generators associated with the principal embedding of @xmath15 , and the relations between them are rather simple ( at least , for computers ) .",
    "there are more generators similar to those grozman and leites had chosen , but experiments performed so far show that the ones grozman and leites considered are most convenient , and are related to various applications @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are , however , certain pairs of generators indigenous only to the @xmath16 series , and only over an algebraically closed field , e.g. @xmath17 .",
    "below , we describe such a pair of generators for @xmath0 and their analogs for @xmath3 and give relations between them .",

    ", the identity matrix @xmath23 spans the center .",
    "so dividing it out leaves @xmath0 with the bracket @xmath24=-2i\\sin\\left ( \\frac{2\\pi}{n}(m_1k_2-m_2k_1 ) \\right ) j_{(m_1+k_1,m_2+k_2)}\\ ] ]    another important application of sylvester s generators is the classical yang - baxter equation for a function taking values in a simple lie algebra @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that for this equation to have elliptic solutions , @xmath4 has to possess two automorphisms of finite order which have no common nonzero eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "sylvester s generators are such automorphisms for @xmath25 ; in fact , @xcite prove that any @xmath4 possessing such automorphisms must be isomorphic to @xmath0 , and the elliptic solutions can be characterised by the images of sylvester s generators ( [ sylv ] ) under this isomorphism .",
    "also , they play a vital role in the study of orthogonal decompositions of lie algebras @xcite .    finally , a more applied subject on which these generators have been used is hydrodynamics and the statistical theory of turbulent fluids and gases , in particular , the study of lattice models of inviscid fluids ( euler fluids ) , see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    the aim of this paper is to give an algorithm that generates @xmath0 and @xmath3 from sylvester s generators and which also produces a presentation for them .",
    "this presentation contains redundancies , but might be of interest for practical problems since it allows quick and easy computations in the adjoint representation .",
    "the main statements are the following ones .",
    "fix an integer @xmath26 .",
    "then the matrices ( [ sylv ] ) are generators for @xmath0 : @xmath27 where for @xmath28 , we set @xmath29 a defining set of relations for generators ( [ sylv ] ) can be obtained in the following way .",
    "the relations @xmath30 prohibit generation of elements of order higher than @xmath31 in both @xmath32 and @xmath33 . besides them",
    ", for each @xmath34 with @xmath35 , except for @xmath36 , @xmath37 relations have to hold , which can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . [ main1 ]    considered as @xmath41 supermatrices on a superspace with an alternating format ( even , odd , even , odd , ... ) , ( [ sylv ] ) are generators for @xmath3 : @xmath42 with the same definition of @xmath34 as in thm .",

    "[ main2 ]    in the following we show why the set of relations indicated in thms .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) , ( [ main2 ] ) is a defining set .",
    "this will then automatically also deliver an upper bound on the number of independent relations for sylvesters s generators .",
    "setting @xmath46 we obtain the matrices @xmath47 which are , clearly , all linearly independent . for @xmath48 , we get the relation ( [ rel1 ] ) .",
    "proceeding likewise , we generate a basis for @xmath49 .",
    "we set @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in matrix form ,",
    "@xmath53 these are all the non - diagonal matrices needed for a basis of @xmath49",
    ". their linear independence is easily checked .",
    "we also immediately read off the relation ( [ rel2 ] ) for @xmath54 .",
    "it remains to generate @xmath55 diagonal matrices , which we do as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and we obtain the relations ( [ rel3])-([rel6 ] ) .",
    "since we have obtained @xmath58 linearly independent matrices , we have found a basis for @xmath49 , see ( [ spansl ] ) .",
    "one might , however , wish to describe @xmath49 as the quotient of the free lie algebra generated by the two sylvester generators modulo certain defining relations . since we know that the matrices @xmath34 span @xmath49 , we know that any commutator of them must yield a relation .",
    "the relations stated above are merely those ones that are first encountered when we proceed through our chosen algorithm for the generation of the basis of @xmath49 . to find out the number and an explicit realization of the minimal defining relations turns out to be quite a tough job , despite the seeming simplicity of the problem .",
    "p.   grozman was able to find those minimal relations for @xmath59 : @xmath60=0;\\\\ \\underline{n=4 } : \\ ; ( \\ad\\,s)^4(d)=-4d,\\quad ( \\ad\\,d)^4(s)=-4s,\\quad [ t_1 ^ 1 , t^1_2]=[d , t^1_3],\\\\ \\quad [ t_1 ^ 1,[t^1_2 , t^1_3]]=-4t^2_1,\\quad [ t_1 ^ 3 , t_3 ^ 1]=0,\\quad2[t^1_2 , t^3_1]=[t^2_1 , [ d , t^1_2]],\\\\ \\quad 2[t^2_1 , t^1_3]=[t^1_2 , [ s , t_1 ^ 2 ] ] , t^2_1]=[s , t^3_1]\\quad [ t^2_1 , t^3_1]=4t^1_2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] with the help of _ mathematica _ and his * superlie * package @xcite , but did not succeed to deduce from ( [ grrel ] ) a general formula . on the other hand , neither the number nor an explicit form of the _ minimal _ set of relations is of great practical importance when working with these generators . rather one would like to have , e.g. , formulae that describe the action of arbitrary products of the elements of @xmath49 in the adjoint representation .",
    "such formulae will be given below and , additionally , a set of relations offered which contains redundancies , but which allows immediate reduction of an arbitrary expression of the form ( with the @xmath61 and @xmath62 being arbitrary elements of @xmath0 ) @xmath63 to a linear combination of the basis elements produced by our algorithm .    by explicit calculation one first verifies that @xmath64=\\frac{(1-a^m)^{k-1}(1-a^{m'})^{k'-1}}{(1-a^{m+m'})^{k+k'-1}}(a^{k'm'}-1)t^{k+k'}_{m+m'}\\ ] ] for any of the @xmath65 defined above .",
    "hereafter , @xmath66 and @xmath67 have to be understood @xmath68 .",
    "this directly shows the following statement .",
    "the result of the application of an arbitrary product of elements in the adjoint representation to a @xmath34 depends _ up to a factor _ only on the number of @xmath33 s and @xmath32 s contained in these operators .",
    "that is , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the number of @xmath33 s and @xmath32 s , respectively , contained in @xmath61 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a constant depending on all the indices .",
    "[ lem1 ]    therefore we conclude that it suffices to check only relations between elements which are at most of degree @xmath31 in both @xmath33 s and @xmath32 s .",
    "if we know all relations of this type , then any relation of a higher degree will follow from these and ( [ rel1])-([rel6 ] ) .    in order to find these relations , it is most convenient to visualise the generated basis as a grid of points .     in @xmath74    fig .",
    "[ fig2p ] shows the basis of @xmath75 , starting from @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the upper left corner .",

    "the other solid points are those that we generate with our algorithm by going only horizontally on each level , and vertically only along the left edge .",
    "the white points are those which are ruled out by the relations ( [ rel1])-([rel6 ] ) , i.e. , they do not represent basis elements of @xmath75 .",
    "now , an arbitrary product of @xmath77-many @xmath78 s and @xmath79-many @xmath80 s applied to @xmath81 corresponds to a path on the grid starting at @xmath81 and reaching @xmath82 , but one which will in general only produce a matrix proportional to @xmath82 , with a factor @xmath83 .",
    "a horizontal step of the path describes the action of @xmath84 , a vertical one the action of @xmath85 . in the picture",
    ", the solid line shows the way our algorithm went to generate @xmath36 , while the dotted lines show the alternative path , i.e. , @xmath86 it is clear that any expression we have to examine can be expressed as a path from @xmath81 to some admissible @xmath34 which only moves right and downwards ( compare to fig .",
    "1 ) . in general , there are @xmath87 however , we can rule out some of these .",
    "the algorithm always uses paths which run through all vertical steps first , then through all horizontal ones ( called the algorithm path in what follows ) .",
    "a relation is obtained by running through any different path and comparing the result to what the algorithm path would have produced at this vertex .    for a path ending at @xmath88 to yield an independent relation , it has to    * end with a vertical step if @xmath89 , * end with a horizontal step if @xmath90 .",
    "[ prop1 ]    look at the @xmath89 case first .",
    "we know that at the vertex where the last vertical step ends , we will have produced a matrix proportional to the one that the algorithm path would have produced there ( cf . lemma [ lem1 ] ) .",
    "thus , at this vertex we obtain a relation .",
    "but if it is followed by horizontal steps , these will then trivially also yield matrices proportional to those that the algorithm would have produced .",
    "thus , the relations we can read off at these vertices are generated from the one obtained at the end of the last vertical step .",
    "an analogous argument holds for @xmath90 , except that at the last step of the algorithm there is a vertical step , so a path producing an independent relation can not have a vertical step at its end .",
    "apart from those vertical steps which lie on the left edge of the grid , a path that leads to @xmath88 and yields an independent relation for @xmath89 must contain all other vertical steps at its end . for @xmath90 , the only path yielding a nontrivial relation is the algorithm path to @xmath91 followed by a horizontal step .",
    "[ cor1 ]    as a counterexample for the @xmath89 case , consider fig .",
    "[ dstep ] .",
    "+    ]    up to vertex @xmath92 , it follows the algorithm path , then going to @xmath93 will yield a relation . but proceeding further horizontally after @xmath93 yields only dependent relations , as seen before .    in the @xmath90 case ,",
    "we have seen in lemma [ lem1 ] that the last step of a path yielding a relation must be horizontal . since going",
    "a horizontal step in the @xmath31-th row always gives zero ( cf .",
    "( [ rel6 ] ) ) , a nontrivial path can only have exactly one horizontal piece at its end .",
    "so the second last step is always the last step of the algorithm to @xmath91 , and therefore any other path leading to @xmath91 followed by a horizontal step would trivially yield a result proportional to what the algorithm path followed by the horizontal step gives .",
    "the relations so obtained are precisely those of ( [ rel6 ] )    this reduces the number of possibly independent relations considerably : for any vertex @xmath34 with @xmath94 , there can now be at most @xmath37 independent relations , which result from the paths leading there and having between zero and @xmath37 vertical steps at their ends . for @xmath95",
    ", there can only be one relation . among the relations",
    "thus obtained , there will still be redundancies , which are not obvious at first glance . to reveal them , one has to apply the jacobi identity and other relations one has already obtained . as an example , look at @xmath36 in @xmath49 for @xmath96 .",
    "two paths lead there , described in ( [ path1 ] ) and ( [ path2 ] ) . since they are both admissible in the sense of proposition [ prop1 ] , one might think that we obtain a relation here between @xmath36 generated by the algorithm and the result of another path .",
    "however , @xmath97 due to the jacobi identity and the last term is of the form @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the two paths _ trivially _ yield the same result , and we obtain no relation here .",
    "we will show now that there are no other interdependencies of this sort except the above one for @xmath36 .",
    "+    it is impossible to trivially identify the result of two paths to a given @xmath88 by rearranging them using the jacobi identity , except for the case @xmath99 , where we have @xmath100 [ comml ]    any admissible path in the sense of lemma [ lem1 ] and its corollary is of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 . for @xmath103",
    ", we obtain the algorithm path . in order to show that two paths give the same result , we want to apply the jacobi identity @xmath104 in such a way that the left hand side of it becomes zero , i.e. is of the form @xmath105 .",
    "this would rule out one of the relations these paths produce .",
    "we see immediately that for this to happen for adjoint operators @xmath106 , the element @xmath107 would have to contain as many @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s as @xmath108 and @xmath109 together .",
    "looking at ( [ path ] ) , which we would like to identify with @xmath110 , this implies @xmath111 .",
    "we have to split ( [ path ] ) in two equally long subpaths , the head ( including @xmath81 ) being @xmath107 and the tail being @xmath112 and each containing @xmath113-many @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s , implying @xmath79 must be even .",
    "for the case @xmath99 , we find that @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 meet these requirements .",
    "let now @xmath117 , @xmath118 and let @xmath106 satisfy the above conditions",
    ". then @xmath107 represents the path of the algorithm to @xmath119 and @xmath120 is of the form @xmath121 .",
    "but we see that it is impossible then to find @xmath122 such that @xmath123 would again be an admissible path .",
    "it is important to note that this still does not exclude all possible dependencies between the relations that various admissible paths yield . by clever rearrangement",
    ", it might still be possible to bring a bracket of two elements into a form which , when expanded into paths , yields only a few admissible paths and several others which run over already excluded pieces",
    ". we could find no way to rule out all such possibilities .",
    "this seems only possible with the help of computers .",
    "but , as stated above , the minimal number might not be of practical interest .",
    "the preceding discussion still gives us an upper bound on the number of relations .",
    "+    the number @xmath124 of independent relations between sylvester s generators is bounded from above by : @xmath125    see fig .",
    "[ n2fig ] for the diagram .    ]",
    "the white dots are ruled out by the relations stated in the beginning , however the dot in the lower right corner is not independent here .",
    "thus , the only relations are @xmath126 which was also grozman s result ( [ grrel ] ) . + as an example for the generic case , look at the @xmath127 grid ( fig .",
    "[ n5fig ] ) .    ]",
    "we get here the following relations :    * 2 relations for the @xmath31-th powers of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , * @xmath130 relations that limit the application of @xmath84 ( the rightmost white dots ) , * @xmath130 relations that limit the application of @xmath85 ( lowermost white dots ) , * 1 relation corresponding to relation ( [ rel4 ] ) ( white dot in the lower right corner ) , * @xmath131 relations for the vertical paths from the first to the second row , * @xmath132 relations for the vertical paths between the second and third row , third and fourth row and so on down to the @xmath133st row , * @xmath130 relations for the horizontal paths in the @xmath31-th row .",
    "this makes a total of @xmath134 relations .",
    "lemma [ lem1 ] and its corollary exclude the possibility that one of them is obtained by another by application of @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "lemma [ comml ] shows that none of them is a consequence of another via a rearrangement using the jacobi identity .",
    "we see that even for @xmath135 , the bound overestimates the exact number of relations . however , the number of relations found in the above manner is only of order @xmath11 , which can be expected to lie pretty close to the true behaviour of @xmath124 so that the relative error will decrease for growing @xmath31 .",
    "but the main advantage of our method is that it explicitly produces a _ presentation _ ( albeit a redundant one ) : all relations can be directly read off from the grid representation of the basis of @xmath0 .",
    "sylvester s generators can as well be used to generate a basis of @xmath3 , and only for this simple ( up to a nontrivial center ) finite dimensional lie superalgebra , see @xcite .",
    "it is most convenient to choose an alternating format for the superspace in which we express the supermatrices , i.e. , if @xmath136 is a basis of this vector space , let the @xmath137 be odd vectors and the @xmath138 be even ones for all @xmath139 .",
    "this format has the advantage that we can use the same matrices @xmath20 as above as sylvester s generators , where now @xmath32 is an even supermatrix and @xmath33 an odd one .",
    "the result obtained below remains valid in any format , but looks nicest in the chosen one . to be able to compare the matrices obtained for the @xmath0 and @xmath3 cases , we put a twiddle on the supermatrices : @xmath140 .",

    "thus , no relation corresponds to ( [ rel4 ] ) in the super case .",
    "we have to add one more relation , which did not exist in the non - super case : the supercommutator of @xmath159 with itself : @xmath160=\\frac{1}{(1+a)(1-a)^{2n-1}}\\tilde{t}^{2n}_2\\qquad\\text{for $ n>1$. } \\label{srel5}\\ ] ] for @xmath161 , this is not a relation , but really generates a new element , see thm .",

    "one can again verify by explicit calculation that @xmath162 $ ] is proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "this extends the validity of lemma [ lem1 ] to the super case . to find a bound for the number of relations again reduces to checking all paths from @xmath164 to the other @xmath165 s .",

    "consider , for example , @xmath166 : @xmath167 here , the first term on the right hand side does not vanish .",
    "therefore the relation between the two paths to @xmath166 that we ruled out as being trivial in the @xmath0 case is nontrivial in the super case . except for this fact , lemma",

    "<S> among the simple finite dimensional lie algebras , only @xmath0 possesses two automorphisms of finite order which have no common nonzero eigenvector with eigenvalue one . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these automorphisms are inner and form a pair of generators that allow one to generate all of @xmath0 under bracketing . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that sylvester was the first to mention these generators , but he used them as generators of the associative algebra of all @xmath1 matrices @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these generators appear in the description of elliptic solutions of the classical yang - baxter equation , orthogonal decompositions of lie algebras , t hooft s work on confinement operators in qcd , and various other instances . </S>",
