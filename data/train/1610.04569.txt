    "the crab nebula has been a consistent emitter of electromagnetic radiation spanning the range from radio to @xmath0-rays for decades .",
    "the radio emission may represent the continual cooling of relic electrons and positrons associated with the initial explosion ( volpi et al .",
    "however , the higher frequency emission , up to photon energies of @xmath1mev , seems to be powered by the conversion of the kinetic energy in the `` cold '' pulsar wind , with bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 , into a `` hot '' distribution of accelerated electrons , at the pulsar - wind termination shock , which is a standing shock generated where the wind encounters the comparatively dense material in the outer region of the synchrotron nebula ( montani & bernardini 2014 ) .",
    "we will refer to the electrons and positrons collectively as `` electrons '' throughout the remainder of the paper .",
    "the pulsar wind termination shock is located at radius @xmath3 cm , which is about an order of magnitude less than the size of the nebula itself ( rees & gunn 1974 ) .",
    "particle acceleration must be occurring at the termination shock in order to explain the entire energy range of the observed quiescent emission ( gaensler & slane 2006 ) .",
    "electrons accelerated at the shock diffuse and advect outward , into the synchrotron - emitting region of the nebula , located downstream from the termination shock ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ; hester 2008 ) .",
    "the dependence of the synchrotron radiation lifetime on the electron energy causes the high - energy component of the quiescent emission to be produced near the shock .",
    "conversely , the radio emission is the most extended component , filling the synchrotron nebula out to a radius of @xmath4 cm .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar , @xmath5 , is converted into radiation with a remarkable efficiency , approaching @xmath6% ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) .    despite the success of the qualitative picture described above",
    ", the physical details of the electron acceleration process required to explain the observed quiescent emission are not very well understood .",
    "in particular , the standard model for first - order fermi acceleration ( also called diffusive shock acceleration ) at the termination shock does not seem to be able to explain the shape of the electron energy distribution implied by the observed synchrotron spectra , due to two problems ( olmi et al .",
    "2015 ; komissarov 2013 ) .",
    "the first is that the termination shock is necessarily relativistic , since the upstream lorentz factor of the `` cold '' pulsar wind is @xmath7 ( lyubarsky 2003 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the efficiency of relativistic shock acceleration is limited ( ellison et al .",
    "the second problem is that the magnetic field orientation at the termination shock is likely to be parallel to the shock front , and this reduces the probability of electrons to recycle back to the upstream side of the shock to experience further acceleration ( gallant et al .",
    "1992 ; sironi et al .",
    "similar problems limit the efficiency of the shock - drift acceleration mechanism ( aharonian et al .",
    "these issues have led to the exploration of models for the quiescent emission that invoke particle acceleration driven by magnetic reconnection in the vicinity of the shock , but it is not yet clear whether this process provides a complete explanation ( coroniti 1990 ; olmi et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "another puzzle related to the observed quiescent emission is the so - called `` @xmath8 problem , '' where the magnetization parameter , @xmath8 , is defined by ( e.g. , sironi & spitkovsky 2014 ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the alfvn velocity and the mass density in the upstream ( cold ) pulsar wind , respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath8 can exceed unity , since the alfvn velocity defined above can exceed @xmath12 .",
    "however , in such cases , the phase velocity of the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) waves is limited to @xmath12 ( heyvaerts et al .",
    "the problem is that the pulsar wind itself must be formed in a region with @xmath13 ( gaensler & slane 2006 ) , whereas the acceleration of the electrons at the termination shock requires @xmath14 in order to satisfy the downstream boundary conditions in the synchrotron nebula ( rees & gunn 1974 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "the formulation of a theoretical explanation for the quiescent emission from the crab nebula already presents significant challenges , as discussed above , but a whole new set of problems emerged with the detection of a series of six remarkable short - duration @xmath0-ray flares from 2010 september through 2013 march , five of which produced high - quality _ fermi_-lat spectra . during these events , the crab nebula brightened by about an order of magnitude in the @xmath15gev energy range . at the peak of the `` super flare '' of 2011 april ,",
    "the crab nebula was the brightest @xmath0-ray source in the sky , with an observed flux exceeding that of the vela pulsar , or any of the @xmath0-ray emitting active galaxies .",
    "the spectral shape of the 2011 april transient was a broad hump in the energy range 0.1 - 1gev , with a rapid increase over a few days , from april 13 - 15 , and a total duration of about 9 days ( buehler at al .",
    "2012 ) .    at its brightest",
    ", the @xmath0-ray luminosity of the 2011 april flare corresponds to @xmath16% of the spin - down power of the rotating neutron star , if emitted isotropically .",
    "this is about 30 times the average value for the crab nebula .",
    "the second - brightest flare was observed in 2007 september ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "2015 ; buehler & blandford 2014 ) , and the statistics were similar to the 2011 flare , including evidence for sub - day variability ( see striani et al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) .",
    "these observation of @xmath0-rays from the crab nebula with energies at least an order of magnitude above the radiation - reaction limit , @xmath17mev , presents serious challenges to the standard astrophysical particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the observed transient gev emission from the crab nebula implies the presence of intense particle acceleration in the vicinity of the pulsar wind termination shock .",
    "the very large value of the upstream lorentz factor @xmath7 implies that relativistic shock acceleration may play an important role in the formation of the high energy @xmath0-rays observed by _ fermi_-lat and _ agile _ ( see buehler & blandford 2014 , and references therein ) .",
    "diffusive acceleration of electrons at a standing shock , whether relativistic or non - relativistic , is mediated by mhd waves , and therefore the maximum acceleration rate is limited to the bohm rate ( lemoine & waxman 2009 ) . however , relativistic shocks can be less efficient accelerators than non - relativistic shocks , once the increase in the scattering time in the relativistic case is included ( sironi et al .",
    "hence , one finds that the particle acceleration rate is limited to the bohm rate whether the acceleration occurs via the first - order fermi process operating at a shock , or via the second - order fermi process due to stochastic wave - particles interactions . in either case , the maximum particle energy that can be achieved is ultimately limited by synchrotron losses , and the value of the maximum energy is obtained by equating the bohm acceleration rate with the synchrotron loss rate .",
    "this yields the radiation - reaction , or `` synchrotron burnoff , '' limit for the electron energy ( see section  [ sec : synchb ] ) . in the end",
    ", the limited efficiency of shock acceleration and stochastic wave - particle acceleration leads to the conclusion that these processes are unable to explain the observed high - energy transient emission from the crab nebula , even when one includes the mild doppler boost that occurs on the downstream side of the shock , unless the inclination angle of the pulsar is @xmath18 ( komissarov 2013 ) .",
    "a number of authors have attempted to explain the observed gev transients from the crab nebula by circumventing the synchrotron burnoff limit using a variety of physical mechanisms .",
    "this limit can be violated ( 1 ) for emission regions with bulk relativistic motion ( e.g. , lyutikov et al .",
    "2012 ) , ( 2 ) by acceleration in a low magnetic - field region and radiation in a high - field region ( e.g. , komissarov & lyutikov 2011 ) , and ( 3 ) if an accelerating electric field is present , as produced , for example , by magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , cerutti et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "significant progress has been made on scenario ( 3 ) using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ( cerutti et al .",
    "2013 , 2014a , 2014b ) , but a complete understanding of the particle acceleration phenomenon occurring in the crab nebula pulsar wind is still lacking . in particular , it is not clear whether the level of magnetic suppression required in the reconnection models can be achieved .",
    "we will also focus on possibility ( 3 ) here , but we will use an alternative approach , based on mathematical analysis of a particle transport equation that includes terms describing electrostatic acceleration , stochastic and shock acceleration , shock - regulated ( advective ) escape , and escape from the nebula via bohm diffusion .",
    "an exact solution is obtained for the resulting electron distribution . in the next section ,",
    "we review some of the key observational diagnostics , and discuss the associated requirements and constraints for the theoretical models .",
    "the characteristic peak synchrotron energy emitted by an isotropic distribution of relativistic electrons with lorentz factor @xmath0 spiraling in a magnetic field with strength @xmath19 is ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron mass , @xmath12 is the speed of light , and the critical magnetic field , @xmath22 , is defined by @xmath23 observational estimates of the magnetic field strength in the crab nebula are typically close to @xmath24 g ( e.g. , aharonian et al .",
    "the generation of synchrotron emission with an energy of @xmath16gev by an isotropic electron distribution in the presence of such a field therefore requires a lorentz factor @xmath25 .",
    "the synchrotron energy loss rate per electron , averaged over an isotropic distribution of pitch angles , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the thomson cross section .",
    "the associated synchrotron momentum loss rate can be written as @xmath28 where the constant @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 the synchrotron lifetime of the relativistic electrons producing the flare can be estimated using @xmath31 which can be combined with equation  ( [ eq4newnew ] ) to obtain @xmath32 we can also express the synchrotron lifetime as a function of the peak flare photon energy , @xmath33 , by using equation  ( [ eq1newnew ] ) to eliminate the lorentz factor @xmath0 in equation  ( [ eq5newnew ] ) , obtaining @xmath34 for a peak photon energy @xmath35gev , and field strength @xmath36 g , we obtain roughly the observed flare duration , which supports the interpretation that the observed @xmath0-ray flares are the result of synchrotron emission ( e.g. , abdo et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the similarity between the two timescales also suggests that the particle distribution during the peak of the flare is close to equilibrium .",
    "we will use this to motivate our consideration of the steady - state transport equation introduced in section  [ sec : sste ] .",
    "however , the issue of time dependence will be revisited in section  9.3 .",
    "the classical radiation - reaction ( synchrotron burnoff ) limit places severe constraints on the particle acceleration mechanism required to power the observed emission , as discussed below .",
    "variability on shorter timescales ( @xmath16day ) may have also been observed ( buehler et al . 2012 ; mayer et al . 2013 ; striani et al . 2013 ) , perhaps as a consequence of instabilities in the structure of the termination shock and the strength of the associated magnetic field .",
    "the minimum timescale for the acceleration of relativistic electrons via energetic collisions with mhd waves is the larmor timescale , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the larmor radius and @xmath39 denotes the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "the synchrotron burnoff limit is obtained by equating the larmor timescale with the synchrotron loss timescale , given by equation  ( [ eq5newnew ] ) , which yields an expression for the maximum lorentz factor , @xmath40 , that can be achieved via mhd wave acceleration in the presence of a magnetic field of strength @xmath19 , neglecting other factors .",
    "the result obtained is @xmath41 we can substitute equation  ( [ eq8newnew ] ) into equation  ( [ eq1newnew ] ) to obtain the radiation - reaction - limited peak synchrotron energy , given by @xmath42 this is far below the highest energy observations which are in excess of 1gev .",
    "hence , the synchrotron burnoff limit implies that particle acceleration via interaction with mhd waves is insufficient to explain the energetics of the observed crab nebula @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "the observation of @xmath0-rays with energies exceeding the radiation - reaction limit given by equation  ( [ eq9newnew ] ) has motivated speculation that the radiating electrons are accelerated electrostatically in a magnetic reconnection region where electric fields are induced ( e.g. , buehler at al .",
    "2012 ; cerutti et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , numerical simulations based on electrostatic acceleration in a magnetic reconnection region require the presence of a @xmath43 mg magnetic field and pev electrons ( cerutti et al .",
    "2012 , 2014a ) .",
    "this field strength is substantially higher than that indicated by the multi - wavelength observations of the quiescent spectrum , which suggest that the ambient field has strength @xmath36 g ( e.g. , aharonian et al .",
    "2004 ; meyer & horns 2010 ) .",
    "these studies focused on the comprehensive broad - band ( from radio through hard @xmath0-rays ) spectrum to infer the average ambient magnetic field responsible for the observed synchrotron emission from the crab nebula .    in this paper",
    ", we seek to develop a self - consistent theoretical framework that can account for all of the crab nebula @xmath0-ray flare spectra detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat , based on the standard ambient magnetic field strength @xmath36 g .",
    "our model is based on a one - zone electron transport equation that includes terms describing particle injection , stochastic acceleration , electrostatic acceleration , shock acceleration , radiative losses , and particle escape .",
    "the model should be interpreted as a spatial average over the acceleration and emission regions , which may either be co - located or separate regions .",
    "the transport equation is solved to obtain a closed - form expression for the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons , which is then used to compute the @xmath0-ray spectrum produced via direct synchrotron emission .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : ptf ] , we provide an overview of the physical background and develop the specific terms to be employed in the fundamental electron transport equation . in section",
    "[ sec : sste ] we introduce and discuss the associated steady - state fokker - planck equation . in section",
    "[ sec : pdars ] we obtain the exact solution for the electron green s function , and we develop expressions for computing the corresponding synchrotron spectra . in section  [ sec : crabapp ] we apply the model to the transient @xmath0-ray emission observed from the crab nebula , and in section  [ sec : afterglow ] we compute and discuss the afterglow spectra .",
    "the flare energy budgets are analyzed and discussed in section  [ sec : energybudget ] . in section  [ sec : parcon ] we examine the parameter constraints for the model , and in section  [ sec : discuss ] we review our main conclusions and discuss their astrophysical significance .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flares observed from the crab nebula significantly exceed the classical radiation - reaction limit , and therefore a natural explanation could be that the radiating electrons are accelerated , at least in part , by an electric field created in a region of magnetic reconnection on the downstream side of the termination shock ( e.g. , komissarov 2013 ) .",
    "although a variety of numerical simulations have been employed to model this phenomenon , they have not been entirely successful at explaining the shape of the observed @xmath0-ray spectra , and furthermore , they tend to invoke magnetic field strengths that are somewhat higher than those implied by observations of the crab nebula .",
    "the uncertainties regarding the numerical simulations have motivated us to revisit the problem using an analytical approach based on a transport equation that includes terms describing electrostatic acceleration , stochastic acceleration , shock acceleration , synchrotron losses , and particle escape .",
    "since synchrotron losses are included in the transport equation , the subsequent calculation of the @xmath0-ray synchrotron spectrum is self - consistent . by describing the particle distribution , and the resulting radiation spectrum , using analytical expressions , we are able to study of a wide range of parameter values , while maintaining complete control over the relative importance of the various physical processes .",
    "conversely , complex numerical simulations can sometimes make it difficult to pinpoint the specific effect of each process , and they are usually not amenable to fitting observational data . another advantage of closed - form analytical models it that they can often be evaluated in real - time , allowing one to perform quantitative fits to the observational data , and they are also useful for benchmarking more sophisticated numerical simulations .",
    "the similarity of the flare duration and the synchrotron lifetime given by equation  ( [ eq6newnew ] ) suggests that the electron distribution achieves an approximate equilibrium during the peak of the flare .",
    "we will use this fact to justify our utilization of a steady - state transport equation when we solve for the electron distribution in section  [ sec : pdars ] .",
    "the relativistic electrons ejected from the central pulsar travel outward in the form of a cold , relativistic wind , with bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 . since the particles propagate along the field lines , with a negligible transverse component , very little synchrotron emission is generated in the cold wind , and the particles are mainly subject to adiabatic losses ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "most of the observed radio emission is produced beyond the pulsar wind termination shock , which is located at radius @xmath3 cm .",
    "the spatial distribution of the radiation implies the existence of an efficient acceleration mechanism operating at the termination shock .",
    "an extension of this model into the @xmath0-ray region has naturally led to the suggestion that the @xmath0-rays emitted during the crab nebula flares may also be produced in the vicinity of the shock ( e.g. begelman 1998 ; komissarov & lyubarsky 2004 ; uzdensky et al .",
    "the particle acceleration required to power the @xmath0-ray flares may occur via a variety of mechanisms , including first - order fermi acceleration due to multiple shock crossings , second - order fermi acceleration due to stochastic interactions with a random field of mhd waves , and direct electrostatic acceleration in the electric field generated in the magnetic reconnection region surrounding the shock . in this section",
    ", we derive the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients describing the stochastic interaction with the random field of mhd waves .",
    "the strongest possible mhd acceleration occurs in the bohm regime , when the particle mean - free path , @xmath44 , is comparable to the larmor radius ( krall & trivelpiece 1986 ) , @xmath45 where @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath39 is the magnitude of the electron charge , and @xmath19 is the local magnetic field strength .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the mean - free path relative to the larmor radius by introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath46 , where @xmath47 the value of @xmath46 determines the diffusion regime in which we are operating . in an ordered magnetic field , the larmor radius represents the minimum mean - free path for interactions with mhd waves , so that @xmath48 , with the limiting case corresponding to bohm diffusion .",
    "we develop an approximate quantitative expression for @xmath46 below .",
    "focusing on the bohm diffusion limit , in an ordered field , the differential probability of scattering with an mhd wave in the distance interval @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 .",
    "however , in a disordered field , the particles also experience large - angle deflections due to encounters with stationary kinks , with a mean spacing equal to the magnetic coherence length , @xmath51 .",
    "the differential probability of deflection due to an encounter with a kink in the distance interval @xmath49 is @xmath52 . taking both bohm diffusion and magnetic deflection into consideration ,",
    "the total scattering probability per unit length , @xmath53 , is given by the sum @xmath54 substituting for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and setting @xmath57 , we find that the effective mean - free path @xmath44 is related to @xmath38 and @xmath51 via @xmath58 and the corresponding expression for @xmath46 is therefore ( see equation  ( [ eqmfp ] ) ) @xmath59 this result is reasonably consistent with the mean - free path variation obtained by zank et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using numerical simulations of charged particle diffusion in magnetized plasmas .    in general",
    ", one expects that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the turbulent component of the magnetic field ( hussein & shalchi 2014 ; giacalone & jokipii 1999 ; dosch et al .",
    "hence , in a turbulent field with @xmath62 , it follows that @xmath63 , and that is the situation assumed here .",
    "this is consistent with equation  ( [ eqetaexp ] ) provided the coherence length of the magnetic field is not much smaller than the larmor radius for the particles emitting the @xmath0-rays , which would imply that @xmath64 .",
    "once the value of @xmath46 is specified , the associated spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath65 , for diffusion with mean - free path @xmath66 is computed using ( drge & schlickeiser 1986 ; reif 1965 ) @xmath67      the spatial transport of the electrons in the environment surrounding the pulsar wind termination shock is governed by a combination of advection in the wind and spatial diffusion relative to the wind . in the crab nebula ,",
    "the particle acceleration and the production of the observed @xmath0-rays may occur in separate geometrical regions ( e.g. , cerutti et al .",
    "2012 ) , but it is not clear whether this has to be the case .",

    ", the dominant escape mechanism is expected to be a combination of shock - regulated ( advective ) escape on small scales , and bohm diffusion on large scales , as discussed in section  [ sec : pe ] .    based on these physical considerations , the transport equation we will utilize to model the evolution of the relativistic electron momentum distribution , @xmath69 , in the pulsar wind nebula",

    "in addition to the second - order fermi acceleration discussed in section  [ sec : smhd ] , resulting from stochastic wave - particle interactions , the electrons also experience a combination of electrostatic and shock acceleration in the vicinity of the termination shock ( abdo et al .",
    "we discuss these two processes in this section .",
    "the shape of the electron energy distribution resulting from first - order fermi acceleration at the pulsar wind termination shock depends on the amount of time the particles spend in the acceleration region , which is regulated by the combined action of spatial diffusion and advection . on the upstream side of the termination shock ,",

    "2001 ) . in studies of particle acceleration in super - driven relativistic blast waves , which is the typical application of the theory , the lorentz transformation between the shock frame and the frame at infinity creates a large deviation between the time and energy measured in the two frames . however , in our application , the pulsar wind termination shock is a stationary phenomenon , and therefore the shock frame is equivalent to the frame at infinity .",
    "hence in the shock frame , the acceleration and cycle times can be estimated by writing ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) @xmath100 where @xmath38 is the larmor radius ( see equation  ( [ eq14newnew ] ) ) .",
    "particles crossing the shock for the first time will experience an energy gain on the order of @xmath101 in the frame of the upstream gas , but subsequent crossings will increase the particle energy by a much smaller factor due to the dynamics of escape and acceleration ( achterberg et al .",

    "the efficiency can be further reduced in the magnetic field is parallel to the shock front ( lemoine & waxman 2009 ) , which may be the case in pulsar - wind termination shocks ( gallant et al .",
    "1992 ; sironi et al .",
    "hence we will estimate the first - order fermi acceleration rate experienced by the electrons due to multiple shock crossings in the laboratory ( shock ) reference frame by writing ( dermer & menon 2009 ) @xmath102 where the final ( constant ) result follows from equations  ( [ eq14newnew ] ) and ( [ eq23newnew ] ) , and @xmath103 is an efficiency factor reflecting the fact that the particle acceleration rate can not exceed the bohm rate , even in a relativistic shock ( lemoine & waxman 2009 ) .",

    "this is called `` bohm diffusive escape '' ( e.g. , dermer & menon 2009 ) .",
    "electrons with an intermediate momentum have a mean - free path that is large enough to diffuse back across the shock into the upstream region ( so that they experience additional acceleration ) , but not so large that they escape from the nebula .    in a proper three - dimensional numerical particle transport model , the large- and small - scale behavior of the spatial diffusion and advection processes",

    "however , the spatial geometry of the problem is treated implicitly through the utilization of a realistic dependence of the escape timescale , @xmath68 , on the particle momentum , @xmath71 , as expressed by equation  ( [ eq37 ] ) . at low energies ,",
    "the electrons are trapped in the flow , and the escape of the particles is regulated by advection , which sweeps the particles away from the shock . at higher energies , the particle mean - free path is large enough to increase the probability of recycling back into the upstream region , so that the electrons can experience further acceleration . at the highest energies in the model , the larmor radius is comparable to the termination - shock radius , @xmath3 cm , and the electrons are able to escape into the outer region of the nebula .",
    "the transition between the dominance of the two escape mechanisms occurs at the cross - over lorentz factor , @xmath234 ( equation  ( [ eq38 ] ) ) , and the highest - energy electrons accelerated in our model reach a peak lorentz factor of @xmath371 , which is consistent with the hillas condition for the crab nebula termination shock radius ( see equation  ( [ eq35 ] ) ) .",
    "we have also reported computations of the synchrotron afterglow emission produced by the accelerated electrons after they escape into the downstream ( outer ) cooling region in figure  5 .",
    "we predict that the afterglow should be observable for a maximum of approximately 3 weeks .",
    "however , this estimate neglects the effects of adiabatic cooling and the decreasing magnetic field strength in the outer region that the escaping particles will experience as that advect through the synchrotron nebula .      the primary goal of this paper is to develop a new theoretical explanation for the @xmath0-ray flare spectra observed from the crab nebula by _ fermi_-lat . however , it is also interesting to determine the level of x - ray emission predicted by our model , since the x - ray spectrum is constrained by previous work .",
    "an important characteristic of the _ fermi_-lat flares",
    "is that there is no corresponding increase in flux in the radio , optical , uv , or x - ray bands ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ; weisskopf et al .",
    "this observational fact has led many authors to reject the notion of significant doppler boosting as the underlying cause for the enhanced @xmath0-ray emission that characterize the flares ( buehler & blandford 2014 ) .",
    "weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2013 ) fit the april 2011 @xmath0-ray flare spectrum using standard spectral analysis software , and extrapolated the fit down to the x - ray region . by employing a statistical pixel analysis routine , they estimated the upper limit on the x - ray flux coincident with the april 2011 flare . in figure 9",
    ", we compare the weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2013 ) upper limits with our calculation of the april 2011 flare spectrum , computed assuming @xmath161 g . we find that our model spectrum predicts x - ray fluxes below the upper limits obtained by weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , which helps to establish further confidence in our model .",
    "the characteristics of the high - energy synchrotron emission produced during the observed @xmath0-ray flares from the crab nebula depend sensitively on the strength of the local magnetic field .",
    "rigorous multi - wavelength observational campaigns have concluded that the average strength of the ambient magnetic field in the crab nebula is @xmath372 g ( aharonian et al .",
    "therefore , in the study presented here , we have generally set the field strength using @xmath373 g . however , near the termination shock",
    ", compression and reconnection of the turbulent magnetic field can cause a reduction in the local magnetic field strength ( cerutti et al . 2013 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to reconsider some of our conclusions using a lower estimate for the magnetic field strength @xmath19 . in this section",
    ", we present a summary study of the resulting @xmath0-ray flare spectrum for the april 2011 flare for the case with @xmath374 g .    in figure 8 , we plot the resulting theoretical @xmath0-ray peak flare spectrum obtained when @xmath374 g , and compare it with our earlier result , obtained using the canonical field strength @xmath373 g . for the calculation with the reduced field strength @xmath374 g ,",
    "the model parameters are given by @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 , and @xmath379 .",
    "we observe that the reduced magnetic field strength requires a higher value for the acceleration parameter @xmath380 in order to roughly match the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of electric and magnetic fields in this case increases to @xmath340 in order to provide sufficient @xmath0-ray emission at the highest energies .",
    "however , the spectrum also exhibits an excess at lower energies , which suggests that the model with @xmath381 g would probably produce an incorrect photon power - law index for any combination of acceleration and loss parameters .",
    "these results tend to support the nominal value @xmath161 g that we have adopted in most of our calculations , based on previous observational estimates of the ambient field strength in the crab nebula .      in agreement with earlier models",
    ", we find that shock and stochastic acceleration alone can not provide sufficient power to explain the @xmath0-ray luminosity observed during the recent series of crab nebula flares observed using _ fermi_-lat ( e.g. cerutti et al . 2012 ) . in each case",
    ", we conclude that the electrons are primarily accelerated by relatively strong electric fields generated in the region of magnetic reconnection in the vicinity of the pulsar wind termination shock , in agreement with earlier work . since the model developed here is analytical , and it provides a very flexible and convenient tool that can be used to conduct a broad range of parameter studies",
    ". it should be straightforward to port the model into any of the standard data analysis packages in order to perform quantitative fits , which we do not pursue in this paper .",
    "we have assumed here that the electron distribution during the flare peak is close to equilibrium , based on the similarity between the synchrotron loss timescale and the typical @xmath0-ray flare duration ( see section 1.3 ) , and therefore we have utilized a steady - state model .",
    "however , this is clearly a crude approximation of what is intrinsically a time - dependent phenomenon . in future work",
    ", we intend to pursue a fully time - dependent simulation , and we also plan to analyze the spectrum resulting from the acceleration of an injected power - law distribution of electrons , rather than the exclusively monoenergetic injection scenario considered here .",
    "we will also examine the effects of mild doppler boosting and anisotropy in the emission beam , which will tend to decrease the power requirements listed in table  2 .",
    "we believe that this work will help to guide and inform future studies dedicated to understanding the properties of crab pulsar magnetosphere and wind .",
