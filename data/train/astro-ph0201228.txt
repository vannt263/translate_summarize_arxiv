    "supernovae ( sne ) represent the final , explosive stage in the evolution of certain varieties of stars ( see , e.g. , woosley & weaver 1986 ; arnett et  al .  1989 ; wheeler & harkness 1990 ; filippenko 1997 , for reviews of sn types and explosion mechanisms ) .",
    "they synthesize and expel heavy elements , heat the interstellar medium , trigger vigorous bursts of star formation , create neutron stars and sometimes black holes , and produce energetic cosmic rays .",
    "type ia sne ( sne ia ) , among the most luminous of sne , are exceedingly useful cosmological tools and have been used to study the expansion history of the universe .",
    "these studies ( riess et  al .  1998 , 2001 ; perlmutter et  al .",
    "1999 ; see filippenko 2001 for a recent summary ) reveal the surprising result that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating , perhaps due to a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "sne are clearly among the most interesting and important constituents of the universe and should be vigorously studied .",
    "detailed spectral and photometric observations of sne can be used to study the properties of sne , compare sne at different redshifts , and gain insights into the evolutionary paths that lead to these energetic explosions . however , until recently , most relatively nearby sne were found either sporadically , in images taken for other purposes , or at a considerable time after the explosion .",
    "moreover , systematic follow - up observations were scarce for all but a minor fraction of the sne . during the past few years , however , the situation has changed dramatically , as robotic ( or nearly robotic ) telescopes have been dedicated to the search for and follow - up of sne ( filippenko et  al .",
    "the two outstanding examples are the beijing astronomical observatory supernova search ( baoss ; li et  al .",
    "1996 ) with a 0.6-m telescope , and the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; treffers et  al .  1997 ; li et  al .",
    "2000 ; filippenko et  al .",
    "2001 ) with the 0.8-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) .",
    "kait reaches a limit of @xmath1 19 mag ( 4@xmath2 ) in 25-s unfiltered , unguided exposures , while 5-min guided exposures yield @xmath3 20 mag .",
    "2500@xmath47000 galaxies ( most with @xmath5 6000 km s@xmath6 ) are surveyed during any particular season , with a cycle time of @xmath1 3@xmath410 days .",
    "the search software automatically subtracts new images from old ones and identifies sn candidates which are subsequently examined by undergraduate research assistants .",
    "loss discovered its first sn in 1997 ( sn 1997bs ; treffers et  al .",
    "1997 ; van dyk et  al .",
    "2000 ) , then 20 sne in 1998 , 40 in 1999 , 36 in 2000 , and 68 in 2001 .",
    "together , loss and baoss have found a total of over 180 sne in the past 5 years .",
    "recently , loss teamed up with michael schwartz in arizona , forming the lick observatory and tenagra observatory supernova search ( lotoss ) , allowing more sne to be discovered and followed .    since most of the sne found during these systematic searches are discovered very early in their development , and have a large amount of follow - up time devoted to them , they are among the world s best - studied sne ( see , e.g. , li et  al .  2000 , 2001a ;",

    "2002a , b ) .",
    "li , filippenko , & riess ( 2001 ) and li et  al .",
    "( 2001b ) also show that these surveys are least affected by observational biases , and provide the most accurate luminosity function for sne .",
    "the rate of intrinsically peculiar sne  ia , for example , is found to be unexpectedly high .",
    "the explosion of a sn leaves few traces of the star that underwent the catastrophic event .",
    "an important clue to the nature of the progenitor is its environment ( e.g. , boffi 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , most studies of the sites of sne have been hampered by the limited spatial resolution of ground - based observations ( e.g. , van den bergh 1988 ; panagia & laidler 1991 ; boffi , sparks , & macchetto 1999 ) .",
    "this problem can be partially overcome by using _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ archival images ( e.g. , van dyk et  al .",
    "1999a , b , 2000 ) .",
    "however , although the chance that the site of any particular sn has been imaged by _ hst _ during other programs is rapidly growing , it is still relatively low . also , some of the positions of older sne ( prior to 1990 ) were uncertain , compromising studies of their local environment .    to remedy this , an _ hst",
    "_ snapshot survey program ( go-8602 ) of recent , nearby sne was conducted starting in cycle 9 , requesting wfpc2 images of the sites of 23 loss and baoss sne with @xmath76000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these sne provide the best spatial resolution and have accurate positions ( often better than @xmath8 ) .",
    "in addition , they were generally discovered early in their development , and had extensive ground - based follow - up studies .",
    "45 out of the 70 ( @xmath9 ) requested observations have been made , with 20 out of the 23 sne ( @xmath10 ) observed at least once and 13 ( @xmath11 ) of the sne having images in more than one filter ; thus , the chances of imaging the sites of specific sne are much higher than by using the archive alone .",
    "moreover , the data are all obtained in a uniform way using the same set of filters .",
    "one advantage of concentrating the snapshot survey on very recent , nearby , well - studied sne is that many of the sne themselves are still visible in the @xmath12 images , providing late - time photometry superior to that achieved from the ground ; at such late times , the sne are so faint that their ground - based photometry is contaminated by neighboring stars within the seeing disk .",
    "late - time photometry , especially through more than one filter , provides not only useful information on the underlying physics for the lingering light , such as radioactive decay of long - lived isotopes , interaction with circumstellar matter , and light echoes , but also the relative brightness of sne still present in  template \" images taken at various epochs compared to their maximum light . to obtain proper photometry of a sn , which often occurs in a complicated background (",
    "e.g. , spiral arms or h  ii regions ) , observers are required to take template images of the host galaxy a year or two after the discovery , and then do image subtraction .",
    "it is often assumed that the light of the sn is essentially negligible in these template images , but as we later discuss in this paper , some sne ( especially those of type ii ) are quite long - lived and may contaminate the template images .",
    "detailed analysis of the sn environments is still underway , and the results will be discussed elsewhere . in this paper , we report on sne recovered in the snapshot images .",
    "section 2 contains a description of the observations and analysis of the photometry , while   3 presents the light curves of all recovered sne , details of individual sne , and comparison of late - time light - curve shapes and decline rates .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   4 .",
    "table 1 lists the observational details of all 12 sne recovered in the snapshot program go-8602 , while figure 1 shows the finding charts for the sne .",
    "all the snapshot images were obtained in pairs to facilitate removal of cosmic rays .    to properly identify the sne in the wfpc2 images , we have used the best available astrometry in the literature ( details of the sources for astrometry can be found in ",
    "3 ) , and derived the position of the sne using the pointing information in the image headers . in most cases ,",
    "each of the sne identified in figure 1 is the only object within a 0@xmath13 radius error circle .",
    "three exceptions are sne 1997bs , 1999gi , and 1999gq .",
    "identification of sn 1997bs in the snapshot images was accomplished by comparing them to the finder chart in van dyk et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , where sn 1997bs was apparent in a co - added deep @xmath12 archival wfpc2 f555w image .",
    "sn 1997bs is only marginally detected in our f555w image taken on 2001 march 4 ut ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , and not detected in the two f814w images ( see details in   3 ) .",
    "three stars are within the 0@xmath13 radius error circle of sn 1999gi ; following smartt et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we identify the brightest object as the sn .",
    "no object is within the 0@xmath13 radius error circle of the position of sn 1999gq .",
    "however , our estimate for the brightness of sn 1999gq ( by comparison with the light curve of the sn ii - p 1988a ; turatto et al .",
    "1993 ) is 22.0@xmath140.3 mag at the time of the snapshot observation , so the sn should be visible in the image .",
    "fortunately , we have several excellent kait images of sn 1999gq , and after rotating one of them to the orientation of the wfpc2 image , we measured the relative angular distance between the sn and several bright stars from the kait image , and identified the sn using the corresponding offsets from these bright stars seen in the wfpc2 four - chip mosaic .",
    "we find that the pointing for the snapshot observations of sn 1999gq is off by more than 6@xmath15 , relative to information in the data header .",
    "to measure sn magnitudes in the snapshot images , we have used the ",
    "hstphot \" package developed by dolphin ( 2000a ) .",
    "the data quality images are used to mask bad pixels and defects in the data image using the program _",
    "mask_. the program _ crmask _ is used to remove cosmic rays , and the program _ coadd _",
    "is used to combine the two images . the program _ getsky _",
    "is then used to determine the sky value at each pixel .",
    "hot pixels are identified and masked using the program _",
    "hotpixels_. following all this preprocessing ,",
    "the images are fed into the program _",
    "hstphot _ , where the magnitudes in the wfpc2 system are measured for all the stars using the zero points and charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) determined by dolphin ( 2000b ) .",
    "we have used option flag 10 for _ hstphot _ , which is a combination of turning on local sky determination and turning off aperture corrections .",
    "turning on local sky determination is recommended by the hstphot manual , while turning off aperture corrections is necessary because for most of the snapshot images , there are not enough bright and isolated stars to determine a reliable aperture correction .",
    "default aperture corrections are applied to the photometry obtained with the _ hst _ filters ; these are probably accurate , in general , to 0.02 mag in f555w and f814w , and to 0.05 mag in f675w ( cf .",
    "the hstphot manual ) .",
    "these uncertainties are combined in quadrature with the photometric uncertainties returned by _",
    "hstphot _ , and",
    "the resulting uncertainties are reported in the last column of table 1 .    ideally , to tie the magnitudes in the wfpc2 system ( table 1 ) to the early - time light curves of the sne obtained from the ground [ which are typically in the standard johnson ( @xmath16 ) and cousins ( @xmath17 ) system ] , a magnitude transformation such as those described by holtzman et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and dolphin ( 2000b ) should be applied .",
    "( note , however , that although these transformations are generally applicable to stars , they might not be as applicable to emission - line dominated sources , such as sne . )",
    "we have done this for sn 2000cx ( see discussion below ) , but not for the other sne because of the difficulty of getting late - time color information for them .",
    "the differences in these two magnitude systems can be estimated using the procedure described by dolphin ( 2000b ) [ his equation ( 1 ) and tables 6 and 7 ] :    @xmath18 @xmath19    where @xmath0 and @xmath20 are the magnitudes in the standard ground - based system , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the magnitudes in the wfpc2 system .",
    "a reasonable range for the late - time @xmath23 color of the sne is @xmath40.5 to 2 mag , which indicates that the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath21 , as well as between @xmath20 and @xmath22 , are smaller than 0.04 mag . in subsequent discussions , we will neglect the difference between these two systems .    for sn 2000cx ,",
    "since the f675w and f814w observations were taken at the same time , we can use the following equations ( also from dolphin 2000b ) to transform the magnitudes :    @xmath24 @xmath25    the @xmath26 color should have minimal difference from its wfpc2 system equivalent @xmath27 , which is 0.55 mag from table 1 .",
    "when this color is applied to the above equations , we get @xmath28 = 22.10@xmath140.06 and @xmath20 = 21.38@xmath140.04 , which are the magnitudes for the sn 2000cx snapshot observations used in subsequent discussions .",
    "figures 2  5 show the light curves of the 12 sne recovered in the snapshot observations .",
    "the solid circles are the photometry from @xmath12 , while the open circles represent ground - based measurements .",
    "as discussed above , the f555w and @xmath0-band magnitudes are plotted together , as are f814w with the @xmath20 band .",
    "the sources of the ground - based photometry are listed below in the notes on individual sne .",
    "sn 1995n in mcg @xmath402@xmath438@xmath4017 ( also arp 261 ) was discovered by pollas ( 1995 ) on 1995 may 5 .",
    "optical spectra of the object obtained by benetti , bouchet , & schwarz ( 1995 ) and by garnavich & challis ( 1995 ) showed it to be a type iin sn ; specifically , it resembles sn 1988z in its characteristics ( see filippenko 1997 for a summary of sne  iin ) .",
    "van dyk et  al .",
    "( 1996a ) reported the detection of radio emission from the sn at 3.6 cm on 1995 june 16 and also provided a precise position of the sn at @xmath29 = 14@xmath3049@xmath3128@xmath32.313 , @xmath33 ( equinox j2000.0 ) , which are the coordinates we used to locate the sn in the snapshot observations .",
    "the ground - based photometry ( open circles in figure 2 ) consists of previously unpublished observations taken at the 1.0-m nickel telescope at lick observatory except the two latest @xmath0-band points , which were obtained from schaefer & roscherr ( 1999 ) and schaefer ( 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , the schaefer ( 2001 ) observations ( which yielded @xmath0 = 21.1@xmath140.3 mag ) with the mcdonald observatory 2.1-m telescope were made on the same ut date as our @xmath12 snapshot observation ( which yielded @xmath21 = 21.213@xmath140.023 ) , and the reported magnitudes agree with each other very well .",
    "the earliest nickel observations taken on 1995 may 23 ( 18 days after discovery ) yielded a @xmath0 mag of 18.72 , about 1.2 mag fainter than the reported brightness at the time of discovery ( pollas 1995 ) .",
    "we suspect that the discovery magnitude is erroneous ; fransson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that the sn was already about 10 months old at the time of discovery , and it declined only by another 1.2 mag in @xmath34 days after the first nickel observation .",
    "as noted by schaefer & roscherr ( 1999 ) and schaefer ( 2001 ) , sn 1995n has a very slow optical decline rate , only 2.5 mag ( 3  from the nickel photometry ) in the @xmath0 band over @xmath12200 days after discovery .",
    "this is consistent with the slow spectral evolution reported by fransson et al .",
    "the decline rate for the @xmath0 band increased from ( @xmath35 mag)/(100 days ) ( from discovery to about 1400 days after discovery ) to ( @xmath36 mag)/(100 days ) ( from about 1400 days to 2200 days after discovery ) , while the decline rate for the @xmath20 band decreased from ( @xmath37 mag)/(100 days ) ( from discovery to about 1900 days after discovery ) to ( @xmath38 mag)/(100 days ) ( from about 1900 to 2200 days after discovery ) .",
    "although the decline rates in the two passbands seem to change in opposite directions , the light curves are not sufficiently well sampled to make any definitive conclusions .",
    "roscherr & schaefer ( 2000 ) investigated the light echoes from dust formed in the circumstellar wind of sne  iin , and concluded that they can not properly account for the slow decline seen in sne  iin 1988z and 1997ab .",
    "they suggested that the shock interaction of the sn ejecta colliding with the circumstellar wind is the dominant source of late - time emission of these two sne  iin , consistent with previous suggestions ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ; aretxaga et al .",
    "1999 ) . as we discuss in subsequent sections , the late - time decline rates for sne  iin span a wide range , so there may be differences in the degree of circumstellar interaction among these sne .",

    "2002 ) investigated the late - time spectral evolution of sn 1995n from both ground - based and @xmath12 observations , and concluded that the late - time emission of sn 1995n is most likely powered by x - rays from the interaction of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium of the progenitor .",

    "compared to sn 1993j , sn 1996cb shows broader light curves , as well as earlier and stronger he  i emission ; thus , sn 1996cb may have thicker hydrogen and helium layers than sn 1993j in the outer ejecta .",

    "( 2001a ) .",

    "the change of decline rate at late times for sn 2000cx is most likely not due to light echoes , since sn 2000cx occurred at the outskirts of an early - type ( s0 ) galaxy , where a dusty environment is not expected .",
    "light echoes have been successfully detected around at least two sne  ia : sn 1991 t , after 600 days following maximum ( schmidt et  al .",

    "seven of the 12 sne recovered in our snapshot program are sne  iin and show slow evolution at late times . as discussed in previous sections , some differences among their late - time decline rates",
    "are found .",
    "this is to be expected because the subclass of sne  iin is known to span a very broad range of properties ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ; filippenko , li , & modjaz 1999 ) .",
    "some sne  iin are subluminous ( e.g. , sn 1997bs with @xmath69 mag , van dyk et  al .",
    "2000 ) , others are moderately bright ( e.g. , sn 1999eb with @xmath70 mag , assuming @xmath71 = 65 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) , while a few can rival the brightness of a sn  ia ( e.g. , sn 1998s with @xmath72 mag , leonard et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the light curves of all the sne  iin recovered in our snapshot program .",
    "even though the data are often limited by a large gap in time between the ground - based and the @xmath12 snapshot photometry , or by large time intervals between the snapshot observations , it is still easily seen from figure 6 that the light - curve shapes for the sne  iin are quite different : some decline monotonically after maximum ( e.g. , sn 1999eb in the @xmath0 band , and sn 1999eb in the @xmath20 band ) , while others experience multiple changes in their decline rate ( e.g. , sne 1997bs and 1998s in the @xmath0 band ) .",
    "there is no clear correlation between the light - curve shapes and the luminosities of the sne  iin : the overluminous sn 1998s and the subluminous sn 1997bs have similar narrow peaks , while the moderately bright sn 1999eb has a very broad peak .",
    "table 2 lists the late - time decline rates for some of the sne  iin , and it is clear that they span quite a large range .",
    "note , however , that these are sometimes derived at different evolutionary phases of the sne , so a close comparison should not be made .",
    "we suspect that the different light - curve shapes of sne  iin are closely related to their progenitor properties .",
    "relevant factors may be the density , structure , and radial distance of the circumstellar medium , the mass and composition of the progenitor , and so forth .",
    "the two vertical dotted lines in figure 6 mark one and two years after maximum light .",
    "it can be seen that the sne declined 0.3 to 7.3 mag in the @xmath0 band , and 0.3 to 6.2 mag in the @xmath20 band at one year after discovery , while they declined 0.6 to 8.5 mag in the @xmath0 band , and 0.8 to 8.3 mag in the @xmath20 band at two years after discovery .",
    "these numbers indicate that the template images for these sne  iin taken at one and two years after discovery will have different degrees of contamination from the sn light . for the extreme case of sn 1995n , which had declined only 0.6 mag in the @xmath0 band and 0.8 mag in the @xmath20 band by two years after discovery , the template images are seriously contaminated by the sn . while sn 1995n is at a fortunate location without a complicated background and the point - spread - function technique used to derive",
    "the photometry reported in ",
    "3.1 is adequate , other sne having similar behavior may not be so fortunate and it will take a very long time to obtain template images without significant contamination from the sn light .",
    "on the other hand , sn 1998s declined 7.3 mag in the @xmath0 band and 6.2 mag in the @xmath20 band by one year after discovery , which means the sn was only 0.30% and 0.33% of the peak @xmath0 and @xmath20-band brightness , respectively ; thus , the images taken one year after discovery will be good templates for those taken around maximum light .    we have well - defined late - time light curves for a few other sne in our sample . for sn ia 2000cx , we measured a decline of 9.0 mag in the @xmath28 band and 8.1 mag in the @xmath20 band by one year after discovery , which indicates that the late - time templates are not seriously contaminated by the sn light .",
    "for sn ii - p 1999gi , we measured a decline of 4.6 mag in the @xmath0 band by one year after discovery , when the sn was about 1.5% of its peak brightness .",
    "high - precision photometry of sne ii - p thus requires the template images to be taken at a time considerably later than one year after discovery .",
    "in this paper we present 12 sne recovered in the @xmath12 cycle 9 snapshot program go-8602 . @xmath12 photometry was obtained for the sne , and the data were tied to early - time ground - based observations , in order to study the late - time evolution of various types of sne .",
    "much of the ground - based data presented here are previously unpublished , and were obtained primarily with the katzman automatic imaging telescope .    the successful detection of sn 1996cb , a sn  iib , more than 4 years after discovery suggests the existence of interaction between the sn ejecta and the circumstellar medium .",
    "the peculiar sn  ic 1997ef , a  hypernova , \" is found to decline slowly between 100 and 1200 days after discovery .",
    "two bright sn ii - p discovered in 1999 , sne 1999gi and 1999gq , are also both recovered in the snapshot observations .",
    "we find that there is a diversity in the late - time evolution of sne  iin , perhaps due to differences in circumstellar interaction . some decline monotonically , such as sn 1999eb within the first 660 days following maximum brightness .",
    "others experience multiple changes in their decline rate , such as sne 1998s , 1999el , and 2000p .",
    "sn 1995n fades very slowly , declining by only 1.2 mag in @xmath0 over @xmath34 days following discovery .",
    "thus , template images of some sne must be obtained many years after the explosion , to minimize contamination from the sn itself .",
    "sn 1997bs , a subluminous sn  iin that was suggested by van dyk et  al.(2000 ) to be a superoutburst of a massive luminous blue variable , is only marginally detected in the f555w observations and not at all in the two f814w images , casting some doubt on the hypothesis that the progenitor survived the explosion .",
    "sn 1999bw , an object similar to sn 1997bs in terms of its spectrum and peak luminosity , showed a slower late - time decline rate than sn 1997bs .",
    "sn 2000cx is the only sn  ia recovered in the snapshot observations .",
    "both the @xmath28-band and @xmath20-band decline rates are found to decrease at late times , but we do not believe this is due to a light echo .",
