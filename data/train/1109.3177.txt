    "general relativity has been deemed as one of the cornerstones of modern theoretical physics .",
    "all its predictions , especially in the solar system regime , found numerous experimental evidences @xcite . despite the theory",
    "promises to completely clear up the dynamical properties of the whole universe , many attempts spent to explain those properties , at cosmological scales , failed to be predictive .",
    "the main flaw arose when in 1998 it was first discovered @xcite , that a late positive acceleration dominates the dynamics of the universe .",
    "this key feature was straight observed by the use of supernovae ia , as distance indicators and later confirmed by various experimental evidences @xcite ; however , it was also clear that if one takes into account only the baryonic and ( cold ) dark matter ( dm ) , as gravitational sources , gr does not predict an accelerated scenario , as expected according to observations .",
    "thus , it has been argued that a further new ingredient should be enclosed within the cosmological puzzle @xcite .",
    "its physical nature remains undiscovered and so , due to the lack of a self - consistent explanation of it , we refer to this missing counterpart as dark energy ( de ) , which might counterbalance the gravitational effects . moreover , quite surprisingly , observations spilled out definitively that about 70@xmath0 of the universe is filled by this unknown ingredient and in addition that about the 25@xmath0 is composed by dm . therefore , numerous approaches have followed one another , during the time , in order to elucidate the nature of these unknown components .    at a first glance , being as the likely simplest explanation of the acceleration , a cosmological constant term @xmath1 should characterize the form of de @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , its consequent model , namely @xmath1cdm , undergoes several theoretical issues , leading to the well known fine - tuning and coincidence problems @xcite . for overcoming these issues many alternatives to de",
    "have been proposed @xcite .    without going into details on the various frameworks propounded in literature , we focus on one intriguing task , which is represented by the so - called holographic principle ( hp ) @xcite .",
    "the basic idea lies on postulating that the maximum entropy inside a physical region is not extensive , since it grows as the area of the surface .    by extending this postulate to cosmology",
    ", it would be feasible to infer that the density of de , namely @xmath2 , should be proportional to an infrared ( ir ) cut - off scale , namely @xmath3 , and it can be rewritten as    @xmath4    the idea behind the cut - off scale is that a minimal information should exist and the consistent density associated to this minimal counterpart should be employed as an energy density .",
    "the latter one may be therefore included within the einstein s equations , in order to provide the positive acceleration .",
    "thereby , the problem of understanding the nature of de is shifted to the crucial issue of determining @xmath3 .",
    "an amusing loophole leads to the choice that a viable @xmath3 is that one , able to account both dm and de effects .",
    "many different cut - off scales have been examined during the last years @xcite . in particular , in a recent work it has been postulated that @xmath3 may be proportional to the root mean square of second order geometrical invariants @xcite .",
    "the choice of a geometrical ir cutoff has been demanded in order to work out the problem of causality , portrayed in @xcite , by allowing to solve it naturally , with only considering the form of space - time in the framework of gr .",
    "the physical purport of a geometrical choice of @xmath3 deals with the possibility that the geometry can be considered as a self - accelerated source , endowing a de term .",
    "the main intent of this paper is to testify that the hp , with the scale length proportional to curvature invariants , works fairly , providing encouraging results for attesting that it should be possible to regard to geometry as sources of de and predictable dm . as a first glance , then",
    ", our model can be considered as an unified paradigm for describing either the dynamical properties at cosmological scales or the presence of dm in the universe .",
    "the paper is then organized as follows ; in sec .",
    "2 we describe the theoretical features of our picture , in sec .",
    "3 we study and we extend the work of @xcite by performing cosmological tests on the model . sec .",
    "4 deals with the use of the so - called cosmography , as a tool for discriminating the kinematics of the universe , in the case of our approach . finally sec .",
    "5 develops the comparison of our proposal with the anisotropies of the cosmic power spectrum .",
    "6 is devoted to conclusions and perspectives .",
    "in this section , we investigate the consequences following from the assumption that an infrared cutoff exists that is proportional to the independent second order invariants .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we invoke the hp as a way to solve the de paradigm , by relating the second order curvature ( independent ) invariants to the de density , in the way    @xmath5    where with @xmath6 we express the generic invariant , while @xmath7 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the above equation is written in this form , since second order invariants are proportional to the inverse fourth power of the ir cutoff , then for dimensional requirements , we need the root mean square in the above form .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , among the 14 curvature scalar invariants , the most interesting ones are the kretschmann , chern - pontryagin and euler invariants .",
    "their forms are summarized as follows @xmath8_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ i_3 & = & [ { } ^*r{}^*]{}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the stars indicate the corresponding dual counterparts . from the first matt - decomposition of the weyl tensor ,",
    "it is easy to get @xcite @xmath9    therefore , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be expressed as follows @xcite @xmath13_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}c^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ i_3&=&-c_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}c^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}+2r_{\\alpha\\beta}r^{\\alpha\\beta}-\\frac{2}{3}r^2= \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -i_1 + 2r_{\\alpha\\beta}r^{\\alpha\\beta}-\\frac{2}{3}r^2\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above relations among invariants and tensors , one can get the explicit expressions of the second order invariants , once the space - time metric is known .",

    "the dimensionless density parameters of matter and the relativistic components are defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , where a index @xmath21 denotes that the quantity under examination is evaluated at @xmath22 , with the scale factor @xmath23 normalized to the unity today , _ @xmath24_.    we obtain for the invariants the following expressions    @xmath25    by inserting the expressions for @xmath10 and @xmath12 ( the only two nontrivial invariants ) into eq .",
    "( @xmath26 ) and by using the friedmann equation , we gain two differential equations , each one providing the temporal evolution of the hubble parameter . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will refer to the cosmological models arising from the invariants @xmath10 and @xmath12 as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "so , by keeping all these key features it will be possible in the next sections to perform various experimental bounds on our two models .",
    "particulary , what is following deals with the limits over their expansion history .",
    "in this section , we strengthen the robustness of the theoretical assumptions developed in sec .",
    "ii , by investigating the expansion history of the universe for our models .",
    "first of all , let us focus on the vacuum solutions of these models ; they refer to the settlement with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this limiting case is important in order to investigate the asymptotic behavior of our models .    for this limiting case we can analytically solve eq .",
    "( @xmath31 ) and it turns out that the holographic fluid behaves as a perfect fluid with constant barotropic factors @xmath32 for mod@xmath33 and mod@xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we can then choose the constant @xmath7 as @xmath35 so that @xmath36 for both models . clearly , these choices lead to a de sitter space - time as vacuum solutions and , as we will show below",
    ", they will be in excellent agreement with observations .    in order to analyze the behavior of our models in the presence of standard matter and radiation fields , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the corresponding eos for different values of @xmath17 and arbitrarily chosen values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .     for mod@xmath34 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "the double - dashed ( black ) line is the effective fluid of joint matter and radiation , @xmath44 .",
    "the horizontal lines show the asymptotic behaviors @xmath45 and @xmath46,width=326 ]    however , to obtain the results reported in fig .",
    "1 , it was necessary to choose for @xmath47 a value which is clearly lower than the value obtained by wmap 7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hp also appears as a source of the dm .",
    "we can perceive that , until the epoch of matter - radiation equality ( approximately at @xmath48 ) , the holographic fluid behaves as a relativistic component with @xmath49 , afterwards it behaves as a dustlike component , with @xmath50 , until it passes a redshift threshold ( @xmath51 ) and begins to follow the asymptotic value @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plotted the eos parameter of the joint matter and radiation fluids , defined as    @xmath53    we can see that at high redshifts the behavior of the holographic fluid resembles that of the source fields .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the effective eos parameter departs from @xmath54 before that of the matter - radiation fluid . as we shall see in sec . 5",
    ", this happens because the holographic fluids we consider are more likely to mimic matter fluids than relativistic ones .",
    "as first pointed out in the introduction , we suggest that both the de and dm counterparts may be explained by the choice of the ir cutoff scale ; so , to obtain a precise value for @xmath47 , we must perform a chi - squared fit with the supernovae union 2 data set @xcite and with the cmb shift parameter @xcite .",
    "the combined test is sufficient to predict a specific value which will be tested further in sec .",
    "v , where we will compare the predictions of our models with those of @xmath1cdm , by using cmb anisotropies .",
    "all the remaining parameters , such as the hubble constant , will be fixed by using the wmap 7 maximum likelihood @xcite .",
    "the application of the standard definition of the cmb shift @xcite @xmath55 presents some difficulties which can be overcome by using the alternative definition @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the position of the first peak on the cmb tt power spectrum of the model under consideration , and @xmath58 is the first peak in a flat frw universe with @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , for approaches providing a unified description of both de and dm , the latter expression must be used .    for any arbitrary model ,",
    "@xmath57 is defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the comoving angular distance at recombination , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 denotes the sound horizon at recombination @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the sound speed of the photon - to - baryon fluid , @xmath66 .    in the special case of @xmath1cdm",
    ", the shift parameter is simplified to ( [ cmbsod ] ) due to the fact that the cosmological constant s contribution to the hubble flow is negligible for @xmath67 , so that it can be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ shor ] ) . in general",
    "this approximation is not valid .",
    "this is the case of the models that are the subject of this work .",
    "for these models , indeed , at early times the holographic fluid mimics the whole background s fluids",
    ". therefore we will deal hereafter with the definition ( [ cmbshift ] ) .    the best value for the cmb shift parameter inferred from the wmap7yr analysis is given by @xmath68 on the other hand , for the supernovae ( sne ) fit we compare the distance modulus @xmath69 with the observational data of the union 2 data set which encompasses 557 supernovae up to the redshift @xmath701.7 , which represents the highest value .",

    "the quoted errors shows the @xmath74 confidence levels . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     it follows from the two tables that both models are compatible with the experimental limits offered by cosmography . indeed ,",
    "while @xmath27 excellently reproduces the experimental results , for @xmath28 the values of the cosmological parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 at @xmath22 , obtained for @xmath47 within the @xmath78 confidence interval , are not at the same agreement level as @xmath27 .",
    "an accurate look at the results shows that the goodness of @xmath28 remains disadvantaged , since it behaves worse than @xmath27 , which seems to appear more predictive , but it should not be ruled out definitively since the signs remain in the range of compatibility .",
    "notice that the goodness offered by the cosmographic test actually reflects the intriguing physical aspect relying on the fact that in a low redshift regime we should expect that @xmath27 behaves like the @xmath1cdm . in other words",
    ", we can expect that @xmath27 formerly reduces to a cosmological constant at small redshift more quickly than @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we describe the imprint of anisotropies into the cmb power spectrum , by adopting our models and we develop the growth of inhomogeneities for the matter sector as well .",
    "since our models do not provide any analytical expressions for the anisotropic equations , we are trying to map both @xmath27 and @xmath28 by finding a suitable approximation to the expansion history for them .",
    "the basic idea is to map both the models , by using the results obtained in sec .",
    "ii , in order to check if they work at higher redshifts as well .",
    "what we will immediately infer is that their behaviors suggest that the eos can be approximated by three separated pieces , a dark matter fluid , a relativistic fluid and a cosmological constant term .",
    "it turns out to be more accurate to perform this approximation , giving rise to an evolving eos , precisely we follow the standard chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite , which invokes as a barotropic factor the known expression @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we approximate the energy density of the holographic fluids ( @xmath2 ) as    @xmath80    here , the subscript @xmath81 stands for the _ holographic dm _ , mimicking the piece behaving as matter in the holographic eos , while @xmath82 analogously represents the relativistic part , which mimics the relativistic term as well as the matter .    for purposes of cmb analysis we must demand a good approximation at early times , before recombination .",
    "a failure in the approximation at late times will be reflected in the large scale multipole moments ( @xmath83 ) which are poorly constrained due to the cosmic variance .    for both models we adopt @xmath84 and @xmath73 @xcite and regarding @xmath47 , we assume the validity of the best fits given by sneia and cmb shift , found in sec .",
    "iii for each model .",

    "[ fig5 ] we plot the effective eos parameter of mod@xmath33 under our approximation .",
    "it is well emphasized that the differences are extremely small , giving rise to good results of the first model at higher redshift . in particular , they have been estimated to be less than @xmath91 , before recombination ( @xmath92 ) .    for mod@xmath34",
    "analogously we have found @xmath93 , @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath89 is again fixed by the requirement of spatially flat geometry like the above case .",
    "figure 9 shows the effective eos ( weff ) and the approximation based on the cpl parametrization . in this case , the differences are also small , being less than @xmath97 before recombination .",
    "it appears intriguing to note that these approximations are not valid for future redshift , i.e. @xmath98 ; they can not be extrapolated to the future .    figures .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig3 ] show the eos parameters of mod@xmath99 , respectively",
    ".    moreover , for both models the relativistic term behaves in the form @xmath100 , while for nonrelativistic matter we found @xmath101 .",
    "this definitively shows that the holographic models enhance the gravitational effects due to nonrelativistic fluids more than that of relativistic ones ; we are not surprised by this feature , since , though in different ways , we have already anticipated it in sec .",

    "in addition , there are large discrepancies in the first three peaks , but these have been inferred to be well inside the error bars , different from the rest . at low scales , those differences quickly decay ; this is as expected , because in the silk damped tail region the anisotropies are mainly due to the microphysics driven by the photon - baryon plasma which the holographic fluid is not able to modify ; indeed , the holographic fluids interact only gravitationally . in order to obtain the plots of figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , we have also fixed the amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbation @xmath103 , defined as the proportionally constant in the equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the primordial power spectrum of the gravitational potential @xmath106 , while @xmath107 , defined as the spectral index , is assumed to be @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where we moreover put an arbitrary pivotal scale @xmath110 in the above expression . for both holographic models and for @xmath1cdm , which is used for calibrating our tests , we adopted respectively @xmath111 .    on the other hand , we emphasize that fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the matter power spectrum of mod@xmath99 ; we found extremely small discrepancies between the three curves , where the third one is represented by @xmath1cdm .",
    "the larger differences are located about @xmath112 , leaving probable imprints in the baryon acoustic oscillations that could be potentially detected in near future experiments .",
    "nonetheless , currently these differences are not enough to discriminate between the @xmath1cdm model and one of our models .",
    "this confirms that there is no reason not to use against the use of curvature invariants as a tool for explaining both dm and de effects .",
    "in this work , we proposed as ir cutoff scale for the size @xmath3 , in the context of the cosmological hp , a second order geometrical approach , dealing with the use of independent invariants embedded in a frw background , as a source for both dm and de .",
    "in particular , the de density is assumed to be proportional to these invariants , which reduce from 14 to 3 in the frw cosmology ; thus , we use only gr and the hp to construct our models .",
    "moreover , we extended the work of @xcite and we safely overcame the problem of causality , portrayed in @xcite , which represents one of the most serious shortcomings of the choice of the ir cutoff .",
    "one of the main benefit of our approaches is basically due to the advantage of characterizing the acceleration of the universe , by geometrical considerations only , by pointing out that the geometry is capable to describe the positive acceleration .    particularly , we found two viable models ( the third one is trivial , corresponding to the dustlike case only ) , and we developed a series of cosmological tests , able to explain their robustness . therefore , the expansion history definitively fixed the values of @xmath47 and @xmath7 , the free parameters of our approaches , which have been described through the use of sneia and cmb tests .",
    "moreover , as a powerful analysis , we investigated cosmography in the framework of our models , since it has been testified an amusing interest on the universe s kinematics ; the predictions of cosmography certified that @xmath27 is favored if compared to @xmath28 , as it has been pointed in sec .",
    "we also arrived at analogous results in the last sections , with higher redshift tests .",
    "in fact , additional confirmation came from the direct study of the anisotropy of the power spectrum and then , after all , we conclude that our models can be pondered as possible sources of both de and dm , becoming a viable candidate to explain unified schemes for the universe s dynamics ; in particular , such a picture seems to be able to naturally reduce the problem of the dm presence in the universe , in the framework of gr , being able to explain , at the same time , the cosmic speed up .",
    "more considerations can be carried forward this idea , in order to check if , trough higher order invariants , it would be possible to definitively overcome the problem of dm and de .",
