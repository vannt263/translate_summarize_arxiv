    "the lhcb detector@xcite is a single - arm forward spectrometer designed for the study of heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "many results have been published by the lhcb collaboration , in particular on cp violation in decays of @xmath2 and @xmath3 hadrons .",
    "in contrast , until recently lhcb had made no measurements on cpt violation in these decays . in these proceedings , a new result@xcite from the lhcb collaboration on cpt violation in @xmath0 mixing and @xmath1 mixing is highlighted .",
    "violation of cpt symmetry implies a breaking of lorentz invariance in a local , interacting quantum field theory.@xcite this means that any cpt - violating parameter must also violate lorentz invariance . the standard - model extension ( sme )",
    "is an effective field theory , where cpt- and lorentz - violating terms are added to the standard - model lagrangian.@xcite this framework provides the experimental opportunity to measure the coupling coefficients in these terms .",
    "the lhcb result@xcite presented here is given in terms of these sme coefficients .",
    "in the past , there have been many experimental searches for cpt violation in neutral - meson systems.@xcite the majority of these searches have been done without any assumption on the breaking of lorentz invariance , referred to as the classical approach . in the last 15 years , more searches have been performed within the sme framework , placing tight constraints on its coefficients.@xcite",
    "the particle - antiparticle mixing between neutral - meson states creates an interferometric system that enhances the sensitivity to cpt violation enormously .",
    "conservation of cpt symmetry implies equal mass and lifetime of particles and antiparticles .",
    "the cpt - violating observable in the mixing process is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ( cpt - violating ) mass and decay width differences between the particle and antiparticle states .",
    "the high sensitivity to @xmath7 comes through the small values in the denominator of the eigenvalue differences , @xmath8and @xmath9 , of the two - state system . in the sme framework ,",
    "the @xmath7 observable becomes@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the four velocity of the neutral meson and is a real four - vector vacuum expectation value that describes the coupling with the mesons .",
    "the complex parameter @xmath7 can be determined directly from the decay rates as function of the decay time of the neutral meson.@xcite    there are four systems of neutral mesons . in all of them ,",
    "the mixing formalism is identical , however , their phenomenology is very different owing to the different values of @xmath8and @xmath9 , and number of decay modes . in the @xmath12 system",
    ", there have been many searches for cpt violation by dedicated kaon experiments ( kloe , ktev , cplear , and na48 ) following the classical approach .",
    "an experimental overview is given in ref .  .",
    "strong constraints on the sme coefficients have been made using data from kloe , ktev and e773.@xcite it will be difficult for lhcb to compete with these dedicated kaon experiments due to the lower statistics and worse kaon lifetime acceptance .",
    "the situation is already different in the @xmath13 system . only a single measurement exists , by the focus collaboration,@xcite using a sample of 35k @xmath14 decays .",
    "lhcb would be able to improve this measurement significantly owing to the 50 m @xmath14 decays , collected during run 1.@xcite in the following , i will focus on the two remaining neutral - meson systems : the and systems .",
    "in both the system and system , @xmath9is negligibly small compared to @xmath8 .",
    "the standard model predicts that @xmath9is about a factor 200 smaller than @xmath8,@xcite which is already confirmed in the system . since is real , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) that @xmath15is a factor 400 smaller than @xmath16 . therefore , to constrain the sme coefficients , decays to cp eigenstates are used , which are more sensitive to @xmath16 in comparison to using decays to flavor - specific final states.@xcite the golden decay modes to cp eigenstates , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , have been used due to their relatively large branching fraction .",
    "these modes have been studied already at lhcb to measure @xmath19 and @xmath20.@xcite for the present analysis , the fit models have been extended to allow for possible cpt violation.@xcite the results@xcite are shown in table [ tab : cptresults ] .",
    "no significant sidereal variation and no violation of cpt symmetry are observed . in the system",
    ", there is a large improvement of three orders of magnitude with respect to the previous best result@xcite from babar . in the system",
    ", there is an order of magnitude improvement with respect to the previous best result@xcite from .",
    "the improvements are primarily attributed to the large boost of the mesons at lhcb ( i.e. , @xmath21 versus @xmath22 at babar and @xmath23 at ) .",
    "[ tab : cptresults ]",
    "in summary , interferometry with neutral mesons provides a sensitive method to test violations of cpt symmetry and lorentz invariance . the lhcb experiment is well suited to improve the sme bounds , in particular due to the high boost of the particles produced at the lhc .",
    "there are plans to measure @xmath7 and in the system , which aim to improve the current bounds by a factor 40 . as highlighted in these proceedings ,",
    "greatly improved limits on cpt violation and lorentz symmetry breaking in mixing have been published by lhcb.@xcite these results are based on an integrated luminosity of 3obtained in run 1 of the lhc . at the end of run 2 in 2019 , an expected @xmath24-@xmath25 will be added . due to the larger cross sections at the new center - of - mass energy of 13@xmath26 , the heavy flavor yields are almost a factor two higher in run 2 .",
    "furthermore , the meson boost will also be about 30% higher .",
    "together this means that the uncertainties will reduce by a factor two .",
    "a further improvement can be expected from the upgraded lhcb detector that will start data taking after 2019 : with a projected 50the uncertainties will drop by more than a factor of six .",
