    "the liquid - like quark matter observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite has inspired a renaissance in hydrodynamic modeling at high energy .",

    ". viscous effects , or equivalently the effects of non - equilibrium values of the spatial components of the stress - energy tensor @xmath0 , are especially important during the first few fm/@xmath1 of the collision which is characterized by large velocity gradients and enormous shears .",
    "bulk viscosity might play an important role during the hadronization stage , arising from the matter s inability to maintain equilibrium when traversing the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the standard means for implementing viscous effects into hydrodynamics is the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations @xcite .",

    "is treatments the components are treated as dynamic objects which decay exponentially towards the ns values . in this paper",
    "the is equations are analyzed in detail , the differences between is and ns descriptions are explored , and the degree to which the additional parameters required for is theory might be microscopically calculable from approaches like lattice gauge theory is investigated . after reviewing the basic motivations and premises of is - based equations in this section , the formulations are analyzed from the perspectives of entropy growth and linear response theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : entropy ] .",
    "these perspectives constrain both the form and parameters of is theory .",
    "in particular , the relaxation times , along with the viscosities , are shown to determine both the functional form for the relaxation and the statistical fluctuation of the elements of the stress - energy tensor .",

    "the pressure @xmath4 , the shear viscosity @xmath5 , and the bulk viscosity @xmath6 are all functions of the energy and particle densities , though we will ignore the particle - density dependence throughout the remainder of the paper .",
    "since the stress - energy tensor is symmetric , the deviation of @xmath0 from the equilibrium value @xmath7 can be expressed in terms of six independent numbers : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 refers to the deviation from equilibrium of the trace of @xmath0 and is related to the bulk viscosity , while the five values @xmath10 , which are related to the shear viscosity , describe the angular anisotropy .",
    "in addition to @xmath11 one can also define five symmetrized `` velocity gradients '' , @xmath12 with these definitions , the work ( in the local rest frame ) due to expanding a volume @xmath13 for a time increment @xmath14 becomes , @xmath15,\\ ] ] and the navier - stokes equations assume a simple form , @xmath16    israel - stewart approaches @xcite differ from ns in that @xmath10 and @xmath9 are treated as dynamical objects .",
    "originally , the motivation for is approaches was related to their numerical stability compared to ns equations @xcite .",
    "this property follows from the fact that the equations are hyperbolic , as opposed to ns equations which are parabolic , similar to the diffusion equation .",
    "since the diffusion current can move arbitrarily quickly for arbitrarily large gradients , the equations were effectively non - causal . though the violation of causality was never shown to be important in the context of rhic collisions ,",
    "is solutions have been considered safer than ns solutions .",
    "an analysis of the stability of sonic modes of a given wavelength is presented in section [ sec : sonic ] .",
    "the basic premise of is solutions is that the offsets of @xmath0 decay toward their ns values exponentially , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of the energy density .",
    "they are usually set to unity , and if the energy density is fixed , the forms for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are irrelevant . providing an energy dependence to @xmath18 and @xmath19 change the equations of motion for large velocity gradients . for instance , with a large velocity gradient a system will expand by a given fraction in a time inversely proportional to the velocity gradients . if the expansion time is much less than the relaxation times @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be effectively frozen for very rapid expansions . as an example ,",
    "if @xmath18 were set equal to @xmath4 , a very rapid expansion would freeze the ratios @xmath24 , whereas setting @xmath25 would lead to a freezing out of the variation from equilibrium @xmath10 . for a rapidly cooling system where @xmath4 is rapidly falling",
    ", the choice of @xmath26 might keep the components of @xmath0 positive , whereas the choice @xmath25 might lead to negative elements .    as an aside",

    "however , that term is explicitly zero in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "if one were solving the equations of motion for @xmath30 , one would need to rotate the stress energy tensor at every time step consistently with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotation ] ) .",
    "this would mix the five elements @xmath10 , but would leave @xmath9 unchanged . since @xmath31 is proportional to velocity gradients , and since @xmath10 is also proportional to viscosity gradients in ns theory , corrections for rotational flow are considered a `` second - order '' correction from the ns perspective .",
    "thus , one expects rotational effects to be negligible except for those instances where there exists both rotation and significant values for the anisotropies @xmath10 . henceforth , we will neglect rotation , though we emphasize that it might become non - negligible for non - central collisions , or for flow away from mid - rapidity .",
    "the parameters of is hydrodynamics are the viscosities , @xmath5 and @xmath32 , the relaxation times , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the scaling functions for the exponential decays , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "each of these six parameters can be functions of the energy density .",
    "however , as will be seen in the next section , the constraint that the entropy can not fall constrains the number of parameters to four , and relates them to the statistical fluctuations of @xmath0 .",
    "entropy must rise , and since the is equations describe entropy production , the is parameters are constrained .",
    "furthermore , the entropy should depend not only on the energy density , but also on the deviation of @xmath0 from equilibrium . in this section",
    "we will show how the entropy constraint reduces the number of is parameter from six to four , and relates them to the statistical fluctuation of @xmath0 , which in turn is related to how the entropy is affected by non - zero values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .    for a fixed energy density , @xmath0 should equal @xmath4 if the entropy is maximized . for small variations , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , the entropy penalty will grow quadratically with @xmath33 and @xmath9 .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of the energy and can change arbitarily quickly for arbitrarily rapid expansions , ensuring that the entropy always rises requires stating that both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants , which can be set to unity without changing any behavior , @xmath55 if the terms linear in @xmath33 and @xmath9 are to never contribute to the entropy regardless of the values of @xmath33 and @xmath9 , @xmath56 thus , the viscosities and relaxation times uniquely determine the scaling functions for the exponential decays , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are equivalent to the fluctuations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 at fixed energy . this latter expression was derived from the perspective of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "this derivation is both more general , and provides the equivalence between the fluctuations and the scaling functions .",
    "after the parameter constraints are enforced , the growth rate for the entropy has a simple form , @xmath57 after enforcing the ns equations in eq .",

    "the time required for the dimensions of the volume to increase by a specific amount will be proportional to @xmath60 or @xmath61 . considering a time step , @xmath62 a fluid element will increase by a factor , @xmath63 for a small @xmath64 , the equations of motion for @xmath65 and @xmath66 in eq .",

    "thus , in the limit of infinitely fast velocity gradients , the net entropy production approaches a fixed value depending on @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast , the ns production rate is proportional to the velocity gradients squared , so that the net entropy produced for a fixed expansion factor @xmath64 is divergent as @xmath68 . for the opposite extreme , of a small velocity gradient , the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eq .",

    "this should be true for either large temperatures or long relaxation times , i.e. , @xmath258 .",
    "the former expression is satisfied by all three forms in table [ table : parameters ] as @xmath259 .",
    "one way to check the validity of the classical limit is to compare @xmath260 to @xmath183 , both of which are calculable on the lattice .",

    "thus given the same values @xmath183 and @xmath199 from the lattice , the two forms would lead to viscosities that differ by nearly a factor of two .",
    "the breit - wigner form can vary even more , since the addition of a third parameter makes @xmath5 under - constrained if one uses only @xmath183 and @xmath199 .",
    "physically , the oscillatory nature of the breit - wigner form makes the moments less predictable , and underscores the importance of selecting a non - oscillatory functional form if there is physical justification .",
    "of course , the hermite expansion can mimic oscillatory behavior of @xmath160 if given a sufficient number of terms .",
    "one feature of all three functional forms described above is that they can accommodate arbitrarily short relaxation times . in some of the arguments used to motivate the kss limit , @xmath266 @xcite",

    "this constraint is easily violated by all three functional forms considered here .",
    "the considerations presented here all seem to solidify israel - stewart approaches as the preferred approach for hydrodynamic descriptions of high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "israel - stewart treatments are more numerically stable and physical .",
    "although the treatments require additional parameters , they are uniquely determined by the microscopic properties of the medium , which are formally stated in a way that can be addressed in sophisticated approaches like lattice gauge theory .",
    "israel - stewart parameters are only uniquely determined for small deviations from equilibrium , even if the velocity gradients are large , but treatments can be phenomenologically extended to describe large deviations by adding extra parameters to confine the magnitude of the deviation of the stress - energy tensor to physical values .    since lattice calculations do not directly explore thermal expectations of operators evaluated at real times , neither the viscosities or relaxation times are directly accessible",
    ". however , the ratios of the viscous parameters to the relaxation times , which correspond to equal - time thermal fluctuations of the stress - energy tensor , can be explicitly determined . extracting the viscosities",
    "requires fitting the behavior of the thermal correlators , which can be directly determined for imaginary times , @xmath148 , to a chosen functional form , which is then analytically continued to real times .",
    "the only firm lessons to be learned from the comparison of the three functional forms investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : pathintegrals ] is that the choice of form can significantly affect the answer , and that the choice of form should depend on whether one expects oscillatory behavior , and whether the classical approximation ( long relaxation times compared to the inverse temperature ) is justified .",
