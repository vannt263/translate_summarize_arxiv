    "interference channel problem describes a setup where multiple pairs of transmitters and receivers share a communication medium . each receiver is only interested in decoding the message from its corresponding transmitter .",
    "however , since the channel is shared , signals from other senders interfere with the desired signal at each decoder .",
    "the presence of interfering signals adds new dimensions to this problem in terms of strategies that can be used as compared to point - to - point ( ptp ) communication .",
    "for example , the encoders can _ cooperate _ with each other by choosing their channel inputs in a way that would facilitate their joint communication .",
    "it turns out that , often , this cooperation requires an encoder to employ a strategy which may be sub - optimal from its own ptp communications perspective . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this tradeoff and develop a new class of codes which allow for more efficient cooperation between the transmitters .    characterizing the capacity region for the general ic",
    "has been a challenge for decades . even in the simplest case of the two user ic , the capacity region",
    "is only known in special cases @xcite@xcite .",
    "the best known achievable region for the ic was due to han and kobayashi @xcite .",
    "however , recently it was shown that the han - kobayashi ( hk ) rate region is suboptimal @xcite@xcite .",
    "particularly , when there are more than two transmitter - receiver pairs , the natural generalization of the hk strategy can be improved upon by inducing structure in the codebooks used in the scheme @xcite .",
    "structured codes such as linear codes and group codes enable the encoders to align their signals more efficiently .",
    "this in turn reduces interference at the decoders .",
    "such codebook structures have also proven to give gains in other multi - terminal communication problems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the idea of interference alignment was proposed for managing interference when there are three or more users .",
    "initially , the technique was proposed by maddah - ali et .",
    "@xcite for the mimo x channel , and for the multi - user ic by jafar and cadambe @xcite .",
    "the interference alignment strategy was developed for cases of additive interference and uniform channel inputs over finite fields .",
    "this was extended to arbitrary interference settings and input distributions in @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that alignment is not always beneficial to the users in terms of achievable rates .",
    "consider the example in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "intuitively , it would be beneficial to align the input from users 1 and 2 to reduce interference at decoder 3 .",
    "however , if users 1 and 2 align their signals , it becomes harder for decoder 2 to distinguish between the two inputs .",
    "one might suggest that the problem could be alleviated if users 1 and 2 designed their codebooks in a way that they would `` look '' aligned at decoder 3 based on @xmath0 , but at the same time they would seem different at decoder 2 based on @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we show that linear codes lack the necessary flexibility for such a strategy . based on this intuition",
    ", we propose a new class of structured codes .",
    "using these codes we derive an achievable rate region which improves upon the best known achievable region for the three user ic given in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : not ] gives the notation used in the paper as well as the problem statement . in section [ sec : trade ] , we consider two different examples of three user ic . in the first example - where interference alignment is strictly beneficial",
    "- we prove that not only structured codes are useful for alignment but that any arbitrary coding scheme which achieves optimality must possess certain linearity properties . in the second example , we show the existence of the tradeoff discussed above and prove that linear codes are suboptimal for that example .",
    "section [ sec : code ] , gives the new codebook constructions and proves that these new codes outperform the linear coding scheme in @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : rr ] , we provide a new general achievable rate region for this problem .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] , concludes the paper .",

    "we denote the outer rates as @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the inner rate @xmath58 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the interference alignment tradeoff mentioned in the introduction in more detail .",
    "we show that in certain three user interference setups , on the one hand , alignment is beneficial to one of the users , while on the other hand , the rates achieved by the aligning users is reduced due to the alignment .",
    "we investigate the phenomenon in two examples .",
    "the first example involves a three user interference setup . in this example , the first two encoders use linear codes to manage the interference for the third user .",
    "this gives a strictly improved achievable rate region .",
    "it is well - known that interference alignment can be induced efficiently by the application of structured codes .",
    "additional to this , we show the stronger statement that the only ensemble of codes which achieve the desired rate - triples in this example , are the ones with specific linearity properties .",
    "next , we build upon the first example to create a setup where alignment is beneficial to one of the users and harmful for the other one .",
    "this second example provides the motivation for our new codebook constructions in the next section .",
    "consider the example shown in figure [ fig : goodalignment ] .",
    "all of the inputs are @xmath7-ary and the additions are defined on the field @xmath8 .",
    "the three outputs of the channel are @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "we are interested in achieving the following rates for the first and second users :        @xmath61 given these rates , we want to maximize @xmath62 .",
    "the following lemma shows that linear codes achieve the optimum @xmath62 for this setup .",
    "furthermore , we show that if an ensemble of codes achieves the optimum @xmath62 , then the codes corresponding to the first two users are `` almost '' the same coset code .",

    "we provide an outline of the proof in appendix [ app : eg1 ] .",
    "the lemma proves that even if we expand our search to arbitrary @xmath17-length codebook constructions ( as opposed to the usual random codebook generation based on single - letter distributions ) , coset codes are the only efficient ensemble of codes for the classes of interference channels under consideration up to small perturbations .",
    "this is a stronger assertion than the well - known result that linear codes are useful for aligning the interfering signals .",
    "the lemma can be used to provide a converse result proving that schemes involving random unstructured codes ( e.g. the generalized version of the single - letter hk scheme ) , ca nt achieve the desired rate - triple without directly analyzing the bounds corresponding to their achievable rate region as done in @xcite .",
    "next , we consider an example where interference alignment results in a tradeoff between two of the users .",
    "consider the setup in figure [ fig : eg2 ] .",
    "similar to the previous example , all input alphabets , output alphabets , and additions are defined on the field @xmath8 .",
    "the outputs of the channel are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . following our arguments in the previous example , for user 3 to be able to transmit its messages at rate @xmath77 , the inputs for users @xmath78 and @xmath79 must align . however , if these two users align their inputs , user 2 would not be able to decode its message which is being corrupted by its aligned interfering signal coming from user 1 .",
    "hence , we have a tradeoff .",
    "we proceed with evaluating the rate - triples achievable in this example .",
    "the following lemma proves that we must have @xmath80 , otherwise the rate - triple @xmath35 is not achievable .",
    "[ lem : lem2 ] given that @xmath35 is achievable , we must have @xmath81 .    since the rate triple is achievable",

    "assuming errorless decoding at decoder 2 , the decoder has access to @xmath83 .",
    "the decoder can subtract @xmath84 from @xmath85 to get @xmath86 .",
    "now , since by assumption decoder 1 can decode @xmath87 from @xmath88 with error going to 0 , decoder 2 can use @xmath86 to recover @xmath87 with small error .",
    "so decoder 2 has access to @xmath89 and @xmath90 . by the converse of the point - to - point channel coding theorem , we must have @xmath91 , which completes the proof .",
    "we want to achieve the rate @xmath92 . in other words ,",
    "encoder 1 is to operate at ptp optimality .",
    "the goal is to optimize the linear combination @xmath93 .",
    "we argue that the linear coding scheme presented in @xcite ca nt achieve the triple @xmath35 for @xmath94 .",
    "[ lem : lem3 ] given @xmath95 , the scheme in @xcite ca nt achieve @xmath94 .",
    "we provide the intuition behind the proof here .",
    "let us use two ncl s @xmath96 and @xmath97 as defined in definition [ def : pnlc ] to transmit the messages at encoders 1 and 2 .",
    "let the rate of @xmath98 be @xmath99 and let the inner code have rate @xmath100 .",
    "if we assume that the coding scheme exists which achieves the rate - triple , then by the proof of lemma [ lem : lem2 ] , one should be able to recover @xmath101 from @xmath102 with small error probability .",
    "also , at decoder @xmath64 , the decoder can reconstruct @xmath103 with low error probability and by subtraction it can have @xmath104 .",
    "note that in the linear coding scheme , both @xmath105 and @xmath106 come from randomly and uniformly generated linear codes of rate @xmath107 .",
    "so , given that @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be recovered from @xmath102 , decoder 3 must be able to recover @xmath108 and @xmath109 from @xmath104 .",
    "then similar to the proof of lemma [ lem : eg1 ] , by the point - to - point channel coding converse , we must have @xmath110 .",
    "the arguments in the proof of the previous lemma suggest that nlc s lack the necessary flexibility when it comes to determining the size of different linear combinations of such codes .",
    "we explain this in more detail . consider two nlc s , @xmath41 and @xmath111 , with rates @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , and with inner code rate @xmath100 .",
    "the rate of any linear combination of the two , @xmath114 , is equal to @xmath115 .",
    "whereas in settings such as the one at hand , it is desirable to have different rates for different values of @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in this setup ,",
    "decoder 2 requires @xmath118 to be large ( since by lemma [ lem : lem2 ] in order to increase @xmath119 it needs to increase the rate of this linear combination ) and decoder 3 wants the size of the interfering codebook @xmath120 to be small , so that it can decode the interference . in the next section , we provide a new class of codes . the new construction allows for different rates for different linear combinations of such codes",
    "this in turn results in higher achievable sum - rates .",
    "in this section , we present our new coding constructions .",
    "these new codes are called quasi linear codes ( qlc ) . they are not linearly closed but maintain a degree of linearity . in order to construct a qlc , we first construct a linear code . then , we take a subset of that codebook to transmit the messages .",

    "we only consider the cases when @xmath5 is a cartesian product of typical sets : @xmath123}\\mathbf{u}_ig_i\\oplus \\mathbf{b}|\\mathbf{u}_i\\in a_{\\epsilon}^{k_i}(u_i)\\}.\\ ] ] a pair of nested quasi linear codes ( nqlc ) is defined below :    [ def : pqlc ] for natural numbers @xmath124 , let @xmath125 $ ] be matrices , and @xmath126 dithers all defined on @xmath8 . also , let @xmath127 and @xmath128 be a pair of random vectors on @xmath8 .",
    "the pair of qlc s characterized by the matrices @xmath125 $ ] and each of the two dithers and vectors of random variables are called a pair of nqlc s .    as explained in the previous section ,",
    "our motivation for defining nqlc s , is to construct codes such that different linear combinations of those codes have different rates .",
    "the next lemma shows that nqlc s have this property .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath111 be two qlc s as defined in definition [ def : pqlc ] , whose generator matrices and dithers are taken randomly and uniformly from @xmath8 . then , @xmath129 has rate close to @xmath130}\\frac{k_i}{n}h(\\alpha u_i\\oplus \\beta u'_i)$ ] for large @xmath17 with high probability .",
    "the proof follows from the injectiveness of the @xmath131 s and the usual typicality arguments and is omitted .",
    "having defined qlc s , we return to our interference channel setup in example 2 .",
    "we claim that nqlc s can achieve a sum - rate @xmath93 which is higher than @xmath132 .",
    "[ lem : newrate ] there exists achievable rate - triples @xmath133 such that @xmath134 .",

    "so , any rate region achievable by nlc s is also achievable using nqlc s .",
    "in this section , we provide a general achievable rate region for the three user ic .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of coding over the multi - user interference channel ( ic ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that aligning the interfering signals results in improved achievable rates in certain setups involving more than two users . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in the general interference problem , senders face a tradeoff between communicating their message to their corresponding decoder or cooperating with other users by aligning their signals . traditionally , interference alignment is carried out using structured codes such as linear codes and group codes . </S>",
    "<S> we show through an example that the usual structured coding schemes used for interference neutralization lack the necessary flexibility to optimize this tradeoff . based on this intuition </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a new class of codes for this problem . </S>",
    "<S> we use the example to show that the application of these codes gives strict improvements in terms of achievable rates . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derive a new achievable region for the three user ic which strictly improves upon the previously known inner bounds for this problem . </S>"
