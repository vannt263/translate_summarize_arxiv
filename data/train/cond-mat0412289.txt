    "electron transmission in quantum wires with various geometric structures has been an interesting area of research in mesoscopic physics in recent times @xcite . apart from presenting an interesting problem in itself",
    ", this area of research has profound implications in applied physics and materials science , particularly , in designing nano - devices with exotic electronic properties .",
    ".2 in nano - technology , as its present advanced stage , makes it possible to fabricate a variety of quantum structures such as quantum dots , wires and rings .",
    "the surface of solids can be designed with appreciable control to serve as ideal templates for the formation of low - dimensional nano - structures with desired geometry @xcite .",
    "nano - devices such as one - dimensional wires can be experimentally prepared by controlling self - organized defects at the surface @xcite .",
    "apart from the path - breaking experiments , from the point of view of a theoretician , an interesting observation is that , often the basic principle underlying the operation of these fabricated nano - systems can be modeled in a quite simple manner , using quantum mechanics and elementary solid state physics .",
    "one such example is the study of electron transport in model quantum wires with dangling side branches ( stubs ) @xcite of finite length .",
    "such ` dangling ' stubs can be grafted along a nano - wire with any specified ordering .",
    "the presence of stubs in a quantum wire has been shown to lead to transistor action by sols et al @xcite .",
    "the length of the stubs can be controlled by applying a gate voltage , and a change in these lengths result in a non - trivial change in the spectrum of the system @xcite .",
    "the spectrum and band structure of an array of stubs were studied by deo and jayannavar @xcite as well .",
    "they pointed out that , unlike a system of potential scatterers , a system of geometrical scatterers ( such as an array of stubs ) exhibit complete band formation in the conductance with only a few such stubs .",
    "several studies on the quantum waveguide transport using model stubbed nano - wires then followed . shi and gu @xcite examined the electronic conductance of a quantum waveguide with side - branches taking into account the impedance factors for geometric and potential scatterers .",
    "vasseur et al @xcite studied simple tight binding models of one dimensional comb structures of simple metals . in a similar spirit pouthier and girardet @xcite",
    "have investigated the conductance of a monatomic nano - wire containing a random distribution of side - grafted nano - clusters of atoms .",
    "cervero and rodriguez @xcite modeled a quantum wire by a random array of delta potentials and extended their work to investigate the effect of positionally correlated potentials on the spectral behaviour .",
    "orellana et al @xcite stuck to the tight binging model to investigate the electronic transport through a quantum wire with a side quantum dot array .",
    "quite recently , cao et al @xcite have studied the electronic transport in a comb structure with a mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux .",
    "while the schrdinger equation approach @xcite is a natural choice for the calculation of the conductance , discrete difference equation approach @xcite also finds its justification by the recent advancement in atom manipulation technology in which one can place individual atoms on the substrate by using a scanning tunnel microscope tip as tweezers @xcite .",
    ".2 in though the transmission characteristics of a stubbed quantum wire are quite sensitive to the geometry of the structure , little effort has been given to study the spectral characteristics when the arrangement of the stubs deviates from being periodic .",
    "one interesting area , where in - depth studies in this regard are really lacking is , when the stubs are arranged in a hierarchical pattern . in this communication",
    "we undertake a detailed study of the electronic states and transport in a model one - dimensional quantum wire with stubs of finite length grafted on it following a triadic cantor sequence ( a one - dimensional fractal ) @xcite .",
    "apart from providing direct experimental evidence for localized and self - similar fracton mode displacements @xcite , interesting theoretical results indicate the presence of multiple fracton and phonon regimes in a triadic cantor sequence @xcite .",
    "also , the cantor distribution of dielectric layers has recently found application in the design of guided - wave optical or microwave filters @xcite .",
    "comparatively speaking , the electronic properties of a cantor quantum waveguide network is unattended so far , though recent tight binding results on the electronic properties of a cantor lattice with point scatterers indicate exotic features @xcite , being markedly different in several aspects from the conventional quasi - periodic lattices of the fibonacci class @xcite . in the case of a stubbed waveguide network",
    "the possibility of tuning the stub - lengths experimentally may provide an opportunity for practically ` seeing ' some of the peculiar features already encountered in the theoretical studies of such cantor - like substitutional sequences @xcite .",
    ".2 in with this motivation we undertake a detailed analysis of electronic transmission and the nature of wave - function in a cantor stub waveguide ( csw ) network using the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) and the transfer matrix ( tm ) method .",
    "we discretize the schrdinger equation to map the original sequence of stubs onto an equivalent one - dimensional chain consisting of point - like scatterers placed at the nodes where a stub meets the backbone .",
    "this facilitates the application of rsrg method . using rsrg with tm method we unravel a family of extended ( resonant ) eigenstates even through the underlying lattice lacks translational order .",
    "it is not unusual that , by controlling the length of a stub appropriately one can have an infinite number of wave - vectors of the propagating electron which fall in the spectral gaps of an infinite csw .",
    "however , a very interesting feature of a csw array is that , the same wave - vectors correspond to perfectly allowed ( in some cases , even periodic ) wave - functions for a csw of arbitrarily large , but finite length clamped between semi - infinite ordered leads .",
    "the most remarkable character of such states is that , the nearest neighbour hopping integral on the mapped lattice [ fig.1(b ) ] exhibit a two - cycle fixed point under rsrg operation , indicating an ` extended ' character ( in the rsrg sense ) , and yet the transmission coefficient of the ` lead - sample - lead ' system decays following a power law , as the sample grows in size .",
    "we term such states as ` atypically extended ' .",
    "this result is in total contrast to recent studies on a fibonacci quantum waveguide network @xcite .",
    ".2 in in what follows we describe our work . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and the method , section iii consists of a discussion of the overall transmission characteristics with an emphasis on the resonant eigenstates and in section iv we talk about the ` atypical ' eigenfunctions and the possibility of the trapping an excitation in such a quantum waveguide network . in section",
    "v we draw conclusion .",
    "( a ) second generation cantor array of quantum stub clamped in between two semi - infinite leads .",
    "( b ) the equivalent one - dimensional chain . ]",
    "a triadic cantor sequence is a binary arrangement of two elements , @xmath0 and @xmath1 for example @xcite .",
    "the sequence grows in a recursive manner , starting with a seed @xmath0 , using a substitution rule , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the first few generations are , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and so on .",
    "it is to be noted that such a sequence differs from conventional binary quasi - periodic sequence @xcite in the sense that , in the thermodynamic limit the sub - clusters of @xmath1 will span the entire one - dimensional space with the elements @xmath0 acting as impurities located at specific sites determined by the sequence .",
    ".2 in we model our system by attaching a series of stubs perpendicularly to a one dimensional wire .",
    "stubs of lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 are arranged in a cantor sequence with inter - stub spacings @xmath9 and @xmath10 as shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "we consider an electron entering the system from one side of the nano - wire with wave - vector @xmath11 .",
    "the wave - function in the @xmath12th segment ( chosen to be the segment between the @xmath12th and the @xmath13th stubs along the @xmath14-direction ) is given by , @xmath15 the wave - function in the @xmath12th stub ( along the @xmath16-direction ) is written as , @xmath17 the above equations are written using a local coordinate system in the spirit of ref .",
    "it is then simple to match the wave - functions and their derivatives at the nodes to arrive at the matrix equation : @xmath18 where , @xmath19 instead of dealing with the matrices @xmath20 we discretize eq.(3 ) into a set of difference equation much in the spirit of poincare mapping [ j. b. sokoloff , in ref .",
    "the resulting set of equations assume a rather simple form , @xmath21 where , @xmath22 is the amplitude of the wave function at the node @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to deal with the problem in the same manner as we do for a tight binding electron of energy @xmath23 moving in a one dimensional lattice with on - site potential @xmath24 for the @xmath12th site and the nearest neighbour hopping integrals @xmath25 . in our case",
    "the quantity @xmath26 assumes three different values depending on the nearest neighbour environment .",
    "the values are , @xmath27 the nearest neighbour hopping integrals on the mapped lattice are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 across the lengths @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "( 15 ) is easily cast into the matrix form , viz .",
    "@xmath30 where we define the three @xmath31 transfer matrices @xmath32 as , @xmath33 according to the nature of the @xmath12th site ( i.e. @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) . with the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the transfer matrices",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 we are now in a position to analyze the electron states and transmission properties of the equivalent one - dimensional lattice [ fig.1(b ) ] using the rsrg method .",
    "variation of @xmath45 with @xmath11 when @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . ]",
    "we now present the results of our calculation in relation to the transmission properties of finite csw of arbitrary lengths .",
    "let us , without losing any physics , stick to a particular model of the waveguide array , consisting of equispaced stubs of two different lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the equivalent one dimensional lattice then consists of two different on - site potentials @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and a constant hopping integral @xmath51 .",
    "this geometry is easily achieved by setting @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 so that , @xmath55",
    ". the transfer matrices are now of two types , viz . @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the product transfer matrix for a csw at the @xmath58th generation is given by @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    ".2 in in order to evaluate the transmission coefficient of a cantor stub waveguide ( csw ) at any generation , we place the equivalent one - dimensional sample between two semi - infinite leads .",
    "the lead , in a tight binding description , is characterized by identical on - site potentials @xmath61 and constant hopping integral @xmath62 .",
    "the transmission coefficient for such a system then can be worked out in terms of the traces and anti - traces @xcite of the relevant transfer matrices and for a @xmath58th generation cantor stub array it is given by , @xmath63 where , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the trace and anti - traces can be evaluated recursively by using the equations , @xmath67-u_{f_l-2}(x_b)[x_l^2 - 2 ] \\nonumber \\\\ y_{l+1 } & = & u_{f_l -1}(x_b)[y_lw_l+y_b]-u_{f_l -2}(x_b)x_ly_l \\nonumber \\\\ z_{l+1 } & = & u_{f_l -1}(x_b)[z_lw_l+z_b]-u_{f_l -2}(x_b)x_ly_l \\nonumber \\\\ w_{l+1 } & = & u_{f_l -1}(x_b)[w_l^2 - 2]-u_{f_l -2}(x_b)[x_lw_l - x_b]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the mth order chebyshev polynomial of the second kind .",
    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the initial values of the traces and anti - traces are @xmath74 - 1]}{t^2}\\nonumber \\\\ z_1 & = & \\frac{(e-\\epsilon_a)^2(e-\\epsilon_b)}{t^3}-\\frac{2(e-\\epsilon_a)}{t}+\\frac{(e-\\epsilon_b)}{t}\\nonumber \\\\ w_1 & = & \\frac{(e-\\epsilon_a)^2(e-\\epsilon_b)^2}{t^4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{4(e-\\epsilon_a)(e-\\epsilon_b)}{t^2}+2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fig.2 we present the variation of the transmission coefficient against the wave vector ranging from zero to @xmath75 for the second and fourth generation cantor stub waveguide system .",
    "it is seen that there is a wide central gap is the spectrum with the finite transmission zones clustering around @xmath76 and @xmath77 . with increasing size , the two sub - bands around @xmath78 and @xmath77 start getting fragmented [ fig.2(b ) ] , giving rise to multiple closely spaced zones of high transmission separated from each other by gaps . keeping all other parameters fixed as in fig.2 , a change in the value of one of the stub lengths , say , @xmath7 ,",
    "is found to produce notable changes in the transmission spectrum as well as in the nature of the eigenfunction .",
    "this aspect may be used in a possible experimental setup in order to control the transport at a specified value of the wave - vector .",
    "let us clarify by giving an example .",
    "we set @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding value of the wave - vector satisfies the equation @xmath80 it can easily be checked that the above choice of @xmath11 ( or @xmath81 ) makes @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that an arbitrarily large cantor sequence of stubs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 becomes indistinguishable from a periodic array of the triplet @xmath83 if @xmath84 happens to be in the allowed energy spectrum of an infinite periodic chain of the triplet , we get an extended eigenfunction , even though the original cantor sequence lacks translational invariance .",
    "in fig.3 we plot the variation of @xmath45 with @xmath7 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath48 within half a period .",
    "an interesting feature in fig.3 is that for such a value of the wave - vector to correspond to a finite appreciable value of the transmission coefficient , @xmath7 has to exceed a threshold value .",
    "we have not been able to determine the threshold exactly , but careful numerical search has revealed that , as one deals with longer and longer generation segments , the threshold remains close to @xmath87 ( in the unit of @xmath88 ) . for bigger generations change in the threshold value of @xmath7 becomes practically un - noticible     @xmath45 vs @xmath7 with @xmath85 , @xmath46 , and @xmath48 ( a ) second generation , ( b ) third generation ( c ) fourth generation . ]",
    ".2 in it is instructive to look at the distribution of amplitudes of the wave function for the above value of @xmath11 for a semi - infinite stub array .",
    "it is well known that the clusters of impurities in a one dimensional chain are likely to give rise to unscattered ( resonant ) eigenstates .",
    "this is true for a random dimer model @xcite and its extensions , and for a certain class of quasi - periodic chains as well @xcite . in the same spirit",
    "one can search for @xmath11-values corresponding to extended wave - function in a csw network by making higher powers of @xmath89 equal to identity matrix .",
    "the method is well known @xcite , and we do not repeat it to save space . in the example",
    "discussed above , the amplitude profile reflects a perfectly extended character , and assumes an interesting lattice - like distribution @xcite for a specific value of @xmath47 . in fig.4",
    "we show such a lattice - like profile of an extended eigenstate .",
    "other combinations of the wave - vector and the system parameters also give rise to similar observations .",
    "however whether the amplitude distribution resemble the lattice or not depends on the specific values of the parameters , the wave - function may be of an extended nature .",
    "lattice - like profile of an extended eigenstate where @xmath90 .",
    "we have taken @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]",
    "we begin this section by noting that an infinite cantor stub array can be renormalized into a scaled version of itself simply by using the growth rule in the opposite direction . in terms of the equivalent one - dimensional chain",
    "this implies the decimation of a subset of sites .",
    "the resulting rsrg recursion relations for the on - site potentials and the hopping integrals are found to be , @xmath91 where , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is well known that a flow of the hopping integrals under successive rsrg steps provide information about the nature of the wave - function .",
    "for example , for an extended wave - function the hopping integrals never flow to zero under any number of rsrg iterations whereas , for a localized state at least one of the two hopping integral will flow to zero under rsrg .",
    "however , for the latter case one has to ensure that the chosen energy does not fall into a gap in the spectrum of the infinite lattice .",
    ".2 in we stick to the discussion of a model consisting , as before , of two different equispaced stubs of lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an rsrg treatment of this model needs the general recursion relations ( 10 ) described before .",
    "the present model can be retrieved from the general model described before by setting @xmath54 and @xmath94 .",
    "we now have @xmath95 .",
    "let us now choose @xmath96 which results in the equation @xmath97 this condition is easily be achieved , for a given value of the lattice spacing @xmath88 , by appropriately choosing the stub length @xmath8 .",
    "for example , with @xmath86 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath8 can assume values equal to @xmath100 ( in unit of @xmath88 ) for which the above equation is satisfied .",
    "the length of the other stub @xmath7 , of course remains free to be chosen .",
    "even though we start up with the special model , on decimation , we land up with a mixed one and one has to use the set of recursion relation ( 10 ) for drawing conclusion .",
    "iterating the set of eq.(10 ) we observe that @xmath37 and @xmath39 remain fixed at their initial values while @xmath101 exhibit a two cycle fixed point behaviour , viz , @xmath102 @xmath103 most interestingly @xmath38 increases on successive renormalization following the prescription @xmath104 @xmath12 indicating the stage of renormalization .",
    "this implies that an electron propagating in the cantor stub network with above specification will experience , in a renormalization group sense , progressively higher potential barriers resulting in a decay in the value of the transmission coefficient as the system grows in size .",
    "amplitude @xmath105 growth pattern for ( a ) @xmath106 , ( b ) @xmath47 and ( c ) @xmath107 for @xmath108 ( in unit of inter - lattice spacing ) . here , @xmath109 .",
    "]    a pertinent question in this regard is , whether @xmath110 belongs to the spectrum of an infinite or semi - infinite chain .",
    "the answer is ` no ' . with respect to the amplitude on the first site , the amplitudes at distant sites keep on increasing for larger and larger system and consistent solutions of the difference equation ( 5 )",
    "is not possible to obtain in this case .",
    "however , it is interesting to note , and simple to check that , the same set of all the parameters yields a perfectly allowed , even a periodic distribution of @xmath111 when any arbitrary generation of a cantor segment is clamped between two semi - infinite perfect leads , where the leads are described by identical scatterers placed periodically .",
    "the growth of the potential @xmath38 under rsrg implies that an electron released in the middle of a large cluster of @xmath1 nodes will experience high potential walls on either side and will be ultimately trapped in this well if the system size is large enough .",
    "this fact co - exists with the fixed point behaviour of the nearest neighbour hopping integrals which usually characterize an extended eigenstate .",
    "we thus come across a set of , what we may call , ` atypical ' eigenstates .",
    ".2 in both the growth of the amplitude and the decaying transmission coefficient can easily be estimated if we note that for @xmath110 , and @xmath112 , we get @xmath113 , so that any arbitrarily large generation of a cantor segment of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s become identical , from the standpoint of the propagating electron , to a periodic array of the unit cells ` @xmath114 ' .",
    "the transfer matrix across a finite @xmath58th generation array now reads @xmath115 where , @xmath116 is the number of @xmath114-blocks left in the @xmath58th generation after the central clusters of @xmath1 yielding identity matrices .",
    "this leads to the power law decay in the transmission coefficient as a function of @xmath116 , viz , @xmath117     variation of the maximum value of the amplitude in a cantor waveguide as a function of the stub length @xmath7 .",
    "the solid and the dashed curves correspond to ( a ) @xmath108 and ( b ) @xmath118 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath48 , @xmath119 .",
    "we show @xmath120 up to 150 for clarity . ]    before ending this section , it is worth mentioning that , by tuning the length of the other stub @xmath7 one can reduce the growth of the wave - functions for @xmath11-values which fall in the spectral gap of a semi - infinite cantor sequence of stubs .",
    "the amplitude of such a wave - function usually exhibits a slowly increasing pattern interspaced with flat constant regions corresponding to the periodic clusters of @xmath1 s in between the @xmath0 s . the maximum amplitude for @xmath108 , say , at any generation @xmath58 occurs at the @xmath121th site as can easily be checked . in fig.5",
    "we exhibit the flattening of the amplitude growth pattern for three different values of @xmath7 . by changing @xmath7 continuously from 0 to 1 ,",
    "we get a smooth decay of the largest value of the amplitude occurring in any generation until with @xmath122 , we get a completely periodic distribution of @xmath111 . at this stage",
    "the lattice becomes indistinguishable from a periodic one .",
    "6 shows how the largest value of the amplitude in a @xmath123-stub array drops from large values to @xmath124 .",
    "variation of transmission coefficient as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath108 .",
    "we have taken @xmath48 , @xmath119 .",
    "solid , dashed , broken and dotted curve correspond to first , second , third and forth generation csw respectively . ]",
    ".2 in the same aspect is reflected in the variation of @xmath45 as a function of the stub - length ( @xmath7 , for example ) .",
    "shows that perfect resonance occurs at @xmath125 only which represents a periodic array of stubs .",
    "for all other values of @xmath7 the transmittance decays as the system grows in size ( i.e. as @xmath126 increases ) .",
    "the ` switch - over ' to complete transparency occurs sharply at @xmath125 only when the system is infinitely large i.e. an ` off ' to ` on ' state can be obtained as @xmath7 is varied across the value unity .",
    "in conclusion , we have used the renormalization group idea and a transfer matrix method , to examine the electronic states and transport in finite and infinite stubbed waveguide network constructed following a triadic cantor geometry . apart from usual extended eigenfunctions which correspond to complete transmission ,",
    "such a waveguide network when clamped between two perfectly ordered semi - infinite leads , is found to support ` atypical ' states which may display a periodic pattern of amplitude and yet the end - to - end transmission decays as the system grows in size .",
    "we provide our explanation from a renormalization group point of view .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically , the character of electronic eigenstates and transmission properties of a one dimensional array of stubs with cantor geometry . within the framework of real space re - normalization group ( rsrg ) and transfer matrix methods we analyze the resonant transmission and extended wave - functions in a cantor array of stubs , which lack translational order . apart from resonant states with high transmittance we unravel a whole family of wave - functions supported by such an array clamped between two - infinite ordered leads , which have an extended character in the rsrg scheme , but , for such states the transmission coefficient across the lead - sample - lead structure decays following a power - law as the system grows in size . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is explained from renormalization group ideas and may lead to the possibility of trapping of electronic , optical or acoustic waves in such hierarchical geometries . </S>"
