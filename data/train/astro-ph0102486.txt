    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy strongly support the flat universe predicted by inflationary cosmology . at the same time , there are strong evidences , i.e. from dynamical estimates or x - ray and lensing observations of clusters of galaxies , that the today pressureless matter parameter of the universe @xmath6 is significantly less than unity ( @xmath7 + [ 0.04 { \\pm } 0.01]$ ] , where cdm and b respectively stand for cold dark matter and baryons ) , while the hot matter ( photons and neutrinos ) is really neglectable .",
    "flatness so requires another positive contribute to the energy density of the universe , the so called dark energy ",
    "see , for example , silveira & waga or turner & white  that , according to the recent data from snia , must have negative pressure to account for an accelerated expanding universe .",
    "one of the possible solutions of this puzzle is the @xmath8cdm universe where the fraction @xmath9 of the dark energy is supported by a cosmological constant @xmath8 .",
    "a very promising altervative , the quintessence , was proposed by caldwell , dave & steinhardt in the form of a dynamical , spatially inhomogeneous energy with negative pressure , i.e. the energy of a slowly evolving scalar field with positive potential energy .",
    "apart from flatness , a scalar field coupled to matter through gravitation can also explain the so called coincidence problem , that is , it can provide a mechanism to make the today densities of matter and dark energy comparable . as shown in wang et al .",
    ", a large set of indipendent observations agrees with a universe described in terms of pressureless matter and quintessence only , a hypothesis that we will make in this paper .",
    "a scalar field is not an ideal adiabatic fluid and the sound speed in it varies with the wavelength in such a way that high frequency modes remain stable still when @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , smoothness is gauge dependent , and so a fluctuating inhomogeneous energy component is naturally defined .",
    "inhomogeneities , both in quintessence and cdm , make the relations for the distances derived in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models not immediately applicable to the interpetration of experimental data both in measurements of luminosity distances and angular diameter distances .",
    "the observed universe appears to be homogeneously distributed only on large scales ( @xmath11 mpc ) , while the propagation of light is a local phenomena . in lack of a really satisfactory exact solution for inhomogeneous universes in the framework of general relativity @xcite , the usual",
    ", very simple framework we shall adopt for the study of distances is the _ on average flrw universe _ ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ; seitz , schneider & ehlers 1994 ) , where : _",
    "i ) _ the relations on a large scale are the same of the corresponding flrw universe ; _ ii ) _ the anisotropic distortion of the bundle of light rays contributed by external inhomogeneities ( the shear @xmath12 ) is not significant ; _ iii ) _ only the fraction @xmath3 , the so called smoothness parameter , of the @xmath13-component contributes to the ricci focusing @xmath14 , that is to the isotropic focusing of the bundle .",
    "the distance recovered in this empty beam approximation , sometimes known as dyer - roeder ( dr ) distance , has been long studied ( zeldovich 1964 ; kantowski 1969 ; dyer & roeder 1972 , 1973 ; linder 1988 ) and now is becoming established as a very useful tool for the interpretation of experimental data ( kantowski 1998 ; kantowski & thomas 2000 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; giovi , occhionero & amendola 2000 ) . for a very large sample of standard candles , as snia for luminosity distance , or standard rods , as compact radio sources for angular diameter distances ( gurvits , kellermann & frey 1999 ) , the effects of overdensity and underdensity along different lines of sight between observer and sources balance each other out , and the mean distance of the probability distribution of distances for fixed source redshift , corresponding to the flrw distance , can be used ( wang 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the present quite poor samples , sources are very rarely brightened by the gravitational effect of occurring overdense clumps , and so , for propagation of light far from local inhomogeneities , the source appears dimmer and smaller with respect to the homogeneous case .",
    "so the distance to be used is the mode of the distribution , that is , in a very good approximation , the dr distance @xcite . in general , the smoothness parameters for matter and quintessence ( respectively @xmath5 and @xmath15 ) and the equation of state @xmath2 are redshift dependent , but they can be considered , in the redshift interval covered by observations , as constant .",
    "for the clumpiness parameters , the constancy is motivated by the absence of significant variations in the development of structures in the observed redshift range . instead , also in presence of redshift variations in @xmath2 ,",
    "only its integral properties have effect on the distance .",
    "in fact , in flat flrw models the distance depends on @xmath2 only through a triple integral on the redshift ( maor , brustein & steinhardt 2000 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will consider the @xmath3 and @xmath2 as constant .",
    "for the cosmological constant @xmath16 ; a network of light , nonintercommuting topological defects @xcite gives @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dimension of the defect : for a string @xmath19 , for a domain wall @xmath20 ; an accelerated universe requires @xmath21 .    in this approximation",
    ", distances are functions of a family of parameters : @xmath6 and @xmath9 , which describe the energy content of the universe on large scales ; @xmath2 , which describes the equation of state of the quintessence and varies between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; two clumpiness parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath15 , representing the degree of homogeneity of the universe and which are to be used for phenomena of local propagation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect.2 we introduce the so called dr equation and discuss some features and its solution for quintessence in the form of topological defects ; sect.3 lists the general solution for the dr equation in the flat case and some simple expressions in extreme situations ; in sect.4 the multiple lens - plane theory of gravitational lensing is applied for a derivation of the dr equation without using the focusing equation ; sect.5 is devoted to the degeneracy of the distance with respect to the various parameters ; in sect.6 the critical redshift at which the angular diameter distance takes its maximum is studied , and , at last , in sect.7 we draw the conclusions .",

    ", @xmath219 is very sensitive to @xmath5 , especially for large values of @xmath6 since @xmath5 appears in the dr equation as a multiplicative factor of @xmath6 . for @xmath236 , @xmath237 and 3.23 for , respectively , @xmath214 and 0.2 , a variation of 100% .",
    "so , combining different cosmological tests to constrain the other cosmological parameters , we can use the redshift - distance relation to guess the smoothness parameter @xmath5 in a quite efficient way .",
    "we conclude this section comparing the influence of @xmath5 and @xmath2 on the critical redshift .",
    "fig.[zmax_w_al ] displays @xmath219 in the @xmath238 plane , for @xmath6 fixed to 0.3 and with @xmath45 .",
    "as expected , @xmath219 increases when the focusing decreases , that is for small values of @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that the effects of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are of the same order .",
    "the question of light propagation in an inhomogeneous universe is an open topic of modern cosmology and the necessity of a positive solution grows up with the increasing means of experimental technology that begins to explore very high redshifts .",
    "in particular , the cosmological distances , which provide important probes of the universe , are very sensitive to cosmological inhomogeneities .",
    "in fact , in the present quite poor data samples , sources usually appear dimmer and smaller with respect to homogeneous models for the systematic effect of under - densities along the different lines of sight . here",
    ", we have investigated the properties of the angular diameter distance in presence of either clumpy pressureless matter and inhomogeneous dark energy using the empty beam approximation.    the equation for the angular diameter distance with respect to the redshift has been found in a way that is indipendent from the focusing equation . the multiple lens - plane theory allows to derive the dr equation for inhomogeneous quintessence , in a way that makes clear the importance of the empty beam approximation in the gravitational lensing .",
    "we have given useful forms for the distance .",
    "for non flat universe , we have studied the case of cosmic string network , when the angular diameter distance is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions , and an accelerated universe with @xmath239 ( domain walls ) , when the distance - redshift relation is given in terms of heun functions . for the very interesting case of flat universes with inhomogeneous quintessence",
    ", we have obtained the solution of the dr equation in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "then , we have listed the expressions for the distance when it takes the form of elementary functions for two particular cases of flat models : strictly homogeneous ( we have considered cosmic string networks again ) and totally inhomogeneous universes , i.e. both pressureless matter and dark energy solely in clumps .",
    "as it could be reasonably expected , the angular diameter distance is degenerate , also considering a smooth quintessence , with respect to cosmological parameters : although there is a strong dependence both on the smoothness parameter @xmath5 and the equation of state @xmath2 , the intrinsic systematic errors prevent us to univocally determine the cosmological parameters only from measurements of distance .",
    "nevertheless , combinig these data with indipendent observations like that concerning the cosmic microwave backgroung radiation , we can estimate the smoothness parameter @xmath5 by determining the critical redshift , for example .",
    "the effect of @xmath2 and @xmath5 , especially at high redshifts , are of the same order but very different .",
    "an increase in @xmath2 mimics a larger @xmath6 , while a more inhomogeneous universe ( small @xmath5 ) mimics the effect of a cosmological constant .",
    "this last statement agrees with what found by clrier @xcite , in a very different context , that is by relaxing the hypothesis of large scale homogeneity for the universe .",
    "we have obtained a similar result by adopting the cosmological principle .",
    "the authors wish to thank g. platania , c. rubano and p. scudellaro for discussions and valuable comments on the manuscript ."
