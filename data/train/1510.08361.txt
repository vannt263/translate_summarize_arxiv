    "a charged particle moving in two dimensions under the influence of a spatially varying perpendicular magnetic field can exhibit snake state trajectories .",
    "these are open two - dimensional orbits perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field gradient .",
    "snake trajectories occur in both the classical and quantum limits of this problem and are of fundamental interest with potential applications for electron transport in multidomain ferromagnets , two - dimensional electron gases  @xcite , and in nanomaterials like graphene  @xcite . in the quantum limit",
    "the snake states can be interpreted as the protected modes that occur at domain walls that separate topologically mismatched gapped ground states .",
    "this picture suggests that snake trajectories can arise even in a _ uniform _ magnetic field if the particle density is suitably modulated laterally , e.g. by electrostatic gating patterned to form interfaces between distinct quantum hall ground states .",
    "indeed exactly this possibility has been explored theoretically  @xcite and examined experimentally for graphene in a uniform perpendicular magnetic field via measurements of the hall conductance and of fabry - perot like oscillations in the inter - edge conductance across graphene _ pn _ junctions  @xcite .",
    "graphene is an excellent candidate for this application because it can be electrostatically switched from _",
    "n _ to _ p _ carrier types and studied in the ballistic transport regime  @xcite .",
    "the converse problem of snake trajectories for a uniform carrier density in a spatially varying magnetic field is even more technically challenging and it has not been examined experimentally ( for a theoretical discussion see ref .  ) . on the other hand , a variant of this latter problem _ is _ routinely encountered in present - day experimental environments . in single - layer graphene subject to elastic lattice strains , the low - energy electronic structure is described by a dirac hamiltonian containing a strain - induced gauge field that mimics the effects of a perpendicular ( albeit valley antisymmetric ) magnetic field . for generic smoothly varying strain fields",
    "the presence of nodal lines that separate regions of  positive \" and  negative \" pseudo - magnetic field in a single valley is a nearly unavoidable consequence of the symmetry of this strain coupling .",
    "the  antisymmetric @xmath0 \" and  antisymmetric doping ( @xmath1 ) \" problems break both time reversal symmetry @xmath2 ( due to the presence of a magnetic field ) and particle - hole symmetry @xmath3 ( they require a nonzero carrier density ) .",
    "nonetheless they retain different composite symmetry operations that combine these discrete symmetries with twofold rotation about the layer normal @xmath4 : the former problem is symmetric under @xmath5 and the latter under @xmath6 .",
    "this difference manifests itself in many of the spectral properties presented in section i. in fact , this distinction persists even into the classical limit , and reflects the different underlying dynamics of these two problems . in the antisymmetric-@xmath0 problem a snake state trajectory arises from the compensation of the circulation of cyclotron orbits in regions where the magnetic field is reversed . in the antisymmetric-@xmath1 it arises from one - sided skipping orbits due to an electric field at the interface of a @xmath7 junction .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that these problems exhibit the _ same _ pattern of boundary and interface currents .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of confinement of these boundary modes at the interface between topologically mismatched gapped ground states on either side of the interface .",
    "it is therefore of interest to understand precisely how these different problems are related in the bulk . in this paper",
    "we observe that these two situations are in fact gauge equivalent representations of the same problem .",
    "however our demonstration of this equivalence requires that we extend both problems in a nambu - doubled formulation , explicitly restoring particle hole symmetry about a nonzero chemical potential . in this",
    "doubled representation we find that the problems are interconverted by local gauge transformations exploiting the particle and hole degrees of freedom in the nambu basis . among the insights provided by this approach ,",
    "we observe that the interfacial degrees of freedom common to the two problems ( the snake states ) are mapped to a model for the bogoliubov quasiparticles in a one - dimensional superconductor along the tangent line that supports a  p - wave \" pairing field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i we begin by comparing the spectra for antisymmetrically doped graphene ( a _ pn _ junction ) in uniform field with the spectrum for uniform doping in an antisymmetric field . in section",
    "ii we present a family of local gauge transformations that allow one to map one problem onto the other . in section iii",
    "we implement this procedure for the case of the graphene _ pn _ junction and analyze the structure of the uniformly doped antisymmetric field problem to which it maps . in section",
    "iv we present a topological analysis of the ground state manifolds in these models , concluding that they are the same and are members of the altland - zirnbauer chiral symmetry class c , i.e. they are indexed by even integer - valued winding numbers . in section",
    "v we use a variational approach to determine the spatial structure of the interface modes .",
    "we consider snake state solutions in two limits of a tight - binding theory for electrons on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the peierls phase accumulated in a ( possibly nonconstant ) perpendicular magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "we adopt a coordinate system where the scalar potential @xmath11 and the vector potential @xmath12 are spatially varying in the @xmath13 direction and constant along @xmath14 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath15 is set so that the left and right sectors are simultaneously gapped .",
    "the calculations are carried out for  zigzag \" interfaces , where a domain wall at @xmath16 is tangent to a primitive translation vector along @xmath14 .",
    "we examine two limiting domain wall geometries . in the first we assume that the system is uniformly doped ,",
    "say @xmath17-type on both sides of an interface where @xmath18 changes sign . in the second we consider the complementary case where the @xmath0 field is uniform ( or at least a symmetric function of @xmath13 with no sign changes ) , and instead the external scalar potential @xmath19 with zero mean changes its sign on an interface defining a @xmath7 junction .",
    "we show that the edge - state solutions for these two limits are the same despite the different microscopic dynamics .",
    "this manifests a topological equivalence of their bulk ground states .",
    "indeed we find that these can be mapped into each other by gauge transformations that mix the particle and hole degrees of freedom when the problem is rewritten in a nambu particle - hole basis .",
    "this leads to the possibility of inventing architectures that simulate unusual ballistic transport effects like andreev reflection even in the absence of a physical superconducting condensate . in the following",
    ", we will first discuss the two limits separately and then analyze their gauge equivalence .",
    "we assume that the system is uniformly slightly doped @xmath17-type and has an antisymmetric magnetic field profile @xmath20 .",
    "the spectrum for this problem is displayed in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the vertical red lines denote the projections of the bulk @xmath21 and @xmath22 dirac points , i.e. in the absence of a field these are the interface - projected locations of the bulk gap closures .    for an antisymmetric @xmath18",
    "the vector potential in landau gauge is an even function with @xmath23 .",
    "consequently the system supports normalizable ( near ) zero - energy states that are  one - sided \" in momentum space as shown in fig .",
    "there are two types of momentum - space anisotropy evident in these spectra : ( a ) the @xmath0-induced zero modes occur only for @xmath24 in both valleys ( b ) the @xmath25 spectrum near @xmath22 supports an additional pair of zero modes due to the undercoordinated atoms at the zigzag edges ( the total orbital degeneracy of the @xmath25 spectrum is actually four in this region ) .",
    "the additional low - energy modes bridge the @xmath22 and @xmath21 points where they smoothly evolve into the field - induced zero modes in the opposite valley . in either case",
    "the transition from @xmath25 to @xmath26 marks a crossover where the zero - energy degrees of freedom hybridize to produce a pair of particle - hole symmetric propagating modes that are confined to the domain wall . for @xmath17 type doping",
    "( as illustrated ) this pair of interfacial modes copropagate along @xmath27 . physically the pair of domain wall modes combine cyclotron orbital states of opposite circulation to confine their motion near the interface .    the dispersion of the outer - edge modes near the right - hand @xmath22 valley is particularly instructive .",
    "note that this band is nearly flat for small @xmath25 but it becomes strongly dispersive with positive group velocity for sufficiently large negative @xmath28 .",
    "this occurs via hybridization of the sublattice - polarized edge degree of freedom with the landau zero mode _ on the opposite sublattice _ when their guiding centers are forced to the outer edges of the ribbon .",
    "note that the antisymmetry of @xmath18 requires that the guiding centers are forced to opposite outer edges at the same value of the crystal momentum @xmath29 .",
    "these dispersive outer edge modes constitute a return path for the topological current induced in the domain wall .",
    "these features can be identified in the spatial distribution of the probability ( or charge ) densities plotted in figs .",

    "the system is @xmath38-doped for @xmath39 and @xmath17-doped for @xmath40 .",
    "again one finds four dispersing modes at the fermi energy : two with negative velocity at the domain wall , and two with positive velocity confined on the outer edges . despite this similarity ,",
    "the mechanism producing the edge state structure is quite different .",
    "we note that the @xmath41 signature of the landau quantization of the dirac spectrum is observed for @xmath42 in the @xmath21 valley but for @xmath43 in the @xmath22 valley , i.e. the landau quantized spectra are both one - sided in momentum space , but with opposite senses in the two valleys . in the forbidden regions @xmath25 and @xmath44 the spectrum collapses to a pair of nearly degenerate orbital doublets that connect the two valleys .",
    "this degeneracy is exact at @xmath45 : the energy jump that is produced by the transition @xmath26 to @xmath25 ( and vice versa for @xmath46 ) is the quantized energy spacing between the zeroth and first landau levels , so all the levels for @xmath47 are twofold degenerate .    here",
    "the dispersion of the confined interfacial modes can be understood as a response to the lateral electric field produced in the @xmath7 junction . as @xmath13 crosses zero the scalar potential @xmath19 switches its sign and",
    "the internal electric field @xmath48 is nonzero .",
    "thus a state with drift velocity @xmath49 sees no deflection and can propagate freely .",
    "this can be contrasted with the guiding - center mechanism that liberates these modes in the former antisymmetric-@xmath0 problem where @xmath50 and one requires the compensation of the circulation in orbits in reversed @xmath0 fields to produce freely propagating interfacial snake states .",
    "interestingly , the appearance of dispersive edge modes on the _ outer _ boundaries follows exactly the same recipe as for the antisymmetric @xmath0 problem .",
    "the guiding center of the landau zero mode which is sublattice polarized , is forced to the outer edge of the ribbon where it hybridizes with the zigzag surface state on a complementary sublattice to form the one - way dispersive excitation . however , because the @xmath0 field is constant in this problem , the guiding centers are forced to the outer edges of the ribbon at opposite momenta @xmath51 .",

    "it is striking that despite the different microscopic origins of the domain wall solutions and the different structure of the full spectra apparent in figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig4 ] ,",
    "the basic pattern of the edge state currents is the same .",
    "this is evidence of the topological character of these modes . by negating either @xmath0 or @xmath1 at the interface",

    "this relation offers the interesting possibility of generalizing coherent quantum transport phenomena such as andreev reflection or veselago lensing , to a new family of graphene - derived architectures .",
    "our results imply two  no - go \" theorems for this system .",
    "first , the gauge - transformed representation of the interfacial problem describes a one - dimensional particle / hole gas coupled by a pairing field with p - wave symmetry . in principle , this class of models can support majorana excitations in an appropriate parameter regime  @xcite .",
    "however , the prospects for realizing such excitations in this setup are remote .",
    "we find that the doubled problem has the discrete symmetries of altland - zirnbauer symmetry class c so that its gapped ground state is indexed by an _ even _ integer - valued ( @xmath202 ) index . here",
    "topological domain wall solutions must appear in pairs , and the possibility of having an unpaired majorana excitation appearing on the boundary , or at its ends are excluded .",
    "this is understandable , since the appearance of such an excitation would not admit an interpretation in the original ( number conserving ) representation of the same problem .",
    "second , it is intriguing that under the gauge transformation the interfacial problem exhibits an apparent broken @xmath108 gauge symmetry due to the pseudo - pairing field .",
    "however , this seems not to be associated with any measurable collective effects in the interface : spatial variations of the phase of the order parameter are the images of momentum shifts of the spectrum in the original number - conserving representation of the problem , which is simply a gauge choice .",
    "again , any nontrivial property arising from the pairing field would require a dual interpretation in the number - conserving representation of the same problem .",
    "it remains an open question as to whether one might further break the symmetries of the original problem to identify measurable consequences of these symmetries in its gauge transformed image .",
    "our results highlight several directions for exploiting the structure of the domain wall solutions .",
    "it is possible that the sublattice and valley asymmetries found for two problems could be exploited to valley filter ballistic transport in patterned graphene .",
    "the two - channel interfacial solutions may also provide a venue for important one - dimensional interaction effects that are accessible in nonlocal transport measurements between reservoirs bridged by a domain wall . finally , we also note that while graphene provides a natural starting point for developing this formulation , the conclusions appear to be generally valid for ballistic transport in domain walls separating topologically gapped ground states in a wider class of semiconductor nanostructures .",
