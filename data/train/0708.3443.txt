    "the second method is explained in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses a novel algorithmic trick combined with appropriate data structures to decrease the running time of the search .",
    "one advantageous feature of this algorithm is that the symmetries of the independent sets generated are available with no additional computation required .",
    "this method proved much faster by a factor of @xmath50 ; the relationship between the performance difference which can be attributed to the algorithm versus the quality of the programming has not been determined .",
