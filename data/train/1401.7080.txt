    "2011 ) and non - relativistic studies ( giacalone & jokipii 2007 ; inoue et al . 2009 ; inoue & inutsuka 2012 ; guo et al .",
    "2012 ) , the postshock magnetic field is amplified through turbulent motions .",
    "the amplified magnetic field assumes filamentary structures , and its power spectrum is flatter than kolmogorov , which is typical for a turbulent dynamo process .",
    "we find that the saturation level of turbulent field amplification depends on the initial magnetic - field strength .",
    "if the initial field is strong , the postshock region becomes turbulent but field amplification does not occur . at a perpendicular shock",
    ", the magnetic field is first compressed at the shock and then amplified by turbulent motion in the postshock region .",
    "the total field enhancement is larger than at parallel shocks , as observed by mizuno et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "generally , saturation occurs when the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy in the postshock region .",
    "this implies that magnetic - field amplification via turbulent motion happens only if the magnetic energy after shock compression is smaller than the turbulent kinetic energy in the postshock region .    in our simulations",
    "the turbulent velocity in the postshock region is sub - relativistic and subsonic , even for a strong relativistic shock .",
    "all our simulations employ comparable small - amplitude ( @xmath151 ) density fluctuations in the pre - shock medium .",
    "we note that analytical work by sironi & goodman ( 2007 ) ( see also goodman & macfadyen 2008 ) indicates that the energy density of vortical motions , generated in an interaction between an ultra - relativistic shock and a small - amplitude density fluctuation , increases with the square of the density contrast ( i.e. , the postshock turbulent velocity grows linearly with the density fluctuation amplitude ) .",
    "thus , larger density perturbations lead to greater deformations of the shock front and produce stronger vorticity in the postshock region . as a result , the magnetic field can be more efficiently amplified .",
    "this analytical prediction has been recently confirmed in mhd relativistic shock simulations by inoue et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( see also guo et al .",
    "2012 for the nonrelativistic case ) , who showed that the rate of the initial exponential growth of postshock magnetic turbulence is proportional to the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations .",
    "they also found that the shock - induced velocity dispersion can approach the postshock sound speed if the shock propagates in a medium with large - amplitude density inhomogeneities .",
    "however , it is not clear whether supersonic relativistic turbulence can be produced and maintained downstream of the shock .",
    "for example , in simulations initialized with turbulence by inoue et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the kinetic energy in relativistic turbulence decayed much faster than kinetic energy in transonic turbulence due to dissipation of relativistic turbulence into internal energy via shocklets .",
    "it remains to be verified that the same result applies to the case of turbulence driven by ultra - relativistic shock propagation through an upstream medium containing strong density contrasts .    in this paper",
    "we have performed simulations in two - dimensional geometry to take long simulation region in shock propagation direction in order to follow the saturation of magnetic - field amplification by turbulence in postshock region which did not achieved previous paper ( mizuno et al .",
    "in general the turbulence structure , for example the slope of the kolmogorov - like power spectrum , is different in two and three dimensions .",
    "although we expect that the possible difference is not significant ( see inoue et al .",
    "2009 ) , to more realistically analyze three - dimensional phenomena we will extend the current investigation to three - dimensional simulations in future work .    in grbs",
    ", afterglow modeling suggest that the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the internal energy density , @xmath152 , has a broad range of values in the emission region .",
    "our simulation results imply that the broad range suggested by the observations is indicative of different properties in the circumburst medium , e.g. , different amplitude of density fluctuations , and magnetic - field strength and direction , notwithstanding differences in shock strength . the strong variability in the prompt emission phase requires maintenance of strong relativistic turbulence in the emission region .",
    "if prompt emission were due to jet - medium interaction , then this would require a weak medium magnetic field strength .",
    "more likely , grb prompt emission is of an internal origin , which may invoke collisions of highly magnetized shells ( zhang & yan 2011 ) .",
    "our simulations in this paper do not apply to this regime , and future work is needed to test whether substantial reconnection - driven turbulence can be generated and maintained in a magnetically dominated flow .    in agn blazars",
    ", multi - waveband monitoring often finds rapidly variable gamma - ray flares that typically accompany lesser variability and/or increase in the emission at other wavebands .",
    " multi - wavelength light curves of gamma - ray bright blazars reveal strong correlations across wavebands , yet striking dissimilarities in the details .",
    "the linear polarization tends to be highly variable in both degree and position angle , which implies that the magnetic field is turbulent \" ( marscher 2013 ) . in general",
    ", the emission characteristics based on a turbulent plasma crossing a standing conical shock associated with the millimetre - wave core in vlba images of blazars agrees with the characteristics of multi - waveband light curves and polarization variations ( marscher 2011 ) .",
    "in particular , multi - waveband monitoring of ao 0235 + 164 and oj 287 indicates gamma - ray flares associated with enhanced emission from the 43 ghz radio core that is consistent with this turbulent cell model for variability ( marscher & jorstad 2010 ; agudo et al .",

    "our simulation results suggest that strong density inhomogeneities in the preshock relativistic jet fluid would lead to the development of strong turbulence in the post recollimation shock region from which the observed emission originates .",
    "the highest photon energies would come from the smallest regions containing the highest magnetic fields and exhibit the most rapid time variability .",
