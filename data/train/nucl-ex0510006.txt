    "electromagnetic probes are ideally suited to investigate hot and dense matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions because they do not undergo strong interactions and thus probe the full time evolution of the collision .",
    "the dielectron continuum is rich in physics .",
    "it is expected that dalitz decays of light hadrons , direct decays of vector mesons , as well as correlated charm decays contribute . at cern",
    "sps energies , the ceres experiment @xcite has discovered an enhanced dielectron yield over the expected sources , interpreted as hint for in medium modification of hadron spectral functions , in particular of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "although @xmath1 pairs are rare , the 0.24 nb@xmath2 collected by phenix in au+au collisions at @xmath3= 200 gev in 2004 provide a significant sample to investigate the dielectron continuum . in the following , the analysis of 766 m minimum bias events is presented .",
    "the phenix detector was designed for electron measurements .",
    "it combines excellent mass resolution ( 1% ) with powerful particle identification obtained by matching the reconstructed tracks with the information from a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "electrons are identified by requiring at least 3 phototubes matched in the rich and by correlating the energy @xmath4 measured in the emc and the momentum @xmath5 , parameterized in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "pair cuts are applied to avoid sharing of detector hits : shared hits in the drift chambers are removed with a cut on position parameters ; tracks which are parallel in the rich are rejected by a cut on the angular difference . whenever encountering such a pair , the complete event is rejected .",
    "+ pairs are created by combining all electrons and all positrons in one event .",
    "the overwhelming majority of these pairs is uncorrelated .",
    "a statistical procedure is used to determine this combinatorial background .",
    "since the phenix acceptance is different for like and unlike sign pairs , the combinatorial background is computed with a mixed event technique by pairing unlike sign tracks from different events with similar vertex position and centrality .",
    "the shape of the background is reproduced with high precision by the mixed event technique , and tested with the ratio of the like sign spectra for real and mixed events which deviates from one by less than 0.1% .",
    "+ four different methods have been tested to normalize the background distributions .",
    "the first normalizes the number of mixed events to the number of physical events .",
    "the second relies on the mean number of single electron and positron tracks which contribute to uncorrelated pairs @xmath7 . under the assumption that electron and positron multiplicities are poisson - distributed , and that the like sign pairs are uncorrelated , one can derive a third normalization as the geometrical mean of the like sign distributions @xmath8 .",
    "finally one can empirically normalize the background to the measured like sign distributions and apply the same factor to the unlike sign distribution .",
    "all the normalizations agree within 0.5% .",
    "the empiric normalization of the like sign pairs was chosen for the final results and a systematic uncertainty of 0.25% was assigned .",
    "+ after removal of the combinatorial background , the contribution of photon conversions was removed , cutting on the orientation angle of the pair in the magnetic field .",
    "finally the spectra are corrected for efficiency such that the data represent the dielectron yield for which electron and positron are in the detector acceptance ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows the measured dielectron pairs , the background , and the subtracted spectra with unctertainty : the error bars in the left panel correspond to all the systematic errors , which are dominated by the background normalization .",
    "the right panel shows separately the uncertainty arising from electron identification , efficiency , acceptance and run - by - run fluctuations , ( @xmath10 22% ) represented by the band around the data points , and the uncertainty on the background represented by the band around zero , which is the dominant source of the uncertainty due to the low signal to background ratio .",
    "+ after background subtraction , a significant signal remains over the full invariant mass range , corresponding to an integral of @xmath11 pairs , out of those 15,000 above the @xmath12 mass .",
    "the expectations are based on a cocktail of hadron decay sources . the pion spectrum used as input",
    "is determined by a parametrization of phenix charged and neutral pion data .",
    "the spectra of the other mesons are determined from the pion spectrum by @xmath15 scaling @xcite .",
    "the systematic error , depending on the pion yield and the relative cross section of the other contributions , varies from 10% to 25% .",
    "+ an additional source of dielectron pairs , which becomes dominant for invariant masses above 1@xmath16 is correlated charm production .",
    "this contribution has been simulated with pythia , scaling the p+p equivalent @xmath17 cross section of 622@xmath1857@xmath18160 @xmath19barn to minimum bias au+au collisions proportional to the number of binary collisions ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "+ the left panel of figure [ fig : cock ] shows the data compared to the cocktail .",
    "the data are in good agreement with the cocktail over the full mass range .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances are not fully reproduced , most likely because of the combined effect of an overstimate of the mass resolution in the event generator and low signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the data seem to lie above the cocktail in the region 0.3 - 0.8@xmath16 ( see table [ tab : yield ] for a quantitative comparison ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty however does not allow to draw any conclusive statement .",
    "the right panel shows the ratio of data to cocktail .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : rapp ] the data are compared to theoretical predictions ( @xcite,@xcite ) , where the @xmath23 invariant mass spectra @xmath24 have been calculated using different in - medium @xmath0 spectral functions and an expanding thermal fireball model .",
    "although the systematical uncertainty does not allow to state any deviation from the known sources , it is intriguing to observe the consistency of the data with predictions that include in - medium modifications in the same mass region where other experiments quantified such an effect ."
