    "the uhecr events with energy above @xmath1 ev are bounded by the primordial photon drag ( the well known gzk cut - off ) in a very narrow universe ( @xmath2 ) . because of their charge uhecr are bent and blurred by cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "however , uhecr because of their extremely rigidity maintain their primordial arrival direction .",
    "surprisingly , there are nt any nearby known galactic structures or super - galactic objects correlated with these uhe events which can accelerate protons at so high energy .",
    "recent agasa evidence of uhecr events clustering toward some bl lacs ( see table [ sorg ] ) seems to confirm a cosmic extra - galactic origin of uhecr from compact sources .",
    "so there is a puzzle to solve : if these uhecr ( just at the edge of gzk cut off energies ) are protons ( as experimental data suggest ) , how can they point to their primary bl lac sources ( often at large distance ) with a small ( @xmath3 ) angular dispersions ? there are two mechanisms to solve this puzzle : the rectilinear propagation of uhe proton from the source to the earth ( proposed by berezinsky ) within negligible extragalactic magnetic fields and the z - burst model @xcite,@xcite ( based on uhe zev neutrino scattering on relic light neutrinos in hot dark halos ) .",
    "both the processes mainly lead , as a by product , to a signal respectively in tev ( direct flight ) and gev ( z - burst ) photons .",
    "these photons can be observed either as afterglows or as precursors of the uhecr events .",
    "they may be ( respectively ) long lived showers ( direct flight ) of a few years or months or prompt signals ( z - burst ) within days or hours . in the following ,",
    "we will study these two different models and we will show that direct proton flight call for unobserved tev tails while the z - burst model is still the most competitive and realistic process to solve the gzk puzzle because it agrees with the observed gev gamma tails along the bl lac sources correlated to uhecr cluster events .",
    "1 .   explanation of the correlation between uhecr and bl lacs , without any charge problems ( uhecr maybe either proton or neutron or their anti - particles ) ; 2 .",
    "production of gamma - rays precursors and afterglows tails around gev energy where there are nt strong experimental bounds but even some positive evidence shown in correlation with egret gev identified sources , 3 .",
    "uhecr calibration with the observed light neutrino masses ( @xmath4 ev ) , well within known atmospheric mass splitting , naturally located in an extended hot dark halo within gzk distance , 4 .",
    "time delay arrival between the uhecr cluster compatible with observation and with the expected extra - galactic magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , in conclusion , the z - burst model is offering pion decays and gamma gev signature by synchrotron radiation whose presence is already found in egret ; any direct flights of uhecr from distant bl lac are often in disagreement with the charge sign observed and they call even for very high @xcite tev flux halo ; we have shown in present article that tev signals , whose fluence might be comparable or larger than uhecr fluxes , are absent in present data . therefore in our opinion , the z - burst is at present the most realistic model to explain uhecr events : we believe that a possible prompt observation of gamma - rays afterglows surrounding uhecr at mev - gev or at tev energies will test these two models .",
    "we suggest therefore a fast search by magic , hess and veritas telescopes within a short time scales ( minutes - hours - days or weeks ) toward the uhecr arrival directions , looking for gevs - tevs showering halo ( electromagnetic imprint of z - decay in flight and its synchrotron emission ) surrounding the uhecr event .",
    "also x - ray search by high resolution x - ray satellites as chandra pointing promptly toward uhecr arrivals directions might find exciting signatures of the shower afterglow along the particle path ."
