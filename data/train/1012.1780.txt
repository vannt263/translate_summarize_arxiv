    "in the popular `` core accretion '' scenario ( ca model hereafter ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the terrestrial planet cores form first from much smaller solid constituents .",
    "a massive gas atmosphere builds up around the rocky core if it reaches a critical mass of about @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ca model s main theoretical difficulty is in the very beginning of the growth : it is not clear how metre - sized rocks would stick together while colliding at high speeds , subject to high radial drifts into the parent star @xcite , although gas - dust dynamical instabilities are suggested to help ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , believed to be the only viable model for terrestrial planet formation , the model has enjoyed an almost universal support ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this strongest asset of the theory  a `` monopoly '' on making terrestrial planets  is actually void .",
    "recently , it has been proposed by @xcite that a modified version of the gravitational disc instability model for giant planet formation@xcite may account for terrestrial planets as well , if gas clump migration @xcite and clump disruption due to tidal forces @xcite are taken into account .",
    "this new scheme addresses @xcite all of the well known objections @xcite to forming jupiter in the solar system via disc fragmentation .",
    "the td hypothesis is a new combination of earlier ideas and contains four important stages ( figure 1 ) :    * formation of gas clumps ( which we also call giant planet embryos ; ges ) . as the protoplanetary disc can not fragment inside @xmath1 au @xcite , ges are formed at somewhat larger radii .",
    "the mass of the clumps is estimated at @xmath2 ( 10 jupiter masses ) @xcite ; they are intially fluffy and cool ( @xmath3 k ) , but contract with time and become much hotter @xcite .",
    "* inward radial migration of the clumps due to gravitational interactions with the surrounding gas disc @xcite . * grain growth and sedimentation inside the clumps @xcite .",
    "if the clump temperature remains below @xmath4k , massive terrestrial planet cores may form @xcite , with masses up to the total high z element content of the clump ( e.g. , @xmath5 earth masses for a solar metalicity clump of @xmath6 ) . * a disruption of ges in the inner few au due to tidal forces @xcite or due to irradiation from the star @xcite can result in ( a ) a smallish solid core and a complete gas envelope removal  a terrestrial planet ; ( b ) a massive solid core , with most of the gas removed  a uranus - like planet ; ( c ) a partial envelope removal leaves a gas giant planet like jupiter or saturn . for ( b ) , an internal energy release due to a massive core formation removes the envelope @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is the proper placement of step ( 1 ) into the outer reaches of the system and then the introduction of the radial migration ( step 2 ) that makes this model physically viable .",
    "the theory based on elements ( 3,4 ) from an earlier 1960-ies scenario for terrestrial planet formation by @xcite were rejected by @xcite because step ( 1 ) is not possible in the inner solar system .",
    "similarly , the giant disc instability @xcite can not operate at @xmath7 au to make jupiter @xcite .",
    "it is therefore the proper placement of step ( 1 ) into the outer reaches of the system and then the introduction of the radial migration ( step 2 ) that makes this model physically viable .",
    "the new hypothesis resolves @xcite an old mystery of the solar system : the mainly coherent and prograde rotation of planets , which is unexpected if planets are built by randomly oriented impacts .",
    "the gross structure of the solar system planets is naturally accounted for by the td model .",
    "the innermost terrestrial planets are located within the tidal disruption radius of @xmath8 au @xcite , so these are indeed expected to have no massive atmospheres .",
    "the asteroid belt in this scheme are the solids that grew inside the giant planet embryos but not made into the central core , and which were then left around the @xmath9 .",
    "the gas giant planets are somewhat outside the tidal disruption radius , and thus have been only partially affected by tidal disruption / solar irradiation .",
    "the outer icy giant planets are too far from the sun to have been affected strongly by it , so they are interesting cases of _ self - disruption _ in the td model . in particular , 35 years ago , @xcite suggested that the massive core formation in uranus and neptune evaporated most of their hydrogen envelopes . to appreciate the argument , compare the binding energy of the solid core with that of the ge .",
    "we expect the core of high - z elements to have a density @xmath10 a few g @xmath11 .",
    "the radial size of the solid core , @xmath12 .",
    "the binding energy of the solid core is @xmath13 the clump radius @xmath14 au at the age of @xmath15 years , independently of its mass@xcite , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the ge binding energy at that age is @xmath17 the two are comparable for @xmath18 .",
    "radiation hydrodynamics simulations confirm such internal disruption events : the run labelled m@xmath19 in @xcite made a @xmath20 solid core that unbound all but @xmath21 of the gaseous material of the original @xmath22 gas clump .",
    "future work on the td hypothesis should address the outer solar system structure ( kuiper belt ; comet compositions , etc . ) .",
    "detailed predictions for exo - planet observations are difficult as the model dependencies are non - linear @xcite , but some predictions distinctively different from the ca scenario may be possible as planets loose rather than gain mass as they migrate inwards ."
