    "there are several circumstances where one encounters the functional evolution equation @xcite , @xmath3 corresponding to an abelian flow in the subscript parameter , with initial condition @xmath4 , the identity map .  here",
    ", @xmath5  is functional composition .",
    "for example , such an equation governs the changes in scale that underlie the renormalization group @xcite , or the rectification of local trajectories in dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "while ( [ abelianfe ] ) does give rise to a local differential equation , in principle , the actual problem of interest may instead present the result of a fixed large  step in @xmath6 , say @xmath7 , from which all continuous iterates @xmath8 are to be determined .",
    "in this situation , a useful direct approach is to construct an @xmath9th order formal series approximation for @xmath8 around a fixed point of @xmath7 , say at @xmath10 , by series analysis of the @xmath11 case of ( [ abelianfe ] ) , written as@xmath12 with initial conditions corresponding to @xmath4 , the result has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , so @xmath16 .",
    "note that it is only necessary to construct accurate approximations to @xmath8 for any unit interval in @xmath6 , for then the composition rules @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be used to reach higher or lower values of @xmath6 .",
    "now , for a given @xmath9 the series ( [ nseries ] ) may not produce accurate results for values of @xmath6 , or for an interval of initial @xmath19 , of interest .",
    "quite possibly this may be overcome if the series is convergent , by taking larger @xmath9 , but if the series is only a formal one , perhaps asymptotic , with zero radius of convergence , larger @xmath9 may not be a viable option .",
    "so what can be done then ?    formally , for any fixed @xmath9 , with @xmath20 , it follows that@xmath21 is a solution to ( [ unitstepfe ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of @xmath22 in the limit @xmath23 eqn ( [ unitstepfe ] ) is obtained , _ if _ either of those limits exists .  for a specified class of problems it might be possible to give an elegant proof that either limit exists by using various fixed point theorems from functional analysis @xcite , but that is _ not _ our objective here .",
    "the objective here is to estimate the numerical accuracy obtained by conjugating ( [ nseries ] ) a finite number of times , @xmath24 , with the given , exactly known , finite step  functions @xmath25 .",
    "that is , our concern here is the relative error obtained as a function of @xmath24 , prior to taking the limit @xmath26 .  in many cases , @xmath24-fold conjugation with the given @xmath7 , and its inverse @xmath27 , _ dramatically _",
    "improves the numerical accuracy of the series approximation , with the error vanishing _ exponentially _ in either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "this behavior came to light in follow - up studies of earlier work @xcite .",
    "as a tractable example @xcite , consider@xmath30 in this particular simple case an exact solution to ( [ abelianfe ] ) is @xmath31 but to illustrate the series method , consider ( [ unitstepfe ] ) given only @xmath7 in ( [ x1example ] ) .",
    "recursive analysis in powers of @xmath19 immediately gives @xmath32 , where we have @xmath33 the form and scale of the @xmath34parameterization by the _ choice _",
    "@xmath35 , to be in agreement with ( [ exactexample ] ) .",
    "for instance ,",
    "with @xmath36 we find@xmath37 thus ( [ unitstepfe ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath38 .",
    "so it goes to higher orders in @xmath19 , with each @xmath39 determined by @xmath40 to satisfy ( [ unitstepfe ] )  not just by direct expansion of ( [ exactexample ] ) .",
    "the result for the approximation is therefore@xmath41 then , by @xmath24-fold conjugation of this approximation with @xmath7 and its inverse , obtain@xmath42 this indeed converges to the exact result , ( [ exactexample ] ) , as @xmath26 for any _ fixed _ @xmath43 .  but what is the _ relative error _ for finite @xmath24 ?",
    "since we know the exact answer in this elementary case , this  error is not difficult to compute .  for any fixed @xmath9 and finite @xmath24 the relative error is @xmath44 for @xmath43 this indeed vanishes as @xmath26 , for any fixed @xmath19 , so long as @xmath45 .",
    "however , more importantly , for @xmath24 finite but large compared to both @xmath6 and @xmath46 , this error goes to zero as the @xmath47st power of @xmath24 , @xmath48 therefore , in principle , one can obtain numerical results to any desired accuracy by repeated conjugation of the approximate series with the given step - function @xmath7 .",
    "it is remarkable that it is only required to take any fixed @xmath49 to produce such results , although in practice , as is manifest in ( [ errorexample ] ) , computational efficiencies can be improved by taking larger @xmath9 since the desired accuracy is then reached for smaller @xmath24 .",
    "the result for the relative error can be understood in terms of schrder theory @xcite  as it applies to this simple example .",
    "the continuous iterate @xmath8 given in ( [ exactexample ] ) may be constructed from a schrder function , @xmath50 , and its inverse .  an exact result for this particular example is given by @xcite@xmath51 in schrder s conjugacy framework , the general iterate is @xmath52 , or,@xmath53 thus @xmath54 is just the change of variable that reduces the effect of evolution in @xmath6 to nothing but a multiplicative rescaling , @xmath55 .    but",
    "suppose that the exact @xmath8 were supplanted by an approximation of the form @xmath56 , for some coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58 alternatively , with @xmath59 , @xmath60   \\right )   = \\left (   1+\\frac{\\alpha}{\\left (   -\\ln w_{t}\\right )   ^{n-1}}+o\\left (   \\frac{1}{\\left (   -\\ln w_{t}\\right )   ^{n}}\\right )   \\right )   w_{t}\\ .\\ ] ] then it follows from the multiplicative rescaling behavior of @xmath61 that under the variable change @xmath62 the conjugated approximation @xmath63 presents itself as @xmath64 this gives a relative error with the same power law asymptotics @xcite as ( [ errorexample ] ) , namely , @xmath65 .",
    "a more interesting example is provided by the sine function , where our notation for the continuous iterate is now @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .  in this notation ,",
    "the abelian functional composition equation is@xmath69 again specializing to @xmath11 , written as@xmath70 we find a formal series solution,@xmath71 this is sufficient for the numerical work to follow  ( other results for this example are available online :  http://server.physics.miami.edu/~curtright/schroeder.html[schroeder.html ] & http://server.physics.miami.edu/~curtright/therootsofsin.pdf[therootsofsin.pdf ] ) .    in this case , the series ( [ sineseries ] ) is probably _ not _ convergent for almost all @xmath6 @xcite , although it obviously is convergent for @xmath72 .",
    "rather , for generic @xmath6 the series appears to be asymptotic .",
    "for example , for @xmath73 , using mathematica to extend the series ( [ sineseries ] ) to @xmath74 or so , the smooth behavior of the series coefficients @xmath75 for @xmath76 suggests a finite radius of convergence @xmath77 , as estimated by @xmath78 .",
    "but then less smooth behavior sets in for the @xmath79 and numerical estimates of the radius begin to fall towards zero , as would be expected for an asymptotic series .",
    "also note in passing that ( [ sineseries ] ) implies the corresponding schrder function has an essential singularity at @xmath10 , as given explicitly by @xcite @xmath80 to be compared to ( [ rationalpsi ] ) .",
    "this follows from @xmath81 , using @xmath82 .    nonetheless , the conjugation method produces approximations @xmath83 which provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of a limit , hence an exact result for @xmath84 , as @xmath26 .",
    "but note it is important in this case to take the conjugations to be of the form @xmath85 the general rule being to act first with functions that are _ smaller _ in magnitude than the identity map , thereby leading to evaluation of the truncated series at points closer to @xmath10 .     the improvement wrought by conjugation of the truncated ninth - order series in ( [ sineseries ] )",
    "is easily seen in the following graphs , for the case @xmath73 .",
    "the series itself is not credible beyond @xmath86 , but a single conjugation forces the expected periodicity in @xmath19 , and gives the more plausible green curve seen in the first figure .",
    "repeated conjugation does not produce any discernible differences with the green curve to the accuracy of that first figure , but when the graph is magnified , as it is in the second figure , numerical evidence for convergence of the sequence of conjugations is quite compelling .    proceeding in this way",
    "leads to the set of curves for various values of @xmath6 shown in the following figure .",
    "each of these curves results from the five - fold conjugation @xmath87 of the truncated ninth - order series ( [ sineseries ] ) .",
    "note once again , as previously remarked in a general context , it is only necessary to construct accurate approximations to @xmath84 for any unit interval in @xmath6 , for then the composition rules @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be used to construct the curves for higher or lower values of @xmath6 .",
    "also note from the numerics the obvious inference that @xmath66 becomes the periodic triangular sawtooth  function as @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "fncleqnapproxs3.eps + various @xmath66 as given by five - fold conjugations @xmath92 of the ninth - order series ( [ sineseries ] ) , for @xmath93 .    as constructed , @xmath66 for @xmath94",
    "is guaranteed to be real for all real values of @xmath19 , but certainly it is not obvious for generic @xmath6 what numerical values are actually attained at the extrema for @xmath95 .",
    "it suffices here for us to point out that the maxima are approximated by the simple expression:@xmath96 at least , this is true for @xmath97 , where the relative error between the exact ( numerical ) value of @xmath98 and this approximation is less than about 3 parts per mille .",
    "( more accurate numerics are available http://server.physics.miami.edu/curtright/sinemapiterationextrema.pdf[online ] . )  the branch point at @xmath99 exhibited in this approximate expression is perhaps the most direct numerical evidence that the iterates are _ not _ analytic at @xmath99 for all @xmath19 .",
    "the graphs in the second figure above give a sense of the overall relative error , but lacking closed - form expressions for either the iterates or the conjugations of the series approximations , closed - form results for the error are not available for generic @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath72 , however , precise calculation is indeed possible since both exact results and convergent series are known .",
    "it suffices here to consider just one exact case , @xmath100 .  defining the relative error as before,@xmath101 we have computed numerically the error involved in various conjugations of the ninth - order series .",
    "as previously remarked , conjugation by the sine guarantees the approximations are periodic .",
    "the results are shown here .",
    "fncleqnapproxs4.eps + @xmath102 for @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 , in green , red , and blue , respectively",
    ".    it would be interesting to compute relative errors for other , generic @xmath6 , but at this stage it is only possible for us to compute the _ relative successive differences_,@xmath106 for example , consider @xmath73 using the ninth - order series .",
    "fncleqnapproxs5.eps + @xmath107 for @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 , in green , red , and blue , respectively .",
    "this numerical data supports the proposition that these continuous iterates of the sine function are well - defined and straightforward to compute using the methods in this paper .",
    "the sequence of conjugations converges more rapidly in situations where the underlying schrder function is analytic about the fixed point , in contrast to ( [ rationalpsi ] ) and ( [ sinepsi ] ) .  instead of power law behavior , for such situations the relative error vanishes exponentially in @xmath108 , the number of conjugations .",
    "the general theory is well - illustrated by the logistic map,@xmath109 the result of the theory is the following :    * [ theorem ] *  relative error after @xmath24-fold conjugation of the truncated series ( [ nseries ] ) is given by@xmath110 * [ proof ] *  to sketch a proof , and to see more clearly the assumptions involved , as well as to obtain expressions for @xmath111 , write the truncated series as@xmath112 where @xmath113 represents the exact difference , whose expansion in @xmath19 begins @xmath114 .",

    "moreover , the form in ( [ xsmallremainder ] ) _ suggests _ an approximate scaling law for the error@xmath131 at least for @xmath19 near the origin .",
    "it is interesting to check whether this is true for larger @xmath19 .",

    "are all well - behaved enough for the steps in the proof of the theorem to be valid for @xmath137 .",
    "however , at the upper end of the interval , @xmath138 , some additional consideration is needed .",
    "the expression in ( [ epsilondefn ] ) is @xmath139 at @xmath140 , independent of @xmath6 and @xmath24 , and therefore _ not _ small .",
    "that is to say , at @xmath140 the @xmath141 prefactor in @xmath142 is not present to suppress the error .  on the other hand",
    ", the ratio @xmath143 in ( [ difference ] ) , and in ( [ remainder ] ) , always vanishes at @xmath140 , for any @xmath6 ,  so the leading contribution to the relative error is actually zero at that point .",
    "thus the upper end of the @xmath19 interval does not pose a problem after all .",
    "in fact , as is evident in the graphs to follow , or by direct calculation , the maximum magnitude of the leading contribution to @xmath144 occurs for @xmath137 , for which the @xmath141 prefactor is present .    putting all this together for the @xmath132 logistic map , the leading approximation to the relative error is@xmath145 for comparison purposes , we plot this last expression for various @xmath9 and @xmath24 , and selected @xmath6 , especially to check ( [ scalinglaw ] ) , for @xmath146  that scaling law is seen to be hold fairly well , even for @xmath147 .     finally , we note there is no discernible difference , to the accuracy of this last plot , between the leading approximations and the exact results for the relative error as computed from ( [ 2exact ] ) and the @xmath148- , @xmath105- , and @xmath149-fold conjugations of @xmath150 .",
    "the largest of these differences , between the exact and the leading approximation of the relative error for @xmath151 , is shown next .",
    "so , the exact relative errors are essentially indistinguishable from their leading approximations , at least for @xmath132 and @xmath73 & @xmath152 , and the relative error after @xmath149 conjugations of the @xmath148th order series is always less than @xmath153 parts in @xmath154 for these two values of @xmath6 .",
    "other values of @xmath6 taken from the unit interval @xmath155   $ ] are similarly well - approximated by the combined series and conjugation methods .",
    "more or less the same results can be obtained for other values of @xmath156 as well , but only for one other case , namely @xmath157 , is it possible to compare to exact , closed - form results .",
    "by combining series approximations with functional conjugations , accurate representations of continuous functional iterates were obtained for selected rational , sine , and logistic maps , and relative errors were estimated .",
    "these examples illustrate both the simplicity and the power of the methods .  although the rational and sine examples have more singular underpinnings ( their schrder functions have essential singularities ) than the selected logistic map ( whose schrder function  is analytic ) , nevertheless , the same methods work well for all three cases",
    ".     this should be true for many other examples .  indeed",
    ", it would appear to be a relatively straightforward task to construct accurate approximations for the continuous iterations of _ all _ the classical special functions .",
    "many of these , like the sine iterates depicted above , are expected to exhibit smooth , intuitive iterations that are easy to grasp , conceptually .",
    "others , such as occur for the logistic map when the parameter leads to chaotic behavior , are expected to lead to much more exotic iterations .  despite the long history of and voluminous literature on functional equations ( see @xcite for history and bibliographies ) , the full landscape of features to be encountered is still largely unexplored , in our opinion .",
    "perhaps the methods elucidated in this paper will help to continue that exploration .",
    "@xmath158  _ we thank david fairlie and andrzej veitia for discussions related to this research .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for asking a question which led us to obtain ( [ approxmax ] ) .  this work was supported in part by nsf award 0855386 , and in part by the u.s .",

    "_                                    this result is for a particular choice ( namely , @xmath159 ) of the multiplier  in schrder s equation , @xmath160 .",
    "the multiplier is undetermined when @xmath161 is zero , or undefined , for all @xmath24 .  in such cases",
    "it is usually possible to choose @xmath156 just as a matter of taste .    when @xmath162 is analytic about @xmath10 , with @xmath163 and real @xmath164 , there is a solution of schrder s equation which is also analytic , with @xmath165 .",
    "under the exact change of variables given by @xmath166 the series approximation @xmath167 therefore becomes @xmath168 for some coefficient @xmath169 , where @xmath170 , while the exact @xmath171 become @xmath172 .",
    "so under this change of variables the conjugation @xmath173 presents itself as @xmath174 this gives a relative error @xmath175 which vanishes _ exponentially _ in @xmath24 , either as @xmath176 for @xmath177 , or as @xmath178 for@xmath179 .",
    "thus , for such analytic @xmath50 cases , the conjugations would converge more rapidly to the exact result than for the rational and sine examples discussed in the text .  for a thorough discussion of an analytic case , with @xmath180 , see  iv in the text ."
