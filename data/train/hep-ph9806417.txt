    "the purpose of the first chapter is to set the stage for light by light scattering within the context of the effective action approach .",
    "the original investigations can be retraced to the work of the authors listed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will present a method which is more in the spirit of schwinger s paper @xcite .",
    "essentially all we need in order to discuss photon - photon scattering is the expression for the vacuum persistence amplitude ,    @xmath0    the index 0 appended to the action indicates that no external charged particles are in evidence , while the index 4 corresponds to the two incoming and outgoing photons .",
    "although the amplitude ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be evaluated ( with some effort ) for any photon energy and without restriction to the polarization of the incoming and outgoing photons , we want to limit ourselves to low - energy photons .",
    "the generally non - local photon - photon interaction becomes inevitably local and the vacuum amplitude ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be expressed as a space - time integral of a local lagrange function .",
    "in particular the choice of parallel ( @xmath1 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath2 ) polarizations of the initial photons and of the final photons ( the polarization vectors of the photons do not change in the low - energy collision process ) yield the following amplitude :    @xmath3    with    @xmath4    and    @xmath5    expression ( [ 1.3]-[1.4 ] ) is easily recognized as the weak field lagrange function as obtained from the original renormalized heisenberg - euler ( h .- e . )",
    "lagrangian ,    @xmath6 . \\label{1.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    expression ( [ 1.5 ] ) is the result of a one - loop calculation with external electromagnetic fields tied to all orders to the circulating electron loop .",
    "we can make contact to our former weak - field result ( [ 1.3]-[1.4 ] ) by expanding the integrand of ( [ 1.5 ] ) according to    @xmath7    where    @xmath8    after performance of the integral in ( [ 1.5 ] ) , the effective low - energy lagrangian ( [ 1.3]-[1.4 ] ) emerges ; we rewrite it in the form    @xmath9    superimposed is the free maxwell lagrangian so that in the limit of slowly varying fields , the total effective lagrangian function reads :    @xmath10    where    @xmath11    we shall use the information contained in ( [ 1.9 ] ) to exhibit the nonlinear features of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "for this reason we compute    @xmath12    which produces the electric and magnetic permeability tensors of the vacuum @xcite :    @xmath13 \\label{1.14}\\\\ \\mu_{ik}&=&\\delta_{ik}+\\frac{4\\alpha^2}{45m^4 } \\bigl [ 2({\\bf b}^2 -{\\bf e}^2 ) \\delta_{ik } + 7e_ie_k \\bigr]\\ , .",
    "\\label{1.15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these quantities recall the original qed - lagrangian in which the heavy degrees of freedom , in our case the electron fields , have been integrated out so as to leave behind small non - linear corrections to the linear maxwell lagrangian , causing interactions between electromagnetic fields .",
    "it is precisely this phenomenon which we want to investigate in the sequel by studying the behavior of a plane wave field ( laser light ) in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "now we want to analyze dispersion effects in the low - frequency limit , i.e. , we want to study the propagation of electrodynamic waves , e.g. , laser photons , in the presence of an external prescribed @xmath14-field . for this case",
    "it is sufficient to consider the lagrangian of the previous chapter :    @xmath15\\ , .\\label{2.1}\\ ] ]    since we assume our background field to be purely magnetic , we decompose @xmath16 and @xmath14 according to    @xmath17    @xmath18 denote the plane wave field , while @xmath19 is the applied constant magnetic field .",
    "the constitutive equations are given by    @xmath20    linearizing these equations with respect to the wave fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we find that    @xmath23    where    @xmath24    with @xmath25 the applied field direction",
    ".    since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants in this linear approximation , we may write the source - free maxwell equations as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 denotes the direction of propagation of the plane wave field .",
    "now it is convenient to distinguish between two polarization modes where either @xmath21 ( @xmath2-mode ) or @xmath30 ( @xmath1-mode ) points along the direction perpendicular to the plane containing the external magnetic field and the wave propagation direction , ( @xmath31)-plane . then there exist two corresponding refractive indices @xmath32 , which are displayed in the following together with their respective eigenmodes :    @xmath33    in both eigenmodes , the plane wave field is linearly polarized .",
    "we also see from ( [ 2.10],[2.11 ] ) that , except for propagation along the external field direction ( @xmath34 ) , the vacuum polarized by an external constant magnetic field acts like a birefringent medium @xcite .",
    "all the calculations performed so far have employed the lowest - order h .- e .",
    "lagrangian ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "however , we can improve on our previous results concerning the permeability tensors @xmath35 and the refractive indices by taking into account virtual photon radiative corrections to the original electron loop graph .",
    "this additional order-@xmath36 correction yields in the weak - field limit @xcite :    @xmath37\\ , , \\label{2.12}\\\\ & & \\frac{ee}{m^2}\\ll 1\\ , , \\quad\\ , \\frac{eb}{m^2}\\ll 1\\ , .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression , together with ( [ 2.1 ] ) , leads to a modified h .-",
    "effective lagrangian :    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    the results obtained in ( [ 1.14],[1.15 ] ) now become altered into    @xmath41    and the @xmath42 are changed according to @xmath43 :    @xmath44",
    "in this chapter we want to compute the index of refraction to all orders in the strong external field .",
    "however , we will be confining ourselves to low - frequency photons and neglecting virtual radiative corrections .",
    "the corresponding process can be viewed as a single virtual electron loop with two photon vertices and an arbitrary number of interactions with the external field .",
    "vacuum polarization generated by external c - number fields can best be attacked by schwinger s proper - time method @xcite .",
    "it is exactly this strategy that s. adler pursues in appendix i of his paper @xcite .",
    "here it becomes necessary to find an explicit expression for the current density @xmath45 induced in the vacuum by the background field @xmath46    @xmath47\\ , .\\ ] ]    the electron green s function in presence of the external field @xmath48 is given by    @xmath49 g(x , x'|a ) = \\delta(x - x')\\ , .\\ ] ]    thus , what is needed to calculate the induced vacuum current is the green s function .",
    "since this is outlined in adler s and schwinger s work , we just refer the reader to their papers  having in mind still another way to proceed , which will take up an appreciable fraction of the present chapter .",
    "it is well known that one can include vacuum polarization effects by modifying the original maxwell lagrangian according to    @xmath50    where @xmath51 denotes the photon polarization tensor which describes the effect of the vacuum induced by the external field . from ( [ 3.1 ] )",
    "we obtain the modified maxwell equations ; in momentum representation ( @xmath52 is now replaced by @xmath53 ) ,    @xmath54 a^\\nu ( k ) = 0\\ , .\\label{3.2}\\ ] ]    without loss of generality we choose the @xmath14-field in @xmath55-direction ; @xmath56 is taken in the @xmath57-@xmath55 plane .",
    "the photon polarization vector @xmath58 can be resolved into    @xmath59    corresponding to the direction parallel and perpendicular to the plane containing @xmath56 and @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath14 ; then we have    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    if we now decompose @xmath63 in ( [ 3.2 ] ) according to    @xmath64    and multiply equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) from the left by ( @xmath65 ) , we can easily show that the matrix elements of @xmath66 between @xmath67 and @xmath68 are zero , while the diagonal elements in ( @xmath69)-space to be considered are    @xmath70    the original light cone condition for the freely propagating photon , @xmath71 , is then modified according to    @xmath72    which opens the way to discussing the vacuum as a non - linear responding medium .    for a given frequency of the real photon , @xmath73 , we obtain from ( [ 3.7 ] )    @xmath74    the complex index of refraction is defined by    @xmath75    we are interested in the real part of this equation which corresponds to the index of refraction :    @xmath76    in view of the restriction to soft laser photons , we have no interest in the imaginary part , @xmath77im@xmath78 , which is related to the absorption coefficient ,    @xmath79    hence we will stay in the realm below pair creation ( @xmath80 ) , where the polarization operator @xmath81 must be real .",
    "now we turn to the evaluation of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is at this stage that we make substantial use of the explicit representation for the polarization ( mass- ) operator @xmath66 as outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath81 can be performed by implementing the special field configuration as indicated in ( [ 3.4],[3.5 ] ) .",
    "this then yields the following parametric integrals :",
    "@xmath84    where @xmath85 and    @xmath86    incidentally , these expressions for @xmath87 coincide with adler s @xmath88 .    in the sequel",
    "we need the expansions for @xmath87 for @xmath89 :    @xmath90    therefore , in the low - frequency @xmath91 and weak - field @xmath92 limit we obtain    @xmath93 . \\label{3.17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so , indeed , @xmath81 turns out to be purely real and the corresponding refractive indices are given by    @xmath94 . \\label{3.18}\\ ] ]    for @xmath95 , i.e. , for the photon beam orthogonal to the @xmath14-field , we have    @xmath96 . \\label{3.19}\\ ] ]    hence , with only one - loop calculation we obtain    @xmath97    in particular , if we consider light of wavelength @xmath98 traversing a path length @xmath99 normal to the @xmath14-field , then the angular rotation of the plane of polarization is given by    @xmath100    with two - loop corrections we obtain with the aid of ( [ 2.15 ] )    @xmath101    and ( [ 3.21 ] ) becomes modified according to    @xmath102    it is the formidable task of the pvlas experiment to detect and measure this small angular rotation @xcite .",
    "last of all we study the limiting case of very low - energy photons in the external constant magnetic field of arbitrary strength .",
    "since we are again in the region below pair creation ( @xmath103 ; also @xmath104 ) , we can employ the polarization operator @xmath81 of ( [ 3.12 ] ) and obtain for the index of refraction    @xmath105    @xmath106    with @xmath87 given in ( [ 3.13 ] ) and ( [ 3.14 ] ) .",
    "the integrals can be done and lead to    @xmath107    where    @xmath108    @xmath109 stands for @xmath110 , @xmath111 denotes the logarithmic derivative of the @xmath112-function , and @xmath113 is the derivative of the hurwitz zeta - function .",
    "plots of @xmath114 as well as of @xmath115 are given in the enclosed figures .",
    "let us recall that for weak electromagnetic fields we found within the context of the h .- e .",
    "lagrangian ( [ 2.10],[2.11 ] ) :                  now , the authors of ref.@xcite claim that the velocity shift ( [ 4.3 ] ) holds for any ( renormalized ) background energy density  not just electromagnetic  with the same , i.e. , universal coefficient as in ( [ 4.3 ] ) ,          it might even be possible to produce faster than light signals , e.g. , in curved space - time manifolds or in casimir configurations , where we can generate velocity shifts @xmath123 , since these cases allow for negative energy densities .",
    "however , as we are solely interested in external electromagnetic fields , we will not go into further details concerning those other non - trivial qed vacua @xcite .",
    "but already in the context of pure qed we might ask whether the coefficients in ( [ 4.3 ] ) or ( [ 4.4 ] ) are really universal or whether they are but a reflection of any weak field approach based on the h .- e . lagrangian . to answer this question we are now going to introduce yet another method to set up the light cone condition . instead of making the electromagnetic vacuum current @xcite or the polarization operator @xcite our starting point",
    ", we want to work entirely within the effective lagrangian approach . here",
    "the relevant relation turns out to be @xcite                            since the @xmath128-factor depends on all variables and parameters of @xmath133 , it will naturally be neither universal nor constant . for the applications we have in mind , @xmath128 will simplify substantially so that after averaging over propagation directions , we have for @xmath134 :                at this stage we want to emphasize that the result ( [ 4.15 ] ) which expresses the energy - momentum tensor in terms of the velocity shifts @xmath139 is strictly limited to our former weak - field approximation and hence does not hold in general @xcite .                    hence in the one - loop part of ( [ 4.20 ] ) we can identify the factor @xmath144 as the universal constant of the `` unified formula '' ( [ 4.4 ] ) .",
    "however , the two - loop correction in ( [ 4.20 ] ) destroys this universality : @xmath145 is as universal as 11 .",
