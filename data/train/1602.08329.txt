    "the experimental technique of trapped one - dimensional atomic gases @xcite has now become a fundamental tool for revealing nontrivial effects in quantum many - body systems @xcite . for the interacting bose gas in one dimension ( 1d ) , the first set of exact results goes back to the pioneering work of girardeau @xcite on the impenetrable bose gas where the strong interacting limit is considered .",
    "the 1d bose gas interacting with the delta - function potentials , i.e. the lieb - liniger ( ll ) model , gives a solvable model for interacting bosons in 1d @xcite , where it is integrable even when the interaction parameter is generic .",
    "for the impenetrable bose gas which corresponds to the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit , i.e. the strong interacting limit of the ll model , the one - body reduced density matrix is derived and successfully expressed in terms of the determinant of a fredholm operator @xcite .",
    "the exact result is followed by several important developments in mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dynamical correlation functions of the ll model are now systematically derived @xcite .",
    "soliton - like localized excitations in a periodic 1d bose gas have attracted much interest recently and have been studied theoretically @xcite . here",
    "we remark that dark solitons are created experimentally in cold atoms @xcite , for instance , by the phase - imprinting method @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "localized quantum states are important for investigating dynamical responses of interacting quantum systems .",
    "quantum dark solitons in confining potentials are studied by semiclassical quantization @xcite , and those in thermal equilibrium of a quasi-1d bose gas by generating classical field ensembles @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear even at zero temperature how we can construct quantum states associated with dark solitons in the many - body system of the ll model .",
    "let us consider the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which describes bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "we also call it the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the gp equation has dark soliton solutions for the repulsive interactions , while it has bright soliton solutions for the attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured that dark solitons are closely related to lieb s type - ii excitations , i.e. one - hole excitations , by carefully studying the dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relations of the ll model are briefly compared with those of the classical nonlinear schrdinger equation in the weak coupling limit @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been shown how one can construct such a quantum state that leads to a dark soliton in the classical limit or what kind of physical quantity can show a property of a dark soliton for some quantum state . here",
    "we remark that each of the type - ii eigenstates has a flat density profile since the bethe ansatz eigenstates are translationally invariant .",
    "moreover , we consider dark solitons under the periodic boundary conditions , which are expressed in terms of elliptic functions @xcite .    in this paper we demonstrate that a quantum state derived from the bethe ansatz eigenvectors of the ll model by taking the fourier transform of the type - ii excitations over a branch @xcite has many aspects closely related to classical dark solitons of the gp equation under the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we call the state the _ quantum dark soliton state _ and a classical dark soliton under the periodic boundary conditions simply a _ classical dark soliton_. through the bethe ansatz we show several corresponding aspects in the weak coupling regime .",
    "firstly , the density profile of the quantum dark soliton state at an initial time is consistent with that of a classical dark soliton .",
    "here we call the graph of the expectation value of the local density operator for a given state versus the position coordinate the density profile of the state , and for a quantum dark soliton state",
    "we simply call it the density profile of quantum dark soliton ; we call the graphs of the square amplitude and phase in the complex scalar field of a classical dark soliton versus the position coordinate the density profile and phase profile of classical dark soliton , respectively . secondly , in time evolution the density profile of quantum dark soliton coincides with that of the corresponding classical dark soliton over the whole graph and they move together with the same velocity for a long period of time . thirdly , for the matrix element of the bosonic field operator between two quantum dark soliton states where one state has @xmath0 particles and another @xmath1 particles , the profiles of the square amplitude and phase at the initial time graphically agree with those of classical dark soliton , respectively . in time",
    "evolution the profiles of square amplitude and phase overlap with those of classical dark soliton , respectively , over the whole region and the corresponding profiles move together in time for a long period of time . here",
    "we remark that a classical dark soliton parametrized by elliptic functions becomes a standard dark soliton with open boundaries by simultaneously sending the system size to infinity and the elliptic modulus to unity .",
    "furthermore , in order to illustrate the method for constructing quantum dark solitons , in the 1d free fermions we show from the anti - commutation relations that a notch appears in the density profile of some superposition of one - hole excitations .",
    "interestingly , the density profile of the fermionic state coincides with that of quantum dark soliton for the 1d bose gas in the large coupling case , i.e. near the tg limit , not only at an initial time but also during the quantum dynamics for some period of time",
    ".    the time evolution of the expectation value of the local density operator in the 1d bose gas should be important also from the renewed interest on the fundamentals of quantum statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the density profile of a quantum dark soliton state has initially a localized notch but collapses slowly to a flat profile in time evolution @xcite .",
    "the relaxation behavior is consistent with the viewpoints of equilibration of an isolated quantum system @xcite and thermalization due to the typicality of quantum states @xcite .",
    "we now argue that the density profile of quantum dark soliton has a finite lifetime but it is much longer than the quantum speed limit time of the quantum state in the weak coupling case . here",
    "we remark that the lifetime of a generic state is given by the quantum speed limit time for it @xcite . by observing the exact time evolution of the density profile of quantum dark soliton",
    "we estimate its lifetime .",
    "we shall show in section 5 that the observed life time is inversely proportional to the coupling constant .",
    "we thus suggest that the localized density profile of a quantum dark soliton is much more stable than the density profile of a generic quantum state in the weak coupling case . here",
    "we remark that girardeau and wright discussed a permanent quantum soliton for impenetrable bosons in 1d @xcite , which corresponds to the infinite coupling case of the ll model .",
    "we also argue that the behavior of the wavefunctions is nontrivial in the weak coupling limit for the ll model .",
    "the wavefunctions do not simply become close to such wavefunctions of the 1d free bosons that could be consistent with the mean - field picture , when the coupling constant approaches zero but it takes a nonzero value .",
    "the exact bethe ansatz wavefunctions consist of a large number of terms such as @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we can show that many - body correlations increase if we increase the particle number @xmath1 while we keep the coupling constant small but fixed and the particle density constant .",
    "for instance , the zero mode fraction in the ground state of the 1d bose gas , which we regard as the condensate fraction of bec , becomes small and decreases to zero if the number of particles increases while the coupling constant and the particle density are fixed @xcite .",
    "we suggest that it is also the case for quantum dark solitons i.e. , that some properties of quantum dark solitons corresponding to classical dark solitons do not necessarily hold if we increase the particle number @xmath1 while we keep the coupling constant small but fixed and the density of particles fixed .",
    "in fact , it is not _ a priori _ clear how valid the mean - field approximation is for quantum dark solitons even in the weak coupling case . here",
    "we remark that the breakdown of mean - field theory is addressed for impenetrable bosons @xcite , and a long - wavelength theory beyond the mean - field approximation is discussed for low - dimensional bose liquids @xcite .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of the ll model for @xmath1 bosons with coupling constant @xmath3 @xmath4 here we impose periodic boundary conditions with length @xmath5 .",
    "we employ a system of units with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the particle mass .",
    "we introduce the canonical bose field operator @xmath8 with the commutation relations @xcite @xmath9=\\delta(x - x ' ) , \\\\ & [ \\hat { \\psi}(x , t ) , \\hat { \\psi}(x',t)]=[\\hat { \\psi}^{\\dagger}(x , t ) , \\hat { \\psi}^{\\dagger}(x',t)]=0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second - quantized hamiltonian of the ll model is written in terms of the field operator @xmath8 as @xmath10 ,    \\label{h2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the chemical potential .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion of this system has the form @xmath12    in the classical limit where the quantum field operator @xmath8 is replaced by a complex @xmath3-number field @xmath13 , equation ( [ eq : qnse ] ) becomes the following partial differential equation @xmath14 we call it the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : nse ] ) can be solved by the inverse scattering method and has soliton solutions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that it has dark soliton solutions for the repulsive interactions @xmath15 , while it has bright soliton solutions for the attractive interactions @xmath16 . for the attractive case ,",
    "bright solitons are analytically derived from the quantum wave packets constructed through the fourier transform of the bound states @xcite .",
    "the construction was extended for optical fibers @xcite .",
    "time evolution of quantum states of bright solitons was investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the effect of quantum noises on the quantum states of bright solitons was also studied @xcite .",
    "the contents of the paper consists of the following . in section 2 we briefly introduce the notation for the bethe ansatz , characterize the type ii excitation branch , and then construct quantum dark soliton states .",
    "we argue that the structure of quantum dark soliton states is analogous to the dirichlet kernel , and show for free fermions that the density profile of a superposition of one - hole excited states has a notch .",
    "it illustrates the construction of quantum dark soliton states . in section 3",
    "we derive one - soliton solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nse ] ) under the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we express the classical dark solitons in terms of elliptic functions similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite . by sending the elliptic modulus @xmath17 to 1 ,",
    "the classical dark solitons under the periodic boundary conditions become the standard classical dark solitons of the nonlinear schrdinger equation with open boundaries . furthermore , we calculate the logarithmic corrections to them , in particular , to the chemical potential and the soliton velocity , by which we can confirm the numerical estimates of the soliton parameters shown in section 4 at least approximately . in section 4 we show several corresponding aspects between the quantum dark soliton states and the corresponding classical dark solitons , which hold in the weak coupling case and should be rigorously valid when the coupling constant approaches zero with the density and the particle number @xmath1 fixed .",
    "firstly , we show that the density profile of quantum dark soliton at an initial time is consistent with that of classical dark soliton .",
    "secondly , we show that in exact time evolution the density profile of quantum dark soliton as a whole coincides with that of classical dark soliton for a long period of time .",
    "thirdly , we show that both the square amplitude and phase profiles for the matrix element of the quantum field operator @xmath18 in the ll model between the quantum dark soliton states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles overlap with those of classical dark soliton , respectively , all over the profiles . the square amplitude and phase profiles move in time evolution with exactly the same speed as those of classical dark soliton , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we remark that the density profile of a sum of one - hole excitations in the 1d free fermions overlap with that of quantum dark soliton in the 1d bose gas with the large coupling constant , i.e. in a regime close to the tg limit . for the matrix element of the fermionic field operator between two such fermionic states the square amplitude and phase profiles have several features in common with those of quantum dark soliton in the 1d bose gas for the large coupling case , respectively , although they do not overlap each other .",
    "we thus obtain useful tools to describe approximately the profiles of quantum dark soliton in the large coupling case . however , it is still quite nontrivial that the profiles of quantum dark soliton in the weak coupling case are consistent with those of classical dark soliton . in section 5",
    "we argue that the lifetime of a notch in the density profile of quantum dark soliton is much longer than that of a generic state when the coupling constant @xmath3 is very small .",
    "we compare the lifetime of a notch in the density profile of quantum dark soliton with the quantum speed limit time , and show that the ratio of the former to the latter increases as the coupling constant decreases .",
    "it becomes infinitely large as the coupling constant approaches zero .",
    "thus , although the localized density profile collapses in time evolution , we call the quantum states quantum dark soliton states .",
    "in the framework of the bethe ansatz method , the bethe ansatz wavefunction which is expressed in terms of quasi - momenta @xmath19 @xmath20 , \\nn\\db & a_\\sg=(-1)^\\sg \\prod_{j>\\ell}^n\\[k_{\\sg_j}-k_{\\sg_\\ell}-\\i c \\ , \\sign(x_j - x_\\ell)\\ ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gives an eigenstate of the ll model , if the quasi - momenta satisfy the bethe ansatz equations @xmath21 in the logarithmic form , we have @xmath22 here @xmath23 s are integers for odd @xmath1 and half - odd integers for even @xmath1 .",

    "the configuration of the bethe quantum numbers for the ground state is given by the regular array around the center : @xmath29 it is depicted in the top panel of figure [ ij1h1p ] ( a ) in the case of @xmath30 .",
    "we can construct low - lying excited states systematically by putting holes and placing particles in the regular array of the bethe quantum numbers for the case of the ground state .",
    "the arrays of the bethe quantum numbers for one - hole excitations are shown in the second panel of figure [ ij1h1p ] ( a ) . in each sequence there",
    "exists an unoccupied number in the middle of the sequence of the five red circles , which we call the one - hole .",
    "we remark that the one - hole excitations are also called the type ii excitations @xcite .",
    "similarly as in the second panel , the arrays of the bethe quantum numbers for one - particle excitations are shown in the third panel of figure [ ij1h1p ] ( a ) .",
    "the right most red particle corresponds to the one - particle in each array .",
    "the one - particle excitations are also called the type i excitations @xcite .",

    "we now explain how we construct a series of quantum states @xcite through the type ii excitations .",

    "the formal structure of quantum dark soliton states is analogous to a truncated series of the delta function . for periodic functions with period @xmath5 the delta function",
    "is expressed in the form of an infnite series @xmath41 we now truncate it by keeping only such terms with integers @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 @xmath44 it is called the dirichlet kernel in the fourier series analysis .",

    "<S> we show corresponding aspects between the states and the solitons in the weak coupling case : the quantum and classical density profiles completely overlap with each other not only at an initial time but also at later times over a long period of time , and they move together with the same speed in time ; the matrix element of the bosonic field operator between the quantum states has exactly the same profiles of the square amplitude and the phase as the classical complex scalar field of a classical dark soliton not only at the initial time but also at later times , and the corresponding profiles move together for a long period of time . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the corresponding properties hold rigorously in the weak coupling limit . furthermore , we argue that the lifetime of the dark soliton - like density profile in the quantum state becomes infinitely long as the coupling constant approaches zero , by comparing it with the quantum speed limit time . </S>",
