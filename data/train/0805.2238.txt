    "it is widely accepted that the effect of environment is one of the most important factors for galaxy evolution . unlike field galaxies for which the dominant physical mechanism driving evolution is galaxy - galaxy mergers ,",
    "as has been revealed in many large - scale surveys @xcite , cluster galaxies evolve in a more complex fashion ( see , e.g. , the review by @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "cluster galaxies behave differently from field galaxies at the same epoch .",
    "one of the best - studied examples of this difference between the properties of galaxies in clusters and in the field is the morphology - density relation@xcite , i.e. , the fact that the fraction of late - type galaxies drops precipitously toward the center of a cluster , whereas the fraction of early - type galaxies increases dramatically .",
    "in addition , the butcher - oemler effect@xcite , which states that galaxies in rich clusters tend to be bluer and more active ( i.e.  feature emission lines ) with increasing cluster redshift out to at least @xmath5 0.8 , implies that the build - up of the morphology - density relation is still ongoing at redshifts less than unity .",
    "therefore , much effort @xcite has gone into establishing whether and , if so , how blue late - type galaxies are transformed into early - type galaxies , specifically s0 galaxies .",
    "clusters at intermediate redshift ( @xmath6 ) provide us with a unique opportunity to examine this hypothesized transformation as well as the dominant physical mechanisms driving it .",
    "recent work in this field includes a study of the morphological distribution of galaxies in the cluster cl0024 + 16 at @xmath7 @xcite , and a comparison of the spatial distribution and spectroscopic properties of spiral galaxies with quenched star formation ( passive spirals ) and newly formed s0 galaxies in , again cl0024 + 16 , as well as in the more massive system ms0451.60305 at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the authors of these studies suggest that ram - pressure stripping @xcite is not the only mechanism involved in building up the population of s0 galaxies from late - type galaxies , although it does accelerate the process . the transformation is actually initiated much farther away from the cluster center , and at a slower pace , by the processes of strangulation @xcite or galaxy - galaxy harassment @xcite .",
    "additional evidence of this evolution from blue late - type galaxies to s0 galaxies is presented by @xcite who , using the spectroscopic diagnostics h@xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite in their study of the cluster ms1054.40321 ( @xmath11 ) , confirms that s0 galaxies in the cluster are , in general , younger than the elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that these s0 galaxies have recently been converted from late - type galaxies falling in from the field ( see also @xcite ) .    to improve our understanding of the different physical effects governing galaxy evolution from the cluster outskirts to the cluster core",
    ", we have embarked on an extensive magnitude - limited wide - field spectroscopic survey of the galaxy population of 12 clusters with redshifts above @xmath12 , selected from the massive cluster survey ( macs ) @xcite . in this paper we present results from our pilot study of macsj0717.5 + 3745 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "macsj0717.5 + 3745 , which has the most extensive spectroscopic data set of these 12 at present , features a complex x - ray morphology in the cluster core as well as a giant filament described by @xcite .",
    "we here focus on the spectroscopic analysis and classification of galaxies in macsj0717.5 + 3745 , with special emphasis on e+a galaxies , a galaxy type that , as shall be explained in the following section , holds great promise as a diagnostic for cluster - related mechanisms of galaxy evolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we review the properties of e+a galaxies . in  3 , we describe the data used for this study and give an overview of the data reduction procedure . in ",
    "4 we discuss the selection of the cluster members used in our analysis , and describe the equivalent - width measurement and spectral classification . in  5 , we present results based on the spatial distribution of each spectral type of galaxies . in ",
    "6 we interpret our findings ; a conclusion is given in  7 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the concordance @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "magnitudes are quoted in the ab system .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to understanding how blue and active late - type galaxies are transformed into red and passive early - type systems @xcite is through studies of galaxies caught in transition between the two types , for example e+a galaxies @xcite , also called k+a , a+k , or post - starburst galaxies .",
    "although there is no unique definition of this transition type , its representatives are characterized by the presence of strong balmer absorption lines in their spectra , indicating a large fraction of a - type stars , and weak or no ongoing star formation , often quantified by the strength of the [ oii ] emission line .",
    "since the duration of the e+a phase is relatively short ( less than 1 gyr ) e+a galaxies should be good tracers of the environment that is host to a critical part of the evolution of galaxies in clusters .",
    "although e+a galaxies were first found in clusters at intermediate redshift ( e.g. , dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 ) , their origin and habitat was soon proven to be more varied by the discovery that the majority of e+a galaxies in the local universe are in fact not located in dense environments @xcite .",
    "as for the possible physical origin of this type of galaxies , @xcite and @xcite report that many of the e+a galaxies in the field show evidence of galaxy mergers . at higher redshift , however , e+a galaxies are predominantly found in the much denser environment of clusters @xcite , which have thus been suspected of being instrumental in the termination of star - formation activity in these systems .",
    "in addition , @xcite show that , at m@xmath18 , the post - starburst galaxies in coma are fainter than the typical e+a galaxies found in clusters at higher redshift , which suggests that the evolution of post - starburst galaxies follows the `` downsizing '' trend proposed by @xcite .",
    "any discrepancies between the properties of e+a galaxies in the local field and in intermediate - redshift clusters may thus be explained by the combination of evolution and selection biases , in the sense that the local surveys sample predominantly luminous galaxies and hence do not probe the population of fainter e+a galaxies in clusters ( the faintest e+a galaxy in @xcite features m@xmath19 , whereas the magnitude limit in @xcite is m@xmath20 ) .    unlike previous studies @xcite , the goal of this work is not the issue of whether e+a galaxies are more likely to be found in clusters or in the field ; rather , we focus on the spatial distribution of e+a galaxies around the massive cluster macsj0717.5 + 3745 to isolate the most probable physical mechanism responsible for their creation in a cluster environment . in this context",
    "we also attempt to address the question of the origin of the e+a population by investigating the spatial distribution of possible star - burst galaxies , the so - called e(a ) and e(b ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "using optical images obtained with the suprime - cam wide - field camera on the subaru 8 m telescope on mauna kea @xcite , we identify galaxies within the @xmath21 arcmin@xmath22 suprime - cam field of view .",
    "we then employ color selection to obtain spectra of a subset of presumed cluster members , primarily using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ) on the keck - ii 10 m telescope . in order to study the spectroscopic properties of galaxies in different environments ,",
    "the deimos masks are designed to cover the entire cluster including the filament and a satellite cluster .",
    "we use the spectroscopic data to determine the redshift of galaxies , as well as their spectral types .",
    "we follow the spectral classification scheme of @xcite ( with some modifications ) to categorize the cluster galaxies into emission - line , absorption - line , and e+a galaxies .",
    "the emission - line galaxies can be further subdivided into e(a ) , e(b ) , and e(c ) galaxies according to the equivalent width of the h@xmath9 absorption and [ oii ] emission lines @xcite . complementing our optical analysis of the galaxy population of this system , x - ray data obtained with the imaging array of the chandra advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) are analyzed to provide a basic model of the gaseous intracluster medium .",
    "we use images in the b , v , r@xmath23 , i@xmath23 , and z@xmath24 bands obtained with suprime - cam , supplemented by images in the u@xmath25 band obtained with the megaprime camera on the cfht 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the observations were performed from december 2000 to february 2004 .",
    "all data are reduced employing standard techniques , which have , however , been adapted to deal with the special characteristics of the suprime - cam and megaprime data ; details are given by @xcite .    in order to allow a robust estimate of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to be obtained for all objects within the field of view",
    ", the imaging data from the various passbands are seeing - matched using the technique described in @xcite ; this ensures that the images for all bands have the same effective spatial resolution of 1@xmath26 .",
    "object catalogues are then created with sextractor version 2.4.3@xcite in `` dual image '' mode with the r - band image as the reference detection image .",
    "we separate stars from galaxies by fitting the stellar sequence in the distributions of magnitude vs peak surface - brightness , and magnitude vs half - light radius .",
    "isophotal galaxy magnitudes calculated for elliptical apertures are returned by sextractor in the mag_auto parameter .",
    "the photometric calibration of the suprime - cam imaging data is performed by means of a snapshot observation of a nearby sdss field and uses hundreds of stars with magnitudes ranging from 16 mag to 18 mag .",

    "the x - ray data are used to derive global cluster properties , most importantly the virial radius and the ram - pressure stripping radius . to this end",

    "in addition , some spectra obtained using the low resolution image spectrometer ( lris ) on the keck - i telescope , and the gemini multi - object spectrographs ( gmos ) on the gemini telescope are included .",
    "the instrumental configuration of these observations is summarized by @xcite , from where we have extracted the essential information listed in table  [ spectdata ] .",
    "the chosen setup is a compromise between the requirements of wavelength coverage from the [ oii ] @xmath28 line to the h@xmath29 line at a redshift of about 0.5 , and moderately high spectral resolution . after reducing the spectra using the standard deimos pipeline developed by the deep2 team ,",

    "since it is impractical to cover the entire sample of galaxies spectroscopically from the cluster core to the outskirt , we had to select targets in a way that increases the efficiency of cluster member detections while minimizing any potential bias . since , at the time this project started , we did not have imaging data in a sufficient number of bandpasses to determine credible photometric redshifts , the target list for our spectroscopic observations is selected using the color magnitude diagram for the v and r@xmath23 filters ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) , making use of the cluster red sequence . to maximize completeness , we limit our survey to relatively bright objects ( @xmath39 , which is , equivalently , m@xmath40m@xmath25 + 2 at z=@xmath41 ) while adopting a generous color cut toward the blue end of the distribution .",

    "if we assume that the probability derived from the observed sample is representative , and that the gaussian fit can be extrapolated to yet bluer colors , we would expect our survey to be incomplete at the @xmath42 level .",
    "we note , however , that this incompleteness is severely color - dependent which , as we will show in  5.2 , could potentially cause the fraction of emission - line galaxies , but not the fraction of e+a galaxies , to be significantly underestimated .",
    "we define the completeness of our spectroscopic survey as the ratio of the number of sources observed to the number of sources in the photometric catalogue ( within the color band marked in fig .  [ cmd ] ) , including spectra from which we failed to measure a redshift .",
    "in addition we define the efficiency of our survey as the ratio of the number of high - quality spectra , from which both the redshift and the equivalent width of spectral features can be measured accurately ( again within the color limits marked in fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) .",
    "the completeness and efficiency as a function of galaxy magnitude are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ completeness ] . inside the entire study region ,",
    "the completeness is roughly constant at about @xmath43 at r@xmath44 , with the curve only dropping within the very last bin before the magnitude limit at r@xmath45 .",
    "also shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ completeness ] is the completeness within a radius of 2 mpc from the center of the cluster : again the completeness is roughly independent of magnitude ( except for the final bin before our global magnitude limit ) but now at a much higher level near unity .",
    "although the difference between these two curves shows that the completeness of our survey is not spatially uniform , the relative spatial distribution of galaxies of different types should be unaffected .",
    "the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ completeness ] shows the efficiency in determining the galaxy redshift and the efficiency for spectroscopic classification .",
    "the former is almost perfect over the full magnitude range .",
    "the criteria used to classify galaxies according to spectral type ( defined in the following two sections ) are much stricter ; still , the efficiency for spectroscopic classification remains better than @xmath46 at all magnitudes , reflecting the good signal - to - noise ratio of most of our spectra .",
    "only a handful of spectra feature very low signal - to - noise ratios which are caused either by poor slit positioning or by erroneously high magnitudes reported by sextractor . if the redshift can be measured but no spectral type can be determined , the reasons are usually that the key spectral features fall onto the chip gap or coincide with telluric lines .      in order to allow a comparison of our results with those from previous spectroscopic studies of cluster galaxies we follow the approach of @xcite to measure equivalent widths ( ew ) , i.e.  the inverse - variance weighted integration of the flux over a spectral line , using integration windows as defined in @xcite .",
    "ew of three spectral features are measured this way : [ oii ] @xmath28 , h@xmath9 , and h@xmath37 . for those galaxies with strong emission features but weak or non - detectable continuum , a lower limit to the ew is calculated based on the variance of the spectrum near the spectral feature in question .",
    "an exception is the case of the h@xmath29 emission line for which the ew could be underestimated if absorption is present too .",
    "we account for this potential bias by subtracting the ew of the h@xmath29 absorption as provided by stellar population models @xcite fitted to the data from 4060  to 5360  ( rest frame ) using the template - fitting code _",
    "ppxf _ @xcite .",
    "we adopt the convention that negative ( positive ) ew values indicate emission ( absorption ) .",
    "hereafter , we will use the convention that @xmath47 $ ] refers to the ew of [ oii ] in emission , whereas @xmath48 and @xmath49 refer to the ew of the respective lines in absorption .",
    "since we have fitted the emission and absorption components of h@xmath29 separately , the ew of h@xmath29 in absorption and emission will be specified as @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we classify cluster galaxies as emission - line galaxies , absorption - line galaxies , and e+a galaxies , following the spirit of the classification used by @xcite with a few modifications .",
    "the classification scheme of @xcite only requires the relatively blue features [ oii ] , h@xmath9 , and h@xmath37 , which is convenient for spectroscopic surveys of clusters out to redshift @xmath52 for which redder spectral lines are observationally inaccessible in the optical passband .",
    "[ oii ] emission is an indicator of current activity ( be it star formation or the presence of an active nucleus ) , whereas the two balmer line features and h@xmath37 , without any attempts at quantifying , or accounting for , emission components in these lines . ]",
    "are indicators of star formation within the last few hundred million years .",
    "the balmer emission lines , however , are more robust diagnostics of star - formation activity ( e.g. @xcite ) than [ oii ] .",
    "since the latter is easily underestimated because of extinction , the absence of [ oii ] emission does not necessarily preclude the presence of star formation or other galaxy activity .",
    "although h@xmath53 is not accessible to optical surveys for galaxies at @xmath27 , the h@xmath29 line of most of the galaxies in our target cluster falls within the observable spectral range ( although it comes dangerously close to the broad atmospheric h@xmath54o absorption band at 7600 ) .",
    "we therefore use both @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath51 to define emission - line galaxies , the specific criteria being : @xmath47 < -5 $ ]   ( the same cutoff as @xcite ) or @xmath55 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath47 > -5 $ ]   and @xmath56  will be classified as absorption - line galaxies if @xmath57  ( the latter criterion being identical to the one used by @xcite ) .    as for e+a galaxies ,",
    "we deviate yet further from @xcite who simply define e+a galaxies to be all galaxies that are neither emission- or absorption - line galaxies .",
    "the definition adopted for this work is more conservative in that we require an e+a galaxy to have _ no _ detectable @xmath47 $ ] or @xmath58 and @xmath596   ( as compared to the cutoff value of 4  of @xcite ) .",
    "this definition leaves a small fraction of our galaxy sample unclassified , in recognition of the aforementioned gray areas between e+a galaxies and both emission- and absorption - line galaxies .",
    "the motivation for our choice of more stringent criteria is twofold .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , local samples of e+a galaxies compiled without information about h@xmath53 may suffer from as much as @xmath60 contamination by h@xmath53 emission - line galaxies .",
    "@xcite , however , found that a linear combination of the strengths of three balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath29 , h@xmath9 , and h@xmath37 ) can be efficiently used to identify this contaminating population .",
    "following @xcite we thus calculate the average of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for all galaxies in our sample that meet the more generous definition of e+a galaxies of @xcite , and for which the h@xmath29 line is observable .",
    "we find that only @xmath61 of them meet the criterion that @xmath62  @xcite , implying that more than half of the population thus selected may in fact feature h@xmath53 in emission . if , however , we raise the threshold value for @xmath63 from 4 to 6 , then @xmath64 of the galaxies thus selected , and for which the h@xmath29 line is available , fulfill the criteria of @xcite .",
    "the second motivation for our more stringent definition of e+a galaxies is that the detection of [ oii ] in a galaxy is not an unambiguous sign of star formation but could also be indicative of non - stellar radiation .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that a large fraction of post - starburst galaxies may be misidentified as undergoing current star formation , although the [ oii ] emission actually originates from agn .",
    "since our project has currently no means of efficiently distinguishing between star - bursting galaxies and post - starburst galaxies containing agn , and since the compilation of a statistically complete sample of post - starburst galaxies is not the main goal of this work , we exclude from our e+a sample all galaxies featuring _ any _ [ oii ] emission , in order to keep the resulting sample as clean as possible and avoid complications caused by the presence of agn for the interpretation of the mechanisms responsible for the termination of star formation activity .",
    "although the sample of e+a galaxies selected by our more conservative criteria thus misses a possibly sizeable and interesting fraction of the entire post - starburst population as suggested in @xcite , it is better suited to study the interactions between galaxies and the intra - cluster medium , and it is also less contaminated by weakly star - forming galaxies .    following @xcite , we can classify the emission - line galaxies further into e(a ) , e(b ) , and e(c ) sub - types based on the strength of the @xmath48 absorption and @xmath47 $ ] emission lines .",
    "both of these features are indicative of starbursts within a few million years to one billion years before the time of observation .",
    "specifically , e(a ) galaxies are defined as systems with @xmath65  and @xmath66@xmath67<-5$] , whereas e(b ) galaxies feature @xmath47<-40$] , regardless of @xmath48 ; the spectral evidence of young and massive stars in either of these subtypes suggests recent starbursts .",
    "all other emission - line galaxies , i.e.  systems lacking signs of explosive star formation in the recent past are classified as e(c ) . the difference between e(b ) , e(a ) , and e+a galaxies is thus the decreasing strength of the [ oii ] emission line .",
    "the absence of [ oii ] in e+a galaxies suggests that the star formation activity is halted , whereas , at the opposite extreme , strong [ oii ] emission makes the e(b ) sub - type promising candidates of starburst galaxies .",
    "the , in terms of [ oii ] strength , intermediate e(a ) galaxies , on the other hand , are not easily placed in this sequence since , as mentioned before , the strength of [ oii ] emission is highly sensitive to dust extinction .",
    "@xcite , for instance , find about half of a sample of very luminous infrared galaxies [ log(l@xmath68/l@xmath69)@xmath7011.5 ] to exhibit e(a ) spectra .",
    "the distinction between these three populations is thus ambiguous ; some of the e+a galaxies may actually be e(a ) galaxies whose [ oii ] emission is completely extinguished by dust .",
    "conversely , some of the e(a ) galaxies could in fact be post - starburst galaxies with some residual star formation . in spite of these ambiguities , we emphasize that e(a ) and e+a galaxies are in general distinct populations , which is  as we shall demonstrate  reflected in their different distribution within the cluster environment .",
    "the relevance of e(a ) and e(b ) galaxies in the context of this study is the potential for both galaxy types to trace the e+a progenitor population .    for clarity ,",

    "we conclude that , at least for the system under investigation here , the physical mechanism responsible for the termination of star formation in this galaxy type must be a different one .",
    "the arguably most interesting result of our spectral analysis of the galaxy population of the cluster / filament system macsj0717.5 + 3745 is the spatial distribution of e+a galaxies , which may provide important clues about the physical mechanism triggering the e+a transition phase between actively star forming and passively evolving galaxies .",
    "three aspects need to be considered in this context : what is the origin of the galaxies that evolve into e+a galaxies , what are the mechanisms that trigger the starburst , and what are the mechanism(s ) responsible for terminating it ?      a first clue about the origin of the e+a galaxies in macsj0717.5 + 3745 can be obtained from their spatial distribution .",
    "if the galaxies that develop the e+a spectral characteristics originated from the large - scale filament or the galaxy groups embedded therein , one would expect e+a galaxies to be found preferentially near the filament - cluster interface . according to fig .",
    "[ galxdistr ] this is not the case .",
    "although the spatial distribution of e+a galaxies exhibits a slight elongation in the direction of the ( projected ) direction of infall along the filament , their location with respect to the cluster core is consistent with a roughly spherical distribution which , in turn , suggests an isotropic distribution of the progenitor population",

    "galaxies currently undergoing strong star formation i.e. , the e(a ) and e(b ) subtypes of emission - line galaxies , are thus natural candidates for the role of progenitors of e+a galaxies , and should , to some extent , trace the spatial distribution of the progenitor population . examining , again , fig .",

    "the characteristic density of this typical e(a)/e(b ) environment is higher than that of the infall region but lower than the one found in galaxy groups  as a result , these potential e+a progenitors are missing from the denser regions of our study area as well as from the field .    results from our complete survey of the galaxy population of the most distant macs clusters should allow us to address these issues with a much larger degree of certainty .",

    "by contrast , the time @xcite needed for a galaxy to fall from the virial radius , where star formation would be triggered , to the ram - pressure stripping radius , where the star formation would be terminated again essentially instantaneously , and then on to the cluster core ( @xmath78 1gyr ) is well matched to the lifetime of the e+a phase ( @xmath78 1gyr ) .",
    "we note though that galaxy mergers are not ruled out in terms of effective time scale ( a few hundreds million years ) as a mechanism for the creation of e+a galaxies in general . in the field mergers appear indeed to be the dominant mechanism @xcite . this dichotomy between the origin of e+a galaxies in low- and high - density environments",

    "in addition , the fact that the e+a galaxies in ms0451.60305 avoid the dense cluster core lends support to the hypothesis ( see  5.5 ) that the true three - dimensional spatial distribution of this type of galaxies resembles a shell inside the ram - pressure stripping radius .",
    "no e+a galaxy at all is found in cl0024 + 16 .",
    "however , as reflected in its much smaller ram - pressure stripping radius , this cluster is much less massive than either of ms0451.60305 and macsj0717.5 + 3745 .",
    "in fact , the density of this cluster s core region is still likely to be overestimated because of the unusual geometric and dynamical properties of cl0024 + 16 , which is known to be a high - velocity merger along our line of sight @xcite .",

    "[ xrayim ] shows the complex x - ray morphology of the cluster core ) , this hypothesis would make the absence of e+a galaxies in cl0024 + 16 even harder to explain .",
    "macsj0717.5 + 3745 is a very x - ray luminous cluster at @xmath8 which shows complex sub - cluster and filamentary structure in both x - ray surface brightness and galaxy density . along the filament",
    ", we detect a significant offset in the average redshift of galaxies , corresponding to @xmath170 km  s@xmath36 in velocity , as well as a decrease in velocity dispersion from the core of the primary cluster to the end of filament .",
    "these variations are likely a combination of spatial ( hubble flow ) and kinematic effects ( peculiar velocities ) in this highly disturbed , merging system ; a detailed analysis and discussion of the three - dimensional geometry and dynamics of macsj0717.5 + 3745 will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    using the spectroscopic data obtained by us , primarily with the deimos spectrograph on the keck - ii telescope , we perform an extensive analysis of the spatial distribution of galaxies of different spectroscopic types , from the cluster core to the cluster outskirts and the connected linear filament . the spectroscopic sample is selected using blue and red color cuts defined relative to the empirical cluster red sequence in the v and r@xmath87 bands . the final spectroscopic catalog is more than @xmath43 complete at r@xmath171 .",
    "the applied blue color cut causes the number of emission - line galaxies in this structure , in particular the starburst galaxies , to be underestimated  our analysis of the spatial distribution of the cluster members of various spectroscopic types should , however , not be affected .",
    "we classify cluster members into emission - line , absorption - line , and e+a galaxies using the strength of the [ oii ] and h@xmath29 emission lines , as well as the absorption features h@xmath9 and h@xmath37 .",
    "the emission - line galaxies are further categorized into the subtypes e(a ) , e(b ) , and e(c ) , depending on the strengths of the [ oii ] emission- and h@xmath9 absorption - line features .",
    "we emphasize that in order to eliminate contamination from absorption- or emission - line galaxies , we adopt a very strict criterion for our definition of e+a galaxies , namely @xmath172 , and also require the absence of [ oii ] and h@xmath29 emission .",
    "the location of these e+a galaxies in color - magnitude and color - color diagrams confirms that they represent the transition phase between emission - line galaxies , in particular the e(a ) and e(b ) sub - types , and absorption - line galaxies .",
    "the main result of this study is that e+a galaxies are found to reside almost exclusively within the ram - pressure radius of the cluster . since e+a galaxies",
    "are not observed in significant numbers in other regions of this system where the local galaxy density is similarly high , and since the relatively high galaxy velocities near the ram - pressure radius are unfavourable for galaxy mergers , we conclude that galaxy - gas interactions , rather than galaxy mergers , are likely the dominant mechanism for the evolution of the e+a galaxies , at least in clusters at intermediate redshift .",
    "our interpretation that the star formation in these galaxies is terminated because the gas reservoir is being stripped away by the intra - cluster medium as galaxies fall into the cluster core is consistent with the results obtained for other two clusters , ms0451.60305 and cl0024 + 16 .",
    "e+a galaxies are only found within the ram - pressure radius of ms0451.60305 , and no e+a galaxies at all are found in cl0024 + 16 , a low - mass system featuring a very small ram - pressure stripping radius .",
    "the large number of e+a galaxies around the core of macsj0717.7 + 3745 , compared to the similarly x - ray luminous cluster ms0451.60305 , can be naturally explained by the significant merger activity in the latter system , an effect that is consistent with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "although the spatial distribution of e+a galaxies in macsj0717.7 + 3745 shows clear evidence of environmental effects on galaxy evolution in clusters , many issues still need further investigation .",
    "specifically , we need to better understand the role of cluster mergers , and what exactly triggers starbursts as galaxies are falling into the cluster",
    ". both of these questions can be addressed by extending this work to the full sample of the 12 most distant macs clusters , thereby covering systems of very different dynamical states and a wide range of large - scale environments . for macsj0717.7",
    "+ 3745 , accurate star - formation rates measured from infrared data obtained with spitzer will help greatly in this regard .",
    "in addition we aim to use galaxy morphologies and deep x - ray observations to study in detail the gas - galaxy interactions which we suspect to be responsible for the termination of star formation activity and thus the creation of e+a galaxies in clusters .",
