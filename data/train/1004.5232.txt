    "a key strategic objective of the _ fermi _ mission is a survey of the sky at gamma - ray energies , making use of the large area and field of view of the lat instrument @xcite .",
    "the telescope allows the detection of sources with an angular resolution of about 0.6 degrees ( 68% at 1 gev ) and a point source location accuracy ( psla ) varying from around 1 to 6 arcminutess , depending on the detection significance . in the first _ fermi _ catalogue ( @xcite ) , comprising data from the initial 11 months of the science phase of the mission , there are 1451 objects listed , of which 821 have been associated with known sources at other wavelengths .",
    "these identified sources comprise both extragalactic and galactic objects with the former including blazars ( flat spectrum radio qsos ( fsrq ) or bl lacs ) , a few radio galaxies and 4 normal galaxies , while the latter is made up of pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae , supernova remnants , globular clusters and a few binaries .",
    "some peculiar objects are also found but their associations are less secure .",
    "no plausible counterparts have been found for the remaining 630 objects and therefore these can not yet be associated with any known class of gamma - ray emitting objects .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat agn catalogue ( @xcite , hereafter a1 ) lowers the confidence limit to 50% for high latitude ( @xmath1 ) sources and thereby provides possible counterparts for another 26 of these sources , and for 104 more there are potential associations ( affiliations ) but with unquantified confidence .",
    "searching for counterparts of these new high energy sources is a primary objective of the survey work but it is made very difficult by the large , with respect to other wavelengths , _ fermi _ error boxes .",
    "this uncertainty in their locations means that a positional correlation with a known object is usually not enough to identify a _",
    "fermi _ source and instead , a multiwavelength approach , using x - ray , optical and radio data of likely counterparts must be used in order to understand their nature and to evaluate the likelihood of their association with the _ fermi _ detections .",
    "searches for x - ray counterparts are particularly useful in finding a positionally - correlated , highly - unusual object with the special parameters that might be expected to produce gamma rays .",
    "x - ray surveys are well suited for this type of search because they offer 3 great advantages : a ) they allow a full coverage of the _ fermi _ error box , b ) they provide arcsecond location accuracy and c ) they give information in an energy band quite close to that in which _ fermi _ operates",
    ". cross correlation analysis using x - ray catalogues can therefore be a useful tool with which to restrict the positional uncertainty of the objects detected by _",
    "fermi _ and",
    "so to facilitate the identification process .",
    "herein , we report on the strong level of positional correlation between the unassociated _ fermi _ sources and the _ rosat _ all sky survey bright source catalogue leading to evidence for the association of a number of gev sources with a soft x - ray counterpart , better positions for all correlated objects and hence the possibility of optical follow - up work .",
    "we find that most of these associations are with bl lac or bl lac candidates .",
    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey was performed in the period july 1990 to february 1991 with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the position sensitive proportional counter @xcite .",
    "the survey mapped 145,060 sources in the soft x - ray band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) from which the bright source catalogue ( rassbsc-1.4.2rxs ) , containing 18806 rass sources having a pspc count rate larger than 0.05 cts / s and at least 15 source counts , was extracted @xcite .",
    "many of these sources have been identified with objects expected to emit even at high energies , i.e in the _ fermi_/lat regime .    to perform the correlation , instead of using the entire first year _ fermi _ catalogue , we chose to use only those 630 which were listed as unassociated in order to keep the possibility of chance positional coincidences to a minimum .",
    "we used the standard statistical technique which has been employed very succesfully to help identify sources found in the various _",
    "integral_/ibis surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this consists of simply calculating the number of _ fermi _ sources for which at least one _ rosat _ counterpart was within a specified distance , out to a distance where all _ fermi _ sources had at least one _ rosat _ counterpart . to have a control group we create a list of fake anti-_fermi_ sources . for every object in the _ fermi _ list",
    "we make a corresponding source in the fake list with coordinates mirrored in galactic longitude and latitude ( this mirroring was chosen due to the strong galactic component evident in the lat distribution ) , and the same correlation algorithm was then applied betweeen this list and the _ rosat _ catalogue .",
    "figure 1a shows the results of this process .",
    "the lower solid curve is the anti - source correlation , while the dashed line is that expected from chance correlations given the number of _ fermi _ objects and the number of _ rosat _ sources .",
    "it is clear that , in this case , the number of correlations can be completely explained by chance .",
    "the upper solid curve , however , shows the number of associations for the _ fermi _ unidentified sources , and demonstrates that a strong correlation exists .",
    "figure 1b shows the difference in the number of associations between the true and false data sets .",
    "the point at which the curve flattens off gives the total number of associations present in the data set , which is around 60 . in this analysis",
    "we have not used the positional errors of either catalogue , but the shape of the curve should be compatible with the psla of _ fermi _ as the uncertainy in the _ rosat _ position is negligible in comparison . by fitting a series of inverse gaussians to the data we find the curve to be consistent with a combination of location errors varying between around 1 and 4 arcminutes ( dashed line in figure 1b ) , consistent with the range in errors quoted for the _ fermi _ sources .    clearly ,",
    "even though there are around 60 true associations in the dataset , we can not search for counterparts for them all as we do not know exactly which sources are correctly identified as being correlated . at around 500 arcseconds ,",
    "all we know is that around 60 of the 77 correlations found will be correct .",
    "for this reason we limit the correlation distance to 160 arcseconds , where less than two false associations are expected , from a total of 30 sources with possible rassbsc counterparts . in order to provide a rough estimate of the probability of association we note that the number of false sources is expected to be 1@xmath21 .",
    "this indicates that , given no other information , the likelihood of any one source being associated correctly is around 74% . if we can assume that the extra information on x - ray source type allows us to assert that we know the identity of one chance alignment ( 1fgl j0841.4 - 3558 , see below ) then this probability will rise to over 90% for any individual source in the list",
    "for the 30 _ fermi _ sources which have a possible counterpart within 160 arcseconds , table 1 reports the _ fermi _ name , _ rosat _ coordinates , both instruments error box radius as well as the distance of the _ rosat _ position from that of the _ fermi_/lat location .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "uncertainty provides a smaller error box than _ fermi _ by about an order of magnitude , and so allows an easier search for counterparts ; furthermore in many cases xmmslew @xcite , xmm serendipitous @xcite and / or__swift__/xrt measurements provide an even smaller error box and therefore an unambigous source identification . in the following we discuss each individual _",
    "rosat _ source in detail trying to provide when possible an indication of its nature and class ( see last two columns in table 1 ) .",
    "in particular , we use x - ray and radio data from the literature and/or archives to assess the object type and hence its association with the _ fermi _ detection .",
    "historically agn were discovered by radio observations .",
    "radio emission is often a way to recognize active galaxies , except at lower luminosities where star - formation in galaxies can also stimulate radio production .",
    "therefore , for bright objects , mere detection in radio provides support for the presence of an active galaxy , although contamination from galactic sources may come from snr , pulsars and microquasars . in some cases ,",
    "the radio spectrum , morphology and loudness can help in discriminating between the above possibilities since a compact source with a flat spectrum which is radio loud is often indicative of a blazar type agn , i.e. those strongly correlated with emission in the gev domain .",
    "so , while mere radio detection does not imply identification with an agn , the combination of x ( and even more gamma - ray ) emission plus association with a loud , compact and flat spectrum radio source provides strong support ( augmented if it is located away from the galactic plane ) for the extragalactic nature of an unclassified object and further suggests a blazar classification .    for this study",
    ", we inspect radio images taken from the nvss ( nrao vla sky survey , @xcite ) and the sumss surveys ( sydney university molonglo sky survey , @xcite ) .",
    "all sources which have a radio flux listed in table 1 , have a compact radio structure except for the case of the supernova remnant g043.3 - 00.2 .",
    "a flat radio spectrum is often indicative of a blazar type object : indeed in a1 the overall distribution is consistent with a flat spectral index ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "no difference is found between fsrqs and bl lacs .",
    "information on the radio spectrum of our sources ( see table 2 ) , can be obtained from specfind @xcite which is a tool used to cross - identify radio sources in various catalogues on the basis of self - consistent spectral index as well as position .",
    "this allows the combination of data at different frequencies and the estimation of the source radio spectrum as @xmath4 where @xmath5 in expressed in jy and @xmath6 in mhz .",
    "flat spectrum sources are those with a@xmath7 0.5 only four ( 1fgl j0137.8 + 5814 , 1fgl j2056.7 + 4938 , 1fgl j2329.2 + 3755 and 1fgl j1926.8 + 6153 ) of the 30 _ rosat _ sources had information about the spectral slope in the specfind database and all were found to have a flat radio spectrum .",
    "indication of a flat spectrum in other sources can be found in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or from archival radio data ( taken from heasarc and/or ned ) ; when available a radio loudness indication is also reported in the discussion of each individual source .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "flux , calculated in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , has also been estimated and listed in table 2 .    as a final point , we note that 14 objects listed in the tables appear in a1 and all are listed as affiliations .",
    "these are agn or agn candidates found inside the 95@xmath8 _ fermi _ error ellipse that show hint of blazar characteristics such as a radio and x - ray emission plus indication in the literature of variability polarization etc . for 9 of these objects a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) class",

    "1fgl j0841.4 - 3558*. the _ rosat _ source is probably the x - ray counterpart of the star hip 42640 ( simbad name ) of spectral type f2v , unlikely to be a gamma - ray emitter in the _ fermi _ catalogue .",
    "this could well be a chance positional alignment , one of which is expected given the number of objects in the sample analysed in this work .    *",
    "1fgl j1910.9 + 0906*. this _ rosat _ source is most likely associated to the supernova remnant g043.3 - 00.2 ( also known as was49b ) the x - ray source is slightly extended and encompasses almost the entire extension of the remnant .",
    "supernovae are also found to be associated in some numbers with gev emission @xcite although it is not clear at the moment how many snr not hosting a pulsar are _ fermi _ emitters .    *",

    "the source has been associated to the uv excess source 2mass j00544675 - 2455291 , which displays a continuous spectrum with no lines . in simbad",
    "it is catalogued as a white dwarf , but the radio emission and the high latitude location suggests that it could also be an extragalactic object .",
    "indeed , the source is present in the _ fermi _ agn catalogue as an affiliated object having no optical class but a hsp sed .",
    "this source also appears in the recent catalogue of _ fermi _ detections above 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the above information suggests that it might be another bl lac .    *",
    "1fgl j1933.3 + 0723*. this source , located close to the galactic plane , has a radio detection at 6 and 20 cm with a flux of 94 and 104 mjy @xcite , which implies a flat spectrum source .",
    "no other information is available , but the radio properties and the x - ray emission could be taken as evidence that it is another case of an agn behind our galaxy .    * 1fgl j1553.5 - 3116*. this _ rosat _ object has a detection in both the nvss and in the sumss with a 20 and 36 cm flux of 156 and 139 mjy which indicates a flat radio spectrum .",
    "the high latitude location as well as the x - ray and radio emission clearly indicate that this is an agn .",
    "indeed the source , listed among the _ fermi _ agn affiliations is optically classified as a bl lac and further characterized as a hsp object .    * 1fgl j1841.9 + 3220*. in this case the _ rosat _ source is also detected by xrt on__swift _ _ , which allows the location uncertainty to be restricted and the x - ray spectral characteristics to be studied .",
    "the smaller xrt error box allows an identification with the radio source rgb j1841 + 323 .",
    "the xrt spectrum has a good fit with an absorbed power law having @xmath22 in the range 2.1 - 2.5 and a galactic column density of 8.4@xmath1710@xmath21 @xmath14 ; the 0.2 - 12 kev flux is in the range 1.6 - 1.9@xmath1710@xmath18 erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 .",
    "the available 6 and 20 cm fluxes of 14 and 20 mjy @xcite suggests that the radio spectrum might be flat ; rgb j1841 + 323 has also been reported as a radio loud agn first by @xcite and later by @xcite .",
    "finally it is listed in the seoul national university bright quasar survey @xcite , which is the base for the ned classification as a qso candidate and hence a probable blazar type object .",
    "the source is listed among the _ fermi _ agn affiliations with the same association proposed here and with a hsp sed class , which indicates that it may be a bl lac rather than a flat spectrum radio quasar .    *",
    "1fgl j1419.7 + 7731*. this _ rosat _ detection is also a radio emitter with a 20 cm flux of 8 mjy .",
    "an optical observation of the source indicates that it is a weak point - like object with an extremely blue continuum @xcite ; the source is also listed in the million qso catalogue ( http://quasars.org/milliquas.htm ) .",

    "this source is also listed between the _ fermi _ agn affiliations but is wrongly identified with the galaxy apmuks(bj ) b232010.42 - 493502.4 , which is not associated to the _ rosat _ and/or xmmslew detections .",
    "the source is located at high galactic latitudes , is likely an x - ray emitter and possibly also a radio source which all together suggest an agn nature .    *",
    "1fgl j0223.0 - 1118 * here too the _ rosat _ object has an association to a xmm slew source , xmmsl1 j022314.7 - 111735 , which is identified with nvss j022314 - 111737 , a radio object not yet optically classified ; it is associated to the galaxy 6df j022314.3 - 111738 at redshift 0.042 , but the optical spectrum is of too poor quality to allow a proper classification .",
    "the xmmslew catalogue reports a 0.2 - 12 kev flux of 1.97@xmath1710@xmath18 erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 , while the nvss provides a radio detection of 14 mjy at 20 cm .",
    "the source is clearly an agn in the local universe .",
    "the first result of this work is that a number of likely x - ray counterparts to _ fermi _ sources have been found .",
    "statistically there should only be around one chance alignment which is probably that of 1fgl j0841.4 - 3558 given the type of the x - ray source .",
    "the majority of the associations are of extragalactic nature while only 2 or 3 cases ( a snr , a binary system and maybe a microquasar ) are galactic . of the extragalactic objects many are bl lac or bl lac candidates , i.e. objects that are expected to have gev emission .",
    "in other cases the source maybe radio loud or radio flat , characteristics that are often common to agn emitting in the _ fermi _ band ( see table 2 and the previous section ) .",
    "some information on the nature of the _ fermi _ sources can also be gained from the gev properties as reported in the _ fermi _ catalogue ; for each source of interest here table 2 provides the _ fermi _ 1 - 100 gev flux , power law photon index , curvature index and variability index.for example both curvature and variability index can be used to discriminate between source types : as shown in figure 11 of @xcite one can clearly separate the pulsar branch located at large curvature and small variability indices from the blazar branch which is found at large variability and small curvature indices .",
    "using these parameters and following the broad division adopted by abdo and co - workers , we conclude that all extragalactic objects in table 1 are compatible with being blazars ; the few exception are 1fgl j1942.7 + 1033 , 1fgl j1227.9 - 4852 and 1fgl j1910.9 + 0906 which are border line objects .",
    "the last two are indeed non blazar type objects while 1fgl j1942.7 + 1033 despite its location in the diagram is most likely a bl lac given its broad band properties ( see previous section ) .    in the following discussion",
    "we concentrate only on those objects that are likely to be extragalactic and so exclude the 3 sources which are galactic or spurios ( 1fgl j1227.9 - 4852 , 1fgl j1910.9 + 0906 and 1fgl j0841.4 - 3558 ) but leave 1fgl j2056.7 + 4938 as it could well be a blazar behind the galactic plane . to go deeper in our understanding of the nature of the _ rosat_-_fermi _ associations , we can use the gamma - ray photon index to discriminate between bl lac and fsrqs . from figure 12 in @xcite",
    ", we see the latter have a lower limit to the _ fermi _ photon index of 2 , while that for bl lac objects peak around this value with a range from about 1.2 to 2.7 . of the 27 extragalactic sources 16 have a photon index below this critical value and",
    "so must be strongly suspected to be bl lacs .",
    "furthermore there are another 7 objects which have a steeper spectrum but have already been optically classified as bl lacs therefore in total we have at least 23 objects which probably belong to this class .",
    "similarly , the intensity of the gev emission suggests a preference for bl lac objects among our sample , since the log of the _ fermi _ flux reported in table 2 is always below -8.0 .",
    "( see figure 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally if we plot the 0.1 - 2.4 x - ray flux versus the flux density at 20 cm for those objects which have both values , we find that their location in this diagram is again in the region populated by bl lac objects ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus it seems that the cross correlation using the _ rosat _ bright source catalogue tends to select associations with _ _ ferm__i sources that are bl lac type agn . to test this finding",
    "we can use the same statistical correlation method but on the sample of _ fermi _ objects that are classified in the first catalogue as blazars ( bzq and bzb ) .",
    "there are 573 such sources in the _ fermi _ list , with almost the same number of objects in each of the two clases ( 51% bl lac ) .",
    "again the correlation is strong with 181 associations within 300 arcseconds . of these objects , the overwhelming majority ( 137 )",
    "are with those already identified as bl lac sources . the selection effect towards bl lac when using the _ rosat _",
    "bright source catalogue is likely related to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these objects compared to fsrq . in the widely adopted scenario of blazars , a single population of high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet radiate from the radio / fir to the uv- soft x - ray by the synchrotron process and at higher frequencies by inverse compton scattering of soft - target photons present either in the jet ( synchrotron self - compton [ ssc ] model ) , in the surrounding material ( external compton [ ec ] model ) , or in both ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore a strong signature of the blazar nature of a source is a double peaked structure in the sed , with the synchrotron component peaking anywhere from infrared to x - rays and the inverse compton extending up to gev or even tev gamma - rays . among blazars ,",
    "bl lacertae objects are the sources with the highest variety of synchrotron peak frequencies , ranging from the ir - optical to the uv - soft - x bands ( called low or high energy peak bl lacs , respectively , see @xcite ) . the x - ray selection discussed",
    "herein should favour objects peaking at high energies , i.e. in the x - ray band : indeed 9 objects discussed in the previous section and affiliated to the _ fermi _ agn catalogue , are also classified as high synchrotron peaked agn .",
    "given their high synchrotron peak energies , which flag the presence of high energy electrons , these extreme bl lacs are also good candidates for tev emission as the compton peak is expected in this energy range .",
    "one source in our sample , 1fgl j0648.8 + 1516 , has already been detected by veritas in the tev range while another , 1fgl 0054.9 - 2455 , has been seen above 100 gev .",
    "the interest in these extreme tev blazars is driven by the possibility of obtaining information both on the acceleration processes of charged particles in relativistic flows and on the intensity of the extragalactic background light which absorbs the flux from high energy sourxces @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , as expected , there is a strong correlation between the _ fermi _ survey source list and the _ rosat _ all sky survey bright source catalogue , finding that there should be about 60 sources common to both lists . by placing a maximum correlation distance of 160 arcseconds in order to minimise chance associations we have a sample of 30 objects in which only @xmath26 should be by chance alignment .",
    "we can use the _ rosat _ error box to help find optical counterparts for these sources , which in all cases is sufficiently small to allow the identification of one single object .",
    "most of the associations are of extragalactic nature , with only a few being galactic .",
    "we have also shown that this cross correlation analysis appears to preferentially select bl lac objects .",
    "these x - ray selected objects are often hsp bl lacs and are thereffore good candidates for tev emission .",
    "clearly only optical spectroscopy of the _ rosat _ counterparts can confirm this suggestion , but cross correlation with other catalogues may provide a different selection criterion and hence different source types .",
