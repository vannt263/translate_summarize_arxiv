    "the existence of the maximum in the function @xmath64 results an interesting physical effect of weakening the inelastic eclipsing ( screening ) at superhigh energies .",
    "the energy @xmath69 at the maximum of @xmath64 can be calculated from the equation @xmath70 , and one obtains in this way : @xmath71 @xcite .    from geometrical point of view , if we would consider the standard glauber correction as the shadowing where one two - dimensional sphere is in eclipse with the other two - dimensional sphere , then the inelastic screening and the effect of its weakening should be considered as the shadowing where a five - dimensional sphere  casts \" its shadow on a two - dimensional sphere .",
    "so , we really see here the true play of the spheres .",
    "it is very important that formula ( [ 46 ] ) contains only experimentally measured quantities .",
