    "cellular automata are useful in a variety of problems related to statistical mechanics , traffic flow , and so on .",
    "the simplest sort of cellular automaton is the _ elementary cellular automaton _ which is one - dimensional with two states .",
    "these have interesting behaviour such as chaos and turing - completeness , and are described extensively in wolfram s pioneering paper @xcite as well as later works @xcite .",
    "the biham  middleton  levine ( bml ) traffic model was first proposed in 1992 to study traffic flow @xcite , as a 2d analog of the elementary rule 184 .",
    "it consists of a rectangular lattice , with periodic boundary conditions , where each site may be empty , contain a red car , or a blue car . on each time step : all red cars synchronously attempt to move one step east if the site is empty ; then all blue cars synchronously attempt to move one step south if the site is empty . for some parameter @xmath2 $ ] , the model is initialized by assigning to each site either a red car with probability @xmath3 , or a blue car with probability @xmath3 , or empty space otherwise .",
    "the model is interesting because , for small values of @xmath4 it self organizes into a free flow where cars move freely without ever stopping , whereas for large @xmath4 it converges to a global jam .",
    "it was initially believed that there is a sharp transition between these two phases , but in 2005 a stable intermediate phase was discovered for lattices of coprime dimensions @xcite , and then shown in 2008 to exist for square lattices @xcite .    the bml model s simplicity and interesting behavior has inspired research that tweak every aspect of the model @xcite , such as dimensionality @xcite , lattice geometry @xcite , boundary conditions @xcite , the update rule @xcite , initialization @xcite , and so on .",
    "many other cellular automaton models were proposed for modelling traffic @xcite .",
    "although the bml traffic model was described as an `` analog '' of rule 184 , no attempt was made to formulate a rigorous description of the analogy , or a general method of finding such analogs of other elementary rules @xcite .",
    "we show that other elementary cellular automata can be generalized into two or more dimensions with arbitrarily many states , by sequentially applying the same rule in each dimension .",
    "historically , work on two - dimensional cellular automata have mostly focused on the von neumann or moore neighborhood , resulting in a large neighborhood . by applying the same rule in each dimension sequentially",
    ", we only have a neighborhood of size 3 regardless of dimensionality . in this paper",
    ", we describe an extension of wolfram s naming scheme for elementary cellular automata to higher dimensions and states ; then we describe a new discovery in the bml traffic model ; finally we describe and analyze a variety of different cellular automata with interesting behaviors and resembling various physical systems .",
    "in elementary cellular automata , which have one dimension and two states , the update rule is represented as a single lookup table , which stores the state of the next cell as a function of itself and its two neighbors .",
    "the contents of the lookup table , when interpreted as a binary integer , is called the wolfram code @xcite .",
    "for example , rule 184 is a model of one - dimensional traffic flow where there is one type of car that attempts to move right if an empty site exists .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     put simply , if a site s neighborhood contains only cells of one colour , the site assumes that colour .",
    "otherwise , the site becomes empty .",
    "when the model is seeded with some initial distribution of red and blue cells ( same as in the bml model ) , these seeds aggressively expand to cover sites in their vicinities , and soon the lattice contains some red and blue regions separated by thin borders of empty cells .",
    "these meta - stable regions have boundaries closely approximating orthogonal polygons whose sides are approximately @xmath5 to the horizontal .",
    "a side of such a polygon can move in the direction of its normal with speed inversely proportional to its length . as shorter sides move rapidly and join with parallel sides to be longer and stabler , the complexity of each of these regions",
    "is reduced over time and the model appears to be annealing ( figure [ annealfig ] ) .",
    "the reason why the polygonal sides move with speed inversely proportional to length is because they are not in fact _ exactly _ oriented @xmath5 to the horizontal .",
    "instead , the side s slope is often off by one unit .",
    "the one `` flaw '' in the side propagates along the side back and forth , at a constant speed ; at the end of each orbit of the flaw , the side effectively moves one unit . since the period of the flaw s orbit is proportional to the length of the side , the side advances at a speed inversely proportional to the length .",
    "ultimately , the model converges to either red or blue , or some simple intermediate phase ( e.g. half red , half blue and separated by parallel boundaries ) , independent of @xmath4 .",
    "there does not appear to be any surprising phase change behavior for this model .",
    "grid , initialized in the same way as the bml traffic model , with @xmath6 . shown here from left to right is the same realization after timesteps @xmath7 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   grid , initialized in the same way as the bml traffic model , with @xmath6 .",
    "shown here from left to right is the same realization after timesteps @xmath7 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   grid , initialized in the same way as the bml traffic model , with @xmath6 . shown here from left to right",
    "is the same realization after timesteps @xmath7 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   grid , initialized in the same way as the bml traffic model , with @xmath6 . shown here from left to right is the same realization after timesteps @xmath7 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   grid , initialized in the same way as the bml traffic model , with @xmath6 . shown here from left to right is the same realization after timesteps @xmath7 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]",
    "in the previous section , somewhat nontrivial behavior along boundaries separating different phases was briefly discussed .",
    "more complex boundaries can form between more complex phases .    for some rulestrings ,",
    "when the state is initialized in the same way as the bml traffic model , the cellular automaton rapidly partitions itself into two or more different phases separated by a membrane - like frontier . like biological membranes ,",
    "this can move in time , allow particles to cross it , merge with other membranes , and so on .",
    "a consequence is that the membranes are often transient or meta - stable .",
    "depending on the initial choice of @xmath4 , the model may ultimately converge to one of the different phases .",
    "one such model is rule 152690720768 , shown in figure [ 152690720768 ] .",
    "this model was found by random rulestring generation and then visual inspection .",
    "its microscopic behavior is too complex to be studied in detail here , so instead we perform experiments to determine its sensitivity to @xmath4 .",
    "the model appears to have a sharp transition around @xmath8 , above which the blue phase dominates and below which the white phase dominates ( figure [ membraneplot ] ) .",
    "intriguingly , there are red cells sparsely interspersed throughout both phases .     lattice with @xmath9.,height=113 ]     iterations , on a @xmath10 lattice .",
    "the transition appears to occur at around @xmath8.,width=302 ]     lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]    lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ] +    lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]    lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]",
    "study of cellular automata such as the bml traffic model is severely restricted by available computing power . for a moderately sized @xmath11 lattice ,",
    "each time step requires on the order of @xmath12 site updates .",
    "supposing the model takes up to @xmath13 time steps to converge , this already takes several minutes on a typical cpu assuming a typical @xmath14 updates per second .",
    "past studies have used purpose - built hardware such mit s cam8 architecture @xcite , for which development has unfortunately stopped in 2001 due to a disk crash caused by `` mindless jerks '' @xcite .",
    "even then , it took a whole month for the simulations to run .",
    "later researchers have implemented the bml traffic model on a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) @xcite , which is suitable for the task due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of the model .",
    "our implementation also uses the gpu to process several rows of the lattice in parallel . like @xcite ,",
    "our implementation uses the cuda technology ; the graphics card used in our experiments is a single nvidia geforce gtx 970 , which has 1664 cuda cores @xcite .    as a minor note , in the implementation",
    "it is important to use a good random number generator for large simulations .",
    "many common programming languages have a built - in pseudorandom number generator that has a period of @xmath15 , far too small for generating @xmath16 simulations of size more than @xmath12 each .",
    "our implementation uses the mersenne twister with a period of @xmath17 .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a family of cellular automata operating on a neighborhood of size 3 for arbitrary @xmath0 dimensions and @xmath1 states , which operates by sequentially applying the same update rule in each dimension .",
    "this family includes the widely - studied bml traffic model , for which we present new results regarding the mobility of intermediate states .",
    "furthermore , we have briefly discussed the properties of some other cellular automata within this family , and their possible application to various problems including percolation and annealing .",
    "the advantages of using a cellular automaton for such problems include the simplicity of the model and ease of implementation .",
    "future work includes a more thorough exploration of such models ( figure [ interesting ] ) , as well as models with different numbers of dimensions and states . in particular , although this paper talks about the @xmath18 case , the simpler case of @xmath19 is yet to be explored .",
    "for this , there are only 256 rules , the same number as elementary cellular automata . for implementation , a possible idea for future",
    "optimization is the gigantic lookup table optimization @xcite , which groups adjacent sites into a block that is updated all at once .",
    "our implementation is available open source at ` https://bitbucket.org/dllu/bml-cuda/ ` .",
    "an interactive visualization for alternative rules is available at ` http://www.dllu.net/bml/ ` .",
