    "the mean specific angular momentum at this radius is given by @xmath228 .",

    "@xmath231 for a halo with a given @xmath232 this integral can be calculated numerically to give the distribution @xmath230 .",
    "we instead follow an alternative monte - carlo type approach due to its easier implementation . for a given halo once the model parameters @xmath171 and @xmath63 are known we calculate the specific angular momentum of each of the particles from equation @xmath233 where @xmath177 is drawn from a gaussian distribution of dispersion @xmath63 . in",
    "we have plotted the angular momentum distributions obtained by the above procedure along with the amds obtained from simulations .",

    "the various amds that have been analyzed in the previous sections can be well described by an analytical function that depends on just one parameter .",

    "the simple case of an exponential disk rotating in an isothermal halo ( @xmath251 ) with flat rotation curve can be calculated analytically and it gives a profile with a value of @xmath252 . to investigate the amds of disk galaxies in more detail and to find out the range of values of @xmath8 that they satisfy we create a model in which an exponential disk of mass fraction @xmath253 and scale length @xmath254 is embedded in an nfw dm halo of virial radius @xmath255 and concentration parameter @xmath188 , similar to analysis by @xcite .",
    "the disk mass fraction is defined as @xmath256 . for calculating the rotation curve",
    "we take into account the adiabatic contraction of the halo and also the flattened geometry of the disk .",

    "they do not show the characteristic dip at low @xmath5 as shown by models and also the tail has an abrupt truncation whereas the models show a smooth extended distribution .",

    "@xmath8 is a strong function of concentration parameter @xmath188 but only weakly related to @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath253 ( keeping other parameters fixed ) . for lower values of @xmath253",

    "@xmath8 increases from @xmath259 for @xmath260 to @xmath261 for @xmath262 ( with @xmath263 and @xmath264 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath265 as the typical range of values expected for real galaxies .",
    "in this section we first describe two different methods to measure the amds in halos followed by analysis of amds obtained by each of these methods .",
    "as described earlier the velocities given by simulations are of two types .",
    "the velocity of an sph particle ( gas ) refers to the streaming velocity @xmath266 while the velocity of a dm particle samples the actual microscopic velocity @xmath267 , where @xmath268 is the random motion .",
    "one method to measure the angular momentum distribution is to take the angular momentum of each particle and plot its distribution ( * particle method * ) .",
    "this inevitably gives a negative tail resulting in a significant fraction of matter with negative am .",
    "for gas we find it to be between @xmath269 to @xmath270 with a mean of about @xmath271 while for dm it is between @xmath272 to @xmath270 with a mean of @xmath273 .",
    "this not only makes the interpretation of amd obtained by the particle method difficult but also the comparison between the amds of gas and dm . to make both the components come to the same footing we can either * broaden * the velocities of gas particles or * smooth * the velocities of both gas and dm particles over a fixed number of neighbors",
    "however , even smoothening the velocities over 1000 neighbors is not enough to suppress the negative angular momentum tail .",
    "b2001 obtain the amd by dividing the halo into cells and then calculating the angular momentum by averaging over all particles in the cell ( * cell method * ) .",
    "these cells are then used to plot the cumulative distribution . in the particle method described above it is possible to derive both the differential and cumulative profiles while in the cell method",
    "only latter is possible owing to the small number of cells , typically around 60 .",
    "furthermore , the cells are assumed to have a spherically symmetric geometry .",
    "each cell covers a full @xmath274 range in @xmath275 and they span the range of @xmath276 from ( 0,0 ) to ( 1,1 ) .",
    "the radial shells are spaced such that each of them contains the same number of particles .",
    "the shells are then divided into 3 azimuthal cells of equal volume between @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "positions with same @xmath279 above and below the plane belong to same cell . for our calculations",
    "we divide the halo into 60 cells with approximately constant number of particles in each of them .",
    "we call this method * symmetrical cell method*. the symmetrical cell method is more effective in reducing the negative am material compared to particle method",
    ". however the resulting amd might be biased if the system is not axis symmetric .",
    "we therefore repeat the analysis with a modified scheme which is free from any inherent symmetry .",
    "we divide the halo into 4 radial shells with the @xmath280 shell containing @xmath281 particle ( @xmath282 and @xmath283 ) .",
    "each shell is divided into @xmath284 polar zones denoted by @xmath90 .",
    "each @xmath90 region is divided into @xmath285 azimuthal zones .",

    "the distribution of @xmath25 was found to satisfy a log - normal distribution with @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "our simulations reproduce these findings as shown in ( second row ) .",

    "* henceforth cj03 ) have also analyzed the amds for both gas and dm components .",
    "they found that @xmath25 is higher for gas than that for dm and also that @xmath3 is lower for gas .",
    "results of our simulations agree quite well with the findings of cj02 and cj03 .",
    "we find that for dm @xmath289 for @xmath291 of halo while for gas @xmath289 for @xmath292 of halos .",
    "@xmath139 for dm is @xmath293 while for gas it is @xmath294 .",
    "we also find @xmath25 to be higher for gas compared to dm ( second panel ) by using the same methods for analysis as done by above authors .",
    "however , we observed that the @xmath25 values obtained from fitting @xmath24 vs @xmath5 data are sensitive to the fitting procedure and error bars used .",
    "in fact two techniques can be used to fit @xmath25 profiles each giving slightly different results . the analytic function for the @xmath25 profiles",
    "is given by @xmath295 @xmath296 can be written in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath25 as @xmath297 where @xmath298 .",
    "this makes the @xmath25 profiles a one parameter fit for a halo with a given @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath299 we call this the * constant @xmath300 fits*. alternatively the @xmath25 profiles have an implicit maximum specific angular momentum @xmath301 . writing in terms of @xmath302 @xmath303 for a given halo in simulations",
    "@xmath304 is the specific am of the cell having maximum specific am .",
    "this is again a one parameter fit which we call * constant @xmath305 fits*.    in b2001 it was shown that for dm the error bars on values of @xmath5 for dm can be approximated by @xmath306 .",
    "the velocity dispersions are in general not homogeneous throughout the halo .",
    "cj03 therefore base their analysis on error bars estimated by @xmath307 . however , gas particles have a much smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "we therefore use a scheme in which the error are estimated by @xmath308 , where @xmath309 is the standard deviation calculated over the particles in the cell . for the cumulative distribution @xmath101 vs @xmath5",
    ", @xmath209 gives the error along j - axis .",
    "we estimate the error along @xmath310 axis by @xmath311 . to calculate @xmath312 we first fit the data with a @xmath25 or @xmath8 profile and then use this value of @xmath25 or @xmath8 to calculate @xmath312 .",
    "amds obtained by both particle and cell methods along with corresponding @xmath25 and @xmath8 fits are shown in , , and .",
    "we find that for constant @xmath304 fits @xmath313 in agreement with cj03 ( and , second row ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath314 can be roughly fit by a gaussian and the fit parameters for dm are similar to those in b2001 .",
    "for constant @xmath4 fits however , we find that @xmath315 is nearly same as @xmath316 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that the constant @xmath304 fits are constrained by construction to satisfy @xmath317 at @xmath318 , so the error in the value of @xmath304 is not taken into account in the fitting procedure .",
    "moreover the fits are not constrained to satisfy . for constant @xmath4 fits and",
    "also the @xmath8 fits this is not the case , the curves do not necessarily truncate at @xmath318 : they may extend to @xmath319 or may already stop at @xmath320 ( ) . there is a systematic trend such that for cases where @xmath25 is high ( in constant @xmath304 fits ) , the constant @xmath4 fits truncate at @xmath319 , resulting in a lower value of @xmath25 .",
    "the dm does not have high values of @xmath25 so it is relatively unaffected while gas has relatively high values of @xmath25 and is significantly affected . in other words , the effect that @xmath313 is diminished to a large extent in the constant @xmath4 fits .",
    "the distributions of @xmath321 and @xmath17 also show only a mild bias , ( second row ) .",
    "about @xmath322 of halos had @xmath323 but out of these for @xmath324 of halos the fits were poor so they were rejected .",
    "after correction only @xmath325 of halos have @xmath326 for gas , while for dm the percentage is about @xmath288 ( ) .    changing the geometry of the cells changes the distributions of @xmath25 and @xmath8 slightly .",
    "the peak position and width of the distributions are both reduced . a smaller percentage of halos have @xmath326 .",
    "we address the reason for these results in the next section .",
    "it was shown in vb2002 that the am profiles of gas and dm are remarkably similar , if not identical , when the velocities of gas were broadened by their microscopic thermal motion ( ) . however ,",
    "if the shape of the profiles after broadening is determined primarily by the value of @xmath63 and is thus insensitive to the original shape , then different profiles can be made to look similar by broadening with same @xmath63 .",
    "we demonstrate this in where we broaden the streaming velocities of 6 halos , each with a unique amd , with same velocity dispersion @xmath327 . although the initial profiles were quite different , the profiles after broadening are very similar .",
    "we conclude that thermal broadening masks out the uniqueness of un - broadened amds and hence is not a suitable technique for making comparisons .      rather than broadening we consider smoothening of the dm velocities as the superior procedure , i.e.  we extract streaming velocity @xmath266 from the given velocity @xmath328 and",
    "then compare their amd with that of gas .",
    "increasing the numbers of neighbors @xmath329 , over which the smoothing is applied , will decrease @xmath3 but then the region over which averaging is done eventually becomes too large and any significant information is lost .",
    "furthermore , particles close to the rotation axis suffer an apparent loss of am due to a geometrical effect : @xmath330 and @xmath331 in the inner region are zero for a symmetric rotating system aligned along @xmath82 axis .",
    "alternatively we may smooth the am instead ( the halo should be centered before smoothening ) . in this case",
    "we encounter the following problem : particles close to the axis and in a conical region around it get enhanced in am while those along the equator suffer a loss in am due to the existence of a strong density gradient",
    ". a spherical volume around such a typical particle has more neighbors towards the symmetry axis with lower am than away from it , so the smoothed am which has a radial dependence given by @xmath332 , is lower close to the axis .",
    "this effect was not prominent when the smoothening was done on velocities because the velocity does not exhibit a strong radial dependence ( @xmath333 ) .",
    "this suggests that a better method would be to smooth the velocities in cylindrical co - ordinates .",
    "for our analysis here we use the technique of smoothening the angular momentum only and we choose the number of neighbors to be 400 . instead of an sph type kernel we use a simple step function , which is equivalent to taking the mean over the neighbors .",
    "this makes it easier to make comparisons with the cell method and is also more effective in reducing @xmath3 .    in ( )",
    "the effect of smoothening on the distributions of angular momentum is shown .",
    "for some halos the profiles of gas and dm are similar after smoothening and for some they are different .",
    "this kind of comparison is not very useful because the shape of @xmath334 vs @xmath90 plots depends on @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "so a good agreement may merely reflect that the @xmath4 and @xmath3 are similar for gas and dm .",
    "moreover @xmath4 and @xmath3 are in general not same for gas and dm , this makes the interpretations of these plots even more difficult .",
    "so to make a comparison first we need to take out the dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath3 which can be done by plotting @xmath242 vs @xmath98 for the positive tails of gas and dm and then comparing the best fit values of @xmath25 or @xmath8 .",
    "this is shown in .",
    "we bin the smoothed profiles such that each bin contains @xmath335 particles . for calculating the error",
    "bars we use the same technique as described earlier in the case of the cell method , with the exception that we assume @xmath336 . for dm @xmath337 and with @xmath338",
    "this gives a value of 0.25 . for gas @xmath339 and",
    "this gives a value of 0.04 .",
    "the smoothed profiles can be fit by both bullock @xmath25 profiles ( only constant @xmath4 fits are used ) and the generalized @xmath8 profiles . @xmath242",
    "vs @xmath98 differential plots in show that that the bullock profiles are shallower for large @xmath98 , i.e. the actual amds are steeper than @xmath340 in outer parts .",
    "the particle profiles do not truncate abruptly like in the cell method , the slope gradually goes to zero .",
    "the @xmath8 profiles provide better fit to the particle profiles in outer regions .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath8 values obtained by particle method are also larger for gas as compared to that of dm ( and ) . @xmath314 and @xmath9 distributions are roughly gaussian . the mean , median and standard deviation are shown in and .",
    "@xmath326 for about @xmath341 of gas halos while none of the dm halos have @xmath326 .",
    "even after smoothening with same number of neighbors in particle method @xmath3 on average is greater for dm ( @xmath342 ) than for gas ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "similar effect is also seen in cell method where the cell size used is same for both dm and gas .",
    "a comparison of results of particle method with that of symmetrical cell method show that @xmath25 ( constant @xmath4 fits ) and @xmath8 are higher for symmetrical cell method .",
    "@xmath25 specifically is higher because @xmath344 to which it is directly related is about @xmath345 times higher in particle method than in symmetrical cell method ( , ) although the number of neighbors in particle method is approximately the same as the number of particles in each cell .",
    "@xmath3 is also significantly lower in symmetrical cell method than in particle method ( ) . since smoothening is a local effect whereas cell averaging is not due to its spherical and symmetric construction .",
    "so a blob of negative am or higher am material will retain its character when smoothed but will be averaged out in cell method over regions that are not necessarily local .",
    "both methods will deliver identical results only in the case where the system is symmetrical .",
    "any deviation from symmetry , in the symmetrical cell method has the effect of lowering the low am material by mixing it with high am one and vice versa .",
    "so both @xmath3 and @xmath344 are lower in symmetrical cell method .",
    "@xmath8 does not depend upon @xmath344 but is only affected by the lowering of low am material and this effect is not very strong so it shows only a slight change .",
    "these arguments also imply that the results of normal cell method should be very similar to particle method .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be seen in where distribution of @xmath3 for normal cell method is very similar to particle method .",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath25 parameter for particle method is also closer to normal cell method than the symmetrical cell method as shown in . in spite of the similarities",
    "there are subtle differences specially for gas whose @xmath346 is much lower for the case of normal cell method",
    ". this discrepancy may be because the number of particles in the normal cell is not fixed for all halos like in particle method for which the number is 400 .",
    "compared to normal cell method the particle method has slightly lower values of @xmath25 because their @xmath344 is slightly higher and this is because am is a monotonically increasing function of radius and for a cell of finite radial thickness the average am of the cell will always be less than the maximum am of particles in it .",
    "the above discussion suggests that both gas and dm should have significant asymmetry .",
    "we verify this as follows : we measure the asymmetry by dividing the halo into cells as described earlier but this time each radial shell is also divided into 6 azimuthal zones and 3 @xmath77 zones .",
    "then we measure the @xmath82 component of angular momentum vector @xmath347 and @xmath348 for a pair of cells with opposite parity situated at @xmath349 and @xmath350 where @xmath351 .",
    "symmetry of @xmath5 distribution within a halo is given by @xmath352 @xmath353 can vary from -1 ( perfectly anti - symmetric system ) to 1 ( perfectly symmetric system ) .",
    "an asymmetry as high as @xmath354 corresponds to @xmath353 of only 0.8 .",
    "@xmath355 , the mean over all halos , is found to be 0.78 for dm and 0.83 for gas .",
    "so in halos both gas and dm have significant asymmetry as expected .",
    "dm in fact is more asymmetrically distributed than gas .",
    "it might sound strange that two different functional forms are being used to describe the same data .",
    "but it is not very surprising considering the fact that the profiles can not be perfectly described by a functional form , they have small deviations and this gives enough room to both @xmath25 or @xmath8 profiles ( which after all are not very different ) to be used to fit them with equally good fits .",
    "the profiles from the cell method ( symmetrical ) tend to have an abrupt truncation at @xmath318 for some cases ( probably due to the symmetry effects discussed in previous section and also because the number of data points used to sample the profile , which is the total number of cells is small , typically around @xmath356 ) .",
    "so @xmath25 profiles which by design have an abrupt truncation at @xmath318 perform better in the outer regions for these cases , but for the same reason they are not able to fit the particle profiles in the outer regions which have a smooth extended tail .",
    "the @xmath8 profiles fare better for these .",
    "so if we neglect the outer parts @xmath357 then both the profiles provide a satisfactory fit to the distributions from both methods . to get an estimate of the quality of the fits ,",
    "we measure @xmath358 for data points with @xmath359 for both profiles .",
    "@xmath358 is defined as @xmath360 for each of the fits . to make a comparison we calculate the median of @xmath361 and median of @xmath362 over all the halos . if the @xmath358 for both of them are equal then the former quantity is close to zero .",
    "a negative value of -1 implies @xmath363 .",
    "if the median of @xmath362 is close to 1 then both fits are good for equal percentage of halos .",

    "we have presented here results from the non - radiative hydrodynamical simulation of 41 high resolution halos whose masses were selected to span the range from dwarf to bright galaxies .",
    "our investigation mainly focused on the angular momentum properties of the halos and whether there are systematic differences between gas and dark matter .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .   we investigated some of the global angular momentum properties like spin parameter @xmath4 , fraction of negative angular momentum @xmath3 and misalignment angle @xmath77 .",
    "we find the spin parameter of gas to be on average larger than that of dm and this effect is systematically more pronounced at lower redshifts . at @xmath43 @xmath370 , which is in agreement with the result reported by cj02 , but is not in agreement with vb2002 who do not find any such bias .",
    "the mean of the misalignment angle @xmath77 is @xmath2 which is again in agreement with cj02 who get a value @xmath371 but is less than the value of @xmath372 obtained by vb2002 .",
    "both these discrepancies could be due to the inclusion of a large number of low resolution halos in the analysis of vb2002 .",
    "the counter - rotating fraction @xmath3 is anti - correlated with @xmath4 and for gas @xmath3 decreases with decrease of redshift , an effect that can be explained by the increasing level of thermalization at lower redshifts .",
    "other than this there is little evolution of other properties with redshift .",
    "we find that the fraction of material with negative angular momentum can be described by the equation @xmath373 , with @xmath374 being a gaussian integral .",
    "to understand these effects we developed a toy model , where we introduce an ordered velocity @xmath163 which is smeared by means of gaussian random motion with dispersion @xmath63 .",
    "this model reproduces the @xmath375 correlation and suggests an actual relation of @xmath376 where @xmath377 .",
    "this relation is demonstrated to be in excellent agreement with the results from simulations .",
    "we also see that the gas gets more and more thermalized at lower redshift resulting in @xmath378 to be smaller at lower redshifts , whereas @xmath4 and concentration @xmath188 increases at lower redshifts .",
    "all these effects are contributing to the decrease of the amount of gas with negative angular momentum .",
    "the model also reproduces well the shape of amd observed in simulations .",
    "3 .   we study the distribution of angular momentum in detail , and compare and contrast various different techniques used to derive angular momentum distributions .",
    "we first use the cell method as proposed by b2001 and reproduce the result of cj03 that @xmath25 for gas is greater than that of dm .",
    "we find that the results are sensitive to the very details of the method employed for fitting .",
    "in particular the effect of gas having higher @xmath25 is diminished to a large extent if fits are performed assuming a constant @xmath4 rather than a constant @xmath379 .",
    "according to cj03 @xmath25 for gas is comfortably in the range required by observation of disk galaxies which is ( @xmath380 ) .",
    "we also find that about @xmath272 of halos have @xmath381 .",

    "we find that a generalized profile , based on gamma distribution , with a single parameter @xmath8 can be used to fit the amd of model galaxies ( exponential disks embedded in nfw halos ) as well as amd of gas and dm in simulations .",
    "@xmath382 seems to resemble the profiles of dwarf galaxies shown in bbs01 , a condition that is only obeyed by a small minority of halos ( less than @xmath325 ) . for fits based on the ( symmetric ) cell method only @xmath325 of the halos have gas with @xmath323 ( after rejecting halos with bad fits ) . for particle method and normal cell method",
    "the percentage is even lower , about @xmath383 of halos have @xmath326 .",
    "we find the particle method to be more robust , with data that is less noisy and also free from any artifical non local averaging or any symmetry assumptions .",
    "the profile in particle method do not have abrupt truncation like in cell method ( symmetrical ) and are more extended .",
    "this may have important implications for the truncation radius and extent of gas in real disks : in semi analytical models the distribution and extent of cold gas depends upon the amd used for the models . in @xcite(fig-9 there ) the models have an amd with @xmath25 between 1.6 and 1.9 , and the disks are predicted to have a sharp truncation ( @xmath384 ) of cold gas which is in disagreement with observed distribution of hi in galaxies ( @xmath385 ) . here @xmath386 is the maximum extent of gas with non zero surface density and @xmath387 is the radius with surface density of @xmath388 .",
    "5 .   for the particle method",
    ", there is a significant fraction of counter - rotating matter which has been excluded in calculating @xmath8 .",
    "the final amd ( and therefore the predicted structure of the model galaxy ) will depend strongly upon how this material eventually gets mixed up with the remaining portion of the halo , during the assembly of the galaxy .",
    "we saw that the counter - rotating matter undergoes extensive mixing during the history of its formation in the hierarchical framework .",
    "but the situation we have here is slightly different as it concerns the fate of the counter - rotating gas in an isolated halo when subjected to collapse . in the absence of any information it is best not to assume any preferential mixing with low , or high am material or also equal am material in which case it might form a non rotating bulge as prescribed in vb2002 .",
    "the most plausible prescription seems to be that of random mixing : during collapse the counter - rotating matter will follow a slightly different trajectory than normal matter around it and in the process it will get mixed by shocks with matter of various different am along its path .",
    "this process does not seem to have any preference .",
    "if we assume that the process of mixing will not change the distribution of @xmath8 significantly , we can conclude that less than @xmath325 of halos have @xmath326 .",
    "in other words only the absolute minority of halos have am distributions that resembles that of an observed ( dwarf or lsb ) disk galaxy . in the absence of any significant correlation of @xmath8 with mass @xmath389 or for that matter with any other halo parameter ,",
    "this leads us to the general conclusion that a typical halo in @xmath0 simulation has far too much low angular momentum material to account for majority galaxies featuring a dominated disk component .",
    "if the angular momentum of each element is conserved then low angular momentum material has to be preferentially discarded during the process of galaxy formation , this might be effected by means of supernova feedback during star formation that drives out gas from small halos that come randomly from all direction and contribute mainly to the low angular momentum material as shown by @xcite .",
    "the amd of bright galaxies in @xcite , which are effected little by feedback , seems to have @xmath390 ( no dip in amd for small s ) , consistent with am profile of a galaxy with a bulge which accounts for the low am material .",
    "it is no way similar to exponential disk with flat rotation curves as claimed there , because that would imply an @xmath252 and will be reflected as a prominent dip .",
