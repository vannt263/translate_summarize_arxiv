    "it means that even at @xmath1 k , atoms still vibrate around equilibrium positions , and as a result of the nonlinear interaction , their averaged vibrational displacements is about 1@xmath0 of lattice constant from equilibrium positions .",

    "[ fig_midline ] shows the position for midline in swcnt along the @xmath60 axis at @xmath64 k. this figure indicates the bending vibration directly .",

    "the radial cte is negative in low temperature region where other high energy vibration modes are not excited .",
    "a general behavior in both fig .",
    "[ fig_cte_r ]  ( a ) and ( b ) is that the thinner swcnt ( with higher aspect ratio length / diameter , @xmath12 ) has smaller value of @xmath75 and larger negative cte region .",
    "this is mainly because the bending vibration in thinner swcnt is more intense ( see fig .  [ fig_midline ] ) .",
    "for swcnt with different diameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cte_r ]  ( b ) , there is one more reason . in swcnt ,",
    "another important vibrational mode in the radial direction is the radial breathing mode .",
    "this mode can make the swcnt expand in the radial direction .",
    "the frequency of the radial breathing mode is inverse proportional to diameter .",
    "so in swcnt , the larger the diameter , the smaller the frequency of radial breathing mode .",
    "therefore , more positive contribution at low temperatures will lead to larger value of @xmath75 .",
    "the competition between the bending vibration and the radial breathing vibration gives a valley in all curves of @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig_cte_r ] .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is typically one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath73 . because along the axial of swcnt there are some high frequency optical phonon modes , which lead to strong expansion in the axial direction .",
    "another reason is that along the circular direction , swcnt forms a closed configuration , which makes it more difficult to expand in the radial direction . while in the axial direction ,",
    "the right side is open and expansion along this direction is easier . in fig .",
    "[ fig_cte_r ]  ( a ) , the cte does not show convergence behavior with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "this is mainly due to very serious bending vibration in long swcnt . as a result of this strong bending movement",

    "[ 1.1 ] is from 0 to 10 ev/(@xmath77.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    now we turn to the thermal expansion in graphene .",
    "graphene is easily bent due to its two - dimensional elastic sheet configuration .",
    "so in the experiment it is very difficult to hang a graphene sheet by just holding it on one side ( e.g. left side as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg ]  ( b ) ) . furthermore , to study the thermal expansion effect , one can not suspend the graphene sheet by fixing both left and right sides .",
    "the only reasonable choice is to put the graphene sample on a substrate . in this situation , the substrate can support the graphene stably .",
    "but in the mean time , interactions between the substrate and graphene will affect the bending vibration seriously , thus influences the measured value for cte in graphene sheet . in the following we focus on this substrate effect on the cte in graphene sheet .    the interaction between substrate and carbon atoms in graphene",
    "can be described by the on - site potential in the @xmath62 direction@xcite : @xmath78 with @xmath13 as the interaction force constant in unit of ev/(@xmath16u ) .",
    "@xmath79 is the vibrational displacement in the @xmath62 direction .",
    "[ fig_cte_graphene ] is the cte of graphene with 204 atoms for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "cte is very sensitive to @xmath13 .",
    "when there is no substrate interaction the bending vibration is very strong ( which has negative effect on cte ) , so the cte is very small in the high temperature limit , and a large negative cte region occurs at low temperatures . at @xmath6",
    "k , @xmath80 k@xmath3 .",
    "this value agrees with the very recent experimental result of @xmath4 k@xmath3.@xcite however , when the substrate interaction is introduced , even a very small value of @xmath15 , can significantly enhance the value of cte .",
    "furthermore , the negative cte region considerably shrinks .",
    "after further increasing interaction , the value of cte is further increased ; the negative cte region is further reduced and disappears after @xmath81 .",
    "a saturate value for cte is obtained after @xmath82 , where the bending vibration has been suppressed completely by the substrate interaction .",
    "we should pointout that the value of @xmath15 is actually only about 0.06@xmath0 of the interaction between carbon atoms in the two - dimensional graphene sheet@xcite which is more than 1.67 ev/(@xmath16u ) .",
    "the practical experimental substrate interaction might be larger than this value .",
    "so the measured value of cte will be higher than the curve with @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig_cte_graphene ] .",
    "if the experimental substrate interaction is larger than @xmath81 , no negative cte should be observed . by the way , if we compare the saturated value at high temperatures with that in the swcnt as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cte_a_t ] , we find that the value of cte in graphene is much larger than swcnt .",
    "this fact implies that the bending vibration in the swcnt is also very important for the axial cte .",
    "it considerably reduce the value of axial cte without causing negative axial cte in swcnt .",
    "in conclusion , the gf method has been applied to investigate the cte in swcnt and graphene .",
