    "information may be effectively manipulated and transmitted by encoding symbols into quantum states . however , besides several advantages , the quantum nature of the transmitted signals entails some drawback , the most relevant owing to the so - called _ no - cloning _ theorem : quantum information encoded in a set of nonorthogonal states can not be copied @xcite . in order to overcome this limitation an orthogonal coding",

    "we provide a full classification of cloning machines , based on the number of parameters needed to specify the class .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : clom ] we introduce the concept of cloning machine for a class of observables and illustrate some basic properties .",

    "we consider a device in which a signal qubit ( say , qubit `` 1 '' ) is prepared in the ( unknown ) state @xmath0 and then interacts , via a given unitary @xmath1 , with a probe qubit ( `` 2 '' ) prepared in the known state @xmath2 . for a given class of qubit observables @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a subset of the real axis and @xmath5 $ ] , we introduce the concept of cloning as follows . a cloning machine for the class of observables @xmath6 is a triple @xmath7 such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is the mean value of the observable @xmath10 at the input and @xmath11 \\quad { \\overline{\\rm x}}_2 \\equiv \\hbox{tr}_{12}\\left [ r\\ : i \\otimes { { \\rm x}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the mean values of the same observable on the two output qubits ( see fig .",

    "this is justified by the fact that for any single - qubit observable @xmath15 the cloning of the mean value is equivalent to the cloning of the whole statistics .",

    "in fact , in view of the duality among states and operators on an hilbert space , one may argue that a proper figure of merit to assess a cloning machine for observables would be a fidelity  like one .",
    "this is certainly true for the @xmath21-dimensional case , @xmath22 , while for qubit systems a proper assessment can be also made in term of mean  value duplication , which subsumes all the information carried by the signal .",
    "our goal is now to classify cloning machines according to the number of parameters needed to fully specify the class of observables under investigation . before beginning our analysis",
    "let us illustrate a basic property of cloning machines , which follows from the definition , and which will be extensively used throughout the paper .",
    "given a cloning machine @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a cloning machine too , where @xmath25 and the class @xmath26 is formed by the observables @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
