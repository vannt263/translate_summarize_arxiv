    "a _ wheel _ is a graph formed by a chordless cycle @xmath0 , called the _ rim _ , and a vertex @xmath1 ( not in @xmath2 ) , called the _ center _",
    ", such that the center has at least three neighbors on the rim .",
    "so , the complete graph on four vertices is the smallest wheel .",
    "when convenient , we denote a wheel by @xmath3 .",
    "wheels are one of the four _ truemper s configurations _ , see  @xcite , that play a role in several theorems on the structure of graphs and matroids .",
    "let us see more precisely how wheels play some role in the description of the structure of several graph classes .",
    "a _ hole _ in a graph is a chordless cycle on at least four vertices .",
    "the structure of a _ berge graph _",
    "@xmath4 , that is a graph such that @xmath4 and its complement do not contain odd holes , is studied in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained there famously settled the strong perfect graph conjecture .",
    "the proof goes through several cases , and the last fifty pages of the proof deal with the case when @xmath4 contains certain kinds of wheels .",
    "consequently the structure of a berge graph @xmath4 is simpler when @xmath4 does not contain these kinds of wheels .",
    "in addition , the structure of a graph @xmath4 with no even holes is complex .",
    "a first decomposition theorem was given in @xcite and a better one in @xcite . in the later paper , very long arguments are devoted to situations when @xmath4 contains certain kinds of wheels .",
    "this suggests that graphs that do not contain a wheel as an induced subgraph should have interesting structural properties .",
    "understanding this structure might shed a new light on the works listed above .",
    "since `` understanding the structure '' is a slightly fuzzy goal , we adress the following precise open questions .    *",
    "* is there a constant @xmath5 such that every graph with no wheel as an induced subgraph is @xmath5-colorable ?",
    "* question .",
    "* is there a polynomial - time algorithm to decide whether an input graph contains a wheel as an induced subgraph ?",
    "as observed by esperet and stehlk  @xcite , a classical construction of triangle - free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number , due to zykov  @xcite , shows that the constant @xmath5 in the first question must be at least  4 .",
    "this can also be deduced from the graph represented in figure  [ fig : r ] : @xmath6 does not contain a wheel as an induced subgraph , but has no 3-coloring because it has 13 vertices and stability number @xmath7 .",
    ", that is the unique graph @xmath4 satisfying @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10.[fig : r ] ]    the above questions seem difficult and it might be of interest to study subclasses of graphs with no wheels as induced subgraphs .",
    "two such classes have already been studied ( but not motivated by the study of wheel - free graphs ) .",
    "first , note that any wheel different from @xmath11 contains a cycle with a unique chord .",
    "so , graphs with no wheels as induced subgraphs is a superclass of graphs with no cycles with a unique chord and no @xmath11 . these graphs have a precise structural description , see  @xcite .    a natural subclass of graphs with no wheel as an induced subgraph is the class of graphs that do not contain a subdivision of a wheel as an induced subgraph .",
    "it is easy to see that this class of graphs is precisely the class of graphs with no wheel and no subdivision of @xmath11 as a induced subgraphs .",
    "it turns out that the structure of a graph @xmath4 with no induced subdivision of @xmath11 is investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the proof goes through several cases : when @xmath4 contains @xmath12 , when @xmath4 contains a _ prism _ ( another truemper s configuration , not worth defining here ) , and when @xmath4 contains a wheel .",
    "this last case seems to be the most difficult : no satisfactory structural description is found in this case , whereas when excluding induced wheels , a very precise structure theorem is given , with several consequences .",
    "for instance , it is proved that every graph that does not contain a subdivision of @xmath11 or a wheel ( as induced subgraphs ) is 3-colorable .    here",
    "we restrict our attention to another subclass : graphs with no wheels _ as subgraphs_. so , from here on , _ contain _ and",
    "_ -free _ refer to the subgraph containement relation .    in section  [ sec : zoo ]",
    "we show several examples of wheel - free graphs",
    ". this will give insight to the reader and also shows that the results presented here apply to a class of graphs that is not empty . in section  [ sec : menger ] , we prove several technical lemmas that are all slight variations on menger s theorem needed in the rest of the paper . in section  [ s : sd ] , we study the connectivity of wheel - free graphs .",
    "the main result here is that every 3-connected wheel - free graph is in fact minimally 3-connected . as a direct application",
    ", we prove that any wheel - free graph has a vertex of degree at most  3 .",
    "this is a particular case of the following theorem due to turner .",
    "[ th : turner ] let @xmath13 be an integer and @xmath4 be a graph that does not contain a cycle together with a vertex that has at least @xmath14 neighbors in the cycle",
    ". then , @xmath4 has at least one vertex of degree at most @xmath14 .",
    "note that the result stated in @xcite is slightly weaker than theorem  [ th : turner ] , but the proof given by turner in @xcite exactly proves the version given here .",
    "we still include our proof that wheel - free graphs have vertices of degree at most  3 in section  [ s : sd ] .",
    "it is not as direct as turner s , but it illustrates some technics that we use later .",
    "also , with the same method , we prove that every planar wheel - free graph has a vertex of degree at most  2 .    in a wheel - free graph ,",
    "any vertex @xmath1 with three neighbors",
    "@xmath15 is such that deleting @xmath1 results in a graph where no cycle goes through @xmath16 . in section  [ s:3ic ]",
    ", we recall a theorem due to watkins and mesner  @xcite , that describes the structure of a graph where no cycle goes through three given vertices @xmath15 .",
    "we give a new shorter proof of this theorem . in section  [ sec :",
    "twin ] we give an application of it : we prove that any 3-connected wheel - free graph contains a pair of vertices that are not adjacent and have exactly the same neighborhood .",
    "in fact , we need to prove slightly more : the outcome holds not only for wheel - free graphs , but also for a slightly larger class of graphs : _ almost wheel - free graphs _",
    "( to be defined later ) .",
    "this result is then used in section  [ sec : col ] to give a new proof of the following .",
    "[ th:2ort ] every wheel - free graph contains either a vertex of degree at most 2 or a pair of non - adjacent vertices of degree  3 that have the same neighborhood .",
    "as already observed by thomassen and toft , this implies the following .",
    "[ th : col ] every wheel - free graph is 3-colorable .    by induction on the number of vertices of a wheel - free graph @xmath4 . if @xmath17 , then @xmath4 is 3-colorable .",
    "otherwise , by theorem  [ th:2ort ] , either @xmath4 contains a vertex @xmath18 of degree at most  2 , or a pair @xmath19 of non - adjacent vertices with the same neighborhood . in the first case",
    ", we color @xmath20 by the induction hypothesis , and give to @xmath18 one of the three colors not used in its neighborhood . in the second case , we color @xmath21 by the induction hypothesis , and give to @xmath22 the same color as @xmath1 .    in several papers about truemper s configurations , rims of wheels",
    "are required to be of length at least  4 , i.e.  @xmath11 does not count as a wheel . in section  [ sec : long ] , we show that this requirement does not matter much for what we are doing here : any graph that does not contain a wheel with a rim of length at least  4 is 4-colorable .",
    "wheel - free graphs with quite arbitrary shapes can be obtained by taking any graph , and subdividing edges until every vertex of degree at least  3 has all its neighbors ( except possibly  2 ) of degree at most  2 . indeed in a graph obtained that way , no vertex can be the center of a wheel .",
    "but those graphs are not 3-connected ( they have vertices of degree  2 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : some3c ] , several 3-connected wheel - free graphs are represented .",

    "note that to prove the theorem above , we do not need the full strength of theorem  [ th : col ] . knowing that wheel - free graphs are 4-colorable is enough , and follows easily from theorem  [ th : turner ] or theorem  [ th : deg3 ] .",
    "thanks to louis esperet and matj stehlk for useful discussions and for pointing out to us a graph with chromatic number  4 , no triangle and no wheel as an induced subgraph .",
    "thanks to frdric maffray for pointing out to us the paper of turner  @xcite ."
