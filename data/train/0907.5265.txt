    "now it is believed that as much as 2/3 of the total density of the universe is in a form which has large negative pressure and which is usually referred to as dark energy .",
    "it has been proposed number of various models aiming at the description of dark energy universe ( for review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is evidently that to have deceleration ( where @xmath0 ) and acceleration ( where @xmath1 ) phases it is necessary to have the moment with @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we show that the gravitating higgs scalar field may have cosmological solutions with such property .",
    "such solution exists only with a single value of cosmological constant .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that in the ordinary einstein gravity interacting with the higgs scalar field there exist solutions having the deceleration and acceleration phases .",
    "the corresponding einstein + scalar field equations are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is @xmath5 @xmath6 is the higgs field and the lagrangian for the scalar field is @xmath7 the quantity @xmath8 in eq . is identical to a cosmological constant .",
    "later we will see that @xmath8 is defined uniquely in a flex point @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",

    "the singular solution has one flex point only .",
    "the presented solution is symmetrical one relative to the bouncing off moment but there exist non - symmetrical solutions with the initial conditions different from .    the asymptotical behavior of the solution is @xmath27 where @xmath28 are constants .",
    "this solution can describe the inflation of universe with the posterior standard decay of the scalar field .",

    "additionally these solutions may have bouncing off from a cosmological singularity .",
    "the detailed investigation is made near the moment where the transition from the deceleration epoch to the acceleration one happens .",
    "one question remains not clear in the carried out research : is the solution with big @xmath44 regular or it has singularity either in the past ( big bang ) or and in the future ( big rip ) or both ?",
