    "@xcite-@xcite is well developed for pore - scale flow simulations and extended to model two - phase systems or two immiscible fluids @xcite-@xcite .",
    "after computing the effective parameters , we are able to perform darcy - scale simulations using traditional finite volume or element methods used in commercial reservoir simulators . however , these computations are limited to small revs ( compared to the computational grid ) and rely on two distinct idealized scale concepts",
    ".    flows at the darcy scale can also be modeled by lbm with a modified algorithm .",
    "the model described in @xcite allows particles to partially bounce back at the cells ( points ) with small permeability . in @xcite-@xcite , an external body force , which increases with decreasing permeability ,",
    "is employed to represent the resistance effect of the porous media to the fluid , where lbm is considered as a unified framework for simulations at all scales .",
    "however , these simulations require significant computational resources to converge since the permeability distribution usually has drastic changes in space , which requires a very fine grid for high spatial resolution . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we propose a upscaled lbm scheme that is applicable at the pore and coarser , e.g. , darcy scales .    following the work in @xcite where the generalized navier - stokes equation @xcite is solved , we simplify the equilibrium distribution function . in addition ,",

    "then , an upscaled lbm scheme is proposed to improve computational efficiency by using a coarse grid ( each coarse point represents a subdomain ) with effective permeability . for each subdomain ,",
    "the effective permeability is computed by a local scheme , which is based on the conservation principle for the average fluxes ( see @xcite for general overview of multiscale methods ) . to avoid the iterative process of finding the unknown effective permeability that satisfies the equation for the average flux , we derive an analytical formula .",
    "this analytical formula allows finding the average flux in terms of the effective permeability , which is then inversely determined from the computed average flux using the original permeability distribution in the subdomain concerned .",
    "the computed effective permeabilities are verified in several benchmark problems , where analytical solutions are known .",

    "the upscaled lbm approach is applied to single - phase flows ; however , this approach can be used for modeling multi - phase flow phenomena .",
    "in this section , we discuss lbm algorithms that will be used in our microscale simulations .",
