    "<S> an increase of @xmath5 or @xmath7 results in a decrease of the scattering rate @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by noting that , since both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are conserved in the tunneling process , an electron can tunnel from the metal to the semiconductor only if its vertical energy is equal to @xmath17 . however , according to ( [ eq_ez ] ) , @xmath17 shifts to lower energies with increasing @xmath5 or @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> because of that shift , the tunneling distance , which is equal to @xmath63 at the vertical energy @xmath17 , becomes longer as @xmath5 or @xmath7 increase .    </S>",

    "<S> the two models are in good general agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission function increases by one at each energy corresponding to a subband edge @xmath17 , indicating a resonant tunneling regime , and shows a decaying behavior between two successive subband edges . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , different energies correspond to different @xmath37 states . </S>",
    "<S> since the length of the contact @xmath6 is finite and the transfer length or average distance traveled by an electron in the semiconductor before tunneling into the metal is equal to the mean free path @xmath53 , the probability of escaping into the metal is larger for the states closer to the subband edge which have smaller velocity . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_tran ] , increasing the contact length tends to raise the transmission probability of each single subband to unity because the ratio @xmath65 between the contact length and the average distance before tunneling increases , which means that the electrons have more chances to enter the contact . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of @xmath17 to lower energy as @xmath7 or @xmath5 increase is clearly seen from the shift of the transmission peaks in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it should be noted that , with reference to the generic subband of index @xmath18 , our model predicts no vertical tunneling contribution at energies below @xmath17 ( see eq .  [ eq_transmission ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process could be possible in the case of a realistic band bending between the channel and the contact region . </S>",
    "<S> however , since tunneling is decreasing exponentially with the tunneling distance , the effect would be concentrated at the contact edge . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if @xmath17 is sufficiently close to the metal fermi level @xmath2 , the contribution from energies below @xmath17 ( lateral tunneling ) is negligible compared to energies above @xmath17 ( vertical tunneling ) because of the large surface - to - edge ratio of the contact .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig_cond]a shows that , at high electric field before the second subband starts to contribute significantly , the derivative @xmath66 is negative , i.e. , contact resistance decreases with decreasing temperature . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig_cond]b . </S>",
    "<S> it can be proved that its derivative with respect to temperature changes sign at the energy @xmath68 , which has only a weak temperature dependence ( @xmath69 and @xmath70  ev at @xmath71 and @xmath72  k , respectively ) and appears as a crossover point in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_cond]b . as the transmission function shifts to lower energy with increasing @xmath5 ( compare the plots at @xmath73 and @xmath74  v / nm in fig .  [ fig_cond]b ) , more contribution to the integral in ( [ eq_cond ] ) comes from the energy range where @xmath75 and eventually leads to @xmath76 .    </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath78 in this energy range , it follows that @xmath79 ( i.e. , an almost transparent barrier ) and ( [ eq_cond ] ) simplifies to @xmath80 if , in addition , @xmath81 , then ( [ eq_cond_approx1 ] ) further reduces to @xmath82 which is the expression of the thermionic emission theory for a 2d system @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> similar arrhenius plots are commonly used to extract the sb height in experiments @xcite . for the chosen set of parameter values , approximation ( [ eq_cond_approx1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is valid up to @xmath91  v / nm . at higher electric field , the transmission function becomes increasingly peaked around the subband edge ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig_cond]b ) and ( [ eq_cond_approx2 ] ) becomes a better approximation . </S>",
    "<S> a positive slope , or metallic behavior , is predicted at high electric field similar to what has been reported in experiments @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_cond]d , we plot the sb height obtained by fitting the data of the rigorous model in ( [ eq_cond ] ) with the thermionic expression ( [ eq_cond_thermionic ] ) , compared with the actual value of @xmath92 from ( [ eq_ez ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the extraction method based on the thermionic emission theory can provide good results at low electric field values , where the tunneling barrier is almost transparent . in the high - field regime , a fitting based on ( [ eq_cond_approx2 ] ) would provide a more physical result .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by noting that the model presented in this work can be easily extended to account for a finite carrier mobility in the semiconductor by introducing an additional relaxation time @xmath93 ( and a corresponding mean free path @xmath94 ) related to elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of scattering would be , for each subband , a shorter transfer length and a transmission probability that does saturate to unity in the limit of a long contact length . in the regime </S>",
    "<S> when only one subband is populated , the model could also be extended to include self - consistent electrostatics using the variational approach in @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions _ in summary , we have demonstrated that the metallic behavior of the contact resistance observed in recent experiments can be explained by taking into account the modulation of the vertical tunneling due to the sb lowering with increasing electric field in back - gated devices . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
