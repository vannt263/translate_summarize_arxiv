    "in a previous paper  @xcite we have enlightened the scenario where the higgs boson without self - interaction ( trivial higgs ) could coexist with spontaneous symmetry breaking . due to the peculiar rescaling of the higgs condensate ,",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and the physical @xmath3 is not the same as in perturbation theory .",
    "according to this picture one expects that the ratio @xmath4 would be a cutoff - independent constant .",

    "+ a cornerstone of the standard model is the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking that is mediated by the higgs boson . in fact",
    ", the discovery of the higgs boson is the highest priority of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "recently , both the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite reported the experimental results for the search of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider running at @xmath7 tev , based on a total integrated luminosity between 1 fb@xmath1 and 2.3 fb@xmath1 .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to further elaborate on the production mechanisms of our trivial higgs and to compare the theoretical expectations with selected available data from lhc .",
    "for higgs mass in the range @xmath8 the main production mechanism at lhc is the gluon fusion @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretical estimate of the production cross section at lhc for centre of mass energy @xmath10 is  @xcite : @xmath11 the gluon coupling to the higgs boson in the standard model is mediated by triangular loops of top and bottom quarks . since the yukawa coupling of the higgs particle to heavy quarks grows with quark mass , thus balancing the decrease of the triangle amplitude , the effective gluon coupling approaches a non - zero value for large loop - quark masses . on the other hand , we already argued  @xcite that the non trivial rescaling of the higgs condensate means that , if the fermions acquires a finite mass through the yukawa couplings , then the coupling of the physical higgs field to the fermions could be very different from the perturbative standard model higgs boson .",
    "however , the coupling of the higgs field to the gauge vector bosons is fixed by the gauge symmetries , therefore the coupling of the trivial higgs boson to the gauge vector bosons is the same as for the standard model higgs boson . for large higgs masses",
    "the vector - boson fusion mechanism becomes competitive to the gluon fusion higgs production  @xcite : @xmath12 the main difficulty in the experimental identification of a very heavy higgs ( @xmath13 ) resides in the large width which makes impossible to observe a mass peak .",
    "in fact , the expected mass spectrum of our trivial higgs should be proportional to the lorentzian distribution : @xmath14 where we assume the central value of the higgs mass according to eq .",

    "( [ 2.3 ] ) is the simplest distribution consistent with the heisenberg uncertainty principle and the finite lifetime @xmath16 .",
    "+ according to the triviality and spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario the higgs self - coupling vanishes so that the decay width is mainly given by the decays into pairs of massive gauge bosons : @xmath17 since the coupling of the trivial higgs to the gauge vector bosons is fixed by the local gauge symmetry , the decay width into gauge vector bosons is the same as in the case of the perturbative higgs boson , consequently  @xcite @xmath18 equation  ( [ 2.5 ] ) shows that in the high mass region @xmath19 gev the higgs total width depends strongly on @xmath2 . to take care of the energy dependence of the width in eq .",
