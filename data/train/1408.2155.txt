    "the ising model is one of the most studied models in statistical physics .",
    "we now have a well developed mathematical theory for it s behaviour in 2-dimensions @xcite , extensive numerical work in 3-dimensions , and it is known that the upper critical dimension for the model if @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath2 it is known that the model takes on it s mean field critical exponents in the thermodynamic limit . for finite systems far less is known rigorously and there has been a long running debate on differences in scaling for systems with free and cyclic boundaries @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite we found an hitherto overlooked way in which for @xmath3 the behaviour of the model depends strongly on the boundary condition , in fact so strongly that at the critical point the difference is not believed to vanish as the side @xmath0 of the system grows .",
    "this conclusion has been questioned @xcite by a group of authors which has earlier been promoting an alternative scaling picture for the case with free boundary conditions . however , in a recent paper we revisited this question with much larger system sizes and found a good agreement with our earlier results , and the standard scaling picture , where the susceptibility of the model with free boundary grows as @xmath4 and for cyclic boundary grows as @xmath5 .    in view of these results",
    "a natural question is why we should see a different behaviour for the case with cyclic boundary , and what the exact form of the scaling behaviour for this case should be for @xmath6 above the critical dimension .",
    "our approach to the answer of this question is via the random - cluster model .",
    "the fortuin - kasteleyn random cluster model , or rc - model for short , is a natural extension of the ising , potts and edge percolation models , all captured by varying @xmath7 , one of its two parameters , the other @xmath8 corresponding to the temperature in the first two models and the edge probability in the last .",
    "many properties of the ising model have direct interpretations in terms of the numbers and sizes of connected clusters in the rc - model . in particular the susceptibility corresponds to the average cluster size .",
    "for percolation , the case @xmath9 of the rc - model , aizenman @xcite conjectured that the largest clusters should scale as @xmath10 for @xmath11 with cyclic boundary , instead of @xmath12 for free boundary .",
    "one of the reasons for this conjecture was that this gives the same scaling as for the largest connected in the erds - renyi , or er for short , random graph with @xmath13 vertices at it s critical point , where the largest component has size proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "note that the er - random graph can be seen as the percolation model on the complete graph on @xmath13 vertices .",
    "this conjecture was proved in @xcite , and in @xcite it was proved that asymptotics of the same type as on the complete graph can be expected on a wider class of finite graphs as well .    as we have pointed out",
    "percolation is a special case of the rc - model and the latter has also been studied on the complete graph by mathematicians . in @xcite",
    "the critical probability was identified , the exponential asymptotics of the partition function was studied , and it was proved that the phase transition is of second order for @xmath15 and of first order for @xmath16 . later @xcite a more detailed study of the cluster structure was carried out , and it was found that there are three ranges of @xmath7 with distinct behaviour @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "our aim in this paper is to compare the behaviour of the largest and second largest cluster in the rc - model for @xmath18 , corresponding to the ising model , for 5-dimensional lattices with side @xmath0 and cyclic boundary .",
    "for the case @xmath19 @xcite identified no less than five distinct scaling regions near the critical probability for the complete graph , each with its own asymptotic behaviour for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the sizes of the largest and second largest clusters respectively .",
    "some of the regions are difficult to study , since in order to obtain correct scaling they would require far larger graphs than those used here .",
    "thus we have focused on three cases : i ) the high - temperature case ( fixed @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) , ii ) near @xmath24 at fixed @xmath25 , and iii ) near @xmath24 at fixed @xmath26 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are different @xmath0-dependent couplings .",
    "as we shall see , for these regions we have an excellent agreement between the scaling for the complete graph and for the 5-dimensional ising model with cyclic boundary .",
    "for a graph @xmath28 on @xmath29 vertices and @xmath30 edges the random cluster model s partition function is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of ( connected ) components , or clusters as we will call them , of the graph @xmath33 , i.e. the graph with vertex set @xmath34 and edge set @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are parameters to the distribution . the ising model without an external field , on the other hand , has the partition function @xmath38 where the sum is taken over all functions @xmath39 from @xmath34 to @xmath40 .",
    "thus vertex @xmath41 has spin @xmath42 .",
    "here the energy is @xmath43 , summed over all edges in @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 is the dimensionless coupling , or inverse temperature .",
    "the two models are actually equivalent for @xmath18 when setting @xmath46 .",
    "assuming we have a state @xmath47 from the random cluster distribution in equation  , we can obtain a state @xmath39 from the ising distribution   in the following way : for each component , pick a spin @xmath48 uniformly at random and assign this spin to all vertices of the component .",
    "going in the other direction is also easy .",
    "starting with a state @xmath39 from the ising distribution at coupling @xmath22 , let @xmath49 .",
    "now add each satisfied edge , i.e. edges @xmath50 with @xmath51 , to the set @xmath35 with probability @xmath46 . for more information on this",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this second scheme is a surprisingly efficient way of obtaining random cluster data .",
    "just start up your trusted ising state generator , whether it be metropolis , heat - bath or wolff cluster @xcite , and convert the ising states to correctly distributed random cluster states .",
    "all graphs studied here are 5-dimensional grid graphs with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. cartesian products of five cycles on @xmath0 vertices , so that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and we have used @xmath54 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 and 24 .",
    "we collected the data by generating ising states with the wolff cluster method  @xcite and then converting them to random cluster states using the scheme described above .    throughout",
    "we use the critical coupling @xmath55 @xcite , thus corresponding to the random cluster critical probablity @xmath56 , and denote one scaled temperature by @xmath57 and another by @xmath58 . recall that the critical temperature for a complete graph on @xmath59 vertices approaches zero as @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 .",
    "we will denote a scaled probability by @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63th central moment of a distribution is denoted by @xmath64 , the mean value by @xmath65 and the variance by @xmath66 .",
    "the standard deviation is then @xmath67 .",
    "the median is written @xmath68 .",
    "given a random cluster state @xmath35 the largest and second largest cluster size , i.e. the number of vertices in these clusters , is denoted @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "we will here give a very brief description of some of the relevant scaling results from @xcite for the complete graph on @xmath59 vertices .",
    "where relevant further details will be given in later sections .",
    "as proven in @xcite the critical probability is given by @xmath69 .",
    "now if @xmath70 then the model is not critical and depending on whether @xmath71 is less than 1 or greater than 1 we see behaviour corresponding to the high- and low - temperature regions respectively , with only small clusters in the first case and a large cluster , linear in @xmath59 sized , plus some small ones in the latter case .    if @xmath72 we are inside the critical window and need a finer parameterization of @xmath8 .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 can depend on @xmath59 .",
    "we now see five distinct regions inside the critical window :    1 .",
    "if @xmath75 then , asymptotically , all clusters are trees and small .",
    "2 .   if @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a constant , then @xmath20 is roughly of order @xmath78 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath79 but @xmath80 there exists a unique largest component and it s size is @xmath81 , for a value @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 , where @xmath77 is a constant , then @xmath20 is of order @xmath84 and @xmath21 is bounded by @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath86 and @xmath87 then @xmath20 is of order @xmath88 and @xmath21 of order @xmath89 .",
    "strictly speaking , the complete graph version of the high - temperature case only requires that @xmath90 . of course",
    ", a fixed @xmath91 will satisfy this condition .",
    "hence , for the 5d case we will simply test the case of a fixed @xmath22 for @xmath23 .    in @xcite it was shown that @xmath20 is distributed as an extreme - value distribution @xcite .",
