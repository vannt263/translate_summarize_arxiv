    "current understanding of interfacial electron transfer ( et ) kinetics is dominated by two theories , butler - volmer@xcite and marcus - hush@xcite , which both describe a one - electron transfer : @xmath2 the first , butler - volmer theory ( bv , equations [ bv red ] and [ bv ox ] ) , is well - reported and reliable for parameterisation@xcite , but is phenomenological , and therefore is unable to provide any detailed physical insights of a predictive nature .",
    "bv theory relates the electrode kinetics to the heterogeneous rate constants ( @xmath3 ) , the formal potential ( @xmath4 ) , and the transfer coefficient , @xmath5 , which empirically describes how product or reactant - like the transition state is@xcite .",

    "mh theory relates the heterogeneous rate constant to the reaction gibbs energy , @xmath7 , and reorganisation energy , @xmath8 : @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is shown in equation [ inner plus outer ] , the total reorganisation energy is the sum of contributions from inner sphere bond reorganisation energy ( @xmath10 ) and solvent reorganisation energy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these can be estimated separately , with the outer - sphere solvent reorganisation energy from the born - marcus solvation equation@xcite , and inner - sphere contributions from computational calculations ( for example , dft etc@xcite ) of changes in bond lengths and angles of the molecule .",
    "@xmath12    these two models have been used to analyse a range of electrochemical processes by cyclic voltammetry in aqueous@xcite and non - aqueous@xcite solvents . a comprehensive review by henstridge _ _ et al__@xcite concluded that smh theory struggles to adequately describe the voltammetric response of solution - phase redox couples whose transfer coefficients deviate significantly from 0.5 .",
    "a fourth parameter , @xmath13 , was introduced , which accounts for any differences between the inner - shell force constant of the reactant and the product , to create asymmetric marcus - hush theory ( amh ) .",
    "this refinement was explored in aqueous@xcite and non aqueous@xcite solvents and surface bound systems@xcite by laborda _",
    "et al _ , and it was concluded that amh was able to parameterise the experimental voltammetry at least as well as bv theory , and more accurately than smh theory .    the electroreduction of oxygen has been extensively studied in a variety of solvents@xcite .",
    "the product of the initial one - electron reduction , superoxide , is a highly nucleophilic ion that initiates further reactions with a proton source , if one is present in solution .",
    "however , in absence of a proton source , the superoxide ion is stable , and the reaction proceeds as a simple one electron transfer : @xmath14 et kinetics of irreversible oxygen reduction has been studied in - depth in aqueous solvents@xcite and values for the total reorganisation energy for the reduction of oxygen to superoxide have been estimated to lie between 1.26 - 4.51 ev@xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to rearrangement of the polar water molecules upon formation of the superoxide ions .",
    "room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) are molten salts with melting points below room temperature@xcite , and normally consist of a bulky , asymmetric organic cation , and an inorganic anion@xcite .",
    "ionic liquids are interesting solvents in which to examine the reversible one - electron reduction of oxygen , because the superoxide has been known to be stable , leading to quasi - reversible voltammetry in a range of ils.@xcite .",
    "lynden - bell has conducted a thorough study into the applicability of marcus theory to rtil solvents@xcite .",
    "it was suggested _ via _ simulation that the outer sphere reorganisation energy for redox processes in rtils will be similar to that for the same process in a non ionic polar solvent . in a polar solvent ,",
    "the molecules will re - orient themselves in response to the addition of charge , and in an ionic liquid the ions will translate themselves .",
    "it was predicted that these two processes produce similar reorganisation energies .",
    "the mechanism and et kinetics have been elucidated for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide in protic ionic liquids,@xcite and in hydrophobic rtils in the presence of water.@xcite as yet , the et kinetics of the one electron reduction of oxygen to superoxide in dry ionic solvents has not been studied , and no values for reorganisation energy for this process have been established .",

    "this will allow conclusions to be reached about the relative ability of each theory to parameterise experimental data .",
    "we consider a one electron reduction of an electroactive species : @xmath2 at a microdisc electrode , using both butler - volmer theory and symmetric marcus - hush theory to describe the electron transfer kinetics .",
    "cyclic voltammetry is simulated using both models , and both are subsequently compared to experimental data ( see section [ results and discussion ] ) .",
    "this study utilises microdisc electrodes , which offer several advantages over macroelectrodes .",
    "firstly , as the capacitance of the double layer is proportional to the size of the electrode , a consequence of the reduced size of the electrode will be naturally lower capacitance .",
    "secondly , the small currents passed reduce the ohmic drop and allow a two - electrode system to be employed@xcite .",

    "for all three values of @xmath102 , it is seen that large @xmath45 values produce the same limiting current as the butler - volmer model .",

    "the definition of @xmath102 in our dimensionless model is : @xmath108 lowering @xmath102 will therefore mean that either @xmath3 or @xmath17 is lowered , or @xmath109 is raised . lowering",
    "@xmath3 trivially means the electrochemical kinetics become more likely to be the limiting factor in the steady state current as opposed to diffusion .",
    "either lower @xmath17 or increasing @xmath109 also both lower @xmath102 and lead to a more kinetically limited current .",
    "this is due to the fact that either of these changes will increase mass transport efficiency to the electrode surface , thus making electrochemical kinetics the more limiting factor .",
    "therefore , in order to see a kinetically limited current , it is desirable to have a small @xmath3 , a small @xmath17 and a large @xmath109 .",
    "recent work by molina _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite shows that steady state voltammetry at an isolated spherical electrodes alone in solution , a spherical electrode supported on a conductive but inert surface and a microdisc electrode ( all shown schematically in fig .",

    "we now investigate if this relation holds under the marcus hush formalism over a wide range of @xmath102 and @xmath45 values .",

    "symmetric marcus - hush ( smh ) theory was next used to model the electrode kinetics , and the same procedure as outlined above was followed to establish independent , optimal values for the parameters of concern . in this case , the transfer coefficient , @xmath5 , is no longer a parameter that is taken into consideration .",

    "both the butler - volmer and marcus - hush programs were modified to account for a homogeneous chemical step in the mass transport equations , as detailed in the theory section .    for the purposes of determining a starting point for @xmath134 and concentration ,",

    "optimised values for @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath136 were obtained to give the `` best fit '' using the modified butler - volmer program described above , which was quantified with the calculation of a mean scaled absolute deviation ( msad , as described in the section [ msad ] ) .",

    "the value for the transfer coefficient , @xmath5 , of 0.31 , suggests an early , reactant - like transition state .",
    "this is congruent with the result found in section [ o2 in bmpyrr ] , and a similar @xmath3 of @xmath141 cm s@xmath26 is reported , which is again in agreement with the literature values reported in table [ lit values ] .",
    "smh theory was used independently to generate the same set of parameters as generated in the bv theory with the transfer coefficient , @xmath5 , once again being replaced by a representation for reorganisation energy , @xmath8 .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath8 was determined to be 0.5 @xmath139 0.1 ev in this solvent .",
    "once again , the bv program provides parameters with a significantly greater level of certainty that the smh program . and ,",
    "although the smh theory gives greater physical insight compared with the phenomenological bv theory , this greater uncertainty leaves bv as the preferred theory , in terms of attaining more reliable parameterisation .      both systems under study , oxygen reduction in either a pyrrolidinium or phosphonium based il , display similarly low diffusion coefficients ( @xmath134 = 2.05 and 3.95 @xmath142 m@xmath127 s@xmath26 respectively ) and solubilities of oxygen ( @xmath133 = 10 and 7.3 mm ) .",
    "in addition to this , both the transfer coefficients ( @xmath5 = 0.29 @xmath139 0.01 , and 0.31 @xmath139 0.01 respectively ) and the reorganisation energies ( @xmath8 = 0.4 @xmath139 0.1 , and 0.5 @xmath139 0.1 respectively ) are similar . as outlined in the introduction , @xmath8 encompasses contributions from both inner - sphere reorganisation of the molecule itself , and outer - sphere solvent reorganisation about the electroactive species . the inner - sphere reorganisation is due to the change in bond length on going from o@xmath124 to o@xmath143 ( 0.12 )@xcite , with outer - sphere solvent reorganisation dominating in aqueous systems .",
    "literature reports suggest the overall reorganisation energy for the oxygen self - exchange reaction in water is 1.26 - 4.51 ev.@xcite the inner - sphere contribution was estimated to be 0.4 - 0.6 ev.@xcite given the close agreement with previously reported values for inner sphere reorganisation@xcite , the experimental values for @xmath8 in both of the systems considered in this work are consistent with a process dominated by an inner sphere contribution .",
    "previous reports have indicated that oxygen itself had weak interactions with an ionic liquid,@xcite and the result reported in the present work suggests that the ionic liquid does not undergo any significant reorganisation on moving from oxygen to superoxide .",
    "this may be related to the very small size of the o@xmath124/o@xmath143 species compared to the component ions of the rtil .",
    "the reported best fit values for the rate constant given by smh theory are similar to those established by bv theory , however there is less agreement with the experimental data than is seen when the bv program is used .",
    "this is reflected both in the larger mean msad values , and qualitatively observing the fit as seen in figs .",
    "[ bmpyrrntf2 ] and [ p14666ntf2 ] .",
    "further studies may involve consideration of asymmetric mh theory , which relaxes the requirement that the potential energy parabola are of equal curvature , and introduces a new parameter to describe the disparity in curvature between the reactant and product .",
    "this has been considered in a number of molecular systems,@xcite and has been determined to fit experimental data more accurately than smh .",
    "models were developed to simulate cyclic voltammetry at a microdisc electrode and a sphere on a surface electrode using both butler - volmer and symmetric marcus - hush kinetics .",
    "the microdisc model was used to investigate the possibility of kinetically limited steady state currents at a microdisc electrode , and it was found that this phenomenon is more likely to be observed at nano - sized sphere on a surface electrodes ( _ e.g. _ an impacting nanoparticle ) because of the smaller size .",
    "it was also found that the steady state equivalence ( subject to a mass transport correction ) between microdisc electrodes and spherical electrodes resting on a surface also hold when marcus - hush kinetics are employed .",
    "the reduction of oxygen at a microdisc electrode in two room temperature ionic liquids , [ bmpyrr][ntf@xmath0 and [ p@xmath1[ntf@xmath0 , has been studied with cyclic voltammetry at 298 k. bv theory and smh theory were used to create simulation programs , and the simulated voltammograms were compared with experimental data .",
    "bv theory , although empirical , provided voltammograms with lower msad values than those generated using smh theory .",
    "a reorganisation energy , from the smh program , was determined to be 0.4 - 0.5 ev for oxygen reduction in the two rtils studied .",
    "this low value likely corresponds to a dominant inner sphere reorganisation , and limited solvent reorganisation .",

    "<S> the voltammetry for the reduction of oxygen at a microdisc electrode is reported in two room temperature ionic liquids : 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium _ bis_(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide + ( [ bmpyrr][ntf@xmath0 ) and trihexyltetradecylphosphonium _ </S>",
    "<S> bis_(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide + ( [ p@xmath1[ntf@xmath0 ) at 298 k. simulated voltammograms using butler - volmer theory and symmetric marcus - hush ( smh ) theory were compared with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> butler - volmer theory consistently provided experimental parameters with a higher level of certainty than smh theory . </S>",
    "<S> a value of solvent reorganisation energy for oxygen reduction in ionic liquids was inferred for the first time as 0.4 - 0.5 ev , which is attributable to inner - sphere reorganisation with a negligible contribution from solvent reorganisation . </S>",
    "<S> the developed butler - volmer and symmetric marcus - hush programs are also used to theoretically study the possibility of kinetically limited steady state currents , and to establish an approximate equivalence relationship between microdisc electrodes and spherical electrodes resting on a surface for steady state voltammetry for both butler - volmer and symmetric marcus - hush theory . </S>"
