    "binary systems of compact objects will be ubiquitous sources for the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite .",
    "observations have shown that today there are massive black holes in the center of nearly all galaxies  @xcite .",
    "when galaxies collide their central black holes sink to the center of the merged galaxy and begin to orbit one another , losing energy and angular momentum in the form of gravitational waves  @xcite . gravitational wave ( gw )",
    "emission rapidly erases any initial eccentricity  @xcite , so it has long been thought that eccentricity could be ignored when modeling the signals from massive black hole binaries  @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , it has been shown that the mechanisms that may harden the binary to the point where the gravitational wave emission takes over all tend to drive up the eccentricity  @xcite .",
    "the question then is whether significant eccentricity survives until the final year or so before merger .",
    "figure  [ fig : etrack ] shows the eccentricity evolution as a function of orbital frequency for systems that enter the gravitational wave dominated evolution stage at frequency @xmath0 with eccentricities of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the tracks are computed using the leading - order peters and matthews  @xcite evolution equations .",
    "these equations predict that once the eccentricity drops below @xmath3 , it decays as @xmath4 - in other words , roughly a factor of ten in eccentricity is lost per decade of frequency .",
    "the rate of decay is slower for systems with very high eccentricities , allowing them to maintain significant eccentricity for longer . for typical lisa",
    "black hole binaries , the gw decay time drops below the hubble time when the systems are 3 to 5 decades in frequency from the lisa band , so unless @xmath5 is very close to unity , a purely gw driven orbital evolution results in nearly circular orbits in the lisa band .",
    "on the other hand , if the hardening mechanism ( _ e.g. _ gas dynamics or stellar scattering ) continues to dominate the dynamics until the system is close to the lisa band , then interesting eccentricities can be maintained .        in a recent study  @xcite",
    ", sesana has shown that stellar scattering produces lisa sources with eccentricities in the range @xmath6 . moreover , as shown in figure 8 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the distribution of eccentricities depends on the component masses in a particular way , so measuring this distribution can help constrain black hole merger models . while the distribution of component masses and spins as a function of luminosity distance will likely play a more important role in studying galaxy - black hole co - evolution  @xcite , the eccentricity distribution may provide useful additional constraints .",
    "these considerations suggest that it is desirable to include the effects of eccentricity in the gravitational waveform , bringing the total number of parameters needed to describe a black hole inspiral to seventeen : the redshifted black hole masses @xmath7 , the distance to the source @xmath8 , the initial radial eccentricity and semi - major axis @xmath9 , the dimensionless spin parameters for the two black holes @xmath10 , the source sky location @xmath11 , the initial orientation of the angular momentum and spin vectors @xmath12 , and two initial phase parameters @xmath13 .",
    "failing to include the eccentricity in the waveform model will lead to a loss of signal - to - noise  @xcite and to biases in the recovery of the other parameters  @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous gravitational waveforms describing the inspiral of a black hole binary with arbitrary spins , masses , and orbital eccentricity were calculated by kidder  @xcite to second post - newtonian order ( 2pn , or order @xmath14 in the relative velocity ) , and extended to 2.5pn order by faye , blanchet and buonanno  @xcite .",
    "majr and vasth  @xcite later introduced a convenient framework for expressing the waveforms in a form amenable to producing detection templates . together with a solution to the conservative equations of motion , adiabatically advanced with the angular momentum and energy dissipation equations  @xcite",
    ", we can build the time dependent gravitational waveforms for a general binary black hole system with the full seventeen parameters necessary to describe the system .",
    "lisa observations of binary black hole inspirals can be compared to these waveforms to produce posterior distributions for the model parameters .",
    "these observations will allow us to constrain galaxy merger scenarios  @xcite , and allow us to test general relativity in the dynamical strong field regime  @xcite .",
    "left unaccounted for , the effects of orbital eccentricity may be mistaken for a departure from general relativity ( in particular , even small eccentricities that produce negligible power in higher harmonics can lead to easily detectable changes in the phase evolution of the signal ) .    black hole binary systems in eccentric orbits may also be detected by ground based gravitational wave detectors such as the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) and virgo  @xcite .",
    "some models even predict that inspiral signals may enter the ligo band with @xmath15 and that eccentric templates will be necessary to detect such sources  @xcite .",
    "current ligo data analysis uses circular templates and may need to be generalized to include eccentricity .",
    "we have previously described a method for combining the instantaneous gravitational waveforms for eccentric binary systems with a post - keplerian solution to the equations of motion that is adiabatically advanced using the the orbit - averaged dissipation and spin precession equations to build ready - to - use gravitational waveforms for the general case of a spinning black hole binary system in an eccentric orbit  @xcite . here",
    "we present the results of a parameter estimation study for spinning eccentric binary black hole sources for the lisa mission .",
    "this is an extension of the lang and hughes lisa parameter estimation study of spinning binary black holes in circular orbits  @xcite and is the first to include the full seventeen parameters that describe a general black hole binary inspiral .",
    "the equations needed to numerically calculate time dependent gravitational waveforms for binary black hole systems have been computed to 2.5pn order in the amplitude and phase  @xcite .",
    "the resulting system of equations could be numerically evolved to produce waveforms for our study , but the computational cost of resolving the motion of the black holes on the orbital timescale is too large for the parameter estimation study we wish to perform . taking advantage of the separation of time",
    "scales in the waveform model we have developed an efficient waveform generator at 1.5 pn order in the amplitude and phase  @xcite .",
    "these waveforms include the effects of periastron precession , the precession of the orbital plane due to spin - orbit coupling , and higher harmonics from the higher order mass and current multipole moments .",
    "our waveform model does not include the effects of spin - spin coupling which enter at 2pn order . in future work",
    "we plan to extend the waveform model and our parameter estimation study to higher post - newtonian order .",
    "the fastest time scale for the system is the orbital time scale , which to leading order is given by kepler s law : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total mass of the system and @xmath18 is the semi - major axis .",
    "periastron advance enters at 1pn order , with a fractional advance per orbit of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath21 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath22 is the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "the ratio of the periastron precession timescale to the orbital timescale is given by @xmath23    the orbital angular momentum @xmath24 precesses with angular velocity @xmath25  @xcite , where @xmath26 the effective spin vector has magnitude @xmath27 since the magnitude of the individual spins is given by @xmath28 where the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the ratio of the precession time scale and the orbital timescale is given by @xmath30 we see that the precession of the orbital plane enters at 1.5pn order relative to the orbital time scale .",
    "the precession of the orbital angular momentum due to spin - orbit coupling results in a modulation of the amplitude of the gravitational waveform at the solar system barycenter .     at the solar system barycenter for a binary black hole system with @xmath31 ( source 1 in table  [ tab : sourcep ] ) during the final year before merger.,width=288 ]    the rate at which the binary black hole system loses energy and angular momentum due to gravitational wave emission defines the decay time scale @xmath32 and the ratio @xmath33 the loss of energy and angular momentum results in the decay of the semi - major axis and the radial eccentricity of the system .",
    "orbit averaged expression for these decay rates can be found in ref .",
    "the effects of spin - orbit induced precession of the orbital plane and the overall sweep up in frequency and amplitude as the system inspirals over the course of a year are apparent in figure  [ fig : hyear ] for a system with @xmath31 and other source parameters given in table  [ tab : sourcep ] for source 1 .    at times",
    "well before the merger of the system @xmath34 is small and we find that @xmath35 we take advantage of this separation of the relevant time scales to make our waveform calculations more efficient",
    ". since the decay and precession timescales are much longer than the orbital timescale we can start with a solution to the orbital equations of motion that neglects dissipation .",
    "this allows us to use nyquist sampling of just a couple of samples per orbit for the quantities that depend on the dissipation and precession equations and saves considerable computational cost .",
    "considering only times early in the evolution of the system we have a clean separation of time scales and the different processes can be treated differently in the calculations .",
    "this simplifies the problem by allowing an adiabatic treatment where the dissipation is assumed to be small over the course of an orbit and the eccentricity and semi - major axis are treated as constant while calculating an individual orbit .",
    "the approximations involved in exploiting the separation of timescales introduce small errors in the waveforms .",
    "the largest of these comes from using the orbit - averaged spin precession equations , which neglects small periodic changes in the spin orientations that occur on the orbital timescale , but these changes are effectively 2.5 pn order contributions to the higher harmonics .",
    "the averaging also introduces small errors in the long term secular evolution that scale as the ratio of the averaging time scale ( in our case the orbital timescale ) and the timescale of the terms being averaged ( such as the spin precession timescale ) .",
    "these errors are multiplicative , and so represent higher pn order terms that can be discarded at 1.5 pn order .",
    "as the system approaches merger the various time scales become comparable and our waveform model breaks down .",
    "we adopt the termination condition @xmath36 , which corresponds to an expansion parameter @xmath37 . denoting the time when this condition is met as @xmath38 , and the orbital frequency at this time as @xmath39",
    ", we taper the waveform smoothly to zero by multiplying the waveform with a half - hann filter : @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "our termination condition is conservative in terms of the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) lisa will be able to extract from this type of source .",
    "most of the snr comes from times near merger , so the extension of the validity of the waveform closer to merger results in a big increase in snr .",
    "our study here is thus a pessimistic estimate of how well lisa will be able to determine the various source parameters . in the case of the radial eccentricity parameter",
    "however , the circularization of the waveform toward merger means that most of the eccentricity information is encoded at times well before merger . while increased snr would improve the determination of the other source parameters , we find that the eccentricity is not highly correlated with the other parameters ( see figure  [ fig : ecchist ] ) .",
    "our choice for when to truncate the waveform thus should not have much of an effect on our study of how well lisa will be able to determine the eccentricity of black hole binary systems .",
    "we have tested our waveform generator in various limits against other codes . in the circular limit , and with dissipation turned off , we found precise agreement with the 1.5 pn limit of the spinning black hole code developed by cornish , hughes , lang and nissanke that is described in ref .",
    "we do not expect , and nor do we find , precise agreement when dissipation is included .",
    "this is because our eccentric waveform generator evolves the semi - major axis , while the circular orbit code evolves the orbital frequency , which leads to numerical differences at 2 pn order . in the 0-pn limit (",
    "hence no spin effects and no higher harmonics ) we find precise agreement with the peters and matthews waveforms  @xcite .",
    "we simulate the lisa response to a gravitational wave signal plus instrument noise and confusion noise due to galactic binary sources of gravitational waves .",
    "we adopt the standard ecliptic coordinate system with origin at the barycenter .",
    "the individual data streams from the six lisa phase meters can be combined to cancel out the laser phase noise and form time delay interferometry ( tdi ) variables  @xcite .",
    "the michelson style tdi variables @xmath42 can be used to construct three noise orthogonal data streams that are similar to the @xmath43 variables described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "processing the gravitational waveform through the lisa response function imparts additional amplitude and frequency modulations on the one year timescale of the lisa orbits .",
    "these effects can be seen in figure  [ fig : achannel ] , which shows the @xmath44-channel response to the barycenter signal shown previously in figure  [ fig : hyear ] .",
    "channel response to the spinning binary black hole system shown in figure  [ fig : hyear ] .",
    "the amplitude modulation is due to a combination of the antenna pattern sweeping around as lisa orbits the sun , and the spin induced precession of the orbital plane .",
    "the overall gravitational wave amplitude grows as the system spirals in and nears merger.,width=288 ]    the one - sided noise spectral density of the detector in the a and e channels is given by  @xcite : @xmath45 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the position noise and @xmath48 is acceleration noise , and",
    "we have taken the limit of symmetric noise in the detector . the confusion noise due to gravitational wave sources in the galaxy has been estimated by direct simulation of the lisa response  @xcite to a synthetic galaxy  @xcite , followed by the removal of resolvable systems  @xcite .",
    "an approximate fit to the resulting confusion noise estimate is given by @xmath49 the total noise is then taken to be the sum of the the two contributions : @xmath50 .",
    "the goal of a parameter estimation study is to find how accurately we can determine the values of the source parameters for a given signal . we take a bayesian approach and use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique to compute the posterior distribution function @xmath51 describing the model parameters @xmath52 that we infer from data @xmath53 .",
    "our results establish how well the various source parameters will be able to be determined by the lisa mission , including the orbital eccentricity .",
    "the use of mcmc techniques in gravitational wave data analysis is now a familiar technique for parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy  @xcite .",
    "the result of a well constructed mcmc is a set of samples from the posterior distribution .",
    "the number of samples from a particular region of parameter space is proportional to the posterior weight contained in that region .",
    "the uncertainty in each parameter is given by quantiles of the marginalized posterior distribution ( e.g. the half - width of the @xmath54 percentile equates to a 2-@xmath55 error if the distributions are gaussian ) .    by bayes theorem ,",
    "the posterior distribution is given by the product of the prior distribution @xmath56 and likelihood @xmath57 , normalized by the evidence @xmath58 .",
    "for gaussian noise , the likelihood of the data @xmath53 having being generated by a gravitational wave signal @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a normalization constant that does not depend on the signal or the template .",
    "here we have used the noise weighted inner product @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the one - sided noise spectral density .",
    "the prior probability density for @xmath64 reflects our knowledge of the source parameter , however ill - formed , before we analyze the data .",
    "for example , we assume a uniform prior for angular parameters such as the sky location and the initial orientation of the angular momentum vector , such that the cosine of the co - latitude is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath65 $ ] and the azimuth is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath66 $ ]",
    ".    the primary mode of the posterior distribution yields the best fit values for the source parameters , according to the current data and our prior knowledge . in many instances",
    "the posterior distribution is multi - modal , and the quantiles used to estimate the parameter uncertainties may cover disjoint regions in parameter space .",
    "even when the bulk of the posterior weight lies in a single , contiguous region , the posterior distribution may not be well approximated by a gaussian distribution .",
    "nonetheless , a gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution often provides a reasonable estimate of the parameter estimation errors , which can be efficiently computed using the fisher information matrix @xmath67 , which measures the expectation value of the curvature of the posterior distribution about the mode : @xmath68 we employ a parallel tempered  @xcite metropolis - hastings  @xcite mcmc routine to explore the pdf .",
    "the markov chain starts at parameter values @xmath64 and transitions to @xmath69 with probability @xmath70\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath71 is the proposal distribution , which is the function that generates proposals for moves from @xmath64 to @xmath69 .",
    "the performance of an mcmc algorithm is quite sensitive to the choice of proposal distribution , and care must be taken to ensure that the chains do not get stuck on local maxima of the pdf .",
    "we employed several techniques to ensure rapid exploration of the full parameter space : local coordinate transformations to uncouple the parameters ; moves that exploit symmetries of the likelihood surface to encourage jumps between local maxima ; and parallel tempering to encourage wide exploration of the posterior  @xcite .",
    "the number of iterations spent at each parameter value is proportional to the posterior density , and histograms of the parameters visited by the chain provide an estimate of the posterior distribution .",
    "we have found that drawing from a variety of proposal distributions provides a set of jump proposals that tend to produce an mcmc that efficiently maps out the desired pdf and provides accurate parameter uncertainties even for very large search spaces .",
    "our parameter estimation study thus uses several proposal distributions , including parallel tempering and fisher matrix proposals . in this high dimensional parameter space",
    "we found it advantageous to use the fisher matrix approximation to the posterior to propose jumps along single eigen - directions as part of the mixture of jump proposals .",
    "we can use our time dependent gravitational waveforms  @xcite and established mcmc techniques to study how well lisa will be able to measure the full set of seventeen parameters necessary to describe a spinning binary black hole system in an eccentric orbit .",
    "we are especially interested in determining when eccentric orbits can be distinguished from circular orbits .",
    "we chose to study signals in their final year prior to merger , with an observation time that extends just beyond the merger . in order to choose initial parameter values for a system that will merge in one year",
    ", we need to calculate an initial semi - major axis based on the lifetime estimate for a system with some given initial radial eccentricity .",
    "we use the leading order , 0pn expression for @xmath72  @xcite @xmath73 as an initial guess , and apply a bisection routine to the full numerical orbital evolution to find the value of @xmath72 that yields a merger time @xmath74 of one year .",

    "these parameters are degenerate , but for eccentric orbits we have to specify the initial periastron position . in the present study we have ignored the possibility that gas dynamics may partially aligned the spins with the orbital angular momentum  @xcite , which would restrict the prior ranges and reduce the degree of orbital precession .",
    "the impact of this partial alignment on parameter estimation has been considered for circular orbits  @xcite , and it would be interesting to extend this study to include eccentricity .    here",
    "we study several representative cases to establish the parameter recovery errors and to study correlations between the parameters .",
    "the high dimension of the parameter space makes it difficult to perform a comprehensive study - if we were to choose just two values of each parameter we would need to perform @xmath98 parameter estimation studies .",
    "each mcmc run involves @xmath99 iterations with @xmath100 parallel chains , and takes about a week to run on a single 2.66 ghz intel processor , so we are limited in the number of examples we can consider .",
    "we perform mcmc parameter estimation studies of several representative examples , varying the mass ratio , sky location , distance , eccentricity , and dimensionless spin parameters .",
    "we only looked at a few initial spin and orbital orientations since we do not expect these to have a significant effect on the results - unless the initial orientations are very special the system will explore a wide range of orientations during the orbital evolution . to be able to explore the parameter space more widely would take a faster code .",
    "one possibility is to use the fisher information matrix approximation to the posterior , which is many orders of magnitude faster than a full mcmc study . in preparation for such a study",
