    "studying the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) of various physical problems is vital and has diverse applications in many disciplinary fields such as science and engineering . in most cases ,",
    "the mfpt is usually defined as the amount of time that a given particle takes to surmount a certain threshold where the threshold can be specified as a certain boundary , potential barrier and specified state .",
    "particularly if one considers a brownian particle moving in a viscous medium , assisted by the thermal background kicks , the particle presumably crosses the potential barrier .",
    "the magnitude of its mfpt relies not only on the system parameters , such as the potential barrier height , but also it depends on the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "understanding of such noise induced thermally activated barrier crossing problem is vital to get a better understanding of most biological problems @xcite . in the past , considering temperature independent viscous friction , the dependence of the mean first passage time ( equivalently the escape rate ) on model parameters has been explored for various model systems , see for example the work @xcite .",
    "however experiment shows that the viscous friction @xmath0 is indeed temperature dependent and it decreases as temperature increases . in this work",
    "we discuss the role of temperature on the viscous friction as well as on the mfpt by taking a viscous friction @xmath0 that decreases exponentially when the temperature @xmath1 of the medium increases ( @xmath2 ) as proposed originally by reynolds @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the mfpt is smaller in magnitude when @xmath0 is temperature dependent than when it is temperature independent .",
    "this is plausible since the diffusion constant @xmath6 is valid when the viscous friction considered to be temperature dependent showing that the effect of temperature on the particle mobility is twofold .",
    "first , it directly assists the particle to surmount the potential barrier .",
    "in other words , the particle jumps the potential barrier at the expenses of the thermal kicks .",
    "second , when temperature increases , the viscous friction gets attenuated and as a result the diffusibility of the particle increases .",
    "the first passage time problem has also been extensively studied in many excitable systems such as chemical reaction , neural system and cardiac system @xcite . particularly in cardiac system ,",
    "the intra - cellular calcium dynamics is responsible for a number of trigged arrhythmias @xcite . as discussed in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the abnormal calcium release at a single microdomain level can be studied via master equation , where the corresponding fokker - planck equation can be written with an effective bistable potential .",
    "the mfpt for a single brownian particle to cross the effective potential then corresponds to the time it takes for @xmath7 channels to open at a single microdomain level .",
    "thus , although in the present paper we consider a simplified ratchet potential , our study gives us a clue regarding the dynamics of calcium ions in the cardiac system .",
    "moreover membrane depolarization occurs if the simulations happen on tissue level when @xmath5 microdomains interact .",
    "the first passage time for one of these @xmath5 microdomains to fire for the first time can be found by calculating the mfpt that one particle takes out of @xmath5 particle to cross the potential barrier .",
    "exposing excitable systems to time varying periodic forces may result in an intriguing dynamics where in this case the coordination of the noise with time varying force leads to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite provided that the noise induced hopping events synchronize with the signal .",
    "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance has obtained considerable interests because of its signicant practical applications in a wide range of fields .",
    "sr depicts that systems enhance their performance as long as the thermal background noise is synchronized with time varying periodic signal . since the innovative work of benzi _ et",
    "@xcite , the idea of stochastic resonance has been broadened and implemented to many model systems @xcite .",
    "recently the occurrence of stochastic resonance for a brownian particle as well as for extended system such as polymer has been reported by us @xcite .",
    "our analysis revealed that , due to the exibility that can enhance crossing rate and change in chain conformations at the barrier , the power amplication exhibits an optimal value at optimal chain lengths and elastic constants as well as at optimal noise strengths .",
    "however most of these studies considered a viscous friction which is temperature independent . in this work ,",
    "considering temperature dependent viscous friction , we study how the power amplication behaves as one varies the model parameters .",
    "we first explore the stochastic resonance of a single particle and we then study the sr for many particle system by considering both temperature dependent and independent viscous friction cases .    the aim of this paper is to explore the crossing rate and stochastic resonance of a single as well as many brownian particles in a piecewise linear bistable potential by considering both temperature dependent and independent viscous friction cases .",
    "although a generic model system is considered , the present study helps to understand the dynamics of excitable systems and it is also vital for basic understanding of statistical physics .",
    "the mfpt at single particle level is extensively studied in the past see for example the work @xcite .",
    "however , the role of temperature on viscosity as well as on mfpt has not been studied in detail and this will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "particularly , in the presence of time varying signal , we study how the background temperature affects the viscosity as well as the signal to noise ratio @xmath3 and spectral density@xmath8 . on the other hand , the first passage time statistics at ensemble ( @xmath5 particles )",
    "level has been explored in many studies @xcite . however , to best of our knowledge , the role of time - varying signal as well as the role of temperature on @xmath3 and @xmath4 has not been studied in detail at the ensemble level . in this work , via numerical simulations and using the exact analytic results , we study stochastic resonance of @xmath5 particles .    to give you a brief outline , in this work first we study the mfpt of a single particle both for temperature dependent and independent viscous friction cases .",
    "the exact analytic results as well as the simulation results depict that the mfpt is considerably smaller when @xmath0 is temperature dependent . in both cases the escape rate increases as the noise strength increases and decreases as the potential barrier increases .",
    "we then extend our study for @xmath5 particle systems .",
    "the first passage time for one of the @xmath5 particles to fire for the first time @xmath9 can be found both analytically ( at least in the high barrier limit ) and via numerical simulation for a bistable system . it is found that @xmath10 is considerably smaller when the viscous friction is temperature dependent . for both cases ,",
    "@xmath10 decreases as the noise strength increases and as the potential barrier steps down . in high barrier limit , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mfpt for a single particle . in general as the number of particles @xmath5 increases , @xmath10 decreases .",
    "we then study our model system in the presence of time varying signal . in this case",
    "the interplay between noise and sinusoidal driving force in the bistable system may lead the system into stochastic resonance . analytically and via numerical simulations ,",
    "we study how the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) and power amplication ( @xmath4 ) behave as a function of the model parameters .",
    "@xmath4 as well as snr depicts a pronounced peak at particular noise strength @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath4 is higher for temperature dependent @xmath0 case . in the presence of many particles",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath4 is considerably amplified as @xmath5 steps up , showing that the weak periodic signal plays a vital role in controlling the noise induced dynamics of excitable systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model . in section iii , by considering both temperature dependent and independent viscous friction cases , we explore the dependence for mfpt on model parameters for a single as well as many particle systems .",
    "the role of sinusoidal driving force on enhancing the mobility of the particle is studied in iv .",
    "section v deals with summary and conclusion .",
    "let us consider a brownian particle that walks in a piecewise linear potential with an external load @xmath13 , where the ratchet potential @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the barrier height and the width of the ratchet potential , respectively .",
    "the potential exhibits its maximum value @xmath15 at @xmath17 and its minima at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the ratchet potential is coupled with a uniform temperature @xmath1 as shown in fig . 1 .        for a brownian particle that is arranged to undergo a random walk in a highly viscous medium , the dynamics of the particle",
    "is governed by langevin equation @xcite .",
    "the general stochastic langevin equation , which is derived in the pioneering work of petter hnggi @xcite , can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the viscous friction , and @xmath22 is the boltzmann s constant @xcite .",

    "various experimental studies also showed that the viscosity of the medium tends to decrease as the temperature of the medium increases .",
    "this is because increasing the temperature steps up the speed of the molecules , and this in turn creates a reduction in the interaction time between neighboring molecules . as a result",

    "it is important to note that most of the previous studies of thermally activated barrier crossing rate considered only temperature invariance viscous friction case . in reality",
    ", it is well know that the mean first passage time of a brownian particle tends to depend on the intensity of the background temperature .",
    "however in liquid or glassy medium , the viscosity tends to decrease when the intensity of the background temperature increases .",
    "this is because an increase in temperature of the medium brings more agitation to the molecules in the medium , and hence increases their speed .",
    "this speedy motion of the molecules creates a reduction in interaction time between neighboring molecules . in turn , at macroscopic level , there will be a reduction in the intermolecular force .",
    "consequently , as the temperature of the viscous medium decreases , the viscous friction in the medium decreases which implies that the mobility of the particle considerably increases ( mfpt decreases ) when the temperature of the medium increases .",
