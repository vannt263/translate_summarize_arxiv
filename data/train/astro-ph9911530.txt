    "world wide theoretical and experimental efforts to understand what we could learn from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are presently in progress .",
    "anisotropies in the cmb should contain precious details about high energy physics processes occurred in the early universe , still hidden to our knowledge . reasonably , these processes left traces that have been stretched out to large and observable scales by an early era of accelerate expansion , called inflation ; at decoupling between matter and radiation , these traces imprinted anisotropies in the cmb , thus being possibly detected and recognized .",
    "recently , the treatment of the linear cmb inhomogeneities has been put in a complete and organic form @xcite . at the same time , many experiments are at work to explore the cmb anisotropies toward smaller and smaller angular scales @xcite ; they shall culminate with the planck mission of the next decade , that will provide the whole sky anisotropy map down to a minimum @xmath9 and an angular resolution of about @xmath10 @xcite .    according to the simplest inflationary phenomenology , at very high energy in the early universe ( @xmath11 planck masses ) , a scalar field slowly rolls toward the minimum of its potential , giving the non - zero vacuum energy responsible for the expansion itself .",
    "the quantum fluctuations generated during this phase are stretched out by the inflationary expansion itself to large scales and become the perturbations we observe today in the matter power spectrum @xcite . however ,",
    "this is not the only known inflationary mechanism .",
    "many fundamental fields may act on stage and the effective potential may have several minima separated by potential barriers .",
    "if this is the case quantum tunneling occurs , and the nucleated bubbles are stretched out to large scales just like the ordinary quantum fluctuations . at reheating the energy stored in the bubble shell is converted into matter and radiation and a bubbly trace is left in the density distribution .",
    "tunneling processes are predicted in the context of first order inflation @xcite ; the possibility that bubbles have left traces in the large scale matter distribution was considered in the last decade @xcite , in connection with the increasing observational evidence of large voids in the galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to accurately predict the cmb polarization and temperature anisotropies from bubbly density perturbations existing at decoupling , relics of the inflationary tunneling phenomena . in an early work @xcite we considered anisotropies from non - linear bubbles mainly for what concerns metric induced perturbations .",
    "then , more recently @xcite we used an approximated method to compute the temperature anisotropies @xmath3 from isolated inflationary bubbles in linear regime ; we found that , just like a pebble in a pond , the bubbly perturbation generates anisotropy waves , traveling outward with the cmb sound velocity and reaching the scale of the sound horizon at the time we are examining it . therefore , the image of an inflationary bubble at decoupling is a series of concentric isothermal rings of different color ( sign of @xmath3 ) on the scale of the sound horizon at decoupling ( @xmath0 in the sky ) . in a separate work",
    "@xcite we explored the impact of a distribution of bubbles on the cmb temperature angular power spectrum , finding for a wide set of statistical parameters extra power on sub - degree angular scales .    here",
    "we compute the cmb polarization anisotropies induced by inflationary bubbles , and we generalize previous results on the temperature in the context of the full linear theory of cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "we model the remnant of an inflationary bubble as a linear bubbly perturbation in the density distribution at the beginning of the radiation dominated era . each fourier mode is analytically calculated and numerically evolved following the linearized einstein and boltzmann equations .",
    "we use these results to study the signal from a single bubble . regarding the size and density contrast of the bubbles ,",
    "they are ultimately determined by the epoch of nucleation during inflation and by the properties of the tunneling barrier , so that these parameters depend on the details of the inflationary potential @xcite ; as in previous works @xcite here we choose the bubble properties corresponding to the large voids observed in the galaxy distribution @xcite , that have deep cavities @xmath12 and comoving radii of about @xmath13 mpc ; if they are of primordial origin , the evolution from decoupling to the present implies an overcomoving growth by a factor of 2 , and the density contrast increases approximatively linearly with the scale factor @xcite : thus , the voids corresponding to the present ones should have at decoupling a comoving radius @xmath14 mpc and density contrast @xmath15 , values that we adopt in this work .",
    "starting from the signal from isolated bubbles , we predict the effect of a distribution of bubbles on the cmb temperature and polarization power spectra ; as expected in scenarios admitting a bubble nucleating era during the inflationary slow roll @xcite , we consider models containing a population of bubbles together with ordinary cdm gaussian perturbations ; in this context we simulate cmb sky maps and we compute the anisotropy angular power spectrum for various bubbly distribution parameters . as a general useful comment here ,",
    "we wish to emphasize that both in the cases of a single bubble and a distribution of them , the signals treated here are definitely different from gaussian perturbations .",
    "gaussianity means that the fluctuations exhibit a completely disordered spatial distribution ; only in this case the cmb angular power spectra tell us everything about the signal . on the contrary",
    "a bubbly perturbation is an ordered structure : it really possesses a spherical symmetry . technically speaking ,",
    "its signal is non - gaussian ; therefore , even if the cmb power spectrum is a powerful tool to investigate also non - gaussian models , it does not fix completely the underlying fluctuations , and other methods should be adopted to investigate which type of non - gaussian ordered pattern is present on the observed map .",
    "the general treatment of cmb anisotropies from cosmological structures having spatial finite extension and symmetries has been recently treated in detail @xcite ; we apply the general treatment developed in that work to the present case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we recall the relevant equations for our purposes and we expose the computational details ; in section iii we evolve the bubbly perturbation to study the corresponding cmb perturbation at different times and to predict the effect on the cmb polarization and temperature anisotropies from isolated bubbles ; in section iv we consider several distributions of bubbles and we predict their imprint on the cmb angular power spectra , also giving simple scalings in terms of the distribution parameters ; finally , section v contains the conclusions .",
    "the evolution equations for fluid and cmb quantities may be obtained by the boltzmann and linearized einstein equations @xcite . a standard cdm flat background is assumed , including cold dark matter ( @xmath16 ) , baryons ( @xmath17 ) , photons ( @xmath18 ) and three families of massless neutrinos ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the background flat friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) metric is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the conformal time .",
    "the background evolution is driven by the einstein equation @xmath22 where the index @xmath23 runs over all the fluid species ; the background parameters are @xmath24 .",
    "the perturbed metric tensor is @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the background .",
    "since @xmath27 , a gauge freedom reduces the number of physically significant quantities in the perturbation metric tensor ; in this work we adopt the generalized newtonian gauge in which the two scalar perturbed metric component are @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite ; concerning the fluid , @xmath30 indicates the density contrast @xmath31 for the species @xmath23 and @xmath32 its peculiar velocity in the background metric .",
    "unless otherwise specified , all the equations for the perturbed quantities in the remaining part of this section are written in fourier space , and the wavenumber argument is omitted .",
    "the equations for the matter species are : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the differential optical depth ; @xmath36 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath37 is the electron number density and @xmath38 the ionization fraction @xcite .",
    "now we give the expressions for the cmb temperature and polarization perturbations in the context of a spherical perturbation field ; these formulas have been recently developed @xcite .",
    "as customary , we indicate the temperature perturbation @xmath3 with @xmath39 and the linear polarization amplitude with the stokes parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "temperature perturbation carried by cmb photons scattered on an arbitrary direction @xmath42 at a spacetime position @xmath43 around a spherical structure is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively legendre polynomials and fractional order bessel functions .",
    "all the specifications regarding the perturbation source are encoded in the @xmath47 coefficients , which obey evolution equations that we shall write in a moment . concerning the polarization",
    ", we have to specify the frame axes describing the polarization tensor on the plane perpendicular to @xmath42 .",
    "we choose them parallel and perpendicular to the plane formed by @xmath42 and @xmath48 ; with this choice , the polarization tensor is described only by @xmath40 @xcite in the following way : @xmath49 @xmath50 are second order legendre polynomials ; this is a significant difference from ( [ thetasphere ] ) : correctly , they make photons moving radially not polarized ( @xmath51 ) . again all the characteristics of the perturbation source are contained in the @xmath52 quantities .",
    "now we give the evolution equations for the @xmath52 and @xmath47 coefficients .",
    "they are the amplitudes of polarization and temperature cmb perturbations expanded in scalar and tensor spherical harmonics @xcite , and obey the following equations : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 and for @xmath57 @xmath58- \\dot{\\tau}\\theta_{l}\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath59- \\dot{\\tau}e_{l}\\ .",
    "\\label{elboltzmann}\\ ] ] in newtonian gauge the lowest multipoles are linked to the photon fluid quantities by @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "massless neutrinos can be treated as photons without the polarization and thomson scattering terms .",
    "there remain the equations for the gravitational potentials : @xmath63 @xmath64 as it is known @xcite , at early times the above system can be solved by using the tight coupling approximation between photons and baryons .",
    "the multipole equations are expanded in powers of @xmath65 .",
    "the only zero order terms are @xmath66 and @xmath67 from ( [ b],[theta0],[theta1 ] ) , and obey the following equations : @xmath68 @xmath69= k\\theta_{0}+k\\left(1+{3\\rho_{b}\\over 4\\rho_{\\gamma}}\\right)\\psi\\ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 is assumed to coincide with @xmath70 to the lowest order . increasing the order in @xmath71 the higher order multipoles are given by @xmath72 we integrate in time the system ( [ thetazero],[thetaone ] , [ tc2],[tcl ] ) until @xmath73 occurs , thereafter integrating the complete equations ; of course , care is taken that the results do not depend at all on this choice .",
    "we take adiabatic initial conditions : at early times @xmath74 ( all the velocity are initially zero ) and the second member in equation ( [ phi ] ) at @xmath75 is proportional for each fourier mode to the initial perturbation spectrum , that we define now . as we mentioned in the introduction , a well understood property of nucleated bubbles in field theory is their spatial growth ; once nucleated in a de sitter background like the inflationary one , a bubble is stretched out to super - horizon scales like the ordinary slow - rolling gaussian fluctuations .",
    "thus , although the coupling between the inflationary fields and the known sector of particle physics is unknown , a reasonable and simple assumption is that at the end of inflation bubbles simply convert their energy density distribution in matter and radiation , leaving a bubbly trace in the cosmic fluid @xcite .",
    "we parameterize the latter with the following model , that we already adopted in an earlier work @xcite : @xmath76 @xmath77 \\ \\",
    "\\left(1-{\\sigma\\over 2}\\le x\\le 1\\right)\\ , \\label{dc}\\ ] ] @xmath78 \\ \\",

    "the fourier transform @xmath82 of this perturbation may be easily calculated analytically .",
    "the spectrum is of course strongly scale dependent : all the power is essentially concentrated around the wavenumber corresponding to the bubble radius @xmath83 , while oscillations at higher @xmath84 describe the bubble shell .",
    "the constants are determined by the requests of continuity and compensation : @xmath85- % { \\sigma^{2}\\over 4\\pi^{2}}\\left(2-{\\sigma\\over 2}\\right)\\over % { 1\\over 3}\\left[1-\\left(1-{\\sigma\\over 2}\\right)^{3}\\right]+ % { \\sigma^{2}\\over 2\\pi^{2}}\\left(2-{\\sigma\\over 2}\\right)+ % { 1\\over 3}\\left[\\left(1+{\\sigma\\over 2}\\right)^{3}-1\\right]- % { \\sigma^{2}\\over 2\\pi^{2}}\\left(2+{\\sigma\\over 2}\\right)}\\ \\ . \\label{abcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physically most relevant parameters are @xmath2 and @xmath80 : the former sets the amplitude of the perturbation and the latter its comoving size . the shell thickness does not change the substance of the result , and from now on we fix @xmath86 . in order to make the following results more clear , @xmath2 is normalized with the density contrast taken in the center of the bubble at decoupling between matter and radiation .",
    "the very final thing to say is about the initial conditions in the cmb equations ( [ theta0],[theta1 ] , [ theta2],[e2],[dttlboltzmann],[elboltzmann ] ) ; everything is initially zero except for the lowest multipole of the temperature perturbation @xcite @xmath87 thus being proportional , for each fourier mode , to the initial perturbation spectrum .    in the next section",
    "we integrate the equations defined here to see how the bubbly perturbation evolves in time and how it would appear in an high resolution cmb anisotropy observation .",
    "let s put the bubbly perturbation ( [ dc ] ) as initial condition of the equations and let it evolve .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the cmb perturbation , so we take some photos at different times .",
    "first , look at figure ( 1 ) . it represents the pure temperature perturbation induced by a bubble with radius @xmath88 mpc at the indicated times expressed in redshift ; on the @xmath23-axis we can read the comoving distance from the center , and the photon propagation direction is orthogonal to the radial direction , @xmath89 , as indicated .",
    "panel @xmath90 shows the initial condition , that remains unchanged until the horizon crossing , that for the scale that we have considered occurs nearly at equivalence .",
    "panel @xmath91 shows a central deep oscillation that appears at the indicated redshift ; also , a positive crest arises at a distance corresponding roughly to the radius of the bubble . at the time",
    "indicated in panel @xmath92 an opposite oscillation occurs in the center , forming a negative crest , while the positive one is traveling outward .",
    "finally , in panel @xmath93 we can see the situation just before decoupling , thus resembling the real cmb anisotropies that we shall show in the following .",
    "a central negative spot is left , together with a well visible wave , with negative and positive crests , that is traveling outward with the sound velocity and that will be photographed by the cmb decoupling photons .",
    "up to an accuracy of percent , the relevant contribution to the perturbation is given by the lowest multipoles @xmath66 and @xmath67 , that we have used for the computations in previous works @xcite ; in each panel we have plotted the contributions from these two terms only ( thin dashed lines ) ; the difference is not visible since they agree at the level of accuracy specified .    remarkably , the same phenomenology occurs for polarization . in figure",
    "( 2 ) we plot the polarization amplitude @xmath40 defined in the previous section as a function of the comoving radial distance @xmath94 and for propagation perpendicular to the radius .",
    "the initial condition ( panel @xmath90 ) is vanishing since the first multipole of the polarization components is @xmath95 and it is coupled with the same momentum of the pure temperature perturbations , that is zero at the beginning ; physically , the reason is that polarization is coupled to acoustic oscillations that do not occur when all the modes are outside the effective horizon . at the horizon",
    "crossing , panel @xmath91 , a negative oscillation occurs , followed by an opposite one ( panel @xmath92 ) ; note that the light coming from the center is not polarized , simply because light propagating radially in a spherically symmetric problem has to be unpolarized for a pure geometric reason . just before decoupling ,",
    "a polarization wave is well visible ( panel @xmath93 ) ; it is placed at the same distance from the center as the @xmath39 wave in figure ( 1 ) ; this is an expected feature , due to the coupling between the polarization and pure temperature perturbations , manifest in the system ( [ theta0],[theta1],[theta2],[e2 ] , [ dttlboltzmann],[elboltzmann ] ) .",
    "the general phenomenology is therefore similar to the waves in a pond when a pebble is thrown into it .",
    "this is a general behavior valid for any cosmological structure having a spatially limited extension @xcite .",
    "we can physically understand this point by considering the equation for the @xmath96 multipole of the temperature perturbation ( to the lowest order in @xmath71 ) .",
    "as it is known @xcite , from ( [ thetazero],[thetaone ] ) we get @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the sound velocity of the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the right hand side contains the gravitational forcing terms , while the left hand side is just a damped wave equation . for a localized initial inhomogeneity ,",
    "the corresponding cmb perturbation propagates beyond the initial size , generating waves traveling outward with the sound velocity , and reaching the size of the sound horizon at the time we are examining it .",
    "let us consider now the numbers .",
    "the central density contrast at decoupling @xmath2 has been factored in the @xmath99-axis labels of the figures .",
    "roughly , the amplitude of @xmath39 follows the known estimates existing for linear perturbations , @xmath100 @xcite , where the hubble radius is calculated at decoupling .",
    "the polarization amplitude is roughly 10@xmath101 of the temperature perturbation ; this is also an expected result , since the lowest multipole of the polarization is coupled with the quadrupole momentum of the temperature perturbation ( @xmath102 ) that in turn is a first order effect in @xmath71 with respect to the quantities in ( [ thetazero],[thetaone ] ) , as is evident from ( [ tc2 ] ) ; the same consideration holds for the ordinary gaussian perturbations @xcite .",
    "the graphs we have shown until now were merely photos of the bubbly cmb perturbation at different times .",
    "now we want to predict in detail the cmb anisotropies . unlike gaussian scale - invariant perturbations , our bubbly cmb signal is localized and vanishes beyond a sound horizon from its center .",
    "therefore , its position along the photons path is an adjunctive degree of freedom with respect to the ordinary perturbation models and it has to be specified . because of the spherical symmetry of the bubble , it can be simply the distance @xmath103 between its center and the last scattering surface ( lss ) peak ; the latter is defined as follows .",
    "cmb photons have probability @xmath104 ( @xmath105 is the differential optical depth defined in the previous section ) to be last scattered between @xmath106 and @xmath107 ; the detailed form of @xmath108 depends on the particular cosmological scenario of course , nevertheless it is in most cases a gaussian centered around @xmath109 with width @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we define the lss peak as the point from which cmb photons were last scattered with highest probability ( maximum @xmath108 ) along the direction corresponding to the bubble center in the sky .",
    "once @xmath103 is specified , we can get the cmb anisotropies via simple line of sight integrations : @xmath111p(\\eta)d\\eta\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath112p(\\eta)d\\eta\\ , \\ ] ] where the sachs - wolfe effect on photons climbing out of the potential hills generated by the bubble , simply given by @xmath113 @xcite , has been added ; @xmath103 , @xmath114 and the propagation direction @xmath42 fix the radius @xmath94 in which we have to compute the cmb quantities in the integrals : as it is easy to see @xmath115^{1/2}\\ , \\label{los}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the direction of the radiation coming from the center of the bubble .",
    "in fact , since @xmath117 is just the causal distance covered by a photon last scattered at @xmath114 and reaching us today , equation ( [ los ] ) is obtained with simple trigonometry @xcite .",
    "also we can define naturally the useful angle @xmath118 by @xmath119 it is simply the angle between the photon propagation direction @xmath42 and the direction corresponding to photons coming from the center of the bubble in the sky .",
    "now we are ready to see the results .",
    "figure ( 3 ) shows the cmb polarization ( top ) and temperature ( bottom ) anisotropies for a bubble at decoupling and with the size indicated ; signals are plotted as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "look at the top panels first .",
    "they show the polarization anisotropy @xmath40 of the light coming from the bubble ; we recall that it represents the difference between the temperature fluctuations polarized along the axes parallel and perpendicular to the plane formed by the radial and the photon propagation direction . at small @xmath118",
    ", @xmath40 is vanishing as it must be , since the radiation coming from the bubble center is propagating radially and thus must be not polarized . the polarization wave",
    "that we have shown in figure ( 2 ) has been photographed by the decoupling photons here : it is well visible for both the bubble sizes chosen at an angular position corresponding to the sound horizon at decoupling . note that the bubble is confined to small angles ,",
    "say at about @xmath120 for the radii treated here .",
    "therefore , the polarization wave _ beyond _ the bubble size is a unique sign of its presence .",
    "also note that in each panel we have plotted three curves .",
    "the solid one correspond to a bubble exactly lying on the lss peak ( @xmath121 ) , while the short and long dashed ones correspond to a bubble lying backward ( @xmath122 ) and forward ( @xmath123 ) with respect to the lss peak : these curves allow us to see the dependence of the anisotropy on the relative disposition of the perturbation source with respect to the lss ; of course , if @xmath103 was greater than the sound horizon , no signal at all could be visible .",
    "look now at the bottom panels .",
    "it is as before , except for the fact that here is plotted the temperature anisotropy . note the central negative spot , at the same location of the bubble",
    "; again , at a sound horizon from the center , the @xmath3 wave propagating outward with the photon - baryon fluid sound velocity has been photographed by the last scattered photons .",
    "we have previously computed the curves for @xmath3 @xcite by considering only the monopole and the dipole ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) contributions to the signal ( thin continue line ) ; here we obtain again the previous results by considering all the multipoles , showing at the same time their good accuracy .    for what concerns the numbers , a comparison with figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    "shows how the cmb anisotropies are weaker than in the images of the perturbation at different times .",
    "together with the partial cancelation of the opposite signs of @xmath39 and @xmath113 , this is also because of the line of sight integration across the lss ; the size of the bubbles is comparable with the lss width , and due to the oscillating behavior of the signal , the effect of the integral is a certain weakening of the resulting signal .",
    "now , anticipating issues of the next section , we realistically predict what we should observe in the cmb sky if a bubble was really present at decoupling on the observed patch . in figure ( 4 ) we have simulated @xmath124 portions of microwave sky .",
    "first look at the bottom panel . in each point",
    "we have plotted the @xmath40 stokes parameter of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the signal consists of two components : a gaussian scale invariant adiabatic cdm spectrum @xcite and a bubble with comoving size @xmath88 mpc lying exactly on the lss ( @xmath121 ) , just like the solid line of figure ( 3 ) .",
    "this case could be realistic in the sense that if during inflation more than one field were on the scene , and at least one undergoes quantum tunneling and bubble nucleation , at reheating we should expect both the kinds of perturbation of the figure , bubbly and gaussian ; also , they simply add together if the perturbations are linear .",
    "the fascinating circular imprint of the bubble is clearly visible well over the cdm contribution ; the central density contrast in this case is @xmath125 .",
    "note that the bubble lies on the center of the figure , within @xmath10 from the center .",
    "the circular polarization wave is well visible and it is _ outside _ the bubble , as we have already pointed out .",
    "if @xmath2 is reduced , we go to the case of the upper panel , in which the bubble is also present , but with a smaller amplitude , @xmath126 . in this unlucky case",
    "the detection of the bubbly signal would require the use of more sophisticated image analysis tools than the human eye .",
    "finally , figure ( 5 ) shows the temperature signal instead of the polarization .",
    "note as the circular rings are well evident in the bottom panel , where @xmath2 is higher .",
    "again , the bubble lies in the very central region , corresponding to the small central dark spot ; the rings around are a feature of the cmb own physics and are coupled , for extension and oscillating behavior , with the polarization ones .",
    "the central dark spot is absent in the polarization case due to the symmetry constraints previously mentioned .    the cross detection , both in temperature and polarization anisotropies , of the cmb rings caused by a localized perturbation like a bubble would be a powerful check if signals like the present ones should be really detected in the future high resolution maps from map and planck @xcite .",
    "in the next section we consider the imprint of a population of bubbles on the cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "let us consider now a distribution of bubbles . our purpose is to check whether , and under which hypothesis",
    ", a distribution of bubbles is able to make a distinctive imprint on the cmb angular power spectrum : let us spend a few words to recall its definition . given a sky signal @xmath127 , the angular power spectrum is a set of coefficients @xmath128s simply defined in terms of the coefficients @xmath129 of its expansion into spherical harmonics : @xmath130 since it depends on the squared modules of the @xmath129s coefficients , it is sensitive on the anisotropy _ power _ on the angular scale @xmath131 roughly corresponding to @xmath132 degrees @xcite .",
    "this work contains some improvements with respect to previous results treating the cmb power spectrum from a distribution of bubbles @xcite : first both polarization and temperature signals are computed here , and second the signals from far bubbles , namely up to a sound horizon from the lss , are considered instead of only the closest ones at a distance of about a radius from the lss .",
    "we analyze @xmath6 zero mean cmb anisotropy maps with @xmath133 squared pixels .",
    "bubbly signals are randomly distributed within the patch , which is projected on the sky via the healpix pixelization @xcite , setting the signal outside the patch to zero ; successively , the signal is developed into spherical harmonics using fast fourier transform methods in order to get the @xmath128 coefficients .",
    "we analyze both maps containing only the signals from bubbles and the latter together with the cdm gaussian perturbations as in figures [ f4],[f5 ] .",
    "first , in order to test our analysis method , we consider only cdm fluctuations .",
    "starting from the theoretical cmb power spectrum , we simulate a patch as specified above and we extract from the latter the power spectrum itself , thus reconstructing the theoretical one . in figure [ f6 ]",
    "we plot the reconstructed and theoretical cdm power spectra for temperature ( up ) and polarization ( down ) anisotropies .",
    "the spectra are in quite good agreement ( roughly @xmath5 accuracy ) for a wide range of angular scales , corresponding to @xmath134 , while of course they disagree as approaching the dimension of the patch ( roughly corresponding to @xmath135 ) ; the oscillations in the simulated spactra are due to the sample variance on the sky patch , but for our purpose here this method works well .",
    "let us define now the distribution of the bubbles .",
    "because of the anisotropy propagation treated in the previous section , the signal on the lss contains contributions from bubbles centered at a distance that extends up to a sound horizon @xmath136 at decoupling",
    ". indicating with @xmath80 the radius of the bubbles , and with @xmath23 the fraction of volume occupied , the number of bubbles that we should consider in our patch is roughly @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the solid angle subtended by the patch in the sky and @xmath139 is the comoving distance of the lss from us . in our simulations we adopted @xmath88 mpc , so that for @xmath140 mpc a @xmath141 volume fraction is covered by roughly 600 bubbles in the specified patch .",
    "first , let us analyze the effect of the bubbles only .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows the temperature ( up ) and polarization ( down ) spectra from bubbles filling a volume from @xmath5 ( thin line ) to @xmath142 ( heavy line ) .",
    "the bubbles have central density contrast at decoupling @xmath143 .",
    "as expected for sub - horizon structures at decoupling , the whole signal lies on sub - degree angular scales , @xmath144 . in the temperature case",
    ", two region can be identified : the highest one describes the central hot spot of the bubbly signals and involves the corresponding multipoles at @xmath145 ; while the signals vanishes rapidly higher @xmath146s , it shows a sort of tail that reaches @xmath147 , and that is generated by the anisotropy sound waves treated in the previous section extending the signal nearly up to one degree , see figures [ f1],[f3],[f5 ] .",
    "the spectrum form is completely different in the case of the polarization .",
    "this is an expected feature , since the polarization signal described in the previous section does not possess the central hot spot due to the spherical symmetry of the bubble . instead , the polarization spectra contains peaks roughly at four angular scales that are related to the polarization waves departing from the center of the bubbles and extending up to about one degree and that are evident in figures [ f2],[f3],[f4 ] .",
    "let us come now to the evaluation of the scalings of the cmb power induced by bubbles . in this case all the bubbles have the same central density contrast @xmath2 , so that their power spectra scale exactly as @xmath148 .",
    "moreover , as expected for spatially uncorrelated bubbles , the amplitude is quite linear into the occupied volume fraction @xmath23 . in this work",
    "we do not show graphs relative to other radii , but since the bubbles are sub - horizon structures at decoupling @xcite , we checked that their signal scales roughly as @xmath149 ; in addition , as we mentioned in the previous section , the computation of the anisotropies causes an additional damping due to the line of sight integration across the lss : the signal therefore drops by a factor 10 passing from @xmath150 mpc to @xmath151 mpc , implying a scaling of about @xmath152 .",
    "putting together all these ingredients , and defining the bubbly spectral power as @xmath153 calculated roughly at the maximum , we can infer the follow empirical scalings : @xmath154 note that these numbers , for what concerns temperature , lead to results that are bigger by nearly a factor of 2 than the scaling inferred previously @xcite .",
    "this is probably because in our simulations more signal imprints the patch , since we considered the contributions from bubbles placed up to a cmb sound horizon away from the lss .",
    "since the recent measurements of cmb anisotropy power on sub - degree angular scales @xcite indicate values roughly at the level @xmath155 in the region interesting for us , bubbles populations with @xmath156 larger then that values are likely to be excluded .",
    "this implies the following constraint on our parameters : @xmath157 this condition is obtained considering only the power from bubbles , anyway it holds also when considering the power from gaussian cdm perturbations , simply the two perturbations mechanisms are uncorrelated , so that their powers approximatively add .",
    "indeed , figures [ f8 ] and [ f9 ] show the cmb angular power spectra in the cases in which bubbles and cdm gaussian perturbations are present in the simulated patch .",
    "also plotted are the existing data on @xmath144 @xcite . in figure [ f8 ] the bubbly distribution are taken from the @xmath158 case shown in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "as we anticipated , and as it is evident looking at figures [ f6],[f7 ] , the power from each one of the two perturbations mechanism approximatively adds . in figure [ f8 ] as example of the effect of varying @xmath2 is shown : we plotted a case in which the volume fraction is @xmath141 but @xmath159 . as a final comment , we wish to point out how there are cases in which the bubbles are present , filling a significant fraction of the volume and having properties able to influence the structure formation process between decoupling and the present , but that produce cmb power that is subdominant with respect to the gaussian cdm one : this happens roughly for @xmath160 , equivalent to @xmath161 .",
    "this is not surprising , since in these kind of non - gaussian models , the power spectrum alone does not fix completely the underlying perturbations properties , since , as it is evident from its definition ( [ cl ] ) , it is sensitive on the anisotropy power at a given angular scale .",
    "the most known inflationary model leaves traces in the form of gaussian perturbations . with these hypothesis , it uniquely marks the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "however high energy physics may be more complicated and may leave other ( and richer ) traces , in the form of non - gaussian perturbations . during inflation ,",
    "quantum tunneling phenomena may have occurred , and the nucleated bubbles may have been stretched to large and observable scales by the inflationary expansion itself . here",
    "we predict the imprint of bubbles on the cmb , both on the polarization and temperature anisotropies .",
    "we consider an analytical bubbly density perturbation at the beginning of the radiation era , parameterized by its comoving radius @xmath80 and density contrast @xmath2 .",
    "we perform its evolution via the linear cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "we find that it uniquely marks both the polarization and temperature anisotropies .",
    "then we consider a parametric distribution of bubbles and we predict its imprint on the cmb angular power spectra , as a function of the bubbles abundance and properties .    during the evolution toward decoupling , we take some photos of the bubbly cmb perturbation at different times . as expected , we find that the initial condition remains unchanged until the horizon reenter occurs , and thereafter the perturbation starts to oscillate .",
    "this behavior generates sound waves propagating outward with the sound velocity of the photon - baryon fluid and reaching the sound horizon at the time we are examining the system . at decoupling , we get the cmb anisotropies by considering the bubbly perturbation intersecting the last scattering surface .",
    "the dependence of the signal on the position of the bubble along the line of sight has been considered .",
    "the cmb polarization image of an inflationary bubble at decoupling is a series of rings concentric with the center of the bubble , extending on an angular size corresponding to the sound horizon at decoupling ( @xmath162 in the sky ) ; each ring is characterized by its own value of the stokes parameters , giving the difference of the temperature fluctuations projected on the axes parallel and perpendicular to the plane formed by the radial and photons propagation directions . as an important difference with respect to the case of temperature anisotropy , that reflects also in the cmb power spectrum from a distribution of bubbles , the light coming from the center of the bubble",
    "is not polarized , since the radial propagation in spherical symmetry is an axial symmetric problem , so that no preferred axis exists on the polarization plane .",
    "instead , temperature anisotropies are generally characterized by a strong central spot , together to the external rings .",
    "this is an important difference , that we prepare to investigate for what concerns the impact on the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "finally , the amplitude of the cmb fluctuation follows the known estimates for linear perturbations with size @xmath80 and density contrast @xmath2 : @xmath163 where @xmath2 and the hubble radius are computed at decoupling ; the amplitude of the polarization is roughly 10@xmath101 of the pure temperature one , as the ordinary gaussian perturbations .    to compute the cmb power spectra induced by a population of bubbles , we simulate @xmath6 cmb sky patches in which they are placed randomly and fill a fraction @xmath23 of the volume . by taking the angular power spectrum ,",
    "we analyze first the impact of the bubbles only on polarization and temperature .",
    "we find the signal lying entirely on sub - degree angular scales , characterized by a series of narrow peaks for polarization and a broader one for temperature , reflecting the signals from each bubble singularly .",
    "the amplitudes of these peaks depends in a rather simple manner by volume fraction , dimension and central density contrast of the bubbles , from which we infer an empirical formula giving the approximate bubbly cmb power ; we also use this formula to constrain the bubbly distribution parameters starting from existing sub - degree cmb observations .",
    "when considering bubbles together with gaussian fluctuations from slow roll inflation , as realistical if a bubble nucleating era occurred before the end of inflation , we find gaussian and bubbly cmb power spectra approximatively add because of their uncorrelation .",
    "bubbly density perturbations are remnant of inflationary tunneling phenomena .",
    "their detection would bring an invaluable insight into the hidden sector of high energy physics . in this work cmb bubbly signals",
    "have been computed and could be compared with the data from the future high resolution observations provided by the map and the planck missions in the next decade .",
