    "the linear confinement disappears such that the charge mobility is enhanced .",
    "albeit disappearance of linear confinement , the logarithmic interaction now plays the leading role and renders a metallic behavior .",
    "it is widely believed that the confinement - deconfinement transition temperature @xmath7 as a function of @xmath140 starts from origin @xmath171 in @xmath12-@xmath140 plane and roughly monotonically increases with the increase of @xmath140.@xcite doping holes in general depletes the spinon condensation fraction such that @xmath172 decreases with the increase of doping @xmath10 , so does the coupling constant @xmath140 which is defined as @xmath173 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath7 should monotonically decrease .",
    "consequently , we identify @xmath7 as the metal - insulator transition temperature scale observed in in - plane resistivity measurement.@xcite the order parameter of this transition is so - called `` polyakov - line''@xcite : @xmath174 with @xmath175 and @xmath176 the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath177 if @xmath178 , which characterizes the preservation ( breaking ) of central group .",
    "the polyakov - line was ever utilized in `` short - range order phase '' of hubbard model by wiegmann@xcite but in quite a different context .",
    "finally , we obtain the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_hole]-a .",
    "starting from the present understanding on localization , quantitative study of charge transport is quite interesting and will be extensively addressed in our future work .      at the end of the discussion , we in particular emphasize the novel vortex - core structure near half - filling . in fig .",
    "[ figure_hole]-b , a quantized unit electric charge ( i.e. holon , the blue ball ) is surrounded by spinful supercurrent . for the lower holon ,",
    "the supercurrent is counter - clockwise ; for the upper holon , the existence of the extra @xmath153 phase - vortex ( red directional circle ) leads to net clockwise supercurrent . in analog to nernst effect@xcite in which vortex is formed by electric supercurrent , we predict that there is a dual - type effect if one can polarize spinful vorticity along @xmath179-direction ( cuprate sample is put in xy - plane ) .",
    "then , by applying temperature gradient along @xmath61-direction , one can measure net spin accumulation at the two edges of @xmath62-direction .",
    "in conclusion , the present work provides a semi - quantitative quantum field - theoretic analysis on the long - standing problem : can electric charge be intrinsically localized in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ? .",
    "the monopole plasma configuration which comes from the antiferromagnetic background is proved to play fundamental role of driving charged holes into localized states .",
    "although it is a technical challenge to determine the concrete range of parameter @xmath180 in which the result makes sense from the present semi - quantitative analysis , our work has proved that the pure @xmath0-@xmath1 model itself has the _ intrinsic ability _ to stabilize such translation symmetry breaking phase without the help of external disorder / impurity , which fundamentally differentiates the present localized ground state from anderson localization .",
    "this result is a reasonable answer to the recent stm experimental finding and consistent to the phase string argument for dmrg numerical simulation of ladder systems .",
    "apart from this result , we also figure out the finite temperature phase diagram and especially theoretically explain the mechanism of metal - insulator transition found in electric in - plane resistivity measurement , which sheds light on a new way to reorganize transport experimental findings in curates in a single framework .",
    "a much more quantitative study along the present perspective is important and will be leaved to future work .",
    "we are especially grateful to zheng - yu weng and yayu wang for enlightening discussions during preparation of the work .",
