    "diagnostic should be the spectral shape , in particular whether the atic / ppb - bets peak is spiky or smooth . in this regard ,",
    "it is remarkable that an astrophysical source can make a peak with a sharp cutoff that is similar to the dark matter predictions , if the source is a transient object like a grb ( ioka 2008 ) .",
    "however , other astrophysical sources like pulsars , snrs or microquasars are not transient and expected to have a finite spread in the cutoff , as suggested by ioka ( 2008 ) .",
    "more importantly , due to the collimated emission , there are many off - axis pulsars that have not been observed via electromagnetic radiation , and we expect integrated contributions from multiple sources to the spectral shape , considering the birth rate of pulsars in our galaxy .",
    "in addition , recently the fermi large area telescope has measured the electron spectrum up to @xmath8 that is roughly proportional to @xmath9 without any spectral peak as reported by atic / ppb - bets ( abdo et al .",

    "collaboration also provides the electron spectrum ( aharonian et al .",
    "2008b , 2009 ) , which is consistent with the fermi result up to @xmath8 and shows the steep drop of the flux above that energy . the fermi data , however , should has a large systematic error in the high energy range ( @xmath10 ) where a significant fraction of electrons are removed to avoid a large hadron contamination , and so the real flux is estimated not by the pure experimental data but by the monte carlo simulations ( moiseev et al . 2007 ) .",
    "on the other hand the atic data contains the larger statistical errors than the fermi data .",
    "therefore we can not judge which observations are more reliable so far .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of continuous and multiple pair injections on the observed electron / positron spectrum .",
    "we show that the flux above the peak energy does not drop off abruptly but remain finite if the pair injection continues for a finite time and suggest that we may measure the source duration from the peak width .",
    "we also show that an average spectrum from multiple sources is relatively flat as reported by fermi and the atic / ppb - bets peak requires a single ( or a few ) extraordinary energetic source(s ) .",
    "we discuss the range of physical parameters of the sources ( total electron / positron energy , the source duration , etc . ) that are consistent with the current observational data .",
    "we assume that a point - like source starts injecting @xmath6 pairs at the time @xmath11 with total energy @xmath12 at a distance @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) from the earth .",

    "here we assume the continuous injection with a power - law spectrum : @xmath27 .",
    "we can obtain the observed spectrum for an arbitrary type of injection using the green s function of the equation ( [ diff ] ) , derived in atoyan et al .",

    "@xmath40^{-1}$ ] .",
    "once we assume the injection rate @xmath41 , we can obtain the observed electron / positron spectrum by integrating ( [ green ] ) over @xmath30 : @xmath42    note that the initial time of the integration should be set as @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we consider two types of continuous injection .",
    "one is the pulsar - type decay : @xmath44    this is the similar function of time as the spin - down luminosity of a pulsar with a surface magnetic field @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the pulsar period normalized by 10msec and @xmath47 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the other is the exponential decay : @xmath48 which may be realized by a pulsar that initially confines @xmath6 in its nebula and releases them afterward , by a snr that accelerates protons and continues to inject them to the surrounding dense gas cloud until it is destroyed , or by a microquasar ceasing its activity . in both types of injection ,",
    "the characteristic time scale of the duration @xmath49 is defined to be the time when the rate becomes four times smaller than the initial one .    in fig .  1 we show the electron plus positron flux resulting from above two injection models in addition to the transient model ( @xmath50 ) and the background flux , which is conventionally attributed to supernova remnants , by 30% because the fitting functions provide larger flux than the atic data even without other contributions . ] ( dotted line ) .",
    "the remarkable point is that an astrophysical source can make a spectral peak that is similar to the atic / ppb - bets excess and also to the dark matter case ( ioka 2008 ) .",
    "the peak energy is determined by the age of the source @xmath51 as @xmath52^{-1 } , \\label{peak}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the electrons / positrons with initially higher energy cool down via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering within time @xmath51 .",
    "we can inversely estimate the source age as @xmath53 from the peak energy for @xmath54 .",
    "note that the peak flux is almost independent of the distance @xmath55 if it is smaller than the diffusion length ( @xmath14 in our case ) .    as is clear from fig .  1 , the spectral cutoff becomes shallower for the continuous injection models than the transient one ( @xmath50 ; short dot - dashed line ) .",
    "this is because the significant fraction of @xmath6 pairs are produced recently ( i.e. injected long after the birth of the source ) and they have shorter time for the energy loss via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering .",
    "then their energy is still higher than the peak energy when they reach the earth , and they produce a broader peak .",
    "the thick solid line represents the total ( the primary plus background electron and positron ) flux assuming that the source starts emitting @xmath6 pairs with total energy @xmath56 , a power - law index @xmath57 and a maximum energy @xmath58 at a distance @xmath14 from the earth a time @xmath59 ago , and decays exponentially with the duration of @xmath60 .",
    "this model looks better for the atic / ppb - bets peak , though we can not conclude that the duration is finite with the current data .",
    "the positron fraction predicted from this parameter set is also consistent with the pamela results , in almost the same way as fig .  1 of ioka ( 2008 ) .    in the case of pulsar - type injection , there is another interesting spectral feature resulting from a long duration . in fig .  1 ,",
    "the high energy tail above the peak energy is more enhanced for the long duration case ( @xmath61 , double dashed line ) than the short duration case ( @xmath62 , long dashed line ) .",
    "this is because the longer the duration of injection is , the larger fraction of @xmath6 pairs are freshly produced and they do not lose their energy during the propagation so much ( see also atoyan et al .",
    "especially , the flux of the long duration model may exceed the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations around @xmath63 if we add the background ( dotted line ) while that of the short duration model does not . as the errorbars are still large",
    ", however , we should await future observations .",
    "next , let us consider multiple sources .",
    "we expect several younger or older pulsars than that in fig .  1 of age @xmath64 , considering the local birth rate of pulsars @xmath65 ( narayan 1984 ; lorimer et al . 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , the total energy @xmath66 in fig .",
    "1 is as large as the rotation energy of a pulsar @xmath67 with a period of @xmath68 .",
    "this is comparable with the fastest initial spin estimated from the observations of radio pulsars ( kaspi & helfand 2002 ) , so the pair output efficiency @xmath69 may be too large @xmath70 to account for the excess with a single pulsar .",
    "we can calculate the average electron and positron spectrum by considering the nearby multiple pulsars with a certain birth rate in the following way .",
    "once @xmath31 is fixed , we can neglect the contribution from pulsars older than @xmath71 and farther than @xmath72 as is obvious from the functional form of eq.([green ] ) .",
    "then the average flux can be calculated by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the local pulsar birth rate ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath76 is the number of pulsars which contribute to the flux at the energy @xmath31 , and @xmath77 is the average electron flux per pulsar . here",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath74 as the birth rate per unit surface area because pulsars are born from a disk whose thickness ( @xmath78 ) is much smaller than the diffusion length of cosmic - rays ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 show the average electron spectra and the positron fraction , respectively , obtained by assuming that each pulsar emits electrons with the total amount of energy of @xmath80 , the spectral index of @xmath81 , and the birth rate of @xmath82 ( thick solid lines ) .",
    "in addition , we can calculate the dispersion of the number of pulsars @xmath83 from the average @xmath84 for each energy bin as @xmath85 which is based on the poisson distribution of nearby pulsars .",
    "then we can estimate the flux dispersion as @xmath86    from fig.2 and 3 we can see that the average spectra are basically consistent with fermi , h.e.s.s . and pamela data . in the high energy range ( @xmath87 ) , the dispersion from the average flux become significant .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the pulsars which contribute to the electron and positron flux in such a high energy band should be young , @xmath88 and close to the earth , @xmath89 where we adopt @xmath24 .",
    "the number of such pulsars should be as small as @xmath90    therefore , in the tev range few pulsars can contribute to the electron / positron flux .",
    "this small number of pulsars may naturally account for the spectral cutoff around @xmath91 energy , which has been inferred by the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations . strictly speaking ,",
    "this estimation of the pulsar number dispersion is not correct in the energy range of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and the statistical arguments become meaningless .",
    "however this interpretation of the spectral drop around this energy is still qualitatively correct .",
    "moreover , fig.2 shows that the atic / ppb - bets peak flux ( @xmath94 ) is much larger than the average flux added with the dispersion flux @xmath95 at the same energy bin . in fact , the separation between the average flux and the atic data of the peak flux at that energy is @xmath96 .",
    "then , if all pulsars emit electrons with the total energy of @xmath2 , the number of pulsars which contribute to the energy bin of the atic / ppb - bets should be unrealistically large at the 10@xmath97 level .",
    "this means that if the atic / ppb - bets peak is real , it does not seem to be produced by the collective contribution from multiple pulsars with the moderate amount of electron energy ( @xmath98 ) but by a single ( or a few ) energetic pulsar(s ) ( @xmath99 ) accordingly .",
    "however , in order to fit the pamela spectrum in the lower energy range at the same time , such a hard spectrum is not favored . ] .",
    "the discussion above is about the fluctuation of the number of pulsars with a certain birth rate , and it is based on the poisson statistics . strictly speaking , in order to discuss the cosmic ray electron / positron fluctuations due to the random injections , one should evaluate not the dispersion of the source number but the dispersion of the electron / positron flux at each energy bin as @xmath100    the first integral in eq.([fluxdisp ] ) contains , however , a serious divergence because of the large ( but improbable ) contribution from very young and nearby sources ( lee 1979 ; berezinskii et al .",
    "1990 ; lagutin and nikulin 1995 ; ptuskin et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to obtain the realistic estimate of the flux dispersion",
    ", we introduce a lower cutoff parameter @xmath101 to the time integral",
    ". then we have @xmath102    following ptuskin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we adopt the cutoff parameter as @xmath103^{-1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & 10 ^ 5{\\rm yr}\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_e}{500{\\rm gev}}\\right)^{-1/6}\\left ( \\frac{r}{1/(1.5\\times 10 ^ 5){\\rm yr}^{-1}{\\rm kpc}^{-2 } } \\right)^{-1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which takes into account the absence of very young and nearby sources .",
    "this choice of @xmath104 is reasonable as long as this time is much shorter than @xmath105 , which means @xmath106 .",
    "then the ratio of the flux dispersion to the average flux ( [ ave ] ) can be expressed as @xmath107    we can see that these two ` dispersions ' ( eq.([numdisp ] ) and eq.([fluxdisp2 ] ) ) give the similar results around the energy of the atic / ppb - bets peak . therefore ,",
    "from either of the above discussions , we can say that the atic / ppb - bets data of the spectral peak is so largely separated from the average flux that they do not seem to be produced by the multiple contribution from nearby pulsars with moderate energy .",
    "we should note that the h.e.s.s .",
    "data put constraints on the total @xmath6 pair energy from young sources .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "2 the electron spectrum from the source with the age of @xmath108 so as not to exceed the observational upper limit inferred by the h.e.s.s . data in the tev range ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "we find that the total energy of such young sources should be , if exist , @xmath109 which is two orders - of - magnitude smaller than the energy of the source making the atic / ppb - bets peak .",
    "we investigate the astrophysical origin for the pamela and atic / ppb - bets excesses and in particular the effects of the finite duration and the multiple sources on the electron and positron spectra , as expected for pulsars , snrs and microquasars .",
    "we find the followings :    \\(1 ) a non - transient source can make a spectral peak that is similar to the atic / ppb - bets excess ( see fig .",
    "1 ) around the peak energy in eq .  ( [ peak ] ) .",
    "the peak is generally broad with a width @xmath110 which could provide a method to measure the source duration @xmath49 by the fermi satellite ( an energy resolution of 5 - 20% in 20gev-1tev range ; moiseev et al .",
    "2007 ) or the future calet experiments ( a few % above 100gev ; torii et al .",
    "although atoyan et al . ( 1995 ) have already pointed out the effects of finite duration of the source on the electron spectrum , they only mention the enhancement of the high energy tail above the spectral peak ( see below ) and never discuss the peak width . note that the peak width is also produced by the spatial fluctuation of galactic magnetic field and the photon density because the energy loss rate of @xmath6 fluctuates during the propagation , as estimated in ioka ( 2008 ) ( see also malyshev et al .",
    "we also note that the peak becomes smoother if the injection rises gradually in its initial stage .",
    "( 2 ) the spectrum from a long duration source has a high energy tail above the peak energy ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "especially the flux of this tail plus the background may exceed the h.e.s.s .",
    "data points when assuming a pulsar - type decay with a duration @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that the source making the atic / ppb - bets peak is not likely a single pulsar with magnetic fields weaker than a few times @xmath112 .",
    "the existence of this tail has been already pointed out before ( atoyan et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , we firstly present the quantitative argument for the observational limit of the duration of the electron / positron source in the context of the high energy tail thanks to the observational developments in the tev range .",
    "one should note that we can not rule out the long - duration pulsar model if the maximum energy of injected @xmath6 pairs is smaller than @xmath113 , or the injection is not the pulsar - type in eq .  ( 5 ) but the exponential - type in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , for example .",
    "the latter is possible if high energy pairs generated in the pulsar magnetosphere are not injected into the space instantaneously but initially confined in a pulsar wind nebula ( chi et al .",
    "1996 ) and they diffuse out after the nebula gets broken .",
    "\\(3 ) the h.e.s.s .",
    "data suggest that young sources with age less than @xmath114 should be , if exist , two orders - of - magnitude less energetic than the source making the atic / ppb - bets peak . note that the lifetime of the pulsar nebula is around @xmath115 and younger pulsars may not be able to contribute by the cosmic - ray confinement in the nebula .",
    "\\(4 ) the average electron spectrum and positron fraction is well consistent with the h.e.s.s./fermi and pamela data , respectively , taking into account the dispersion predicted from the total electron energy per pulsar of @xmath2 with the local birth rate of @xmath116 .",
    "especially , when @xmath87 , we expect a large dispersion of the electron flux because of the small number of sources which are young and close to the earth and can significantly contribute to that energy range .",
    "this fact can naturally account for the spectral drop around @xmath117 indicated by the h.e.s.s .",
    "note that the value of the total electron energy per pulsar adopted here is within reasonable range .",
    "in fact , the pulsar whose initial spin period is around @xmath68 can emit electrons and positrons with energy @xmath118 if we assume the efficiency of @xmath119 , which seems to be reasonable ( hooper et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "moreover , we show that the atic / ppb - bets data point showing the peak at @xmath94 is largely separated from the average flux , when considering the theoretical dispersion from the average .",
    "this fact suggests that the peak is hard to produce by multiple contributions and requires a single ( or a few ) extraordinary pulsar(s ) whose total electron / positron energy is about a hundred ( several tens ) times larger than that of ordinary pulsars .",
    "here we estimate the dispersion of the electron / positron flux based on the analytical expressions ( eq .",
    "( 9),(12 ) or ( 17 ) ) using the averaged local birth rate of pulsars .",
    "this method enables us to take into account the off - axis pulsars whose existence is suggested by the observed pulse shape of pulsars , and it is different from the method used in malyshev et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who calculate some realizations of the spectra predicted from the known pulsars in the atnf catalogue .",
    "note that the different choice of the diffusion coefficient @xmath120 would change the results quantitatively .",
    "the smaller @xmath121 makes the diffusion length @xmath122 smaller , and the particle density inside that radius gets higher , being proportional to @xmath123 ( see eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) ) . for different @xmath124 instead of @xmath121 , we can apply our results by re - scaling the distance of each pulsar and the total @xmath6 injection energy as @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .    in our calculations",
    "we evaluate the dispersion of the electron flux due to the random birth of nearby pulsars in time and space having uniform total energy and injection index . in the case",
    "that these pulsars have a distribution of energy with a dispersion of @xmath127 , the total dispersion of the energy is averaged as @xmath128 , and when the electron energy is smaller than @xmath129 ( i.e. @xmath130 is much larger than unity ) the total dispersion is suppressed compared to the total flux @xmath131 .",
    "the spectral index of the injected electrons should also be varied .",
    "however , the dispersion of the flux is almost determined by the amount of the electron energy emitted from pulsars , and the fluctuation of the index would not contribute to the flux dispersion so much .",
    "the spatial variation of the energy loss rate and the diffusion coefficient can also affect to the observed electron flux or positron fraction .",
    "the energy loss rate @xmath132 can fluctuate along the propagation path of electrons because of the inhomogeneities of the radiation and magnetic field , and then the cutoff shape of the resulting electron spectra would be broadened according to the amplitude of the fluctuation .",
    "such a feature may be resolved by the future calet experiment ( see ioka 2008 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of the spatial variation of the diffusion coefficient are considered in cowsik & burch ( 2009 ) in the context of `` nested leaky box model '' . in this model",
    "the positron fraction can be explained as a result of the different diffusion coefficient between the source - surrounding region and the general interstellar space .",
    "we can expect gamma - ray emission from high energy @xmath6 pairs .",
    "especially , the number of such energetic objects can be simply estimated as @xmath133 .",
    "this is comparable with that of tev unidentified sources , which have no clear counterpart at other wavelengths ( aharonian et al .",
