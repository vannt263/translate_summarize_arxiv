    "the theory of @xmath0-expansions originates with the works of rnyi @xcite and parry @xcite , where an important link to symbolic dynamics has been established .",

    "in particular , one can ask questions of the form , for what class of numbers the greedy and lazy @xmath0-shifts have given properties and vice versa .",
    "in fact , although the arithmetical , diophantine and ergodic properties of the greedy and lazy @xmath0-shifts have been extensively studied ( see @xcite and references therein ) , there are many open problems of this form .",
    "further , applications of this theory to the efficiency of analog - to - digital conversion have been explored in @xcite . moreover , through understanding @xmath0-expansions of real numbers , advances have been made in understanding bernoulli convolutions .",
    "for literature in this direction , we refer the reader to @xcite and reference therein .",

    "observe that , when @xmath31 , the maps @xmath32 and @xmath33 coincide , and when @xmath34 , the maps @xmath35 and @xmath36 coincide. here we make the observation that for all @xmath37 , the symbolic space @xmath19 associated to @xmath27 is always a subshift , meaning that it is closed and invariant under the left shift map ( see corollary  [ cor : shift_invarance ] ) .",
    "the maps @xmath27 are sometimes also called linear lorenz maps and arise naturally from the poincar maps of the geometric model of lorenz differential equations .",

    "the intermediate @xmath0-transformations and @xmath0-shifts are the main topic of study , and thus , to illustrate their importance we recall some of the known results in this area .",
    "parry @xcite proved that any topological mixing interval map with a single discontinuity is topologically conjugate to a map on the form @xmath27 where @xmath37 .",

    "our main results , theorems  [ thm : sftandtransitive ] and [ thm : esftp ] and corollary  [ cor : fiberssft ] , contribute to the ongoing efforts in determining the dynamical properties of the intermediate @xmath0-shifts and examining whether these properties also hold for the counterpart greedy and lazy @xmath0-shifts .",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to construct pairs @xmath21 such that the associated intermediate @xmath0-shift is a subshift of finite type but for which the maps @xmath27 are not transitive .",
    "in contrast to this , the corresponding greedy and lazy @xmath0-shifts are not subshifts of finite type ( neither sofic shifts , namely a factor of a subshift of finite type ) and , moreover , the maps @xmath32 and @xmath35 are transitive . recall that an interval map @xmath41 \\circlearrowleft$ ] is called _ transitive _ if and only if for all open subintervals @xmath42 of @xmath15 $ ] there exists @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .    to prove the transitivity part of our result we apply a result of palmer @xcite and glendinning @xcite , where it is shown that for any @xmath45 the maps @xmath32 and @xmath35 are transitive .",

    "this leads us to the final problem of studying how a greedy ( or lazy ) @xmath0-shift being a subshift of finite type is related to the corresponding intermediate @xmath0-shifts being a subshift of finite type .",
    "we already know that it is possible to find intermediate @xmath0-shifts of finite type in the fibres @xmath83 even though the corresponding greedy and lazy @xmath0-shifts are not subshift of finite type . given this , a natural question to ask is , can one determine when no intermediate @xmath0-shift is a subshift of finite type , for a given fixed @xmath0 .",

    "<S> this is in contrast to the situation for the corresponding greedy and lazy @xmath0-shifts and @xmath0-transformations , for which both of the two properties do not hold . </S>"
