    "in the last one year , vacuum string field theory ( vsft ) , which was first proposed by rastelli , sen and zwiebach in  @xcite as a candidate for the theory which describes the open string dynamics around the tachyon vacuum , has intensively been studied . in the early days , it was recognized  @xcite that the matter part of the equation of motion reduced to an equation satisfied by any projection operator if we assume that the classical solution representing a d - brane factorized into the ghost part and the matter part , because the kinetic operator @xmath2 of vsft was supposed to be made purely out of ghost fields .",
    "such projectors , which are squared to itself under the @xmath0-product of string field theory , have been constructed algebraically as ` sliver states '  @xcite in the matter sector . without any knowledge of the ghost sector ,",
    "the ratios of tensions of classical sliver solutions with different dimensions were calculated and were shown to agree numerically with the known results about the ratios of d - brane tensions .",
    "after that , the sliver states were reconstructed in terms of boundary conformal field theory  @xcite and were interpreted as rank - one projection ` operators ' in the sense that they operated in the space of half - string functionals  @xcite .",
    "research in the ghost sector has started with the work of hata and kawano  @xcite , who showed that it was possible to determine the form of @xmath2 uniquely by requiring the existence of the siegel gauge solution .",
    "this work , written in terms of operator language , was refined by one of us  @xcite and okuyama  @xcite .",
    "another choice of @xmath2 was proposed by gaiotto , rastelli , sen and zwiebach in  @xcite , where they considered a local ghost insertion at the midpoint of the open string .",
    "surprisingly , it was also shown  @xcite that these two candidates for @xmath2 , which appeared to have different origins , coincided numerically with each other .",
    "although the construction of vacuum string field theory has been completed this way , we are not allowed to compute the absolute values of tensions of the brane solutions defined as the on - shell scattering amplitude of three ` tachyons ' ( so - called hk state ) living on the brane solution , and suggested that the classical solution found in  @xcite corresponded to the configuration of two d25-branes from the energetic aspects .",
    "later , it was pointed out in  @xcite that this claim was not valid on the ground that the authors of  @xcite had used the equation of motion for their ` tachyon state ' which in fact had not been satisfied in a strong sense . ] because this theory arises as such a singular limit that it needs some regularization for this purpose .",
    "moreover , it seems difficult to reproduce the known physical spectrum of d - branes from the brane solutions in vacuum string field theory . even though we could specify the ` on - shell tachyon state ' with mass @xmath3  @xcite , it would be a hard task to impose the transversality conditions on the vector ( tensor ) fields , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath4 , if we start from the kinetic operator @xmath2 which is completely independent of the matter sector and the factorized solutions .",
    "confronted with these difficulties , we have been led to consider the solutions which contain the brst operator @xmath5 or something in them . in fact , such attempts were made in the purely cubic formulation of string field theory  @xcite about 15 years ago . there ,",
    "horowitz _ et.al .",
    "_ showed that it was possible to construct solutions of the form @xmath6 in the original cubic open string field theory ( osft ) such that there were no physical open string excitations around them .",
    "however , their arguments crucially depended on the formal properties of the identity string field @xmath7 , which made the arguments less persuasive .    in this paper , we will consistently deal with the identity string field in terms of the conformal field theory language , never relying on any formal property such as @xmath8 for every @xmath9 . the generalized gluing and resmoothing theorem allows us to carry out concrete calculations fully within our framework .",
    "we will show that the identity string field @xmath7 defined this way actually acts as the identity element of the @xmath0-algebra in some situations .",
    "thus , one of the aims of this paper is to establish how to treat the identity state using conformal field theory in a definite manner .",
    "furthermore , this computational scheme will be used to propose a possible form of the tachyon vacuum solution .",
    "more precisely , we consider a specific configuration of the string field including the identity state and the brst operator , and show that this configuration indeed solves the equation of motion derived from the ordinary cubic string field theory action defined on a d25-brane .",
    "expanded around this solution , the action takes the same form as the conjectured vacuum string field theory action !",
    "hence we guess that our solution corresponds to the tachyon vacuum in some singular frame .",
    "we further discuss that the deformation of this solution may lead to a regularized version of the vsft action postulated in  @xcite , though not so conclusive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we explain our definitions of string field theory vertices and of identity string field in the cft language , which will be used throughout the rest of this paper . in section  [ sec:4 ] , we describe our main computational tool , namely the generalized gluing and resmoothing theorem , and derive a general formula for gluing functions .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] is devoted to technical calculations used later .",
    "the readers who are interested only in the relation between vsft and osft can skip sections  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] , but should not forget that our calculations have been done based consistently on the cft prescription . in section  [ sec : vsft ]",
    "we propose a solution which connects osft to vsft . in section",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss some open problems and present possible future directions .",
    "[ sec:3 ]      in this paper we will adopt the conformal field theory description of the string field theory vertices  @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the bpz inner product and the 3-string vertex are defined as @xmath10 respectively , where @xmath11 denotes the conformal transform of the vertex operator @xmath12 by the conformal map @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the correlation function among the vertex operators evaluated on an upper half - plane ( uhp ) , and the conformal maps are defined by @xmath15 where we have for convenience defined an @xmath16 map @xmath17 through @xmath18 @xmath19 takes an upper half - plane @xmath20 to the inside of a unit disk @xmath21 in a one - to - one way .",
    "the state - operator isomorphism has been used to map any state @xmath22 to the corresponding vertex operator @xmath12 ( with a slight abuse of notation ) via the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath25-invariant vacuum .",
    "more detailed explanations are found in  @xcite .      instead of taking the state @xmath26 to be an identity element of the @xmath0-algebra of string field theory , we will throughout define it by the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 in terms of the conformal field theory language .",
    "the reason why the state @xmath29 defined this way may be considered as the ` identity ' element of open string field theory is that the conformal map @xmath30 geometrically realizes the overlap of left- and right - halves of the open string ( fig.[fig : id ] ) , originally referred to as the integration operation @xmath31 for an open string field in  @xcite .",
    "[ 0.8].,title=\"fig : \" ]    then it perfectly makes sense to ask whether or not @xmath7 really behaves itself like the identity element under the @xmath0-multiplication .",
    "in fact , we will show in section  [ sec:5 ] that @xmath8 certainly holds true for a large class of states @xmath9 .",
    "in general , a wedge state @xmath32 of an angle @xmath33 was defined in  @xcite as @xmath34 with @xmath35 hence , our definition of @xmath29 coincides with that of the wedge state @xmath36 of an angle @xmath37 .    for convenience",
    ", here we collect some results which will be obtained in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "below , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote arbitrary fock space states , _",
    "i.e. _ those which can be created by the action of local vertex operators on the @xmath25-invariant vacuum as @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath0-multiplication formulae including @xmath26 are : @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents a local vertex operator or a contour - integrate of it . from these equations",
    ", @xmath7 actually looks like an identity element of the @xmath0-algebra when we restrict ourselves to the above settings .",
    "the brst operator @xmath5 , which governs the perturbative behavior of open strings living on a d25-brane , satisfies the following relations : @xmath44 which have been at the heart of the manipulations in purely cubic string field theory  @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 will be defined in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "eq.([eq : ae ] ) holds for @xmath46 in a class larger than that consisting of the fock space states .",
    "[ sec:4 ] in the cft formulation of string field theory , it is helpful to make use of so - called generalized gluing and resmoothing theorem ( ggrt ) , which has been developed in  @xcite , as a computational scheme . after reviewing the geometrical aspects of the gluing theorem following  @xcite in subsection  [ subsec:41 ] , we will derive a general formula for conformal mappings from the original surfaces to the sewed surface , paying great attention to the problem of precisely defining the range of angles .",
    "let us suppose that we are given @xmath47- and @xmath48-point correlation functions on disks @xmath49 , respectively , defined by @xmath50 where @xmath13 s and @xmath51 s represent conformal maps each of which embeds a unit upper half - disk defining a local coordinate system into the corresponding region in @xmath52 or @xmath53 ( as shown in fig .",

    "the rle of this sewing procedure is played by the conformal maps @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "since both of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are wedges , we expect that desired maps @xmath91 can be obtained by combining the rigid rotations of the wedges around the origin with the changes of angles of the wedges .",

    "thinking in reverse order , it might be possible to determine @xmath351 by requiring that the value of the action @xmath411 be equal to the negative of the energy of a single d25-brane , @xmath412 , where @xmath413 represents the volume of the 26-dimensional spacetime and @xmath414 denotes the tension of the d25-brane .",
    "using the relation  @xcite @xmath415 the equation we want to solve becomes @xmath416 where the expression for @xmath417 has been given in eq.([eq : ea ] ) .",
    "if we could solve this equation with respect to @xmath351 , the result of which is expected to diverge in some sense , then there would remain no unfixed parameter in the theory around @xmath337 ( and presumably in vsft ) .",
    "but unfortunately , it has turned out that @xmath417 is quite badly - behaved . for example , we have obtained . ]",
    "@xmath418v_{26 } , \\label{eq : xg}\\ ] ] where @xmath419 is a regularization parameter introduced to deform the identity state in a way indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pacman ] .",
    "[ 0.7 ]    to be more specific , the regularized identity state is defined by @xmath420 this regularization is necessary because if we navely apply the gluing theorem to the expression of the form @xmath421 then we are left with an ill - defined expression .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that we can not take the @xmath422 limit in eq.([eq : xg ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath417 has not been successful up to now , and is under investigation  @xcite .      since the action @xmath423 in  ( [ eq",
    ": eh ] ) has been obtained by expanding the original action @xmath424  ( [ eq : a ] ) around the classical solution @xmath425 , we can recover the action @xmath424 by re - expanding the ` vsft action ' @xmath423 around the solution @xmath426 as @xmath427 , and it is obvious that this solution represents a single d25-brane .",
    "as remarked in a footnote of section  [ sec : vsft ] , however , the action @xmath423 given in  ( [ eq : eh ] ) has been shown to be valid only for @xmath377 lying in the fock space .",
    "since the above solution @xmath428 is outside the fock space in a narrow sense , it may not be correct to suppose the theory around @xmath337 to be literally described by the action @xmath423 in this case .",
    "nevertheless , we shall have arguments below on the assumption that the theory around @xmath337 is really governed by @xmath423 .",
    "if we are to regard @xmath423 as representing the vacuum string field theory under an appropriate choice of the normalization constant @xmath351 , then we must be able to construct other d - brane solutions than the original single d25-brane , that is to say , lower - dimensional d - branes , multiple d - branes , and so forth .",
    "however , as pointed out in  @xcite , it seems difficult to produce spatially localized solutions if we adhere to the identity - type solution of the form  ( [ eq : xh ] ) .",
    "it is true that once a d25-brane  ( [ eq : xh ] ) has been constructed lower - dimensional d - branes could be obtained as lump solutions on the d25-brane via tachyon condensation at least in the level truncation scheme  @xcite , but it is obviously desirable to build them directly .    in this connection",
    ", we also give a brief comment on the possible relation to the projector - type solutions which have been examined in the context of vacuum string field theory  @xcite . if both the identity - type solution  ( [ eq : xh ] ) and one of the spatially - independent projector - type solutions represent one and only d25-brane , they should be related to each other through some gauge transformation .",
    "we do not know whether such a surprising thing could happen .",
    "the following is a well - known argument : since @xmath430 acts as a derivation of the @xmath0-algebra , it follows that @xmath431 for a _ true identity state _ @xmath7 and for any @xmath9 . for this equation to hold , we must have @xmath432 , which is not the case  @xcite .",
    "hence one is tempted to conclude that there does not exist such a true identity state . though this conclusion may be true in a sense , the above argument is too strong .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to have @xmath433 rather than @xmath432 .",
    "that is to say , there is no problem in eq.([eq : xi ] ) if we show that @xmath429 gives zero whenever it is @xmath0-multiplied by an arbitrary element . in the operator language",
    ", this statement is equivalent to the relation @xmath434 , and it was shown in  @xcite that it is indeed true .",
    "from the point of view of our present paper , we can calculate @xmath435 and see if it is equal to @xmath436 .",
    "for simplicity we take @xmath203 and @xmath322 to be fock space states .",
    "the second term of  ( [ eq : xj ] ) reduces to @xmath437 thanks to the relation  ( [ eq : ca ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the first term with the help of the gluing theorem and obtained @xmath438 contrary to our expectation .",
    "in addition , we can easily show @xmath439 directly .",
    "after all , we have found @xmath440 since there is no ambiguity in our computational scheme , something must be wrong with eq.([eq : xi ] ) .",
    "a possible resolution of this problem would be to think that it depends on the states to be acted on whether the operator @xmath430 may be regarded as a derivation .",
    "we have not reached a definite conclusion concerning this point . to have a better understanding of the identity state ,",
    "it would be important to examine the action of such outer derivations on @xmath7 in more detail .",
