    "ultrafast spectroscopy of excitons in the time domain@xcite has proven to be a powerful tool to probe quantum coherence of exciton states , which was originally studied by polarization of the stationary emission.@xcite most of the experimental data were taken from gaas quantum wells , however , some experiments were performed with bulk excitons .",
    "quantum beats in different response functions provide a manifestation of the coherence driven by external fields .",
    "these beats appear when several states having close energies are excited simultaneously .",
    "quantum beats were observed with magnetically split exciton levels,@xcite bound excitons with different confinement energies,@xcite heavy and light hole excitons,@xcite free and bound excitons,@xcite and with biexcitons and a two - exciton continuum.@xcite two last systems have much in common since they possess both a continuous spectrum and a discrete level .",
    "they will be of principal importance for us in what follows .",
    "experimental data provide convincing evidence of a strong effect of the exciton - exciton and exciton - free - carrier interaction on nonlinear response functions.@xcite however , there could not be universal approach to the theoretical treatment of this nonlinear many - electron problem .",
    "the physical patterns are rather different in different ranges of the parameter values , therefore , the theoretical approaches also should be different .",
    "when the intensity of a pump is high and the nonradiative dephasing time @xmath0 is short , the hartree - fock approximation works rather well .",
    "this approach was advanced by schmitt - rink and chemla@xcite and has been developed in a number of papers .",
    "it is based on the semiconductor bloch equations@xcite and allows a generalization accounting for two - exciton correlations.@xcite time evolution of wave packets produced by the pump also can be followed.@xcite it is a distinctive feature of this approach that the basis of the exciton and electron - hole pair states is restricted by excitations strongly coupled to the pump , i.e. , possessing the momenta of the exciting electromagnetic waves .",
    "this restriction is the basic limitation of the powerful hartree - fock method .",
    "a different approach is used in the opposite limit of low exciton densities , when the interaction of biexcitons can be neglected and the dephasing time @xmath0 is long . in this limit",
    "biexcitons can be considered as noninteracting particles , and the problem can be reduced to the dynamics of an exciton molecule in external fields .",
    "even a simple four - level biexciton energy scheme@xcite turned out to be very successful . in the framework of this scheme",
    "the biexciton continuum is substituted by a single two - exciton state .",
    "the four - level scheme allowed one to explain the existence of beats , having a period of inverse biexciton binding energy , in different nonlinear phenomena .",
    "more recently , wang _",
    "et al._@xcite have discussed the effect of the biexciton continuum on initial biexciton transients .",
    "these authors neglected the exciton - exciton interaction in the biexciton continuum and investigated quantum evolution of the relative momentum of two excitons in a molecule .",
    "our paper is related to the approach advanced in refs .  , and .",
    "developing a theory that allows for a consistent account of the biexciton continuum and the exciton - exciton interaction is the main objective of the paper .",
    "we show that the interaction of excitons and their dynamics are of critical importance for biexciton transients .",
    "our results are primary developed for an exciton in the field of a defect .",
    "this problem is of intrinsic importance and is actively studied .",
    "fast early - time evolution of the rayleigh signal from inhomogeneously broadened exciton levels was recently investigated both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite    the traditional approach to quantum beats is based on the energy spectrum comprising few , usually two , discrete energy levels .",
    "this approach can be applied to beats between heavy- and light - hole excitons because of the momentum conservation and absence of the interaction between these excitons . however , the biexciton and bound exciton problems are more involved .",
    "indeed , energy spectra of these systems include the two - exciton and single - exciton continuum , respectively .",
    "for example , for a two - exciton system it is the exciton - exciton interaction that supports the two - photon coherence , and the lower part of the continuum with the width of about several biexciton binding energies , @xmath1 , contributes to the coherent polarization along with the bound biexciton state .",
    "in addition to the theoretical arguments , the experimental data provide weighty , although indirect , evidence of the role of the two - exciton continuum . indeed , it was shown@xcite that the four - level biexciton energy scheme can be brought into agreement with experimental data only if the enhancement factor typical of giant oscillator strengths@xcite is invoked .",
    "therefore , frequencies of allowed transitions are distributed continuously and the spread of the frequencies is about @xmath1 .",
    "naive consideration suggests that such an energy spectrum should result in beats having a frequency of about @xmath1 and showing fast nondissipative decay because of accumulating phase differences between different modes .",
    "it turns out that the actual physical picture is quite different .    in this paper",
    "we present an exact solution for a free induction signal excited by a single - side exponential pulse , @xmath2 , in a nondissipative system with a biexciton nonlinearity .",
    "this signal can be observed , e.g. , as a resonance fluorescence at positive times , @xmath3 .",
    "the special shape of the pulse simplifies calculations but does not influence the basic results .",
    "the contribution of the two - exciton continuum is consistently taken into account.@xcite with such an approach , free induction , i.e. , free oscillations of a two - exciton wave function @xmath4 for @xmath3 , includes two modes .",
    "there exists _ a beating mode _ describing _ undamped beats whose frequency is equal to _ @xmath1 . damping of this mode is controlled by the mechanisms other than the exciton dispersion ( radiative decay , dephasing , polariton effects , etc . ) .",
    "there exists also _ a growing mode _ whose amplitude increases linearly with time @xmath5 and whose carrier frequency equals the energy of the bottom of the two - exciton continuum .",
    "the growing mode is inherent in interacting systems possessing a continuous spectrum .",
    "it is the inflation in a real space of the wave packet created by the pulse that manifests itself in this mode .",
    "the packet is termed an _ inflating antenna _ in what follows .",
    "the two modes result in an optically detected free induction signal that ( i ) increases with @xmath5 , ( ii ) has monotonic and oscillating parts , and ( iii ) results in ultrafast radiative decay .",
    "the same modes exist for excitons bound to impurities .",
    "both modes originate from the analytical structure of the two - exciton green function , which is specific for hamiltonians with a continuous spectrum and violated momentum conservation .",
    "we expect that these modes contribute also to different nonlinear processes , including multiple - impulse processes , and that the developed technique is of general applicability .",
    "to make clear the basic idea and account rigorously for analytical properties of the exciton green functions , we develop an exactly soluble model . to this end",
    "we neglect polariton effects,@xcite which will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] , and dephasing .",
    "we also neglect the dependence of the scattering amplitude on the light polarization because it is sensitive to the band structure , geometry , etc.@xcite excitons are considered stable particles without internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it is convenient to start with the bound exciton problem .",
    "the free induction signal from bound excitons can be found in the framework of the linear response approach .",
    "therefore , the specific spectral properties of the inflating antenna can be completely disentangled from nonlinear phenomena .",
