    "thanks to asymptotic freedom , fixed - order qcd perturbation theory can potentially provide accurate approximations to physical observables at suitably large energy scales , @xmath3 .",
    "such a perturbative description necessarily breaks down below the landau singularity at @xmath7 , and the infrared behaviour unavoidably involves non - perturbative effects .",
    "in fact non - perturbative information is needed even to make sense of perturbation theory , since higher perturbative coefficients exhibit factorial growth , and the perturbation series is not convergent . using a borel integral to represent the resummed perturbation series , the borel integral is ambiguous due to singularities on the integration contour along the positive real semi - axis in the borel plane , so - called infrared ( ir ) renormalons .",
    "these ambiguities are structurally the same as terms in the operator product expansion ( ope ) in powers of @xmath8 .",
    "ope ambiguities and borel representation ambiguities can compensate each other , allowing the perturbative borel and non - perturbative ope components to be separately well - defined once a regulation of the borel integral , such as principal value ( pv ) , has been chosen @xcite . for @xmath9 , however , the borel representation which is correlated with terms in the ope breaks down . in a recent paper ref.[2 ] , which focussed on the infrared freezing of the minkowskian @xmath10 ratio ,",
    "it was suggested that below @xmath1 one should use a modified borel representation whose ambiguities come from singularities lying on the integration contour along the negative real semi - axis , so - called ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalons .",
    "this borel representation has ambiguities which are structurally the same as a modified expansion in powers of @xmath11 , and once regulated both components can remain defined in the infrared . this change of borel representation has been claimed not to be physically motivated in ref.@xcite , where different conclusions about infrared behaviour are reached . in this paper",
    "we shall show that if we postulate a qcd skeleton expansion @xcite , then the leading one - chain term reproduces the standard borel representation for @xmath12 , and the proposed modified borel representation for @xmath9 .",
    "we consider the infrared behaviour of the one - chain result for some euclidean qcd observables .",
    "we shall concentrate on the adler-@xmath4 function , the gls sum rule and the polarised and unpolarised bjorken sum rules @xcite .",
    "the skeleton expansion result automatically freezes to zero as @xmath13 . for the observables we consider , the freezing to zero occurs after the borel resummed perturbative corrections to the parton model result change sign in the vicinity of @xmath1 .",
    "individual renormalon contributions to the borel integral diverge at @xmath1 , but we find that when all of the renormalons are summed over , one obtains a finite result .",
    "this finiteness requires relations between the residues of infrared and ultraviolet renormalons .",
    "only one of these relations has previously been noted @xcite , and we show that they arise from the continuity of the characteristic function in the skeleton expansion .",
    "considering the compensation of perturbative and ope ambiguities alluded to above , we are led to an expression for the @xmath3-dependence of the observable written in terms of the characteristic function , and containing a single undetermined non - perturbative parameter .",

    "we shall introduce the qcd skeleton expansion , and show that the one - chain leading term is equivalent to the standard borel representation for @xmath0 , and to the modified representation for @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss what can be learnt about the infrared freezing of observables . in section 3",
    "we describe the borel plane renormalon structure for our chosen euclidean observables , and we show that finiteness at @xmath7 only holds if there are cancellations between the residues of ir and uv renormalons , the cancellations rely on a previously unknown relation between the ir and uv residues .",
    "we write down a result for the @xmath3 dependence of the resummed observables in terms of exponential integral ( @xmath14 ) functions , and plot the infrared freezing behaviour to zero noted above . in section 4",
    "we consider the skeleton expansion for the adler @xmath4 function , and give an expression for the characteristic function of the leading one - chain term .",
    "making a power series expansion , and changing variables , we explicitly obtain the borel representations , and relate the ir and uv renormalon residues to the power series coefficients of the characteristic function .",

    "we derive the result for @xmath3-dependence including non - perturbative effects mentioned above . in section 6",
