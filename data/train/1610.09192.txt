    "[ fig : wellplot ] ? for large values of @xmath56 , the force may be seen as an interaction between a stationary dipole and a fluctuating one .",
    "this is corroborated by a direct computation of the force between a stationary dipole @xmath91 , pointing in the direction of the electric field , and a particle with hamiltonian @xmath92 where `` perpendicular '' and `` parallel '' refer to the direction of the @xmath43 field as before .",

    "substituting @xmath97 , the value at saturation , and @xmath98 ( using the leading term for large field from eq .  ) , we find @xmath99 this is identical to eq .  , except for a factor of two .",
    "this is expected , as this factor of two takes into account the force from the first fixed dipole interacting with the second fluctuating one and vice versa .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that eq .",
    "may be used to describe the behavior of the force for large values of @xmath43 .",
    "the importance of this observation lies in the statement , that such reasoning might be applicable more generally : in case of more complex behavior of @xmath100 , i.e. , more complex ( or realistic ) particles .",
    "we believe that the value of @xmath101 at saturation and the polarizability @xmath102 near saturation can be used to accurately predict the force in the limit of large external fields via eq .  .",
    "we have demonstrated how the classical casimir - polder force between two saturating dipoles can be suppressed by applying an external static electric field .",
    "of special interest is the angle @xmath35 between the external field and the vector connecting the dipoles , for which the deterministic dipole - dipole interaction vanishes .",
    "the remaining `` casimir - polder '' part can then be tuned and is arbitrarily suppressed at large values of external fields due to the vanishing polarizability .",
    "the force in that case decays with @xmath79 .",
    "this is in strong contrast to harmonic dipoles , which experience an increase of the force in the presence of an external field , growing with @xmath41 .",
    "we also provided a simple formula to estimate the force between particles under strong fields .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the results here to macroscopic objects composed of such dipole carrying particles , here multi - body effects will potentially change the physics for dense systems . however for dilute systems , where the pairwise approximation of van der waals forces is accurate , the results obtained here are directly applicable and thus the modulation of casimir or van der waals forces , predicted here will apply to a certain extent .",
    "of course an important main difference in more than two body systems is that the deterministic component of the interaction can not be obviously cancelled by a uniform electric field , as there is more than one center to center vector , denoted by @xmath9 in this paper , separating the interacting dipoles .",
