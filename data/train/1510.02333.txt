    "manipulation of heat at the microscopic level has been intensively studied in recent years .",
    "we can find several proposals of heat engines and/or heat pumps which consist of a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to multiple environments @xcite . in these works ,",
    "environmental effects have mainly been described using the formalism of the master equation in the well - known gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad ( gksl ) form @xcite , suitably in the context of full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite , where the dynamics is described by a semigroup therefore enabling only simplified exchanges of energy .",
    "such master equations have been proven to describe quite many physical open systems in the born - markov approximation , which , however , represents a restrictive requirement that often fails to provide an accurate description of the dynamics at short and intermediate time scales , especially in the presence of a structured environment @xcite .",
    "therefore , the importance of considering generalized master equations with time - dependent coefficients , also spurred by the recent developments of quantum technologies in short - time and/or low - temperature regions @xcite , has became a leitmotif in this field @xcite . within this more realistic framework , however , a non - markovian description of the dynamics is necessary in order to correctly characterize the system . due to this fact , much effort has been devoted in the last decade to formally define and quantify the degree of non - markovianity of a given dynamics @xcite , as well as developing reservoir - engineering techniques to manipulate it @xcite .",
    "one of the most active research areas in this field is nowadays dedicated to the challenge of exploiting non - markovianity as a resource to improve , for example , quantum communication protocols @xcite .",
    "our work is inserted in this framework and in particular focuses on the study of the energy flow between a system of interest and its environment , quantified through fcs methods , without using the full born - markov approximation and only assuming a second - order time - convolutionless expansion of the generator of the dynamics , that is working in the born approximation . in this scenario , at variance with what happens in the ( semigroup ) regime , where a one - way - only energy current can occur , non - markovian dynamical effects generally arise and the rate by which system and environment exchange energy can oscillate in time and energy can even come back from the environment to the system . in order to capture this phenomenon , we introduce a condition and a suitable quantifier of the energy backflow .",
    "we then illustrate this scenario considering a spin - boson model , which provides a paradigm in the description of dissipative two - level systems and has found wide applicability in many important situations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . finally , we study the connection between the introduced quantifier for the energy backflow and the occurrence of non - markovianity as introduced by breuer , laine , and piilo in @xcite .",

    "consider a system of interest interacting with its environment according to the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the sum of the system hamiltonian @xmath2 and of the environmental hamiltonian @xmath3 , while @xmath4 is the interaction hamiltonian . within this framework ,",
    "the time evolution of an environmental observable @xmath5 which is transferred from the relevant system into the environment ( or vice versa ) is reconstructed by looking at the difference in the outcomes of two - point projective measurement .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote such outcomes , respectively , at the initial time @xmath8 and at a later time @xmath9 , of the measurement of the environmental observable @xmath5 .",

    "the information on the variation of the observable @xmath5 is then encapsulated in the probability density @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 stands for the dirac @xmath16 distribution . introducing the cumulant - generating function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is often referred to as the counting field ,",
    "the cumulant of the probability distribution @xmath19 is then readily given by the derivative of @xmath20 : @xmath21 this procedure can be directly applied in the context of open quantum systems as follows .",
    "if we assume that @xmath22=0 $ ] and moreover use the fact that , if the spectral decomposition of @xmath5 is @xmath23 , then @xmath24 holds for any function @xmath25 , we readily obtain the following relation : @xmath26 by means of it , it is straightforward to prove that the cumulant - generating function can be written as @xmath27 where we have introduced the conditional density operator @xmath28 which evolves according to the modified evolution operator @xmath29 obviously , for @xmath30 we retrieve the usual evolution operator @xmath31 and the statistical operator @xmath32",
    ".      let us apply the fcs formalism to the study of energy transfer between a system and its environment . to this aim",
    "we select the observable @xmath5 as the environmental energy , i.e. , @xmath33 , whose spectrum we assume to be time - independent since no external driving fields are considered . in the absence of initial correlations between the system of interest and its environment , i.e. , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being a gibbs state relative to the temperature @xmath36 , the evolution of the modified operator @xmath37 is given in terms of the time - convolutionless generalized master equation ( gme ) @xcite @xmath38 where the time - dependent superoperator @xmath39 in the second - order approximation has the form @xmath40 = { \\textcolor{black}{-i}}\\left[{\\mathcal{h}}_s,\\omega\\right]\\notag\\\\ & - \\int_0^t \\ , d\\tau \\,\\mathrm{tr}_{e }   \\left[{{\\mathcal{h}}_{int}},\\,\\left[{{\\mathcal{h}}_{int}}(-\\tau),\\,\\omega\\otimes\\rho_e(0)\\right]_{\\chi}\\right]_{\\chi } \\ ] ] where @xmath41_{\\chi } \\equiv { \\textcolor{black}{{\\mathcal{h}}_{int}^{\\chi}(t)}}b - b { \\textcolor{black}{{\\mathcal{h}}_{int}^{-\\chi}(t)}}$ ] , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "the time - dependent first moment of the energy transfer can be consequently expressed , using , as @xcite where @xmath50 denotes the trace operation in hilbert - schmidt space . since the density operator satisfies the relation @xmath51 , the state @xmath50 is a left eigenstate of @xmath48 relative to the zero eigenvalue . using this relation , eq .",
    "can be expressed in the more compact form @xmath52 where we have introduced the function which describes the energy flow per unit of time , i.e. , the rate of energy between the system of interest and its environment .    in the remainder of the paper @xmath53",
    "will be the crucial quantity under investigation .",
    "the rate by which the system and its environment exchange energy may , depending on the several parameters characterizing the dynamics .",
    "in particular , adopting the terminology from the context of non - markovian dynamics @xcite , we speak of regions of _ energy backflow _ from the environment to the system whenever , considering situations which in the born - markov semigroup approximation would lead to a non - negative steady energy transfer from system to environment , we have that at some time @xmath9 building on this condition , a measure for the total amount of energy which has flown back from the environment to the system during the evolution is naturally introduced as @xmath54 where the maximization procedure is performed over all possible initial states of the reduced system .",
    "note that the integrand of is different from zero if and only if @xmath53 assumes negative values .",
    "moreover , it represents , in principle , a measurable quantity .",
    "however , despite the formal similarity between this quantifier and some of the recently introduced non - markovianity measures @xcite , it should not be confused with an alternative non - markovianity measure , rather providing only an estimate of the energy backflow .",
    "in the present section we study the energy transfer in the so - called spin - boson model .",
    "this model , which describes a spin-@xmath55 system interacting with an environment consisting of an infinite number of bosonic modes , has been studied extensively over the past decades since it represents the prototypical model of dissipative two - level system @xcite .",
    "let us start from the hamiltonian of the composite system , which reads with @xmath56 where @xmath57 denote the usual pauli matrices , @xmath58 is the energy difference between excited ( @xmath59 ) and ground ( @xmath60 ) state of the system , .",

    ".    a crucial role in the definition of @xmath72 is played by the spectral density @xmath73 , which describes both the distribution of bath modes and their interaction strength with the system . in the limit of a continuous distribution of environmental modes",
    "the spectral density can be described by a smooth function which we take of the form @xmath74 which shows an ohmic behavior at low frequencies , a linear dependence on the coupling strength @xmath75 , and finally an exponential cutoff part .",

    "however , it is interesting to look in more detail at the contributions appearing in eq . .",
    "building on the results detailed in appendix [ app : appb ] , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "can be reexpressed in the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 having introduced the difference in the system s populations @xmath88 . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "in fact just corresponds to the time derivative of the change in the system s energy , since it is proportional through the fundamental system energy @xmath58 ( we remind that @xmath44 ) to the fraction of the system s population that moves to the ground state .",
    "the second term , @xmath89 , is instead a combination of elementary oscillating functions and environmental kernels : the is driven by the noise kernel @xmath90 and also depends on the solution for the ground - state population of the system @xmath91 , at variance with the which is proportional only to the dissipation kernel , therefore also being independent of the temperature of the bath",
    ".    the integral form of can also be considered @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "equation shows that the variation in the environmental energy , obtained in this case as the fcs mean @xmath94 , is given by the sum of two distinct contributions .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to the variation of the reduced system s energy , but there is an additional contribution which depends both on the detailed structure of the environment , and on the coupling between system and environment through the dissipation and noise . in the long - time limit , which corresponds to the born - markov approximation , this additional contribution vanishes since @xmath89 goes to zero according to the behavior of both dissipation and noise kernel as given by ; see appendix [ app : appa ] for details .      in this section",
    "we illustrate and discuss the results of the numerical evaluation of the measure of energy for different values of the relevant parameters .    in the remainder of the work we consider the following form for the initial state of the reduced system @xmath95 which is a gibbs state with an effective temperature @xmath96 , here chosen to be greater than or equal to the environmental one .",
    "indeed , in order to study the flow of energy from the environment back to the system , we are interested in situations which in the born - markov approximation , corresponding to a semigroup description , would lead to a steady energy transfer from system to environment .",
    "this situation corresponds to setting @xmath97 , so that in this case one can properly speak of energy backflow .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of the ground - state population @xmath91 * ( a ) * and the energy flow per unit of time @xmath53 * ( b ) * in the weak - coupling limit @xmath98 and in units of @xmath58 , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and different values of the environmental temperature @xmath101 .",

    "the markedly different behaviors of solid and dashed lines in short and intermediate time , however , neatly show the inadequacy of born - markov approximation apart from the long - time limit case .",
    "moreover , it can be noticed from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] * ( b ) * how the value of the first local minimum of @xmath53 decreases for decreasing values of the difference @xmath105 , attaining its lowest value for @xmath106 .",
    "strong numerical evidences suggest that this trend is maintained for all values of the relevant parameters @xmath107 , thus making it possible to conclude that energy backflow [ i.e. , the area of the negative region of @xmath53 ] is maximized by the choice of having initial system and environment at the same temperature , we note that the choice for the class of initial system s states does not affect the validity of this result .",
    "in fact , since the equations of motion for the coherences and populations are decoupled from each other and since the coherences do not enter the expression of @xmath53 , any initial state with nonzero coherence is equivalent for this purpose to a diagonal state , which can always be recast in a gibbs form relative to an effective temperature @xmath96 .",

    "in the present section we discuss in detail the connection between our thermodynamic quantity , namely the energy ( back-)flow between a reduced system and its environment , obtained in fcs formalism , and the concept of non - markovianity . among the different criteria and measures introduced so far to define and quantify non - markovianity @xcite",
    ", we concentrate our attention to the one introduced by breuer , laine , and piilo @xcite , which has also been experimentally measured in all - optical settings @xcite . the reason for this choice is the physical interpretation behind it , which we briefly recall . according to @xcite , any change in the distinguishability between two reduced states",
    "can be read in terms of an information flow between system and environment .",
    "such distinguishability is quantified through the trace distance @xcite , which is a metric on the space of states induced by the trace norm and has the property to be a contraction under the action of completely positive and trace - preserving maps ( i.e. , physically implementable channels ) .",
    "the evolution of the trace distance between two states of the reduced system coupled to the same environment but evolved from different initial conditions , which we denote with @xmath124 describes the information exchange between the system and its environment .",
    "in particular , a decrease of indicates a ability to discriminate between the two initial conditions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , this in turn meaning that some information has flown out of the system towards the environment .",
    "analogously , a temporary increase of the trace distance can be ascribed to a backflow of information from the environment to the system again .",
    "non - markovian quantum dynamics are accordingly defined as those which show a non - monotonic behavior of the trace distance , i.e. such that there exist time intervals where @xmath127 building on this definition , the non - markovianity measure introduced in @xcite is just the sum of the trace - distance regrowths , conveniently maximized over all possible couples of initial states of the system : @xmath128 this measure of non - markovianity has already been calculated for the spin - boson model in @xcite , where it turned out to be a function of the temperature of the environment @xmath36 and of the cut - off frequency @xmath113 .",
    "we will comment in more detail about this in a short while .",
    "let us proceed to discuss the connection between the occurrence of non - markovianity and of energy backflow , the latter being witnessed by the time behavior of @xmath53 according to .",
    "first of all , we have already shown that in the born - markov approximation the energy flow per unit of time becomes a positive nonoscillating function ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] * ( b ) * and eqs . and .",
    "this physically corresponds to the case of a system which , i.e. , a monotonic unidirectional flow of energy pointed towards the environment .",
    "moreover , since such limiting dynamics corresponds to a quantum dynamical semigroup , i.e. , the master equation reduces to gksl form @xcite , the non - markovianity measure vanishes .",
    "more strongly , semigroup dynamics actually represents a markovian dynamics for every criterion so far introduced , apart from this limiting case the function @xmath53 has been proven to oscillate in time for every value of the relevant parameters , namely cutoff frequency , as well as temperatures of the bath and of the system and coupling strength ( always within weak - coupling regime that allows the second - order time - convolutionless expansion of the gme ) .",
    "such oscillations reflect the time behavior of the rate by which the system loses its energy in favor of the environment : if @xmath53 remains positive , then the energy flow still remains unidirectionally pointed from the system towards the environment .",
    "if , however , for certain values of the parameters , @xmath53 temporarily takes on negative values , then energy backflow occurs .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the non - markovianity measure for the spin - boson model has already been evaluated for this model @xcite , where the calculations have been carried out for a slightly different choice of the spectral density @xmath129 . in @xcite , in fact , the authors employed a lorentzian cutoff instead of an exponential one [ see our eq . and their eq . ( 19 ) ] ; we have reevaluated such measure @xmath130 with the current spectral density and the result has turned out to be substantially unchanged , this confirming the suggestion that the information backflow does not significantly depend on the high - frequency part of the spectrum @xcite , at least in the case of a bosonic bath . therefore , in order to avoid redundancy , we limit ourselves to recall here the most significant features of this measure , referring to appendix [ app : nm ] for the plot of @xmath130 .",
    "first , for large values of the cutoff frequency the spectral density can be approximated with @xmath131 , this leading to a markovian dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , for decreasing values of the cutoff frequency @xmath113 the amount of non - markovianity , in general , increases , the only exception being represented by the region of parameters in which the resonance condition holds .",
    "such condition expresses the requirement of local flatness of the effective spectral density around the system s transition frequency , and describes a curve in the @xmath132 plane called resonance curve along which a predominantly markovian regime is expected and found @xcite . in the case here",
    "considered of exponential cutoff , the resonance curve , which reads @xmath133 continues to retrace well the observed markovian region at low temperatures of the bath ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nm ] in appendix [ app : nm ] ) .",
    "a comparison between figs . [ fig : ebf ] and [ fig : nm ] clearly shows that are connected to each other .",
    "first of all , in fact , for every value of the cutoff frequency @xmath113 , both quantities increase with increasing values of the temperature , this being related to the fact that in this model , when @xmath36 grows , the lower frequency part of the effective spectrum @xmath117 is enhanced . moreover , both the non - markovianity generally increase for decreasing values of the cutoff frequency .",
    "this is due to the fact that the correlation time of the noise kernel reduces for growing values of @xmath113 , so that the correlation function of the bath is almost @xmath16 correlated in time , which leads to a semigroup ( and therefore markovian ) dynamics . finally , as already highlighted in sec .",
    "[ sec : sb ] a , both quantities are strongly related to the resonance condition . in particular , while the non - markovianity measure vanishes only when holds strictly , the energy backflow is suppressed even when is approximately satisfied .",
    "this result , together with the one discussed above in the born - markov regime , makes it possible to conclude that in a markovian regime energy backflow is suppressed .",
    "the opposite is , however , in general , not true ; namely , the absence of energy backflow does not imply absence of information backflow ,    the occurrence of energy backflow , in conclusion , as a stricter condition than non - markovianity . on the other hand , however , for values of the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath36 for which the amount of non - markovianity is significant , it becomes possible to measure a backflow of energy , as witnessed by the colored region in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebf ] .",
    "the connection we have found between non - markovianity and energy backflow measures can represent a powerful hint in relation to the practical usefulness of non - markovianity : it is , in fact , clear from this result that a convenient engineering of the reservoir such to achieve non - markovianity @xcite allows to have energy backflow and therefore to treat the environment as a potential quantum energy buffer .",
    "using formalism , we have studied the mean value of the energy exchange between a system of interest and its environment in the framework of the second - order time - convolutionless gme , introducing a suitable condition and quantifier for the occurrence of energy backflow from the environment back to the system .",
    "we have then applied this construction to the spin - boson model , where we also showed how the first moment of the energy increment in the environment does not correspond only to the amount of energy lost by the system in the short and intermediate time scale , but has an additional oscillating contribution which reflects the quantum - mechanical feature of the interaction .",
    "such deviation has been proven to vanish in the long - time limit , where the born - markov approximated solution faithfully describes the dynamics , given in terms of a semigroup . moreover , choosing an ohmic spectral density with exponential cutoff to describe the distribution of bath modes and their interaction with the two - level system , we have studied the time behavior of the energy flow as a function of the many relevant parameters of the model , such as the environmental and effective system s temperatures , the cutoff frequency , and the coupling strength .",
    "results have shown that , for certain values of these parameters , the energy which has flown from the two - level system to the environment can effectively come back .",
    "we point out that , while in this work we focused on the first cumulant of the exchanged energy , higher - order cumulants can also be considered using the fcs formalism @xcite , making it possible to discuss , for example , bunching properties of bosons in the presence of energy backflow .",
    "we have finally considered an important criterion of non - markovianity , namely the one based on the time behavior of the trace distance between two distinct initial states , and connected it , . the comparative analysis has shown that non - markovianity allows for the observation of energy backflow .",
    "our quantifier of energy backflow might also have interesting applications in the context of quantum thermodynamics of open quantum systems @xcite , also in the connection with non - markovianity , a topic recently attracting much attention @xcite , as well as in the study of environment - induced entanglement @xcite .",

    "as written in the main body of the paper , if we simply set the counting field parameter @xmath30 , we obtain the usual master equation for the statistical operator of the reduced system @xmath134 .",
    "in particular , it is clear from that the dynamics of the coherences is decoupled from the one of the populations , and therefore only the evolution of the latter determines the behavior of eq . .",

    "the differential equation for the ground - state population becomes @xmath157 whose solution reads @xmath158 using we can also finally compute the expression of the long - time limit version of the energy flux per unit of time @xmath159 .",
