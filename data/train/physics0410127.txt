    "general statistical mechanics considerations indicate that for a system to behave according the thermodynamics it must be properly coupled to the heat bath .",

    "the dilation theory was the first rather general approach to the construction of a spectral theory for dissipative operators .",

    "so the relation ( [ zp1 ] ) provides an interesting scenario within the lax - phillips scattering theory for the rise of a dissipative operator .",
    "the dilation theory yields the spectral theory through the construction of generalized eigenmodes ( the scattering theory ) provided , of course , the conditions discussed above are satisfied .",
    "looking at the dilation theory from the point of view of open ( dispersive and dissipative ) systems , one can ask if the theory allows to find the unitary group @xmath142 or , equivalently , the self - adjoint operator @xmath143 being given the dissipative operator @xmath153 ?",
    "the answer is positive for rather large class of dissipative operators @xmath153 .",

    "* theorem 3 ) .",
    "hence when the dilation theory applies it provides a solid foundation for spectral studies .",
    "unfortunately , the dilation theory does not apply to many important physical problems simply because its initial assumptions on the nature of the dissipation are too restrictive . for systems described by evolution equations ( [ hpq4a])-([hpq5 ] )",
    "the dissipation always comes with the dispersion , and the dilation theory does not apply .",
    "indeed , the most general form for a linear causal time - homogeneous _ open system _ , as analyzed in @xcite , is @xmath160where @xmath161 is a hilbert space , @xmath162 and @xmath143 are self - adjoint operators in @xmath161 , @xmath163 is an external force and @xmath164 is the _ friction function _ ,",
    "subject to a power dissipation condition@xmath165_only in the very special case of ( [ os1 ] ) when the friction is instantaneous ( markovian ) , i.e. _ @xmath166 _ _ , can one use the dilation theory as in pav2__. for many well studied dielectric media , such as lorentz or debye , not to mention media with generic frequency dependent electric susceptibilities , the relevant friction functions are not instantaneous . for such systems one must use a more general approach , such as developed in @xcite and extended here and in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out , however , that coupling to a canonical heat bath ( [ hhb1 ] ) may be interpreted , as in the lamb model , as  attaching an elastic string \" at any point of loss .",
    "the attached strings are analogous to the scattering channels of the dilation theory , with the only difference being that our  strings \" are coupled in more general ways than in the dilation theory .",
