    "since the work of poincar and birkhoff the notion of global surface of section has been used as an effective tool in finding periodic motions of hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom , see  @xcite .",
    "a global section of annulus - type on an energy level implies the existence of many closed orbits by the celebrated poincar - birkhoff theorem  @xcite if the associated return map satisfies a twist - condition .",
    "our goal is to describe a non - resonance condition for reeb flows on the tight 3-sphere which implies the existence of infinitely many closed orbits , and generalizes the twist - condition on the poincar - birkhoff theorem to cases where a global surface of section might not be available .",
    "we assume instead that there is a pair of periodic orbits forming a hopf link .",
    "the infinitesimal flow about the two components defines rotation numbers and , as we shall see , if these numbers do not satisfy a precise resonance condition then infinitely many closed orbits exist and are distinguished by their homotopy classes in the complement of the hopf link .",
    "this lack of resonance can be seen as a twist - condition : one finds a non - empty open twist interval such that there is a closed orbit associated to every rational point in its interior .    in the presence of a disk - like global surface of section for the flow  for example",
    "when the contact form is dynamically convex as in  @xcite  an orbit corresponding to a fixed point of the return map together with the boundary of the global section constitute a hopf link .",
    "the return map restricted to the open annulus obtained by removing this fixed point is well - defined .",
    "in this case , the lack of resonance mentioned above is a twist - condition , and our result can be reduced to the poincar - birkhoff theorem , or rather to a generalization due to franks  @xcite .",
    "we will explain this analogy more thoroughly in section  [ sec - intro_interpretation ] .",
    "there are examples of hopf links and reeb flows as above where both components of the link do not bound a disk - like global section . in this case",
    "a two - dimensional reduction is not available . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we use a different approach in place of the theory of global surfaces of section which is of a variational nature .",
    "the idea is to consider the homology of the abstract conley index of a sufficiently large isolating block for the gradient flow of the action functional , as angenent did in  @xcite for the energy .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite shows that properties of the curve - shortening flow are sufficient in order to define a conley index associated to a so - called flat knot , which in special cases can be used to deduce existence results for closed geodesics on the 2-sphere .",
    "we shall consider instead cylindrical contact homology on the complement of the hopf link . in this sense , the results are analogous to those of  @xcite , but in the more general setting of reeb flows on the tight 3-sphere .",

    "we define the transverse rotation number @xmath35 of a closed reeb orbit @xmath36 by looking at the rate at which the transverse linearized flow rotates around @xmath36 , measured with respect to coordinates on the contact structure induced by a global positive frame .",
