    "the trace norm and induced trace distance play an important role in quantum information theory .",
    "one of its most important features , widely used in research papers and popular textbooks  @xcite , is its contractivity for trace - preserving quantum evolution , first proved by ruskai  @xcite .",
    "it was once conjectured that contractivity would extend to other more intuitive norms such that the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) norm  @xcite , but flaws in the original argument were soon discovered and an explicit counter - example of a trace - preserving map with non - contractive hs norm was provided by ozawa  @xcite .",
    "the more general question of when a positive trace - preserving [ ptp ] map between matrix spaces is contractive with respect to the @xmath2-norm for @xmath3 was recently considered in  @xcite , where it was shown that ptp maps are contractive for @xmath3 in general if only if they are unital .",
    "this does not answer the question , however , when a ptp map defined on a subset of a matrix space is contractive with respect to a particular @xmath2-norm such as the hs norm , and contractivity depends on the subspace .",
    "in particular , the hs norm restricted to the trace - zero hyperplane in the space of hermitian matrices may be contractive while it is not on the whole matrix space .",
    "contractivity of the distance between quantum states in the sense that the distance between two quantum states is monotonically decreasing , is of particular interest in the area of open system dynamics .",
    "we consider under what conditions the evolution of an open quantum system subject to semigroup dynamics governed by a lindblad master equation is contractive with respect to the hs distance .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath1 both the hs norm and distance are always contractive , while for @xmath0 both are contractive only for small subsets of open systems , with the set of open systems for which the hs norm is contractive being strictly smaller than the set of open systems for which the hs distance is contractive . aside from the relevance to quantum information , e.g. , in the construction of entanglement measures , one important implication of the non - contractivity of the hs norm is in quantum control , where the hs distance between quantum trajectories is a common choice of a lyapunov function , e.g. , for local optimal control  @xcite .",
    "as monotonicity is a prerequisite for a lyapunov function , it means that the hs distance is generally not a suitable candidate for a lyapunov function for open systems .",
    "let @xmath4 be a hilbert space with @xmath5 and let @xmath6 $ ] be the bounded operators on @xmath4 , and @xmath7 $ ] be the trace-@xmath8 positive operators on @xmath4 .",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath9 is well - defined for any @xmath10 $ ] as @xmath11 is positive , and satisfies the axioms of a norm , and induces a metric , the trace distance , in the usual way @xmath12 .    among the nice features of the trace norm",
    "is contractivity under trace - preserving maps  @xcite , i.e. , given two density operators @xmath13 $ ] and a map @xmath14\\to\\bb[\\h]$ ] with @xmath15 , then @xmath16 this implies in particular that any ( super)operator that maps density matrices to density matrices can not increase the trace distance between two states .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath17 is a quantum dynamical semi - group then @xmath18 is monotonically decreasing , although monotonicity is not always strict .",
    "indeed , in the special case of unitary evolution the trace distance remains constant , @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "one drawback of the trace distance , however , is that it is not the most intuitive distance measure for quantum states .",
    "a more natural choice is the hilbert schmidt ( hs ) distance @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the norm induced by the hs inner product @xmath23 for hermitian operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 the hs inner product and distance simplify to @xmath26 and @xmath27}.\\ ] ] if we choose an orthonormal basis @xmath28 for the hermitian operators on @xmath4 then the coordinate vector @xmath29 with @xmath30 for any hermitian operator @xmath31 on @xmath4 is a vector in @xmath32 , and noting that @xmath33 by orthonormality , shows that the hs inner product reduces to the standard euclidean inner product in @xmath32 @xmath34 if we choose an orthonormal basis with the last basis vector @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the identity on @xmath4 , then all hermitian operators with constant trace @xmath37 correspond to hyperplanes in @xmath32 with @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , if we are only interested in hermitian operators with constant trace , such as the class of density operators on @xmath4 , it suffices to consider the reduced coordinate vector @xmath39 and @xmath40 furthermore , if @xmath41 are two hermitian operators with @xmath42 then @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 i.e. , the hs distance between two hermitian operators of the same trace class , is simply the euclidean distance of their associated reduced ( real ) coordinate vectors , which generalize the bloch vector for @xmath1 .",
    "this equivalence of hs distance between density operators and the euclidean distance between their reduced coordinate vectors makes the hs distance a very intuitive and useful distance measure .",
    "for @xmath1 , i.e. , a single qubit , it is easy to show that the trace and hs distance agree up to a constant factor , and hence contractivity of one implies contractivity of the other .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath46 be two qubit density operators and let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be their respective coordinate vectors in @xmath49 with respect to the ( orthonormal ) basis @xmath50 defined above .",
    "then @xmath51 for @xmath52 and setting @xmath53 @xmath54 choosing @xmath55 to be , e.g. , the standard ( normalized ) pauli basis , it is easy to verify that the eigenvalues of @xmath56 are @xmath57 , and noting that for hermitian matrices @xmath58 is the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of @xmath31 , we have   instead , but using an orthonormal basis the bloch sphere for a single qubit has radius @xmath59 instead of @xmath8 , whence we only a factor of @xmath59 . ] @xmath60 hence , the hs distance for a single qubit is monotonically decreasing under completely positive maps and quantum semigroup dynamics",
    ". this argument does not generalize , however , as the relationship between the eigenvalues of a positive map and the euclidean norm of the coordinate vector that was used is very specific to @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath0 we still have @xmath61 from basic functional analysis  @xcite .",
    "thus the trace norm provides an upper bound on the hilbert - schmidt norm . applied to open quantum systems subject to semi - group dynamics governed by a lindblad master equation @xmath62 + \\l_d\\rho(t),\\ ] ] with @xmath63\\rho(t)$ ] ,",
