    "quantifying defects in graphene related systems , which include a large family of @xmath2 carbon structures , is crucial both to gain insight in their fundamental properties , and for applications . in graphene , this is a key step towards the understanding of the limits to its ultimate mobility@xcite .",
    "large efforts have been devoted to quantify defects and disorder using raman spectroscopy for nanographites@xcite , amorphous carbons@xcite , carbon nanotubes@xcite , and graphene@xcite .",
    "the first attempt was the pioneering work of tuinstra and koenig ( tk)@xcite .",
    "they reported the raman spectrum of graphite and nano - crystalline graphite , and assigned the mode at @xmath11580@xmath3 to the high frequency @xmath4 raman allowed optical phonon , now known as g peak@xcite . in defected and nanocrystalline samples they measured a second peak at @xmath11350@xmath3 , now known as d peak@xcite .",
    "they assigned it to an @xmath5 breathing mode at the brillouin zone ( bz ) boundary * k * , activated by the relaxation of the raman fundamental selection rule @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the phonon wavevector@xcite .",
    "they noted that the ratio of the d to g intensities varied inversely with the crystallite size , @xmath8 .",
    "ref.@xcite noted the failure of the tk relation for high defect densities , and proposed a more complete amorphization trajectory valid to date .",
    "refs.@xcite reported a significant excitation energy dependence of the intensity ratio .",
    "refs.@xcite measured this excitation laser energy dependency in the raman spectra of nanographites , and the ratio between the d and g bands was shown to depend on the fourth power of the excitation laser energy @xmath9 .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental geometric difference between defects related to the size of a nano - crystallite and point defects in the @xmath2 carbon lattices , resulting in a different intensity ratio dependence on the amount of disorder .",
    "basically , the amount of disorder in a nano - crystallite is given by the amount of border ( one - dimensional defects ) with respect to the total crystallite area , and this is a measure of the nano - crystallite size @xmath8 . in graphene with zero - dimensional point - like defects ,",
    "the distance between defects , @xmath10 , is a measure of the amount of disorder , and recent experiments show that different approaches must be used to quantify @xmath10 and @xmath8 by raman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath10 on peak width , frequency , intensity , and integrated area for many raman peaks in single layer graphene was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and extended to n - layer graphene in ref .",
    "@xcite , all using a single laser line @xmath11ev .    here ,",
    "to fully accomplish the protocol for quantifying point - like defects in graphene using raman spectroscopy ( or equivalently , @xmath10 ) , we use different excitation laser lines in ion - bombarded samples and measure the d to g peak intensity ratio .",
    "this ratio is denoted in literature as @xmath12 or i(d)/i(g ) , while the ratio of their areas , i.e. frequency integrated intensity , as @xmath13 or a(d)/a(g ) . in principle , for small disorder or perturbations , one should always consider the area ratio , since the area under each peak represents the probability of the whole process , considering uncertainty  @xcite . however , for large disorder , it is far more informative to decouple the information on peak intensity and full width at half maximum .",
    "the latter , denoted in literature as fwhm or @xmath14 , is a measure of structural disorder@xcite , while the intensity represents the phonon modes / molecular vibrations involved in the most resonant raman processes  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we will consider the decoupled @xmath12 and peak widths trends .",
    "we find that , for a given @xmath10 , @xmath12 increases as the excitation laser energy increases .",
    "we present a set of empirical formulas that can be used to quantify the amount of point - like defects in graphene samples with @xmath1510 nm using any excitation laser energy / wavelength in the visible range .",
    "the analysis of the d and g peak widths and their dispersions with excitation energy unambiguously discriminate between the two main stages of disordering incurred by such samples .",
    "we produce single layer graphene ( slg ) samples with increasing defect density by mechanical exfoliation followed by ar@xmath0-bombardment , as for the procedure outlined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the ion - bombardment experiments are carried out in an omicron vt - stm ultra - high vacuum system ( base pressure 5@xmath1610@xmath17 mbar ) equipped with an ise 5 ion source .",
    "raman spectra are measured at room temperature with a renishaw micro - spectrometer .",
    "the spot size is @xmath11@xmath18 m for a 100@xmath16 objective , and the power is kept at @xmath11.0mw to avoid heating .",
    "the excitation energies , @xmath9 , ( wavelengths , @xmath19 ) are : ti - sapph 1.58ev ( 785 nm ) , he - ne 1.96ev ( 632.8 nm ) , ar@xmath20 2.41ev ( 514.5 nm ) .    2.41ev ( @xmath21514.5 nm ) .",

    "[ f01 ] are taken at @xmath272.41ev ( @xmath21514.5 nm ) .",
    "the raman spectra in figure  [ f01 ] consist of a set of distinct peaks .",
    "the g and d appear around 1580@xmath3 and 1350@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the g peak corresponds to the @xmath4 phonon at the brillouin zone center .",
    "the d peak is due to the breathing modes of six - atom rings and requires a defect for its activation  @xcite .",
    "it comes from transverse optical ( to ) phonons around the * k * or * k@xmath22 * points in the @xmath28 brillouin zone  @xcite , involves an intervalley double resonance process  @xcite , and is strongly dispersive  @xcite with excitation energy due to a kohn anomaly at * * k**@xcite .",
    "double resonance can also happen as intravalley process , i.  e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around * k * or * k@xmath22 *  @xcite .",
    "this gives the so - called d@xmath22 peak , which is centered at @xmath29@xmath3 in defected samples measured at 514.5nm@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak ( also called g@xmath22 in the literature ) is the second order of the d peak  @xcite .",
    "this is a single peak in single layer graphene , whereas it splits in four in bilayer graphene , reflecting the evolution of the electron band structure  @xcite .",
    "the 2d@xmath22 peak ( also called g@xmath30 in analogy to g@xmath22 ) is the second order of d@xmath22 . since 2d(g@xmath22 ) and 2d@xmath22(g@xmath30 ) originate from a process where momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors , no defects are required for their activation , and are thus always present . on the other hand , the d+d@xmath22 band ( @xmath12940@xmath3 ) is the combination of phonons with different momenta , around * k * and @xmath14 , thus requires a defect for its activation .    ref .",

    "1 and 2 are the most relevant and are summarized here .    in stage 1",

    ", the raman spectrum evolves as follows  @xcite : a ) the g peak position , denoted in literature as pos(g ) or @xmath32 , decreases from @xmath11600@xmath3 towards @xmath11510@xmath3 ; b ) the tk relation fails and @xmath12 decreases towards 0 ; c ) @xmath32 becomes dispersive with the excitation laser energy , the dispersion increasing with disorder ; d ) there are no more well defined second - order peaks , but a small modulated bump from @xmath12300@xmath3 to @xmath13200@xmath3  @xcite .    in disordered carbons @xmath32 increases as the excitation wavelength decreases , from ir to uv  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion rate , disp(g)=@xmath33 , increases with disorder .",
    "the g dispersion separates the materials into two types . in those with only @xmath2 rings , disp(g ) saturates at @xmath11600@xmath3 , the g position at the end of stage 1 .",
    "in contrast , for those containing @xmath2 chains ( such as in amorphous and diamond - like carbons ) , g continues to rise past 1600@xmath3 and can reach @xmath11690@xmath3 for 229 nm excitation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "d always disperses with excitation energy  @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 always increases with disorder@xcite .",
    "thus , combining @xmath12 and @xmath34 allows to discriminate between stages 1 or 2 , since samples in stage 1 and 2 could have the same @xmath12 , but not the same @xmath34 , being this much bigger in stage 2@xcite .",
    "we note that figure  [ f01 ] shows the loss of sharp second order features in the raman spectrum obtained from the @xmath10=2 nm slg .",
    "this is an evidence that the range of defect densities in our study covers stage 1 ( samples with @xmath10=24,14,13,7,5 nm ) and the onset of stage 2 ( sample with @xmath10=2 nm )",
    ".        figures  [ f02]a - c report the first - order raman spectra of our ion - bombarded slgs measured at @xmath271.58ev ( @xmath21785 nm ) , 1.96ev ( 632.8nm),2.41ev ( 514.5 nm ) , respectively .",
    "figure  [ f02]d shows the raman spectra of the ion - bombarded slg with @xmath10=7 nm obtained using the three different laser energies .",
    "we note that @xmath12 considerably changes with the excitation energy .",
    "this is a well - know effect in the raman scattering of @xmath2 carbons@xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that the integrated areas of different peaks depend differently on excitation energy @xmath9 : while @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 shown no @xmath9-dependence , @xmath38 was found to be proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the independence of @xmath37 on @xmath9 agrees with the theoretical prediction  @xcite if one assumes that the electronic scattering rate is proportional to the energy .",
    "however , a fully quantitative theory is not trivial since , in general , @xmath35 depends not only on the concentration of defects , but on their type as well ( e.g. , only defects able to scatter electrons between the two valleys can contribute )  @xcite .",
    "different defects can also produce different frequency and polarization dependence of @xmath35  @xcite .     for all samples and laser energies considered here .",

    "the solid curve is given by @xmath44.[f03],width=377 ]    figure  [ f03 ] plots @xmath12 for all slgs and laser energies .",
    "for all @xmath9 , @xmath12 increases as @xmath10 decreases ( stage 1 ) , reaches a maximum at @xmath10@xmath13 nm , and decreases towards zero for @xmath10@xmath453 nm ( stage 2 ) .",
    "it is important to understand what the maximum of @xmath12 vs. @xmath10 means .",
    "@xmath46 will keep increasing until the contribution from each defect sums independently  @xcite . in this regime ( stage 1 )",
    "@xmath46 is proportional to the total number of defects probed by the laser spot . for an average defect distance @xmath10 and laser spot size @xmath47 , there are on average @xmath48 defects in the area probed by the laser , thus @xmath46@xmath49 . on the other hand , @xmath50 is proportional to the total area probed by the laser@xmath51 , giving @xmath12@xmath52  @xcite .",
    "however , if two defects are closer than the average distance an e - h pair travels before scattering with a phonon , then their contributions will not sum independently anymore  @xcite .",
    "this distance can be estimated as @xmath533 nm  @xcite , where @xmath54 m/s is the fermi velocity around the * k * and * k@xmath22 * points , in excellent agreement with the predictions of refs.@xcite and the data of refs.@xcite . for an increasing number of defects ( stage 2 ) , where @xmath10@xmath453 nm , @xmath55 domains become smaller and the rings fewer and more distorted , until they open up . as the g peak is just related to the relative motion of @xmath55 carbons",
    ", we can assume @xmath50 roughly constant as a function of disorder .",
    "thus , with the loss of @xmath55 rings , @xmath46 will decrease with respect to @xmath50 and the @xmath12@xmath52 relation will no longer hold . in this regime , @xmath12@xmath56 ( @xmath57 being the number of ordered rings ) , and the development of a d peak indicates ordering , exactly the opposite to stage 1  @xcite .",

    "<S> we quantify this effect and present a simple equation for the determination of the point defect density in graphene via raman spectroscopy for any visible excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , for all excitations , the d to g intensity ratio reaches a maximum for an inter - defect distance@xmath13 nm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a given ratio could correspond to two different defect densities , above or below the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the g peak width and its dispersion with excitation energy solves this ambiguity . </S>"
