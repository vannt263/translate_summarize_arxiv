    "the perturbative qcd description of many observables measured at colliders is plagued by large corrections arising from soft and collinear parton emission , even for fairly generic kinematical conditions .",
    "for example , near threshold , large logarithmic corrections remain @xcite after cancellation of singular virtual and real gluon contributions , their large size being a result of the nearby threshold restricting the real gluons to be soft . in terms of a ( mellin )",
    "variable @xmath5 , in terms of which threshold is approached by @xmath6 , such large threshold corrections take the form ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 where the @xmath9 depend in general on the process .",
    "another example @xcite is when an identified part @xmath10 of a final state has acquired small transverse momentum by soft recoil ( @xmath11 ) against the remaining , unmeasured part of the final state .",
    "then the perturbative expression for the differential cross section with respect to @xmath12 of @xmath10 takes again the form of eq .  , but with different coefficients @xmath9 and with @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the impact parameter fourier conjugate to @xmath11 .",
    "such large logarithmic corrections can be brought under control by all - order resummation , and there exists a large literature demonstrating the viability , where applicable , of threshold , recoil as well as their joint resummation , for a wide variety of observables .",
    "it is interesting to try to extend all - order control to classes of large terms beyond the logarithmic corrections .",
    "one such new set consists of numerically large constants ( `` @xmath15 terms '' ) originating from the same infrared - sensitive regions of those feynman diagrams that also produce the logarithms @xcite",
    ".    another important class of potentially large terms , of soft - collinear origin , can be represented as @xmath16 their phenomenological importance was first demonstrated in ref .",
