    "cold molecules have been the subject of intense study over the last few years  @xcite . in particular , the manipulation of a magnetic field around a zero - energy resonance has been used for producing both thermal and condensed molecular gases from cold atoms . typically , the magnetic field is linearly ramped across the resonance  @xcite , although other techniques have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "detection of cold molecules often relies upon their dissociation , followed by measurement of the resulting atomic gas .",
    "dissociation is commonly performed by photodissociation  @xcite or linearly ramping the magnetic field across the resonance  @xcite .",
    "linear ramps for molecule detection are often slow in order to minimise the speed of the fragments to be imaged .",
    "such sweeps have also been used to determine resonance widths  @xcite .",
    "fast sweeps have been used to measure the population of more than one partial wave  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study in detail dissociation by linear ramps across zero - energy resonances over the whole range of possible ramp speeds .",
    "we show that the dissociation process can be used to probe the nature of the resonance . in the limit of a sudden change in the magnetic field strength",
    "the distribution of atomic kinetic energy , referred to as the dissociation spectrum , can have a sharp peak at an energy dependent on the final magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "our studies show that such spectra occur only for resonances with weak interchannel coupling .",
    "consequently , resonances may be classified by measuring the peak , which can be done while little is known about the resonance other than its position .",
    "this classification scheme applies to feshbach molecules formed from both bose and fermi gases .",
    "the strength of the interchannel coupling affects the suitability of the resonance for studying phenomena of current experimental interest .",
    "for example , halo molecules such as long - range dimers and three - body thomas - efimov states are more easily studied using strongly coupled , entrance - channel dominated resonances  @xcite , whereas feshbach molecules created with closed - channel dominated resonances are usually unstable with respect to collisions  @xcite .",
    "we study the transition from sudden magnetic field changes , referred to as jumps , to asymptotically wide , linear ramps , as the ramp speed and initial and final fields are changed .",

    "dissociation spectra produced by magnetic field jumps and their application to classifying resonances are discussed in section  [ sec : jump ] .",

    "we discuss the different theoretical techniques that may be applied , and the validity of approximating a given , finite ramp to be asymptotic .",

    "atom - atom scattering in a cold gas can be magnetically tuned because of the coupling that exists between scattering channels with different spin configurations . the diatomic spin configuration corresponding to the zeeman state of each atom in the gas is referred to as the entrance channel .",

    "we choose the zero of energy to coincide at each magnetic field @xmath4 with the dissociation threshold of the entrance channel .",
