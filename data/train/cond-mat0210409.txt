    "we consider a diffusive normal - insulating - normal - insulating - superconducting ( @xmath2 ) junction ( see fig .",

    "the short diffusive region @xmath5 , which does not contribute to the junction resistance , leads to complete isotropization of the system parameters between the barriers .",
    "@xcite this makes the junction effectively zero dimensional @xcite and the exact shape and size of the diffusive region is thus not important .",
    "the conductances @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the two tunnel barriers can be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of transport modes at the barrier @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the transparency of mode @xmath15 .",

    "we can neglect coulomb blockade effects as well as weak localization like corrections to the cumulants of the current .",

    "we are also only interested in zero frequency properties.@xcite with these assumptions , we can analyze the full counting statistics of the junction within the framework of the circuit theory , recently developed by nazarov@xcite and belzig and nazarov.@xcite very recently , a detailed discussion of the circuit theory was given .",

    "we can derive all cumulants of the current by repeatedly taking the derivative with respect to the counting field @xmath34 ( or @xmath41 ) .",
    "for the two first cumulants , current and noise , we have ( evaluated at the @xmath21-contact ) , @xmath63 @xmath64 and similarly for higher order cumulants .",
    "in what follows we focus on the limit @xmath65 . in this limit , the physics is dominated by the induced proximity effect in the diffusive region @xmath5 between the two barriers .",
    "@xcite the proximity effect affects the transport properties on the energy scale @xmath66 .",
    "it can on a microscopic level be described as resulting from coherence between the two quasiparticles in the andreev reflection , e.g. an incident electron and a retroreflected hole .",
    "an induced proximity effect leads in general to large modifications of the transport properties , i.e. modifications scaling with the system size .",
    "we note that this is in strong contrast to the situation in normal systems , where phase coherence only gives rise to small quantum corrections . @xcite    however , being a coherent phenomenon , the proximity effect is also sensitive to modifications of the electron and hole phases . at finite energies ,",
    "the electron and hole pick up different phases and at @xmath67 , the electron - hole coherence is destroyed and consequently , the proximity effect is suppressed .",
    "moreover , a magnetic flux in the @xmath5-region large enough to break time reversal symmetry , also suppresses the proximity effect , since the electron and the hole pick up different phases in a finite magnetic field .",
    "here we however only consider the case with negligibly small magnetic fields .",
    "formally , at energies well below the superconducting gap @xmath37 , the matrix greens function @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ sres ] ) simplifies considerably , since @xmath69 and consequently @xmath70 .",
    "we then find @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ cgf ] ) by diagonalizing @xmath71 , giving @xmath72 where we have introduced @xmath73 we note that at @xmath74 , we recover the generating function of ref .

    "this pair transport follows from the fact that the charge transfer mechanism across the @xmath78-interface is andreev reflection .",
    "the form of the cumulant generating function , with the double square roots , tells that the pair transfer is highly correlated .",
    "there are however several limits where the generating function is simply proportional to @xmath79 , describing an uncorrelated , ( generalized ) poissonian , transfer of pairs of electrons ( as follows from eq .",
    "[ qcount ] ) .    in the limit of high energy , @xmath48 , for arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the integrand of the generating function in eq .",
    "( [ cgflowenergy ] ) takes on the form @xmath80 for these energies , the probability of pair tunneling is strongly suppressed and the pairs are thus emitted in a poisson process .",
    "this is a consequence of the different phases picked up by the electrons and holes , @xmath81 , at finite energies . at @xmath48",
    "the electrons and holes loose their coherence and the pair tunneling probability is suppressed .    in the limit of a dominating coupling of the diffusive region @xmath5 to the normal reservoir , @xmath82 , the integrand of the generating function becomes @xmath83 thus , in this limit",
    ", the pair transfer is also uncorrelated . in this case",
    ", the barrier @xmath6 has a negligible resistance compared to @xmath3 and the junction is effectively a @xmath84-junction .",
    "as discussed above , in this case the pair transfer is uncorrelated .",
    "we note that for high energies @xmath48 , it coincides with eq .",
    "( [ cgfe ] ) , ( for @xmath82 ) .",
    "we also note@xcite that for the limit @xmath85 , strong coupling of @xmath5 to the superconductor and for the additional limit of low energies , @xmath86 , the pair transfer is uncorrelated . in this case",
    ", the integrand of the generating function is simply @xmath87 the reason for the uncorrelated pair transfer in this case is the following : in the limit @xmath88 , a proximity gap opens up in @xmath5 and the junction becomes an effective @xmath89 junction ( @xmath90 denoting the gapped normal region between the barriers ) . for energies below the induced gap ,",
    "the pair transfer is thus poissonian , as in a standard @xmath1-junctions .",
    "@xcite    making a connection to the proximity effect , it can be noted that the in two cases , eq .",
    "( [ cgfe ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ cgfg1g2 ] ) , the strongly suppressed proximity effect in @xmath5 is responsible for the uncorrelated pair transport .",
    "however , in the last case , eq .",
    "( [ cgfg2g1 ] ) , the poissonian pair transfer is due to the induced proximity gap in @xmath5 .",
    "it is instructive to also study qualitatively the full counting statistics , starting from the scattering point of view in ref .",
    "the cumulant generating function , generalized to many modes , is @xmath91 where the @xmath92 s are the andreev reflection eigenvalues , i.e. the real and energy dependent eigenvalues of the hermitian electron - hole scattering matrix product @xmath93 ( see e.g. ref . [ ] ) . here",
    "@xmath94 denotes ensemble average over impurity configurations and @xmath79 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ countfield ] ) . for a general function @xmath95",
    ", the ensemble average can be written as an integration @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the distribution of andreev reflection eigenvalues ( the corresponding quantity in ns - systems to the transmission eigenvalue distribution in normal systems ) .",
    "expanding the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ cgfmuz ] ) , makes it is clear that the limits where the charge transfer is uncorrelated , eqs .",
    "( [ cgfe ] ) to ( [ cgfg2g1 ] ) , corresponds to the limit where @xmath98 ( and consequently @xmath99 for all higher moments @xmath100 since @xmath101 ) .    from this",
    "we can draw the following conclusions .",
    "the limits of uncorrelated pair transfer corresponds to the cases where there are no or very few `` open '' andreev channels , i.e with andreev reflection probability close to unity ( leading to @xmath102 ) . in the case where there are more open channels , the various moments @xmath103 are of the same order of magnitude , resulting e.g. in a noise below the poissonian noise of uncorrelated pair transfer across the ns - interface , further discussed below .",
    "as is also further discussed below , this andreev channel picture provides a simple explanation for the voltage and temperature dependence of the noise as well as the current .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the properties of the the second cumulant , the noise , which is within reach of existing experimental techniques .",
    "we note that the cumulant generating function @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ cgflowenergy ] ) can be written as @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) times a function which only contains the ratio @xmath104 , i.e. all transport properties studied below , ( normalized ) depend only on the ratio of the conductances .",

    "<S> we present an investigation of the energy dependence of the full charge counting statistics in diffusive normal - insulating - normal - insulating - superconducting junctions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the current in general is transported via a correlated transfer of pairs of electrons . only in the case of strongly asymmetric tunnel barriers or energies much larger than the thouless energy is the pair transfer uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> the second cumulant , the noise , is found to depend strongly on the applied voltage and temperature . for a junction resistance dominated by the tunnel barrier to the normal reservoir </S>",
    "<S> , the differential shot noise shows a double peak feature at voltages of the order of the thouless energy , a signature of an ensemble averaged electron - hole resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for current transport across a normal conductor - superconducting ( ns ) interface , at energies below the superconducting gap , is andreev reflection . </S>",
    "<S> an electron incident from the normal conductor is retroreflected into a hole , and a charge of @xmath0 is transported into the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that electrons are transfered across the ns - interface in pairs has recently attracted a lot of interest to noise in ns - systems , @xcite since the noise can provide information about the charge transfer mechanism .    in some ns - systems , </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise is doubled compared to the noise in the corresponding normal system . in a normal - insulating - superconducting ( nis ) junction , the pairs tunnel with a small probability between the normal and the superconducting reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a poisson noise of pairs of electrons , which is thus twice as large as standard poisson noise . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite such pair poissonian noise was recently observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    also in diffusive wire ns - junctions , a doubling of the shot noise has been predicted theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite for applied voltages much smaller as well as much larger than the thouless energy . however , for intermediate voltages , of the order of the thouless energy , the shot noise deviates from the double normal value , @xcite a behavior related to the induced proximity effect in the normal conductor .    in general , in mesoscopic ns - systems , there is no simple relation between the shot noise in the normal and the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> this has been demonstrated for a wide variety of multi - mode systems such as diffusive nis - junctions , @xcite chaotic - dot superconductor junctions @xcite , multiterminal superconducting tunnel junctions@xcite and wide ballistic double - barrier@xcite and normal slab@xcite superconductor junctions , as well as few - mode superconducting systems containing beam - splitters,@xcite disordered tunnel junctions @xcite and double barrier junctions.@xcite    to obtain complete knowledge of the charge transfer in ns - systems , it is thus not sufficient to study the shot noise . </S>",
    "<S> instead , one has to investigate the full charge counting statistics.@xcite this was originally done by muzykanskii and khmelnitskii,@xcite who showed that the statistics of the charge transfer across a ns - interface with arbitrary transparency , can in general be described as a correlated transfer of pairs of electrons . only in the limit of a low transparency @xmath1 junction , </S>",
    "<S> the transfer of pairs is uncorrelated , poissonian . using a recently developed circuit theory approach @xcite to full counting statistics , </S>",
    "<S> the charge transfer statistics has been studied in several systems containing superconductors , such as short sns - junctions , @xcite diffusive ns - junctions,@xcite diffusive superconducting tunnel junctions@xcite and chaotic dot - superconducing junctions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , in these works , the main focus has been on the low voltage- and temperature properties , the full energy dependence of the counting statistics was only analyzed numerically in ref . [ ] .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the energy dependent full counting statistics of a diffusive normal - insulating - normal - insulating - superconducting ( @xmath2 ) junction . </S>",
    "<S> this system is interesting for several reasons . using the circuit theory approach , @xcite an analytical expression for the full </S>",
    "<S> voltage and temperature dependence of the counting statistics can be derived . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to investigate in detail the energy dependence of the charge transfer mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the role of the proximity effect , which is of particular interest , since it gives rise to a large , energy dependent modification of the transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the conductance in @xmath2 systems was recently studied experimentally,@xcite and very good agreement was found between the experiment and the quasiclassical greens function theory@xcite on which the circuit theory is based . </S>",
    "<S> this makes a detailed analysis of the experimentally accessible noise of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current is in general transported via a correlated transfer of pairs of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the cases where the resistance is dominated by the tunnel barrier @xmath3 , at the @xmath4 interface , or for energies well above the thouless energy , the pair transfer is uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> these cases correspond to the limit of weak proximity effect in the normal region @xmath5 . in the opposite regime of strong proximity effect in @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> when the resistance is dominated by the tunnel barrier @xmath6 at the @xmath7 interface , a proximity gap opens up in the @xmath5-region . for energies below the induced proximity gap , </S>",
    "<S> the junction is effectively a nis - junction and the pair transfer is again uncorrelated .    </S>",
    "<S> the second cumulant , the noise , is found to depend strongly on the applied voltage and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for a junction resistance dominated by the tunnel barrier @xmath6 , at the @xmath8 interface , and a temperature well below the thouless energy , the differential noise shows a double - peak feature at voltages of the order of the thouless energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this double - peak behavior can be attributed to an ensemble averaged electron - hole resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first present the circuit theory model and the derivation of the full charge counting statistics . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter , the dependence of the counting statistics on energy and tunnel barrier ( @xmath6 and @xmath3 ) conductances is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the temperature and voltage dependence of the noise in detail . </S>"
