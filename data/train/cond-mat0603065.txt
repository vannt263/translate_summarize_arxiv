    "restoration of microscopic isotropy in fractals with microscopic anisotropy is observed in various physical systems , including percolation @xcite , diffusion and random walks @xcite , resister networks@xcite , and gaussian field theories @xcite . such phenomena are unique in the sense that they are absent in uniform media , while they are universal in the sense that they are observed in a wide class of fractals .    the isotropic spin 1/2 ising model on the sierpiski gasket ( sg )",
    "is known to have no phase transitions at finite temperature .",
    "but the correlation length exhibits a drastic divergence as the temperature approaches zero @xcite",
    ". it would be quite interesting to determine whether the anisotropic version of the model exhibits isotropy restoration .    indeed , brody and ritz @xcite , and later bhattacharyya and chakrabarti @xcite studied this problem in a partially anisotropic ising model ( which is obtained by setting @xmath0 or @xmath1 in our model ) on the sg .",
    "interestingly , they reached opposite conclusions : ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that there is a complete restoration , while ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that restoration is impossible .    in the present paper",
    ", we carefully examine this ( controversial ) problem of isotropy restoration in the ising model on the sg .",
    "we study a general anisotropic model in which spin - spin interactions take three different values , according to the directions of the bonds .    in order to test for the possible restoration of isotropy",
    ", we define the correlation length for each of the three directions of the lattice .",
    "when the temperature is sufficiently high , the ratios among the three correlation lengths are almost the same as those of the interactions .",
    "we conclude that the behavior of the correlation lengths respects the anisotropy of the system .",
    "a nontrivial question is whether the isotropy is restored when the temperature approaches zero and the correlation lengths diverge .",
    "we have examined the behavior of the correlation lengths using the renormalization group , and found that the isotropy is indeed restored .",
    "however , we also found that , depending on the interactions , the restoration can be either perfect or partial .",
    "when perfect restoration takes place , all the ratios among the correlation lengths approach unity as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "when a partial restoration takes place , on the other hand , the ratio of the two correlation lengths approaches unity , and the other correlation length becomes infinitely larger , as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "it should be stressed that our result agrees with neither the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite nor that of ref .",
    "we have shown that the actual phenomena are much richer than those predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "we do , however , understand why such different conclusions have been reached . as we discuss in section  [ diff ] , both refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite essentially rely on simple approximate forms of the rg equation .",
    "but , as will be clear from the careful study presented here , the rg flow in this problem can not be reduced to a single approximate map ; one needs to use different forms in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "we thus believe that our analysis , which is clearly more elaborate and careful than the previous two , resolves the controversy and reveals the true behavior of the model .",
    "we also stress that no distinction between perfect and partial restoration of isotropy , as we have found in the present model , has been observed in other models @xcite in which only perfect restoration was found .",
    "we still do not know why partial restoration is found only in the ising model .",
    "let us stress that the restoration of isotropy is a phenomenon peculiar to physical systems on fractals . in the ising model on regular lattices , it is believed that the ratios of the correlation lengths respect the anisotropy of the underlying interactions , no matter how large the correlation lengths are .",
    "here we define the model and state our main results .",
    "we construct the sg following the standard procedure ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we consider an equilateral triangle formed by bonds of unit length , and call this the first generation sg .",
    "we then put three of these triangles together to construct the second generation sg , which is identical to the original triangle with all sides doubled in length . in the next step",
    ", we put three second generation sgs together and form the third generation sg . by continuing this procedure recursively , we construct the @xmath2-th generation sg .",
    "we define an ising model on the @xmath2-th generation sg by associating with each site an ising spin .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is @xmath3 where the sums are taken over all the pairs of neighboring spins .",
    "we label each spin variable according to the oblique coordinates , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the positive constants @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the exchange interactions in the three directions .",
    "the thermal expectation value of any function @xmath7 at temperature @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a shorthand for the sum over all the spins @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the inverse temperature .",
    "we define the correlation length in the horizontal direction @xmath13 by @xmath14 similarly , we define the correlation lengths @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the other two directions as in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "our definition ( [ eq : modoki ] ) of the correlation length is motivated by the observation that the correlation between spins at two ends of the lattice should behave as @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this is apparently different from the usual definition , motivated by the observation that @xmath18 $ ] for any sites @xmath19 , @xmath20 . for the ising model on a regular lattice , however , the two definitions are known to give the same correlation length ( at least in the high - temperature region ) . here",
    "we conjecture equivalence , and therefor employ the simpler definition , ( [ eq : modoki ] ) .",
    "we can now state our main results .",
    "we choose the interactions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 so as to satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "when the temperature approaches zero ( which is the critical point of the model ) , the correlation lengths diverge . for the ratios of the correlation lengths ,",
    "we show that as @xmath22 we have @xmath23 if @xmath24 which corresponds to the shaded region 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , and @xmath25 if @xmath26 which corresponds to the shaded region 2 in fig .  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "these correspond to the partial and perfect restoration of isotropy discussed in the introduction .",
    "moreover , when the interactions satisfy ( [ eq : partial2 ] ) , and we have a partial isotropy restoration ( [ eq : partial ] ) , we can show that the leading - order singular behavior of the correlation lengths is given by @xmath27,\\\\ \\xi_3(t ) & \\simeq & \\exp\\left[(\\ln 2)e^{2(j_1+j_2)/(k_{b}t)}\\right]\\exp\\left[\\frac{2(j_3-j_1 - 2j_2)}{k_{b}t}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath28 .",
    "we see that the correlation lengths diverge as a double exponential of @xmath29 , while the ratio @xmath30 diverges as a single exponential of @xmath29 .",
    "( the double exponential behavior is peculiar to the ising model on the sg , and it was previously found in the isotropic model with @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite . )    in the next section , we derive these results using the exact renormalization group method .",
