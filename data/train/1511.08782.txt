    "while the temperature and entropy remain related to the surface gravity and area in the usual way , the mass ends up being related not to the internal energy @xmath7 of the system , but the _ enthalpy _ , @xmath8 , as discussed in ref.@xcite : @xmath9 where the volume @xmath6 is the conjugate of the pressure @xmath10 , following from the first law which is now @xmath11 the black holes may have other parameters such as gauge charges @xmath12 and angular momenta @xmath13 , and these , with their conjugates the potentials @xmath14 and angular velocities @xmath15 , enter additively into the first law in the usual manner .",
    "this extended black hole thermodynamics formalism works in multiple dimensions .",
    "( interestingly , in the static black hole case , the thermodynamic volume @xmath6 is associated with the naive volume occupied by the black hole itself : the volume of the ball of radius given by the horizon radius ( denoted @xmath16 here ) .",
    "it was noted in ref.@xcite that since pressure and volume variables are now present alongside temperature and entropy , a device for extracting useful mechanical work from heat energy  a traditional heat engine  may be defined .",
    "( similarly , heat pumps or refrigerators , where instead work is done to transfer heat from a cold reservoir to a hot one may be defined as well . )",
    "such devices were dubbed  holographic heat engines \" , since especially in the case of negative cosmological constant ( where pressure is positive ) such cycles presumably represent a journey through a family of holographically dual@xcite non  gravitational large @xmath2 field theories defined in one dimension fewer .",
    "the physics of such engines may possibly have interesting and instructive implications for those field theory tours , which may be uncovered when the dictionary between this extended thermodynamics and holography is fully worked out , as discussed in ref.@xcite , but that is not the subject of this paper and so we will turn away from that issue henceforth .",
    "the black hole defines an equation of state , coming from the relation between the temperature , horizon radius , other black hole parameters , and the cosmological constant .",
    "it defines ( either implicitly or explicitly ) a function @xmath17 , and our engine can be defined as a closed path in the @xmath18 plane , allowing for the input of an amount of heat @xmath19 , and the exhaust of an amount  @xmath20 .",
    "l0.3        the total mechanical work done , by the first law , is of course @xmath21 . a central quantity , the efficiency of the heat engine ,",
    "is defined to be @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig : heatengine ] shows the standard logic of the energy flows for one cycle of the engine .",
    "the exact properties of the engine depends upon the equation of state ( defined by the type of black hole ) and the choice of path in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "of course , the efficiency of the engine is bounded above by the carnot efficiency given by that of a reversible heat engine made by expanding along an isotherm , and then an adiabat , followed by contracting along an isotherm and then using an adiabat to close the path . with the isotherms at temperatures @xmath23 and  @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , the carnot efficiency is @xmath26    interestingly , as also noted in ref.@xcite , the other simple ( but in general less efficient ) choice , connecting the isotherms by isochoric paths defining the stirling cycle , turns out to be equivalent to carnot for static black holes .",
    "this is because in such cases the entropy and the volume both depend on the same single variable , the horizon radius , and are therefore not independent@xcite .",
    "so isochores and adiabats are identical in such cases making stirling equivalent to carnot .",
    "r0.43        that last observation is also equivalent to the fact that the specific heat at constant volume , @xmath27 , vanishes for static black holes . on the other hand",
    ",  @xmath28 can be quite explicitly computed in terms of @xmath16 and hence the entropy or the volume .",
    "this is useful because it means that another cycle in the @xmath18 plane is natural to think about : a rectangle composed of isobars and isochores .",
    "the heat flows and hence the efficiency is in principle readily computable if one has a suitable expression for @xmath28 .",
    "looking at figure [ fig : cyclesb ] , the work done along the isobars is : @xmath29 where the subscripts refer to the quantities evaluated at the corners labeled ( 1,2,3,4 ) .",
    "the heat flows take place along the top and bottom , with the upper isobar giving the net inflow of heat , which is therefore @xmath19 , and so : @xmath30 the efficiency is then @xmath31 .",
    "to get an explicit expression requires one to be able to write the specific heat in terms of @xmath32 in order to do the integral .",
    "this turns out to be difficult to do exactly , since the natural variable to get @xmath28 in terms of is @xmath33 , and turning that into a @xmath32 dependence is somewhat messy .",
    "it is at this point that one can move to a more tractable regime for the problem , and do a high temperature expansion . in the next section",
    "we will review how that works somewhat more thoroughly than was explored in the original reference , in order to prepare for the generalisation we will explore in this paper , the case of black holes in gauss ",

    "maxwell action ( with @xmath34 ) is interesting and important to consider since generically , whatever the parent theory of quantum gravity may be , there will be higher order corrections to the pure einstein sector , and gauss  bonnet is a particular combination of terms that allows for tractable systematic investigation of the effects of such corrections .",
    "additionally , such terms represent part of the @xmath3 correction to the large  @xmath2 limit of the holographically dual @xmath36like gauge field theory .",
    "so while this study is interesting in its own right , exploring the properties of holographic heat engines after including corrections to the leading order gravity theory , there is also the possibility that we learn something about how their properties are adjusted away from the large @xmath2 limit , using gauss  bonnet as a laboratory , in the spirit of _",
    "e.g. _ refs.@xcite",
    ".    we will be able to answer the question ( at least in the high temperature limit ) as to whether the key quantity , the efficiency of the heat engine , increases or decreases in the presence of the gauss  bonnet terms .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ obvious what the answer should be . on the one hand",
    "the heat capacity of the holes may increase or decrease , but on the other hand since the gauss  bonnet terms also affect their geometry ( affecting @xmath16 and hence the thermodynamic volume @xmath6 ) , their capacity to do work may also be affected one way or another .",

    "looking at the form of the large @xmath32 expansions for the various ingredients of the efficiency  ( [ eq:5dexpansions - alpha ] ) , it is clear that increasing @xmath138 undermines the accuracy of the large @xmath32 expansion , and therefore we should distrust features at large @xmath112 . in figure",

    "it is worth noting that the @xmath79 case was explored explicitly as well , for each scheme , and the qualitative structure of the results in the physical range of equation  ( [ eq : constrain - alpha ] ) was found to be the same as for the @xmath35 case explored here , so no detailed results are reported from that case .",
    "it is expected that higher @xmath37 will also work similarly since there are no key new features in the equation of state or other key relations that can arise as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "after careful clarification and extension of the results of ref.@xcite for holographic heat engines in einstein ",
    "maxwell gravity ( with negative @xmath4 ) we added a gauss  bonnet sector and computed analogous results for similarly defined heat engines .",
    "it was particularly interesting to see what happens to the efficiency @xmath99 ( at least in the large @xmath32 limit ) in the presence of the gauss  bonnet sector , for a particular choice of engine cycle ( defined in figure  [ fig : cyclesb ] ) .",
    "such higher curvature corrections to the gravity theory affect both the black holes heat capacity and their ability to do mechanical work ( since their size depends upon the gauss bonnet coefficient @xmath106 ) and hence it is not _ a priori _ obvious as to how the efficiency would be affected .",
    "moreover , we learned that how @xmath99 is affected also depends upon what parameters of the engine cycle are held fixed as @xmath106 , the coefficient of the gauss  bonnet terms , is changed .",
    "we compared the efficiency as a function of @xmath106 to two natural quantities : ( 1 ) the efficiency at @xmath156 , denoted @xmath157 , and ( 2 ) the maximum ( carnot ) efficiency , @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , we examined two schemes for which parameters of the engine to hold fixed as we change @xmath106 , and the effects on the efficiency differed in each scheme .",
    "this is because the equation of state is @xmath106 dependent , and so the parameters of the engine _ not _ held fixed depend upon @xmath106 .",
    "this has a scheme dependent effect on the efficiency .",
    "the question therefore arises as to which is the better overall benchmark for measuring the effects of the gauss  bonnet sector on @xmath99 . if there is anything close to a scheme",
    " independent answer to this question ( and it is not clear that there is ) , perhaps the carnot standard , asking how @xmath141 has changed , is more robust since there is an unambiguous and universal meaning to what that carnot engine is , and its efficiency takes as input only the highest and lowest temperatures ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ) in the engine under discussion .",
    "this becomes even stronger in a scheme ( such as scheme 2 ) which holds @xmath23 and @xmath24 fixed as @xmath106 varies .",
    "the physics of einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant is believed to be holographically dual to large @xmath2 ( for suitably defined @xmath2 ) field theories in one dimension fewer , and higher curvature corrections such as gauss  bonnet terms correspond to particular classes of @xmath3 corrections to the duality . while it is not yet clear what they might teach us about the dual field theories , our holographic heat engines define cycles on the space of the dual field theories@xcite ( since varying @xmath0 ends up changing the @xmath2 of the field theory ( _ e.g. _ the @xmath2 in an @xmath36 yang  mills in the case of @xmath35 ) .",
    "our new results then tell us about the changes to the efficiency of the engines once certain @xmath3 corrections are added .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the meaning of our results from a field theory perspective , but this awaits further work on the precise meaning of the heat engine cycles for the dual field theory",
    ".    it would also be interesting to study the effects on the heat engines that can be defined for other classes of extension or deformation of einstein  maxwell gravity , whether motivated by dual field theory considerations or not .",
