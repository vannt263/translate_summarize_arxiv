    "is the bosonization @xcite .",
    "when ( i ) the spectrum is linearized , ( ii ) backscattering processes are neglected , and ( iii ) the physics near equilibrium is explored , the bosonization reduces the original interacting problem to a gaussian field theory , thus reducing evaluation of physical observables to a straightforward calculation of gaussian integrals .",
    "when one ( or several ) of the above three conditions is not fulfilled , the theoretical analysis becomes much more involved . in the present paper",
    "we will focus on non - equilibrium physics of 1d fermionic systems in the regime where the spectral curvature is of crucial importance .",
    "properties of 1d interacting systems with spectral nonlinearity have been addressed in a series of recent theoretical works@xcite . here",
    "we will consider the time evolution of a density pulse created by a local quench in a 1d fermionic system ( that will be assumed to be spinless or spin - polarized for simplicity ) .",
    "we will assume that this pulse is quasiclassical ( i.e. , has a characteristic spatial extension much larger than the fermi wave length ) and sufficiently strong ( i.e. , contains a large number of electrons ) .",
    "for not too long times the evolution seems to be fully harmless : the pulse splits into left- and right - moving parts that separate and move away from each other , approximately preserving theirs shape .",
    "they key point is that the shape would remain strictly unchanged only for linear dispersion of excitations , while the non - linearity of dispersion leads to a deformation of the pulse . as a result , at a certain finite time the pulse tends to `` overturn '' .",
    "the problem to be addressed is what happens with the density profile beyond this time .",
    "the above problem was formulated in ref .   in the context of calogero model that was argued to describe the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) edges ( see also a recent paper ref .  ) . using quantum hydrodynamics approach , the authors of refs",
    ".   came to a conclusion that a density pulse formed in a fqh edge will evolve in a sequence of well separated solitons with a quantized charge ( equal to @xmath3 for laughlin states ) .    in the present work",

    "we show that once the semiclassical phase - space distribution overturns ( i.e. develops a population inversion characterized by three `` fermi momenta '' ) , strong oscillations of density are generated in the corresponding region of space .",
    "the characteristic scale of these oscillations is much larger than the fermi wave length @xmath4 .",
    "the oscillations can be understood as friedel oscillations between different fermi - momentum branches .    in sec .",

    "we show that although dispersive terms arise already within haldane bosonization formalism of free fermions with curvature , the dominant terms should come from summing the loop expansion .",
    "while we do not know how to take into account these effects systematically , we approximate them by including in the classical hydrodynamic equation a term corresponding to an upper ( for a positive pulse ) branch of the particle - hole continuum . solving the corresponding equation ( which is of benjamin - ono type ) , we show that it yields oscillations with correct period ( including its spatial variation ) but with an amplitude several times larger than the right one .",
    "this shows that the above classical hydrodynamic equation does catch some important physics of the developing `` dispersive shock '' of a free - fermion pulse but does not represent a fully controllable approximation .",
    "section [ s4 ] is devoted to an analysis of the interaction effects on the pulse evolution .",
    "we consider first the case of a short - range interaction and argue that the discovered oscillations remain largely preserved , up to two modifications : ( i ) conventional luttinger - liquid renormalization of the fermi velocity , and ( ii ) washing out of oscillations at long times due to inelastic processes .",
    "we turn then to the case of a long - range interaction .",
    "we show that when the interaction decays sufficiently slowly ( specifically , @xmath5 at large distances @xmath2 , and @xmath1 is a electronic mass ) , the leading contribution to the dispersion results from the interaction term , and the problem can be treated quasiclassically ( i.e. loops can be neglected ) , giving rise to a classical hydrodynamic equation .",
    "the evolution of the pulse according to such an equation depends crucially on the sign of the pulse and the sign of the interaction ( or , more precisely , on the relative sign between them ) .",
    "when the interaction is repulsive and the density pulse is downward , oscillations develop similarly to the case of free fermions ( or short - range interaction ) .",
    "the period of oscillations gets however parametrically larger . on the other hand , for an upward pulse ( and still assuming a repulsive long - range interaction ) , the pulse splits in a sequence of `` solitons '' ( whose charge is in general not quantized , except for the case of @xmath6 interaction ) .",

    "we model the quantum correction by including in the theory a dispersive term corresponding to a particle or hole branch of the fermionic spectrum , depending on the sign of the initial perturbation .",
    "this yields two different hydrodynamic theories ( with a difference in the sign of the dispersive term ) for upward and downward density pulses .",
    "+ we show that this approach correctly captures the period of shock - induced density oscillation but overestimates their amplitude . in the hydrodynamic language , the formation of oscillations is caused by an interplay of the non - linearity ( caused by the spectrum curvature ) and the dispersion ( dominated , in the case of free fermions , by quantum corrections carrying information about the spectral curvature ) .",

    "a notable exception is the cs model with @xmath209 , when the solitons carry a unit charge .",
    "we hope that our predictions can be verified experimentally .",

    "an important task is to perform ab initio calculations for many - body quantum interacting system .",
    "the results should allow one to verify our above predictions ( obtained in the framework of the hydrodynamic theory ) and to explore the interplay of quantum corrections and interaction ( e.g. in the model with a finite - range interaction ) .",
