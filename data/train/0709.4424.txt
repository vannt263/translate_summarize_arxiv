    "the lack of precise control over standard condensed matter systems has hindered the development of experiments that can probe systematically the effects of strong correlations .",
    "however , the large degree of control in atomic systems , has made them powerful tools for studying many condensed matter phenomena , and in particular novel superfluid phases  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a current research frontier is the study of fermion mixtures with population imbalance  @xcite . since the population of each component as well as their interaction strength are experimentally tunable , these knobs enabled the study of the bcs to bec evolution in population imbalanced two - component fermion superfluids  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the crossover physics found in the population balanced case  @xcite , these experiments have demonstrated the existence of phase transitions between normal and superfluid phases , as well as phase separation between superfluid ( paired ) and normal ( excess ) fermions as a function of population imbalance  @xcite .    motivated by these recent experiments , there has been intense theoretical interest in understanding the phase diagram of population imbalanced mixtures  @xcite .",
    "so far , an accurate description of such mixtures is only available in the weak fermion attraction limit , and it is yet to be developed for intermediate fermion attraction around unitarity , or for the strong attraction limit . some progress has been made in the strong attraction limit , where fermi - fermi mixtures were described as a weakly interacting bose - fermi mixture  @xcite , however , the effective boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering parameters were obtained only in the born approximation .",
    "strictly speaking , the bose - fermi description is valid only in the strong attraction limit , but may also provide semi - quantitative understanding of the phase diagram close to unitarity .",
    "thus , the main goal of this manuscript is to analyze the boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering parameters beyond the born approximation for arbitrary mass ratio of fermions , and use the effective bose - fermi mixture description to generate improved phase diagrams and density profiles of fermi - fermi mixtures with equal or unequal masses in the strong attraction limit beyond the born and mean - field approximations  @xcite .",
    "the main results of this manuscript are as follows .",
    "first , we analyze three- and four - fermion scattering processes and obtain the exact boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering lengths as a function of mass anisotropy .",
    "second , we use the exact boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering parameters to construct the phase diagram for fermi - fermi mixtures in the strong attraction limit .",
    "in addition to the normal ( n ) and uniform superfluid ( u ) phases , we find two different non - uniform phase separated ( ps ) states : ( 1 ) phase separation between pure unpaired ( excess ) and pure paired fermions ( molecular bosons ) , and ( 2 ) phase separation between pure excess fermions and a mixture of excess fermions and molecular bosons , depending on the fermion - fermion scattering parameter .",
    "the phase boundaries are very sensitive to the masses of the fermions , and also to the boson - fermion and boson - boson interactions . for equal mass mixtures , our results for the phase boundary between the ps(2 ) and",
    "the uniform ( u ) phase improves on previous saddle - point ( mean - field ) results , and the quantitative changes are substantial , but not dramatic . however , there is a dramatic increase in quantitative differences between mean - field and the present results for unequal mass mixtures as the mass ratio deviates from one . in particular , these differences are more pronounced when heavier fermions are in excess indicating the importance of taking into account scattering processes beyond the born approximation .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the effects of the trapping potential on the density profiles of condensed and non - condensed molecular bosons , as well as excess fermions at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "lastly , we discuss the implications of our findings to possible experiments involving fermi - fermi mixtures with equal or unequal masses and equal or unequal populations .    the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "however , truly quantitative results are currently possible only in the bcs limit , where the theory is simple , but the temperatures required to reach the bcs regime are very low and hard to be achieved experimentally . in the unitarity regime , experiments can be performed and the phase diagram can be explored since the critical temperature for superfluidity is attainable , but an accurate theoretical description of this regime is still lacking . while in the bec limit , not only the temperature required to reach the bec regime is experimentally achievable , but also the theory becomes simple since the fermi - fermi mixtures can be described effectively by a weakly interacting mixture of molecular bosons and excess fermions  @xcite .",
    "however , the initial proposals of such effective bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite can provide only semi - quantitative results for comparison with experiments in the bec regime since the scattering parameters for two molecular bosons and a molecular boson and an excess fermion are obtained only in the born approximation . in order to overcome this defficiency , we discuss next the boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering parameters beyond the born approximation for arbitrary mass ratio .",

    "first , it is quite remarkable that the diagramatic many body approach recovers the few body results for boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering lengths for arbitrary mass ratio @xmath62 .",
    "the diagramatic many body approach is performed in momentum space , while the few body approach is performed in real space .",
    "the two methods are equivalent because all of the possible scattering processes are taken into account exactly in the diagramatic many body approach at @xmath69 for three or four fermions .",

    "in this section we use the effective bose - fermi mixture description  @xcite to analyze the phase diagram of population imbalanced fermi - fermi mixtures in the strong attraction limit .",
    "we describe first the general stability conditions for bose - fermi mixtures at zero temperature , and use this connection to discuss the stability and phase diagrams of fermi - fermi mixtures in the strong attraction limit .",
    "the ground state of bose - fermi mixtures can be described by the free energy  @xcite @xmath74 which characterizes the center - of - mass degrees of freedom for a mixture of single - hyperfine - state bosons and fermions . here",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) are the density and chemical potential of fermions ( bosons ) , @xmath79 is the fermi energy of the fermions , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the repulsive boson - boson and boson - fermion interaction strengths .",
    "the density of single - hyperfine - state fermions in three dimensions is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fermi momentum and @xmath84 is the volume .",
    "the first term in eq .",

    "furthermore , the stability condition in two dimensions does not depend explicitly on the density of fermions ( see also ref .",

    "for an atomic bose - fermi mixture , we can also describe analytically a finer structure of phases .",
    "there are four possible phases  @xcite : ( i ) ps(1 ) where there is phase separation between pure fermions and pure bosons ; ( ii ) ps(2 ) where there is phase separation between pure fermions , and a mixture of fermions and bosons ; ( iii ) ps(3 ) where there is phase separation between pure bosons , and a mixture of fermions and bosons ; and ( iv ) ps(4 ) where there is phase separation between two different mixtures of fermions and bosons .    for a three - dimensional weakly interacting bose - fermi mixture ,",

    "we obtain analytically the condition @xmath99 for the transition from the ps(2 ) to the ps(1 ) phase  @xcite .    in lower dimensions , we find that the structure of the phase diagram is quite different . in two dimensions , the phase separated region consists only of ps(1 ) where there is phase separation between pure fermions and pure bosons . while , for a one - dimensional weakly interacting bose - fermi mixture , the phase separated region consists also of two regions : ( i ) ps(1 ) where there is phase separation between pure fermions and pure bosons , and ( iii )",

    "again , the results in lower dimensions have to be used with caution , since the quantum fluctuations are more pronounced , and may affect these stability conditions .",

    "we also discussed the effects of trapping potentials on the density profiles of condensed and non - condensed molecular bosons , and excess fermions at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "at zero temperature , we found that almost all of the condensed bosons are at the center of the trap , while the excess fermions are pushed to the edges due to the repulsive boson - fermion interactions . at finite temperatures",
    ", we found that non - condensed pairs and excess fermions are created at the center of the trap at the expense of an overall reduction of condensed bosons .",
    "finally , at temperatures above the bec temperature , the number of condensed bosons vanish , and the system becomes a mixture of weakly interacting non - condensed bosons and excess fermions . finally , we discussed that our findings can provide good quantitative comparisons to experiments performed in the same regime of validity of the theory ( bec regime ) , since the boson - fermion and boson - boson scattering parameters that enter our calculations are exact in the dilute limit .",
    "lastly , we think that it is important to perform experiments with fermi - fermi mixtures in the strong attraction limit ( bec regime ) where the theoretical description is simple . in this limit ,",
