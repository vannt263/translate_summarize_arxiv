    "in the past decades , there has been an enormous interest in developing methods to control and modify the light field . in most cases ,",
    "this has been achieved by building specific materials where the light matter interaction strongly modifies the characteristics of the free electromagnetic field .",
    "these new materials result in interesting technological applications as well as theoretical challenges .",
    "important examples are microcavities @xcite , and metamaterials @xcite , which are designed respectively to strengthen the light - matter interaction , and to tailor the refraction index altering the flow of light in a non - trivial way @xcite .    within this scenario , photonic crystals ( pc )",
    "provide one of the most interesting examples of artificially engineered materials .",
    "pcs @xcite ( see @xcite for basic reviews ) are periodically microstructured compounds which tailor the vacuum electromagnetic density of states , creating specific frequency ranges , or gaps , where it vanishes .",
    "reduction or suppression of the density of states within the band gap facilitates light localization and trapping in a bulk material @xcite , as well as the inhibition of spontaneous emission over a broad frequency range .",
    "additionally , the density of states varies rapidly near the edge of the gap , whose frequency we will denote by @xmath0 , which implies that the correlation time of the vacuum fluctuations can be comparable to the characteristic time scales of atoms , quantum dots or nv centers embedded in the pc structure .",
    "hence , an accurate description of the dynamics of systems in contact with highly structured environments , like the radiation field within pcs , may force us to go beyond the usual markovian , and weak coupling approximations @xcite .",
    "therefore , a reliable method to describe the full system dynamics is highly desirable .    here",
    ", we demonstrate that the efficient , numerically accurate method developed in @xcite ( tedopa : time evolving density with orthogonal polynomials algorithm ) is an excellent candidate to describe the dynamics of quantum systems , such as impurity atoms and quantum dots , within structured reservoirs and quantum fields . to this end",
    ", we apply tedopa to describe the dynamics of a two level atom embedded in a photonic crystal .",
    "our reason to chose such a system as a test bed is that , under certain limits and within the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , it is known to be exactly solvable , thus providing an excellent arena to prove the reliability of our technique .",
    "most importantly , the method deployed here is valuable in describing the dynamics without the usual weak coupling and rwa . by evolving the system without invoking rwa , strong departures from the rwa result",
    "are found .",
    "we will show that when the system - environment coupling is strong , the atomic population dynamics differ from the rwa solution and an enhanced population trapping can be observed .",
    "when the system energy splitting , @xmath1 , is much smaller than any other system and environment time scale , the rwa leads to an unphysical prediction for the system s coherence in the low frequency domain while tedopa allows to evaluate the accurate dynamics across the whole frequency domain .",
    "we consider a single atom or quantum dot , modeled as a two - level system with transition frequency @xmath1 , coupled to the modified radiation field that exists within a photonic crystal .",
    "the general interaction hamiltonian can then be written in interaction picture as follows ( @xmath2 ) @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the atomic spin ladder operators , @xmath5 are the two polarization modes of the light , and @xmath6 is the field wave vector . in writing the hamiltonian in this way , we ignore , for simplicity , any effects related to light polarisation and the existence of multiple bands in photonic cystrals @xcite .",
    "the frequencies are defined as @xmath7 , and we consider @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an effective mass acquired by a photon in a pc @xcite , corresponding to the dispersion relation of the radiation field for frequencies in the vicinity of a single band - gap edge with frequency @xmath0 , and @xmath10 . following refs .",
    "@xcite , the microscopic form for the coupling between the light field and optical transition is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electric permittivity in vacuum , @xmath14 is the quantization volume , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment with @xmath17 the electric charge and @xmath18 the bohr radius , and @xmath19 for @xmath5 represents the unitary polarization vector corresponding to the two transverse polarization modes .",
    "the factor @xmath20 physically arises from the fact that when calculating the coupling ( see for instance @xcite ) , one should take into account that the electronic wave functions have a finite width @xmath18 . here",
    ", we have considered that the electronic wave function for the electronic level @xmath21 is approximately given by @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , the factor @xmath20 appearing in @xmath23 , often neglected within the dipolar approximation , is due to the fact that the electronic wave function varies on a scale that is approximately determined by the bohr radius , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "considering that the electron moves in a finite space leads to an effective momentum cut - off for the emitted photons , @xmath24 , and thus introduces a maximum photonic frequency @xmath25 into the problem .    the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the photonic crystal light modes are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively for a mode of wavenumber @xmath28 and polarization @xmath29 .",
    "the above hamiltonian is not exactly solvable and the rwa is usually considered , so that the fast rotating terms ( i.e. terms @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) , are neglected with respect to the other ( energy conserving ) terms . in this case ,",
    "while the rwa is often a very good approximation , due to the existence of well separated time - scales , this is not always the case . in the case of strong coupling",
    ", we shall show that large deviations from rwa physics emerge , and that their description requires sophisticated numerical techniques .",
    "a single atom constitutes the simplest possible case , but represents a valuable example to prove the validity or our method . as noted above",
    ", when considering the rwa , the dynamics specified by the hamiltonian eq.([genh2 ] ) always remains in the one excitation sector and the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the total atom - photonic crystal system wave function can be solved exactly @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the wave function of the total system can be written as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 describes the atom excited and no photon in the radiation field , and @xmath35 represents no excitation in the atom , and a single photon in the mode @xmath36 .",
    "note that this form for the system wave function is valid only when the rwa is assumed , and the dynamics is restricted to the one excitation sector .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation projected on the one - atom sector of the hilbert space takes the form , @xmath37 inserting the formal solution of the second equation into the first one , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the correlation function of the system - environment coupling @xcite",
    ". we note that in order to calculate the correlation function , we have assumed that the factor @xmath40 changes very smoothly with @xmath6 in the 1bz ( first brillouin zone ) of the photonic crystal , and can be considered a constant factor in comparison with the rapidly oscillating exponential factor @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the validity of this approximation can be easily verified numerically , and it allows us to settle @xmath41 . here , we have considered in addition that the sum over the two polarization modes gives rise to a factor two .",
    "note that the high - frequency cut - off arising from the finite size of the electronic wave functions is required to avoid a singularity at the origin of time in the correlation function ( such singularity appears for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "a change of variable between @xmath28 and @xmath42 , leads to expressing the correlation function as @xmath43 , with the spectral density given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath46 can be obtained by taking the laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ oneatomsector3 ] ) and inverting the resulting expression for the laplace transform @xmath47 of @xmath46 . from eq .",
    "( [ oneatomsector3 ] ) we thus need to invert @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the laplace transform of @xmath50 .",
    "once determined , the population of the atom in the excited state at time @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "using the laplace transform method , a numerical solution for @xmath46 can always be obtained . in contrast , an analytical solution requires additional approximations , namely that the system frequencies are very small compared to the cut - off frequency @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 , and that all relevant time scales obey @xmath55 @xcite . under these conditions , this leads to @xmath56 , which is singular at the origin , but describes correctly times @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "inverting the laplace transform of @xmath47 with this approximation for @xmath50 , the following solution is obtained @xcite    @xmath58    with @xmath59 . defining @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we have three different regimes : ( i ) if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 , ( ii ) if @xmath64 , then @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and finally , ( iii ) if @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . under these conditions ,",
    "several dynamical regimes exist depending on the value of the parameter @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a frequency that arises from renormalisation of the optical transition by the environment , @xmath72 . like the lamb - shift encountered in traitional master equation approaches , @xmath73 depends on the coupling strength and",
    "is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and in section [ coherences ] . in this regard , for @xmath74",
    "the atom is not excited in the stationary state ( i.e. relaxes completely to the ground state ) , whereas for negative values of @xmath75 there is a stationary residual excited atomic population ( corresponding to a situation where the emitted photon remains localized nearby the atom ) .",
    "thus , tuning @xmath75 from negative to positive values leads to a cross - over between two distinct regimes @xcite .",
    "when the rwa is not applicable , the dynamics of the global atom - light system can not be described in the one - excitation manifold , and the direct wave function approach presented above becomes intractable .",
    "however , a new technique has recently emerged in the theory of open quantum systems which allow this task to be performed with numerical exactitude .",
    "this technique @xcite employs time - adaptive density matrix re - normalisation group ( t - dmrg ) algorithm to compute the evolution of the full atom and light field wavefunction .",
    "the t - dmrg algorithm enables extremely accurate simulation of large many - body systems with nearest - neighbour interactions in @xmath76 , and has become widely used in cold atom and condensed matter theory @xcite .    to apply this technique to the present problem , we start with the full atom - light field hamiltonian in the continuum schr \" odinger picture , @xmath77 where the field operators obey that @xmath78=\\delta(k - k')$ ] , @xmath79 is the atom - light coupling strength and @xmath80 is the dispersion of the photons .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 labels the modes and is normalised so that the highest frequency of the modes , that we will denote by @xmath81 , occurs at @xmath82 .",
    "when the environment is initially in a gaussian state , it is possible to integrate out the environment degrees of freedom and derive a formally - exact expression for the reduced state dynamics of the atomic system using path integral methods @xcite .",
    "importantly for the application of t - dmrg , this result shows that the effects of the photonic environment will only enter through the spectral function @xmath83 of the photons @xcite . in the following simulations",
    ", we assume that the initial state of the total atom and environment is a product state of an atomic state and the zero - temperature vacuum state of the light field .",
    "as we are only interested in the reduced state of the atom , we can make use of the fact that the only relevant environmental property is the spectral function to represent the bosonic environment in a form that allows us to transform it into an equivalent system suitable for tedopa simulation .    in terms of the continuum dispersion and coupling functions , the spectral function defined in eq .",
    "( [ spectralgap ] ) takes the general form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the inverse function of the dispersion @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath86 @xcite . from this one",
    "can see that a variety of different pairs of @xmath79 and @xmath80 can lead to the same spectral function , and we exploit this",
    ". taking @xmath87 and the linear dispersion @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the maximum frequency of the environment considered in the simulations , it can be found that the spectral function characteristic of ( [ hamil3 ] ) ( as described in @xcite ) is given by @xmath90 , where @xmath83 is the spectral function of eq.([spectralgap ] ) and @xmath91 is the heaviside function . as the dynamics of the reduced atomic state only depend on @xmath83 , the t - dmrg simulations ( with these choices of @xmath80 and @xmath79 ) simulate exactly the same reduced dynamics implied by eq .",
    "( [ genh2 ] ) with the physcial microscopic dispersions and coupling functions described in section [ model ] .",
    "because of the hard cut - off in the spectral function , dynamics are captured accurately on all frequency scales up to @xmath81 , which is chosen to be much larger than the physcial scale @xmath92 that determines the frequency range over which @xmath83 is significantly different from zero .",
    "therefore , by taking @xmath93 the t - dmrg describes all relevant physics beyond times of @xmath94 with numerical exactitude .",
    "we then perform a unitary transformation of the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ hamil3 ] ) by defining new environment modes @xmath95 , where @xmath96 are monic orthogonal polynomials which obey @xmath97 . by choosing a linear - in - k dispersion ,",
    "the properties of the monic orthogonal polynomials ensure that this transformation is both real orthogonal and leads to a nearest - neighbour chain hamiltonian given by @xcite , @xmath98 within this picture , the two level atom now couples to one end of a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the frequencies @xmath99 and couplings @xmath100 are simply determined by the recurrence coefficients of the monic orthogonal polynomials which are effectively determined by the spectral function ( in the language of orthogonal polynomials , the spectral function is treated as a weight function ) @xcite .",
    "the use of the theory of orthogonal polynomials also allows rigourous proof of this mapping for almost any physical spectral function , including continuous , discrete , mixed and gapped spectra @xcite .",
    "we also note more generally that this procedure effectively enables a highly efficient way of simulating one - dimensional quantum field dynamics coupled to non - linear objects , such as spins , and also other quantum fields .",
    "after this procedure it now becomes possible to apply time - adaptive density matrix renormalisation methods @xcite to simulate the unitary evolution of the total atom and chain wavefunction @xmath101 . from @xmath101 ,",
    "the real - time expectation of any observable @xmath102 of the atom can be simply calculated by evaluating @xmath103 .",
    "although we will not pursue this here , another advantage of this method is that we also have full access to the evolving state of the environment field itself",
    ". this can provide deep insight into real - time dissipative processes , as has been recently demonstrated in a study of exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes @xcite . the combination of the powerful analtyical mapping with the numerical strength of t - dmrg we shall henceforth refer to as the tedopa ( time evolving density with orthogonal polynomials algorithm ) technique , and a comprehensive overview of its theory , implementation and applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "while numerical simulations with t - dmrg can be made arbitrarily precise in principle , in practice finite bond - dimension employed in the simulation will limit precision .",
    "the numerical simulation error can be bounded from above but the resulting bounds are very conservative as they are growing in time . hence it is instructive to compare simulation results against know exact solutions .    to this end , we consider the rwa approximation and compare the results obtained using tedopa and the numerical solution of @xmath46 .",
    "as the analytical ( inverse laplace transform ) solution for @xmath46 discussed in the previous section is only valid when @xmath55 and @xmath54 , we use the piessens method @xcite to numerically invert the laplace transform of @xmath46 for the large but finite values of @xmath92 used in our tedopa calculations .",
    "in addition , it is possible to numerically integrate the rwa heisenberg equations of motion in the chain representation of eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) to obtain a numerically accurate evolution of the atomic population .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the population ( @xmath52 ) in the excited state of the atom for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , gap - edge frequency @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 calculated by t - dmrg , the piessens method and the numerical integration of the heisenberg equations .",
    "the figure shows that the t - dmrg result converges to both exact rwa results , while the inset shows that the finite system - size recurrence features which appear in the heisenberg integration scheme are reproduced almost exactly if the same number of sites are used in the t - dmrg simulation .",
    "we note that it is also possible to perform t - dmrg in the heisenberg picture , and that for the rwa example considered here it will be numerically accuarate @xcite .",
    "anticipating later results , which show that tedopa captures the non - rotating wave physics extremely well , we might also expect heisenberg t - dmrg to perform well in the non - rotating wave case @xcite .",
    "the slight departure between the t - dmrg and heisenberg method from the piessens method is due to the growing inaccuracy and instability of the piessens method ( a general feature of many numerical laplace inversion techniques ) as time evolves @xcite .",

    "thus , a question that remained open is whether this transition is a consequence of the rwa , or can also be observed in situations where the rwa is invalid . to explore this we now present results in the regime of strong coupling where we expect , and",

    "in general , the rwa overestimates the excited state stationary population for @xmath113 , and underestimates this quantity for @xmath114 , as seen for @xmath115 .",

    "( [ genh2 ] ) is simulated . a clear difference in the residual populations above the cross over is also observed .",
    "as we shall see , these differences arise due to the improper treatment of the renormalisation of the atomic transition energy in the rwa .",
    "however , at very weak coupling , these differences are negligible and the cross - over happens at @xmath117 ( not shown ) .",
    "we also note that a sharp ` transition ' at @xmath118 only appears as @xmath119 @xcite , and when the coupling is very weak .",
    "however one should also note that the cross - over width in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is over - emphasised by the logarithmic scale .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] also shows that the residual population in the excited state remains larger in the simulations of the full hamiltonian relative to results obtained within the rwa approximation .",

    "one may consider for instance photonic crystals with narrow band - widths @xmath169 , what would give rise to smaller cut - off frequencies @xmath170 .",
    "here we have considered the fact that the @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "strong system - environment coupling can also be achieved when strong collective effects produce an enhanced effective system - environment coupling @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation in which this enhancement can be achieved is by considering a collection of @xmath172 atoms uniformly interacting with the radiation field or environment , or similarly , when describing the collective coupling of a spin system to superconducting resonators @xcite . in this case , for a single excitation in the system ( i.e. only one atom in the ensemble is excited ) , the situation is completely analogous to the one described here , except for the fact that the coupling is enhanced by a factor @xmath173 in the photonic crystal case @xcite .",
    "thus , a value @xmath174 would be achieved if we have a high enough number of impurity atoms .",
    "of particular interest is also the multi - excitation regime for this configuration . a spontaneous polarization phenomenon , in which the atomic coherences grows from zero to a finite value ,",
    "is predicted to occur for atoms in photonic crystal - like environments , when the atomic frequencies are resonant with the band edge @xmath175 and when considering the semi - classical and rw approximations @xcite .",
    "the results in our work show strong differences in the behaviour of single atom coherences with and without considering the rwa , particularly for small @xmath176 , and suggest that applying the novel technique @xcite for treating the system - environment interaction in the analysis of multi - atomic systems will shed new light into this and other intriguing collective phenomena .",
    "other possible enhancement factors for the coupling coefficient would involve placing the atom within a photonic crystal cavity @xcite . in a more general scenario ,",
    "one may consider a situation where the effective system - environment interaction , characterised by @xmath177 in our chain representation of the system , is larger than the typical frequencies of the light field , @xmath178 .",
    "as we have shown , in this regime the ground and excited atomic states are entangled with the light field through polaronic correlations , and these are very similar to the shifted vacuum states which appear in the recent theory of _ ultrastrong coupling _ in quantum wells and circuit qed where this regime can be realised @xcite . in conclusion , this work has demonstrated that our tedopa method for the treatment of system environment interaction has allowed us to reveal strong deviations between the exact and approximate solutions in physical models of practical importance , and hence suggests its use in a wide variety of settings where non - perturbative system environment interactions are expected to play a role .",
