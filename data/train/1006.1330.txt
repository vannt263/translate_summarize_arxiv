    "electron transport in graphene remains a field of intense experimental and theoretical activity @xcite .",
    "the hallmark of graphene is the massless dirac character of low - energy electron excitations .",
    "this gives rise to remarkable physical properties of this system distinguishing it from conventional two - dimensional metals .",
    "the most remarkable effects arise when the chemical potential is located in a close vicinity of the neutrality ( dirac ) point . in particular , a short - and - wide sample ( with width @xmath0 much exceeding the length @xmath1 ) of clean graphene exhibits at the dirac point pseudo - diffusive charge transport , @xcite with `` conductivity '' @xmath2 and with counting statistics ( characterizing fluctuations of current ) equivalent to that of a diffusive wire . @xcite in particular , the fano factor ( the shot noise power divided by the current ) takes the universal value @xmath3 that coincides with the well - known result for a diffusive metallic wire .",
    "@xcite this is at odds with usual clean metallic systems , where the conductance ( rather than conductivity ) is independent of @xmath1 and the shot noise is absent ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the reason behind these remarkable peculiarities of transport in clean graphene at the dirac point is linearly vanishing density of states .",
    "this implies that the current is mediated by evanescent rather than propagating modes .",
    "the above theoretical predictions have been confirmed in measurements of conductance and noise in ballistic graphene flakes .",
    "@xcite recent advances in preparation and transport studies of suspended graphene samples also indicate that the system may be in the ballistic regime .",
    "@xcite    effects of impurities on transport properties of graphene are highly unusual as well .",
    "in contrast to conventional metals , ballistic graphene near the dirac point conducts better when potential impurities are added.@xcite quantum interference in disordered graphene is also highly peculiar due to the dirac nature of the carriers .",
    "in particular , in the absence of intervalley scattering , the minimal conductivity@xcite @xmath5 is `` topologically protected '' from quantum localization .",
    "@xcite the exact value of the conductivity of such a system at the dirac point depends on the type of intravalley scattering ( random scalar or vector potential , or random mass , or their combination ) . for the case of random potential only ( which is experimentally realized by charged scatterers ) the conductivity in fact increases logarithmically with the length @xmath1 , in view of antilocalization .",
    "@xcite    in our previous work@xcite , we have studied the evolution of conductance of a short - and - wide graphene sample from the ballistic to the diffusive regime .",
    "we have also shown that the leading disorder - induced correction to the noise and full counting statistics in the ballistic regime is completely governed by the renormalization of the conductance .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the fano factor @xmath6 remains unaffected to this order .",
    "indeed , the experiments@xcite give fano factor values in the vicinity of 1/3 at the dirac point for different system lengths @xmath1 .",
    "one could thus ask whether deviations from this value should be expected at all .    in this work we present a detailed analysis of the shot noise and the full counting statistics in samples with long - range ( no valley mixing ) disorder .",
    "we show that to second order in the disorder strength a correction to the universal counting statistics of the ballistic graphene does arise .",
    "we calculate this correction and demonstrate that it suppresses the fano factor below the value 1/3 . for the case of random scalar potential , we also analyze the opposite limit of large @xmath1 when the system is deep in the diffusive regime . generalizing the analysis of weak - localization effects on the counting statistics by nazarov@xcite",
    ", we find that the fano factor returns to the value of 1/3 from below with increasing @xmath1 .",
