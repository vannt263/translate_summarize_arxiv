    "galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) show various states characterized by their spectral shapes , temporal properties , and luminosities .",
    "they mostly take two major states , the `` low / hard state '' and the `` high / soft state '' , which are referred to as `` the hard x - ray state '' and `` the thermal dominant state '' , respectively , in more recent classification ( see @xcite and references therein ) since the state of a bhc is not always determined by an x - ray luminosity alone . in the low / hard state ,",
    "the x - ray energy spectra are dominated by a power - law component with a photon index of @xmath01.7 and a high energy cutoff at @xmath0100 kev that shows strong short - time variability @xcite .",
    "they can be explained by thermal comptonization of soft photons from the accretion disk by hot plasmas with a temperature of @xmath010@xmath8 k ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in a typical outburst of a transient bhc",
    ", it generally exhibits a spectral transition from the low / hard to the high / soft state through the intermediate ( or very high ) state when the luminosity reaches @xmath010% of the eddingtion limit .",
    "the x - ray spectra in the high / soft state are characterized by a ultra - soft component which is considered to originate from an optically - thick and geometrically - thin accretion disk ( so called `` standard disk '' ; @xcite ) .",
    "this emission can be successfully described by the multi - color disk ( mcd ) model ( @xcite , @xcite ) with the innermost temperature of @xmath01 kev .",
    "an important signature in the high / soft state is that the innermost radius ( @xmath9 ) of the accretion disk is kept constant , independent of the flux or innermost disk temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is believed that the @xmath9 reflects the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , which is determined through general relativity by the mass and angular momentum of the black hole ; the radius of isco for a non - spinning black hole is 6@xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the gravitational radius , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the gravitational constant , black hole mass , and light velocity , respectively ) . by assuming that the obtained innermost @xmath9 to the isco , the black hole mass can be estimated from the x - ray spectrum alone for a given spin parameter .",
    "xte  j1752223 was first discovered with the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on 2009 october 23 ( mjd 55127 ) during a galactic bulge scan observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gas slit camera ( gsc ) onboard monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ; @xcite ) detected the source simultaneously @xcite .",
    "as described in ( 2010 ; hereafter paper i ) , maxi continuously monitored the source during the entire outburst until 2010 june . the maxi light curves and",
    "hardness - intensity diagram revealed that the source initially stayed in the low / hard states with two stable flux levels for about three months , and then moved into the high / soft state ( paper i ) .",
    "a radio flare was detected simultaneously with the spectral transition ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the proper motion of the jet ejecta was later found with vlbi observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite identified it as an approaching jet ejected coincidently with the x - ray state transition . from the observed flux of the approaching jet and its upper limit of the receding one , they constrained the jet speed and the inclination angle from the line - of - sight to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , by assuming that the axes of the twin jets are aligned .",
    "@xcite estimated the black hole mass and distance to be 9.6@xmath40.9 @xmath5 and 3.5@xmath40.4 kpc , respectively , using the spectral - timing correlation technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the compact object mass has not been estimated via optical mass - function technique . to firmly establish the nature of xte  j1752223",
    ", however , it is quite important to constrain the black hole mass by an independent approach .    in this paper , we present the results from a detailed spectral analysis of xte  j1752223 utilizing the maxi / gsc data , together with those of swift / xrt and suzaku , mainly focusing on the spectra in the high / soft state .",
    "we then discuss the constraints on the black hole mass and distance based on our results . in the appendix ,",
    "we present the current status of spectral calibration of the maxi / gsc using the crab nebula , which is fully reflected in this paper and in a similar work for the black hole candidate gx 3394 reported by @xcite .",
    "the spectral fitting was carried out on xspec version 12.6 .",
    "errors are quoted at statistical 90% confidence limits for a single parameter throughout the paper .",
    "as the first astronomical mission on the international space station ( iss ) , maxi has been operating since 2009 august .",
    "the payload carries two kinds of x - ray all - sky monitors ; the gas - slit camera ( gsc ; @xcite ) and the solid - state slit camera ( ssc ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the gsc consists of xe - gas proportional counters for the x - ray detector and slat collimators with a slit to localize the direction of the incident x - rays .",
    "the counters employ resistive - carbon wires for detector anodes to determine the x - ray position along the anode wire",
    ". twelve identical units ( refereed to as gsc_0 , ... , gsc_9 , gsc_a and gsc_b ) are assembled so that they instantaneously cover two rectangular field of views ( fovs ) of 3@xmath17160 deg@xmath18 with an equal area .",
    "after the operation started in 2009 august , two counters , gsc_6 and gsc_9 were stopped on 2009 september 8 and 14 , respectively , for high - voltage breakdown .",
    "other two counters on gsc_a and gsc_b were stopped temporarily on september 23 , because diagnostic data indicated that they may also break down rather soon .",
    "consequently , the outburst of xte j1752223 from 2009 october to 2010 june was covered by eight gsc camera units out of the twelve .",
    "the gsc fov is limited by slats collimators .",
    "the visibility for a target at a given sky position changes according to the iss orbital motion ; hereafter we call the visibility time as `` transit '' .",
    "each transit lasts for 40 - 150 s , and the effective area of each gsc counter change due to the triangular - shaped collimator transmission function , with a peak value of 4 - 5 cm@xmath18 .",
    "the maxi / gsc scanned the direction of xte  j1752223 2041 times in total from the discovery on 2009 october 23 ( mjd 55127 ) to 2010 june 3 ( mjd 55350 ) .",
    "the total exposure times effective area becomes 534.8 cm@xmath18 ksec .      for the data analysis",
    ", we used the maxi specific analysis tools , which were developed by the maxi team .",
    "we analyzed the gsc event data version 0.3b , which include the data taken by counters operated at the nominal high voltage ( = 1650 v ) but excluding those of anode # 1 and # 2 whose energy responses have not been enough calibrated yet .",
    "we discarded events taken while the gsc fovs were interfered by the solar panels and other iss payloads .",
    "the events detected at the anode - end area were also screened since the background is higher therein .",
    "these event were cut with a condition that the photon incident angle ( @xmath20 ; see @xcite for the definition ) is higher than 36@xmath7 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : contour_region ] we carefully extracted events for source and background from circular regions with a 1.5@xmath7 radius , excluding regions within 1.7@xmath7 of nearby sources , gx 51 , gx 9 + 1 and sax j1748.92021 in ngc 6440 .",
    "we used only those data when the source and background regions were both fully scanned in a transit .",
    "we performed spectral analysis of the data taken between mjd=55200 and mjd=55293 , during which both the `` hard - to - soft '' and `` soft - to - hard '' transitions took place ( paper i ) .",
    "the net effective exposure was 194.5 cm@xmath18 ksec for 752 transits .",
    "we divided the whole dataset into groups with typical lengths of a few days so that the spectrum in each group has enough photon statistics , except for the epoch around the `` hard - to - soft '' state transition when the spectrum changed rapidly .",
    "eventually , data were separated into 49 groups whose exposures times effective area were 0.2@xmath012 cm@xmath18 ksec .",
    "the energy response matrix for each group was calculated by the response builder ( @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of the energy response was verified using the crab nebula ( see appendix ) .",

    "they are updated from those presented in paper i , after applying the latest calibration and the same data screening as used for the spectral analysis ( section  [ subsec - spec ] and appendix ) .",
    "the maxi / gsc first detected xte  j1752223 at 15:05 ( ut ) on 2009 october 23 ( mjd 55127 ) when the 220 kev x - ray intensity was 30 mcrab .",
    "it monitored the source almost uniformly except for the time when the fov was close to the sun ( mjd 5515455159 and mjd 5517255188 ) and when poles of the scanning axis was close to the source ( around mjd 55300 ) .",
    "the light curves reveal that the source stayed in the initial low / hard state for the extraordinary long period of about 3 months , and took two flux - plateau phases meantime ( paper i ) .",
    "the `` hard - to - soft '' state transition occurred on mjd 55218 and the following behavior agrees well with those of the typical bhc outbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray intensity was peaked at 420 mcrab on 2010 january 22 ( mjd 55218 ) , then decayed exponentially with an e - folding time of 34 days through the high / soft state .",
    "the `` soft - to - hard '' transition started on 2010 march 30 ( mjd 55285 ) , and then the source returned to the low / hard state on 2010 april 6 ( mjd 55292 ) . on 2010",
    "june 28 ( mjd 55375 ) , the source flux fell below the maxi / gsc detection sensitivity per day ( 20 mcrab ) .",
    "thus , the total duration of the outburst became about eight months .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we employed the standard model for bhcs in the high / soft state , a multi - color disk ( mcd ; _ diskbb _ in xspec ) model plus a power - law representing the hard tail .",

    "j1752223 was fixed at 0.6@xmath1710@xmath22 @xmath23 , based on the swift and suzaku results as described below .",
    "the model has four parameters : the innermost temperature @xmath24 and innermost radius @xmath9=@xmath25 @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the normalization of the _ diskbb _ model .",
    "the distance to the source of @xmath28 kpc and inclination angle @xmath3=0 are assumed .",
    "] for the mcd component , with the photon index @xmath29 and normalization at 1 kev for the power - law component .",
    "we first applied the model to all the data . when the mcd component was found to be not necessary ( i.e. , the 90% confidence range of the mcd normalization contains zero ) , only the power - law model was applied with its @xmath29 set free .",
    "when the mcd component was required , we fixed @xmath30 for all the spectra because it is often difficult to determine from individual spectrum due to poor statistics and the limited energy coverage of the maxi / gsc .",
    "this photon index corresponds to a typical value obtained when the power - law component is relatively strong ( @xmath3150% of the total flux in the 220 kev band ) .",
    "although @xcite suggest from the rxte / pca data that the power - law slope is variable between @xmath32 by using a spectral model different from ours , we confirmed that varying @xmath29 value within this range only changes the best - fit mcd normalization by @xmath33 , and hence does not affect our conclusions .",

    "the mcd component then appeared after mjd 55216.65 ( dataid = 13 ) and lasted until mjd 55286 ( dataid = 46 ) , although the power - law flux was dominant mjd 55216.6555218.37 and on mjd 55286.97 in the 2 - 20 kev band .",
    "the mcd flux reached to a peak of @xmath01@xmath1710@xmath98erg s@xmath99 @xmath23 on 2010 january 23 ( mjd 55219 ) , and then decreased .",

    "based on these results , we identify that the source was likely in the low / hard state before mjd 55214 , the intermediate state over mjd 5521555218 , the high / soft state over mjd 5521955282 , and then came back to the low / hard state after mjd 55292 through the intermediate state between mjd 55285 and 55292 . for later discussions ,",
    "we calculate the weighted average of @xmath9 in the high / soft state to be 41.0@xmath42.1 km , using the observations on mjd 5523055282 when the contribution of the power - law component was sufficiently small .",
    "as @xcite pointed out the initial variation of @xmath9 observed on mjd 5521655218 in the intermediate state may be caused by the ignoring of comptonized photons in the calculation of @xmath9 . in these epochs ,",
    "the fraction of the power - law component was @xmath3150% of the total x - ray flux in the 2 - 20 kev band , and hence the compton up - scattering of the disk blackbody emission can significantly reduce the normalization of the direct mcd component ( @xcite ) .",

    "from 2009 october 25 to 2010 july 29 , the swift / xrt ( @xcite ) carried out 67 pointing observations of xte  j1752223 in the windowed timing ( wt ) mode . due to the sun angle constraint",

    "all the xrt spectra and light curves were produced by the web interface ( @xcite ) supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",
    "we used the xrt response matrix file for the wt mode version 12 .",
    "all the 17 observations with an exposure time of a few ksec each were analyzed independently .",
    "first results of the swift / xrt spectral analysis were already reported by @xcite .",
    "they employed the same mcd plus power - law model as we used in the maxi / gsc analyses , but derived a different result that the innermost radius changed significantly with time .",
    "the difference is considered to come from the fact that they left the power - law index free and obtained a wide range of @xmath29 between @xmath00 and @xmath03 , even though this quantity is not constrained when the mcd component is strong .",
    "hence we reanalyzed the xrt spectra by fixing @xmath29 at 2.2 , the same value as adopted for the maxi / gsc spectra .",
    "the @xmath21 was left free because the swift / xrt is sensitive down to @xmath00.3 kev .",
