    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) play an important role in astrophysics , especially in the study of cosmic evolution .",
    "they have been applied successfully in determining cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * @xmath2 * and * @xmath3 * ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are also a key part of our understanding of galactic chemical evolution owing to the main contribution of iron to their host galaxies .",
    "it is generally believed that sne ia are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co wds ) in binaries . however , there is still no agreement on the nature of their progenitors [ 3@xmath46 ] , and no sn ia progenitor system before the explosion has been conclusively identified [ 7@xmath49 ] .    over the past few decades ,",
    "two families of sn ia progenitor models have been proposed , i.e. , the double - degenerate ( dd ) and single - degenerate ( sd ) models .",
    "of these two models , the sd model is widely accepted at present .",
    "it is suggested that the dd model , which involves the merger of two co wds [ 10@xmath412 ] , likely leads to an accretion - induced collapse rather than to an sn ia @xcite .",
    "for the sd model , the companion could be a main - sequence ( ms ) star or a slightly evolved subgiant star ( wd + ms channel ) , or a red - giant star ( wd + rg channel ) [ 14@xmath426 ] .",
    "observationally , there is increasing evidence indicating that at least some sne ia may come from the sd model [ 27@xmath430 ] .",
    "meanwhile , a co wd may also accrete material from a he star to increase its mass to the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass , which is known as the he star donor channel .",
    "yoon and langer @xcite followed the evolution of a co wd + he star system , in which the wd can increase its mass to the ch mass by accreting material from the he star .",
    "it is believed that wd + he star systems are generally originated from intermediate mass binaries , which may explain sne ia with short delay times implied by recent observations [ 32@xmath435 ] .    in this contribution",
    ", we aim to investigate sn ia birthrates and delay times of the he star donor channel and to explore the properties of the surviving companions after sn explosion . in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the numerical code for the binary evolution calculations and the binary evolutionary results .",
    "we describe the binary population synthesis ( bps ) method and results in sect .",
    "3 . finally , a discussion is given in sect .",
    "and @xmath5@xmath6 . ( from wang et al .",
    "@xcite),width=245 ]    we use eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite to calculate the binary evolutions of wd + he star systems . the code has been updated with the latest input physics over the past three decades @xcite .",
    "roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is treated within the code described by han et al .",
    "we set the ratio of mixing length to local pressure scale height , @xmath7 , to be 2.0 .",
    "the opacity tables are compiled by chen and tout @xcite . in our calculations , he star models are composed by he abundance @xmath8 and metallicity @xmath9 . instead of solving stellar structure equations of a wd , we use the optically thick wind model @xcite and adopt the prescription of kato & hachisu @xcite for the mass accumulation efficiency of he - shell flashes onto the wd .",
    "we have calculated about 2600 wd + he star systems , and obtain a large , dense model grid ( for details see @xcite ) . in fig . 1 , we show the contours at the onset of rlof for producing sne ia in the @xmath10 plane for various wd masses ( i.e. , @xmath11 = 0.865 , 0.90 , 1.0 , 1.1 and @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the orbital period and the mass of the he companion star at the onset of rlof , respectively .",
    "the region almost vanishes for @xmath15=0.865@xmath6 , which is then assumed to be the minimum wd mass for producing sne ia from this channel .",
    "if the parameters of a wd + he star system at the onset of the rlof are located in the contours , an sn ia is then assumed to be produced .",
    "thus , these contours can be expediently used in bps studies to investigate the he star donor channel of sne ia .",

    "figs 3 and 4 shows the distributions of the masses , the orbital velocities , the effective temperatures , the surface gravities , the orbital period and the equatorial rotational velocity of companions at the moment of sn explosion ( for the detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "these distributions may be helpful for identifying the surviving companions of sne ia .",
    "the simulation also shows the initial parameters of the primordial binaries and the wd + he star systems that lead to sne ia , which may help to search for potential sn ia progenitors .    .",
    "( from wang & han @xcite),width=321 ]    in fig . 5 , we show the current epoch distribution of the spatial velocity for the surviving companions from this channel ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we see that the surviving companions have high spatial velocities ( @xmath1400km / s ) , which almost exceed the gravitational pull of the galaxy nearby the sun .",
    "thus , the surviving companions from the sn explosion scenario could be an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) , which are stars with a velocity so great that they are able to escape the gravitational pull of the galaxy .",
    "the simulations give galactic sn ia birthrate of @xmath0@xmath35 for the he star donor channel , which is lower than that inferred observationally ( i.e. , @xmath36 ; cappellaro and turatto @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the he star donor channel is only a subclass of sn ia production , and there may be some other channels or mechanisms also contributing to sne ia , e.g. , wd + ms channel , wd + rg channel or double - degenerate channel ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hachisu et al .",
    "@xcite recently studied the mass - stripping effect on a ms or slightly evolved companion star by winds from a mass - accreting wd .",
    "the model can also provide a possible ways of producing young sne ia , but the model depends on the efficiency of the mass - stripping effect .",
    "we also find that the model produces very few young sne ia according to a detailed bps approach .",
    "thus , we consider the he star donor channel as a main contribution to the formation of young sne ia .    based on the optically thick wind assumption , wang & han @xcite recently calculated about 10 000 wd + he star systems and obtained sn ia production regions of the he star donor channel with different metallicities . for a constant star - formation galaxy , they found that sn ia birthrates increase with metallicity .",
    "if a single starburst is assumed , sne ia occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birthrate is larger for a high @xmath37",
    ". we also note that liu et al .",
    "@xcite recently investigated the effects of rapid differential rotation on the accreting wd , and found that the highest mass of the accreting wd at the moment of sn ia explosion is @xmath38 for the he star donor channel , which may provide a way for the formation of super - ch mass sne ia in the observations .",
    "massive wd + he star systems are candidates of sn ia progenitors .",
    "hd 49798/rx j0648.0 - 4418 is an evidence of the existence of massive wd + he star systems .",
    "based on the data from the xmm - newton satellite , mereghetti et al .",
    "@xcite recently derived the masses of the two components .",
    "the corresponding masses are 1.50@xmath390.05@xmath40 for hd 49798 and 1.28@xmath390.05@xmath40 for the wd . according to a detailed binary evolution model",
    ", wang & han @xcite found that the massive wd can increase its mass to the ch mass in future evolution ( see fig .",
    "thus , hd 49798 with its wd companion is a likely candidate of sn ia progenitors .",
    "v445 pup is another candidate of massive wd + he star system , in which the mass of the wd is more than @xmath41 , and the mass of the he star is more than @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however , we still do not know the orbital period of the binary system and the mass of the he donor star so far .",
    "this needs further observations of v445 pup after the dense dust shell disappears .    us",
    "708 is an extremely he - rich sdo star in the galaxy halo , with a heliocentric radial velocity of + @xmath43@xmath44 ( hirsch et al .",
    "we note that the local velocity relative to the galatic center may lead to a higher observation velocity for the surviving companions , but this may also lead to a lower observation velocity . considering the local velocity nearby the sun ( @xmath0220km / s )",
    ", we find that @xmath030% of the surviving companions may be observed to have velocity @xmath45 for a given sn ejecta velocity 13500km / s .",
    "in addition , the asymmetric explosion of sne ia may also enhance the velocity of the surviving companions .",
    "thus , a surviving companion in the he star donor channel may have a high velocity like us 708 .",
    "in future investigations , we will employ the large sky area multi - object fiber spectral telescope ( lamost ) to search the hvss originating from the surviving companions of sne ia .",
