    "the weinstein conjecture asserts that certain vector fields must have closed orbits . before stating the conjecture at the end of this section , we first outline its origins .",
    "this is discussion is only semi - historical , because only a sample of the relevant works will be cited , and not always in chronological order .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed manifold ( in this article all manifolds and all objects defined on them are smooth unless otherwise stated ) , and let @xmath1 be a vector field on @xmath0 .",
    "a _ closed orbit _ of @xmath1 is a map @xmath2 for some @xmath3 , satisfying the ordinary differential equation @xmath4    given a closed manifold @xmath0 , one can ask : does every vector field on @xmath0 have a closed orbit ? if the euler characteristic @xmath5 , then by the poincar - hopf index theorem every vector field on @xmath0 has zeroes , which give rise to constant closed orbits . in this article",
    "we will mainly focus on the case where @xmath0 is three - dimensional .",
    "then @xmath6 , which implies that the signed count of zeroes of a generic vector field is zero ; and it is relatively easy to cancel these in order to construct a vector field on @xmath0 with no zeroes .",
    "but understanding nonconstant closed orbits is much harder .",
    "although for some special three - manifolds such as the 3-torus it is easy to construct vector fields with no closed orbit , already for @xmath7 the question of whether all vector fields have closed orbits is very difficult .",
    "it turns out that the answer is no .",
    "examples of vector fields on @xmath8 with no closed orbit , with increasing degrees of regularity , were constructed by p.  schweizer ( @xmath9 ) , j.  harrison ( @xmath10 ) , k.  kuperberg ( @xmath11 ) , g.  kuperberg and k.  kuperberg ( real analytic ) , and g.  kuperberg ( @xmath9 and volume preserving ) , see @xcite . moreover , as explained in @xcite , such vector fields exist on any 3-manifold .",
    "the constructions of these examples involve modifying a given vector field by inserting a suitable `` plug '' in a neighborhood of a point on a closed orbit , which destroys that closed orbit without creating new ones .",
    "the fact that one can do this indicates that to gain any control over closed orbits , one needs to make some additional assumption on the vector field .      a very important class of vector fields , originating in classical mechanics ,",
    "are hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "we briefly recall the definition of these .",
    "let @xmath12 be a symplectic manifold .",
    "this means that @xmath13 is a closed @xmath14-form on @xmath15 such that @xmath16 everywhere , or equivalently @xmath13 defines a nondegenerate bilinear form on the tangent space @xmath17 at each point @xmath18 .",
    "the basic example of a symplectic manifold is @xmath19 with coordinates @xmath20 and the standard symplectic form @xmath21 we will drop the subscript ` @xmath22 ' when it is understood .",
    "darboux s theorem asserts that any symplectic manifold @xmath12 is locally equivalent to @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath18 there exists a neighborhood @xmath24 of @xmath25 in @xmath15 , an open set @xmath26 , and a symplectomorphism @xmath27 , ie a diffeomorphism @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a smooth function , the associated _ hamiltonian vector field _ is the vector field @xmath31 on @xmath15 characterized by @xmath32 the vector field @xmath31 exists and is unique by the nondegeneracy of @xmath13 .",
    "for example , if @xmath33 with the standard symplectic form , then @xmath34 so a trajectory @xmath35 of the vector field @xmath31 satisfies the equations @xmath36 these are the equations of classical mechanics , where the @xmath37 s are position coordinates , the @xmath38 s are momentum coordinates , and @xmath39 is the hamiltonian , or energy function .",
    "conservation of energy in classical mechanics translates to the fact that on a general symplectic manifold , the flow of @xmath31 preserves @xmath39 , because @xmath40 therefore if @xmath41 is a regular value of @xmath39 , then the level set @xmath42 is a @xmath43-dimensional submanifold of @xmath15 , which we will call a `` regular level set '' , and @xmath31 is a smooth vector field on it .",
    "must the hamiltonian vector field @xmath31 have a closed orbit on every regular level set ?",
    "it turns out that under favorable circumstances the answer is `` almost every '' .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath33 with the standard symplectic form .",
    "then one has the following :    [ thm : aee ] let @xmath44 be a proper smooth function .",
    "then the vector field @xmath31 has a closed orbit on @xmath42 for almost every @xmath41 such that @xmath45 .",
    "the original proof , see the exposition in @xcite , uses variational methods to find critical points of the `` symplectic action '' functional on the loop space , which are the desired closed orbits .",
    "using floer theory for the symplectic action functional ( different versions of floer theory will be introduced later in this article ) , this result can be extended to some other symplectic manifolds ; for a survey of some of these developments see @xcite .",
    "however there are some symplectic manifolds to which this theorem does not extend . to give a simple example due to zehnder @xcite , consider the 4-torus @xmath46 with coordinates @xmath47 and the nonstandard symplectic form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an irrational constant .",
    "if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 since @xmath49 is irrational , this vector field has no closed orbits except where @xmath52 .",
    "thus no regular level set of @xmath39 contains a closed orbit of @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the word `` almost '' can not be removed from theorem  [ thm : aee ] .",
    "namely , ginzburg - grel @xcite proved that there is a proper @xmath10 hamiltonian @xmath39 on @xmath53 with a regular level set on which the vector field @xmath31 has no closed orbit .",
    "moreover @xmath11 examples are known in @xmath19 for @xmath54 , see the references in @xcite .",
    "so even for hamiltonian vector fields on @xmath19 one needs a further assumption to guarantee the existence of closed orbits .      to see what kind of assumption might be appropriate , let @xmath0 be a hypersurface in a symplectic manifold @xmath55 which is a regular level set of a hamiltonian @xmath30",
    "observe that the existence of a closed orbit of @xmath31 on @xmath0 depends only on the hypersurface @xmath0 and not on the hamiltonian @xmath39 .",
    "for suppose @xmath56 is another hamiltonian which also has @xmath0 as a regular level set .",
    "then @xmath57 for some nonvanishing function @xmath58 , so @xmath59 on @xmath0 .",
    "thus the periodic orbits of @xmath60 and @xmath31 on @xmath0 differ only in their parametrizations .",
    "in fact one can describe the existence problem for periodic orbits on @xmath0 without referring to a hamiltonian at all by noting that the hamiltonian vector field on @xmath0 always lives in the rank @xmath61 subbundle @xmath62 called the _",
    "charateristic foliation_. thus the existence of a closed orbit on @xmath0 for any hamiltonian having it as a regular level set is equivalent to the existence of a closed curve tangent to @xmath63 , sometimes called a _",
    "closed characteristic_.    under what circumstances must a hypersurface in a symplectic manifold have a closed characteristic ? in the late 1970 s ,",
    "weinstein @xcite showed that in @xmath19 with the standard symplectic form , if @xmath0 is a convex compact hypersurface , then @xmath0 has a closed characteristic .",
    "rabinowitz @xcite showed that the above statement holds with `` convex '' replaced by `` star - shaped '' , meaning transverse to the radial vector field @xmath64 now the existence of a closed characteristic is invariant under symplectomorphisms of @xmath19 , while the star - shaped condition is not .",
    "this suggests that one should look for a more general , symplectomorphism invariant condition on the hypersurface @xmath0 that might guarantee the existence of a closed characteristic .",
    "weinstein @xcite proposed such a condition as follows .",
    "a hypersurface @xmath0 in a symplectic manifold @xmath55 is of _ contact type _ if there is a 1-form @xmath65 on @xmath0 such that @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for all nonzero @xmath68 .",
    "this condition is clearly invariant under symplectomorphisms of @xmath55 .    if @xmath0 is a star - shaped hypersurface in @xmath19 , then @xmath0 is of contact type , because one can take @xmath69 to see why @xmath67 for nonzero @xmath70 , note that nondegeneracy of @xmath13 implies that @xmath71 for any vector @xmath72 transverse to @xmath0 .",
    "the star - shaped condition says that @xmath73 is transverse to @xmath0 , so @xmath74 ; on the other hand it follows from the above formulas that @xmath75 .",
    "more generally , a _ liouville vector field _ on a symplectic manifold @xmath55 is a vector field @xmath73 such that the lie derivative @xmath76 .",
    "the radial vector field is an example of a liouville vector field .",
    "it turns out that a hypersurface @xmath0 in @xmath55 is of contact type if and only if there exists a liouville vector field defined in a neighborhood of @xmath0 which is transverse to @xmath0 , see eg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.3.58 ) .",
    "in particular , given such a vector field @xmath73 , the contact type condition is fulfilled by @xmath77 .",
    "one could now conjecture that if @xmath0 is a compact hypersurface of contact type in a symplectic manifold @xmath55 , then @xmath0 has a closed characteristic .",
    "this is essentially what weinstein conjectured in @xcite .",
    "in fact one can remove the symplectic manifold @xmath55 from the discussion as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be an oriented manifold of dimension @xmath78 .",
    "a _ contact form _ on @xmath0 is a @xmath61-form @xmath65 on @xmath0 such that @xmath79 everywhere .",
    "a contact form @xmath65 determines a vector field @xmath80 on @xmath0 , called the _ reeb vector field _ , characterized by @xmath81    in the definition of a contact type hypersurface , one can replace the condition `` @xmath67 for all nonzero @xmath70 '' by the condition `` @xmath65 is a contact form '' .",
    "note that for such a contact form , the associated reeb vector field is tangent to the characteristic foliation @xmath63 .",
    "conversely , any manifold with a contact form @xmath82 arises as a hypersurface of contact type in an associated symplectic manifold .",
    "namely , the _ symplectization _ of @xmath82 is the manifold @xmath83 with the symplectic form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes the @xmath86 coordinate .",
    "the slice @xmath87 is a hypersurface of contact type in @xmath83 , with @xmath65 fulfilling the definition of contact type .    in conclusion ,",
    "the conjecture at the end of  [ sec : oswc ] is equivalent to the following :    let @xmath0 be a closed oriented odd - dimensional manifold with a contact form @xmath65 .",
    "then the associated reeb vector field @xmath80 has a closed orbit .",
    "the eventual goal of this article is to explain taubes s proof of the weinstein conjecture in dimension three :    if @xmath0 is a closed oriented three - manifold with a contact form , then the associated reeb vector field has a closed orbit .      before starting on the long story which follows ,",
    "let us briefly comment on what is involved in taubes s proof , and the history leading up to it .",
    "first of all , as we will see in  [ sec : basicexamples ] ,  [ sec : cs3d ] , and  [ sec : cch ] below , methods from symplectic geometry have been used since the 1980 s to prove the weinstein conjecture in many cases , in both 3 and higher dimensions .",
    "but it is not currently known if such methods can be used to prove it in all cases .",
    "taubes s proof instead uses seiberg - witten theory . as we describe in  [ sec : bigpicture ] , the proof uses part of a 3-dimensional version of taubes s `` seiberg - witten = gromov '' ( sw = gr ) theorem .",
    "the sw = gr theorem relates seiberg - witten invariants of symplectic 4-manifolds to counts of holomorphic curves .",
    "its 3-dimensional counterpart relates seiberg - witten theory of a 3-manifold with a contact form to closed orbits of the reeb vector field ( and holomorphic curves in the 3-manifold cross @xmath86 ) .",
    "the sw = gr theorem was proved in the 1990 s , and one might wonder why the 3-dimensional weinstein conjecture was not also proved around that time using similar methods .",
    "part of what was missing was a sufficient development of seiberg - witten floer homology , the 3-dimensional counterpart of seiberg - witten invariants of 4-manifolds , which has since been provided by kronheimer - mrowka .",
    "in particular kronheimer - mrowka proved a nontriviality result for seiberg - witten floer homology , which is the key input on the seiberg - witten side in the proof of the weinstein conjecture .",
    "finally , as we explain in  [ sec : otp ] , the 3-dimensional analogue of sw = gr is not just a straightforward adaptation of the 4-dimensional story , but rather involves some nontrivial new ingredients , for example a new result of taubes estimating the spectral flow of families of dirac operators in terms of the chern - simons functional .    what follows now is a somewhat leisurely tour , gradually working towards the above . the impatient reader may wish to skip ahead to  [ sec : bigpicture ] for an overview of the big picture surrounding taubes s proof , or to  [ sec : otp ] for an outline of the proof itself .",
    "below , to save space , we usually say `` reeb orbit '' instead of `` closed orbit of the reeb vector field '' . two reeb orbits",
    "@xmath88 are considered equivalent if they differ by reparametrization , ie precomposition with a translation of @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 is a reeb orbit and @xmath91 is a positive integer , then the @xmath91-fold _ iterate _ of @xmath92 is the pullback of @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "a reeb orbit @xmath92 is embedded if and only if it is not the @xmath91-fold iterate of another reeb orbit where @xmath94 .",
    "the weinstein conjecture for compact hypersurfaces of contact type in @xmath19 was proved in 1987 by viterbo @xcite .",
    "in fact the almost - existence result in theorem  [ thm : aee ] is a generalization of this . to see why ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact hypersurface in @xmath19 of contact type . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : oswc ] , there exists a liouville vector field @xmath73 defined on a neighborhood of @xmath0 which is transverse to @xmath0 .",
    "flowing the hypersurface @xmath0 along the vector field @xmath73 for a small time @xmath49 gives another hypersurface @xmath95 and a diffeomorphism @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath73 is transverse to @xmath0 , there exists @xmath97 such that the different hypersurfaces @xmath95 for @xmath98 are disjoint and sweep out a neighborhood that can be identified in the obvious way with @xmath99 .",
    "also , the liouville condition @xmath76 implies that the above diffeomorphism @xmath96 respects the characteristic foliations .",
    "thus @xmath95 has a closed characteristic for either all @xmath49 or none . on the other hand we can choose a proper hamiltonian @xmath44 such that @xmath100 on @xmath95 and @xmath101 outside of our neighborhood @xmath99 .",
    "then theorem  [ thm : aee ] implies that @xmath95 has a closed characteristic for almost every @xmath49 .",
    "hence there is a closed characteristic for every @xmath49 , and in particular for @xmath102 .",
    "another important example of a manifold with a contact form is the unit cotangent bundle of a riemannian manifold .    to start , let @xmath103 be a smooth manifold .",
    "there is a canonical @xmath61-form @xmath65 on the cotangent bundle @xmath104 , defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath105 denote the projection .",
    "if @xmath106 , and if @xmath107 , then @xmath108 is the composition @xmath109 more explicitly , if @xmath110 are local coordinates on a coordinate patch @xmath111 , then one can write any cotangent vector at a point in @xmath24 as @xmath112 , and this gives local coordinates @xmath113 on @xmath114 . in these",
    "coordinates @xmath115 it follows from this last equation that @xmath116 defines a symplectic form on @xmath104 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath103 has a riemannian metric .",
    "this induces a metric on @xmath104 , and we consider the unit cotangent bundle @xmath117 the restriction of @xmath65 to @xmath118 is a contact form .",
    "indeed @xmath118 is a hypersurface of contact type in the symplectic manifold @xmath119 , with transverse liouville vector field @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "it turns out that the associated reeb vector field agrees with the geodesic flow , under the identification @xmath122 given by the metric .",
    "thus reeb orbits in @xmath118 are equivalent to closed geodesics in @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath103 is compact , then so is @xmath118 , so the weinstein conjecture is applicable in this case , where it is equivalent to the classical lyusternik - fet theorem asserting that every compact riemannian manifold has at least one closed geodesic .",
    "more generally , the above liouville vector field @xmath73 shows that a hypersurface @xmath123 which intersects each fiber transversely in a star - shaped subset of the fiber is of contact type .",
    "rabinowitz proved the existence of closed characteristics for a related class of hypersurfaces in @xmath19 .",
    "alan weinstein points out to me that this example and the unit cotangent bundle example were important motivation for his conjecture .",
    "another general example of manifolds with contact forms is given by circle bundles , or `` prequantization spaces '' .",
    "let @xmath124 be a symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath125 , and suppose that the cohomology class @xmath126/2\\pi\\in h^2(\\sigma;{{\\mathbb r}})$ ] is the image of an integral class @xmath127 .",
    "let @xmath128 be the principal @xmath129-bundle with first chern class @xmath130 .",
    "this means that there is a free @xmath129 action on @xmath1 whose quotient is @xmath131 , and @xmath127 is the primary obstruction to finding a section @xmath132 . let @xmath80 denote the derivative of the @xmath129 action ; this is a vector field on @xmath1 which is tangent to the fibers . since @xmath13 is a closed form in the cohomology class @xmath133 , one can find a ( real - valued ) connection @xmath61-form @xmath65 on @xmath1 whose curvature equals @xmath13 .",
    "these conditions mean that @xmath65 is invariant under the @xmath129 action , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "it follows that @xmath65 is a contact form on @xmath1 whose reeb vector field is @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , the reeb orbits are the fibers ( which all have period @xmath136 ) and their iterates .",
    "the fact that reeb orbits appear here in @xmath137-dimensional smooth families is a special feature arising from the symmetry of the picture . for a `` generic '' contact form on a manifold @xmath0",
    "the reeb orbits are isolated , in the sense that if @xmath92 is a reeb orbit of length @xmath138 which goes through a point @xmath139 , then there is no other reeb orbit through a point close to @xmath25 with length close to @xmath138 .",
    "for example , on a circle bundle as above , one can get rid of most of the reeb orbits by perturbing the contact form @xmath65 to @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a smooth function .",
    "this is still a contact form as long as @xmath142 .",
    "the new reeb vector field is given by @xmath143 where @xmath31 is the hamiltonian vector field on @xmath131 determined by @xmath39 , and @xmath144 denotes its horizontal lift , ie the unique vector field on @xmath1 with @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "consequently , for this new contact form , the only fibers that are reeb orbits are the fibers over the critical points of @xmath39 . on the other hand",
    "there may be additional reeb orbits that cover closed orbits of @xmath31 .",
    "however it follows from that if @xmath39 and @xmath147 are small , then these reeb orbits all have period much greater than @xmath136 . in any case",
    ", the weinstein conjecture here asserts that there is no way to eliminate all of the remaining reeb orbits without introducing new ones .",
    "the weinstein conjecture in this case can be proved using cylindrical contact homology @xcite , about which we will have more to say in  [ sec : cch ] .",
    "we now restrict attention to the three - dimensional case .",
    "much more is known about contact geometry in three dimensions than in higher dimensions , and to gain an appreciation for taubes s result and its proof it will help to review some of the basics of this . for much more about this subject",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recall that a contact form on a closed oriented three - manifold @xmath0 is a @xmath61-form @xmath65 such that @xmath148 everywhere .",
    "the associated _ contact structure _ is the @xmath14-plane field @xmath149 .",
    "this has an orientation induced from the orientation of @xmath0 and the direction of the reeb vector field .",
    "in general one defines a contact structure is not assumed to be oriented and is only required to be locally the kernel of a contact form . ] to be an oriented @xmath14-plane field which is the kernel of some contact form as above .",
    "a contact structure is a `` totally nonintegrable '' @xmath14-plane field , which means that in a sense it as far as possible from being a foliation : the kernel of @xmath65 is a foliation if and only if @xmath150 .",
    "different contact forms can give rise to the same contact structure . to be precise ,",
    "if @xmath65 is a contact form , then @xmath151 is another contact form giving rise to the same contact structure if and only if @xmath152 where @xmath58 is a positive smooth function .",
    "for a given contact structure , the reeb vector field depends on the choice of contact form , but it is always transverse to the contact structure .",
    "a ( three - dimensional closed ) _ contact manifold _ is a pair @xmath153 where @xmath0 is a closed oriented three - manifold and @xmath154 is a contact structure on @xmath0 .",

    "the contact structure defined by is invariant under translation in the @xmath164 direction .",
    "the contact planes are horizontal along the @xmath25 axis , but rotate as one moves in the @xmath165 direction ; the total rotation angle as @xmath165 goes from @xmath166 to @xmath167 is @xmath168 .",
    "the reeb vector field associated to @xmath65 is simply @xmath169 in particular there are no reeb orbits . of course",
    "this does not contradict the weinstein conjecture since @xmath162 is not compact , but it does indicate that any proof of the weinstein conjecture will need to use global considerations .      define an _ overtwisted disk _ in a contact 3-manifold @xmath153 to be a smoothly embedded closed disk @xmath170 such that for each @xmath171 we have @xmath172 .",

    "a theorem of eliashberg asserts that all tight contact structures on @xmath8 are isotopic to this one .",
    "if @xmath0 is the unit sphere in @xmath53 , then the reeb vector field is tangent to the fibers of the hopf fibration @xmath182 . in particular",

    "then there exists @xmath739 such that the following holds",
    ". suppose @xmath922 .",
    "let @xmath610 be a solution to the perturbed seiberg - witten equations with @xmath923 and @xmath924 .",
    "then there exists @xmath925 and a finite collection of arcs @xmath229 in @xmath0 indexed by @xmath926 such that :    * each @xmath473 is tangent to the reeb vector field . *",
    "the length of each arc @xmath473 is at most @xmath776 .",
    "also the sum of the lengths of the arcs is at least @xmath927 . *",
    "the distance between the endpoint of @xmath473 and the starting point of @xmath928 is at most @xmath929 .",
    "it follows from the claim that given a sequence @xmath930 of solutions to the perturbed seiberg - witten equations satisfying conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in theorem  [ thm : convergence ] , one can pass to a subsequence such that the corresponding chains of arcs @xmath473 converge to a reeb orbit .",
    "to prove the claim , let @xmath610 be a solution to the perturbed seiberg - witten equations with @xmath923 and @xmath924 .",
    "write @xmath856 as usual .",
    "it follows from the dirac equation and the a priori estimates , , and that @xmath931 where @xmath868 is an @xmath174-independent constant .",
    "it also follows from and that if @xmath174 is sufficiently large , then there exist points where @xmath932 .",
    "assume that it is and choose such a point @xmath241 .",
    "also fix @xmath174-independent constants @xmath933 ( to be specified more later ) .",
    "we can now choose an embedding of the disc @xmath377 of radius @xmath934 into @xmath0 mapping the center of the disc to @xmath241 , such that the disc is orthogonal to the reeb vector field at @xmath241 , and the induced metric on the disc is euclidean to first order at the origin .",
    "denote the coordinates on the disc by @xmath935 .",
    "we can uniquely extend the embedding of the disc @xmath377 to a map from the cylinder @xmath936 $ ] to @xmath0 such that the derivative of the interval coordinate @xmath384 maps to the reeb vector field .",
    "we can assume that the map of the cylinder is an embedding ( for @xmath937 ) , otherwise we already know that the claim is true .",
    "we then take the arc @xmath470 to be the image of @xmath938 $ ] under this embedding .",
    "now let @xmath939\\to{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] be a cutoff function which is @xmath61 on @xmath940 $ ] , monotone decreasing , and @xmath247 on @xmath941 $ ] . for @xmath942 $ ]",
    "define @xmath943 in view of and , this is the contribution to the energy @xmath944 from the disc @xmath945 ( weighted by the cutoff function ) , up to an error of order @xmath946 .",
    "now it follows from that @xmath947 on a disc of radius order @xmath946 in @xmath948 , so @xmath949 for some @xmath174-independent constant @xmath950 .",
    "also , differentiating with respect to @xmath384 and using the a priori estimates and shows that @xmath951 for some @xmath174-independent constant @xmath820 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath952 is chosen sufficiently small , then @xmath953 , and the contribution to the energy @xmath944 from the cylinder is bounded from below by an @xmath174-independent constant .    to complete the proof of the claim , it is enough to show that the disk @xmath954 contains a point where @xmath932 .",
    "we can then repeat the above argument to construct a sequence of cylinders in @xmath0 , and define the arcs @xmath473 to be the core intervals of these cylinders .",
    "there is an upper bound to the number of cylinders one can construct before a new cylinder overlaps an old cylinder , because each cylinder contributes at least @xmath820 to the energy , while the total energy is bounded from above by @xmath494 .",
    "when a new cylinder overlaps an old one , we then obtain the desired chain of arcs .",
    "in fact , if the constant @xmath955 is sufficiently large , then @xmath518 must have a zero on @xmath954 . to see why , rescale @xmath954 by the map @xmath956 , so as to identify @xmath954 with the disc of radius @xmath955 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath831 to the latter now satisfies @xmath957 as a result of , , and .",
    "that is , @xmath831 satisfies the vortex equations on the disk , up to an error of order @xmath946 . moreover , if @xmath955 is sufficiently large , then there must exist a large @xmath958 such that @xmath959 on the circle of radius @xmath960 ; otherwise the arguments giving and would imply that the energy @xmath961 .",
    "a compactness argument then shows that if @xmath174 is sufficiently large , then @xmath831 not only approximately solves the vortex equations , but is @xmath962-approximated by an actual solution @xmath963 to the vortex equations on @xmath621 with finite energy , where @xmath964 is close to @xmath61 outside of the disc of radius @xmath768 .",
    "it now follows from lemma  [ lem : vortex ] that @xmath518 must have a zero in the disc of radius @xmath960 .",
    "this completes the sketch of the proof of the claim , and hence the existence of a reeb orbit .",
    "a more careful version of this argument keeping track of all of the zero set of @xmath518 , see @xcite , shows that in fact there exists a nonempty orbit set poincar dual to @xmath685 .",
    "with the three - dimensional weinstein conjecture now proved , there are various directions in which one might try to generalize .        as we saw in ",
    "[ sec : se ] , the standard contact form on an irrational ellipsoid has exactly two embedded reeb orbits . also one can take the quotient of the ellipsoid by a @xmath965 action on @xmath966 that rotates each @xmath621 factor , to obtain a contact form on a lens space with exactly two embedded reeb orbits . perhaps surprisingly ,",
    "these are the only examples known to us of contact forms on closed ( connected ) 3-manifolds with only finitely many embedded reeb orbits .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for a large class of contact forms on @xmath8 there are either two or infinitely many embedded reeb orbits . for other 3-manifolds one can ask :      as mentioned in  [ sec : previous ] , colin - honda @xcite used linearized contact homology to prove the existence of infinitely many embedded reeb orbits for many cases of contact structures supported by open books with pseudo - anosov monodromy . also it is proved in @xcite , using the isomorphism between seiberg - witten floer homology and embedded contact homology ( see  [ sec : ech ] ) , that if @xmath0 is a closed oriented 3-manifold other than a lens space , then any contact form on @xmath0 with all reeb orbits nondegenerate ( see  [ sec : nro ] ) has at least three embedded reeb orbits .",
    "nonetheless there remains a substantial gap between what we can prove and what seems to be true .",
    "next one might try to prove the existence of closed orbits for somewhat more general vector fields than reeb vector fields .",
    "for example , inspection of the proof of the weinstein conjecture for a compact hypersurface @xmath0 in @xmath19 of contact type , see  [ sec : hct ] , shows that the contact type hypothesis can be replaced by the weaker assumption that the hypersurface is `` stable '' .",
    "a hypersurface @xmath0 in a symplectic manifold @xmath55 is called _ stable _ if it has a neighborhood @xmath967 with an identification @xmath968 sending @xmath0 to @xmath87 , such that the characteristic foliations on @xmath969 are conjugate for all @xmath970 .",
    "it turns out ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.3 ) ) that a compact hypersurface @xmath0 is stable if and only if @xmath971 is part of a `` stable hamiltonian structure '' on @xmath0 .",
    "a _ stable hamiltonian structure _ on a @xmath78 dimensional oriented manifold @xmath0 is a pair @xmath972 where @xmath65 is a @xmath61-form on @xmath0 and @xmath13 is a closed @xmath14-form on @xmath0 , such that @xmath973 and @xmath974 .",
    "a stable hamiltonian structure determines a `` reeb vector field '' @xmath80 characterized by @xmath975 and @xmath134 .",
    "a contact form is a special case of this in which @xmath976 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , again using the isomorphism between seiberg - witten floer homology and embedded contact homology , that for any closed oriented connected 3-manifold @xmath0 that is not a @xmath199-bundle over @xmath129 , for any stable hamiltonian structure on @xmath0 , the associated reeb vector field has a closed orbit .",
    "the same conclusion is proved without using seiberg - witten theory , but under some additional hypotheses , by rechtman @xcite . in general , however , it remains unclear what exactly one needs to assume about a vector field in order to guarantee the existence of a closed orbit .      for even more general vector fields",
    ", one can try to prove weaker statements than the existence of a closed orbit . for example",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed oriented 3-manifold with a volume form @xmath977 , and let @xmath1 be a smooth vector field on @xmath0 .",
    "the vector field @xmath1 generates a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms @xmath978 .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is divergence free , meaning that each @xmath979 preserves the volume form , or equivalently @xmath980 .",
    "a measure @xmath751 on @xmath0 is said to be `` @xmath1-invariant '' if @xmath981 for each @xmath982 .",
    "the vector field @xmath1 is called _ uniquely ergodic _ if the only @xmath1-invariant measures on @xmath0 are real multiples of the volume form .",
    "note that if @xmath1 has a closed orbit then it is not uniquely ergodic .",
    "more generally , one could look for conditions on @xmath1 that guarantee that it is not uniquely ergodic .",
    "taubes @xcite establishes such a condition as follows .",
    "call @xmath1 `` exact '' if @xmath983 for some @xmath61-form @xmath65 . in this case",
    "define the `` self - linking '' of @xmath1 , cf @xcite , to be @xmath984 by stokes theorem , this does not depend on the choice of @xmath65 .",
    "for example , if @xmath985 everywhere , then the integrand in is positive , so @xmath986 . in this case",
    "@xmath65 is a contact form and @xmath1 is a positive multiple of its reeb vector field .",
    "more generally one has :      taubes proves this similarly to the weinstein conjecture .",
    "one considers the perturbed seiberg - witten equations with @xmath65 replaced by @xmath988 , and proves a modification of theorem  [ thm : convergence ] in which hypothesis ( 2 ) in that theorem is dropped .",
    "a nontrivial @xmath1-invariant measure is obtained as a limit of a subsequence of the sequence of measures @xmath989 for an appropriately chosen sequence @xmath930 .",
    "there is also the following `` relative '' version of the weinstein conjecture .",
    "let @xmath153 be a contact 3-manifold .",
    "legendrian knot _ is a knot @xmath990 such that @xmath991 for every @xmath992 . now choose a contact form @xmath65 with @xmath993 .",
    "a _ reeb chord _ of @xmath994 is a path @xmath995\\to y$ ] for some @xmath3 such that @xmath996 and @xmath92 is a flow line of the reeb vector field , ie @xmath997 . for example , any legendrian knot @xmath994 in @xmath162 with the standard contact form must have a reeb chord , because the projection of @xmath994 to the @xmath200 plane must have area zero , so it must have a crossing .",
    "a version of the arnold chord conjecture asserts that for any legendrian knot in a closed 3-manifold with a contact form , there exists a reeb chord .",
    "this has been proved for the standard contact structure on @xmath8 @xcite , and for legendrian unknots in tight contact 3-manifolds satisfying certain assumptions @xcite , but it seems that not too much is known about the general case .      in higher dimensions , although the weinstein conjecture is known for compact hypersurfaces of contact type in @xmath19 and for some other cases , in general it is wide open .",
    "the techniques used in taubes s proof are special to three dimensions .",
    "in particular no good analogue of the seiberg - witten invariants is currently known in dimensions greater than four . in addition there is no obvious higher - dimensional analogue of embedded contact homology .",
    "( in higher dimensions one expects that generically all non - multiply - covered holomorphic curves of the relevant index are embedded , compare @xcite . )",
    "one can still use holomorphic curves in higher dimensions to define linearized contact homology and related invariants from symplectic field theory @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if these invariants are sufficient to prove the weinstein conjecture in all cases .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the weinstein conjecture holds for `` ps - overtwisted '' contact structures , which are a certain higher dimensional analogue of overtwisted contact structures , cf  [ sec : overtwisted ] .",
