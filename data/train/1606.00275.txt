    "it has been seen , in several nearby disk galaxies , that sf can occur at least as far as 4 or 5 times their optical radius d25 , where average gas densities are very low .",
    "this means that there are locally dense regions of gas in the outskirts capable of collapsing into stars , but the mechanism that triggers such collapse is yet to be known .",
    "one possibility would be the infall of gas from an external reservoir of gas surrounding galaxies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* snchez almeida et al . 2014 ) ) .",
    "evidence of the existence of such reservoir can be seen in the hi gas distribution around galaxies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "* bouquin et al . ( 2015 ) ) , the ( fuv - nuv ) vs ( nuv-[3.6 ] ) color - color diagram , constructed from asymptotic magnitudes , revealed the clearly bimodal distribution of nearby galaxies , with a narrow blue sequence ( the galex blue sequence or gbs ) populated by late - type star forming galaxies ( sfg ) , and a less narrow red sequence ( the galex red sequence or grs ) populated by quiescent early - type galaxies distributed along , while some intermediary type galaxies are distributed between the gbs and the grs ( the galex green valley or ggv ) , which are seemingly leaving the gbs and going toward the grs ( although the possibility for a galaxy to go from the grs to the gbs is not ruled out ) .",
    "while the gbs extends and intersects the grs , galaxies in the ggv seems to be drifting away from the gbs , effectively becoming redder .",
    "so what sets these ggv galaxies apart from other gbs or grs galaxies ?",
    "it is clearly not driven by mass since more massive gbs are found . in order to evaluate the reddening / blueing of the outer disk quantitatively , we first identified the disk region in our galaxies using an homogeneous set of criteria .",
    "from the 3.6 @xmath0 m surface brightness ( sb ) versus kiloparsec profiles , we fit an error - weighted line to the disk part once the region dominated by the disk light is delimitated .",
    "we used the galactocentric distance r80 that corresponds to the distance where 80% of the ir light is enclosed , and varied our disk cutoff by factors of r80 to exclude inner data points to decide where the best linear fit occurs .",
    "we also imposed a sb magnitude cutoff to select only the fainter parts of the disk .",
    "we find that the best fit , with a close - to - unity average reduced @xmath10 , occurs when r / r80=0.25 to 0.50 and @xmath3}$ ] = 22.5 to 23 mag / arcsec@xmath11 .",

    "these color profiles show that the ( @xmath12 ) color is most sensitive to variations in the recent sf history : while most galaxies have bluer outer disks , a significant fraction ( @xmath650% ) of ggv galaxies have a more positive gradient ( i.e. reddening ) .",
    "this is also seen in these other colors .",

    "these reddening disks always have a redder outskirts than their inner part , with a bluer bulge and red disk , and appear to be reddening _ outside - in_. this indicates that whatever mechanism(s ) is / are quenching sf activities starts affecting the outskirts of disks first and eating its way to the inner parts .",
