    "it should be remarked that the matrix inversion in @xmath119 can pre - computed and stored at the receiver for systems with repetitive spreading codes . in order to develop a recursive algorithm for estimating the channel",

    "this procedure for channel estimation also works well and can accurately determine the coefficients of the channels across the links comprising the base station , the relays and the destination terminal .",
    "the complexity of the proposed rls channel estimation algorithm is @xmath112 .",
    "we evaluate the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of the proposed joint power allocation and interference suppression ( jpais ) algorithms and compare them with interference suppression schemes without cooperation ( ncis ) @xcite and with cooperation ( cis ) using an equal power allocation across the relays @xcite .",
    "we consider a stationary ds - cdma network with randomly generated spreading codes with a processing gain @xmath125 .",
    "the block fading channels are generated considering a random power delay profile with gains taken from a complex gaussian variable with unit variance and mean zero , @xmath126 paths , and are normalized so that over the packets we have @xmath127{\\boldsymbol { \\mathcal h}}[i]]=1 $ ] .",
    "we adopt the af cooperative strategy with repetitions and all the relays and the destination terminal are equipped with linear mmse receivers.it should be remarked that the noise amplification of the af protocol is considered @xcite .",

    "the aim of this experiment is to compare the proposed sg algorithms that utilize the solutions for the lagrange multipliers in the recursions ( [ sgrew ] [ sgreca ] ) with the simpler method that introduces a normalization of the power allocation vector ( [ sgrew ] , [ sgreca2 ] and [ sgreca2x ] ) .",
    "the techniques compared employ sg algorithms for estimation of the coefficients of the channel . from the results we notice that the sg recursions that obtain the values of the lagrange multipliers via the solution of the quadratic equation have a slightly better performance than the normalization - based approach .",
    "this is basically due to a greater precision in the computation of the power allocation coefficients .",

    "a joint constrained optimization framework that considers the allocation of power levels across the relays subject to an individual power constraint and the design of linear receivers for interference suppression was presented .",
