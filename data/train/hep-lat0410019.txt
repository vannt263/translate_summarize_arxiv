    "in ref .  @xcite it is argued that a _ heating _ quench of qcd from its confined phase of disordered polyakov loops into its deconfined phase of ordered polyakov loops leads to vacuum domains of distinct @xmath1 triality , and one ought to be concerned about non - equilibrium effects due to heating of the system .",
    "this comes because the heating is a rapid quench and the qcd high temperature vacuum carries structures which are similar to the low temperature phase of analogue spin models .    here",
    "we report a similar investigation for su(3 ) lattice gauge theory and preliminary results about the influence of such domains on the gluonic energy density and pressure of pure su(3 ) lattice gauge theory .",

    "@xcite is used ( no over - relaxation , to stay in the universality class of glauber dynamics ) .",
    "although this is certainly not the physical dynamics of qcd , in the present state of affairs it appears important to collect qualitative ideas about eventual dynamical effects . for this purpose",
    "the investigation of any dynamics , which actually allows for its study ought to be useful .",
    "we report numerical results for the structure factors ( or functions ) defined by @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the relevant fluctuation about some average . for gauge systems we deal with fluctuations of the polyakov loop ( for analogue spin systems with fluctuations of the magnetization ) .",
    "the time @xmath4 corresponds to the dynamical process , i.e. , in our case the markov chain mc time . within the linear theory the differential equation @xmath5",
    "can be derived , where @xmath6 is the response coefficient and @xmath7 the derivative of the coarse - grained free energy density with respect to the fluctuation variable .",

    "( [ omega_k ] ) implies that the amplitude of any fluctuation approaches a constant exponentially fast with time .",

    "while the the system grows competing fk clusters of each magnetization before one becomes dominant , geometrical clusters do not compete .",
    "this picture is unfavorable for the use of geometrical clusters of polyakov loops in gauge theories , for which the fk definition does not exist .",
    "the process of competitions between the largest fk clusters of different magnetization leads for the proper transition ( @xmath87 ) to a divergence of the equilibration time in the limit of infinite systems , an effect known in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "potts studies @xcite with an external magnetic field show that a major slowing down effect survives for @xmath88 . as the influence of an external magnetic field on the potts model is similar to that of quarks on su(3 )",
    "gauge theory this indicates that the effect may be of relevance for qcd studies of the crossover region .    for gauge theories a satisfactory cluster definition is presently not available .",
