    "<S> after normalization , the second - order autocorrelation is @xmath20 ( we use the notation @xmath47 to indicate we have both time - binned and normalized the raw coincidence counts , so this represents our experimental measurement of the theoretical value @xmath48 .    in a process analogous to obtaining the second - order autocorrelation function , </S>",
    "<S> we now extract the third - order temporal auto - correlation function @xmath49 via the three - photon coincidence counts @xmath21 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sc - g3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed correlations in this plot are in agreement with the previously reported measurements of @xmath39 in the photon tunneling regime of a strongly coupled qd  cavity system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the noticeable lines of enhanced peaks correspond to the number of three photon events in which ( i ) the first and second photon arrive simultaneously ( the vertical line , @xmath50 ) , ( ii ) the second and third photon arrive simultaneously ( the horizontal line , @xmath25 , shown in more detail in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sc - g3](e ) ) , and ( iii ) the first and third photon arrive simultaneously ( the diagonal line with @xmath51 ) . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the highest peak at @xmath52 corresponds to third - order temporal bunching in transmitted photons with @xmath53 , which is noticeably more than the value obtained for @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the range of variation in this value has contributions both from the standard deviation of the number of detection events for a given pulse ( as determined by a poissionian distribution ) and from the uncertainty in the normalization constant  this is discussed in more detail in appendix a.    in contrast , the same @xmath4 and @xmath55 measurements for the photoluminescence from a qd weakly coupled to a photonic - crystal nanocavity show a very different signature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in such a system we discover that @xmath56 , i.e. , there are significantly fewer events in which three photons arrive simultaneously than events in which two photons arrive simultaneously , as expected for an imperfect single photon source ( see appendix b ) .        </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the autocorrelation measurements for a set of probe laser frequencies to map the spectral dependence of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> because the cavity had slightly shifted in frequency , the measurement was now performed with the sample kept at a higher temperature ( @xmath57 k instead of @xmath58 k ) , which negatively affected the amount of detectable photon bunching . </S>",
    "<S> the qd is also slightly red - detuned from the cavity resonance . nevertheless , the frequency scan in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan](a ) shows that as the probe is tuned , the third - order autocorrelation @xmath59 of the transmitted photons exhibits either antibunched or bunched behavior as the system transitions from the photon blockade to the photon - induced tunneling regime ( for a probe red - detuned from the cavity resonance ) . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan](a ) also shows the values of @xmath54 obtained for the same frequency scan . in the tunneling regime @xmath60 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e.  the simultaneous arrival of three photons is enhanced compared to simultaneous two - photon arrivals , which is in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations ( shown in appendix a ) . during the experiment , we kept the probe power constant at @xmath61 nw ( corresponding to an approximate intra - cavity photon number of 0.17 ) and the coupling of the probe into the cavity was re - optimized for every data point . </S>",
    "<S> the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan ] show a good agreement with numerical simulations of the values of @xmath62 and @xmath2 as a function of probe detuning , given the system parameters measured earlier ( @xmath63 ghz , @xmath64 ghz , and @xmath26 ghz ) , a probe driving strength of @xmath65 ghz , a qd  cavity detuning of @xmath66 ghz , and the fraction of qd `` dark state '' time @xmath67 ( note that this is significantly higher than our earlier estimate based on the reflectivity spectrum of the qd - cavity system , probably due to the higher temperature needed to bring the dot into resonance with the cavity during this measurement ) . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the experimental data and numerical simulations show that the bunching in @xmath62 and @xmath2 when the probe is on resonance with the qd and the cavity drops off as a function of probe power ( the inset of fig .  [ fig_freq - scan](a ) ) , leveling out when the intra - cavity photon number nears 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this power dependence indicates that the bunching we observe is indeed due to photon - induced tunneling and not classical bunching due to blinking ; at higher powers , the qd saturates @xcite , which in turn diminishes the polariton dip @xcite and reduces the amount of bunching observed in the light transmitted through the system , an effect which is well reproduced by our numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we would like to point out that there are several factors that account for the difference between the theoretically predicted values of the second- and third - order autocorrelations @xmath68 and @xmath49 and our experimentally observed values : background light due to imperfect extinction of the uncoupled probe in the cross - polarization setup , quantum dot blinking and spectral diffusion , temperature - dependence of the quantum dot dephasing rate , and non - negligible bandwidth of the probe pulses . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the quantum dot blinking and background light cause the observed signal to have a large coherent - state component .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the theoretically predicted values of @xmath2 , the third - order photon correlations in a laser beam transmitted through a strongly - coupled qd  cavity system , differ more significantly than the values of @xmath3 from the unity expected from coherent ( laser ) light . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that @xmath69 is a more sensitive diagnostic tool for observing non - classicality in the measured photon statistics , as it can more clearly be distinguished from the signature of coherent light . </S>",
    "<S> this approach  increasing the order of the correlations in order to get a more clear signature of non - coherent light  </S>",
    "<S> is further illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan](b - d ) showing the preliminary results of our measurements of the fourth - order autocorrelation function    @xmath70    the four - photon correlations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan](b ) ) were obtained by adding another photon counter to the generalized hbt setup ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan](c ) ) , and then binning and normalizing the four - photon coincidences in the transmitted light through this qd - cavity system probed with resonant ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sc - g3](a ) ) laser pulses , a process equivalent to that described above for @xmath39 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_freq - scan](d ) then shows how value of the autocorrelation - function at zero time keeps increasing with the order of the auto - correlation function for light transmitted by the cavity - qd in photon - induced tunneling regime . </S>",
    "<S> a down - side of this approach is the increasing measurement time required to collect enough events for a meaningful statistical analysis , which might not be possible in some experimental systems ( see appendix a for a discussion of the count rate in our setup ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , to achieve efficient generation of photon pairs and other higher - order fock states in this way , a system with a better dot  cavity coupling strength @xmath71 and higher cavity quality factor would be needed ( as indicated by the numerical simulations presented in appendix a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , optimizing the dot  cavity detuning of the system with current parameters could possibly also be employed to improve photon blockade and as an alternative scheme for generating higher - order fock states , as recently proposed by snchez - muoz _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a source of such higher - order photon states could then be used for efficient generation of the highly - entangled noon - states , which are particularly interesting for quantum metrology and high resolution quantum lithography and sensing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , these higher - order autocorrelations have the potential to be used for monitoring phase transitions in condensed matter simulations based on photon gases @xcite .    </S>",
