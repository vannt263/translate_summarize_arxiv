    "<S> we propose , theoretically , a new type of quantum field effect transistor that operates purely on the flow of spin current in the absence of charge current . </S>",
    "<S> this spin field effect transistor ( sfet ) is constructed without _ any _ magnetic material , but with the help of spin flip mechanism provided by a rotating external magnetic field of uniform strength . </S>",
    "<S> the sfet generates a _ constant _ instantaneous spin current that is sensitively controllable by a gate voltage as well as by the frequency and strength of the rotating field . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of a carbon nanotube based sfet is provided as an example .    </S>",
    "<S> si - based field effect transistors ( fet ) have played a pivotal role in the the technology that drives the microelectronics revolution . it has however been projected that si technology is rapidly approaching its limit of miniaturation@xcite , and various new and exciting ideas of nano - electronics have been proposed and pursued . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important possibilities of nano - electronics is the hope of using spin  </S>",
    "<S> in addition to charge , for nonlinear electronic device applications@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , progress has been achieved in certain areas of spintronics such as device applications based on the giant magnetoresistive effect@xcite , the understanding of material properties of magnetic semiconductors@xcite , the improvements of spin injection across a magnetic  </S>",
    "<S> nonmagnetic interface@xcite , and optical manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in nanostructures@xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that it is already more than ten years since the proposal@xcite of fet operation on spin - polarized charge current , the spin - fet ( sfet ) has been an elusive system up to now . </S>",
    "<S> the overwhelming majority of actual spintronics devices and proposals up to now are hybrid systems which involve both magnetic and non - magnetic materials@xcite . due to differences in chemical bonding and structural property of them , </S>",
    "<S> these hybrid materials have proven to be rather challenging to use . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with several other physical factors related to spin transport , has limited the rapid development of practical nonlinear spintronic devices such as the sfet .    in this paper , we take a different direction by theoretically examining the possibility of sfet operation _ without _ involving magnetic materials and we exploit such a novel sfet which operates purely on _ spin current_. this sfet turns out to be realizable  as we predict , in coherent nanostructures ( such as a quantum dot , a quantum well , or a carbon nanotube ) , in the presence of a rotating external magnetic field of uniform strength . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the rotating field induces a _ time - independent _ ( _ i.e. _ a dc ) spin current , and at the same time it generates no charge current ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the spin current is critically tunable by a gate voltage which shifts the electronic levels of the non - magnetic nanostructure so that sfet operation is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the physical principle of our sfet is due to spin flip mechanism provided by the field , but is ultimately connected to the quantum physics of berry s phase@xcite . because no magnetic material is involved in our sfet , any problem that relates to spin injection across a magnetic - nonmagnetic interface is bypassed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , because there is no charge current involved , our sfet will be less affected by problems of heat dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> since many non - magnetic nanostructures , such as a carbon nanotube , have long spin coherent lengths@xcite , our proposed quantum sfet should be experimentally realizable . to provide a concrete numerical example </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the transport characteristics of an all - nanotube based sfet .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a three - probe non - magnetic device shown in the inset of fig.1 which consists of a scattering region ohmic - contacted by two probes while the third probe is a metallic gate capacitively coupled to the scattering region . </S>",

    "<S> , the first term stands for the hamiltonian of noninteracting electrons in the leads with @xmath5 the creation operators in lead @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have set the same chemical potential for both leads because , as we will see below , a rotating magnetic field will `` pump '' out a dc spin current without needing a bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> quantum parametric pumping of _ charge current _ has been well analyzed before@xcite , and here we demonstrate that puming of a spin current will lead to sfet operation . the second term and @xmath2 correspond to the hamiltonian of the scattering region which is subjected to a time - dependent ( rotating ) magnetic field with uniform strength , @xmath7 $ ] where @xmath8 is the constant field strength . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering region is characterized by an energy level @xmath9 which can be controlled by the gate voltage @xmath10 ( see inset of fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have only included the coupling between magnetic field and the spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is however not difficult to confirm that the orbital degrees of freedom do not contribute to the current in the presence of time varying magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in the presence of magnetic field , the hopping matrix element between sites i and j , @xmath11 , in the tight binding description , will be modified by a phase factor @xmath12 $ ] with @xmath13 . but </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 due to our rotating magnetic field in the @xmath15 plane is simply zero , therefore the orbital parameter @xmath11 is not affected by the rotating field . the third term in eq.([eq1 ] ) denotes coupling between the scattering region and lead @xmath6 with coupling matrix elements @xmath16 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we solve the transport properties ( charge and spin currents ) of the model in both adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes using the standard keldysh nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) technique@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> in the adiabatic limit , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the linewidth function . </S>",
    "<S> we will apply the wideband limit so that @xmath27 is independent of energy . in eq.([charge ] ) , quantity @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 matrix in spin space given by eq.([hp ] ) , @xmath31    using eqs.([charge],[hp1],[gr ] ) , the instantaneous electric current is found to be ( fermi energy and temperature are set to zero ) : @xmath32 several observations are in order for this result . </S>",
    "<S> first , spin flip mechanism ( due to eq.([hp1 ] ) ) in the scattering region is provided by the rotating magnetic field with processes in which photons are absorbed and re - emitted . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the _ instantaneous _ current is actually time - independent as eq.([dqdt1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the total instantaneous charge current @xmath33 identically , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ a rotating magnetic field does not pump a charge current . </S>",
    "<S> third , there is a nonzero spin current @xmath34 . from eq.([dqdt1 ] ) , the spin current depends on field strength @xmath8 , frequency @xmath35 of the rotating field , and more importantly on the energy level positions @xmath36 which is modulated by the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> it is this modulation which provides the operation principle of our sfet . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum spin current in the adiabatic regime is obtained by setting @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 this lineshape  involving fourth power of the relevant quantities , is ideal for sfet operation : @xmath40 is very sensitive to the energy level position which is controlled by the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at resonance @xmath41 the spin current reaches its maximum value @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath43 is varied by @xmath10 to @xmath44 , the spin current is reduced by a factor of @xmath45 . since @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the period of rotating magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that at resonance , our device pumps out exactly one spin through the left or the right lead in one rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this quantization of pumped spin is substantially easier to realize than that of charge@xcite in a charge pump . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that for a multi - probe system such as ours , the total spin pumped out of the device is two spin quanta . </S>",
    "<S> but if there is only one lead connected to the scattering region , the spin current is given by eq.([spin ] ) multiplied by a factor of two : in this case our device can be viewed as a nonmagnetic version of spin battery@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> why our device can pump out a dc spin current without a bias ? as pointed out by avron et al@xcite , in a quantum parametric _ </S>",
    "<S> charge _ </S>",
    "<S> pump , the pumped charge per cycle is related to the berry s phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this physical picture can be easily generalized to the case of spin current discussed in this work . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , using the spinor @xmath48 with @xmath49 the scattering matrix , the pumped charge can be obtained@xcite from the definition of berry s phase @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 label the slowly varying system parameters , and @xmath53 is the period of variation . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the case of charge pumping , @xmath54 corresponds to the instantaneous pumped charge . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath55 in eq.([eq1 ] ) , it is easy to verify@xcite that @xmath54 ( instantaneous phase ) is independent of time .    * non - adiabatic regime . </S>",
    "<S> * the electric and spin current beyond the adiabatic approximation can be calculated exactly using negf . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define the particle current operator in spin space , @xmath56}{dt } \\label{j1 } \\\\ & = & -i\\sum_{k}[t_{k\\alpha } c_{k\\alpha \\sigma } ^{+}d_{\\sigma ^{\\prime } } -t_{k\\alpha } ^{\\ast } d_{\\sigma } ^{+}c_{k\\alpha \\sigma ^{\\prime } } ]   \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the electric current operator is @xmath57 and the spin current operator is @xmath58 where @xmath59 . from ( [ j1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we compute particle current @xmath60   \\label{particle_cur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the negfs are defined as @xmath61 , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> they are calculated by the keldysh equation @xmath63 in standard fashion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the transport problem is reduced to the calculation of the retarded green s function @xmath64 .    in general , a perturbation theory is needed to solve a time - dependent problem . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , for the time - dependent hamiltonian considered here , @xmath65 can be solved _ </S>",
    "<S> exactly _ as follows . </S>",
    "<S> it is simple to obtain the retarded green s function for the diagonal part ( in spin space ) of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath66 the full green s function of hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) is then calculated by the dyson equation in spin space , @xmath67 where @xmath29 is given by eq.([hp1 ] ) . after applying the double - time fourier transform </S>",
    "<S> , the dyson equation can be summed up exactly to obtain the exact green s function of the model ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .    </S>",

    "<S> this result@xcite allows us to conclude that the charge current is still identically zero while the spin current is given by @xmath76 which is independent of time . </S>",
    "<S> these qualitative features are the same as those of the adiabatic limit discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> however , the non - adiabatic result ( [ particle1 ] ) involves processes with energies @xmath77 , as shown by the arguments of the green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that in the general non - adiabatic situation , many _ single _ photon processes are participating the operation of the sfet device .    </S>",

    "<S> we now apply the general principle of our sfet to a ( 5,5 ) armchair single wall carbon nanotube ( cnt ) with 200 unit cells which is contacted by two electrodes and gated by a third probe , as shown in the inset of fig.1 . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , the cnt is modeled with the nearest - neighbor @xmath78-orbital tight - binding model with bond potential @xmath79 ev for the carbon atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this model is known to give a reasonable , qualitative description of the electronic and transport properties of carbon nanotubes@xcite . using eq.([particle1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the spin current flowing out of the cnt sfet in the adiabatic regime can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 clearly , if @xmath82 , there is only one peak with @xmath83 . if @xmath84 , there are two peaks with @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that eq.([ns ] ) is the same as that of the andreev reflection coefficient in the presence of superconducting lead ( ns system ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as follows . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume a single probe connected to the scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> because of the rotating magnetic field , an incoming spin - up electron ( the electron in ns case ) is flipped down and pumped out as a spin - down electron ( the hole in ns case ) which is analogous to the andreev reflection . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the spin current @xmath86 versus the gate voltage @xmath10 for different @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( corresponds to 86 mhz in our units ) and @xmath89 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath90 corresponds to @xmath91 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> very similar results are obtained for other @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant spin current transport is clearly seen by which @xmath86 increases from practically zero to large values under the control of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 displays the spin current versus frequency using the nonadiabatic result eq.([particle1 ] ) , with @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity sets in at about @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> finally the inset of fig.2 depicts spin current as a function of @xmath92 with @xmath88 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current is rather substantial for a wide range of angles .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that a rotating magnetic field of uniform strength induces a spin current without a charge current , in coherent quantum conductors without needing any magnetic material . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current is critically tunable through the control of a resonance level in the system by an external gate voltage , thereby generating a field effect transistor operation . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind this phenomenon is the spin - flip mechanism by the external field , but is ultimately related to the quantum physics of the berry s phase@xcite . because spin current can be detected using an idea proposed by hirsch@xcite , the rotating frequency of the field needs not to be large , and the device structure is quite typical , we believe the sfet proposed here should be experimentally realizable . </S>"
