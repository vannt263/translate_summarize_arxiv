    "the high energy dynamics of qcd , described by the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) approach  @xcite , have been the subject of intense studies since four decades .",
    "the production of two forward jets separated by a large interval of rapidity at hadron colliders , as proposed by mueller and navelet  @xcite , is one of the most promising observable in order to reveal these dynamics .",
    "we here report on our study of this process in a next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) bfkl approach .",
    "the bfkl treatment involves two main building blocks , the jet vertex and the green s function .",
    "our complete nll bfkl analysis of mueller - navelet jets , including the nll corrections both to the green s function  @xcite and to the jet vertex  @xcite , demonstrated that the nll corrections to the jet vertex have a very large effect , leading to a lower cross section and a much larger azimuthal correlation  @xcite .",
    "however , these findings are very dependent on the choice of the scales , especially the renormalization scale @xmath0 and the factorization scale @xmath1 , a fact which remains true when using realistic kinematical cuts for lhc experiments  @xcite . in order to reduce this dependency",
    ", we then used the brodsky , lepage and mackenzie ( blm ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "the net result is that one can obtain a very satisfactory description  @xcite of the most recent lhc data extracted by the cms collaboration for the azimuthal correlations of these jets  @xcite .    after a recall of these nll results ,",
    "we discuss the relevance of energy - momentum conservation in our nll bfkl treatment .",
    "we then evaluate the importance of the potential contribution of multiparton interaction ( mpi ) .",
    "the production of two jets of transverse momenta @xmath2 , @xmath3 and rapidities @xmath4 , @xmath5 is described by the differential cross - section [ collinear ] & = & _ a , b _ 0 ^ 1 dx_1_0 ^ 1 dx_2f_a(x_1 ) f_b(x_2 ) + & & , where @xmath6 are the usual collinear partonic distributions ( pdf ) . in the bfkl framework ,",

    "an optimization procedure to fix the renormalization scale allows to reduce this dependency .",
    "we use the blm procedure  @xcite , which is a way of absorbing the non conformal terms of the perturbative series in a redefinition of the coupling constant , to improve the convergence of the perturbative series .",

    "one should note that in the very peculiar situation where the two jets are almost back - to - back , for which a fixed order calculation is unstable , resummation effects  la sudakov should be considered , to stabilize the calculation . in the bfkl approach , although this back - to - back limit is stable , the azimuthal distribution can be significantly affected by such resummation effects .",
    "these have been obtained recently in the ll approximation  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the ll calculation strongly overestimates the cross section for transverse momenta of the jets not too close . at nll accuracy",
    ", the situation is much improved for significantly different jet transverse momenta ( as needed to obtain trustable results in the fixed order approach ) : the effective rapidity is very close to @xmath45 so that the violation of energy - momentum should be much less severe at nll accuracy .",
    "at high energies and low transverse momenta where bfkl effects are expected to be enhanced , parton densities can become large enough that contributions where several partons from the same incoming hadron take part in the interaction could become important .",

    "@xcite for more details ) , for four different parametrizations .",

    "the other three choices correspond to the higher center of mass energy that the lhc is expected to reach soon .",
    "the last two choices correspond to lower transverse momenta at which measurements could become possible in the future , and are particularly relevant since mpi are expected to become more and more important at lower transverse momenta .",
    "the rapidities of the jets are restricted according to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we use the mstw 2008 parametrization  @xcite for collinear parton densities . to estimate the uncertainty associated with the choice of the ugd parametrization needed to compute the dps cross section",

    "our results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] .",
    "the resulting uncertainty on the dps cross section is rather large .",
    "still , this cross section is always smaller than the sps one in the lhc kinematics we considered here .",

    "it is only for the set of parameters giving the largest dps contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ at low transverse momenta and large rapidity separations , that the effect of dps can become larger than the uncertainty on the nll bfkl calculation .",
    "the azimuthal correlations of mueller - navelet jets recently extracted by the cms collaboration can be well described by a full nll bfkl calculation supplemented by the use of the blm procedure to fix the renormalization scale .",
    "we also studied two effects which are claimed to have a potential significant impact in this picture .",
