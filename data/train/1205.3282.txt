    "the fields of molecular electronics and charge transport through nanojunctions have been deeply investigated in the past fifteen years .",
    "@xcite at the experimental level many different techniques have been developed , including those based on break junctions , nanostructured and scanning probe layouts , or self - assembled monolayers .",
    "@xcite significant improvements in the accuracy with which these junctions are characterized have been achieved over the years , _ eg _ to address the i - v characteristics of single molecular junctions . moreover , a large experimental literature exists  @xcite on non - resonant tunneling experiments , where it is possible to determine the exponential decay ( @xmath1 ) of the current @xmath2 as a function of the length @xmath3 of the tunneling layer [ such as _ eg _ a layer of organic self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) connected to metallic electrodes ] .",
    "even though the @xmath1 parameter depends  @xcite also on the detailed nature of the interface , it carries mostly information about the properties of the tunneling layer itself , which makes @xmath1 an interesting analysis and characterization tool .",
    "experimentally , these measurements are performed using different setups , ranging from metal - insulator - metal ( mim ) junctions , as mentioned above , to the evaluation of kinetic constants of electro - transfer reactions ( optically or electrochemically induced ) in donor - bridge - acceptor molecular complexes .",
    "@xcite in terms of systems , measurements have been performed on a number of cases ranging from saturated olephins ( alkanes )  @xcite to biological molecules ( such as dna  @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , the electronic mechanism underlying these experiments has been analyzed and understood .",
    "@xcite as stated in ref .",
    "[ ] , the key parameter @xmath0 can be expressed ( _ eg _ in mim junctions ) in terms of ( @xmath4 ) the band gap @xmath5 and the ( frontier ) band widths ( or hopping parameter ) @xmath6 of the insulating layer , and ( @xmath7 ) the alignment of the fermi level in the metals with the energy gap of the insulator .",
    "indeed , the effect of the electronic structure of the insulating layer can be singled out by evaluating  @xcite the complex band structure ( cbs ) , or evanescent states , in the limit of an infinitely long insulating region .",
    "the cbs approach is also particularly interesting for an _ ab initio _ evaluation of @xmath0 , where the calculations can be performed either using wavefunction-  @xcite or green s function - based  @xcite approaches . a cartoon describing the relation between the electronic structure of the mim junction and the evaluation of the @xmath0-decay factor is given in fig .",

    "the computed value to be compared with experiments is highlighted as @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the fermi energy of the mim junction.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    nevertheless , since the @xmath0 parameter can be  @xcite directly related to the ratio between the energy gap and the band width of the insulator layer , the accuracy of standard electronic - structure simulations based on the kohn - sham ( ks ) framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) can be questioned .",
    "in fact , using eigenvalues computed from ks - dft it is well known that the fundamental band gap is badly underestimated and ( when using local and semilocal approximations ) the delocalization of electronic states is typically overestimated .",
    "moreover , the description of this class of experiments in terms of single particle energies would require them to be interpreted as quasi - particle energies , in order to address the electronic dynamics of the system .",
    "this is valid for advanced mbpt methods ,  @xcite such as hedin s gw approximation ,  @xcite and , at least in a perturbative sense , also for hartree - fock calculations .",
    "however , dft kohn - sham states are fictitious orbitals with no direct physical interpretation , and their use in this context can only be justified by the assumption that the exchange - correlation kernel is an approximation for the quasi - particle hamiltonian .",
    "model self - energies have also been recently  @xcite used to correct the electronic structure of metal - molecule - metal junctions and found to be important for the evaluation of @xmath0 .",
    "to date there has been no systematic investigation of the performance of different _ ab initio _ schemes in the calculation of the @xmath0 decay factors .",

    "the value @xmath1 which has to be compared with the experiments is the smallest one ( _ i.e. _ the most penetrating ) aligned with the fermi level of the junction : @xmath13 since the electrodes are not considered in the calculation , together with the proper metal - insulator interface , @xmath9 is not known a priori and must be either estimated or calculated separately .",

    "[ sec : results ] to fit and interpret the real and complex band - structures of the polymers we have investigated here .",
    "according to the above discussion , in order to simulate the decay coefficient of a mim junction , we need to compute the electronic structure of the insulating layer ( considered as infinitely extended ) .",
    "the underlying reason for this simplification is that we interpret the computed single - particle energies of the system as quasi - particle ( qp ) energies , which in turn determine the dynamics of singly charged excitations . in general",
    "the transport problem for interacting systems is more complicated than that and requires a more sophisticated treatment .   for dft ,",
    "the understanding of how the exact ks - dft hamiltonian performs to compute transport has been recently the subject of several investigations .",
    "@xcite apart from the properties of the exact functional , currently available dft approximations like lda or gga have been demonstrated to systematically overestimate the conductance , especially for off - resonant junctions .",
    "@xcite pragmatically , this suggests that corrections beyond local and semilocal ks - dft approaches are needed .    using qp - corrected electronic structure to compute charge transport ( _ eg _ by means of the landauer formula  @xcite ) through interacting systems",
    "seems to be a reasonable approximation when finite - lifetime effects are weak .",
    "@xcite indeed , a number of works computing qp energies by means of the gw approximation  @xcite or model self - energies  @xcite have been reported in the literature . on the other hand ,",
    "hybrid - exchange functional methods like b3lyp  @xcite or pbe0  @xcite are widely used and lead to band gaps and band widths which are usually closer  @xcite to the experimental values than simple semi - local ks approaches , for both molecules and solids .",
    "recent works  @xcite have further investigated the accuracy of hybrid exchange functionals , also in comparison with gw calculations . in this work",
    "we compare gw and hybrid functionals for the calculation of electronic structure and transport properties of selected organic polymers . in the following",
    "we summarize the gw approximation and underline some formal similarities with hybrid functionals .",
    "a many - body theoretical formulation of the electronic structure problem can be obtained by using the green s function formalism .",
    "the one - particle excitation energies of an interacting system are the poles of its interacting green s function @xmath40 ,  @xcite which can be written as : @xmath41^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is an effective single particle hamiltonian and @xmath43 is the non - local , non - hermitean , frequency dependent self - energy operator . in general",
    ", @xmath44 is not known _ a priori _ and must be approximated . in this work",
    "the self - energy is computed within the gw approximation :  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the screened coulomb interaction evaluated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . for more details see e.g. refs .",
    "[ ] . in the simplest implementation of the gw approximation , the self - energy is computed non self - consistently , _",
    "i.e. _ by evaluating @xmath47 and @xmath48 according to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a reference non - interacting hamiltonian ( typically the ks hamilotonian at the lda or gga level )",
    ". such a procedure is known as @xmath49 and gives reasonable results for the quasiparticle energies in a number of cases .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we exploit the @xmath49 approximation , and evaluate the frequency integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_gw ] ) by using a plasmon pole model according to godby and needs .",
    "@xcite    in this work , the main quantities we are interested in are the qp energies . if we neglect finite lifetime effects and take ( or symmetrize ) the self - energy to be hermitean , qp energies are given by first order perturbation theory as : @xmath50 as customary ,  @xcite in order to solve for @xmath51 , the self - energy in the above equation is expanded to first order as a function of @xmath26 .    in order to get more physical insight",
    "we also refer to the ( static ) cohsex  @xcite approximation of gw , where the self - energy is written as @xmath52 : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the one particle density matrix , and @xmath55 is the dynamical contribution to @xmath56 ( being @xmath57 the bare coulomb interaction ) .",
    "the cohsex self - energy is thus the sum of a statically screened exchange term and a local potential .",
    "this partition is particularly useful for discussing the connection between hybrid exchange functionals and gw . in the former case , the potential can be written as :  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the non - local exchange potential , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 are local potentials .",
    "it is then straightforward to interpret @xmath62 as an inverse effective screening to stress the formal analogy of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_sex][eq : sigma_coh ] ) and ( [ eq : hybrids_energy ] ) .",
    "similar considerations are of course valid for more complex forms of hybrid functionals , like range separated or local formulations .  @xcite this formal analogy is well - known in the literature ,  @xcite and it has also been further investigated recently .",
    "@xcite besides their accuracy for thermochemistry , this analysis highlights that also the electronic structure computed by non - local hybrids can benefit from the inclusion of some screened exchange term .",
    "indeed , improved description of the electronic structure for finite and extended systems are typically found ,  @xcite even though the accuracy may vary significantly depending on the system .      dealing with periodic systems , interpolation over the first brillouin zone ( 1bz )",
    "is a long standing issue .",
    "calculations are typically performed by discretizing @xmath15-points in the 1bz , and some post - processing schemes [ such as _ eg _ those to compute density - of - states ( dos ) , fermi surface , band structure , or phonons ] might need a better discretization of 1bz than some of the previous steps ( often aimed at computing total energy , forces , and charge density ) .",
    "this is particularly critical when the computational requirements of the adopted methods limit the @xmath15-point discretization , as is the case for gw calculations .",
    "schemes able to refine or interpolate  @xcite over the 1bz are particularly useful for this purpose .",
    "one of these is the _ wannier interpolation _ ,",
    "@xcite where the localization of the wannier function ( wf ) basis together with the finite range in real space of the hamiltonian are used to perform a fourier interpolation of the eigenvalues , and eventually eigenvectors .",
    "the use of this scheme to interpolate gw results has been also reported elsewhere by hamann and vanderbilt .",
    "@xcite    the procedure can be applied not only to the hamiltonian , but in principle to any operator @xmath63 with the translational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "first , we define the projector @xmath64 over a subspace of interest : @xmath65 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath66 .",
    "when the subspace @xmath64 is complete , we can represent @xmath67 as : @xmath68 here , @xmath67 is diagonal with respect to the @xmath15-index because it commutes with the translation operators of the direct lattice ( as assumed ) . in practice , limiting the number of eigenstates of @xmath66 included in @xmath64 is equivalent to considering the projection of @xmath67 on the @xmath64 subspace , namely @xmath69 instead of @xmath67 . at this point",
    "we can use the definition of maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf s ) , according to ref .",

    "this means that in the general case the final representation of @xmath67 is actually not projected on @xmath64 but on the smaller subspace spanned by the wfs .    assuming that @xmath74 is decaying fast enough in real space to have @xmath75 for @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is within the finite set compatible with the initial @xmath15-point grid )",

    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] . assuming that at low bias the current is carried by the states close to the fermi level of the junction",
    ", we basically need to know how these states decay into the insulating region ( the polymer , in the present case ) .",
    "once the cbs is known , either the fermi level alignment is computed explicitly or it is estimated on the basis of physical considerations . while the direct calculation is feasible ( but demanding ) and in some cases necessary , it is also possible to give a first estimate of the fermi level according to the so - called migs ( metal - induced gap states ) theory .  @xcite",
    "as proposed by tersoff ,  @xcite if the metal dos around the fermi level is sufficiently featureless and the migs penetrate deep enough in the insulating region , the fermi level of the metal - insulator junction is approximately pinned at the charge - neutrality level ( often close to the midgap point ) in order to avoid charge imbalance at the interface .",
    "the charge neutrality level can be easily identified from the cbs , as the energy where @xmath12 reaches its maximum inside the gap . from this perspective",
    ", @xmath85 is a first estimate of the experimental @xmath0 decay . in general ,",
    "the fermi level will move from the charge neutrality level , and the @xmath0 decay will change accordingly .",
    "the physical reasons leading the fermi level to shift are mostly related to the charge transfer ( and dipole formation ) at the interface .",
    "this explains why different chemical linking groups on the same molecule may lead to different values of @xmath0 .",
    "in general , the @xmath85 value computed from the cbs may be regarded as an upper bound for @xmath0 and thus as a lower bound for the ability of the insulating layer to allow the current to tunnel through the junction .",
    "the above discussion stresses the fact that the experimentally measured @xmath0 does not in general depend  @xcite only on the electronic structure of the insulator ( especially the cbs ) , but also on the details of the interface ( which determines the position of the fermi level ) .",
    "for instance , recent measurements on alkanes ( oligomers of pe ) determined a @xmath0 decay length of 0.710.76 @xmath99 for for -nh@xmath93 terminations ,  @xcite while it has been found in the range 0.80.9 @xmath99 ( and more disperse ) for thiolated molecules .",
    "@xcite recent calculations confirm this picture also for conjugated polymers connected to gold leads through different chemical groups .",
    "@xcite in that work , the authors have studied a number of oligomers including oligo - phenylenes ( whose infinite polymer is poly - para - phenylene , ppp ) . in the case of the molecule connected to gold leads via thiol groups , after investigating the interface - dos projected on the molecule , they find that the fermi level aligns close to the midgap point ( reasonably the charge neutrality level considered here ) , off by few tenths of ev ( @xmath1150.2 - 0.3 ev , the molecular gap being about 2 ev ) at the lda level .",
    "since the basic unit of ppp ( a phenyl ring ) is the same as part of the monomers forming ppv and ppi , we assume the charge neutrality condition to be almost fulfilled if we were considering au - ppv - au and au - ppi - au junctions with thiol anchoring .",
    "we can thus estimate @xmath85 to be a good estimate of @xmath0 , keeping in mind that the a small deviation from midgap would slightly decrease @xmath0 .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite reported @xmath0 = 0.3 @xmath99 for oligomers of ppi connected to gold through thiols .",
    "this number is in very good agreement with the value @xmath85 = 0.29 @xmath99 we found for ppi using pbe0 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : betas_ppi ] ) . according to our findings for pa and ppv ( see tabs .  [",
    "tab : betas_pa],[tab : betas_ppv ] ) , gw should give results for @xmath0 comparable to pbe0 , but slightly larger . in order to compare with other existing ( experimental and theoretical ) results for oligo - phenylenes ( ppp in the infinite limit )  @xcite we would need to address separately the issue of the fermi level alignment ( tending to decrease @xmath0 wrt the ideal @xmath85 ) and that of the phenyl twist - angle ( which goes in the direction of increasing @xmath0 ) .",
    "this will be the subject of future work .",
    "coming to the case of pa , we note that recent experimental results  @xcite report @xmath0-values of 0.22 @xmath99 for molecules similar to oligo - acetylenes . while this number is in very good agreement with our gw ( and pbe0 ) results for pa@xmath86 ( and consistent with pa@xmath105 , see tab .",
    "[ tab : betas_pa ] ) , the large variability of @xmath0 with the structural parameters of pa does not allow us to be conclusive on the assessment of the theory vs the experiment for this specific case . nevertheless , our findings suggest that the use of pbe0 or gw results , together with a proper determination of the fermi level alignment , will provide a reasonable approximation",
    ". we also note that gap underestimation and _ a priori _ assumption of the validity of the migs theory tend to partly cancel each other , and fortuitous agreement of experimetally measured @xmath0 values with lda calculations may occur .",
