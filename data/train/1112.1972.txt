    "the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) was a nasa - supported astronomical observatory that operated from 1999 to 2007 , acquiring far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; 905  1188  ) spectra at moderate spectral resolution ( r@xmath010000 * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "_ fuse _ was used to observe a variety of galactic and extragalactic targets , resulting in numerous scientific contributions in the areas of cosmology , galaxy structure , star formation and evolution , and planet formation .    during its operational lifetime , _ fuse _ was used to observe 99 different cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) over a total of 211 observations .",
    "cvs are mass - exchanging binary systems in which a late - type donor star transfers mass to a white dwarf ( wd ) . in most cvs ,",
    "mass transfer occurs via an accretion disk around the wd .",
    "the properties of cvs are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "cvs are divided into a number of sub - classes .",
    "first , they are distinguished between magnetic and non - magnetic systems . in magnetic cvs ,",
    "the wd field strengths are large enough ( b@xmath1100  kg ) to partially or completely disrupt the accretion disk . in non - magnetic cvs",
    ", the systems are divided between those systems that show semi - regular outbursts in the accretion disk ( dwarf novae ; dn ) and those that do not ( novalikes ; nls ) .    cvs provide an excellent population of nearby , non - obscured targets in which to study the physics of mass accretion @xcite .",
    "accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysical accretion , from compact binaries and proto - stars to the the central engines of active galaxies .",
    "cvs provide a way to probe disk accretion in multiple configurations and under a variety of stimuli .",
    "the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) in particular is an excellent window through which to view the accretion disk , disk outflows , and the wd accretor in cvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in high accretion rate systems ( dn in outburst and nls ) ,",
    "the accretion disk can reach temperatures of up to @xmath060,000  k @xcite and the disk sed typically peaks in the fuv . as a result",
    ", the fuv is a sensitive indicator of the inner disk structure and the mass accretion rate onto the wd .",
    "the fuv is also rich in spectral lines in a variety of species and ionization states that target the temperature and ionization structure of the disk , disk outflows , and the magnetically - channeled accretion column in magnetic cvs .    in low state systems ( quiescent dn and some magnetic cvs )",
    ", the fuv continuum is often dominated by the wd .",
    "the spectrum of the wd contains clues to the evolutionary and accretion history of the binary . in the fuv",
    ", the wealth of spectral lines allows for determinations of metal abundances on the wd surface , which often show anomalies indicative of cno processing of the accreted material , an artifact of the binary evolution in the system .",
    "moreover , the physical properties of the interaction region between the accretion disk and the wd in cvs ( the boundary layer ) remains poorly understood @xcite . at longer wavelengths it can be difficult to distinguish the spectrum of the wd from that of the disk , but observations at fuv wavelengths",
    "give the opportunity to determine the properties of the wd , the quiescent disk , and the boundary layer",
    "low - state cvs also show rich emission line spectra @xcite .",
    "the emission lines are usually assumed to originate in a chromosphere above the disk , but the location and properties of the line - emitting region and the vertical structure of the accretion disk are not well determined .",
    "fuv spectroscopy places important constraints on the properties of the line - emitting region .",
    "most of the analysis of cvs in the fuv to date has proceeded on a case - by - case basis . while intensive studies of individual systems are necessary ,",
    "it is also important to complement that work with a broad survey of the fuv properties of cvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by discerning broad trends",
    ", we can place the behavior of individual systems in context and determine which characteristics of compact binaries determine their observational properties . in quiescent systems ,",
    "a survey of targets can facilitate separation of the wd component from the disk and chromospheric components and help to determine the structure and physical extent of the latter",
    ". for high state systems , observations of a wide range of systems allow us to determine the distribution of vertically extended material in accretion disks . in all systems ,",
    "a broad survey is necessary to analyze the relative fuv contributions of and trends in the properties of the accretion disk , winds , and the wd as a function of the viewing inclination , binary geometry , mass accretion rate , wd magnetic field strength , and evolutionary history .",
    "to enable a broad survey of the fuv properties of cvs , we present a complete atlas of the _ fuse _ observations of cvs .",
    "this is the first large survey of the uv properties of cvs since the iue atlas of @xcite , and the first to cover the fuv wavelengths below ly@xmath2 .",
    "the time - averaged spectra of all the observations are available at the multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) as a high level science product .",

    "the _ fuse _ telescope collected data simultaneously in four optical channels : lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , and sic2 .",
    "the optical elements in the lif1 and lif2 channels were coated with aluminum plus lithium fluoride to maximize sensitivity at wavelengths @xmath31050    while the sic1 and sic2 channels were coated with silicon carbide for best performance @xmath41020   .",
    "each channel consisted of two non - contiguous segments ( e.g. , lif1a , lif1b , etc . ) .",
    "together , the eight segments covered the overall wavelength range of the instrument ( 9051187   ) with some overlap .",
    "the detectors consisted of two micro - channel plate devices , with the lif1 and sic1 spectra falling on one detector , and the lif2 and sic2 spectra on the other .",
    "_ fuse _ had three observing apertures .",
    "most of the observations made with _",
    "fuse _ used the lwrs aperture ( @xmath5 ) although a few cvs were observed through the mdrs aperture ( @xmath6 ) ; these exceptions are noted in tables  [ tab_list ] .",
    "the high resolution aperture ( hirs ; @xmath7 ) was rarely used because of difficulties in maintaining co - alignment of the four optical channels to the required precision . the design and performance of _ fuse _",
    "is presented in detail in the _ fuse _ archival instrument handbook .",
    "the default observation mode was the  time - tag \" observing mode , in which individual photon arrival events were recorded .",
    "the x and y positions on the detector were recorded as well as the pulse height of each event .",
    "a time stamp was inserted into the data stream every second , resulting in a relative accuracy of timing of 1 second .",
    "time - tag mode was the preferred observing mode because the resulting photon list could be screened to correct for bad time intervals , variable background , etc .",
    "the instrument data recorder could not store the full time - tag list when count rates exceeded 2500 counts sec@xmath8 , however . for targets with higher count rates ,",
    "the data were recorded in spectral image , or histogram , mode , in which spectral images were built up on board the telescope and downloaded as an integrated image .",
    "the individual photon events were not preserved .",
    "targets observed in this mode are labeled as  hist \" observations in tables  [ tab_list ] , while time - tag observations are labeled  ttag . \"",
    "we retrieved all of the _ fuse _ observations of cvs from the multimission archive ( mast ) at space telescope science institute .",
    "spectra acquired before 2003 january were reduced using calfuse v2.4 , the _ fuse _ data reduction pipeline .",
    "all spectra acquired after that date were reduced using calfuse v3.2 .",
    "( both versions of calfuse produce consistent spectral outputs , except in the case of background subtraction of faint targets ; see below . ) a detailed description of calfuse is given by @xcite .",
    "for each dataset , we inspected the data products ( images of the count rate and aperture placement for each exposure and extracted spectra for each observation ) to identify any problems with the observation and to ensure that the pipeline correctly screened out bad time intervals . for time - tag data , we combined the individual exposures in each segment using the calfuse tool ` ttag_combine ` .",
    "we then combined the eight time - averaged segment spectra into a single broadband spectrum using the idl - based tool ` fuse_analysis ` , provided on the _ fuse _ website . using the overlapping wavelength regions , we cross - correlated the spectra to correct for small wavelength offsets between channels and then combined the spectra , weighting by the error bars in each channel .",
    "we also screened out bad spectral regions as needed ( see below ) .",
    "the time - averaged spectra were binned to 0.1   . finally , we combined spectra from different observations if they were acquired close in time and if there were no gross changes in the spectrum between the observations .",
    "when examining the calfuse data products , we were searching for the effects of several consistent issues that appeared during _ fuse _ observations . for more information ,",
    "see @xcite and the _ fuse _ data handbook . here",
    "we discuss how we handled these effects for this survey :    1 .   jitter and channel drift : until 2005 , telescope guiding was performed using a fine error sensor that imaged reflected light from the front surface of the lif1 aperture block . after july 2005 ,",
    "the prime guide channel was switched to lif2 .",
    "while objects generally remained well - centered in the aperture of the optical channel used for guiding , the objects could drift out of apertures of the other three channels , causing partial or total loss of target throughput .",
    "both long term drifts ( especially early in the mission ) and more rapid jitter took place .",
    "the longer term drifts were primarily due to changes in the thermal environment while the jitter was primarily due to true pointing jitter .",
    "for the latter , engineering information was used by calfuse to remove periods when the instrument was not in the aperture . in general , the jitter screening was accurate , although in inspecting the count rate plots , we occasionally found instances where the jitter screening intervals were too narrow compared to the actual drop in count rates .",
    "we corrected for this and for cases of drift where the target was still partially in the aperture by scaling the output spectra to the flux of the spectrum in the guide channel . in some cases ,",
    "an exposure was so heavily screened for drift that we would remove the exposure from the time - averaged spectrum entirely rather than keep a few tens of seconds of marginal data .",
    "event bursts : _ fuse _ regularly detected ",
    "event bursts , \" large count rate events that were transient but could affect parts or all of one or more detectors .",
    "the source of the bursts is unknown .",
    "calfuse detects and screens out bursts in time - tag observations by removing periods when the detected counts varied by more than five standard deviations from the mean count rate . in general",
    ", we found the burst detection procedure in calfuse to be accurate , so we rarely had to perform additional screening .",
    "background subtraction : for faint targets ( continuum @xmath9 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath8 @xmath8 ) , calfuse often failed to properly subtract the background .",
    "this was particularly true for the final version of calfuse , v3.2 , which used a three - component background model ( a uniform component , daytime scattered airglow , and nighttime scattered light ) that was often severely underconstrained for fainter targets .",
    "the background subtraction was most inclined to fail on the less sensitive sic channels or on the edges of the lif channels where sensitivity dropped off ( especially @xmath11   ) . because the background contained both uniform and wavelength - dependent components",
    ", we were unable to easily correct for poor background subtraction ( by , for example , setting the flux below the lyman limit to 0 ) .",
    "instead , we screened out regions that were unsuccessfully corrected .",
    "we regularly screened out the short wavelength ends of the lif channels and the sic1a and sic2b segments , where we already had better coverage in the lif channels .",
    "we also screened out the other sic segments for the faintest targets , leaving only the lif channel coverage .",
    "detector voltages : occasionally no data were recorded on one or more detectors because they had been set to saa , or low , voltage after single event upsets .",
    "we have noted such cases in the appendices .",
    "the worm : in order to improve quantum efficiency , sets of grid wires were placed just above the microchannel plates used in the detectors for _",
    "fuse_. however , for certain positions of the target spectrum on the detector , the qe grid wires can shadow parts of the detectors , adversely affecting the flux calibration in these regions . the most prominent feature , or  worm , \" was located on the lif1b segment .",
    "the problem was not easy to calibrate out because the amount of shadowing depended on exactly where the spectrum was on the detector ( see , for example , fig .",
    "11 of dixon et al . ) . in most cases , we screened out the affected part of the lif1b spectrum by comparing it to the lif2a spectrum at the same wavelengths . in a few cases , we could not do this because of lack of data in lif2 due to channel drift or low detector voltages . in those cases",
    ", we left the lif1b spectrum uncorrected .",
    "the lists of cvs observed using _ fuse _ is given in table  [ tab_list ] .",
    "the table lists the object name , cv subtype , and orbital period and inclination ( where known ) for each target .",
    "the cv subtypes are given using the standard nomenclature as outlined in catalogs such as that of @xcite .",
    "information about the systems was taken first from the catalog of ritter & kolb @xcite and second ( if needed ) from the catalog of downes @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the classifications of individual systems can change in light of new observational data ; these changes may not propagate to the general catalogs immediately . for each observation",
    ", we provide the data i d , start date , final exposure time ( after calfuse screening ) , a flag indicating whether the observation was taken in time - tag or histogram mode , and a data quality estimate .",
    "finally , we provide comments for certain observations ( such as those observed in the mdrs channel ) and a list of published references for each target .",
    "we have made the combined , time - averaged spectra available on mast as a high level science product ( hlsp ) : _ fuse _ survey of cataclysmic variables .",
    "all of the spectra and plots of the data can be downloaded from the mast hlsp archive .",
    "the hlsp also includes details about the data calibration process for each target , particularly flagging cases where observational or calibration issues as discussed above affect the final data product .",
    "figures  [ fig_nonmags ] and  [ fig_mags ] show the non - magnetic and magnetic cvs , respectively , observed by _ fuse_. the spectra are given in lexicographical order .",
    "we do not show an object spectrum if the signal to noise was low and we only show one spectrum per object unless the spectra changed dramatically between observations .",
    "the remaining spectra in the survey can be viewed on the mast hlsp pages .",
    "perhaps the key unifying characteristic of the fuv spectra of the cvs observed using _ fuse _ is their complexity .",
    "virtually every component of the system , with the exception of the cool donor star , is expected to emit in the fuv . as a result ,",
    "the fuv spectra are often superpositions of accretion disk , wd , and disk winds , with continuum and lines from multiple components .",
    "the fuv bandpass is rich in spectral features of a variety of species and ionization levels .",
    "many of these features , particularly of ionized species , appear in the spectra of cvs in both absorption and in emission ( often in the same system ) . typically , the lines are broad , with fwhm of hundreds of km  s@xmath8 . in table",
    "[ tab_lines ] we identify spectral features intrinsic to the cvs that have been seen in _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "the spectra also show narrow absorption lines from neutral species originating in the interstellar medium along the lines of sight to the targets . in table",
    "[ tab_ism ] we list the interstellar atomic transitions commonly seen in the _ fuse _ spectra of cvs .",
    "observable cvs are nearby objects , and therefore most do not show strong absorption from interstellar h@xmath12 , which appears in the _ fuse _ band and it nearly ubiquitous in _ fuse _ spectra of other targets .",
    "typically , when molecular h does appear in cvs , one sees only weak , unsaturated lines . however , there are exceptions , such as the spectrum of v  sge ( figure  [ fig_vsge ] ) , which shows strong , saturated h@xmath13 absorption . finally , most spectra show emission lines from terrestrial airglow .",
    "detailed information about fuv airglow emission can be found in @xcite .    in the following sections , we discuss the characteristics of the _ fuse _ cv survey as a function of cv subtype .",
    "thirty - eight dn were observed using _",
    "fuse_. thirty - seven of the systems were observed in quiescence .",
    "one system ( rx  and ) was caught only in its outburst state .",
    "for some of the systems , particularly those observed in extended _ fuse _ campaigns ( e.g. , ss  cyg , u  gem , vw  hyi , and wz  sge ) , we know when the dn were in quiescence from ground - based monitoring carried out by organizations such as the aavso .",
    "for the other systems , we classified the observations as being in quiescence based on their fluxes and spectral shapes : e.g. , relatively faint fluxes , flat or red continua , emission spectra and/or absorption lines characteristic of a wd .",
    "the quiescent dn spectra can be broadly divided into two categories : those that show broad absorption in the lyman lines and narrower absorption in some metal lines , and those that have flat continua and emission lines .",
    "the former are those systems in which the wd dominates the fuv spectrum while in the latter , emission from the accretion disk obscures the wd signatures . figures  [ fig_dnwd ] and  [ fig_dnem ] show examples of the two categories .",
    "there is overlap between the two cases , of course , including emission lines in `` wd spectra '' ( such as the emission in ww  cet ) and `` emission line systems '' with signatures that suggest an underlying wd component ( such as the absorption core in @xmath141175 in ru  peg ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_dnwd ] shows the spectra for several wd - dominated systems in order of decreasing wd temperature .",
    "the wd temperatures are from single - component wd model fits to the spectra .",
    "wz  sge had just entered quiescence after a superoutburst when the _ fuse _ spectrum was taken and the wd model fit gives a temperature of t@xmath15 = 23,000  k ; the temperature late in quiescence is lower , t@xmath1616,000  k @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous papers devoted to fitting wd models to _ fuse _ spectra of quiescent dn ( see the citations in table  [ tab_list ] ) .",
    "the aims of these studies have been to obtain wd parameters ( temperatures , masses , gravities ) , decompose the multiple emission sources in the systems ( including multiple components on the wd surface ) , trace the effects of active accretion on the structure of the boundary layer and the wd atmosphere , and probe how the wd responds to enhanced accretion after outbursts .",
    "one consistent conclusion of these projects is that the fuv spectra are often better fit by multi - component models than single temperature wd models . in some cases",
    ", the spectra are fit with two - temperature wd models , interpreted as the bulk of the wd having one temperature while some fraction of the wd surface is hotter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation for this picture is that a hot `` accretion belt '' is spun up on the wd surface by the accretion of disk material @xcite .",
    "however , none of the data have shown unambiguous evidence of rapid rotation uniquely consistent with a belt , leaving the source of the second component unconstrained @xcite .",
    "other analyses have used wd plus steady - state accretion disk models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although generally the inclusion of the disk component does not improve the fit ( see below for more discussion on this point ) .",
    "@xcite followed vw  hyi through decline from a superoutburst to the next normal outburst .",
    "they found that the fuv spectrum is dominated by the wd , which cools during the interoutburst period .",
    "they also found that two additional components were necessary to model the spectrum : a variable component modulated on the orbital period , modeled by a thermal spectrum , and attributed to the hot spot ; and a third component that appears long after outburst and is composed of emission lines plus a pseudocontinuum , which they attributed to the disk .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , pointed to the boundary layer as the source of the additional emission in vw  hyi .",
    "a number of systems , including u  gem , vw  hyi , ey  cyg , ch  uma , and ss  aur , show abundance anomalies indicative of cno processing in the accreted material .",
    "the source of the abundance differences from solar abundance ratios are not known but have been attributed either to nuclear evolution of the donor star or to pollution of the donor by previous nova explosions @xcite . to date , the only definitive abundance variations are decreased ( relative to solar ) carbon and enhanced nitrogen in the fuv spectra , but there are hints that other elements may show abundance anomalies ( e.g. , low si in ss  aur ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that will help distinguish between the models .",
    "figure  [ fig_dnem ] shows examples of emission line - dominated quiescent dn .",
    "ex  dra has a unique spectrum consisting of strong line emission and little to no continuum .",
    "its binary inclination ( @xmath17 ) is such that the system is nearly edge - on and is therefore dominated by the emission line region , typically ascribed to a photoionized accretion disk chromosphere ( though this region and indeed the vertical structure of low - state disks in general is poorly understood ) .",
    "the other quiescent dn with emission line spectra are more similar to each other .",
    "they exhibit strong , broad emission lines , particularly in , , and , and flat to blue continua .",
    "the sources of the continuum emission are difficult to characterize .",
    "@xcite , for example , fit the spectrum of ru  peg with a 53,000  k wd , but the model did not fit the spectrum well , particularly in the blue . they were unable to improve the fit by switching to a steady - state accretion disk model or a hybrid wd / disk model .",
    "the lack of robust descriptions of the structure and properties of quiescent accretion disks hinders modeling efforts : eclipse maps of eclipsing quiescent dn show that their disks are not in a steady state @xcite , so it is unsurprising that steady - state disk models do not provide good descriptions of the fuv continuum spectrum . as a result ,",
    "successful models of the fuv spectra of emission line dominated systems remain elusive .",
    "( for a more detailed discussion on this point , see long et al .  2005 . )",
    "rx  and , ss  cyg , ab  dra , u  gem , vw  hyi , wz  sge , and hs1857 + 7127 were observed in outburst .",
    "their outburst states were confirmed by examining their aavso light curves for all targets but the last .",
    "the aavso observations of hs1857 + 7127 are too sparse to confirm its optical state , but the 2007 mar 09 _ fuse _ spectrum was @xmath010 brighter than the previous one taken on 2006 sep 13 and is probably an outburst observation . for ss  cyg ,",
    "u  gem , vw  hyi , and wz  sge , _ fuse _ obtained extended campaigns tracking the cvs through outburst and decline .",
    "the vw  hyi campaign observed the system both in superoutburst and in the subsequent normal outburst .",
    "fig  [ fig_dno ] shows the outburst spectra for six systems .",
    "the u  gem , vw  hyi , and wz  sge observations from outburst to quiescence have been analyzed individually in previous papers @xcite .",
    "taken as a set , the intrinsic fuv spectra of the dn in outburst show both morphological similarities and variations .",
    "ss  cyg , rx  and , and vw  hyi are similar , with spectra characterized by fairly flat continua longward of 1000   , declining fluxes in the blue , and strong , broad ( fwhm@xmath010005000  km  s@xmath8 ) absorption lines of and metals .",
    "the u  gem and hs1857 + 7127 spectra have flat continua over the full _ fuse _ range punctuated by relatively narrow ( fwhm@xmath18 500  km  s@xmath8 ) absorption lines in and ionized metals .",
    "the ab  dra spectrum is noisy ( it was only observed for 600 sec and has interstellar molecular h@xmath13 contamination ) but the and @xmath141175 lines are broad and blueshifted .",
    "finally , the wz  sge spectrum has a flat continuum with a combination of absorption and emission components , punctuated by very strong , broad emission in .",
    "many of the morphological variations can be ascribed to viewing inclination , which increases from more face - on to increasingly edge - on from top to bottom in figure  [ fig_dno ] .",
    "in particular , if the spectral line features are ascribed to a strong disk wind , then the transition from broad , blue - shifted absorption in ss  cyg , rx  and , and vw  hyi to the spectrum of wz  sge , which contains lines with p  cygni profiles ( , for example ) and the strong doublet emission profile , is consistent with the picture of a bipolar outflow seen in absorption against the disk continuum at low inclination and in emission in scattered light at high inclination .",
    "@xcite found a good fit to the spectrum of ss  cyg with a model consisting of a steady - state accretion disk plus a rotating , biconical disk wind , wherein roughly 1% of the accreted material escapes in the outflow .",
    "however , the spectra of u  gem and hs1857 + 7127 complicate the picture .",
    "their absorption spectra consist of narrow lines at low velocities ( @xmath19  km  s@xmath8 ) that vary on the orbital phase , which is inconsistent with an escaping wind . @xcite attributed the absorption in u  gem to vertically - extended material in the outer accretion disk , probably associated with a disk bulge or mass accretion stream overflow .    for ss  cyg , u  gem , and wz  sge , mass accretion rates in the disk at outburst peak have been determined using model fits of steady - state accretion disks to the fuv continuum , giving m@xmath20  yr@xmath8 , m@xmath21  yr@xmath8 , m@xmath22  yr@xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the outburst accretion rates of u gem and ss cyg , which both have periods above the period gap , are @xmath2358 times higher than that of the short - period wz sge . in all three cases ,",
    "the model disk spectra provided good qualitative fits to the continuum shape , with the exception of the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath24   ) , which shows excess emission in the observed spectra compared to the models .",
    "the discrepancy could be caused by an additional emission source , such as the boundary layer or the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the disk .",
    "the excess emission ( over a white dwarf component ) persists in quiescence in u  gem and vw  hyi ; in the latter , the excess component is modulated on the orbital phase , which leads @xcite to attribute it to the hot spot .",
    "thirty - two nls were observed .",
    "this total includes v  sge , which is classified as a cv but may instead be a colliding wind binary or a supersoft x - ray binary @xcite ; and cq  dra , which is a triple star system that has been classified as both a symbiotic star and a cv , with its x - ray properties favouring the former hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the nl designation for cvs is broad , encompassing any system that does not show dn outbursts and does not have signatures of the presence of a magnetic wd . as a result , it is not surprising that the fuv spectra of nls are among the most diverse and complex spectra of cvs observed by _",

    "ae  aqr is an unusual system in which the formation of the accretion disk is disrupted by a `` propeller '' mechanism caused by the rapidly rotating wd which ejects accreted matter from the system @xcite .",

    "although they found the accretion disk to be negligible in yy  dra , it may also contribute to the continuum in other systems .",

    "v405  aur is listed as a low - inclination target but its spectrum is more like that of the high - inclination systems , with a weak continuum and strong line emission . @xcite measured the radial velocity curve of 1032    in v405  aur and found a very low orbital radial velocity amplitude , @xmath48  km  s@xmath8 , from which they inferred an orbital inclination of @xmath49 . however , there are reasons to suspect that the radial velocity curve is inaccurate .",

    "<S> the _ fuse _ spectra are morphologically diverse . </S>",
    "<S> they show contributions from the accretion disk , the disk chromosphere , disk outflows , and the white dwarf , but the relative contribution of each component varies widely as a function of cv subtype , orbital period and evolutionary state , inclination , mass accretion rate , and magnetic field strength of the white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> the data reveal information about the structure , temperature , density and mass flow rates of the disk and disk winds , the temperature of the white dwarf and the effects of ongoing accretion on its structure , and the long - term response of the systems to disk outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the complete atlas of time - averaged _ fuse _ spectra of cvs are available at the multimission archive at space telescope science institute as a high level science product . </S>"
