    "upon breaking of spherical symmetry in an axial direction we arrive at cylindrical symmetry . a large number of systems fail to satisfy spherical symmetry and are considered within the context of cylindrical ( or axial ) symmetry .",

    "our interest in this study is to suppress the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependences and consider spacetimes depending only on the radial @xmath1 coordinate .",
    "this amounts to admit three killing vectors @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the weyl coordinates @xmath7 .",

    "topological defect spacetimes believed to form during the early universe such as cosmic strings @xcite also fit into this class .",
    "the latter s current - like source is located along an axis which creates a deficit angle in the surrounding space so that it gives rise to gravitational lensing .",
    "still another example for cylindrically symmetric metrics which is powered by a beam - like magnetic field is the melvin s magnetic universe @xcite .",
    "addition of extra fields such as brans - dicke scalar or various electromagnetic fields to the cylindrical metrics has been extensively searched in the literature bransdicke .",
    "recently we have given an example of weyl solution in which the magnetic melvin and bertotti - robinson metrics are combined in a simple einstein - maxwell metric @xcite .",
    "there is already a large literature related to the spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes ( tsw ) @xcite but for the cylindrically symmetric cases the published literature is relatively less @xcite . from this token",
    "we wish to consider a general class of cylindrically symmetric spacetimes in which the metric functions depend only on the radial function @xmath1 to construct tsws . as usual",
    ", our method is cutting and pasting of two cylindrically symmetric spacetimes which unlike the spherical symmetric cases are more restrictive toward asymptotic flatness .",

    "the parametric plotting of the second derivative of the potential @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the equilibrium radius , reveals the stability region for the tsw under consideration .",
    "our perturbation addresses only to the radial and linear cases for which we may adopt equations of state ( eos ) for the surface energy - momentum at the throat .",
    "adding extra source amounts to the fact that the covariant divergence of the surface energy - momentum is non - zero .",
    "the structural equations for perturbations expectedly are more complicated than the spherical symmetric case , which is natural from the less symmetry arguments . concerning the exotic/ normal matter , however",
    ", our formalism does not add anything new , i.e. our matter to thread the tsw is still exotic . in a recent study",
