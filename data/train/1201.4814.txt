    "recently , some hints of a relatively light higgs boson were announced by the cms and atlas collaborations  @xcite , with a mass somewhere between 120 and 130 gev .",
    "what may be most spectacular for masses in this range is the tiny width of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite:@xmath0 to be compared to @xmath1 for the sm gauge bosons .",

    "indeed , many models predict the existence of new light particles ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , for example as the pseudo - goldstone bosons of some spontaneous symmetry breaking , or as messengers towards a dark sector to which our world is only very weakly connected .",
    "provided these particles are neutral , colorless , and sufficiently weakly interacting , they could have escaped detection up to now ( and will thus be referred to as dark particles ) .",
    "this also ensures they do not affect the sm higgs boson production and decay rates into sm particles , but they could nevertheless open new decay channels .    the dark particles being very weakly interacting , they would show up as missing energy ( denoted as @xmath11 ) .",
    "in particular , they would enhance the invisible width of the higgs boson , @xmath12 .",
    "but , even if the total width gets enhanced by a factor of ten say , given the current and foreseeable experimental resolutions , it would still be beyond reach ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue ) . instead , it has to be inferred from the assumed higgs boson production rate , combined with a measured decay rate in a given sm channel .",
    "as said above , though both of these are model - dependent in general , the presence of a dark particle should affect neither of them .",
    "thus , a significant invisible decay rate would systematically suppress the branching ratios for the sm modes ( see table  [ hwidth ] ) , and in particular , no @xmath13 signal should have been glimpsed .    in this way",
    ", the tiny higgs boson width can be measured , and used to constrain the couplings to dark states .",
    "numerically , we take @xmath14 gev , and @xmath15 mev for definiteness , and will conservatively require the non - standard decay rates to be less than @xmath16 of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "but thanks to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , a naive dimensional analysis shows that this should suffice to probe relatively high np scales:@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the width of a two - body decay to dark particles induced by an effective operator of dimension @xmath20 .",
    "one should also keep in mind the possible improvement at the ilc , where production rates can be much cleaner than @xmath21 , and @xmath22 could be measured to a few percent precision  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to indirectly detect new light particles by measuring the invisible higgs boson width has already been studied quite extensively . however , most previous works require this new state to be the dark matter candidate . in that case ,",
    "tight bounds arise from dark matter detection experiments , or wmap data .",
    "in addition , the main focus is in general on the renormalizable couplings to the higgs boson , the so - called portals  @xcite .",
    "for example , the higgs portal was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the vector portal in ref .",
    "@xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite also included the non - renormalizable couplings to dark fermions .    in the present work",
    ", our goal is to study as generically as possible the impact a new light particle could have on the higgs boson width .",
    "so , we will extend previous studies in three directions :    1 .",
    "we will not impose any dark matter - based constraints .",
    "indeed , such a new light state need not be the dark matter candidate , but only has to live long enough to escape as missing energy at colliders .",
    "for instance , it could originate from some hidden sector , and depending on the dynamics going on there , may or may not ultimately decay into stable dark matter particles .",
    "our approach can thus be understood as a model - independent first step towards unravelling the dark sector dynamics .",
    "we will include all the relevant effective operators coupling a dark particle of spin  0 , 1/2 , 1 , or 3/2 ( denoted as @xmath23 ) to the sm , whether renormalizable or not .",
    "since these dark particles have evaded detection up to now , they have very weak couplings with sm particles .",
    "so , effectively , the dark states can be considered neutral under the full sm gauge group , and their interactions parametrized by gauge invariant effective operators .",
    "these have recently been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we will rely on that list quite extensively .",
    "we will not only include @xmath24 , but also all the other modes in which the dark states could play a role . indeed , future bounds on the partially visible branching ratios , with sm particles and missing energy in the final states , may be far better than @xmath25 , and would thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ reach ] ) , probe much higher np scales . to systematically investigate these signatures",
    ", we will retain separately the leading effective interactions involving the higgs boson alone , together with the sm gauge boson , and together with the sm fermions . in this latter case",
    ", we will also distinguish between baryon and lepton number conserving and violating interactions .",
    "our analysis is organized according to the higgs boson decay modes . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider purely invisible decays , @xmath26 with @xmath11 carried away by a pair of dark particles . in section 3 , we turn to modes involving a neutral gauge boson together with one or two dark particles , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these decay channels are further analyzed in section 4 , where the impact of a dark gauge symmetry , and of its breakdown , is studied . in section 5",
    ", we consider decay modes with sm fermions and dark particles in the final state .",
    "this includes @xmath29 modes , as well as the invisible and radiative decay processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 6 , where we also discuss the interpretation of our results in case the recent hint of a light higgs boson is not confirmed .",
    "because of the @xmath32 invariance , the simplest way to couple the higgs boson to a dark sm neutral state is through the combination@xmath33 where the higgs boson undergoes the shift @xmath34{c}0\\\\ v+h^{0}\\end{array } \\right )   \\;,\\;\\;v\\approx246\\;\\text{gev\\ .}\\ ] ] also , and throughout this work , we assume that the dark scale @xmath35 is larger than the electroweak scale , @xmath36 , so that @xmath37is small and a perturbative expansion in @xmath38 is valid .    with this , low - dimensional operators can be constructed for all types of invisible states  @xcite :    [ hh]@xmath39    where all the couplings are real except for @xmath40 , and one should substitute @xmath41 for majorana fermions .",
    "the super - renormalizable @xmath42 and renormalizable @xmath43 couplings in @xmath44 embody the so - called higgs portal  @xcite , while @xmath45 is part of the vector portal  @xcite .",
    "they are not suppressed by the np scale @xmath35 . in the present work , the scalar field",
    "is assumed to be charged under some dark quantum number , so that only @xmath43 occurs .",
    "all these operators induce simultaneously a correction to the invisible particle mass and an invisible @xmath24 decay mode .",
    "the interpretation of this correlation is different for spin  0 , @xmath46 and for spin  1 , @xmath47 states because for the latter , a mass term explicitly breaks a dark gauge invariance , so we analyze these two cases separately .",
    "the mass corrections and decay rates are simple to get from the effective interactions :    [ sspp]@xmath48    with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "the rate diverges if either @xmath113 or @xmath114 because the mass is only linearly dependent on @xmath115 .    of course , once we allow for the operators in eq .",

    "in addition , compared to the spin  0 and 1/2 cases , a direct link between @xmath127 and @xmath100 is quite possible , since both arise from a breaking of the dark gauge symmetry ( this will be further studied in section  4 ) .",
