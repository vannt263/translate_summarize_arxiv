    "( [ eq : dsrz ] ) changes sign with @xmath453 , spin injection can be reduced or enhanced .",
    "finally , the large bias spin extraction will be affected , since it now depends not only on @xmath364 but also on @xmath237 .",

    "the spin current is determined by @xmath452 , which now reads @xmath473   \\\\ & - & \\delta n_p\\frac{\\exp\\left ( \\alpha_0\\zeta'\\tilde{w}_p/2\\right ) } { \\sinh\\left ( \\tilde{w}_p / l_{np\\zeta}\\right ) } .",

    "as in the case of slow spin relaxation , here too the i - v curve becomes explicitly dependent on magnetic drift .",
    "the strength of the magnetic drift is determined by the parameter @xmath475 , while the sign ( whether it will enhance or reduce the charge current ) on the sign of @xmath476 .",
    "the solar cell current coming from @xmath92 depends exponentially on @xmath453 .",
    "the same applies to spin injection .",
    "we have studied spin - polarized bipolar transport in magnetic _ p - n _ junctions under the general conditions of applied bias and externally injected ( source ) spin .",
    "we have introduced a model , by generalizing the successful shockley model of nonmagnetic _",
    "p - n _ junctions , to include spin - split bands and nonequilibrium spin . the model is valid only at low injection ( small biases ) , although it shows the trends of what to expect at large biases as well .",
    "our theory gives the carrier and spin density profiles in the bulk regions ( away from the depletion layer ) , and explicitly formulates the boundary conditions for the densities at the depletion layer .",
    "in analogy with the original shockley model we employ the condition of ( quasi ) thermal equilibrium across the depletion layer even when a bias is applied _ and _ a nonequilibrium spin is injected .",
    "however , the spin polarized case requires an additional condition to obtain all the relevant input parameters .",
    "this condition we formulate in terms of the continuity of the spin current across the depletion layer .",
    "the obtained boundary conditions allow us to generalize the standard diode formulas to the case of spin - polarized magnetic diodes , resulting in a new formulation of the i - v characteristics .",
    "although to explain the physics of bipolar spin - polarized transport we use spin polarized electrons only , we also give all the formulas needed to calculate the i - v curves for spin polarized holes as well ( in the appendix , where we also show how the equilibrium properties of _",
    "p - n _ junctions are modified in the presence of spin - split bands ) .",
    "we have applied our theory to several cases which we believe are important for spintronics .",
    "we demonstrate that only nonequilibrium spin can be injected across the depletion layer .",
    "effective spin injection from a magnetic into a nonmagnetic region , without a source spin , is not possible at small biases .",
    "we show how this claim is relaxed at large biases , which build up a nonequilibrium spin in the magnetic majority region , and then inject this spin into the nonmagnetic minority region .",
    "similarly , we demonstrate that spin can be extracted at large forward biases from the nonmagnetic majority region to the magnetic minority one .",
    "we also study spin injection by the minority carriers to the majority region .",
    "physically , this process can be described as spin pumping , since the resulting accumulation / amplification of spin in the majority region depends on the spin current of the minority carriers .",
    "the accumulated spin can be greater than the source spin , which in effect is a spin amplification .",
    "a realization of the spin - voltaic effect is found at the interface ( here the depletion layer ) between the minority magnetic region ( @xmath3 ) and the nonmagnetic but spin - polarized majority region .",
    "the spin - voltaic effect is demonstrated by the generation of charge current by nonequilibrium spin ( at no applied bias ) .",
    "this is also a spin - valve effect , since the direction of the charge current can be reversed by reversing an applied magnetic field .",
    "the spin induced nonequlibrium charge density is also the basis for the spin capacitance of the spin - polarized junctions@xcite as well as for the spin and magnetic field dependent charge capacitance of magnetic _ p - n _",
    "junctions.@xcite next we have studied ( source ) spin injection by the biasing electrode and shown that this is not a very effective means of spin injection , at least for a simple model considered .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that if the neutral regions have nonequilibrium band spin splitting , the resulting magnetic drift can significantly affect both the i - v characteristics of the junction and the junction spin injection capabilities .",
    "our theory is general enough to be applicable to various semiconductor spintronic devices operating under the conditions of small injection and nondegenerate carrier statistics .",
    "while we have already demonstrated the extensive generality of the theory by applying it to a large number of specific model device simulations , we envisage many more potential spintronic junction devices where our models will be useful .",
    "such devices can be , for example , bipolar spin junction transistors@xcite or spin thyristors , with great technological potentials , and where charge currents ( and their amplification ) can be controlled not only by bias , but also by nonequilibrium spin and magnetic field .",
    "however , to apply the theory to realistic device structures , many physical aspects of the model will need to be modified .",
    "in many cases the spin states of the carriers are not simple spin doublets , but rather multiplets , as a result of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in addition , the electron - hole recombination is , in general , spin selective , so if both electrons and holes are spin polarized , more realistic models for the recombination need to be introduced . furthermore , carrier recombination and spin relaxation depend on the carrier density , an effect which may be found important if ferromagnetic semiconductors are employed .",
    "other possible additions to the model may include a realistic treatment of spin relaxation ( and carrier recombination ) in the depletion layer and finite spin relaxation at the contact electrodes .",
    "structural modifications may include inhomogeneous magnetic doping ( or inhomogeneous magnetic fields ) also in the bulk regions , and schemes based on two or three dimensional spin bipolar transport . since , at the moment , there is a lack of experimental understanding of bipolar spin transport , theoretical modeling ( both analytical as presented here or numerical , which is of greater applicability , as reported in refs .  )",
    "is particularly important .",
    "we believe that although quantitative aspects of spin - polarized bipolar transport may be seriously modified , our theory captures the essential physics and the predicted phenomena are robust enough to be present in more realistic situations .",
    "to study equilibrium properties of magnetic _ p - n _ junctions we consider both electrons and holes spin polarized .",
    "denote the electron and hole spin densities as @xmath347 and @xmath457 , and reserve the second subscript ( if needed ) to denote the region .",
    "symbol @xmath477 denotes the equilibrium values . as in the main text ,",
    "the energies ( potentials ) are given in the units of @xmath68 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "further , denote as @xmath478 and @xmath479 the spin band splittings of the conduction and valence bands .",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath480 ( @xmath481 ) is positive when the spin up electrons ( holes ) have a lower energy than those in the spin down states .",
    "both electrons and holes are assumed in thermal equilibrium , obeying nondegenerate boltzmann statistics .",
    "the equilibrium carrier densities obey the law of mass action , now reading @xmath482 as a result , the minority carrier densities ( electrons in the @xmath3 region and holes in the @xmath1 region ) are @xmath483 similarly , the corresponding equilibrium spin densities are @xmath484 so that the equilibrium spin polarizations of electrons and holes are @xmath485 and @xmath486 . the built - in voltage , which is the electrostatic potential drop across the depletion layer depends on the band splittings ( thus on the equilibrium spin polarizations ) : @xmath487.\\ ] ]",
    "the built - in voltage is slightly reduced by the spin splitting .",
    "note that only the band splittings of the majority carriers affect the built - in field .",
    "the reason is that the chemical potentials in the bulk regions ( considered separately ) depend only on @xmath250 and @xmath488 : @xmath489 here @xmath490 is the chemical potential for the intrinsic ( undoped ) and unpolarized case . in making a junction , the built - in field arises upon equilibrating the two chemical potentials : @xmath491 .",
    "the band splitting does not affect the nondegeneracy of the carrier statistics , since the distance between the chemical potential and the lower conduction ( upper valence ) spin band does not change with @xmath415 at large @xmath415 .",
    "spin polarization of holes can be treated separately from that of electrons , since , in our model , electron and hole transport are independent ( only minority diffusion is considered ) , and the electron - hole recombination is spin independent ( in our simplified picture electrons of one spin can recombine with holes of either spin ) .",
