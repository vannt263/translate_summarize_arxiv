    "over the last @xmath0half a dozen years , deep colour - magitude diagrams ( cmds ) from images taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) revealed that several intermediate - age ( @xmath012 gyr old ) star clusters in the magellanic clouds host extended main sequence turn - off ( msto ) regions @xcite , in some cases accompanied by composite red clumps @xcite .",
    "a popular interpretation of these extended mstos ( hereafter emstos ) is that they are due to stars that formed at different times within the parent cluster , with age spreads of 150500 myr @xcite .",
    "alternative potential causes to explain the emsto phenomenon presented in the recent literature include spreads in rotation velocity among turn - off stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see girardi et al .",
    "2011 ) , a photometric feature of interacting binary stars @xcite or a combination of both @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the nature of the emsto phenomenon among intermediate - age star clusters is that it is not shared by all such clusters ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context , (",
    "* hereafter g11a ) suggested that the key factor in determinining whether or not a cluster features an emsto is its ability to retain material ejected by first - generation stars that feature relatively slow stellar outflows ( the so - called `` polluters '' ) . following the arguments presented in g11a , emstos",
    "can only be hosted by clusters for which the escape velocity was higher than the wind velocity of such polluter stars at the time such stars were present in the cluster",
    ".    currently , the most popular candidates for first - generation `` polluters '' are _",
    "( i ) _ intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath4 , hereafter im - agb ; e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , _ ( ii ) _ rapidly rotating massive stars ( often referred to as `` frms '' ; e.g. @xcite ) and _ ( iii ) _ massive binary stars @xcite .    for what concerns instead the formation scenario",
    ", the currently two favored ones predict that the stars have been formed from or polluted by gas that is a mixture of pristine material and material shed by such `` polluters '' .",
    "in particular , in the `` in situ star formation '' scenario ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , subsequent generations of stars are formed out of gas clouds that were polluted by winds of first generation stars to varying extents , during a period spanning up to a few hundreds of myr , depending on the nature of the `` polluters '' .",
    "conversely , in the alternative `` early - disc accretion '' scenario @xcite , the chemically enriched material , ejected from interacting high - mass binary systems or frms stars , is accreted onto the circumstellar discs of low - mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars that were formed in the _ same generation _ during the first @xmath3 20 myr after the formation of the star cluster .",
    "two recent studies provided support to the predictions of the `` in situ '' scenario .",
    "* hereafter g14 ) studied in detail hst photometry of a sample of 18 massive intermediate - age star clusters in the magellanic clouds that covered a variety of masses , ages , and radii .",
    "g14 found that all the star clusters in their sample host emstos , featuring age spreads that correlate with the clusters escape velocity @xmath5 , both currently and at an age of 10 myr .    furthermore , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c14 ) studied 4 low - mass ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) intermediate - age star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and found that the two clusters that host emstos have @xmath8 15 kms@xmath2  out to ages of @xmath0 100 myr , whereas @xmath9 12 kms@xmath2  at all ages for the two clusters that do _ not _ exhibit emstos .",
    "these results suggest that the `` critical '' escape velocity for a star cluster to able to retain the material ejected by the slow winds of the first generation polluters seems to be in the approximate range of 1215 kms@xmath2 . interestingly ,",
    "these escape velocities are consistent with wind velocities of im - agb stars which are in the range 1218 kms@xmath2  @xcite and with the low end of observed velocities of ejecta of the massive binary star ry scuti ( 1550 kms@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the context of the multiple population scenario , one piece of the puzzle that is still missing is the identification of an age spread ( i.e. , second - generation stars ) in young massive star clusters .",
    "in fact , one of the prediction of the `` in situ '' scenario is that emsto should be observed also in young star clusters if they have the adequate properties in terms of mass and escape velocity .",
    "young star clusters must be massive enough ( i.e. , m @xmath10 m@xmath7 ) in order to have deep enough potentials and high enough escape velocities to retain material lost due to stellar evolution of the first generation stars and to be able to accrete new material from the pristine gas still present in the surroundings .",
    "unfortunately , these strict constraints render young star clusters in which the presence of the emsto phenomenon is expected and verifiable very scarce .",
    "g11a identified the relatively young ( @xmath0 300 myr ) massive star cluster ngc  1856 in the lmc as a promising candidate . following this suggestion , @xcite analyzed archival wide field & planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of this cluster , finding no evidence for age spreads larger than @xmath0 35 myr , which was interpreted by the authors as a suggestion that the emsto feature in intermediate - age clusters can not be due to age spreads .",
    "however , the data analyzed by @xcite seem to have reached only @xmath32 mag beyond the msto , whose shape is vertical for the filters used in their study ( f450w and f555w ) .",
    "this is not deep enough to sample a significant portion of the ms of the cluster , especially its curvature at lower stellar masses , which is important to constrain several important parameters of the cluster such as age , metallicity , distance , and reddening . in principle , this could have prevented the identification of features that might point to the presence of second - generation stars .    with this in mind",
    ", we present an analysis of new hst wfc3 photometry of ngc  1856 . these data allowed us to sample the cluster population down to @xmath38 mag beyond the msto , obtaining deep cmds that permit a thorough examination of the msto morphology and the nature of the cluster .",
    "we compare the observed cmd with monte carlo simulations in order to quantify whether it can be reproduced by one simple stellar population ( ssp ) or whether it is best reproduced by a range of ages .",
    "we also study the evolution of the cluster mass and escape velocity from an age of 10 myr to its current age , to verify whether the cluster has the right properties to form and retain a second generation of stars .",
    "this analysis allows us to reveal new findings on the star formation history of the cluster ngc  1856 in the context of the multiple population scenario .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ s : obs ] presents the observations and data reduction . in section  [ s : cmd ]",
    "we present the observed cmd , we describe the technique applied to correct the cmd due to the presence of differential reddening effects and we derive the best - fit isochrones . in section  [ s : mcsim ]",
    "we compare the observed cmd with monte carlo simulations , both using one ssp and a combination of two ssps with different ages .",
    "we derive pseudo - age distributions for the observed and simulated cmds and compare them . in section  [",
    "s : excess ] we investigate the presence of ongoing star formation in the cluster , looking for pms stars of the second generation . in section  [",
    "s : rotation ] we test the prediction of the stellar rotation scenario , while section  [ s : dynamics ] presents the physical and dynamical properties of the cluster , deriving the evolution of the cluster escape velocity as a function of age . finally , in section  [ s : conclusion ] , we present and discuss our main results .",
    ", based on the @xcite model fit derived as described in section  [ s : kingmodel ] ; open squares and dashed line represent data in the range between @xmath11 and 2 @xmath12 and the open triangles and dotted lines represent data outside 2 @xmath12 . ]",
    "ngc  1856 was observed with hst on 2013 november 12 using the uvis channel of the wfc3 as part of the hst program 13011 ( pi : t. h.  puzia ) .",
    "the cluster was centered on one of the two ccd chips of the wfc3 uvis camera , so that the observations cover enough radial extent to study variations within cluster radius and to avoid the loss of the central region of the cluster due to the ccd chip gap .",
    "the cluster was observed in four filters , namely f438w , f555w , f658n , and f814w .",
    "two long exposures were taken in each of the four filters : their exposure times were 430 s ( f438w ) , 350 s ( f555w ) , 450 s ( f814w ) and 940 s ( f658n ) .",
    "in addition , we took three short exposures in the f438w , f656n and f814w filters ( 185 s , 735 s and 51 s , respectively ) , to avoid saturation of the brightest rgb and agb stars .",
    "the two long exposures in each filter were spatially offset from each other by 2401 in a direction + 8576 with respect to the positive x - axis of the detector , in order to move across the gap between the two ccd chips , as well to simplify the identification and removal of hot pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "in addition to the wfc3/uvis observations , we used the wide field camera ( wfc ) of acs in parallel to obtain images @xmath13 from the cluster center .",
    "these acs images have been taken with the f435w , f656n and f814w filters and provide valuable information of the stellar content and star formation history in the underlying lmc field , permitting us to establish in detail the field star contamination fraction in each region of the cmds .    to reduce the images we followed the method described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we started from the _ flt _ files provided by the hst pipeline , which constitute the bias - corrected , dark - subtracted and flat - fielded images .",
    "after correcting the _ flt _ files for charge transfer inefficiency using the dedicated cte correction software , we generated distortion - free images using multidrizzle @xcite and we calculated the transformation between the individually drizzled images in each filter , linking them to a reference frame ( i.e. , the first exposure ) . through these transformations",
    "we obtain an alignment of the individual images to better than 0.02 pixels . after flagging and rejecting bad pixels and cosmic rays from the input images",
    ", we created a final image for each filter , combining the input undistorted and aligned frames .",
    "the final stacked images were generated at the native resolution of the wfc3/uvis and acs / wfc ( i.e. , 0040 pixel@xmath2 and 0049 pixel@xmath2 , respectively ) ."
