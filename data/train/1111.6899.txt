    "the area of extreme value theory focuses on the study and development of stochastic models that can be used for inference on applied problems related to the frequency of very big ( or very small ) values in random experiments .",
    "one such widely used model is the generalised pareto ( gp ) distribution defined by its distribution function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a vector of parameters in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "consider a random variable @xmath4 arising from an absolutely continuous distribution function @xmath5 and let also @xmath6 be the upper end point of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite shows that if there exists a scaling function @xmath7 , @xmath8 , such that the scaled excess random variable @xmath9 converges in distribution to a non - degenerate limit as @xmath10 , then this is necessarily of the same type as the gp distribution , i.e. , @xmath11 without loss of generality , the scaling function @xmath12 can be defined by the reciprocal hazard function of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite shows that a necessary and sufficient condition for twice differentiable convergence is @xmath14 , meaning that not only limit  ( [ eq : gpdlimit ] ) holds but the corresponding densities and derivatives of densities converge .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is most commonly referred to as the shape parameter or the tail index of the distribution and we adopt the latter since we use the word shape for a different characteristic in the paper .",
    "the sign of the tail index @xmath15 indicates the decay of the tail of @xmath5 : @xmath16 means that @xmath5 has a heavy - tailed distribution , @xmath17 corresponds to exponential decay and @xmath18 means that @xmath5 has finite upper end point , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed measurements @xmath20 arising from the random variable @xmath4 .",
    "standard practice in applications where we want to estimate extreme quantiles of the underlying distribution is to follow the approach of @xcite and assume that the limit relationship  ( [ eq : gpdlimit ] ) holds exactly for some threshold @xmath21 ; i.e. , @xmath22 has distribution function @xmath23 where the function @xmath24 is absorbed in the distribution function @xmath25 as a threshold dependent scale parameter @xmath26 .",
    "extreme events are defined by the threshold exceedances @xmath27 and subsequently , the gp distribution is fitted to the random sample of excesses @xmath28 using maximum likelihood techniques . the fitted model is then extrapolated to levels above which no data are observed .",
    "two central assumptions are imposed when using this procedure in practice .",
    "one is that the asymptotic argument of equation  ( [ eq : gpdlimit ] ) is valid for the distribution function of the data under study and second is that an appropriate threshold @xmath29 can be found such that the gp model provides a good approximation to exceedances of @xmath29 . for a number of reasons such as the cost and time of collecting data , few observations of a measurement process",
    "might be recorded in applications .",
    "since @xmath30 and @xmath31 is small , @xmath32 and so limit  ( [ eq : gpdlimit ] ) is likely to be a poor approximation to the distribution of exceedances of @xmath29 in such cases .",
    "figure  [ fig : pharma_data ] shows such an example of residual bilirubin data collected from a clinical study of 606 patients who were randomized to 4 doses of a drug , the highest dose of which is considered to have potential for liver toxicity .",
    "data were available prior to treatment ( baseline visit ) and after 6 weeks of treatment ( postbaseline ) .",
    "the residual bilirubin observations are the residuals of linear median regression models of postbaseline on the baseline in each dose , see also @xcite for a similar analysis .",
    "the 4 different doses are coded here with increasing dose as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the published literature reports jaundice , hepatitis and similar symptoms in approximately 1 out of 500 patients taking the dose @xmath36 of this drug , see @xcite . according to @xcite joint occurrence of extremes of the total bilirubin and aminotransferase laboratory variables",
    "are indicative of drug induced liver toxicity . therefore , proper statistical modelling of their extremes is vital for assessing the liver toxicity of a new drug .",
    "however , the limited amount of information in each dose illustrates the problems of relying on the gp distribution .",
    "we will return to the analysis of these data in   [ sec : pharma ] .",
    "the issue of specifying an appropriate threshold for fitting the gp distribution constitutes the major problem of the @xcite approach .",
    "typically , a threshold @xmath29 is chosen as the lowest possible value above which the estimates of the tail index @xmath15 and the modified scale @xmath37 stabilise ( see * ? ? ?",
    "departures from the gp distribution again imply that such a threshold might not be observable .",
    "moreover , the higher the threshold the larger the sampling variability of the estimates of the modified scale and tail index parameters which leads to estimates being unstable over different thresholds .",
    "a variety of methods have been developed in the literature to address the problem of departures from the gp model assumption .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite among others , use second order refined models to select the threshold and proceed with the estimation of tail characteristics by using the gp distribution .",
    "@xcite also use a second order approach for the modelling of the tail probability as well as for the extrapolation .",
    "an even more unsettling feature arises in cases where two or more seemingly plausible thresholds yield significantly different estimates of extreme quantities of interest . in such circumstances ,",
    "the threshold selection is liable to be the subjective choice of the practitioner .",
    "@xcite propose unsupervised tail estimation with the use of a dynamic mixture model aimed for the entire distribution of the data .",
    "@xcite take into account the threshold uncertainty by allowing the threshold to be estimated as a statistical parameter in a mixture model .",
    "@xcite also use a mixture model where the non - extreme part of the data is estimated non - parametrically .",
    "@xcite exploit penultimate theory to model threshold uncertainty and provide a likelihood ratio testing procedure for the threshold selection .",
    "all of the aforementioned approaches are either based on second order asymptotic arguments adding a little extra flexibility to the fit of the gp distribution or they model the entire distribution , i.e. , model the body as well as the tail .",
    "furthermore , some of these approaches are confined to the heavy - tailed case @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "our goal in this article is to construct parametric models for exceedances over thresholds that are more flexible than the gp distribution and add further insight on the threshold selection problem . for this purpose , in   [ sec : hazard ] we construct a new class of probability models with distribution function @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a shape parameter , that generalises the gp distribution in the sense that there exists a @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "this parameter @xmath42 offers additional structure by inducing skewness to the gp distribution while retaining @xmath43 as the tail index .",
    "thus , a class of departures from the gp assumption of limit  ( [ eq : gpdlimit ] ) are captured by this shape parameter @xmath42 .",
    "we will show that the inclusion of @xmath42 improves the stability of the estimates of the tail index and modified scale parameter and allows a lower threshold to be selected .",
    "consequently , extrapolations based on different thresholds are more stable than those obtained from the gp distribution , a feature which makes the choice of threshold less important .    in   [ sec :",
    "theory ] we present three extensions of the gp distribution and derive a characterisation of a class of models which includes these examples .",
    "the new models are given along with the description of the methodology implemented for the analysis of threshold exceedances .",
    "a statistical test aiding threshold selection is also illustrated .",
    "the effect of the new probability models on the statistical analysis of extremes is assessed with a simulation study in   [ sec : simulation ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : apps ] we illustrate the benefits of the new models through the analysis of extreme flow data of the river nidd , a dataset with known difficulties in threshold selection , and the clinical trial data in figure  [ fig : pharma_data ] .",

    "this feature demonstrates the usefulness of this plot as an additional diagnostic for the gp modelling framework .",
    "the 95% pointwise confidence intervals are largest for small and large threshold values .",
    "this feature is explained by the greater dependence of parameters @xmath15 and @xmath42 at low threshold values ( revealed by the profile likelihood plots of @xmath15 and @xmath42 that are not shown here ) and the few data points at high threshold values .",

    ".    moreover , the fact that @xmath244 stabilise to values around @xmath245 for the threshold values above 74 suggests that any threshold in this region is reasonable for the gp distribution . however , small deviations of @xmath246 from the value 1 in this threshold region seem to have an impact on the stability of the gp estimates and the lowest threshold where @xmath224 is very close to 1 is 75.3m@xmath240s@xmath241 .",
    "this finding is also consistent with that of the @xcite approach where they choose the value of 75m@xmath247s@xmath241 .",
    "we thus select and @xmath248m@xmath240s@xmath241 for the gp distribution .",

    "we now return to the analysis of the residual bilirubin data shown in figure  [ fig : pharma_data ] .  as already mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] , the identification of liver toxic drugs is a multivariate extreme value problem in which the joint occurrence of extremes of residual bilirubin and other laboratory variables must be well modelled .",
    "however , as any multivariate extreme value analysis necessitates , the marginal extremes of these variables have to be modelled first .",
    "@xcite analysed the extremes of all laboratory variables taken from the same dataset with the gp modelling approach of @xcite , taking the threshold as the 70% quantile of the data .",
    "they found dose response relationships for all liver related laboratory variables other than residual bilirubin , justified by gp models with scale or tail index parameters linear in dose .",

    "[ sec : pit ] allows the inclusion of more data points which might reveal evidence of relationship between residual bilirubin and dose , missed by @xcite . to assess the relationship of residual bilirubin with dose we use generalised likelihood ratio tests between models that have dose dependent parameters and models with the same parameters across doses",
    "the practice of pooling parameters and more specifically of the tail index in the extreme value modelling framework can be found in various applications including @xcite and @xcite to name but a few .",
    "let @xmath254 be the excesses of the residual bilirubin variable over the threshold @xmath29 at dose @xmath255 .",
    "we initially fit the egp1 model to the excesses over thresholds ranging from -0.65 ( @xmath256 ) to 0.15 ( @xmath257 ) by allowing separate shape , scale and tail index parameters for each dose , i.e. , @xmath258 @xmath259 , for dose @xmath260 .",
    "the numbers in brackets are the corresponding sample quantiles of the combined data .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ fig : kappaxihat_pharma ] shows the maximum likelihood estimates @xmath261 over the threshold values .",
    "a feature revealed from this graph is that the estimated shape parameters appear to be similar across the doses for thresholds greater than @xmath262 .",
    "this is also supported by the generalised likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis @xmath263 vs @xmath264 , where @xmath265 and @xmath266 is the complement of the set @xmath267 .",
    "specifically , the generalised likelihood ratio test failed to reject the null hypothesis at all thresholds other than the threshold values below -0.51 .",
    "thus , we proceed to the analysis of the bilirubin data with the estimated common shape parameter shown with the dark grey line in the left plot of figure  [ fig : kappaxihat_pharma ] .",
    "the right plot of figure  [ fig : kappaxihat_pharma ] shows the maximum likelihood estimates @xmath268 under the assumption of common shape across doses . in this case , the generalised likelihood ratio test failed to reject the null hypothesis of common tail index over dose at all thresholds .",
    "we found that the simplest model selected by generalised likelihood ratio tests is with common shape , scale and tail index parameters for all doses .",
    "we also found similar results regardless of the order according to which the pooling of parameters was conducted .",
    "this suggests that there is no evidence of relationship between the residual bilirubin and dose for all thresholds greater than -0.51 , at the significance level of 5% .",
    "however , for thresholds below @xmath262 there is evidence of a relationship with dose as indicated by the significant increase in the shape parameter estimate for dose @xmath36 .",
    "this change indicates larger quantiles for dose @xmath36 than for the other doses .",
    "figure  [ fig : qq ] shows the quantile - quantile plots for the egp1 and gp models with common shape , scale and tail index parameters among doses , fitted to the threshold exceedances above 0.10 ( @xmath269 ) and -0.13 ( @xmath270 ) , respectively .",
    "the parameter estimates obtained from the egp1 and gp fits are @xmath271 and @xmath272 respectively .",
    "their corresponding standard errors are @xmath273 and @xmath274 . for the gp model we used @xcite choice of the 70% quantile which is consistent with the stability of the parameter estimates .",
    "for both models , the fit is good as the majority of the observed data points lie within the 95% pointwise tolerance intervals .",
    "the best fitting egp1 model has @xmath224 significantly different from @xmath275 , and hence provides evidence of a departure from the gp distribution at the selected threshold .",
    "however , above the respective thresholds used to fit the two models there is no apparent difference in the quality of the fits .",
    "the finding of no evidence of a dose effect in the egp models is identical to findings of the previous gp analysis . despite this failure to identify a dose effect for thresholds above @xmath262",
    ", we believe our analysis offers considerable benefits .",
    "specifically , due to being able to substantially lower the threshold used relative to the gp analysis , larger sample sizes are used and thus the power of a test for dose effects in the residual bilirubin data is increased .      i. papastathopoulos s work was carried under funding from astrazeneca .",
    "we would particularly like to thank harry southworth of astrazeneca for helpful discussions , suggestions and constructive comments on the analysis of the bilirubin data of   [ sec : pharma ] and ivar struijker boudier for carrying out and validating some of the numerical calculations of   [ sec : simulation ] .",
