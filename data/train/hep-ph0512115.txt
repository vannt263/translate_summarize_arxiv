    "the neutrino emission process plays an important role in the late stages of the stellar evolution .",
    "it is known that the radiation of neutrino could be dominated over the ordinary electromagnetic radiation in case of highly dense and hot stellar structures , such as , white dwarves or neutron stars . unlike the other mechanisms the neutrinos are produced directly from their point of origin and do not require the transport of energy to the surface of the stellar object before getting radiated . as a consequence",
    "the energy outflow is given directly by the rate at which the neutrinos are produced .",
    "photo - neutrino process @xmath5 , pair - annihilation process @xmath6 and plasma neutrino process @xmath7 are the sole mechanisms that carry away the energy from star during its evolution period , although there are few more processes which might play more important role under some special environments . chiu and his collaborators",
    "@xcite calculated some important neutrino emission processes and pointed out their important role in astrophysics . in 1972",
    "dicus @xcite reconsidered a few such processes in the framework of electro - weak interaction theory and calculated the energy - loss rate at the various stages of the stellar evolution . according to the standard model the neutrino has the minimal properties such as zero mass , zero charge etc .",
    "introduction of neutrino mass compatible with the experimental data is a bare minimum extension of the standard model . in the frame work of standard model with this little extension",
    "some calculations @xcite related to the neutrino process have already been carried out .",
    "itoh et al .",
    "@xcite considered some neutrino emission processes to calculate them numerically .",
    "+ pontecorvo @xcite gave an idea that the neutrino may be emitted by the interaction of electron with the nucleus , called bremsstrahlung process .",
    "gandelman and pinaev @xcite carried out the detailed calculations for this process in the non - relativistic electron gas .",
    "after that festa and ruderman @xcite extended this calculations for relativistic limit with considering the screening effect that becomes important in the high density .",
    "dicus et al .",
    "@xcite considered the process according to the standard model and compare the result with different screening effect .",
    "saha @xcite calculated the bremsstrahlung process according to photon - neutrino weak coupling theory which is very much satisfactory in explaining the neutrino - synchrotron process @xcite . in this article",
    "we have considered the bremsstrahlung process in presence of strong magnetic field and this is the first attempt to do so .",
    "it has been shown by festa and ruderman @xcite and then by dicus et al .",
    "@xcite that the bremsstrahlung process has maximum effect in the relativistic degenerate region ; thus in the stellar object such as newly born born neutron star the process is supposed to be very much effective .",
    "here we are to verify whether the presence of strong magnetic field , which may be generated in the rotating neutron stars , will have any effect on the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "we have calculated the scattering cross section and then obtained the energy - loss rate for the bremsstrahlung both in presence and absence of strong magnetic field .",
    "we are going to study the influence of high magnetic field on the bremsstrahlung process and the region where its presence may take a crucial role in the neutrino emission .",
    "the ordinary neutrino bremsstrahlung process is very much significant for the neutrino energy generation process in the relativistic highly degenerate region ; therefore a comparative study is required for this process in presence and also in absence of strong magnetic field .",
    "in the bremsstrahlung process the electron interacts with the nucleus having the coulomb potential @xmath8 i.e. a single charge with an exponential screening cloud ( yukawa like charge distribution ) , where @xmath9 is the debye screening length given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the fermi momentum and energy respectively .",
    "we consider the potential , given by ( 2.1 ) , because the screening effect is important in the high density region .",
    "there will be four different feynman diagrams shown in the figure-1 ( z - exchange diagram ) and figure-2 ( w - exchange diagram ) . in our calculations",
    "the presence of magnetic field plays a crucial role , so it is to be handled with care . without any loss of generality we can take the direction of magnetic field along @xmath13-axis . in presence of magnetic field",
    "the energy momentum relation of the electron becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 g stands for critical magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath16 represents the landau level for the electron in the magnetic field .",
    "[ the value of @xmath17 is taken as @xmath18 as per the spin of the electron is directed towards or opposite to the direction of magnetic field ( along z - axis ) respectively . ]",
    "+ the component of electron momentum along the direction of magnetic field remains unaffected .",
    "it is clear that the effect of magnetic field on the electron quantizes its energy to the direction perpendicular to @xmath19 and thus transverse components would get replaced by @xmath20 , whereas the longitudinal component @xmath21 would be directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the bremsstrahlung process are same for both in presence and absence of magnetic field ; only we have to keep in our mind that four momenta of the electronic lines , present in the diagrams , should be modified .",
    "first we shall calculate the ordinary bremsstrahlung process i.e. the process in absence of magnetic field .",
    "the matrix element can be constructed as @xmath22 where , @xmath23u(p)\\eqno{(2.5)}\\ ] ] @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 the energy momentum conservation leads to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is purely space like as in the case of photo - coulomb neutrino process @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath29 present in the equation ( 2.7 ) arises due to the screening effect and can be expressed as @xmath30 using some simplifications we can write the term @xmath31 as follows : @xmath32 \\overline{u}(p')\\gamma^{0}(c_{v}-c_{a}\\gamma_{5})u(p)\\eqno{(2.9)}\\ ] ] we can put this expression to the equation ( 2.4 ) to get the expression for the scattering matrix .",
    "now the squared sum of the scattering matrix over the final spins is to be integrated over the final momenta .",
    "the squared sum of the expression @xmath33 $ ] gives @xmath34 note that in the equation ( 2.10 ) no neutrino momentum is present , so this part will not be taken into account during the integration over the final momenta of neutrinos .",
    "let us now evaluate the squared spin sum of the expression @xmath35 and then integrating over final momenta of the neutrinos we can obtain [ see appendix - a ] @xmath36 @xmath37^{2}\\eqno{(2.11)}\\ ] ] up to this step the calculations for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process would be same in both situations i.e. in presence as well as absence of magnetic field .",
    "it is assumed that in presence of magnetic field quantized transverse components of the momentum do not participate directly during the interaction between nucleus and electron .",
    "only the z - component of the electron momentum takes part in this process .",
    "thus in this case we can obtain an expression almost similar to the equation ( 2.11 ) with replacing @xmath38 and @xmath39 by @xmath40 and @xmath21 respectively . now",
    "to integrate the squared sum of the matrix element over all final momenta we shall utilize the result obtained in the equation ( 2.10 ) and ( 2.11 ) , but we have to take care when the magnetic field is present . in this case the phase space factor @xmath41 takes the form [ see appendix - b ] @xmath42 whereas in the ordinary bremsstrahlung process the integration over the final momentum of electron is done in the usual manner . in the center of mass frame and assuming the electron momentum is much high relative to its rest mass we can carry out the calculations . in this extreme relativistic limit",
    "we can evaluate the integral over the final momentum of electron and obtain the following expression .",
    "@xmath43 this expression is obtained for the ordinary bremsstrahlung process when there will be no magnetic field . in presence of magnetic field this expression",
    "becomes @xmath44 note that the term @xmath45 arises due to the weak screening effect .",
    "it is given by @xmath46 the expression for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the electron type of neutrino emission will differ from those in case of muon and tau neutrino emission , since w - boson exchange diagrams are present only when the electron neutrino anti - neutrino pair is emitted . inserting the above terms into the expression of the scattering cross section for both of those cases and returning to the c.g.s .",
    "unit we can finally obtain @xmath49 in absence of magnetic field , whereas @xmath50 in presence of magnetic field .",
    "+ it is worth noting that all three type of neutrinos are taken into account in our calculations .",
    "our result ( equation 2.16 ) shows that the scattering cross section for the bremsstrahlung process in presence of magnetic field will not depend on the energy of the incoming electron , but on the intensity of the magnetic field present in the surroundings .",
    "in the extreme relativistic case the energy loss rate in erg per nucleus per second for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is calculated by the formula @xmath51}c\\sigma e e^{\\frac{e - e_{f}}{\\kappa t}}\\eqno{(3.1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 stands for fermi energy of the electron .",
    "we are considering the case in which the electrons are highly degenerate .",
    "it is well known that in the degenerate region the energy of the electron remains below the fermi energy level . to obtain the energy - loss rate in erg per gram per second @xmath52",
    "is divided by @xmath53 and it is obtained as @xmath54 where , @xmath55 + the @xmath56 represents the ratio of the fermi temperature to the maximum temperature of the degenerate electron gas .",
    "the degeneracy will be attained only when the following condition will be satisfied @xcite . @xmath57",
    "it can be obtained @xmath58 , considering the fact that temperature and density of the electron gas present in the core of a newly born neutron star would be approximately @xmath59 k and @xmath60 @xmath4 respectively",
    ". the term @xmath45 arises due to the weak screening , related to @xmath56 by @xmath61 .",
    "thus we can calculate the term @xmath45 , present in the equation ( 3.2 ) .",
    "finally the expression for the energy - loss rate becomes @xmath62 in the same manner we can obtain the energy loss rate in presence of magnetic field . in that case",
    "the the phase space factor will be replaced according to the rule defined in ( b6 ) . in the same manner energy - loss rate",
    "can be calculated as @xmath63 where , @xmath64 + we have computed ( table-1 ) the logarithmic value of the energy loss rate in the temperature range @xmath65 k and the magnetic field @xmath66 g at a fixed density @xmath67 @xmath4 .",
    "the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is an important energy generation mechanism during the stellar evolution and very much effective in the highly degenerate region , for examples , in the cores of low mass red giants , white dwarves etc .",
    "in addition to this degenerate nature if the electron gas is highly relativistic the energy - loss rate through the bremsstrahlung process would be significantly high .",
    "it has already been calculated that the neutrino luminosity in the crust of neutron star is high enough @xcite , but it is yet to be verified what would be the effect of neutrino emission by the bremsstrahlung process in the core region , particularly when the core is strongly magnetized .",
    "the discovery of radio pulsars showed that the collapse of normal stars results not only in supernova explosions , but may also generate strong magnetic field . in some stellar objects like neutron stars and magnetars",
    "the magnetic field may reach to @xmath68 g and influences the neutrino emission process .",
    "it is known that the neutron star is born as a result of type ii supernova explosion . in the newly born neutron star",
    "the core temperature becomes @xmath59 k which drops down to @xmath69 k within few seconds of its birth and then slowly cools down until the temperature reaches to @xmath70 k , after which the electromagnetic emission dominates over the neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the electron gas , still left in the stellar core , is highly degenerate and relativistic .",
    "+ we are going to verify the role of the magnetic field on the neutrino bremsstrahlung process . in the neutrino synchrotron radiation",
    "@xcite neutrino anti - neutrino pair emission takes place since the electron changes its landau levels , but in the bremsstrahlung the landau levels are assumed to be unchanged throughout the process .",
    "the process occurs through the change of magnitude of the component of electron linear momentum directed along the magnetic field .",
    "it is found from table-1 that in the temperature range @xmath71 k @xmath72 k and at the density @xmath60 @xmath4 the energy loss rate for the ordinary bremsstrahlung process is greater than that in presence of strong magnetic field ( @xmath2 g ) .",
    "we can interpret that in the early stage of neutron star cooling , when the temperature remains above @xmath71 k , the effect of the bremsstrahlung process get lowered due to the presence of magnetic field , although the energy loss rate is still very high .",
    "if the strength of the magnetic field goes below the critical value , the process would become free from the influence of magnetic field , and a greater amount of neutrino energy is produced .",
    "it is evident from our work that though , in general , the magnetic field makes the bremsstrahlung process a bit less effective , but there exists a particular region ( @xmath73 k @xmath74 k , @xmath75 g and @xmath76 @xmath4 ) during neutron star cooling , where the bremsstrahlung process contributes a greater amount of neutrino energy loss by the influence of magnetic field compared to the situation when there would be no magnetic field at all .",
    "therefore , it can be predicted that if the temperature falls below @xmath71 k , the process would give maximum effect due to the presence of super strong magnetic field having intensity @xmath68 g. our study reveals that the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is an important energy generation mechanism in the late stages of the stellar evolution , even in presence of magnetic field .",
