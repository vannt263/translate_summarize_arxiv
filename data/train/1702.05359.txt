    "quantum cascade systems ( qcss ) describe those physical situations where a first party ( the _ controller _ ) can influence the dynamic of a second party ( the _ idler _ ) without being affected by the latter .",
    "the asymmetric character of these couplings originates from the presence of an environmental medium ( e.g. an optical isolator  @xcite or a bosonic chiral channel ) which acts as mediator of the interactions and which allows for unidirectional propagation of pulses from a controller to its associated idler .",
    "first interests in these models grew in the 80 s because of the necessity of a formalism able to take into account the reaction of a quantum system ( say an atom or a electromagnetic cavity ) to the light emitted by another one @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been a revival of interest towards qcss , due to the possibility of creating entangled states and other tasks for quantum computation @xcite , chiral optical networks @xcite , and in the managing of heat transmission @xcite ; also several experimental implementations have been proposed , exploiting , for instance , nanophotonic waveguides @xcite and spin - orbit coupling @xcite .     of quantum subsystems",

    "instead we shall consider more complex configurations where several subsystems interact , unidirectionally via a network of mutually intercepting channels as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . in this scenario",
    "the qcs couplings while being intrinsically dissipative in nature , can be affected by interference effects which originate from the propagation of the controlling pulses along the network of connections ( for instance in the case of figure , the signals from the subsystem @xmath0 split and recombine before reaching subsystem @xmath7 ) .",
    "also , depending on the topology of the scheme , controlling signals from different parties ( say the subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath8 of the figure ) can merge before reaching a given idler ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the study of such architectures is intriguing as it widens the possibility of engineering system - bath coupling in quantum optical systems , which in turn may help in dissipatively preparing quantum many - body states of matter  @xcite with important consequences in the analysis of non - equilibrium condensed matter physics problems  @xcite and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "aim of the present work is to derive a mathematical framework that incorporate these phenomena in a consistent way .",

    "the paper then ends with sec.[sec : con ] where we draw conclusions and give an outlook for future works , and with the appendix section where we present some technical derivations .",
    "in the collisional model approach @xcite to open quantum systems dynamics the environment is represented as a large many - body quantum system whose constituents ( quantum information carriers or carriers in the following ) interact with the system of interest via an ordered sequence of impulsive unitary transformations ( collisional events ) .",
    "this yields a , time - discrete , stroboscopic evolution which can then be turned into a continuous time dynamics by properly sending to infinite the number of collisions and to zero the time interval among them while keeping constant their product . by means of collisional models",

    "the unitaries @xmath26 s trigger the dissipative evolution of @xmath14 which is responsible for the qcs dynamics .",

    "in this work we developed a general theoretical framework for modeling complex networks of quantum systems organized in a cascade fashion , _ i.e. _  such that the coupling between the various subsystems is mediated by unidirectional environmental channels . differently from previous approaches , our framework allows also to consider interactions and interference effects between environmental channels , inducing a rich and complex effective dynamics on the nodes of the network .",
    "the theoretical derivation is based on a collisional model that allows to derive a many - body master equation which preserves the positivity of the density matrix and correctly incorporates the causal structure of the network . moreover , expressing the master equation in lindblad form , we obtain an effective hamiltonian coupling between the systems which is externally tunable by properly modifying the parameters of the network .",
    "we focused on two particular examples : a cascade system in a mach - zehnder - like configuration showing dissipative interference effects , and a tripartite cascade network where the topology of the interactions is controllable by means of a simple phase shifter .",
    "more generally , the possibility of engineering hamiltonian and dissipative interactions exploiting interference effects in cascade systems is very intriguing and worth to be further investigated in future works .",
