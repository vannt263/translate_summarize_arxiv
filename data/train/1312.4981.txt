    "the presence of fallback associated with supernova ( sn ) explosions was recognized since early sn studies ( colgate 1971 ; chevalier 1989 ) .",
    "it occurs when part of the ejecta fails to achieve terminal escape velocity and accretes onto the central compact object . if some of this material has angular momentum larger than the keplerian value at the last stable orbit ( or at the surface of the compact object , if a neutron star ) , then the formation of a disk is expected .",
    "fallback disks around newly born compact objects have been invoked to explain a large variety of phenomena . hyperaccreting disks formed from the fallback of massive , rapidly rotating stars , whose iron cores collapse into black holes ,",
    "are believed to provide the energy source that powers the class of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( woosley 1993 , macfadyen % woosley 1999 ) .",
    "macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) studied the formation and evolution of such a disk numerically , following the explosion of a 35 @xmath7 main sequence star with angular momentum in the @xmath8 @xmath9 s@xmath10 range .",
    "the detailed angular momentum structure of the fallback material is believed to play a role in the early x - ray emission following the prompt grb ( e.g. kumar et al .",
    "2008 ; cannizzo & gehrels 2009 ; perna & macfadyen 2010 ; geng et al .",
    "2013 ) .                    in the case of neutron stars ( nss )",
    ", there is a much larger variety of phenomena that has been potentially ascribed to the presence of a fallback disk .",
    "michel & dessler ( 1981 ) and michel ( 1988 ) originally emphasized that the presence of such disks can play a role in the evolution of young nss .",
    "lin , woosley & bodenheimer ( 1991 ) noticed how such disks can provide a clue regarding the formation of planets around young neutron stars , while chatterjee , hernquist & narayan ( 2000 ) , and alpar ( 2001 ) showed how fallback disks around nss of ages @xmath11 yr can produce , by accretion onto the ns surface , x - ray luminosities as high as @xmath12 erg / s .",
    "these are sufficient to explain the x - ray luminosities of the anomalous x - ray pulsars , a class of neutron stars whose x - ray luminosity is 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes higher than their spin down energy , at odds with the more traditional radio pulsars , whose x - ray emission is powered by their rotational energy loss .",
    "fallback disks have also been invoked ( xu et al .",
    "2003 ; shi & xu 2003 ) to explain the observational properties of the central compact objects ( pavlov et al .",
    "2004 ) in supernova remnants .",
    "the effects of fallback disks on the spin evolution of neutron stars have been discussed by a number of authors .",
    "marsden , lingenfelter & rothschild ( 2001 ) pointed out how the interaction of a putative fallback disk with the magnetosphere of a ns can significantly modify its spin down rate , and as such help cure the discrepancy between the characteristic and the actual age that has been observed in some pulsars .",
    "menou et al .",
    "( 2001a ; see also chen & li 2006 ; yan et al .",
    "2012 ) showed how the extra torque provided by this putative fallback disk can also result in braking indices which depart from the value of 3 expected for spin down by pure dipole radiation .",
    "blackman & perna ( 2004 ) further noticed that the presence of such a disk can play an important role for producing the jets that are observed in some of these pulsars , such as crab and vela .",
    "qiao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) proposed a fallback disk model for periodic timing variations of pulsars .",
    "cordes & shannon ( 2008 ) were able to explain the properties of the recently discovered transient pulsars by means of asteroids formed from a fallback disk and occasionally migrating into the pulsar light cylinder .",
    "the mass ejected by fallback in a supernova explosion has been invoked as a production site for the r - process ( fryer at al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as a potential source of power to sn light curves ( piro & ott 2011 ; dexter & kasen 2013 ) .    from an observational point of view",
    ", fallback disks around nss of @xmath13 yr are expected to be especially bright in infrared radiation ( perna , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) , and there have been many searches aimed at detecting such emission ( see e.g. mignani et al .",
    "2007 for a review ) , resulting in some strong hints of possible detection ( wang , chakrabarty & kaplan 2006 ) .",
    "all the various models and scenarios discussed above , proposed to explain a large variety of astrophysical phenomena , especially in the context of the ns compact object remnants , depend crucially on the specific properties of the fallback disks . in particular",
    "they depend on the specific angular momentum content , which eventually determines the post - fallback circularization radius .",
    "once fallback has ended , this initial radius , coupled with the local viscous timescale , will determine the initial accretion rate .",
    "after their formation , the evolution of fallback disks can be modeled following the results of semi - analytical and numerical studies ( e.g cannizzo , lee & goodman 1990 ; cannizzo & gehrels 2009 ; shen & matzner 2013 ) : an early phase of constant accretion rate , lasting on the order of the viscous time , followed by a powerlaw decay .",
    "once the initial accretion rate @xmath14 is known , then the subsequent evolution is determined in a self - similar fashion .",
    "crucial , therefore , are the _ initial conditions _ , i.e. the mass and location of the matter that falls back and hence determines @xmath15 .",
    "these can only be determined accurately by means of numerical simulations of the collapse of massive rotating stars , and a distribution of angular momenta .",
    "numerical simulations of pre - sn profiles in stars with a range of masses and metallicities have been performed by a number of authors ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 ; fryer & heger 2000 ; macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ; heger , woosley & fryer 2003 ; woosley & heger 2006 ; yoon , langer & norman 2006 ; zhang , woosley & heger 2008 ; woosley & heger 2012 ) .",
    "the aims of these works ranged from an investigation of the properties of grb progenitors , to a determination of the rotational properties of the compact object remnants , to the yields of heavy elements produced by nucleosynthesis . among the studies specifically devoted to fallback disk formation ,",
    "the focus has been on the compact , hyperaccreting disks believed to power grbs .                    in this paper",
    "we take a new look at the problem of massive star collapse , by concentrating our numerical study on the properties of the fallback material that does not hyperaccrete rapidly onto the newly born compact object , but that is instead able to form a long - lasting accretion disk .",
    "we take advantage of the recent inclusion of stellar rotation in the public mesa code for stellar evolution ( paxton et al .",
    "2013 ) , which allows us to run a large grid of models .",
    "our study is aimed at determining the range of initial conditions ( mass , circularization radius ) of the fallback material as a function of mass and angular momentum of the progenitor star , both for the bh and the ns remnant cases .",
    "for the special case of the ns remnants ( not treated so far in the numerical literature ) , we aim at assessing whether the properties of these fallback disks around newly born nss are consistent with those needed to explain a wide range of ns phenomena as described above .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 we describe the grid of main sequence star models that we use ( 60 models , organized in a grid of 3 metallicities , 4 masses , and 5 initial angular velocities ) , and how they are evolved with mesa .",
    "given the importance of magnetic torques in the transfer of angular momentum between various layers , we further explore , for a subset of cases , the dependence of the pre - sn angular momentum on the presence ( or not ) of such magnetic torques .",
    "sec .  3 describes how the stars are exploded , and the resulting fallback mass as a function of explosion energy and initial star configuration .",
    "4 takes the results from sec .  2 and 3 in order to evaluate the properties of the stars for which fallback disks are expected , and , when so , to compute their initial properties and estimate their time evolution .",
    "we find that extended , long - lived disks around isolated nss require very fine - tuned initial conditions , and hence they are not expected to be a common outcome of sn explosions",
    ". extended , long - lived disks could instead be found around bhs of @xmath16 , with conditions possibly suited to planet formation .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .  5 .",
    "the fate of fallback matter after the sn explosion is primarily determined by two factors : the angular momentum distribution of the pre - sn star , and the explosion energy during the sn .",
    "the former determines whether there is _ any _ matter with specific angular momentum larger than the local keplerian value , while the latter determines whether that high-@xmath17 matter remains bound and hence can circularize around the newly born compact object .",
    "we describe in this section the computation of the pre - sn models , while in the following section we describe how the stars are exploded .",
    "we compute the pre - supernova angular momentum profiles by evolving star models with the state - of - the - art open source code mesa ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "this code includes the physics of rotation , the implementation of which has been extensively discussed in paxton et al .",
    "we refer to this latter work for the details of the angular momentum transport mechanisms due to rotation and magnetic torques adopted in this paper .    a number of studies ( maeder 1987 ; yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ; yoon et al . 2006",
    "; paxton et al .",
    "2013 ) have shown that , at a certain threshold ( surface ) rotation rate @xmath18 , the evolution on the h - r diagram bifurcates .",
    "the critical surface equatorial velocity @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radius of the star of mass @xmath0 , and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the opacity . above this threshold ,",
    "internal mixing processes are able to inhibit the formation of a strong compositional gradient in the star , which is otherwise built by nuclear burning in the stellar core . what ensues is a chemically homogeneous evolution .",
    "stars evolving this way avoid a core - envelope structure and become compact wolf - rayet stars already during h - burning .",
    "their core , which is not dramatically spun down by coupling with an extended envelope , retains a high angular momentum prior to collapse if the wind mass - loss is not too strong ( e.g. at low metallicity ) . on the other hand , stars below this threshold undergo a `` canonical '' evolution and experience a rsg phase , with their core losing a substantial amount of angular momentum .",
    "the precise value of @xmath18 is firstly a function of the mass of the star , with a further dependence on metallicity .",
    "more massive stars evolve chemically homogeneously at a lower value of @xmath24 .",
    "this is because the eddington - sweet circulation , which , beside convection , is believed to be the dominant mixing process during the main sequence of rotating massive stars , has a timescale proportional to the kelvin - helmholtz time scale , @xmath25 . for main sequence stars",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz timescale decreases with increasing mass .",
    "moreover , in massive stars the increasing radiation pressure weakens the entropy barrier , resulting in more efficient internal mixing ( yoon et al .",
    "on the other hand , higher metallicity means an increasing amount of mass loss ( and hence angular momentum loss ) through line - driven winds .",
    "this tends to slow the star down , requiring a larger value of @xmath24 for the star to follow the chemically homogeneous branch .",
    "note that even if a star begins evolving chemically homogeneously on the zero age main sequence , its wind can quickly remove angular momentum and the star moves back to a canonical evolution . in our calculations",
    "mass loss has been implemented according to the recipe described in yoon et al .",
    "note that massive rotating stars can approach critical rotation during their evolution , which is expected to lead to an enhancement of the stellar mass loss .",
    "this is calculated according to the prescription ( see sec .  6.4 in paxton et al .",
    "2013 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the surface angular velocity , and @xmath28 is the critical angular velocity at the surface ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the equatorial radius at breakup , which is 1.5 times the polar radius ) .",
    "the mass loss timescale is limited to the thermal timescale of the star @xmath31 @xmath32\\,.\\ ] ] convective regions are determined according to the ledoux criterion .",
    "semiconvection according to the prescription of langer et al .",
    "( 1983 ) is used , with a parameter @xmath33 .    in order to explore a significant parameter space in velocity , mass , and metallicity",
    ", we use mesa to evolve a grid of 60 models , characterized by 3 values of metallicity , ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , 4 values of mass ( @xmath36 ) , and 5 values of surface rotation velocity ( @xmath37 @xmath19 ) . as",
    "our `` standard '' set of models , we consider calculations that include internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques .",
    "these magnetic fields arise in radiative zones and are believed to be produced by dynamo action transforming part of the rotational energy into magnetic energy ( spruit - tayler dynamo ; spruit 2002 ) . while the reality of this dynamo loop in stars is currently debated ( e.g. , braithwaite 2006 ; zahn et al .",
    "2007 ) , models including this extra angular momentum transport mechanism do a much better job predicting the final spin rate of compact remnants ( heger et al . 2005 ; suijs et al . 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , we have adopted here as our standard evolution one that includes magnetic coupling . however , for a few significant cases , we also explore the influence on the results of the lack of magnetic fields during evolution . whenever we need to refer to a specific model within the standard set",
    ", we will use the notation zxxmyyvzz , where xx is the percentage of solar metallicity , yy is the mass in solar units , and zz is the percentage of the critical velocity .",
    "the mesa runs are set up to proceed until the onset of core collapse , defined as the moment when any part of the fe core is falling with a velocity @xmath38 ; however , for some models , the timestep adopted by mesa past core carbon burning become prohibitively small .",
    "as at this time the star has only a few years to live , the amount ( and distribution ) of angular momentum is not expected to change substantially . therefore the conclusions that we draw on the angular momentum distribution of the fallback matter are expected to remain robust , regardless of the particular endpoint , past core c - burning , chosen for the model .",
    "models at solar metallicity have been evolved using an artificial reduction of the superadiabaticity ( @xmath39 ) in radiation dominated convection zones . here",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are the actual temperature gradient and the adiabatic temperature gradient , respectively .",
    "this reduction is applied in regions where the mixing length theory ( mlt ) is out of its domain of applicability and mesa ( like other 1d stellar evolution codes ) struggles with very short timesteps .",
    "this approach ( mlt++ ) is thoroughly described in paxton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . in this study",
    "we reduced the superadiabaticity of @xmath42 models by a factor @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",
    "model at @xmath42 initially rotating at 37% of critical velocity.,width=302 ]    figures  [ fig : presn1 ] , [ fig : presn2 ] , [ fig : presn3 ] show the specific angular momentum distribution in the pre - sn stars for three values of the metallicity ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , and a range of zams rotational velocities between 0.25 and 0.75 of the critical value . for each of the models ,",
    "we also show the distribution of the spin parameter @xmath48 of the enclosed mass .",
    "while the above are our `` standard '' model , we also consider , for a few cases , how the pre - sn angular momentum distribution is modified in the case of no magnetic coupling .",
    "since this is of particular relevance for the possibility of forming fallback disks around ns remnants , we consider models which leave behind a ns .",
    "figure  [ fig : presn - nob ] shows a comparison between models with and without @xmath49 fields , for two solar metallicity models with mass @xmath50 and 20 @xmath7 and a rotational velocity of @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". also indicated is the minimum specific angular momentum for material to circularize just outside of a ns of mass equal to that of the iron core in the simulation , and a typical radius of 10  km .",
    "it is evident how the lack of magnetic torques results in a substantially larger specific angular momentum in the layers outside of the iron core .",
    "this is because the core of the star evolves essentially decoupled from the envelope , and is able to retain a large fraction of its initial angular momentum .     to assess the effect of the adoption of the mlt++ in our solar metallicity models",
    ", we evolved a 20@xmath53 model initially rotating at 37% of its critical velocity , with and without the reduction of the superadiabaticity .",
    "a comparison of the final angular momentum distributions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : presn - mlt ] , revealing minimal differences between the two calculations . for models above @xmath54 at solar metallicity ,",
    "similar tests can not be performed , as in that case calculations that do not include the mlt++ can not reach core collapse ( this is the reason why mlt++ has been implemented in the first place , see paxton et al .",
    "2013 ) . in general , we expect the integrated mass and angular momentum loss to be affected by the adoption of mlt++ , since this tends to change the surface stellar radius ( hence surface temperature , entering the calculations of the mass loss rate ) .",
    "such uncertainty is even larger for rapidly rotating models , where the evolution of the stellar radius ( affected by the efficiency of energy transport in the stellar envelope ) has an important role in determining the amount of mass lost at critical rotation .",
    "until a better theory for energy transport in radiation dominated zones is available , we have to consider these results highly uncertain .",
    "since the models at solar metallicity have not been considered for the explosion calculations ( disk formation is marginal for @xmath42 ) , the adoption of mlt++ does not affect the stellar explosions calculations presented in sec .",
    "3 and , overall , the major conclusions of this paper .",
    "the fate of the material ejected during the explosion depends on both its specific angular momentum , as well as on the energy of the explosion , which determines the amount of mass that remains bound , and hence falls back .",
    "the latter is discussed in the following section .",
    "the fallback dynamics are computed by means of direct numerical calculations of the explosion .",
    "these calculations are performed using a one - dimensional version of the tess code ( duffell & macfadyen 2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "tess is a multi - dimensional moving - mesh hydrodynamics method , which is both lagrangian and shock - capturing . as a result",
    ", the expansion of the shock through the many layers of the star is captured very accurately .",
    "each calculation is initiated as follows : the final state of a mesa run is used as initial conditions for the density and pressure of the star .",
    "the mass of the iron core is subtracted from this density profile and re - introduced as a point mass , to simulate the formation of the compact object .",
    "a fixed thermal energy is then added within a small radius ( 1.5 times the radius of the core ) , which causes an expansion and accelerates a shockwave which pushes its way out of the star .",
    "the inner boundary is initially reflecting for the first phase of evolution , as the gas is accelerating .",
    "after this thermal energy has been converted into kinetic energy in the shockwave , fallback can begin ( this typically takes about 10 seconds ) . at this point",
    ", we switch the boundary to be absorbing , and mass can freely pass through the inner boundary and be added to the compact point mass at the origin . after the shock has crossed a given radius r , fluid elements interior to this radius have been accelerated and can either escape the gravitational potential of the interior mass , or freely fall back . at",
    "any given time , we can define a critical radius , @xmath55 , as the largest radius such that all material interior to it is bound .",
    "we calculate this radius and measure the amount of mass in its interior , @xmath56 , as a function of time . at late times , this mass asymptotes to a finite value @xmath57 , which is the total fallback mass .     for each pre - sn model",
    ", we simulated the star explosion for a broad range of explosion energies .",
    "we note that the mechanism for core collapse supernova explosions remains a topic of current intensive research . indeed , many detailed numerical simulations ( e.g. herant et al .",
    "1994 ; burrows et al 1995 ; woosley & janka 2005 ; review by janka et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) are not able to achieve a successful explosion , especially for the higher mass stars . since the explosion dynamics depends on complex non - linear interactions between neutrinos interacting with fluid in a turbulent `` gain '' region ( e.g. liebendorfer et al . 2005 ) , it is still not possible at present to calculate the explosion energy with any certainty . in the future , high resolution 3d simulations with full neutrino transport schemes may be able to solve this problem . lacking a definitive detailed calculation for the explosion dynamics",
    ", the precise kinetic energy released must be constrained by observations .",
    "here we have used a range of kinetic energies consistent with observations as well as with the recent literature ( e.g. nomoto et al .",
    "2006 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "fallback masses for a range of star models and explosion energies are plotted in figure  [ fig : fallback ] ; in particular , for the standard models with magnetic coupling , we simulated the explosion of stars with metallicities of @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the solar value , since the possible formation of a disk is marginal at solar metallicity in these models .",
    "note that , due to computational limitations , we do not explicitly evolve the system to all the way to fallback , as this process can take an arbitrarily large amount of time for marginally bound fluid elements .",
    "typically we evolve the system for a time @xmath60  seconds .",
    "we should further note that , for some models , this running time is not even enough for the shock to push its way through the entire star .",
    "in particular , models with extended envelopes which have not undergone substantial mass loss take a very long time for the shock to cross the star ( @xmath61  seconds ) .",
    "this was generally found to be the case in the models with slow rotation ( @xmath62 ) , and also for the @xmath59 metallicity example at moderate rotation ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "longer run - times are computationally expensive , especially given the large number of models and explosion energies being calculated here .",
    "however , for these cases , the outer layers of gas have a relatively low binding energy , and hence even a very weak explosion can unbind this mass .",
    "if the explosion energy is much larger than this binding energy , we expect the results to not depend sensitively on the outer layers .",
    "for a few of the models ( in particular z1m13v32 and z10m13v32 , see sec .",
    "4.2.2 ) , we have explicitly run the calculation to a much longer time , @xmath64  seconds , to verify that these outer layers do indeed behave as we expect them to .    for the reasons mentioned above , we have found in practice that the details of these marginally - bound outer layers are only important for very weak explosions . for these models ,",
    "we have omitted the low - energy results from figure  [ fig : fallback ] , so that the only data included represent simulations for which either the shock has crossed the star , or the outer layers do not significantly affect explosions of the given energy .",
    "in the following , we couple the results from the previous two sections to discuss the post - sn phenomenology of the ejected material . we treat the ns and bh cases separately .    for each star model , in order to establish whether the iron core immediately collapses to a ns or a bh , we track its mass . for the models we studied ,",
    "masses are below @xmath65 in all the cases .",
    "a ns is expected to be the common outcome of the implosion of the iron core immediately after the sn explosion ( and sub - solar metallicity ) a bh can be formed by direct collapse . ] . however , for a large range of explosion energies enough material is expected to fall back and form a bh .",
    "bh formation from fallback has been widely discussed in the literature ( e.g. heger et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the following , for both nss and bhs",
    ", we will focus our discussion on the angular momentum of the material that falls back , and hence on the possibility of the existence of a short or long - lived fallback disk .    for",
    "a fallback disk to be formed , a fraction of material must remain bound , and it must possess a specific angular momentum @xmath66 at least as large as the angular momentum at the last stable orbit , @xmath67 .",
    "the bound fraction of the stellar envelope at radius @xmath21 will fall back on a timescale on the order of the free - fall time @xmath68 where @xmath0 is the enclosed mass inside radius @xmath69 .",
    "the maximum radial distance , @xmath70 , reached by each parcel of material is determined by the details of the explosion , with the explosion energy playing the most important role .",
    "we compute the post - explosion density profile of the gas as described in sec .  3 .",
    "each bound parcel of gas , of specific angular momentum @xmath66 , after falling back will circularize at a radius @xmath71 given by the solution of the equation @xmath72 .",
    "once the bound material has fully circularized in a ring , the following evolution occurs on the viscous timescale ) represents the classical viscous timescale , material can flow at a faster rate if transition fronts ( see e.g. menou et al 1999 ) are present ( cannizzo 1998 ; kotko & lasota 2012 ) . ]",

    "while fallback still proceeds , is determined by the longer of the two timescales above .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the material , and its observable phenomenology , will depend on the initial @xmath80 , as well as on the location at which the fallback ring of material circularizes .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss the expected initial conditions of the high-@xmath17 fallback material for the wide range of progenitor stars and explosion energies considered here .",
    "we begin with the discussion of the expectations for our standard models with magnetic torque .",
    "the remnant compact objects are nss for strong explosions , with the precise value of @xmath4 depending on @xmath81 .    inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : presn1 ] , [ fig : presn2 ] and [ fig : presn3 ] shows that , if the stellar evolution proceeds under conditions of strong magnetic coupling , the outermost shells of material surrounding the newly born ns _ never _ possess sufficient angular momentum to be able to circularize into a disk , even for the fastest rotating main sequence stars at low metallicity . the circularization radius for the small shells of material just outside the ns is at most a couple of kilometers for the most favorable scenarios . in these situations , if those shells are not ejected during the explosion , that material will fall back and impinge on the ns surface before completing a full orbit .",
    "these sudden episodes of accretion might give rise to x - ray flashes immediately following the ns birth .",
    "however , the high opacity of the stellar envelope at those early times ( e.g. chevalier & fransson 1994 ) will make these re - brightenings difficult to observe .    the fate of the fallback material after the sn explosion is expected to be very different if magnetic torques do not play any significant role during stellar evolution . to explore this scenario , we ran two new sets of models ; each set has the same @xmath82 , but one case is with magnetic torques , and the other without . the comparative results are displayed in fig.[fig : presn - nob ] , for stars of solar metallicity .",
    "it is apparent that , lacking magnetic torques to slow down the interior layers , there is plenty of material with specific angular momentum large enough to circularize outside of the ns radius .",
    "however , the explosion energy needs to be rather fine - tuned so that not all the outer layers are ejected , nor too much of them falls back causing prompt collapse to a bh .",

    "the temporal power - law decay , @xmath93 , has been found before in similar types of fallback calculations ( macfadyen et al 2001 ) , which relied on an alike density profile to ours . , followed by a stepeer decay after a few hundeds of seconds , which , in their particular progenitor model , corresponded to a drop in the density profile . a direct correspondence between the fallback timescale in their model and ours ( as well as that of macfadyen et al . 2001 ) can not be made , since their computation did not include a simulation of the explosion and the consequent fallback delay due to the shock pushing out the material before it starts to fall back .",
    "also , if the explosion is strong and most of the material gets unbound such as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotns ] , then the steepening in @xmath80 is not seen since the outer parts of the star envelope , where the density drops , have become unbound . ] since the viscous timescale @xmath94 at the circularization radius is very short ( about a millisecond ) , and hence @xmath95 , the disk can be imagined as evolving through a series of steady - state configurations at very high accretion rates , varying between @xmath96  s@xmath97  s@xmath10 within a few hundred seconds .",
    "this is an accretion regime known as hyperaccretion .",
    "hyperaccretion around an ns , unlike the bh case , has received a rather limited attention in the literature .",
    "kohri et al ( 2005 ) analyzed the problem with the aim of searching for an extra energy source which may help supernova explode in numerical simulations .",
    "they pointed out how , due to the very high accretion rates , the accretion flow , once circularized into a disk , would be a neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ; popham et al .",
    "1999 ; narayan et al . 2001 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ) .",
    "their analysis showed that , under a wide range of conditions , strong outflows would develop , and carry away a large fraction of mechanical energy .",
    "this energy might then help in producing a successful supernova explosion .",
    "more recently , zhang & dai ( 2008 , 2009 ) studied the structure of a steady - state hyperaccretion disk around an ns , motivated by suggestions that the collapse of a massive star giving rise to a grb might be powered by accretion onto an ns instead of a bh . a fundamental difference between hyperaccretion onto an ns and onto a bh derives from the fact that the bh has an event horizon , while the ns has a hard surface .",
    "as a result , if the accreting object is a bh , the internal energy in the accretion flow can be advected inward into the event horizon without any energy release . on the other hand ,",
    "if the accreting object is an ns , the internal energy must eventually be expelled from the disk , since the ns surface prevents energy advection into the star .",
    "a hyperaccreting disk around an ns , similarly to the bh case , is very hot and dense , optically thick to photons , and hence cooling is dominated by neutrinos .",
    "the presence of the boundary layer at the ns surface , and the consequent inability of the ns to advect energy , causes an higher neutrino luminosity than in the case of bh hyperaccretion .",
    "such explosive events could therefore power long grbs .",
    "however , a quantitative comparison between the fallback accretion rate predicted by our numerical simulations ( cfr .",
    "fig.[fig : mdotns ] ) , and the temporal evolution of the luminosity observed in long grbs ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) can not be reliably made at this stage .",
    "as discussed above , the detailed way by which hyperaccretion around an ns proceeds is not well known .",
    "furthermore , the efficiency by which the fallback accretion rate gets converted into accretion rate onto the ns and/or into winds must be changing with time , depending on the magnitude of the fallback rate itself , since the accretion mode depends on @xmath80 , and the accretion rate onto the ns surface must remain eddington limited . and",
    "this is in addition to the uncertainty with which the accretion energy is then converted into @xmath98-rays during the prompt phase .",
    "also note that , if the remnant compact object is a rapidly spinning , highly magnetized ns as suggested as an alternative model for the long grb engine ( metzger et al .",
    "2011 ) , then the energy output ( and hence the possible signatures in the light curves ) may be dominated by the electromagnetic component rather than the accretion one .",
    "the above studies highlight the importance of the formation of hyperaccreting disks around nss for supernovae and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "our investigation shows that such disks can be formed , but under special conditions : ( i ) magnetic breaking must not be effective during the progenitor star evolution ; ( ii ) the explosion energy must be fine - tuned so that a fraction of mass remains bound , but only a small fraction , not exceeding a few tens of solar mass in order for the ns to remain stable , or else it would produce an accretion induced collapse of the ns into a bh , also characterized by an early hyperaccreting phase ( giacomazzo & perna 2012 ) .",
    "the disks discussed above , independently of their specific structure , and the presence or not of outflows , are characterized by being highly transient , with relatively short durations of at most several hundreds of seconds .",
    "given their formation within a few schwarzschild s radii , these disks get rapidly depleted before they can expand to sufficiently large radii and form the extended , low - accretion , and long - lived disks ( @xmath13  yr ) which have been widely discussed in the ns literature , as summarized in the introduction .",
    "therefore , we can robustly conclude that _ long - lived fallback disks around isolated nss are not expected to be common_. their formation would require a set of very fine tuned conditions , such as an explosion which is strong enough to unbound the innermost layers surrounding the ns , but anisotropic in such a way that some of the outer , high-@xmath17 layers were not affected and could fallback on a much longer timescale at much larger radii . mixing between layers with different initial angular momentum could further occur due to hydrodynamic instabilities ( e.g. fryxell , arnett & mueller 1991 ; chevalier , blondin & emmering 1992 ) .",
    "however , whether these instabilities could possibly lead to the formation of a small - mass disk at larger radii ( with everything inside emptied to avoid the accretion induced collapse of the ns to a bh ) would have to be investigated through detailed numerical simulations .",
    "the above considerations have not considered the potentially important effect of the interaction between the accreting matter and strong magnetic fields in the newly born nss .",
    "this is a topic which has received a considerable degree of attention in the literature , both analytically and semi - analytically ( e.g. illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; ghosh & lamb 1979 ; lovelace et al . 1995 , 1999 ; ikhsanov 2002 ; rappaport et al . 2004 ; eksi et al . 2005 ; dangelo & spruit 2010 ; piro & ott 2011 ) , as well as numerically ( e.g. hayashi et al .",

    "a strong magnetic field exerts a pressure on the accretion flow , which is able to balance the ram pressure of the accreting material at a radius on the order of the magnetospheric radius , @xmath99^{2/7}$ ] , where @xmath100 is the magnetic stellar moment ( e.g. davidson & ostriker 1973 ) .",
    "this radius defines approximately the inner boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "a magnetized ns is able to accrete only under the condition that , at the magnetospheric radius , the velocity of the rotating magnetosphere ( equal to the stellar angular velocity @xmath101 ) is smaller than the local keplerian velocity of the disk material , @xmath102 ; if this condition is not satisfied , a centrifugal barrier will inhibit accretion ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "the above condition can be equally reformulated by stating that the magnetospheric radius must be smaller than the corotation radius @xmath103 , which is the radius at which the keplerian frequency of the orbiting matter is equal to the ns spin frequency . for a hypothetical fallback disk not to be influenced by the magnetic field of the ns , the magnetospheric radius must not be larger than the corotation radius , which yields a lower limit onto the accretion rate , @xmath104 where @xmath105  g  @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 . other effects ( related to the presence of magnetic fields ) which can hinder the formation of a disk are dipole spin - down radiation and a neutrino - driven , magnetically - dominated wind ( thompson et al .",
    "2004 ; piro & ott 2011 ) .",
    "these yield , respectively , further limits on the accretion rate , @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the above equations , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is the mass - loss rate caused by the neutrino - driven wind .    in the case of the disks produced under the conditions discussed above ( negligible magnetic torques , strong explosion that leaves only the innermost few tens of solar masses bound )",
    ", we find that the very high accretion rates , @xmath113 , generally dominate over magnetic effects unless the ns is born with a magnetar - type field , and with a period on the order of the millisecond . in these cases",
    ", the ns - disk system would be in the propeller phase , and the disk may be disrupted through a combination of the transfer of accretion power and rotational power of the ns to the disk ( eksi et al . 2005 ) .    all together , the presence of strong magnetic fields in the newly born ns would only make the formation and survival of a hypothetical fallback disk even more difficult .",
    "however , we note that a possible avenue that might create the conditions for an extended disk at larger radii could occur through recycling of the matter expelled during the propeller phase , i.e. if some of the material which has gained angular momentum through momentum transfer at the magnetospheric radius during the propeller phase does not get unbound , and falls back at radii much larger than @xmath114 ( perna , bozzo & stella 2006 ) . while this is a possibility",
    ", we however note that it requires even more special conditions to be realized : negligible magnetic torques so that the innermost layers of material have @xmath115 , a strong explosion so that only a few tens of mass fall back ; strong ns @xmath49 field and short birth period to allow the propeller phase to set in , anisotropic conditions in the pulsar wind outflow so that the disk is not blown away , and constraints on the parameters @xmath49 , @xmath116 and @xmath80 so that a fraction of the propelled material does not get unbound .      for those stars which leave behind a bh remnant , the formation of a fallback disk , while being common in the less physically relevant @xmath117 case , is also relatively common when magnetic torques play a significant role in the post main - sequence evolution , unlike the ns remnant case .",

    "however , the distribution of the specific angular momentum would require rather fine - tuned conditions in order to produce an extended , long - lived fallback disk .",
    "for a very narrow range of explosion energies , a few tens of solar mass of material can fallback and circularize , but just outside the ns surface , hence resulting in a hyperaccreting , highly transient and short - lived disk .",
    "circularization of the outer layers of the envelope at some larger radii would require very special conditions in the explosion geometry : the innermost layers would need to be blown away ( or else the ns would quickly turn into a bh ) , while the outermost layers would need to receive very little of the explosion energy .",
    "these special conditions , coupled with the fact that models without magnetic torques are disfavored by observations of the periods of young pulsars , have led us to conclude that _ extended , long - lived fallback disks around isolated nss are not expected to be a common outcome of supernova explosions . _ * for explosion energies leading to bh remnants , we find that there is always a region in the @xmath182 parameter space for which fallback disks are a possible outcome , independently of whether magnetic torques play an important role in the evolution of the star . however , the size of these regions in the parameter space depends on the strength of the magnetic coupling .",
    "the explosion material from stars evolved with negligible magnetic torques is able to circularize even for solar - metallicity models with typical initial surface velocities @xmath183 . in the models with strong magnetic coupling ,",
    "on the other hand , fallback disks are common predominantly at lower metallicities ( consistent with what has been found by a number of previous investigations ) . *",
    "the lower metallicity , faster rotating stars , which lose the outer envelope during their evolution , possess compact fallback disks ( circularization occurs within a few tens of schwarzschild radii ) , which result in highly super eddington accretion rates .",
    "the typical fallback time is on the order of a few tens of seconds .",
    "the properties of these disks have been widely investigated in the literature as the engines powering long duration gamma - ray bursts , and we have briefly reviewed them here . * for very weak explosions ( or largely anisotropic explosions , with little energy released in the equatorial regions ) , even the outermost layers of the star can remain bound . in the slower rotating models , for masses @xmath184 and",
    "metallicities @xmath185 , these outer layers possess a large specific angular momentum .",
    "when they fall back , a relatively large mass , @xmath138 , circularizes at a large radius , @xmath186 . this outcome is common independently of the strength of magnetic torques , as long as the explosion is sufficiently weak or sufficiently asymmetric .",
    "+ these massive disks around bhs are expected to be long - lived , although the specifics are largely dependent on the properties @xmath187 of the main sequence star . for a typical massive star of @xmath188 , @xmath189 and metallicity in the range @xmath190 , we find that the outermost @xmath138 of material falls back on a timescale of several months to @xmath124  year , and circularizes at radii on the order of a few @xmath191  cm ( larger values correlate to lower metallicities of the main sequence star ) .",
    "the initial accretion rate is @xmath192  s@xmath10 . during the early hyper eddington phase ,",
    "when the viscous timescale is very short , these disks can extend to radii on the order of the au , where tidal forces would not be strong enough to disrupt large gaseous bodies .",
    "these disks may harbor the conditions to form planets , hence leading to the possible existence of planets orbiting bhs .",
