    "solving a polynomial equation , @xmath0 has played a significant role in the history and development of science and mathematics .",
    "today the problem is present in every branch of mathematics and science , education and more , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "approximation of the roots is the only means for solving a general polynomial equations of degree five or higher .",
    "in fact , this happens to be true even for quadratics .",
    "newton s method is the most fundamental iterative method and is usually considered in the context of computing real roots of real polynomials .",
    "cayley @xcite considered newton s method for complex polynomials and studied its convergence properties for computing the roots of unity , solutions of @xmath1 .",
    "given a real or complex polynomial @xmath2 , newton s method continuously applied to each _ seed _ @xmath3 generates a sequence @xmath4 , called an _",
    "orbit_. the _ basin of attraction _ of a root @xmath5 of @xmath2 under newton s method is the set of all complex numbers whose corresponding orbit converges to this root .",
    "it is a classic result that newton s method locally converges quadratically . for studies on the mathematical properties of the dynamics of newton",
    "s method and , more generally , rational functions , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "cayley was only able to characterize the basin of attractions for quadratic polynomials . when the roots of a quadratic are distinct , each basin of attraction is the voronoi region of the root , the set of all complex numbers that are closer to that root than the other root .",
    "the analysis of basin of attractions for cubics and beyond is far more complicated .",
    "pathological cubic examples for newton s method can be given where the method fails to converge to a root on a set of positive measure : for instance , smale s example @xmath6 . deciding",
    "if , for a cubic polynomial , a particular orbit converges to a root is also highly complex , see blum et al .",
    "@xcite , who relates this to the undecidability problem over the reals .",
    "mcmullen @xcite shows that for almost all polynomials of degree at least @xmath7 , all iterative newton - like methods will be non - convergent on a set of positive measure .    in this article we introduce a hybrid method combining newton s method and the ellipsoid method .",
    "we apply our hybrid method to several examples , give corresponding polynomiography , and make comparisons with newton s method .",
    "as mentioned earlier , polynomiography is an algorithmic visualization in solving polynomial equations . in the next section ,",
    "first we summarize the basic properties of both newton and ellipsoid methods .",
    "we then describe the newton - ellipsoid method , provide the justification behind the method , and present some polynomiography .",
    "finally , we consider modifications and generalizations of the newton - ellipsoid method .",
    "to describe the newton - ellipsoid , first we acquaint the reader with the necessary ingredients .",
    "newton s method is an iterative approximation method for finding roots of a complex polynomial @xmath2 .",
    "given initial starting point @xmath8 , called a _",
    "seed _ , the _ newton s iterate _ and _ newton s direction _ at @xmath9 are defined , respectively as @xmath10      the ellipsoid method is an iterative method used in convex programming .",
    "its most famous application was in linear programming , by formulating problems as an lp feasibility problem and then solving a system of inequalities .",
    "linear programs have been proved to be solvable in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient in the method is the following fundamental property :    given an ellipsoid @xmath11 of dimension @xmath12 , and a half - space @xmath13 passing through its center , we can generate an ellipsoid @xmath14 that contains the half - ellipsoid @xmath15 , with the further property that the volume of @xmath14 is a fraction of the volume of @xmath11 , specifically @xmath16 repeating this process , one obtains a sequence of ellipsoids whose volumes shrink to zero . in this way , the ellipsoid method is applied to find a solution to the system of inequalities within a certain tolerance @xmath17 , in a finite number of iterations , polynomial in @xmath12 and @xmath18 . in particular , for @xmath19 , @xmath20    formally , given an @xmath21 symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath22 , and a point @xmath23 , an ellipsoid is defined as @xmath24 the center of the ellipsoid is @xmath25 , while its axis and their size is determined by the eigenvector and eigenvalues of the matrix , respectively .",
    "given @xmath26 , the half - space through the center of the ellipsoid having normal equal to @xmath27 is @xmath28 the half - ellipsoid is @xmath29 the ellipsoid of least volume that contains @xmath30 is @xmath31 , where @xmath32      we identify a complex number @xmath33 with the point @xmath34 in the euclidean plane .",
    "[ fta ] * ( kalantari @xcite ) * given a point @xmath8 in @xmath35 , consider the half - space @xmath36 , passing through @xmath8 whose normal corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath2 has a root in @xmath36 .",
    "computing a priori bounds on zeros of polynomials is a classic problem , see e.g. @xcite . given a polynomial @xmath2 we can generate bounds on the modulus of its zeros . specifically , for each integer @xmath38 one can generate a bound on the modulus of zeros of @xmath2 , see @xcite . using these bounds",
    "we can generate a tight initial rectangular region needed to start the newton - ellipsoid algorithm .",
    "we describe the first few bounds .",
    "let @xmath39 be the unique positive root of the polynomial @xmath40 .",
    "assume @xmath5 is any root of @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and we have @xmath43    for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and we have @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and we have",
    "@xmath49      we now describe the newton - ellipsoid method in further detail .",
    "the method is a combination of newton s method and the ellipsoid method .",
    "the general approach is follows : given a polynomial @xmath2 , first compute an initial box that contains all the roots .",
    "given an initial seed @xmath8 in the box , we can easily compute the smallest disc that contains the box and has @xmath8 as its center .",
    "the disk s radius is simply the distance from @xmath8 to the farthest point in the box ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this disc is our initial ellipsoid @xmath50 .",
    "next we compute the newton direction at @xmath8 , @xmath51 .",
    "while newton s method would take the new point , @xmath52 to be the sum of the old point and its newton s direction , we instead consider the half space @xmath36 whose normal is @xmath53 .",
    "we draw smaller ellipsoid @xmath54 containing the intersection between the half space and @xmath50 .",
    "because by theorem [ fta ] there exists a root in the direction of @xmath51 , @xmath54 must contain a root as well .",
    "we take the next iterate @xmath52 to be the center of @xmath54 and repeat the process .",
    "see figures [ fig1]-[fig3 ] .",
    "the idea is that the newton - ellipsoid method - in some instances - will be better - behaved than newton s method , and take a larger iterative step .",
    "however , while @xmath54 must necessarily contain a root of @xmath2 , @xmath55 may not contain a root , because the newton direction at the center of @xmath54 may be in a direction of a root that is not in @xmath54 .",
    "in other words , we run the risk of iterating to a root far away from our original seed .",
    "however , with the assumption that newton direction always points to the nearest root and that the ellipsoid centers will never go outside of the initial box , we can guarantee that the sequence of centers converge to a root of @xmath2 .",
    "formally , the algorithm is described in the box bellow .",
    "( box )    * newton - ellipsoid algorithm * ( @xmath2 , @xmath56 )    * * step 0 . * * ( initialization ) * compute a bound on the modulus of roots .",
    "let @xmath57 be a rectangle containing the roots .",
    "pick @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 be the distance from @xmath8 to farthest point of @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the circle of radius @xmath59 centered at @xmath8 , thus @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the @xmath63 identity matrix .",

    "go to step 1 .",
    ";      here we offer a justification that the iterates will converge to a root .",
    "assume @xmath2 is a monic complex polynomial of degree @xmath71 . by the fundamental theorem of algebra we can factor @xmath2 as :",
    "@xmath72 . since @xmath73 , @xmath74",
    "we see that when @xmath75 is a simple root of @xmath2 and @xmath76 is close enough to @xmath75 then @xmath77 thus newton s direction points toward the closest root , namely @xmath75 .",
    "if our goal is to compute one or more roots of @xmath2 , we can pick a random @xmath8 and apply the newton - ellipsoid method .",
    "if the corresponding sequence does not converge we can pick another initial point and repeat the process .",
    "once a root is approximated by deflation we can repeat the process to find other roots .",
    "given a complex polynomial @xmath2 , the _",
    "basic family _ of iteration functions is the collection of iteration functions defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and , @xmath82 satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath83    the first two members of the basic family are @xmath84 ( newton s method ) and @xmath85 ( halley s method ) . for the rich history of history and fundamental properties of the basic family members and applications , see @xcite . for each fixed @xmath38 , there exists a disk centered at a root @xmath5 such that for any @xmath8 in this disk , the sequence of fixed point iteration @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is well - defined , and converges to @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 is a simple root , the order of convergence is @xmath88 .",
    "there are voronoi properties in using the basic family members collectively . for a pointwise convergence property",
    "see @xcite , and for a uniform convergence proof of , see @xcite .",
    "the pointwise convergence property is the following :    [ thm2 ] for any root @xmath5 of @xmath2 , let @xmath89 be its voronoi region , i.e. the set of all complex numbers that are closer to @xmath5 than any other root . then given any @xmath90 , @xmath91    with respect to the use of the ellipsoid method",
    ", we can define the _",
    "basic family direction _ of order @xmath88 at a given @xmath8 to be @xmath92    analogous to newton - ellipsoid method , we define the generalized ellipsoid method using the above direction to define a hyperplane passing through each @xmath8 . however , a generalization of theorem [ fta ] needs to be proved .",
    "nonetheless , we will offer present polynomiography for higher order members as well .",

    "the justification in using the term polynomiography , is described in @xcite .",
    "one typical property that is revealed via polynomiography is the basin of attractions of the roots .",
    "starting with a grid of points around the origin , the initial rectangle @xmath57 containing the roots , we took at most 60 newton - ellipsoid steps for each point , and then colored each point based on convergence to a root , or lack of convergence ( colored black ) .",
    "we examined several polynomials , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath6 ( the aformentioned pathological case for newton s method ) . in all examples we used the rectangle with vertices @xmath95 .",

    "these represent points that diverge ( i.e. that fail to converge to a root of @xmath94 ) .",
    "we attempted to lower the number of black dots by increasing both the number of iterations and the density of the grid .",
    "however , these did not significantly seem to decrease the density of dark points .",
    "it may happen that a point @xmath8 that is near a root at the outset will move to a point far from that root in early iterations when the enclosing ellipsoid is large .    comparing the images of @xmath94 and @xmath6 under newton s method and newton - ellipsoid method , we see clear differences in behavior . while using newton s method yields more predictable convergence patterns",
    ", it also results in dense regions of divergence .",
    "however , while newton ellipsoid appears to be slower in speed than newton s , it s fundamental advantage as a root - finding method is the seemingly lack of regions of divergence with positive measure . using higher - order ellipsoid methods , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 ,",
    "seemed to make the general shape of basins of attraction look closer to voronoi region of the roots .",
    "next we describe how to improve the speed of newton - ellipsoid methods .",
    "one of the important practical algorithms in computing all the roots of a polynomial is weyl s algorithm , see @xcite .",
    "weyl s algorithm is two - dimensional version of the bisection algorithm .",
    "it begins with an initial `` suspect '' square containing all the roots .",
    "given a suspect square , we partition it into four congruent subsquares . at the center of each of the four subsquare",
    "we perform a proximity test , i.e. we estimate the distance from the center to the nearest zero .",
    "if the proximity test guarantees that the distance exceeds half of the length of the diagonal of the square , then the square can not contain any zeros and it is discarded .",
    "the remaining squares are called suspect and each of them will recursively be partitioned into four congruent subsquares and the process repeated .",
    "one of the application of bounds stated in this article is in performing proximity tests .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for details .",
    "however , we simply remark here that while using the newton - ellipsoid method at each input @xmath8 , we can perform a proximity test and try to estimate an initial disk centered at @xmath8 that would contain a root .",
    "this would avoid the use of large disk , hence decrease the number of iterations .",
    "we have not carried out any computational results with this approach .",
    "in this article we have introduced the newton - ellipsoid method and its generalizations .",
    "while newton - ellipsoid is computationally slower than newton s method , it compensates for this weakness by having no dense regions of divergence .",
    "thus , it may be a practical alternative to the use of newton s method . additionally , we offered some polynomiography which is interesting in its own right .",
    "the theoretical performance of the algorithm is a subject of future research .",
    "finally , we remark that since ellipsoid method is applicable to any dimension , assuming a generalization of theorem [ fta ] , the newton - ellipsoid can be applied to system of polynomial equations .",
