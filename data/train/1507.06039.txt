    "multi - band superconductors such as mgb@xmath7 and the iron pnictides have been attracted much attention because of its high critical temperature .",
    "although mgb@xmath7 is a phonon - mediated superconductor , it has a large critical temperature @xmath8k , originating from the multi - band effects .",
    "multi - band effects are recognized as one of the ways to increase the critical temperature .",
    "the discovery of the iron - pnictides had a striking impact on many researchers in condensed matter physics .",
    "many kinds of phenomena with multi - band effects have been proposed and confirmed in iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recently found superconductors characterized by topological invariants , _",
    "i.e. _ topological superconductors , are also multi - band superconductors , since the internal degrees of freedom ( _ e.g. _ spins , orbitals or particle - hole spaces ) in a multi - band system induce topological twists in wave functions@xcite .",
    "the huge computational cost originating from the multiple degrees of freedom prevents theorists from understanding the physical properties in multi - band superconductors .",
    "for example , in the iron - based superconductor lafeaso , the five - orbital two - dimensional tight - binding model has been used as the effective model@xcite .",
    "there are also ten - orbital three - dimensional tight - binding models as effective models to analyze experiments in another iron - pnictides.@xcite in addition , when dealing with vortices and surfaces in multi - band systems , the computational cost becomes huger , since the momentum is not a good quantum number in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "for example , in the topological superconductors , it is important to study the quasiparticle excitations so - called the majorana fermions around surfaces and vortices , in terms of the bulk - edge correspondence@xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau framework , which is usually used to examine the distribution of the order parameter in the inhomogeneous superconductors , is not suitable for dealing with the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "even if we use the mean - field framework such as the bogoliubov - de gennes framework , the simulations of the nano - size multi - band superconductors needs enormous computational costs .",
    "we point out that the effective models ( _ e.g. _ , derived by the first principles calculations ) might have too many bands to describe the low energy physics of superconductivity . we should note that the number of the bands crossing the fermi level in normal states is _ less than _ four even in models for iron - pnictides .",
    "the low energy physics in superconducting state are characterized by the quasiparticles on the bands crossing the fermi level in normal states , since a characteristic energy scale of the superconducting gap ( @xmath9mev ) is much smaller than that of the bands far from the fermi level ( @xmath9 ev ) . in the single - band weak - coupling bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs )",
    "framework , the theory using information only at the fermi surface , called the quasiclassical eilenberger theory , has many successes@xcite . in multi - band superconductors , eliminating the high - energy bands not crossing the fermi level can reduce the number of the bands in a low energy effective theory as shown in fig.[fig : feband ] , since the high - energy bands can not affect the physical quantities in superconducting state .",
    "the quasiclassical eilenberger theory is successful in the bcs model of superconductivity .",
    "the theoretical framework is based on the fact that the coherence length @xmath10 is sufficiently greater than the fermi wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "various kinds of analytical and numerical techniques on the quasiclassical eilenberger theory have been developed and successfully applied to the studies of a large number of conventional and unconventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "the eilenberger theory was applied into the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath3 . in the conventional models for mgb@xmath3 ,",
    "one neglects the off - diagonal inter - band elements in green s function . in this case",
    ", two decoupled eilenberger equations can describe the quasiparticle excitations , and the multi - band effects are included only through solving the gap equations@xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of bases to consider the multi - band systems .",
    "first one is the basis which is orthogonal in the momentum space ( so - called `` band''-basis ) .",
    "other is the basis which is orthogonal in the real space , such as the @xmath12-orbitals in models for iron - based superconductors and spins in a model with the spin - orbit coupling term .",
    "we call these real - space orthogonal basis `` orbital '' basis in this paper . in the quasiclassical eilenberger theory ,",
    "the quasiclassical green s functions depend on the momentum of the relative motion in momentum space and the center - of - mass coordinate in real space . in the previous multi - band",
    "quasiclassical theories@xcite , the decoupled eilenberger equations are used by neglecting the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian in both band basis in momentums space and orbital basis in real space . in the case of the two - band model for mgb@xmath3 , this assumption is valid to describe the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "there is , however , no eilenberger theory which includes the off - diagonal inter - band elements , except for a perturbative approach@xcite .",
    "the inter - band elements of green s function are important in the complicated multi - band systems , such as the iron - pnictides and the topological superconductors .",
    "for example , the iron - based superconductors have many entangled fe-@xmath13 orbitals at the fermi level .",
    "the hamiltonian proposed in the iron - based superconductors is diagonalized in momentum space by the momentum dependent unitary matrix .",
    "the ratio of which orbital is dominant originates from this unitary matrix and depends on the momentum .",
    "this `` orbital '' character , how the orbitals are entangled , at the each fermi wave number is important to understand the physics in iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal inter - band elements of green s functions are induced by those of the unitary matrix .",
    "these off - diagonal elements become important when a self - energy is induced by an inter - band scattering , which is important in a system with impurities or vortices . a model of topological superconductors",
    "usually have the off - diagonal elements in spin - space due to a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spins rotate in momentum space , originating from the spin - orbit coupling so that the hamiltonian is not diagonal with the use of spin basis in real space .",
    "the `` spin '' character , how the spins are entangled , induces topological superconductivity even in system with @xmath14-wave on - site pairing interaction in two dimension@xcite .",
    "therefore , the information about `` orbital '' characters in momentum space is important factor to describe multi - band effects .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a quasiclassical eilenberger framework in multi - band superconductors with a systematic low - energy projection . by eliminating the high energy bands far from the fermi level",
    ", we derive the multi - band andreev equations and quasiclassical eilenberger equations in the projected space constructed from the bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "we show that the resultant multi - band eilenberger equations are similar to the single - band ones , except for some corrections to describe multi - band effects .",
    "the quasiclassical framework uses the fact that the coherence length @xmath10 is usually longer than the fermi wave length @xmath11 in a lot of superconductors .",

    "<S> we propose the general multi - band quasiclassical eilenberger theory of superconductivity to describe quasiparticle excitations in inhomogeneous systems . with the use of low - energy projection matrix , the @xmath0-band quasiclassical eilenberger equations </S>",
    "<S> are systematically obtained from @xmath1-band gorkov equations . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the internal degrees of freedom in the bands _ crossing _ the fermi energy and @xmath1 is the degree of freedom in a model . </S>",
    "<S> our framework naturally includes inter - band off - diagonal elements of green s functions , which have usually been neglected in previous multi - band quasiclassical frameworks . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant multi - band eilenberger and andreev equations are similar to the single - band ones , except for multi - band effects . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - band effects can exhibit the non - locality and the anisotropy in the mapped systems . </S>",
    "<S> our framework can be applied to an arbitrary hamiltonian ( e.g. a tight - binding hamiltonian derived by the first - principle calculation ) . as examples </S>",
    "<S> , we use our framework in various kinds of systems , such as noncentrosymmetric superconductor cept@xmath2si , three - orbital model for sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 , heavy fermion cecoin@xmath5/ybcoin@xmath5 superlattice , a topological superconductor with the strong spin - orbit coupling cu@xmath6bi@xmath3se@xmath2 , and a surface system on a topological insulator . </S>"
