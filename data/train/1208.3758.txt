    "stars are the result of the gravitational collapse of cold gas , but on large scales the conversion of cold gas into stars takes much longer than a collapse time .",
    "early explanations for this low star formation rate ( sfr ) involved the magnetic support against the collapse of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , while the more recent scenario of turbulent fragmentation relies on the support of gmcs by supersonic turbulence @xcite . however , numerical simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds have generally failed to yield sfrs as low as observed values ( see   4 ) .",
    "this work shows that supersonic mhd turbulence results in a sfr as low as observed in gmcs , for characteristic values of the free - fall time divided by the dynamical time , @xmath0 , the alfvnic mach number , @xmath1 , and the sonic mach number , @xmath2 ( defined in   2 ) . using a very large set of adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) simulations of driven mhd turbulence , including self - gravity and sink particles",
    ", we quantify the dependence of the sfr per free - fall time , @xmath3 , on @xmath0 , confirming the results of our previous uniform grid simulations in the case of a very weak mean magnetic field .",
    "the sfr per free - fall time is the efficiency factor of a theoretical schmidt - kennicut law , @xmath5 often used in models and simulations of star formation in galaxies .",
    "we find that @xmath3 decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath0 , has no dependence on @xmath2 alone , and varies by less than a factor of two with variations in @xmath1 within reasonable values for star - forming regions .",
    "we therefore propose a new empirical law of star formation that depends only on @xmath0 .",

    "we have chosen two different values of the mean magnetic field , corresponding to rms alfvnic mach numbers of @xmath14 and 5 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the alfvn velocity corresponding to the mean magnetic field and the mean density .",

    "is suppressed @xcite , and the magnetic energy growth saturates at approximately 2% of the kinetic energy of the turbulence , when the mean magnetic field is negligible and does not characterize the system @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mean magnetic field is not negligible , as in our simulations and in real gmcs , it is readily amplified , well beyond the dynamo saturation level , by stretching and compression in the turbulent flow , and thus its saturated rms value depends directly on its mean value , as found in simulations of @xcite , and in equation ( 20 ) of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath1 , defined with the mean magnetic field , characterizes the saturated regime and can be taken as a fundamental parameter of the system .",

    "the five initial turbulence simulations have a root grid of 128@xmath27 computational cells and 5 amr levels , thus a maximum resolution equivalent to 4,096@xmath27 cells . in all runs ,",
    "the first amr level is created if the density is 2.5 times larger than the mean .",
    "subsequent amr levels are created when the gas density increases by a factor of 4 relative to the previous level .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , we do not refine based on velocity or pressure gradients .",
    "however , we verified that the tails of the density pdfs are sufficiently converged in the turbulence simulations used as initial conditions ( details will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "when self - gravity is included , the root grid is reduced to 64@xmath27 cells , while the number of amr levels is increased from 5 to 8 , to achieve a maximum resolution equivalent to 16,384@xmath27 cells .",
    "sink particles are created in cells where the gas density is larger than @xmath28 times the mean density ( much larger than the maximum density reached in the initialization runs without self - gravity ) , if the following additional conditions are met at the cell location : i ) the gravitational potential has a local minimum value , ii ) the three - dimensional velocity divergence is negative , and iii ) no other previously created sink particle is present within an exclusion radius , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 in these simulations , where @xmath31 is the highest - resolution cell size ) .",

    "the ratio @xmath0 expresses the relative strength of gravity and turbulence , like the virial parameter , @xmath35 , used in previous works .",
    "although formally equivalent to @xmath35 , for example through the usual expressions valid for a uniform sphere , we prefer to use @xmath0 as the third parameter , in line with the choice of the mach numbers ( ratios of crossing times as well ) as the first two parameters .    in table  1 , we also give the ratio between the minimum jeans length at each level , @xmath36 ( corresponding to the highest density before further refinement ) , and the computational cell size , @xmath37 , at that level . due to the refinement by a factor of two in size for every increase by a factor of four in density , the minimum number of cells per jeans length , @xmath6 , is the same for every level @xmath38 in a given simulation .",
    "the last column of table  1 shows the values of @xmath3 obtained from the simulations .    at the bottom of table  1",

    ", the sfr tends to grow with time . to extract a representative value , we measure @xmath3 as the slope of the least - squares fit of the sfe versus @xmath42 , in the interval @xmath43 , as in @xcite .",
    "the simulations with the lowest values of @xmath3 were not integrated up to sfe=0.2 .",
    "however , they do not exhibit a systematic growth of the sfr with time , and they are run for many free - fall times ( up to 9 in some cases ) , so their average @xmath3 is nonetheless well defined .",
    "the values of @xmath3 from all simulations are plotted in figure  3 , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "a striking result , stressed by the linear - log scale of figure  3 , is the approximately exponential dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 ( for fixed values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) , showing that supersonic mhd turbulence is very effective at slowing down the star formation process , which seems to be controlled primarily by the ratio of the characteristic times of gravity and turbulence .",
    "another important result is the lack of a dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath2 , for fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on @xmath1 is not very strong , considering the very large range of @xmath1 values of the simulations .",
    "this is in part due to the complex dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 . down to @xmath41",
    ", @xmath3 decreases with decreasing @xmath1 ( increasing magnetic field strength ) , while for further decreasing @xmath1 , @xmath3 starts to increase .",
    "figure  3 shows that a simple exponential law , where @xmath3 is only controlled by the ratio @xmath0 , could describe all simulation results within a factor of two . for even weaker magnetic fields than considered here , @xmath3 would certainly be larger , as it should approach the values found in simulations without magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , observations in star forming regions are consistent with @xmath44 @xcite , so it is likely that @xmath3 approaches its minimum value , which is approximately fit by a simple exponential law , @xmath45 , shown as a dashed line in figure  3 .",
    "we therefore propose a new empirical law of star formation , based on this fit to the minimum @xmath3 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 accounts for mass loss through jets and winds , during the formation of a star .",
    "this law only depends on the mean gas density and the rms velocity of a star - forming region , so it is easily implemented in analytical models and simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .    , versus @xmath0 .",
    "the symbols for each series of runs , where only the strength of gravity is changed and @xmath2 and @xmath1 are kept constant , are connected by a line , to better distinguish each series .",
    "the two error bars give the mean of @xmath3 , plus and minus the rms values , for each group of five @xmath40-root - grid runs with identical parameters ( @xmath13 and @xmath41 ) , but different initial conditions .",
    "the dashed line is an approximate exponential fit to the minimum value of @xmath3 versus @xmath0 . ]",
    "equation ( [ sfrff ] ) is valid as long as the fraction of the system mass , @xmath48 , available to form stars is larger than the characteristic stellar mass , @xmath49 , which we can express as @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath3 predicted by equation ( [ sfrff ] ) is too small to satisfy this condition , then @xmath51 , simply because the total system mass is too small . adopting the characteristic stellar mass predicted by our turbulent fragmentation model @xcite , @xmath52 , which corresponds to approximately three times the mean bonnor - ebert mass , @xmath53 , evaluated for an external pressure equal to the ram pressure of the turbulence , and using the minimum @xmath3 derived here",
    ", we find the condition can be expressed as @xmath54 .",
    "as shown by table  1 , the weakest gravity we have simulated corresponds to @xmath55 , giving @xmath56 and 38.6 for the runs with @xmath13 and 20 respectively . in good agreement with these values , in each of the @xmath13 runs with @xmath55 , we get only a single star , so the sfr is practically zero , while in the three @xmath17 runs with @xmath55 we get approximately 10 - 20 stars per free - fall time .    to test the numerical convergence of @xmath3",
    ", we have rerun three of the simulations with @xmath13 and @xmath41 , using both twice smaller and twice larger root grid size ( @xmath40 and @xmath39 computational cells ) , and the same number of amr levels , corresponding to maximum resolutions equivalent to 8,192@xmath27 cells and 32,768@xmath27 cells .",
    "these three larger runs were then rerun again using a 10 times larger value of the threshold density above which sink particles are created ( 10@xmath57 times the mean density , instead of @xmath28 ) .",
    "as shown in table  1 , the values of @xmath3 in the runs with @xmath58 and 1.09 are practically independent of numerical resolution , showing that the correct sfr can be derived even when truelove s condition @xcite is violated , and that the value of @xmath28 times the mean density ( adopted in the main parameter study ) , above which sink particles are allowed to form , is sufficiently high to avoid dense regions that are not collapsing .    in the case of @xmath59",
    ", @xmath3 is approximately 20% lower in the @xmath39-root - grid simulations than in the corresponding @xmath60-root - grid run .",
    "however , this low sfr is obtained from an average over many dynamical times . during the first dynamical time",
    ", the sfr is virtually independent of resolution .",
    "the corresponding simulation with @xmath40 root - grid size has the same value of @xmath3 as the largest simulations , showing that the difference from the @xmath60-root - grid run is not due to lack of convergence , but more likely to random differences between runs after a long time , as expected in chaotic systems .",
    "the values of @xmath3 from the @xmath39-root - grid simulations can be seen in figure  3 .    to investigate the effect of the initial conditions , we have carried out 10 simulations with twice smaller root grid size ( @xmath40 computational cells ) , and the same number of amr levels , five of them with @xmath61 , and the other five with @xmath59 , starting from different initial conditions of fully - developed turbulence , with @xmath13 and @xmath41 . as shown in table  1 , the maximum difference in @xmath3 from such small samples is approximately a factor of two .",
    "the mean values of @xmath3 , plus and minus the rms values , are plotted as error bars in figure  3 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 predicted by equation ( [ sfrff ] ) are consistent with those found in gmcs . as discussed in @xcite , accounting for the full uncertainty in the lifetime of the class ii phase ( @xmath62  myr ) , the results of @xcite implies @xmath63 - 0.12 . using the gmc sample by @xcite",

    "similar values are found also for the orion nebula cluster , @xmath68 - 0.09 , the object with the smallest error bars in @xcite .",
    "based on the values of @xmath0 in the sample of @xcite we would predict an average value of @xmath69 , while , based on the free - free emission , murray finds an average value of @xmath70 .",
    "the amr simulations with @xmath13 and @xmath14 presented here are consistent with our previous uniform grid simulations @xcite with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( the values of @xmath35 given in the plot of figure  2 are derived from @xmath0 based on the case of a uniform sphere , while those reported in figure  7 of @xcite were based on the total mass in the computational box , and should be multiplied by a factor of 2 for the comparison ) .",
    "the sfr model of @xcite adopted the simplifying assumption that , in the mhd case , the effective postshock ratio of gas to magnetic pressure , @xmath73 , and the density pdf do not depend on the mean magnetic field strength , for reasonable values of @xmath1 .",
    "the complex , but weak dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 found in the simulations justifies that approximation .",
    "however , by neglecting the dependence of @xmath73 on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the model yields a direct dependence on @xmath2 , not found in our amr simulations . equation ( 20 ) of @xcite , relating @xmath73 to @xmath2 and @xmath74 , the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure computed with the average magnetic field strength , @xmath75 , was derived under the assumption of flux freezing , neglecting the postshock thermal pressure and dynamical alignment of magnetic and velocity fields .",
    "@xcite noticed that when @xmath73 is averaged at high densities , it becomes independent of @xmath74 , so they took @xmath76 , which also provided a good fit to the density pdfs .",
    "however , they did not test the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath2",
    ".    it may be more physical to retain the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath2 even at high densities , because the postshock magnetic pressure tends to balance the ram pressure of the turbulence causing the shocks .",
    "assuming @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath3 practically independent of @xmath2 , as found in our amr simulations .",
    "this assumption yields a density variance in mhd given by @xmath79 , for @xmath80 , while the approximation @xmath78 in @xcite gave @xmath81 ( this issue will be addressed in a future study ) .",
    "although this correction eliminates the dependence on @xmath2 , the model does not predict the subtle dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 , as it does not account for the increasing anisotropy and dynamical alignment of magnetic and velocity fields , with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the simple empirical law derived above is a better choice for practical applications .",
