    "we now turn our attention to constructing cooperation strategies for the relay - eavesdropper channel .",

    "this motivates our noise - forwarding ( nf ) scheme , where the relay node does not attempt to decode the message but sends codewords that are _ independent _ of the source s message .",

    "the following comments are now in order .    1 .",
    "the nf scheme is customized to the relay channel with security constraints which make the transmission of codewords that are independent of the source message reasonable . also , in the nf scheme , the relay node does not need to listen to the source , and hence , this scheme is more suited works for relay nodes limited by the half - duplex constraint  @xcite .",
    "2 .   in nf cooperation",
    ", each user sends independent messages to the destination , which resembles the mac .",
    "hence , nf cooperation can be adapted to the multiple access eavesdropper channel where the multiple users in the mac channel can help each other in communicating securely with the destination without listening to each other ( note that the results in  @xcite were limited only to the case where the eavesdropped channel is a degraded version of the channel seen by the destination ) .",
    "our related results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "now , we study another cooperation scheme that does not require decoding at the relay : compress and forward ( cf ) .",
    "the cf cooperation strategy can be viewed as a generalization of nf where , in addition to the independent codewords , the relay also sends a quantized version of its noisy observations to the destination .",
    "this noisy version of the relay s observations helps the destination in decoding the source s message , while the independent codewords help in confusing the eavesdropper .",
    "the following result establishes the achievable rate - equivocation pair in the case when @xmath58 , _ i_.e . , the source - eavesdropper channel is better than the source - receiver channel , a situation of particular interest to us .",
    "[ thm : cf ] the rate pairs in the closure of the convex hull of all @xmath32 satisfying @xmath59^+,{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to @xmath60 for some distribution @xmath61 are achievable using cf strategy",
    ".    please refer to appendix  [ ap : cf ] .",
    "three comments are now in order .    1 .   in theorem  [ thm : cf ]",
    ", @xmath62 is the rate of pure noise generated by the relay to confuse the eavesdropper , while @xmath63 is the part of the rate allocated to send the compressed signal @xmath64 to help the destination .",
    "if we set @xmath65 , this scheme becomes the nf scheme .",
    "2 .   in order to enable analytical tractability ,",
    "the coding / decoding scheme used in the proof is slightly different from that of  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the destination uses sliding - window decoding , while our proof uses backward decoding .",
    "hence , the bound for @xmath66 provided here is a lower - bound for the @xmath66 achieved by the cf scheme",
    ". one may be able to achieve a larger @xmath66 using exactly the cf scheme proposed in  @xcite .",
    "but , unfortunately , we are not yet able to bound @xmath66 when sliding - window decoding is used .",
    "3 .   compared with cf decoding , the proposed nf strategy enjoys the advantage of simplicity . also , if one only focuses on the perfect secrecy rate , it is easy to see that these two schemes achieve identical performance .",
    "again , this observation is limited to our lower bound on @xmath66 in theorem  [ thm : cf ] .",
    "this section discusses several examples that illustrate some unique features of the relay - eavesdropper channel . for simplicity ,",
    "we only focus on the perfect secrecy rate of various schemes .",
    "the security constraints imposed on the network bring about a new phenomenon which we call the _ deaf helper phenomenon _ , where the relay node can still help even it is totally ignorant of the message transmitted from the source . in this setup",
    ", we impose an additional security constraint on the relay node , and say a rate @xmath67 is achievable for a deaf helper if for any @xmath33 , there exists a sequence of codes @xmath20 such that for any @xmath68 , we have @xmath69    in this case , the signal received by the relay node does not leak any information about the transmitted message @xmath70 .",
    "this model describes a more conservative scenario where the source does not trust the relay but still wishes to exploit the benefit brought by cooperation .",
    "we assume that the relay node is not malicious and , hence , is willing to cooperate with the source .",
    "the following theorem characterizes the achievable perfect secrecy rate of the nf strategy in the deaf - helper setting .",
    "[ thm : nfdeaf ] the perfect secrecy rate of the nf scheme with an additional security constraint on the relay node is @xmath71 where @xmath72^+ , { \\nonumber}\\\\{\\nonumber}r_{s2}&=&[i(v_{1};y|v_{2})-i(v_{1};y_1|x_{2})]^+.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    please refer to appendix  [ ap : nfdeaf ] .      in the classical relay channel without security constraints , there exist some scenarios where the relay node does not provide any gain , for example , the reversely degraded relay channel shown in  @xcite . here , we focus on this scenario and show that the relay node can still offer a gain in the presence of the eavesdropper .    the relay channel is called reversely degraded , if @xmath73 @xmath74    the following result , borrowed from  @xcite , states the capacity of the classical reversely degraded relay channel .",
    "the capacity of the reversely degraded relay channel is @xmath75    this result implies that the relay node should send a constant , and hence , does not contribute new information to the destination . in most channel models ,",
    "the constant sent by the relay does not result in any capacity gain .",
    "the question now is whether the same conclusion holds in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "we first observe that the degradedness of the relay channel implies that df and cf cooperation will not provide the destination with additional useful information .",
    "the relay node , however , can still send codewords independent of the received signal to confuse the eavesdropper , as proposed in the nf scheme . since we do not require decoding at the relay node in the proof of theorem  [ thm : nf ]",
