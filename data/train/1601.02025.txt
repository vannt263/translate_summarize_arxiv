    "it took more than four decades since the publication of the maxwell equations to establish their conformal invariance .",
    "thereafter the conformal symmetry became a subject of continuous interest in theoretical physics and the realm of its applications vast.@xcite    the conformal algebra in two - dimensional spacetime has the special property of having an infinite number of generators .",
    "this makes the symmetry especially powerful and makes conformal field theories in two - dimensional spacetime appealing .",
    "much work on them has been done in recent years ( see e.g. , and references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of this report is to discuss a novel classical conformal field theory , on an arbitrary two - dimensional riemannian spacetime background , in which the dynamical object is a space - filling string .",
    "if one considers an arbitrary but fixed system of coordinates @xmath0 on the background , a generic ( parametrized ) space - filling string is described by a function @xmath1 , and an infinitesimal deformation is the change , @xmath2    in two spacetime dimensions , and only then , that deformation may be described in a conformally invariant manner as , @xmath3 provided the normal @xmath4 is chosen to be weyl invariant , instead of being the customary unit normal .",
    "then the deformation parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 describe a conformal transformation , because the general integrability conditions of surface deformations@xcite imply that the corresponding generators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , obey the algebra of the conformal group,@xcite    @xmath9 & = \\left(s_{1}\\left(x\\right)+s_{1}\\left(x'\\right)\\right)\\delta'\\left(x , x'\\right),\\label{eq : hphp-1 - 1}\\\\ \\left[s_{1}\\left(x\\right),s_{\\perp}\\left(x'\\right)\\right ] & = \\left(s_{\\perp}\\left(x\\right)+s_{\\perp}\\left(x'\\right)\\right)\\delta'\\left(x , x'\\right)-\\zeta\\delta'''\\left(x , x'\\right),\\label{eq : hphi-1 - 1}\\\\ \\left[s_{1}\\left(x\\right),s_{1}\\left(x'\\right)\\right ] & = \\left(s_{1}\\left(x\\right)+s_{1}\\left(x'\\right)\\right)\\delta'\\left(x , x'\\right),\\label{eq : hihi-1 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the central charge @xmath10 is a constant with the units of an action.)([eq : hihi-1 - 1 ] ) can be decomposed as two copies of the virasoro algebra , @xmath11=\\left(l\\left(x\\right)+l\\left(x'\\right)\\right)\\delta'\\left(x , x'\\right)-\\frac{\\zeta}{2}\\delta'''\\left(x , x'\\right)$ ] , whose generators are given by @xmath12 .",

    "therefore if one fixes a reference cut @xmath15 there is a one - to - one correspondence between the functions @xmath1 and the conformal transformation whose effect is to deform @xmath15 into @xmath1 .",
    ", then ( [ eq : yl ] ) is equivalent to a change of the coordinates @xmath16 . therefore , a quantity , for example an action integral , will be invariant under changes in the spacetime coordinates if and only if it is conformally invariant . for this reason we will use both terminologies interchangeably in the text , depending on the desired emphasis . ]",
    "we will discuss herein a realization of the algebra ( [ eq : hphp-1 - 1])([eq : hihi-1 - 1 ] ) on a two - dimensional spacetime background , endowed with an arbitrary but given metric @xmath17 , in which _ the conformal symmetry generators are built out of the @xmath1 themselves and their canonical conjugates_.    in virtue of the fact that the deformation is described in a conformally invariant manner , one may say that the configuration space of the theory is the group space of the conformal group .",
    "the action and symmetry generators of the theory in question were found in ref .",
    ", as those of a particular  and especial``g - brane . '' the purpose of the present discussion is to bring out in a self - contained manner the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane as a classical conformal field theory , focusing on aspects that were not covered or emphasized in ref . .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : sec .",
    "[ sec : surface - deformation - algebra ] recalls the results obtained in ref . for the conformal generators of the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane , while sec .",
    "[ sec : action - principle ] discusses the action principle , the ( lack of ) conformal and weyl invariance of the action , and the equations of motion .",
    "[ sec : stress - tensor .- coupling ] is devoted to analyzing the energy - momentum tensor , the coupling to liouville matter , and the cancellation of anomalies .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec : concluding - remarks ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "to relate the infinitesimal deformation ( [ eq : yl ] ) to the conformal algebra , it is essential to bring in the metric @xmath18 in order to split @xmath19 into its normal and tangential components , @xmath5 and @xmath6 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltay ] ) .",
    "the normal @xmath4 appearing in that equation is defined by , @xmath20 where ,    @xmath21    is the metric on the cut @xmath1 . on account of ( [ eq : normal ] ) and ( [ eq : indmetric ] ) the normal @xmath4 is invariant under weyl transformations , @xmath22    the fields @xmath0 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are also weyl invariant because the background metric @xmath18 does not enter into their definition .",
    "we now recall the expressions for the generators @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained in ref . .",
    "if the canonical momenta conjugate to @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath25 , so that in terms of poisson brackets , @xmath26=\\delta_{\\rho}^{\\lambda}\\delta\\left(x , x'\\right),\\ ] ] the canonical generators that span the algebra ( [ eq : hphp-1 - 1])([eq : hihi-1 - 1 ] ) are realized in terms of the fields @xmath27 as , @xmath28 here , @xmath29 and , @xmath30 the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the local relative scale and extrinsic curvature of the space - filling string respectively .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the @xmath0as , @xmath33 @xmath34 the derivative @xmath35 is the covariant derivative in the external space projected onto the string .",
    "if in ( [ eq : l ] ) the field @xmath31 is regarded as a fundamental variable , and @xmath32 as its `` invariant velocity '' ; as opposed to being expressed in terms of the @xmath0 through ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : k ] ) , then @xmath36 appearing in ( [ eq : l ] ) becomes the lagrangian for an analog in two - dimensional spacetime of einstein s theory of gravitation , , , which is related to the liouville theory .",
    "if the replacements ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : k ] ) are implemented the `` gravitational ancestor '' ( [ eq : l ] ) gives rise to its descendant , the space - filling string .",
    "the action integral is given by , @xmath37    the weyl invariant lapse and shift functions @xmath38 are considered as external fields which are not varied in the action principle .",
    "they parametrize the most general conformal transformation whose unfolding in time is the dynamics of the system , generated by the hamiltonian , @xmath39 a particular case is , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which might be termed a `` rigid time translation '' , the corresponding hamiltonian is the integral of @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian is linear in the momenta because it is a linear combination of the generators @xmath42 @xmath8 , which have that property .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane .",
    "geometrically , it captures the fact that the motion may be considered as a displacement on the manifold of the conformal group ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) below ) .",
    "dynamically it implies that , independently of the sign of the constant @xmath10 , the `` energy density '' @xmath7 can be arbitrarily large and positive or negative . as a consequence of the linearity in the momenta they can not be expressed in terms of the velocities to obtain an action principle in terms of a lagrangian which would depend on @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this situation changes however when one couples the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane to matter as discussed in section [ lag ]",
    ".      it will be useful here to employ a standard compact notation to account for both continuous and discrete indices , so that , for example summation over @xmath45 includes an integration over an accompanying continuous index @xmath46 .",
    "the conformal algebra ( [ eq : hphp-1 - 1])([eq : hihi-1 - 1 ] ) then reads , @xmath47=\\kappa_{ab'}^{\\;\\;\\ ; c''}s_{c''}+\\zeta_{ab'},\\ ] ] where the structure constants @xmath48 are products of @xmath49-functions and the central term @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the conformal transformation of any functional @xmath51 of the dynamical fields @xmath0 and @xmath25 is given by its poisson bracket with the corresponding generator : @xmath52,\\label{eq : deltaf}\\ ] ] whereas the change of the `` conformal lapse '' and shift @xmath53 is given by , @xmath54    if one employs equations ( [ eq : deltaf ] ) and ( [ eq : deltaeta ] ) to evaluate the change in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) for a region @xmath55 with boundary @xmath56 , one finds    @xmath57    therefore , due to the central term , even when the boundary is mapped onto itself ( @xmath58 over @xmath56 ) , the action is not conformally invariant .",
    "this anomaly does not affect the equations of motion because the central term does not include the dynamical fields .      under an infinitesimal weyl transformations of the background metric ,",
    "@xmath59 the action ( [ eq : action ] ) transform as : @xmath60 the change ( [ eq : deltaweyl ] ) may be obtained by direct calculation , or , better , by realizing that it must be the same as the one of its gravitational ancestor mentioned at the end of the previous section . in that context eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaweyl ] ) is at the heart of the gravitation theory in two spacetime dimensions : demanding that it should vanish gives then the equation of motion , @xmath61 of the ancestor theory.@xcite      for general @xmath62 and @xmath63 the equations of motion are given by , @xmath64 these equations are conformally invariant because , as it was stated at the end of subsection [ sub : change - of - the ] the change in the action under a conformal transformation does not depend on the dynamical fields .",
    "comparison of equation ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) with equation ( [ eq : deltay ] ) shows that the motion may be considered as a displacement on the manifold of the conformal group .    to obtain insight",
    "we now consider the case in which the background is minkowski space and the external coordinate system is cartesian , that is @xmath65 furthermore we take at time @xmath66 @xmath67 while leaving the @xmath68 arbitrary , and further specialize to a `` rigid time translation '' , i.e. , @xmath69 for all times .",
    "then the solution of the equations of motion is : @xmath70 it is important to emphasize that the above solution _ is not _ the most general solution of the equations of motion when @xmath71 because the initial conditions ( [ eq : initial ] ) are very particular corresponding to a simple cut through the spacetime .",
    "the most general solution is obtained by acting on ( [ eq : solution ] ) with the conformal group through an iteration of transformations generated by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the result of this iteration is to go from the cut ( [ eq : initial ] ) to a generic spacelike cut @xmath72 , but the corresponding result for @xmath25 can not written in a closed form .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that different cuts @xmath72 do not correspond to different gauge choices , because @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not generate a gauge symmetry since they are not constrained to vanish .",
    "note that for the solution ( [ eq : solution ] ) the conformal energy density @xmath7 does not vanish when @xmath73 , but is given by the background energy , @xmath74",
    "one may define an energy - momentum tensor for the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane through the standard formula , @xmath75 as a consequence of the lack of invariance of the action under changes of the spacetime coordinates expressed by ( [ eq : lack ] ) , @xmath76 defined by ( [ eq : t ] ) not only is not conserved when the equations of motion ( [ eq : eom1])([eq : eom3 ] ) hold but its components do not even transform as those of a tensor under a change of the spacetime coordinates .",
    "this conformal anomaly is brought in by the presence of the central charge ( `` schwinger term '' ) in the commutation rule for the energy and momentum densities @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which are related to @xmath76 by , @xmath77    the remaining component , @xmath78 where , @xmath79 may be obtained from ( [ eq : deltaweyl ] ) to be , @xmath80 and it is a world scalar although @xmath76 is not a tensor .",
    "one may couple the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane by adding to ( [ eq : action ] ) the action of a `` matter field '' also described by a conformal field theory . that matter action will have a form similar to ( [ eq : action ] ) : @xmath81 the generators @xmath82 will obey the conformal algebra ( [ eq : hphp-1 - 1])([eq : hihi-1 - 1 ] ) . since they will be built out of @xmath83 and @xmath84 they will commute with those of the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane . therefore the generators of the complete theory , @xmath85 will obey the conformal algebra with a total central charge which is the sum of the central charges of the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane and that of the matter theory .",
    "there is one theory for a matter field which has a central charge at the classical level , that is the liouville theory for which , @xmath86 obey the algebra ( [ eq : hphp-1 - 1])([eq : hihi-1 - 1 ] ) with , @xmath87 the total central charge is then @xmath88      an interesting possibility now appears , namely that of adjusting the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane central charge @xmath10 for a given @xmath89 so that the sum ( [ eq : sum ] ) vanishes , @xmath90 for physical reasons , such as the positivity of the energy of the liouville field , it is desirable to have @xmath91 , however no similar restriction appears for @xmath10 because , as it was pointed out above , for any sign of @xmath10 the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane energy is unbounded from above and from below .    when ( [ eq : zetazero ] ) holds , and only then , one has the option of constraining the total generators to vanish ,",
    "@xmath92 if the total central charge were not to vanish equations ( [ eq : sptot ] ) and ( [ eq : s1tot ] ) would not be preserved under the action of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    before the constraints are imposed",
    "the complete theory is invariant under two independent conformal symmetries , one acting on the ( 1 + 1 ) g - brane , the other on the liouville field .",
    "there are independent parameters @xmath95 for each , which are not varied in the action principle .",
    "the two theories are decoupled and there are three degrees of freedom per space point .    if the constraints are imposed the only symmetry is a simultaneous conformal transformation of the same magnitude on both the brane and the liouville field .",
    "the common parameter @xmath95 is now varied in the action principle in order to yield the constraint .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom per point of the combined theory then decreases from three to one , and the brane and the liouville field become coupled through the constraint , although their equations of motion remain uncoupled .    when the total central charge vanishes , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetazero ] ) the complete action is invariant under spacetime reparametrizations because the anomalous term in ( [ eq : lack ] ) is proportional to @xmath96 . on the other hand",
    "the change of the complete action under a weyl transformation is still given by ( [ eq : deltaweyl ] ) because the liouville action is weyl invariant if one assumes @xmath84 to have that property .",
    "for the coupled action one may pass from the hamiltonian formulation to a lagrangian formulation by eliminating the constraints and the momenta from their equations of motion .",
