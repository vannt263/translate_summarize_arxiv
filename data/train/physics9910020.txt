    "it is well known that variations in the fluxes of relativistic electrons , of kinetic energies @xmath5 1 mev , in the inner magnetosphere ( @xmath6 ) are related to disturbed magnetospheric conditions commonly called  magnetic storms \" .",
    "typically , for many storms the electron fluxes diminish rapidly during the main phase of the storm .",
    "the main phase depletion of relativistic electrons occurs in association with large negative values of the interplanetary magnetic field @xmath7 and large sudden increases in the solar wind density and pressure @xcite .",
    "subsequently , during the recovery phase of the storm , fluxes increase to beyond pre - storm levels and peak about 4 days after the initiation of the storm @xcite . these enhancements in fluxes of relativistic electrons , which are colloquially referred to as  killer electrons \" , have become the subject of considerable attention by magnetospheric physicists .",
    "not only do the enhancements constitute an intrinsically interesting physics problem in the near - earth space , but they constitute a potentially serious hazard to satellites , space stations , and , conceivably , humans in space . in fact , satellite disfunctions (  anomalies \" ) have been linked to the effects of relativistic electron increases @xcite , and the state of the radiation belt environment has become a major concern in space weather forecasting [ e.g. , _ baker _ , 1998 ; _ reeves _ , 1998a ] .",
    "the region near geosynchronous ( or geostationary ) orbit , @xmath8 , in the geographic equatorial plane , is of particular interest because it is the operating zone of many orbiting satellites .",
    "_ reeves _ [ 1998b ] has recently examined the relationship between relativistic electron enhancements at geosynchronous orbit and magnetic storms as measured by the @xmath9 index . in particular , the 30 most intense relativistic electron events during 1992 - 1995 were examined , and it was found that every relativistic electron event was associated with a magnetic storm as indicated by the @xmath9 index , though a small fraction ( about 10% ) of magnetic storms did occur with no increase in relativistic electron fluxes .",
    "thus , one conclusion from _ reeves _ [ 1998b ] analysis is that intense solar wind conditions are necessary to generate strong relativistic electron enhancements . nevertheless , despite the accumulated magnetic storm data from satellites over many years , including coordinated observations from the international solar - terrestrial physics ( istp ) constellation of spacecraft and other multi - satellite missions [ e.g. , _ baker et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; _ reeves et al . , _ 1998 ] , there is , as yet , no accepted explanation for the generation of the relativistic electrons .",
    "specifically , it is not known exactly how , where , or when the electrons are accelerated .",
    "various energization mechanisms have been proposed , and most of these are reviewed by _",
    "li et al . _",
    "[ 1997a ] .",
    "it appears easier to explain the main phase depletion of energetic electrons than their subsequent recovery and enhancement .",
    "the drop in relativistic electron fluxes near geosynchronous orbit is partly due to adiabatic responses ( conserving all three adiabatic invariants ) to magnetic field decreases , as reflected in the reduction in @xmath9 index [ e.g. , _ kim and chan _ , 1997 ] . nevertheless , _",
    "li et al . _",
    "[ 1997a ] show that other physical mechanisms , including precipitation , must also contribute to the depletion .",
    "it has been suggested that radial diffusion @xcite , invoked to explain the existence of the outer electron radiation belt itself , could also generate electrons of mev energies in the inner magnetosphere .",
    "this mechanism , which involves inwardly transporting energetic electrons from a presumed source in the outer magnetosphere ( in the tail ) , can produce such energies during relatively quiet periods [ e.g. , _ selesnick and blake _",
    ", 1997a ] , although the process is too slow during active times @xcite . certain global recirculation processes , involving radial diffusion , have also been proposed to generate relativistic electrons [ e.g. , _ baker et al .",
    "_ , 1986 , 1989 ; _ fujimoto and nishida _ , 1990 ] , though these have proved inadequate , as the transport rates are too slow .",
    "_ sheldon et al . _ [ 1998 ] have recently identified the outer polar cusp region as a potential acceleration region of the magnetosphere and possible source of energetic electrons for the outer radiation belt , though further calculations are needed to evaluate the significance of the study . in another mechanism still to be fully evaluated , _ rostoker et al . _ [ 1998 ] and _ liu et al . _ [ 1999 ] make the case that large - amplitude ulf pulsations have the potential to supply the energy necessary to create the enhanced relativistic electron fluxes . in a 3d global mhd simulation of the rapid rise of relativistic electron fluxes during the january 1997 magnetic cloud event , _ hudson et al . _",
    "[ 1999a , b ] also found that ulf oscillations may play a role in energizing relativistic electrons , via a mechanism involving drift - resonant acceleration and radial transport .",
    "it is becoming increasingly apparent that electrons are accelerated to relativistic ( @xmath5 1 mev ) energies _ in situ _ in the inner magnetosphere [ e.g. , _ blake et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ] .",
    "significant evidence in support of this conclusion is the observation by _ selesnick and blake _ [ 1997b ] that the phase space density of electrons of greater than mev energies peaks near l=4 to l=5 during storms . as a result of substorm activity , electrons with energies up to @xmath10 kev",
    "are injected near geosynchronous orbit @xcite .",
    "these electrons appear to form the source population for the relativistic electrons of greater than mev energies that are subsequently observed .",
    "_ summers et al . _",
    "[ 1998 , 1999 ] have shown that whistler - mode waves could provide an effective mechanism for accelerating electrons from energies near 100 kev to above 1 mev in the region outside the plasmapause during the storm recovery phase . in a survey of potential wave modes for electron scattering and stochastic acceleration to relativistic energies during magnetic storms , _ horne and thorne _ [ 1998 ] concluded , in particular , that in low density regions of the magnetosphere where the electron gyrofrequency exceeds the electron plasma frequency , there are four potential wave modes that can resonate with electrons in the energy range 100 kev to a few mev : the whistler , lo , rx , and z modes .",
    "the concept of stochastic acceleration of electrons by whistler - mode waves in the magnetosphere has also been discussed by _",
    "temerin et al . _",
    "[ 1994 ] , _ li et al . _",
    "[ 1997a ] , _ temerin _ [ 1998 ] , and _",
    "roth et al . _ [ 1999 ] .",
    "it is the purpose of present paper to quantify the model presented qualitatively in section 8 of _ summers et al . _",
    "[ 1998 ] for the stochastic acceleration of relativistic electrons during geomagnetic storms .",
    "essential ingredients in the model are the spatial regions within the inner magnetosphere @xmath11 where enhanced whistler - mode chorus @xcite and enhanced electromagnetic ion cyclotron ( emic or l - mode ) waves occur @xcite ; see figure 1 .",
    "the aforementioned substorm - produced seed population of electrons in the energy range 100 kev to 300 kev have approximately circular drift paths within the region @xmath12 , and consequently will traverse the regions of enhanced whistler - mode chorus and enhanced emic waves . specifically , in this paper we shall model the acceleration of electrons during the storm recovery phase by means of second - order fermi ( or stochastic gyroresonant ) acceleration by weak whistler - mode turbulence . in a standard quasi - linear formulation , we construct a kinetic equation for the evolution of the electron energy distribution function .",
    "the equation contains an energy diffusion coefficient due to resonant whistler - mode wave / electron interaction , and an electron loss term due to pitch - angle scattering by both the whistler - mode and emic waves .",
    "we should point out here that the data from the solar , anomalous , and magnetospheric particle explorer ( sampex ) satellite @xcite show that bursty electron precipitation occurs as the electron flux increases during the storm recovery phase .",
    "such precipitation , together with the existence of an abundant supply of storm - produced lower - energy seed electrons @xcite are supportive of the model constructed in this paper . the model is presented in detail in section 2 , and numerical solutions are presented in section 3 .",
    "the solutions are compared with data on the electron energy distribution of high energy ( 300  2000 kev ) electrons at geosynchronous orbit .",
    "we find that stochastic gyroresonant acceleration by whistler - mode waves can indeed accelerate substorm - produced seed electrons in the inner magnetosphere to generate high - energy electron spectra of the type observed , following continuous injection of seed electrons over a timescale of several days .",
    "specific predictions of the model depend , of course , on the values taken for the model parameters . in section 4",
    "we briefly assess our findings and state our conclusions .",
    "the region to which the model constructed in this paper applies is that part of the inner magnetosphere during storm - time that is illustrated in the idealized , for @xmath11 .",
    "this region contains an extensive subregion of whistler - mode chorus , a smaller but intense region of emic waves , and also contains the important geosynchronous - orbit region near l=6.6 .",
    "figure 1 is a simplified version of figure 7 of _ summers et al . _ [ 1998 ] , which itself was constructed on the basis of observations and relevant theory @xcite .",
    "we assume that geomagnetic storm activity produces a seed population of electrons of energy @xmath13 kev as a source for the region specified in figure 1 .",
    "we are not concerned in this paper with the precise means ( transport , original source location , etc . )",
    "by which the source is supplied . according to standard particle drift theory [ e.g. , _ wolf _ , 1995 ] , the drift motion of  hot \" ( e.g. , 100 kev ) electrons close to the earth is dominated by gradient drift , with the result that electrons execute approximately circular drift trajectories eastward about the earth .",
    "thus , the storm - supplied source electrons constitute a quasi - trapped population traversing the whistler - mode and emic wave subregions illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "while executing the eastward drift , the electrons gyrate about the field lines and ` bounce ' between mirror points , during which time they also undergo both energy and pitch - angle diffusion , as a result of their interaction with the whistler - mode chorus and emic waves .",
    "we shall assume that the pitch - angle scattering rate is much greater than the energy diffusion rate ( see appendix a ) , so that the electron distribution will be nearly isotropic .",
    "further , we shall take account of pitch - angle diffusion of electrons into the loss - cone and their subsequent precipitation into the atmosphere , by characterizing their loss from the system by an escape time @xmath14 .",
    "the kinetic or fokker - planck equation describing the evolution in time @xmath15 of the electron energy distribution function @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17-    { f\\over t_{esc } } + s(e , t ) ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the particle kinetic energy in units of the rest mass energy , @xmath19 is the lorentz factor , @xmath20 is the particle speed , @xmath21 is the electron rest mass , and c is the speed of light ; @xmath22 is the number of particles per unit volume in the interval @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the energy diffusion coefficient due to resonant interaction of the electrons with whistler - mode turbulence ; @xmath25 is the systematic acceleration rate due to the whistler - mode turbulence ; @xmath26 is the energy loss rate due to processes not directly related to stochastic acceleration , namely , here assumed to be coulomb collisions and synchrotron radiation ; @xmath14 is the mean escape time of particles out of the system due to pitch - angle scattering by both whistler - mode and emic waves ; and the source term @xmath27 represents the rate of particle injection into the inner magnetospheric region specified in figure  [ fig1 ] , as a result of storm activity .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is not the standard form of fokker - planck equation employed in space physics , and so we give a brief account of its derivation in the appendix .",
    "detailed data on the whistler - mode chorus during storm - time are unfortunately not available .",
    "in fact , insufficient information is known about the energy spectrum of the turbulence in many space physics situations . while whistler - mode chorus emissions are normally considered to be discrete during geomagnetically quiet times @xcite ,",
    "it is here assumed that during geomagnetic storms the concomitant , enhanced whistler - mode turbulence can be considered quasi - continuous .",
    "specifically , a simplifying assumption is made that the whistler - mode turbulence is isotropic , homogeneous , stationary , and has a power - law spectral energy density distribution in wavenumber @xmath28 , with spectral index @xmath29 ; specifically , the spectral energy density is assumed to take the form , @xmath30 for wavenumbers greater than @xmath31 , to be specified below . in accordance with the quasi - linear diffusion formulation adopted in this paper ,",
    "the whistler - mode turbulence is weak , i.e. , comprises small - amplitude magnetic and electric wave fields .",

    "we relate @xmath137 to the time taken after the initiation of a storm for fluxes of relativistic electrons to peak ( see section 1 ) , which is observed to be several days .",
    "thus , we favour solutions of the present model for which @xmath138 1  5 days , with @xmath136 days possibly the optimal value .    in figure [ fig6 ] and table 3",
    "we show the corresponding results for the case @xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 pt , while in figure [ fig7 ] and table 4 we show the results for the case @xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 nt . as can be seen from the tables , for both these cases best agreement between the solutions and the  hard",
    "\" electron distribution of _ cayton et al . _ [ 1989 ] occurs when @xmath135 day , and corresponds to a formation time @xmath138 3  5 days . if the background number density is taken to be @xmath4 @xmath3 , the cases shown in figures 6 and 7 correspond respectively to values for the wave amplitude @xmath50 of 190 pt and 316 pt .",
    "figures 6 and 7 correspond to cases of intense substorm activity during the storm recovery phase .",
    "taking into account the value of the wave amplitudes given in table 2 corresponding to @xmath2 @xmath3 , and their converted values for the case @xmath4 @xmath3 , we re - iterate that the model solutions imply in particular that for a kolmogorov turbulent wave spectrum , sustained whistler amplitudes in the physically realistic range 13  72 pt can generate a typical high energy  hard \" electron distribution in the inner magnetosphere @xmath145 within one or two days .",
    "it should also be noted that the model calculations show that the acceleration mechanism considered in this paper is not effective in the region @xmath146 since the necessary values of the whistler amplitude would be too high ( typically in excess of 1 nt ) .",
    "thus , the model formulated herein has been shown to be a viable mechanism for accelerating electrons exactly in the inner region of the magnetosphere where the peak in electron phase space density of the highly energetic electrons is observed to occur [ e.g. , _ selesnick and blake _ , 1997b ] .    a requirement of the model presented here",
    "is enhanced whistler - mode chorus lasting for a period of at least one or two days .",
    "geomagnetic conditions during which such a requirement is particularly well satisfied occur during the descending phase of the solar cycle when the earth s magnetosphere can be impacted by a high - speed solar wind stream following a magnetic field build - up known as a corotating interaction region ( cir ) .",
    "cirs cause small and moderate magnetic storms , but not major storms . since the earth can be embedded in the associated high - speed stream for days to weeks there are substorms for days to weeks [ _ tsurutani et al . _ , 1995 ; _ kamide et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ] .",
    "thus , during this long - lasting recovery phase of the magnetic storm , there will be continuously enhanced wave activity , in the form of both whistler - mode chorus and emic waves , to drive the acceleration mechanism presented herein to generate the high energy ( @xmath51 mev ) electrons .",
    "in this paper , by means of quasi - linear theory and a test - particle approach , we have formulated the model kinetic equation ( 1 ) in which the acceleration mechanism is due to gyroresonant interaction between electrons and whistler - mode turbulence , corresponding to parallel wave propagation .",
    "the essential purpose of the study has been to apply equation ( 1 ) to the earth s inner magnetosphere in order to test the hypothesis that storm - enhanced whistler - mode chorus can accelerate lower - energy substorm - produced seed electrons to relativistic ( @xmath0 mev ) energies over a period of a few days .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "based on the model calculations in this paper , it is entirely possible for enhanced whistler - mode chorus to generate the observed increases in relativistic ( @xmath5 1 mev )  killer \" electrons during the storm recovery after a period of several days , so long as the waves are sufficiently strong .",
    "if @xmath2 @xmath3 is taken to be the background plasma number density outside the plasmasphere , the typical average wave - amplitudes required for a kolmogorov spectrum are in the range @xmath84  400 pt , dependent on the location @xmath83 . if @xmath4 @xmath3 , the required wave - amplitudes are in range 13 - 72 pt .",
    "energetic electron spectra of the model solutions do not follow a simple power law in energy . for certain sets of parameters",
    ", we find that solutions can be well fitted to the relativistic maxwellian distribution empirically constructed by _",
    "cayton et al . _",
    "[ 1989 ] to represent the higher energy ( 300 kev  2 mev )  hard \" electron population at geosynchronous orbit .",
    "we note the recent analysis by _",
    "freeman et al . _",
    "[ 1998 ] of the november 3  4 , 1993 storm , in which electrons from about 100 kev to 1.5 mev were characterized by a power law spectrum .",
    "evidently , optimal fitting of empirical electron spectra to power - law , maxwellian , or other types of distribution can depend on the energy range prescribed and the event under consideration .",
    "in connection with electron power - law energy spectra , _ ma and summers _ [ 1998 ] have shown that such spectra can be produced by whistler - mode turbulence , although it is questionable whether the necessary conditions established in their theoretical study can be satisfied in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "it is unlikely that any single physical mechanism of electron acceleration can fully account for relativistic electron enhancements occurring during the recovery phase of magnetic storms , not least because various types of energetic electron event have been observed [ e.g. , _ baker et al .",
    "_ , 1997 , 1998 ; _ reeves _ , 1998b",
    "; _ reeves et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ] .",
    "rapid energetic electron flux enhancements taking place over minutes have been associated with inductive electric fields [ e.g. , _ li et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ] , while enhancements occurring over tens of minutes or a few hours have been linked to ulf pulsations [ e.g. , _ rostoker et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; _ liu et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ] . the gradual acceleration process ( occurring over a few days ) formulated in this paper is not intended to apply to such energetic electron events which typically result from major storms",
    ". however , small and moderate magnetic storms associated with corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) characteristically have long recovery phases and attendant substorms for days to weeks [ _ tsurutani et al . _ , 1995 ; _ kamide et al . _ ,",
    "since these substorms produce enhanced whistler - mode chorus ( and emic waves ) over ( at least ) several days , the necessary conditions for the effectiveness of the mechanism presented in this paper are satisfied .",
    "hence , for these types of storm , and possibly others , when average wave - amplitudes are sufficiently large , the present study shows that , in conjunction with pitch - angle scattering by emic waves , the mechanism of stochastic acceleration by whistler - mode turbulence is a serious candidate for explaining the generation of  killer electrons \" .",
    "we consider energetic charged particles in a uniform magnetic field , with superimposed small - amplitude plasma waves of a given mode .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the particle distribution function @xmath147 due to gyroresonant interactions with the waves is @xmath148 equation ( [ a1 ] ) , called a kinetic or diffusion or fokker - planck equation , is derived by expanding a collisionless boltzmann equation for the particle distribution function to second order in perturbed quantities , and ensemble - averaging over the statistical properties of the plasma waves in accordance with quasi - linear theory . among the early authors to carry out this procedure were _ kennel and engelmann _ [ 1966 ] , _ hall and sturrock _ [ 1967 ] , and _ lerche _ [ 1968 ] ; see also _ melrose _ [ 1980 ] , _ schlickeiser _ [ 1989 ] , and _ steinacker and miller _ [ 1992 ] , and references therein . in ( [ a1 ] ) , @xmath149 is the relativistic unit momentum given by @xmath150 , where @xmath20 is the particle speed , and @xmath19 is the lorentz factor , with @xmath90 the speed of light ; @xmath15 is time ; @xmath100 is the cosine of the pitch angle ; @xmath151 is an energy loss term due to processes not directly associated with gyro - resonant wave - particle interactions ; and @xmath152 is a source term .",
    "the fokker - planck or diffusion coefficients @xmath153 , and @xmath154 depend on the properties of the wave turbulence , viz .",
    ", the wave mode and polarization , the angle of wave propagation to the ambient magnetic field , and the power spectrum , including the ratio of the turbulent wave energy to the background magnetic energy .",
    "these coefficients have been given both in general form , and specific form , for various particular wave modes , by a number of authors , e.g. , _ melrose _ [ 1980 ] , _ schlickeiser _ [ 1989 ] , _ steinacker and miller _ [ 1992 ] , and _ hamilton and petrosian _ [ 1992 ] .",
    "it is not necessary here to derive equation ( [ a1 ] ) , which requires considerable algebra , or to provide general expressions for the coefficients @xmath155 , and @xmath154 .",
    "we shall assume that the rate of pitch - angle scattering is much larger than the rate of energy diffusion ( and the rate of the particle escape from the system ) .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable based on an analysis of time scales associated with resonant interaction of electrons with whistler - mode waves , e.g. , see _ melrose _ [ 1980 ] and the discussion by _ hamilton and petrosian _ [ 1992 ] .",
    "equivalently , defining the time scales @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and the escape time @xmath14 , we assume that @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "then the particle distribution function can be assumed to be isotropic , and the pitch angle can be eliminated from the problem by integrating ( [ a1 ] ) with respect to @xmath100 [ e.g. , see _ schlickeiser _ , 1989 ; _ steinacker and miller _ , 1992 ] .",
    "writing @xmath162 and representing the scattering loss of particles by pitch angle diffusion by means of a loss term @xmath163 , the equation ( [ a1 ] ) thus becomes @xmath164 where the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath165 has been formed by averaging with respect to @xmath100 .",
    "we now change the momentum variable @xmath149 to the kinetic energy variable @xmath166 in equation ( [ a3 ] ) .",
