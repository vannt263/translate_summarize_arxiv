    "photons are among the main candidate systems for the implementation of quantum information processing .",
    "one potential avenue in this context is to implement quantum gates between individual photonic qubits .",
    "although there has been considerable experimental progress in realizing photonic pulse cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) in recent years @xcite , this is still an extremely challenging goal , because the interaction between single photons in nonlinear media is generally weak .",
    "an alternative attractive approach involves the interaction of individual photons with intense coherent states .",
    "this approach can be used for the implementation of nondemolition measurements of the photon number @xcite .",
    "it also forms the basis for quantum gate proposals between individual photons that use the coherent state as an auxiliary system @xcite . for all of these applications ,",
    "given an idealized single - mode coherent state @xmath0 and a single photon state @xmath1 , one aims to perform the transformation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 can be small .",
    "it was first proposed in @xcite that a deterministic parity gate for single - photon qubits could be realized by such weak nonlinearity .",
    "this idea has been widely employed in the researches on physical realization of quantum communication and quantum computing , see , e.g. , @xcite for recent studies .",
    "most of the previous studies adopt a single mode assumption for xpm . under this assumption the interaction term for the photonic states is given as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the mode of single photon and coherent state , respectively , and @xmath7 is the interaction strength ( @xmath8 is used throughout this paper ) .",
    "this actually models an ideal xpm mentioned above as the coupling of two harmonic oscillators , one of which is in the state @xmath9 and the other is in the state @xmath10 , through the interaction described by the nonlinear term @xmath11 .",
    "this type of single - mode description is highly idealized . in reality , even if the light pulses start out as single - mode , interactions will generically create continuous - mode entanglement .",
    "this has been analyzed for photon - photon gates , studying both the longitudinal @xcite and , more recently , the transverse @xcite degrees of freedom .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no such study has been made for the equally important case of single photons interacting with coherent states .",
    "here we develop an effective quantum field theory description of the xpm between continuous - mode photonic pulses .",
    "the photonic degrees of freedom are described by quantum fields over the whole space that interact with each other through a general potential @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction is thus treated as instantaneous , which corresponds to an adiabatic elimination of the degrees of freedom of the nonlinear medium .",
    "this approximation is well established for nonlinearities based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to describe interactions between rydberg polaritons @xcite , and photonic nonlinearities due to collisions in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "we will furthermore focus on very short - range interactions , which are typically modeled by the contact potential @xmath13 . for a discussion of non - instantaneous effects see ref .",

    "v we apply the developed formalism to several relevant cases . in particular in sec .",
    "v.a we study the case of two interacting single photons , introducing the concepts of fidelity and conditional phase . in sec .",
    "v.b we treat the case of a coherent state interacting with a single photon , adapting the aforementioned concepts . in sec .",
    "vi we study the performance of cross - kerr nonlinearity based on pulses interacting through contact potential .",
    "in particular , we discuss the the different types of xpm with pulse of unequal and equal group velocities .",
    "finally in section vii we give our conclusions .",
    "we first clarify the quantum states for the realistic pulses .",

    "we here adopt a systematic way to express the states of photonic pulses in terms of the polarization components of a slowly varying field @xmath33 .",
    "for any field sharply peaked around a certain frequency , the slowly varying frequency @xmath34 in the square - root factor of ( [ quant ] ) can be regarded as constant @xcite .",

    "to completely understand the xpm between photonic pulses , it is necessary to find the output state of the pulses from the initial product state , e.g. , @xmath44 .",

    "the entanglement between the modes @xmath21 and @xmath114 in a realistic output , as well as the inhomogeneity in pulse interaction , will generally impair such ideal performance for a quantum phase gate .",
    "another interesting observation is the existence of the self - phase modulation ( spm ) effect in a more general situation with the factor in eq .",

    "given the @xmath136 determined from pulse interaction of arbitrary intensity ( the nonlinearity due to xpm may not be weak ) , there exists a @xmath3 ( up to the modulo of @xmath137 ) such that the fidelity @xmath138 is the maximum .",
    "we define this @xmath3 , which corresponds to the ideal output state @xmath139 that is closest to the actual output state , as the conditional phase of the xpm process .",
    "in this section we study the performance of the xpm between a continuous - mode coherent state and a continuous - mode single photon . in most applications",
    "only a small conditional phase @xmath3 is necessary for a cross - kerr nonlinearity between a coherent and single photon state .",
    "a suitable weak cross - kerr nonlinearity is the core element for realizing all setups proposed in @xcite .",
    "our approach based on the general fidelity function in eq .",
    "( [ fidelity - c - s ] ) , however , applies to strong nonlinearity as well .    to begin with",
    ", we will only consider the longitudinal degrees of freedom , assuming that the transverse degrees of freedom are well decoupled from the relevant dynamics by properly confining the pulses in the transverse direction .",
    "such one - dimensional ( 1-d ) treatment of xpm can be found in , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the pulse interaction potential in these references is given as the 1-d contact potential @xmath140 .",
    "then the fidelity function given in eq .",
    "( [ fidelity - c - s ] ) will be reduced to @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath143 . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the phase function @xmath145 is constant and equal to @xmath146 provided that @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( the integral with respect to @xmath149 should be across the point @xmath150 where the delta function is non - zero ) for all relevant values of @xmath50 and @xmath151 , i.e. for all values for which @xmath152 and @xmath153 are significantly different from zero . in the case of @xmath154 ,",
    "the condition for the constant @xmath155 becomes @xmath156 and @xmath157 instead .",
    "such conditions mean that the two wave packets have to be initially well separated , then one has to pass through the other , and they have to be well separated again in the final state . under these conditions",
    "one can simply replace @xmath145 by @xmath146 in eq .",
    "( [ unequal ] ) .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath158 .",
    "the conditional phase @xmath3 is therefore equal to @xmath146 in this case , and the usual single - mode description is appropriate .",
    "see fig . 1 for an illustration of this regime with a specific example .",
    "[ ]    the unit fidelity of the xpm is possible only if one pulse completely passes through the other .",
    "the result is in consistency with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the head - on collision or different group velocities of the pulses are proposed to realize a homogeneous phase .",
    "perfect fidelity is possible in principle even for large photon numbers , which is encouraging for potential applications @xcite .",
    "[ ]    the situation is quite different for co - propagating pulses , i.e. for @xmath159 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath160 the factor @xmath161 is non - zero only for @xmath162 , and it appears in the argument of a cosine function , whose modulus is bounded by 1 .",
    "therefore it has no effect on the integral over @xmath50 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath138 assumes its maximum value of 1 for @xmath163 , see fig . 2 for an illustration by a specific example .",
    "as a consequence , the closest ideal output state to the real output state is found to be same as the input state , so the conditional phase @xmath3 for this type of xpm is zero .",
    "intuitively this can be understood as follows .",
    "the phase shift of the coherent state is due to a single photon .",
    "if this photon is detected at a certain position @xmath50 , then the phase of the coherent state will be shifted exactly at that position ( i.e. at a single point ) , but nowhere else .",
    "this has a negligible effect when determining the overall phase shift .    of course",
    ", the exact delta potential is only an idealized model . a more realistic model for contact interaction may have very short but non - zero interaction range",
    ". then it will be possible to obtain a small , but non - zero , conditional phase @xmath3 for the xpm between two co - propagating pulses .",
    "but it is clear that co - propagation is not an attractive regime in the present context .",
    "so far in this section we have only considered the longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "however , eq . ( [ fidelity - c - s ] ) makes it possible to analyze the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom as well , cf .",
    "for simplicity , let us only consider contact interactions , i.e. @xmath164 .",
    "let us also assume that the pulses pass through each other as discussed above . under these conditions @xmath165 , where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the transverse components of @xmath168 and @xmath116 .",
    "the situation is then fully analogous to our above discussion of eq .",
    "( [ equal ] ) , where the phase function was also a delta function , and the conditional phase @xmath3 is again zero .",
    "this simple result holds in the limit where the medium length is much shorter than the rayleigh length , cf .",
    "the discussion for photon - photon gates in ref .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of using strong focusing , confinement @xcite , or other methods @xcite to suppress these unwanted transverse effects .",
    "we have developed a general formalism for the continuous - mode treatment of photonic pulse interactions and applied it to the case of the interaction of a coherent state with a single photon , which is highly relevant for applications in quantum information processing .",
    "we introduced the concepts of fidelity and conditional phase in order to quantify the validity of the usual single - mode approximations .",
    "we found that high fidelities , non - zero conditional phases and high photon numbers ( as required for most applications ) are compatible in the xpm between two pulses with unequal group velocities , provided that the pulses fully pass through each other . on the other hand , using two exactly co - propagating pulses can hardly generate a non - zero conditional phase .",
    "our results obtained with the general formalism also apply to the regime beyond weak nonlinearity , which is widely considered in the applications .",
    "we believe that our work constitutes significant progress in making the treatment of coherent state - single photon interactions more realistic .",
    "there are nevertheless several points where the theory could still be made more realistic , including the inclusion of loss ( non - unitary dynamics ) , non - instantaneous interactions ( and the associated noise ) , and the effect of the forces due to the interaction on the motion of the pulses .",

    "<S> weak cross - kerr nonlinearities between single photons and coherent states are the basis for many applications in quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> these nonlinearities have so far mainly been discussed in terms of highly idealized single - mode models . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a general theory of the interaction between continuous - mode photonic pulses and apply it to the case of a single photon interacting with a coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively study the validity of the usual single - mode approximation using the concepts of fidelity and conditional phase . </S>",
    "<S> we show that high fidelities , non - zero conditional phases and high photon numbers are compatible , under conditions where the pulses fully pass through each other and where unwanted transverse - mode effects are suppressed . </S>"
