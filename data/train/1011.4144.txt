    "however , an explicit realization of such an instability in superstring theory has been missing . for example",
    ", the chern - simons coupling of the minimal gauged supergravity in 5 dimensions is @xmath3 which is slightly lower than the critical value @xmath4 for the instability of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite .",
    "similarly , the three - charge extremal black hole in the type iib superstring theory on @xmath5 is found to be barely stable .    in this paper , we show that such an instability is realized in the quark - gluon plasma phase of the sakai - sugimoto model for qcd with @xmath6 flavors of massless quarks @xcite . on the worldvolume of the 8-branes ,",
    "there is a @xmath7 gauge field , and its diagonal @xmath8 part is dual to the quark number ( @xmath9 times the baryon number ) .",
    "the baryons are identified with instanton solutions on the worldvolume in this model @xcite .",
    "worldvolume solutions representing qcd states with finite baryon density and temperature have been studied @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for related papers .",
    "most of the solutions with finite baryon density are singular at the sources of baryons charges , and it is not clear whether the supergravity approximation is applicable .",
    "one of the exceptional cases is the quark - gluon plasma phase , where there is a smooth solution representing a finite baryon density configuration .    in the sakai - sugimoto model ,",
    "the gluon degrees of freedom are realized on @xmath10 d4 branes compactified on a circle @xmath11 with supersymmetry breaking boundary condition @xcite . at finite temperature , we compactify the euclidean time on another circle @xmath12 , and the d4 brane world volume has the topology of @xmath13 . in the confinement phase , @xmath11 is contractible in the bulk , and the topology of the bulk geometry is then @xmath14 times a disk bounded by @xmath11 .",

    "it is possible to construct a solution with finite baryon density that is smooth everywhere on the worldvolume , as we will discuss below . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on this case .",
    "the dynamics of the 8-brane worldvolume is described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action with the chern - simons term .",
    "we show that there is a critical baryon density above which the brane configuration becomes unstable by tachyonic modes carrying non - zero momenta .",
    "to understand the nature of the phase transition , we construct a solution to the full non - linear equations .",
    "though the solution carries non - zero momentum , its energy is lower than that of the original configuration which is spatially homogeneous .",

    "a holographic dual of a baryon density wave was discussed in a phenomenological model in @xcite .",
    "the instability of the sakai - sugimoto model has been studied earlier , for example in @xcite , but not in the chiral symmetric phase .",
    "to our knowledge , it has not been shown whether the chern - simons coupling on the worldvolume theory on the 8-branes is large enough to trigger the spatially modulated phase transition . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the chern - simons coupling is 3 times the critical value required for the instability .",

    "if the kinetic term for the gauge field were of the maxwell form @xmath49 , the electric field strength could be made arbitrarily high by raising the baryon density , and any non - zero value of the chern - simons coupling would induce an instability of the type discovered in @xcite . with the dbi action , there is an upper bound for the field strength , and it requires a more careful analysis to determine whether the instability takes place .",
    "let us consider a background configuration with non - zero @xmath50 .",

    "note that @xmath56 gives @xmath57 .",
    "we choose the gauge potential @xmath58 so that it vanishes on the horizon .",
    "since the chemical potential @xmath59 is given by the asymptotic value of @xmath60 at @xmath61 , we have @xmath62       as a function of the chern - simons coupling @xmath44.,width=264 ]    we solved the linearized equation ( [ ode ] ) numerically for general values of the chern - simons coupling @xmath44 .",

    "the chern - simons coupling on the worldvolume theory is @xmath91 and is above the limiting value of @xmath92 . at this value of @xmath44 ,",
    "the critical quark density is numerically evaluated as @xmath93    let us express the critical quark density in the original set of variables .",
    "the quark density @xmath54 is defined by a variation of the lagrangian density with respect to @xmath94 . in the above",
    ", we rescale the action by the factor @xmath46 given by ( [ factorc ] ) and the gauge field is rescaled as @xmath95",
    ". we should also remember that we rescaled our spacetime coordinates by @xmath96 .",
    "the physical quark density @xmath54 is then related to @xmath53 discussed in the above as @xmath97 substituting ( [ criticaltilded ] ) into this , the critical quark density at @xmath91 is given as @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to make sure that we can ignore backreaction of this quark density to the bulk geometry .",
    "one way to see this is to note that the critical baryon density is given by dividing the quark density @xmath100 by @xmath10 .",
    "the result is proportional to @xmath101 , but it does not have any power of @xmath10 . since the baryons can be thought of as d4 branes wrapping @xmath20 @xcite , their backreaction becomes significant only when their density scales as @xmath10 or more .",
    "thus , the backreaction is negligible provided @xmath102 .",
    "another way to see this is to evaluate the energy density due to the electric field using the action ( [ e : actionwithoutr ] ) and show that it is proportional to @xmath103 times some power of @xmath104 .",
    "this is the same scaling behavior as the tension of the @xmath6 8-branes .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to express the critical density in terms of qcd quantities .",
    "the string parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 are related to the yang - mills coupling @xmath107 and the kaluza - klein scale @xmath108 for the compactification circle @xmath17 as @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the circumference of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the critical baryon density can then be written as , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "the constants @xmath108 and @xmath114 can be determined by fitting , for example , with the pion decay constant and the mass of the @xmath54-meson , as @xmath115 949 mev and @xmath116 16.6 @xcite .",
    "the deconfinement temperature , where the thermal cycle @xmath12 becomes contractible , is at @xmath117 151 mev .",
    "interestingly , this turns out to be close the critical temperature expected for the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "if we substitute @xmath118 mev in ( [ criticaldensity ] ) , for example , the critical baryon density comes out as , @xmath119 for @xmath120 , this is about 10 times the nucleon density in atomic nuclei .",
    "the equation ( [ e : nonlinearfinalequation ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "figure [ fig : h0ksample ] shows the range of momenta where non - linear static solutions exist for a sample case of @xmath127 .",
    "the vertical axis @xmath128 is an initial value of @xmath129 : @xmath130 .",

    "note that the free energy @xmath131 is a function of @xmath54 , and not @xmath134 .",
    "we have identified the momentum with the lowest value of the free energy , and the expectation value of the current operator @xmath135 dual to @xmath129 can be read off from the asymptotic behavior of the normalizable solutions .",

    "there are separate gauge fields @xmath149 and @xmath150 on the d8 and @xmath18 branes , respectively , and they cause the instability above the critical charge density .",
