    "( 2010 ) or presented here , we find @xmath32 . we set 13% as a floor on the measured uncertainty .",
    "aperture corrections are a significant source of systematic uncertainty . in ellipticals ,",
    "@xmath4  is typically measured within a fixed fraction of @xmath33 , which is challenging to measure in spiral bulges .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4  profiles are more complex and @xmath34 is typically higher in spiral bulges , even when the large - scale disk is excluded , as here ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not correct @xmath4  for rotation , but we estimate the magnitude of such a correction as follows .",
    "typical spirals have @xmath35 within 1 - 2  @xcite . removing the rotation in quadrature",
    "moves the spirals toward the @xmath36  relation of ellipticals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , elliptical galaxies also typically rotate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so there is no strong scientific justification to remove this component of dynamical support only in the spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition to @xmath4 , we calculate stellar masses ( @xmath37 ) for the 67 galaxies that lie within the sdss footprint using linear relationships between color and @xmath38 from @xcite . to estimate an allowed range of @xmath37 , for each galaxy we calculate 12 possible stellar masses using the four sdss petrosian colors to derive @xmath38 , combined with the robustly measured @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41band luminosities .",
    "we average these estimates and take the standard deviation to estimate an error  this error is larger in systems with a wide mix of stellar populations and/or dust , where blue and red colors provide quite different @xmath38 estimates",
    ".    we calculate @xmath37 for the entire galaxy and within @xmath42  kpc ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the mass within a fixed physical aperture is a crude but non - parametric estimate of the central stellar density , and might correlate better with @xmath2  than the total @xmath37 .",
    "it is also a simple measurement relative to @xmath44 , @xmath4 , or even @xmath45 .",
    "we measure @xmath43 from the sdss data using the luminosity within a central circular aperture .",
    "we exclude galaxies where the aperture is @xmath462  , which are limited by the sdss seeing .",
    "photometric stellar masses contain many uncertainties , including aperture effects , projection effects , and the contribution of nebular emission from an active nucleus ( for the megamaser disk galaxies ) .",
    "the latter effect we mitigate by taking an average over multiple filters .",
    "we find only small differences when we test elliptical apertures for a subset of the galaxies ( @xmath47 mag ) , and removing edge - on galaxies does not change the result .",
    "we also explore whether our results are biased by using projected quantities . for the high - mass , high - srsic  index galaxies , we analytically deproject the central mass @xcite using the single - srsic  fits from the nsa catalog .",
    "we reproduce our aperture measurements within 0.1 dex , with no systematic dependence on mass or @xmath48 .",
    "deprojection uncertainties may play a larger role for the pseudobulges , particularly for nearly edge - on inclinations .",
    "we explore the importance of the inclination using ellipse fitting to our _ hst _  data for the maser galaxies @xcite and find that the differences between circular and elliptical apertures are never larger than 0.2 mag , translating into @xmath49 dex in stellar mass .",
    "hardest to quantify are the errors incurred from our mass estimation techniques , but overall it has been shown that single - color conversions (  3.3 ) return an unbiased stellar mass @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig : bhcent]a , we show the relationship between @xmath2  and @xmath37 .",
    "we fit all relations in this paper using the bayesian line - fitting code of @xcite , taking into account uncertainties in both @xmath2  and the galaxy properties .",
    "we fit a log - linear model with log ( @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being @xmath37 , @xmath43 , or @xmath4  and @xmath52 near the center of the distribution ( table 2 ) .    we find @xmath53 dex scatter in the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath2 . at a stellar mass of @xmath54  @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath2  spans a range from @xmath55 to @xmath56  @xmath1 , and spiral galaxies tend to have lower @xmath2  than elliptical galaxies at similar @xmath37 .",
    "we have long known that bhs correlate better with galaxy bulges than with @xmath37 , disk mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or asymptotic circular velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "original interpretations of the bh - bulge scaling relations posited that energy released during active phases of bh growth acted on galaxy - wide gas reservoirs , thus impacting the future growth of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bhs in the megamaser disk galaxies are too large to be primordial seeds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so they have certainly undergone some accretion episodes , but the lack of correlation with @xmath37 strongly suggests that bh growth does not remove gas from galactic disks ( i.e. , does not act beyond bulge scales ) . after removing the disk component , we still see considerable scatter between @xmath2  and bulge properties in late - type spiral galaxies , even when we attempt to isolate the `` classical '' bulge component from the nuclear disks , rings , and bars that characterize `` pseudobulges '' @xcite .",
    "recent work has found that central mass density ( stellar mass within 1 kpc , @xmath43 ) is a strong indicator of the star formation history of a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with high central stellar density and galaxy quenching going hand in hand .",
    "exactly what terminates star formation in dense galaxies remains unknown , but one possibility is feedback from supermassive bhs , which may grow along with dense cores .",
    "thus , we consider a local relationship between @xmath2  and the mass enclosed within 1 kpc ( figure [ fig : bhcent]b ) .    a local relationship between @xmath2  and stellar mass is cheap to measure (  3.3 ) and relatively easy to compare with simulations ( see * ? ?",
    "such a local relationship might arise if the gas supply to the galaxy center determines both the central star formation rate and the overall rate of bh growth , and bh growth is self - regulated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or if the accretion disk is fed locally by stars rather than gas accretion @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath43 relation is shown in figure [ fig : bhcent]b .",
    "we do observe an overall correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the scatter is substantial ( 0.8 dex ; table 2 ) , and the dynamic range in @xmath43 is limited , causing a very steep scaling between @xmath43 and @xmath2 . at the highest masses , core scouring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tends to artificially decrease the central mass density .",
    "we `` correct '' the most massive galaxies for core scouring in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhcent]b by adding the @xmath2  to the central mass , but our fits do not change .      turning to the @xmath2-@xmath4  relation ,",
    "our linear fit to the full sample of galaxies confirms the steep slope found in recent works ( @xmath57 ) and the high intrinsic scatter ( @xmath58 ) . in @xcite",
    ", we found that the bh masses in the megamaser disk galaxies are lower than expected at a fixed @xmath4 .",
    "here we double the megamaser disk sample and strongly confirm our previous result ( fig .",
    "[ fig : msigma ] ) .",
    "we calculate the average offset @xmath59 between @xmath2  and that predicted by the @xmath36  relation fit to early - type galaxies .",
    "the offset is calculated as the weighted mean of the difference between the measured @xmath2  and that calculated from the best - fit relation , with the weights including both @xmath60 and @xmath61 uncertainties combined in quadrature @xcite .",
    "we find an offset of @xmath62 for late - type galaxies and an offset of @xmath63 for pseudobulges .",
    "we now have marginally sufficient statistics to compare the distributions of maser and non - maser spirals .",
    "there are 20 megamaser disk galaxies ( 2 s0 , 18 spiral ) and 17 late - type ( non - s0 ) spiral galaxies with @xmath2  measurements from non - maser dynamics .",
    "the maser and non - maser samples have indistinguishable distributions in @xmath4  according to an anderson - darling test ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with @xmath64 of being drawn from the same distribution . likewise , the distributions of bulge type are quite similar , with @xmath65% of the stellar / gas dynamical and @xmath66% of the megamaser disk galaxies hosted by pseudobulges ( table 1 ) .",
    "-2 mm calculating the net offset from our best - fit @xmath2-@xmath4  relation for elliptical galaxies , we find @xmath67 dex for the 20 megamaser disks , while we find no mean offset @xmath68 dex for the non - maser spirals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mhist ] ) .",
    "the maser and non - maser spirals are significantly different in @xmath69 ; the anderson - darling test returns a probability @xmath70 that they are drawn from the same distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mhist ] ) , even if we focus on just the 18 non - s0 maser disk galaxies or the maser and non - maser pseudobulge samples ( @xmath71 ) . finally , we examine the two samples non - parametrically in two dimensions using the cramer von - mises test , and find that the two samples are different at 90% significance .    with such small numbers we see only a suggestive difference between the maser and non - maser samples . on the other hand",
    ", we see a similar trend in the @xmath2-@xmath72 relations @xcite .",
    "thus , we briefly consider the possible ramifications should this difference prove real .",
    "there are three possibilities .",
    "first , the masers could trace the true @xmath2  distribution , while the non - maser @xmath2  distribution is biased due to the inability to resolve the sphere of influence of @xmath73  @xmath1  bhs .",
    "existing upper limits do not constrain this possibility , as they are at higher bh mass @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "spiral ( or low - mass ) galaxies do have a broad range of @xmath2 , as may be expected in merger - driven scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or if @xmath2  never gets large enough to exert feedback on the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the non - maser distribution could be the real one , with masers preferentially occurring in lower-@xmath2  systems due to a correlation between @xmath2  and disk size @xcite .",
    "the third possibility , which we view as highly unlikely , is that we may be preferentially catching the maser galaxies as they grow toward the @xmath2-@xmath4  relation .",
    "given that bh growth episodes are likely quite short compared to the growth times of bulges ( many gyr ) , we do not favor this third scenario @xcite .",
    "we urgently need more observations of both spiral and elliptical galaxies at low mass , using multiple methods , to determine the full distribution of @xmath2  at low galaxy mass .",
    "we present new stellar velocity dispersion measurements for seven megamaser disk galaxies , and revisit galaxy - bh scaling relations that incorporate these new measurements .",
    "in addition to @xmath4 , we investigate total stellar mass @xmath37 , and a non - parametric measure of central stellar mass density within 1 kpc , @xmath43 .",
    "we have also recently examined bulge mass @xcite , and halo mass @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2  in megamaser disk galaxies span a large range for any fixed galaxy property , while the maser and non - maser dynamical measurements have different distributions of @xmath2  at a fixed galaxy property . to determine the real distribution of @xmath2  in this low - mass regime we must push the sphere - of - influence limit downwards for non - maser @xmath2 .",
    "we hope that with alma ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and thirty - meter",
    " class optical / nir telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will fill in low - mass galaxies with non - maser dynamical measurements to address the full distribution of @xmath2  in low - mass galaxies .",
