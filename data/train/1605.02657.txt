    "polarization of the ysr band increases upon decreasing transparency ( @xmath172 for @xmath173 ) .",
    "another important feature is that the relative shift of spin - resolved conductances , induced by the collective magnetic field of the impurities , enables a very high degree of current spin - polarization for the bias window close to the zeeman - split gap edges . in particular , for the case of ferromagnetic exchange between the impurity spins and the itinerant electrons ( @xmath165 ) , there is a possibility to choose the electric current spin - polarization by simply tuning the bias around @xmath174 , see red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ conductance_mso1_tunnel](c ) .",
    "this feature makes such systems potentially suitable for on - demand production of quasiparticles with specific spin projection .",
    "so far , we have discussed only the spin polarization of electric current . in the tunneling regime",
    ", one can get an insight into the nature of elementary charge carriers and their statistics by looking at current fluctuations @xcite .",
    "namely , let us consider the differential fano factor , as a measure of the carrier effective charge ( in units of @xmath90 ) . in the normal ( non - superconducting ) state we have @xmath175 , indicating that the electric current is transfered by quasiparticles with the effective charge equal to @xmath90 , see ref .",
    "[ ] . in superconductors , besides the single - particle tunneling , we also have andreev reflection processes @xcite , which imply a transfer of charge equal @xmath176 .",
    "so , the value of @xmath150 helps to decipher the relative role of single - particle and andreev refection processes in the tunneling current .    in fig .",
    "[ fano_tunnel ] we plot the differential fano factor for our setup .",
    "we observe that for all voltages above the gap @xmath175 , indicating the dominant role of single - particle tunneling . at voltages below the gap we have @xmath177 for all energies except for those corresponding to the ysr impurity band , where we recover @xmath178 again .",
    "this demonstrates , as expected , that andreev reflection is the dominant mechanism of sub - gap electric transport ( cooper pair tunneling ) , if there are no single - particle states in this bias window .",
    "however , a sub - gap metallic impurity band ( ysr band in our case ) , if present , predominantly supports single - particle tunneling .      in this section",
    "we investigate what happens to transport characteristics of the ns junction if we go beyond the tunneling limit .",
    "it is important to remind that we in this section assume a point contact between the superconductor and the normal - metal probe .",
    "it means that the contact area is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length , @xmath179 .",
    "this circumstance allows us to assume the order parameter to be approximately spatially independent @xcite .",
    "if we look at the ( charge ) conductance and differential noise , see fig .",
    "[ conductance_noise ] , we observe that there is no big difference between the cases of randomly oriented and ferromagnetically aligned impurity spins .",
    "the biggest noticeable difference is the zeeman splitting in the latter case . for a completely transparent interface , @xmath98 ,",
    "the sub - gap differential conductance is equal to twice the normal - state value , except for the bias window which covers the ysr impurity bands , see figs .",
    "[ fig_sc](a)-(b ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the probability of andreev reflection slightly reduces , but it still remains the dominant mechanism of sub - gap transport , compared to single - particle tunneling . decreasing the interface transparency , one observes a decrease of the sub - gap conductance , eventually recovering the tunneling regime discussed in the previous section .",
    "however , if we allow the transmission coefficient across the junction to be spin - dependent ( spin - filtering effect ) , @xmath180 , the conductance spectra look different , see fig .",
    "[ conductance_noise](c ) .",
    "the change is caused by the fact that andreev reflection in a spin - singlet superconductor requires quasiparticles of both spin flavors to have non - zero tunneling probability . in the extreme case , when one of the probablities vanishes , this process is forbidden .",
    "let us now discuss the current noise , see figs .",
    "[ conductance_noise](d)-(f ) .",
    "there are several sources of noise in a ns junction .",
    "apart from the usual thermal nyquist - johnson noise ( can be ignored at low temperatures ) , there is the shot noise , caused by fractional probabilities of single - particle tunneling and two - particle andreev reflection .",
    "the latter feature makes the noise reach its maximal value at the interface transparency @xmath181 ( @xmath182 above the gap ) , different from the normal - state value @xmath183 @xcite , see figs .",
    "[ conductance_noise](d)-(e ) .",

    "these states appear below the gap at energies @xmath188 , where upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to spin - up ( spin - down ) quasiparticles .    in fig .",
    "[ inv_prox](a ) we plot the spatial profile of the order parameter for different values of the interface transparency .",

    "[ dos_v_x](b ) one can see that the abs appears close to the gap edge and it repels the ysr bands away ( towards negative energies ) by smearing them out at the same time .",
    "the local density of states approaches its bulk form as we move away from the interface .",
    "finally , when the abs appears in between of the two ysr bands , the latter get repelled in opposite directions , see fig .",
    "[ dos_v_x](c ) .",
    "so far we have discussed the impact of abs on the ysr impurity bands . however , the shape of abs gets modified as well by the presence of both impurities and non - zero interface transparency .",
    "the broadening of low - energy abs due to impurities is known to range from @xmath190 in the born limit , to @xmath191 in the unitary limit @xcite .",
    "finite interface transparency also contributes to the abs broadening as @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "we have to note that the results plotted in fig .",
    "[ dos_v_x ] were obtained for spin - up quasiparticles , assuming that the magnetic impurities have randomly oriented spins .",
    "the corresponding plots for spin - down case look exactly the same , but mirrored with respect to @xmath97 . for the case of spin - polarized impurities",
    "no new features appear .",
    "the ysr bands get spin - polarized and shifted by the collective zeeman field of the impurities .",
    "let us now consider how the interplay between the ysr impurity bands and abs manifests itself in electric transport . in order to demonstrate it , we consider two regimes : ( 1 ) when broadening of the abs is governed by magnetic impurities , and ( 2 ) when it is dominated by the interface transparency . for simplicity",
    "we assume that impurities in the bulk of the superconductor have randomly oriented magnetic moments .    in case",
    "( 1 ) , when the abs width is controlled by magnetic impurities , we can still observe both the ysr impurity bands and the abs , see fig .",
    "[ transport](a ) . at the same time , one has to remember that the abs are spin - polarized and , as was discussed in the previous section , they repel the ysr bands for two spin - channels in the opposite direction , see fig .",
    "[ dos_v_x](b ) .",
    "it is remarkable that in this case , even though there are no spin currents possible in the bulk ( impurity spins are oriented randomly ) , close to the ns surface one can observe a non - zero spin conductance , see fig .  [ transport](b ) .",
    "moreover , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ transport](e ) , the sub - gap spin currents are highly polarized , with @xmath193 when @xmath136 .",
    "due to low transparency of the interface , sub - gap currents",
    "are mostly carried by single - particle excitations via the abs and ysr bands ( and cooper pairs in between them ) , see solid line in fig .",
    "[ transport](f ) , and possess negligible noise , see fig .",
    "[ transport](c ) .    for case",
    "( 2 ) , when broadening of the abs is governed by the interface transparency , tails of the abs completely mask the ysr impurity bands , see fig .  [",
    "transport](d ) , but the sub - gap structure can still be seen in the spin conductance , see fig .  [",
    "transport](b ) .",
    "increased transparency favors andreev reflection and drastically changes the statistics of sub - gap current carriers in the system , see fig .",
    "[ transport](f ) .",
    "indeed , above the gap we still observe @xmath194 ( except for the bcs coherence peak at the gap edge ) , characteristic of single - particle excitations , but the sub - gap transport is governed by two - particle ( andreev ) processes , in contrast to the tunneling case considered above , and @xmath195 . at voltages probing the abs ,",
    "the differential noise is much reduced compared to the charge conductance because the abs are resonances . on resonance , letting @xmath196 , fluctuations vanish@xcite and @xmath197 , which is a fingerprint of resonant andreev reflection .",
    "the enhanced role of two - particle andreev processes substantially reduces the spin - polarization of transferred current , see fig .",
    "[ transport](e ) .    finally , we point out that the non - zero spin conductance at the interface leads to spin imbalance , an unequal population of quasiparticle branches with opposite spin projections . for",
    "randomly oriented impurity spins , spin imbalance at subgap voltages induced by spin - polarized abs was studied by two of us in a recent publication @xcite .",
    "before summarizing the main findings , let us briefly comment on the applicability of our model .",
    "in all the calculations , we have assumed that the ysr states of neighboring impurities have enough wavefunction overlap to form extended metallic impurity bands .",
    "the necessary condition for this to happen is the mott criterion @xcite @xmath198 , which estimates the minimal impurity density necessary for the delocalization transition . in terms of the parameters of our model we obtain @xmath199 ( @xmath162 is the bulk critical temperature of the superconductor in absence of impurities ) , meaning that this condition is satisfied for all the values of @xmath169 used in our calculations since @xmath200 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied charge and spin transport in ns junctions with a finite density of magnetic impurities .",
    "the latter were described within the non - crossing @xmath40-matrix approach .",
    "considering the two extreme cases  completely unpolarized and polarized impurities  we have investigated both electric current and noise across the ns surface .",
    "the results of our calculations indicate that adding magnetic impurities to conventional @xmath1-wave spin - singlet superconductors can substantially extend functionalities of superconducting hybrid devices .",
    "we find that in the case when magnetic impurities are ferromagnetically ordered , one can achieve spin - polarizations of the tunneling currents reaching @xmath193 .",
    "moreover , for a suitable choice of system parameters , the sign of spin - polarization can be chosen by simply tuning the applied bias .",
    "we also demonstrate that even when magnetic impurities are completely unpolarized , one can still inject almost entirely spin - polarized currents across the ns junction . in order to achieve",
    "that , we propose to engineer spin - active interfaces between the superconductor and the normal - metal probe .",
    "the latter is not just a theoretical model , but was successfully realized in practice by several experimental groups @xcite .",
    "all these features make impurity engineering in superconductors a promising route towards hybrid superconducting spintronic applications .",
    "finally , by analyzing the noise properties of the tunneling currents , we were able to decipher the relative role of single - particle excitations and cooper pairs , which can be tuned by changing the ns interface transparency . in the tunneling limit , the currents are predominantly carried by single - particle excitations , while cooper pairs dominate electric transport at high tranparencies .",
    "we would like to acknowledge financial support from the swedish research council .",
    "the research of os was partly supported by the national science foundation ( grant dmr-1508730 ) .",
