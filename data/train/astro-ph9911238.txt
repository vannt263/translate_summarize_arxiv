    "the spin - down of sgr 1900 + 14 from 1966 september to 1999 april ( figure 1 ) is characterized by three intervals of time for which the spin - down rate was essentially constant within the interval .",
    "this characterization of the sgr 1900 + 14 spin - down is based upon either direct measurements of @xmath4 as part of the period determination , or upon differences in measured spin periods between two different observations .",
    "the first interval begins with the rxte observation in september of 1996 and ends with the asca observation at the beginning of may , 1998 .",
    "the mean spin - down @xmath5 6@xmath110@xmath6 s / s ( marsden , rothschild and lingenfelter 1999a ; hurley et al .",
    "1999 ; woods et al .",
    "the second interval begins with the onset of bursting on may 26 , 1998 and continues until mid - september 1998 .",
    "the mean spin - down during this time @xmath513@xmath110@xmath6 s / s ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 ; marsden , rothschild and lingenfelter 1999a ; murakami et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the third interval begins in mid - september 1998 and continues at least until march 30 , 1999 .",
    "the mean spin - down at that time @xmath5 6@xmath110@xmath6 s / s ( woods et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "woods et al ( 1999b ) have suggested that the data may be consistent with a discontinuous spin - down event during the second interval as a result of the superburst , as opposed to a doubling of @xmath4 during the entire second interval ( marsden , rothschild and lingenfelter 1999a ) .",
    "this appears to be at odds with the measurement of @xmath4=(11.0@xmath71.7)@xmath110@xmath6 s / s in early june , 1998 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 ) , approximately 3 months before the superburst and with the rxte / asca determination of @xmath5 10@xmath110@xmath6 s / s just after the event ( murakami et al .",
    "assuming that the spin - down torque is given by @xmath8 , the age of a pulsar with period @xmath9 and spin - down @xmath4 is given by    @xmath10 $ ]    where the spin - down braking index , @xmath11 = 3 for pure magnetic dipole radiation and @xmath12 1 for wind torques . inverting the age equation yields    @xmath13 .    using parameters appropriate for sgr 1900 + 14 , we find that    @xmath14yr ) .",
    "this indicates that the braking index for sgr 1900 + 14 must be @xmath01 , and that the spin - down of sgr 1900 + 14 is dominated by torques due to the relativistic wind and not magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "in reality , there will be more than one torque spinning down the pulsar at any given time . the torque provided by the emission of a relativistic wind is ( thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the neutron star moment of inertia , @xmath17 is the luminosity of the wind , @xmath18 is the spin frequency , @xmath19 is the spin - down rate due to the wind , and @xmath20 is the alfven radius .",
    "@xmath21 is a constant equal to 2/3 for a magnetic dipole field aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "the alfven radius is given by :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the magnetic field of the neutron star . when the alfven radius is inside the light cylinder radius ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ) ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the radius of the neutron star and dipole geometry is assumed .",
    "when the alfven is outside the light cylinder radius , the torque is limited to    @xmath28    the transition frequency between these two wind spin - down regimes is     @xmath29 radians / s .",
    "the torque due to a rotating magnetic dipole is ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) :    @xmath30    where k = 1 ( harding , contopoulos , & kazanas 1999 ) .",
    "once the total spin - down torque is specified as a function of @xmath31 , the age of the sgr can found by the integral of @xmath32 over the total torque divided by @xmath16 , where the integration is performed from an initial frequency to the present - day angular frequency .",
    "using the above model we explore a wide range of magnetic fields @xmath23 and wind luminosity @xmath17 , shown in fig .",
    "we see that the presently observed period of @xmath9 = 5.157 s , the spindown rate of @xmath33 s / s ( dotted lines ) of sgr 1900 + 14 , and the 10 to 20 kyr range of ages ( solid lines ) of its associated supernova remnant g42.8 + 0.6 ( vaisht et al .",
    "1994 ) , tightly constrain the allowable magnetic field to @xmath34 g and wind luminosities @xmath35 erg / s .",
    "compared to the quiescent 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath36 erg / s ( murakami et al .",
    "1999 ) , this wind luminosity implies a @xmath3 2 % conversion efficiency of wind energy to x - rays in that band which is quite consistent with theoretical calculations ( tavani 1994 , harding 1995 ; harding , contopoulos & kazanas 1999 ) .",
    "the magnetic field limits are also quite consistent with the limiting values inferred for radio pulsars , but not with those expected for magnetars .",
    "very similar limits are set by comparable analyses ( harding , contopoulos , & kazanas 1999 ; marsden , rothschild & lingenfelter 1999b ) of sgr 1806 - 20 and its supernova remnant g10.0 - 0.3 ."
