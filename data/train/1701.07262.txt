    "polar codes @xcite provably achieves the capacity of channels by using the ( low complexity ) decoding algorithm , in the limit of infinite block length . at short block lengths polar codes under decoding tend to exhibit a poor performance . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that such a behavior might be due , on one hand , to an intrinsic weakness of polar codes and , on the other hand , to the sub - optimality of decoding w.r.t . decoding .",
    "an improved decoding algorithms were proposed in @xcite , while the structural properties of polar codes ( e.g. , their distance properties ) were studied , among others , in @xcite .",
    "the minimum distance properties of polar codes can be improved by resorting to concatenated schemes like the one of @xcite , where the concatenation of polar codes with an outer code is considered .",
    "this solution , together with the use of the list decoding algorithm of @xcite , allows short polar codes to become competitive against other families of codes @xcite .",
    "a theoretical characterization of the performance of concatenated -polar codes is still an open problem .",
    "furthermore , for a fixed code length , a concatenated scheme can be realized with several combinations of the component codes parameters ( e.g. , one may choose various polynomials and polar codes designed for different target signal - to - noise ratios ) .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an analysis of the concatenation of polar codes with binary cyclic outer codes .",
    "the analysis is carried out by introducing concatenated ensembles and by deriving by following the well - known uniform interleaver approach @xcite . in the analysis , the knowledge of the of the inner polar code",
    "is required . however , the polar code calculation through analytical methods is still an unsolved problem .",
    "hence , we restrict our attention to short , high - rate polar codes for which the problem can be solved through a pragmatic approach . more precisely , we consider the dual code of the selected polar code and then we find its by listing the codewords .",
    "subsequently , by using the generalized macwilliams identity @xcite , we obtain the of the original polar code .",
    "the of the outer cyclic code , instead , is computed by following the method presented in @xcite .    by adopting the uniform interleaver approach , we subsume the existence of an interleaver between the inner and the outer code , and",
    "obtain the average performance of an ensemble composed by the codes obtained by selecting all possible interleavers .",
    "our analysis shows that the performance of the concatenated scheme with and without interleaver ( as proposed in @xcite ) may differ substantially .",
    "similarly , by considering both and outer codes , we show that the choice of the outer code plays an important role in the short block length regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "notation and definitions are introduced in section [ sec : definitions ] .",
    "the distance spectrum analysis of the concatenated scheme is discussed in section [ sec : upperunionbound ] .",
    "numerical results are reported in section [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be the hamming weight of a vector .",
    "we denote as @xmath1 and @xmath2 the outer cyclic code length and dimension , respectively , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 identify the same parameters for the inner polar code .",
    "therefore , the code rates of the outer and inner code are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the two codes can be serially concatenated on condition that @xmath7 , thus the overall code rate of the concatenated code is @xmath8 .",
    "given a binary linear code @xmath9 , its is defined as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of codewords @xmath12 with @xmath13 . in this work",
    "we focus on systematic polar codes ( the reason of this choice will be discussed later ) so the first @xmath4 bits of a codeword @xmath12 coincide with the information vector @xmath14 , yielding @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the parity vector .",
    "the of a code @xmath9 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the multiplicity of codewords @xmath12 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the enumeration of the codeword weights entails a large complexity even for small code dimensions . in order to overcome this problem and obtain the of the considered polar codes",
    ", we focus on short , high - rate polar codes and we exploit the generalized macwilliams identity @xcite .",
    "this approach was followed also for cyclic codes , for example , in @xcite to compute the of several .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the dual code of @xmath22 .",
    "given the dual code @xmath23 , we can express the original code @xmath24 as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cardinality of the dual code .",
    "when the is of interest , a significant reduction of the computational cost can be achieved by considering systematic codes .",
    "for such reason , in this work we have used only systematic inner polar codes . in the case of a systematic code @xmath9 , it is convenient to derive the from the @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the multiplicity of codewords @xmath12 with @xmath19 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "hence , starting from the of the dual code @xmath33 , we have @xcite @xmath34 then , the is obtained as @xmath35",
    "given an ensemble of binary linear codes @xmath36 , the expected @xmath37 of a random code @xmath38 under decoding over a with erasure probability @xmath39 can be upper bounded as @xcite @xmath40 \\leq p_b^{(s)}(n , k,\\epsilon ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_{e=1}^k \\binom{n}{e } \\epsilon^e(1-\\epsilon)^{n - e } \\min\\left\\{1,\\sum_{\\omega=1}^e\\binom{e}{n}\\frac{\\bar{a}_\\omega}{\\binom{n}{\\omega}}\\right\\ } \\label{eq : upperunionbound}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] is the average multiplicity of codewords with @xmath20 and @xmath42 represents the of an ideal code , with parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the in is applicable to every code ensemble whose expected is known . in order to use , the of the concatenated code ensemble must be known .",
    "when dealing with concatenated codes , it is commonplace to consider a general setting including an interleaver between the inner and the outer codes .",
    "the concatenated code ensemble is hence given by the codes obtained by selecting all possible interleavers . the special case without any interleaver can then be modeled as an identity interleaver . from @xcite",
    ", the of a concatenation formed by an inner polar code and an outer cyclic code can be obtained from the cyclic code and the polar code as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the weight enumerator of the outer code and @xmath45 is the input - output weight enumerator of the inner code ( we remind that the average multiplicities resulting from are , in general , real numbers ) .",
    "the ensemble @xmath36 contains the codes generated by all possible interleavers .",
    "thus , also bad codes ( i.e. , characterized by bad error rate performance ) belong to the ensemble .",
    "it is clear that the bad codes adversely affect the obtained through causing a too pessimistic estimate of the error probability obtained through , with respect to that achieved by properly designed codes .",
    "a simple way to overcome this issue is to divide @xmath36 into the bad and good code subsets , and then derive the only of good codes through the expurgated @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the good and the bad codes ensemble , respectively . in this work we have assumed @xmath49 , hence at least one code belongs to the good codes ensemble .",
    "therefore , when the expurgation method is adoptable ( i.e. , the first term of the has a codewords multiplicity less than @xmath50 ) , through and the average performance of the good codes subset is derived .",
    "studying the dual codes and exploiting macwilliams identities allow considerable reductions in complexity of exhaustive analysis as long as the original code rate is sufficiently large .",
    "this will be the case for the component codes considered next , which are characterized by @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , in our case and can effectively be exploited to calculate @xmath44 and @xmath45 in .",
    "in this section we consider several examples of polar - cyclic concatenated codes and assess their performance through the approach described in the previous sections .",
    "our focus is on short , high rate component codes , which allow to perform exhaustive analysis of their duals in a reasonable time .",
    "our results are obtained considering a with erasure probability @xmath39 . as known , in the polar code construction a fixed value of the error transition probability is considered .",
    "therefore , as usual in literature , in each of the following examples the polar code is designed by using @xmath52 .",
    "all performance curves provided next are obtained through .",
    "we consider codes with @xmath53 bits and a or a outer code , with @xmath1 according to the polar code dimension . in this work ,",
    "we have used a @xmath54 and a @xmath55 with the following generator polynomials @xmath56 @xcite :    * @xmath54 : @xmath57 ; * @xmath58ccitt : @xmath59 .    instead ,",
    "regarding the code , we study two codes that have the same redundancy as the -8 and -16 codes . thus , for the same @xmath60 value , a performance comparison of the results achieved by using a or a outer code is feasible and fair . in order to keep the selected polar codes unchanged ,",
    "we have considered shortened codes .    for the case without interleaver considered in @xcite ,",
    "the generator matrix @xmath61 of the concatenated code can be obtained from the cyclic and polar code generator matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , as @xmath64 when we instead consider the more general case with an interleaver between the inner and outer codes , we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an @xmath67 permutation matrix representing the interleaver . considering all codes in @xmath36 ,",
    "leads to their and hence to the average performance in terms of , according to the uniform interleaver approach . in order to have an idea of the gap between this average performance and those of single codes in the ensemble , in each of the following figures we include the performance of codes randomly picked in @xmath36 . without changing the outer and inner code ,",
    "this can be easily done by introducing a random interleaver between the cyclic code and the polar code in the concatenated scheme .",
    "hence , in this case , the matrix @xmath66 in is a random permutation matrix . for readability reasons , in addition to the solution without interleaver , in each of the following examples , we have considered only @xmath68 random interleavers ; however , the obtained results allow to address some general conclusions .",
    "moreover , when the results of the expurgated @xmath36 differs from that achieved by the , its performance in terms of is also considered .",
    "the of the considered polar code alone is also included as a reference .",
    "clearly , the comparison between the performance of the polar code and those of the concatenated schemes is not completely fair at least because of the different code rates ; however , in this way , the performance gain achieved through concatenation can be pointed out .",
    "figures [ fig : polar64 - 48-crc8 ] and [ fig : polar64 - 48-bch48 - 40 ] show the of the concatenated scheme , with and without random interleaver , formed by a polar code with @xmath69 and an outer cyclic code with @xmath70 ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) in terms of . in fig .",

    "this trend is due to the different minimum distance @xmath72 of the codes .",
    "the results in figs .",
