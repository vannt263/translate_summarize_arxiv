    "such nonlinear josephson equations admit solutions in the form of small periodic oscillations , whose period is determined by two key parameters : the mean - field ( on - site ) energy and the tunnelling energy . when the nonlinearity arising from the mean - field interaction exceeds a critical value , the system may exhibit self - trapped solutions with the relative population oscillating around a nonzero value .",

    "a similar nlse has been used to discuss in detail the transition from josephson oscillations to self - trapping @xcite .",
    "some open issues are worth considering .",
    "first , the applicability of a two - mode model to weakly linked dilute fermi superfluids has been tested so far only within a density functional approach describing a gas of bosonic pairs ( namely cooper pairs , which become molecules in the bec limit ) ; being a generalization of the gp equation , the theory naturally reduces to the two - mode model under the same assumptions as for coupled becs .",
    "it is thus interesting to test the two - mode model also within a more microscopic theory like bdg which includes fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "second , the available bdg calculations @xcite and their comparison with the density functional results @xcite are limited to the case of a stationary current through a low and thick barrier , where the flow is almost hydrodynamic and a local density approximation can be applied @xcite ; time dependent simulations with higher and thinner barriers can provide a a more stringent and informative test .",
    "finally , the stationary bdg equations does not include bosonic collective modes ( e.g. , phonons ) in the spectrum of excitations and can not address the problem of dynamical instabilities , soliton nucleation , phase slips , etc .",

    ". this type of physics can instead be addressed by time - dependent bdg simulations .    motivated by the above arguments , we numerically solve the time - dependent bdg equations of a superfluid gas of fermions confined in a box with a square potential barrier at the center .",
    "the square barrier is a convenient choice for computational reasons , but the main results of this work would not change by using barriers of different shape . in the limit of weakly linked superfluids we find periodic oscillations",
    "whose frequency approaches the prediction of the two - mode model , namely the josephson `` plasma '' frequency @xmath0 @xcite , where the tunneling energy @xmath1 and the on - site mean - field energy @xmath2 are obtained by solving the stationary bdg equations in the same configurations . by increasing the population imbalance we explore the transition from josephson oscillations to self - trapping .",

    "@xcite , as well as with the predictions of the coupled nonlinear josephson equations which can be derived from the nlse in the weak link limit .",
    "the latter equations turn out to agree surprisingly well with the bdg simulations , provided the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are consistently calculated within the same bdg theory .",

    "such an agreement could not be foretold _ a priori _ since , on one hand , a formal derivation of the nonlinear josephson equations from the bdg equations is yet missing and , on the other hand , the role played by fermionic degrees of freedom in the dynamics of a superfluid subject to density and phase variations on the lengthscale of the inverse fermi wave vector is largely unkown .",
    "our results indicate that the dynamics at the weak link is dominated by tunneling of bosonic pairs , with the caveat that the critical josephson current @xmath76 in the bcs side of the crossover is determined by pair - beaking processes . for lower barriers and large tunneling ,",

    "we have first checked that , at unitarity , without barrier and in the limit of large @xmath23 , the energy @xmath108 converges to the energy of a uniform infinite gas : @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the value of the bertsch parameter in bdg theory @xcite . in the same situation , the quantity @xmath114 measures the cost in energy associated to creation of the density depletion and the nodal structure of the order parameter at the box center , corresponding to a dark soliton @xcite .",

    ", @xmath114 approaches the same value in the limit of vanishingly small barrier ( i.e , for @xmath210 at finite @xmath21 ) .",
    "this value is @xmath211 , which is slightly larger than the energy of dark soliton in an infinite system , due to the finite box sixe . for @xmath21 of the order of @xmath30 , the quantity @xmath114 is rapidly decreasing when @xmath20 increases .",
