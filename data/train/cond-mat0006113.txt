    "simple mechanical models are helpful for understanding the complex dynamical behaviour of polymer molecules . the so - called elastic",
    "dumbbell constitutes the simplest model that captures the effects of stretching and orientation of the polymer @xcite . in this model",
    "the polymer is represented by two beads which are connected by a spring .",
    "the classical hookean dumbbell model @xcite is characterised by a linear spring force .",
    "its relaxation times decrease like the inverse of the mode number and the relaxation modulus is of a single exponential form .",
    "as noted by many authors , the finite extensibility of the molecules has to be included in order to avoid unphysical behaviour such as infinite viscosities predicted by the hookean model .",
    "it is even argued `` that taking into account the nonlinear stretching of the polymer molecules is the most important correction that should be made to the hookean model in order to describe real systems '' ( ref .",
    "@xcite , chap .",
    "13 , p. 81 ) .",
    "molecular arguments suggest the finitely extensible spring force law to be given by the inverse langevin function @xcite . very often , rational @xcite or pad approximations @xcite to the inverse langevin function are used since they are analytically more tractable .",
    "all these approximations show the desired physical characteristics : a linear regime for small extensions of the spring and a divergence at a finite extension .",
    "these forces therefore prohibit the molecule to stretch beyond a certain value which is related to the total length of the chain .",
    "in general , the finite extensibility of the molecules prohibits analytical expressions for the spectrum of relaxation times and the relaxation modulus .",
    "the shear relaxation modulus for the warner spring force ( so - called fene model , @xcite ) has been determined numerically @xcite .",
    "the results are very close to those obtained for the peterlin approximation to the warner force ( fene - p model , @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the finite extensibility on the spectrum of relaxation times remains less studied .",
    "one might speculate that the finite extensibility decreases the slowest relaxation time as described by the peterlin approximation .",
    "however , knowledge of the whole spectrum of relaxation times would be very desirable for understanding the dynamics of dumbbell models .",
    "it would allow , for example , to identify the number of relevant slow modes that contribute to the polymer contribution to the stress .",
    "work in this direction was performed in @xcite where the universal constitutive equation of dilute polymeric solutions was found .",
    "there , it was assumed that in the limit of low deborah and weissenberg number the modes corresponding to the two lowest eigenvalues dominate .    here",
    ", we compute the relaxation times , eigenfunctions and the relaxation modulus of a finitely extensible dumbbell model exactly .",
    "the model is a one - dimensional version of the finitely extensible dumbbell models that uses trigonometric functions to approximate the inverse langevin force .",
    "it is demonstrated that this force approximates the inverse langevin function as good or even better than the warner force frequently used in brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "the present study therefore clarifies the effect of the finitely extensible spring force on the spectrum of relaxation times , eigenfunctions and the relaxation modulus .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the distribution function of the connector vector @xmath1 of the dumbbell at time @xmath2 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath3 is given by the well - known fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath4 + \\nabla \\right\\ } f       \\equiv l_{\\rm fp } f\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the spring force @xmath5 can be derived from the dimensionless potential @xmath6 via @xmath7 .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath8 is assumed to be independent of @xmath1 which means we neglect hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "note that the equilibrium distribution @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 being a normalization constant . as is well - known the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpeq ] ) can be transformed into an equivalent imaginary time schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 is a solution to @xmath13 with the operator @xmath14 , then the function @xmath15 solves the original fokker - planck equation ( [ fpeq ] ) . in particular",
    ", solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath16 leads immediately to the solution of the eigenvalue problem of the original fokker - planck operator @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where factors @xmath20 are introduced for later convenience . inserting ( [ fpeq ] ) for the fokker - planck operator @xmath21",
    "yields the form of the schrdinger operator @xmath22 where the schrdinger potential @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , each solvable potential for the schrdinger equation serves as a solvable model for the fokker - planck equation . in the following , we benefit from the fact that simple schrdinger potentials @xmath23 can have quite complicated counterparts @xmath6 for the fokker - planck equation",
    "note also that operator @xmath21 is hermitian which is in general not the case for @xmath26 .",
    "the simplest exactly solvable potential for the schrdinger equation related to finite extensibility is the three dimensional spherical symmetric infinite well potential .",
    "up to a constant , the corresponding potential @xmath6 of the fokker - planck equation is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the ground state of the schrdinger problem .",
    "in the present case , the ground state is known to be @xmath29 with @xmath30 leading to the force law @xmath31 since the force ( [ 3dforce ] ) is one - parametric , the `` spring constant '' is no adjustable parameter but determined by the maximum extension @xmath32 .",
    "if we define the spring constant @xmath33 in the linear regime of ( [ 3dforce ] ) , the dimensionless finite extensibility parameter @xmath34 is fixed : @xmath35 .",
    "parameter @xmath36 is known to denote roughly the number of monomer units represented by the dumbbell and should therefore be a large number .",
    "thus , ( [ 3dforce ] ) is of limited use .",
    "however , if @xmath37 is acceptable the force ( [ 3dforce ] ) compares very well to the inverse langevin force and cohen s pad approximation , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ forces ] . in this case ,",
    "exact eigenfunctions of the schrdinger operator are known to be the spherical bessel functions and the exact eigenvalues are given by the zeros of this functions .",
    "let us now consider the one - dimensional case .",
    "one - dimensional nonlinear dumbbell models serve as toy models for various approximations that have been proposed to obtain closed constitutive equations for polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the one - dimensional models are believed to describe the elongational behaviour of the polymer molecule reasonably @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional version of the operators @xmath26 and @xmath21 is obtained by replacing @xmath1 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    to account for the finite extensibility we propose the following two parameter family of force laws @xmath41 where @xmath42 is determined by the maximum extension @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the `` spring constant '' in the sense @xmath43 for @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ forces ] we plot the force @xmath45 as a function of the reduced extension @xmath46",
    "[ forces ] also shows the warner force @xcite @xmath47 , the inverse langevin force @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and cohen s pad approximation @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "it is easily verified that these approximations give the correct limiting behaviour not only for small but also near the maximum extension .",
    "in addition , as can be seen from fig . [ forces ] , the force ( [ 1dforce ] ) serves as an even better approximation to the inverse langevin force as does the warner force .",
    "therefore we accept ( [ 1dforce ] ) as a reasonable force law to substitute for the inverse langevin force in one dimension .",
    "the potential @xmath6 from which the force ( [ 1dforce ] ) can be derived is @xmath51 , where we introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function of the fokker - planck equation is @xmath53 , with @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 $ ] is the beta function .",
    "the equilibrium distribution is very close to the one corresponding to the warner force @xmath56 , with @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "to obtain exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpeq ] ) we exploit supersymmetry methods for the corresponding schrdinger problem .",
    "note , that the model force ( [ 1dforce ] ) belongs to the class of so - called poeschl - teller potentials which may also be solved exactly by schrdinger s factorization method @xcite .",
    "consider the original potential @xmath6 together with the inverted potential @xmath58 and denote by @xmath59 the solution for the potential @xmath6 and @xmath60 for @xmath58 .",
    "as done before , defining @xmath61 we arrive at @xmath62 with operators @xmath63 .",
    "the `` partner potentials '' are given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the derivative of @xmath68 resp .",
    "@xmath6 with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "schrdinger operators @xmath69 are very well studied in the literature since they occur in the so - called `` witten model '' @xcite , which is the simplest model that shows all typical features of supersymmetric quantum mechanics .    rewriting the force ( [ 1dforce ] ) as @xmath70 we obtain @xmath71 , for @xmath72 .",
    "we denote explicitly the dependence on the parameter @xmath73 which is proportional to the spring constant @xmath33 .",
    "to proceed further we take advantage of the concept of `` shape invariance '' introduced by gendenshten @xcite .",
    "the partner potentials @xmath74 are called shape invariant if they are related by @xmath75 where the new parameter @xmath76 is a function of @xmath77 . in our case ,",

    "the polymer contribution to the stress , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , is found to be @xmath101 where the relaxation modulus @xmath102 is given by the equilibrium correlation function @xmath103 . inserting the completeness relation of the eigenfunctions , @xmath104",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 which is of the form of the `` generalized maxwell model '' .",
    "note , that only even terms are included in ( [ maxwell ] ) since they correspond to symmetric eigenfunctions whereas odd terms , corresponding to antisymmetric eigenfunctions , vanish by symmetry .",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath102 resulting from dumbbell models are known for linear springs ( hookean dumbbell ) where @xmath106 . for the warner spring force",
    "no such expression is available .",

    "the finite extensibility of the dumbbell therefore reduces the longest relaxation time when compared to the hookean dumbbell . only in the limit",
    "@xmath110 the result for the hookean dumbbell is recovered . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ reltimes ] , @xmath102 is dominated by the lowest relaxation time since the relative weight of the higher modes decreases rapidly . for @xmath111 , the relative weight of the first two modes is @xmath112 , for @xmath113 the first mode carries @xmath112 and for @xmath114 all weights except for the first vanish , reflecting the single - exponential form of the hookean dumbbell .",

    "coefficients @xmath124 are still of exponential form but with a different time constant @xmath129 .",
    "modes that decrease quadratically with number @xmath127 will then be negligible .",
    "this leads to a minimal number of modes @xmath130 that satisfies @xmath131 .",
    "if this number is not too large , method ( [ coeff ] ) is much more efficient than brownian dynamics simulation .",
    "we have obtained the spectrum of relaxation times , the eigenfunctions and the relaxation modulus for a one - dimensional finitely extensible dumbbell model exactly . it is observed that the relaxation times are reduced when compared to the hookean dumbbell model .",
    "moreover , the decrease of the relaxation times with mode number @xmath127 shows a crossover from @xmath132 to @xmath133 at the value of the finite extensibility parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the relaxation modulus is obtained in the form of the `` generalized maxwell model '' . for rather large values of the finite extensibility parameter @xmath36 , which are commonly believed to be physically meaningful ( see , e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "the linear viscoelastic behaviour is well described by a single relaxation time .",
    "this is because the relative weight of the higher modes is decreasing rapidly with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the linear viscoelastic regime is well described by the peterlin approximation as found in @xcite . to calculate the non - linear dynamical response to a given flow kinematics we propose a numerical integration scheme using the expansion of the distribution function into the exact eigenfunctions in the absence of flow .",
    "all these results are limited to the one - dimensional case . in three dimensions",
    "the class of solvable potentials is much more restricted .",
    "in particular we did not find any relevant two parameter potential that can be solved exactly .",
