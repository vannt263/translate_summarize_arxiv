    "the cross section of @xmath0 pair production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is very large , and this process can be a serious background for many experiments . besides , it is also important for the problem of beam lifetime and luminosity of hadron colliders .",
    "it means that various corrections to the born cross section for one - pair production , as well as the cross section for @xmath7-pair production ( @xmath8 ) , are very important .",
    "recently , the process was discussed in numerous papers , see reviews bb88,bhts2002,bkn2005 .",
    "however , some important aspects of the problem have not been finally understood , and in the present paper we are going to elucidate them .    for our purpose , it is convenient to consider a collision of the nuclei @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the corresponding charge numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the rest frame of the nucleus @xmath9 .",
    "the nucleus @xmath10 is assumed to move in the positive direction of the @xmath11 axis having the lorentz factor @xmath12 . for @xmath13 , it is possible to treat the nuclei as sources of the external field , and calculate the probability of @xmath7-pair production @xmath14 in collision of two nuclei at a fixed impact parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding cross section @xmath15 is obtained by the integration over the impact parameter , @xmath16 average number of the produced pairs at a given @xmath1 reads : @xmath17 the function @xmath18 defines the number - weighted cross section @xmath19 the closed expression for @xmath20 was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , though the correct meaning of this expression was recognized later in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the cross section @xmath20 can be presented in the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the born cross section , i.e. , the cross section calculated in the lowest - order perturbation theory with respect to the parameters @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath26 is the electron charge , @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the coulomb corrections with respect to one of the nuclei ( containing the terms proportional to @xmath29 or @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is the coulomb corrections with respect to both nuclei ( containing the terms proportional to @xmath33 with @xmath34 ) .",

    "@xcite is the same as in .",
    "the uncertainty is related to the contribution of the region , where the energies of electron and positron are of the order of electron mass in the rest frame of one of the nuclei .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was claimed that the factorization of the multiple pair production probability is valid with a good accuracy , resulting in the poisson distribution for multiplicity : @xmath42 the factor @xmath43 is nothing but the vacuum - to - vacuum transition probability @xmath44 .",
    "strictly speaking , the factorization does not take place due to interference between the diagrams corresponding to the permutation of the electron ( or positron ) lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can show that this interference gives the contribution which contains at least one power of @xmath45 less than that of the amplitude squared .",
