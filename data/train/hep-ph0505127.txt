    "the helicity distribution is one of the three fundamental quark distributions of the nucleon , and it has been explored for more than two decades in deep inelastic scattering progresses",
    ". deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments of polarized electrons and muons from polarized nucleons have confirmed us that the total quark - plus - antiquark helicity sum is only about 1/4 to 1/3 of the proton spin  @xcite .",
    "however , inclusive dis experiments can not provide information on the polarized quark and antiquark density separately .",
    "semi - inclusive dis measurements are one of the approaches to achieve a separation of quark and antiquark helicity densities  @xcite . but these experiments depend on the details of the fragmentation process , so their accuracy is limited . in these experiments ,",
    "spin asymmetry is one of the most important quantity to study the quark helicity distributions .",
    "the jefferson lab hall a collaboration has released a precision result on the neutron spin asymmetry  @xcite at large @xmath6 , which provides an examination on some known quark distribution models .",
    "the disadvantage of semi - inclusive dis process can be avoided by using the production of @xmath7 bosons at rhic  @xcite .",
    "about ten years ago , soffer and his collaborators pointed out that the polarization of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 in the proton will be measured directly and precisely using the maximum parity violation of @xmath7 bosons in @xmath12 and @xmath13 at high @xmath14  . at leading order , the single spin asymmetry , or",
    "the parity - violating asymmetry , of @xmath0 will approach to the ratio @xmath15 when the absolute value of the rapidity of @xmath7 , @xmath16 , is large .",
    "some works have been done to calculate this asymmetry with different quark distribution models  .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that the parity - violating asymmetry of @xmath17 bosons in longitudinally polarized @xmath1-@xmath1 process at rhic can provide a crucial test of different predictions on @xmath4 from a pqcd based analysis and the su(6 ) quark - spectator - diquark models , because it is very sensitive to the value of @xmath4 at @xmath5 in the proton .",
    "the parity - violating asymmetry is defined as the difference of the cross section of the left - handed ( @xmath18 ) beams and that of the right - handed ( @xmath19 ) beams , divided by the sum of them , or using the number density of the beams instead and normalized by the polarization : @xmath20    the production of @xmath7 is dominated by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 contributions , with some contamination of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 contributions , mostly through quark mixing .",
    "therefore @xmath7 production is an ideal tool to study the spin - flavor structure of the nucleon .",
    "the expected sensitivities at rhic are also given in ref .",
    "phenix and star both expect to get the enough @xmath25 data for analysis",
    ".    at rhic , the @xmath0 will be produced in sub - processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 by colliding beams of protons spinning alternately left- and right - handed .    for standard model , the leading order production of @xmath2s ,",
    "is partly illustrated in fig.[wproduction ]  @xcite .",
    "due to that the production of left - handed @xmath7 bosons violate parity , the asymmetry can be constructed from polarized beams with two directions . as fig .",
    "[ wproduction ] shows , the @xmath8 quark only comes from the polarized proton , the asymmetry should be expressed as : @xmath26    in the above equation , superscripts refer to the quark helicity and subscripts refer to that of proton .",
    "@xmath27 is short for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the mass of @xmath7 bosons .",
    "for the situation that the @xmath11 quark comes from the polarized proton , the asymmetry should be simply written as : @xmath33    in general , the asymmetry is a superposition of the two cases : @xmath34 the asymmetry of @xmath3 can be got easily by interchanging @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath35 higher - order corrections change the asymmetries only a little  @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of @xmath7 production and drell - yan production of lepton pairs are the same . the momentum fraction carried by the quarks and antiquarks , @xmath36 ,",
    "can be determined by the rapidity of @xmath7 , @xmath16 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the center - of - mass energy .",
    "this picture is valid only for the predominant production of @xmath7s at @xmath39 . in reality",
    ", the @xmath7 has @xmath40 , which comes from the higher level contributions such as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , or the primordial @xmath40 for the initial parton .",
    "but we must point out that when @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "so if we take @xmath39 in calculation , the results are also valuable at large @xmath16 .",
    "the experimental difficulty is that the @xmath7 is observed through its leptonic decay @xmath46 , and only the charged lepton is observed .",
    "the connection of the rapidity of observed leptons and that of @xmath7s has been described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . and",
    "the expected cross section of @xmath7s has also been estimated in that article .",

    "two known models , the quark - diquark model  @xcite and a pqcd based counting rule analysis  @xcite , can provide predictions of the quark distributions .",
    "both models have their advantages and have played important roles in the investigation of various nucleon structure functions .",
    "however , there are still some unknowns concerning the sea content of the nucleon and the large @xmath6 behaviors of valence quark . for example , there are still some uncertainties concerning the flavor decomposition of the quark helicity distributions at large @xmath6 , especially for the less dominant @xmath9 valence quark of the proton .",
    "there are two different theoretical predictions of the ratio @xmath4 at @xmath49 : the pqcd base counting rule analysis  @xcite predicts @xmath50 whereas the su(6 ) quark - diquark model  @xcite predicts @xmath51 .",
    "experimental data of recent years show that both of these two models are good in the predictions of @xmath52 , and of the @xmath53 extracted from it . but",
    "results of jefferson lab hall a collaboration show that the pqcd prediction on @xmath54 deviates from the data  @xcite .",
    "figures [ g1p],[g1n ] and [ duvsu ] show the predictions of these two models and the comparison with experimental data .",
    "it seems that the pqcd predictions fit the data good at small @xmath55 whereas the su(6 ) quark - diquark model works good at large @xmath56 .",
    "we can expect that the different predictions on @xmath4 of the two models may lead to prominent differences in calculating the parity - violating asymmetry of @xmath17 , due to the case that @xmath57 when @xmath16 is large .",
    "detailed constructions of the quark helicity distributions in the two models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to make realistic predictions of measurable quantities , we need also to take into the sea quark contribution in the two model constructions . in the quark - diquark case",
    ", this can be achieved by adopting one set of unpolarized quark distribution parametrization as input , and then use theoretical relations to connect the quark helicity distributions with the unpolarized distributions  @xcite : @xmath58w_s(x)-\\frac{1}{6}d_v(x)w_v(x),\\\\ \\delta d_v(x ) & -{\\displaystyle}\\frac{1}{3}d_v(x)w_v(x ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the melosh - wigner rotation factors  @xcite for spectator scalar and vector diquarks .",
    "we use the valence quark momentum distributions @xmath61 and @xmath62 from quark distribution parametrization , but with @xmath59 and @xmath60 from the model calculation  @xcite . in this way we can take into account the sea contribution for the unpolarized quark distribution from the input parametrization . the energy scale dependence and the @xmath14 evolution behaviors of the quark distributions",
    "can be reflected by the explicitly @xmath14 dependence of the input quark distribution parametrization .",
    "this can provide a more reliable prediction for the magnitude and shape of a physical quantity than directly from the model calculation .",
    "cteq dis  @xcite ( cteq5 set 2 ) quark distributions are used for parametrization to investigate the evolution of the helicity distribution . from fig .",
    "[ fig : cduvsu ] we found that the ratios of @xmath63 and @xmath64 changed little with the increase of @xmath14 in this model .",
    "evolution of the helicity distributions .",
    "prediction of the decomposition @xmath65 and @xmath66 of quark - diquark model ( thick curves ) and pqcd based analysis ( thin curves ) for @xmath67  gev@xmath48 ( solid curves ) and @xmath68  gev@xmath48 ( dashed curves ) . ]    for the pqcd based analysis , we take the same consideration as the above and make the following connection to relate the pqcd model quark distributions with the parametrization : @xmath69 where the superscripts `` th '' means the pure theoretical calculation in the pqcd analysis , and `` para '' means the input from parametrization .",
    "the superscript `` pqcd '' means that the new quark distributions keep exactly the same flavor and spin structure as those in the pqcd analysis , but with detailed @xmath6-dependent behaviors more close to the realistic situation .",
    "this is equivalent to using a factor , @xmath70 , to adjust each pure _ theoretically _ calculated quantity to a more realistic pqcd _ model _ quantity . in this way we can take into account the sea contribution by using the sea quark distributions from parametrization , while still keep the pqcd model behaviors of the valence quark distributions .",
    "we also use cteq dis quark distribution functions as input to investigate the @xmath14 evolution of helicity distributions .",
    "the results are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : cduvsu ] .",
    "we found the ratios changed little with the increase of @xmath14 in this model as those in su(6 ) quark - diquark model .",
    "thus we have two set of quark distributions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which keeps the same valence behaviors as in the quark diquark model and pqcd based analysis prediction . in the su(6 )",
    "model , the sea quarks are unpolarized , and only valence quarks are polarized . both of these two models",
    "do not give the polarized distribution of the sea .",
    "hermes data  @xcite show that the absolute value of polarized sea quark distributions is much smaller than the absolute value of polarized valence quark distributions when @xmath73 .",
    "so it does not matter for large @xmath6 and @xmath16 if we omit terms including @xmath74 in the calculation .",
    "the @xmath14 evolution behavior of the decomposition indicates that the asymmetry changes little when calculated with distribution functions at different @xmath14 , thus the results and conclusion of this work will not influenced qualitatively by the @xmath14 evolution effect .",
    "with the definition of @xmath75 and the quark distributions , we can perform numerical calculations using different models . for the unpolarized quark distributions , we use the cteq lo parametrization  @xcite ( cteq5 set 3 ) as input for both the su(6 ) quark - spectator - diquark model and pqcd based analysis distribution functions described above .",
    "gev is taken to get quark distributions from the cteq lo parametrization , where @xmath32 is the mass of @xmath7 bosons .",
    "the polarized @xmath1-@xmath1 collisions at rhic will take place at center - of - mass energies of @xmath77  gev .",
    "so we calculate @xmath78 at @xmath79  gev and @xmath80  gev .",
    "although the production of @xmath7 at 200 gev is not feasible with the designed luminosity at rhic , we provide the calculation as a reference to show the model dependent predictions at different collision energies .",
    "results of @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ y200 ] and fig .",
    "[ y500 ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath82 are nearly equal in these two models , but @xmath83 show great difference between the two models at both the two energy scales .    as we mentioned before , @xmath57 when @xmath16 is large , which means that @xmath84 is large .",
    "we may see the difference more clearly by taking @xmath84 as the independent variable . to examine this ,",
    "we calculate @xmath85 again .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig200 ] , where @xmath79  gev , and fig .",
    "[ fig500 ] , where @xmath80  gev .",
    "the results convince us that the difference of @xmath83 in these two models comes from the different predictions on @xmath86 of the proton .",
    "we expect that experiments at rhic can give an examination .",
    "the parity - violating asymmetry in the production of @xmath7 bosons in longitudinally polarized @xmath1-@xmath1 process can be measured at rhic .",
    "it is sensitive to quark distributions of the proton .",
    "a pqcd based analysis and the su(6 ) quark - spectator - diquark model give obvious different results on the parity - violating asymmetry of @xmath3 , which is sensitive to the value of @xmath4 , a basic quantity which is difficulty to be measured in other processes .",
