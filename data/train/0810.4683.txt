    "<S> we show that the simplest stochastic epidemiological models with spatial correlations exhibit two types of oscillatory behaviour in the endemic phase . in a large parameter range , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are due to resonant amplification of stochastic fluctuations , a general mechanism first reported for predator - prey dynamics . in a narrow range of parameters that includes many infectious diseases which confer long lasting immunity </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations persist for infinite populations . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is apparent in simulations of the stochastic process in systems of variable size , and can be understood from the phase diagram of the deterministic pair approximation equations . </S>",
    "<S> the two mechanisms combined play a central role in explaining the ubiquity of oscillatory behaviour in real data and in simulation results of epidemic and other related models .    </S>",
    "<S> cycles are a very striking behaviour of prey - predator systems also seen in a variety of other host - enemy systems a case in point is the pattern of recurrent epidemics of many endemic infectious diseases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the controversy in the literature over the driving mechanisms of the pervasive noisy oscillations observed in these systems has been going on for long @xcite , because the simplest deterministic models predict damped , instead of sustained , oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> one of the aspects of this controversy is whether these mechanisms are mainly external or intrinsic , and the effects of seasonal forcing terms @xcite , @xcite and of higher order non - linear interaction terms @xcite have been explored in the framework of a purely deterministic description of well - mixed , infinite populations . </S>",
    "<S> these more elaborate models exhibit oscillatory steady states in certain parameter ranges , and have led to successful modelling when external periodic forcing is of paramount importance @xcite , but they fail to explain the widespread non - seasonal recurrent outbreaks found , for instance , in childhood infectious diseases @xcite .    during the last decade , </S>",
    "<S> important contributions have come from studies that highlight the inherently stochastic nature of population dynamics and the interaction patterns of the population as important endogenous factors of recurrence or periodicity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a general mechanism of resonant amplification of demographic stochasticity has been proposed to describe the cycling behaviour of prey - predator systems @xcite and applied recently to recurrent epidemics of childhood infectious diseases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of demographic stochasticity modelled as additive gaussian white noise of arbitrary amplitude in sustaining incidence oscillations had long been acknowledged in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty in @xcite and @xcite was that of providing an analytical description of demographic stochasticity as an internal noise term whose amplitude is determined by the parameters and the size of the system using a method originally proposed by van kampen @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to extend this approach by relaxing the homogeneous mixing assumption to include an implicit representation of spatial dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inclusion of correlations at the level of pairs leads to different quantitative and qualitative behaviours in a region of parameters that corresponds to infectious diseases which confer long lasting immunity . </S>",
    "<S> our motivation was twofold . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , the homogeneous mixing assumption is known to give poor results for lattice or network structured population @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , systematic simulations of infection on small - world networks have shown that the resonant amplification of stochastic fluctuations is significantly enhanced in the presence of spatial correlations @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , apart from stochasticity , the correlations due to the contact structure are another key ingredient to understand the patterns of recurrent epidemics . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main difficulties in including this ingredient is that the relevant network of contacts for disease propagation is not well known @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider a stochastic susceptible - infective - recovered - susceptible ( sirs ) epidemic model that leads to the ordinary pair approximation ( pa ) equations of @xcite in the thermodynamic limit as the simplest representation of the spatial correlations on an arbitrary network of fixed coordination number @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of the fluctuations around the steady state can be computed following the approach of @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effect of stochasticity and spatial correlations has been much studied through simulations , but this is an analytical treatment of a model that includes both these ingredients .    </S>",
    "<S> consider then a closed population of size @xmath1 at a given time @xmath2 , consisting of @xmath3 individuals of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 individuals of type @xmath6 , and @xmath7 individuals of type @xmath8 , modelled as network of fixed coordination number @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , in the active phase of the pa we find for small values of @xmath9 a new phase boundary [ solid blue ( black ) line ] that corresponds to a hopf bifurcation and seems to have been missed in previous studies of this model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this boundary separates the active phase with constant densities ( region i ) from an active phase with oscillatory behavior ( region ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the curve is situated at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which means that the pa model predicts sustained oscillations in the thermodynamic limit when loss of immunity is much slower than recovery from infection . according to published data for childhood infections in the pre - vaccination period @xcite , taking the average immunity waning time to be of the order of the length of the elementary education cycles at that time ( 10 years for the data points in fig . </S>",
