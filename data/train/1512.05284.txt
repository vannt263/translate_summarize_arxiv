    "@xmath3 is the lapse function , @xmath4 is the scale factor , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the newton s constant and the cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "we have also introduced a factor order ambiguity @xmath7 . in eq.@xmath8",
    "all the degrees of freedom except the scale factor @xmath9 have been integrated and matter fields have been excluded . if the wdw equation is interpreted as an eigenvalue equation , one simply finds@xmath10 namely a zero energy eigenvalue .",
    "however , it appears that the wdw equation has also a hidden structure .",
    "indeed eq.@xmath8 has the structure of a sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem with the cosmological constant interpreted as the associated eigenvalue .",
    "we recall to the reader that a sturm - liouville differential equation is defined by@xmath11 and the normalization is defined by@xmath12 where the boundary conditions are momentarily suspended .",
    "it is a standard procedure , to convert the sturm - liouville problem @xmath13 into a variational problem of the form@xmath14   = \\frac{-\\int_{a}^{b}dxy^{\\ast}\\left ( x\\right )   \\left [   \\frac{d}{dx}\\left (   p\\left (   x\\right )   \\frac{d}{dx}\\right ) + q\\left (   x\\right )   \\right ]   y\\left (   x\\right )   } { \\int_{a}^{b}dxw\\left ( x\\right )   y^{\\ast}\\left (   x\\right )   y\\left (   x\\right )   } \\,,\\label{funct}%\\ ] ] with unspecified boundary condition . if @xmath15 is an eigenfunction of @xmath13 , then@xmath16   y\\left (   x\\right )   } { \\int_{a}^{b}dxw\\left (   x\\right )   y^{\\ast}\\left ( x\\right )   y\\left (   x\\right )   } \\,,\\ ] ] is the eigenvalue , otherwise@xmath17   y\\left (   x\\right )   } { \\int_{a}^{b}dxw\\left ( x\\right )   y^{\\ast}\\left (   x\\right )   y\\left (   x\\right )   } \\,.\\ ] ] * *  * * the minimum of the functional @xmath18 $ ] corresponds to a solution of the sturm - liouville problem @xmath19 with the eigenvalue @xmath20 in the case of the flrw model we have the following correspondence@xmath21 since @xmath22 , the normalization becomes@xmath23 where it is understood that @xmath24 . in the mini - superspace approach with a flrw background , one finds@xmath25   \\psi\\left (   a\\right )   } { \\int \\mathcal{d}aa^{q+4}\\psi^{\\ast}\\left (   a\\right )   \\psi\\left (   a\\right )   } % = \\frac{3\\lambda\\pi^{2}}{4g^{2}}.\\label{wdw_1}%\\ ] ] as a concrete case , fixing @xmath26 and taking as a trial wave function @xmath27 , one finds @xmath28 when @xmath29 .",
    "then the only solution allowed is complex and therefore it must be discarded@xcite . of course , the general @xmath7 case is much more complicated@xcite .",
    "note that the global energy eigenvalue is still vanishing .",
    "what we can compute in the sturm - liouville formulation is the degree of degeneracy which is represented by the cosmological constant and the value of the cosmological constant itself . in the next section we give the general guidelines to build a sturm - liouville problem associated to the wdw equation when general relativity ( gr ) is distorted .",
    "units in which @xmath30 are used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we will give some glimpses on how the wdw is modified when we distort gr . the reference metric will be the flrw line element and we will consider modifications coming from gravity s rainbow , hl  gravity , vsl cosmology and gup deformation . we begin to consider gravity s rainbow and hl gravity",
    ".      gravity s rainbow is a distortion of the metric tensor around and beyond the planck scale@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient is the definition of two arbitrary functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which have the following property@xmath33 for a flrw metric , the deformation acts in the following way,@xmath34 where@xmath35 is the line element on the three - sphere .",
    "of course , ordinary gravity is recovered when @xmath36 . when we generalize eq.@xmath37 to include @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the equation modifies in the following way@xmath38   \\psi\\left ( a\\right )   = 0,\\label{wdwgrw}%\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath39 and defined the distorted potential as@xmath40 ^{2}a^{2}\\left [   1-\\frac{a^{2}}{a_{0}^{2}g_{2}^{2}\\left (   e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}% } \\right )   } \\right ]   ~,\\label{u(a , e)}%\\ ] ] with @xmath41 .",
    "the potential @xmath42 has been used to discuss a possible alternative explanation of the inflation problem@xcite . moreover , always in the context of the flrw space - time , it is possible to build a bridge between gravity s rainbow and hl theory@xcite . indeed ,",
    "if one considers@xmath43 with the choice@xmath44 and@xmath45   , \\ ] ] one finds that the wdw equation becomes @xmath46   \\psi\\left (   a\\right ) = 0.\\label{hhl}%\\ ] ] to obtain eq.@xmath47 , we have also defined@xmath48   \\frac{de}{da}%\\ ] ] and@xmath49   .\\ ] ] moreover , by identifying@xmath50 it is immediate to recognize that eq.@xmath47 represents the wdw equation for the projectable version of a hoava - lifshitz gravity , without detailed balanced condition .",
    "a vsl cosmology model is described by the following line element@xmath51 and where @xmath52 is an arbitrary function of time with the dimensions of a @xmath53   $ ] .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that@xmath54 where @xmath55 is a reference length scale .",
    "the form of the background is such that the shift function @xmath56 vanishes . in this case ,",
    "when @xmath57 is promoted to an operator , we can write@xmath58 where we have introduced a factor ordering ambiguity .",
    "thus the wdw equation",
    "@xmath59 simply becomes@xmath60 where we have assumed that the factor ordering is not distorted by the presence of a vsl and we have set @xmath39 .",
    "the quantum potential is defined as@xmath61 note that the potential @xmath62 vanishes in the same points where the original @xmath63 has its roots .",
    "the wdw equation deformed by a gup can be derived modifying the original undeformed momentum conjugate to the scale factor @xmath9@xmath64 into@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a coefficient with inverse momentum dimensions , in order to reestablish the correct powers .",
    "then the wdw equation for a flrw metric deformed by a gup becomes@xmath67   \\psi\\left (   a\\right )   = 0.\\ ] ] this deformation of the wdw equation prevents the existence of singularities @xcite .",
    "this is because this deformation modifies the uncertainty principle as@xmath68 thus , we obtain a minimum value for the scale factor of the universe , @xmath69 .",
    "note that the action of the gup is only on the kinetic term .",
    "in this work , we have considered the wdw equation on a flrw background and we have shown how such an equation is modified when some deviations from gr are considered . even if we have only considered a mini - superspace approach with the scale factor @xmath9 as unique degree of freedom , one has not to think that this procedure works only on a flrw background .",
    "for instance , in a series of papers@xcite , it has been shown that gravity s rainbow can keep under control uv divergences , at least to one loop .",
    "this procedure has been widely tested on a spherically symmetric background .",
    "the same procedure can be applied also to noncommutative geometries@xcite and it has been extended to include also a @xmath70 theory@xcite .",
