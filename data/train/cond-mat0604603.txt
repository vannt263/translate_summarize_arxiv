    "continuous quantum phase transitions@xcite are a subject of intense research , both in experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "particularly interesting are the low - temperature , low - energy properties near quantum critical points , which are crucially influenced by the non - trivial properties of the quantum critical ground state .",
    "a theoretical description requires the knowledge of the low - energy long - wavelength effective theory for the critical degrees of freedom .",
    "critical exponents , characterizing the power - law behavior of observables upon approaching the critical point , may then be obtained via suitable renormalization group ( rg ) techniques . a related , but considerably harder",
    ", task is the calculation of full crossover functions describing the universal behavior of observables , e.g. , along the changes that take place from the high - temperature quantum critical region to the low - temperature regimes , which appear in the vicinity of simpler ( ordered or disordered ) quantum mechanical ground states .",
    "these crossover functions are particularly relevant for experiments , as they allow to analyze measurements in terms of data collapse and universal scaling .    on theoretical side ,",
    "a large body of work has concentrated on quantum critical points above their upper critical dimension where observables can be calculated in straightforward perturbation theory , but where universality is limited due to ultraviolet ( uv ) divergencies and the absence of hyperscaling .",
    "in contrast , interacting quantum critical points below their upper critical dimension require a more sophisticated treatment , and relatively little is known regarding full crossover functions .",
    "exceptions are models for insulating magnets , with many results summarized in ref .  .    an interesting class of model systems showing quantum phase transitions , with both interacting and non - interacting critical points , are quantum impurity models .",
    "the transitions here are conceptually simpler than in bulk systems , as only a finite number of degrees of freedom becomes critical at the transition point.@xcite powerful numerical techniques , most notably wilson s numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) , have been developed to study the asymptotic low - energy regime of impurity models , and thus allow to benchmark analytical approaches . besides being model systems for fascinating many - body physics , including the kondo effect and local non - fermi liquid behavior,@xcite quantum impurity models are of great relevance for nanofabricated quantum dots as well as for correlated bulk quantum systems treated within dynamical mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft ) and its generalizations .",
    "the so - called pseudogap kondo problem@xcite displays particularly rich physics including various impurity quantum phase transition . here ,",
    "a quantum spin 1/2 couples to conduction electrons with a semi - metallic density of states ( dos ) that vanishes as @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) around the fermi level .",
    "although only special values of the pseudogap exponent @xmath2 can be experimentally accessed to date ( namely @xmath3 in metals , @xmath4 in graphene layers and @xmath5-wave superconductors , and @xmath6 in @xmath7-wave superconductors ) , this model in its generality displays a challenging variety of non - trivial properties .",
    "recently , it was realized that _ all _ critical fixed points of the pseudogap model can be accessed perturbatively after having identified the values of @xmath2 that correspond to ( upper or lower ) critical dimensions of the problem.@xcite subsequently , critical properties of the model have been analytically calculated using perturbative rg techniques .",
    "the results for various critical exponents and _ static _ observables _ at criticality _ ( such as the entropy or the anomalous curie constant ) show impressive agreement with nrg simulations.@xcite this approach illuminates the need to consider the adequate degrees of freedom to describe a given quantum phase transition ( see ref .   for a simple illustration ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the analytical approach of ref .   to the calculation of full crossover functions for static _ and _ dynamic quantities , _ both _ at and away from criticality .",
    "technically , the calculation of the scaling behavior of the physical quantities will be achieved by using the powerful callan - symanzik equations@xcite within the field - theoretic rg , allowing us to compute the universal crossovers functions of the most interesting physical observables within the renormalized theory .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the particle - hole symmetric case and to the range of the dos exponent @xmath8 , but our techniques can be applied to the particle - hole asymmetric situation@xcite near @xmath4 as well .",
    "comparison with numerical data from nrg will be made , with extremely good agreement regarding both the temperature dependence of static observables , and the zero - temperature dynamic correlation functions .",
    "with respect to the finite - temperature dynamics , it is known that direct perturbation theory displays unphysical singularities in the low - frequency regime.@xcite we show , however , that the use of callan - symanzik equations may allow some progress in obtaining physically sound results . because the regime where frequency is smaller than temperature is also notoriously hard to access via nrg simulations,@xcite our results could possibly be useful in the future for benchmarking the quality of this numerical approach . in a more general context ,",
    "we believe that the powerful methodology employed here ( being relatively unfamiliar in the condensed matter context ) will also be of interest for general studies of quantum phase transitions , e.g. , in quantum impurity models or bulk magnets .",
    "we note that some scaling functions to be determined below can also be obtained within the large-@xmath9 expansion of multichannel kondo models , both for the metallic@xcite and pseudogap@xcite density of states .",
    "in addition , a partial study of the dynamics at the critical point using renormalization ideas was undertaken in ref .  , and",
    "the local moment approach@xcite was also applied to this problem and compared to nrg.@xcite we will comment on these results in the body of the paper .",
    "the bulk of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we briefly review the physics of the pseudogap kondo model , in particular the possible quantum phase transitions and the associated observables . focusing first on the weak - coupling regime of the pseudogap kondo model , which is perturbatively controlled for small values of @xmath2 , we develop in sec .",
    "[ kondo ] the necessary formalism to compute the full universal crossovers functions of the observables , and compare the analytic results to nrg data . in sec .",
    "[ anderson ] we address the regime where @xmath2 is not small , using a previously developed effective theory,@xcite valid when @xmath2 is close to the value 1/2 .",
    "the calculation of the universal crossovers , employing the language of the anderson model , parallels the procedure used with the kondo model , and is again compared with success to the numerical data .",
    "a field - theoretic derivation t - matrix in the kondo problem is given in the appendix .",
    "in the course of the paper , some previously unaddressed technical issues will also be discussed , such as the absence of double - counting problems in renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "the pseudogap kondo problem@xcite ( for a review , see ref .  )",
    "originates from the question of how a magnetic impurity behaves when coupled to a fermionic bath with a depleted ( power - law ) single - particle spectrum at the fermi level .",
    "this question is of interest to various condensed - matter systems such as @xmath5-wave superconductors , graphene , and zero - gap semiconductors ( and is in contrast to @xmath10-wave superconductors , where there is a hard gap ) .",
    "the qualitative understanding of the pseudogap kondo problem is that kondo screening , i.e. , the quenching of the local degrees of freedom , is weakened with respect to the metallic case due to the lack of low - energy states in the bath .",
    "this results in the possibility to have quantum phase transitions controlled by the strength of the kondo coupling , the amount of particle - hole symmetry breaking and the shape of the dos . in the following",

    "we consider the kondo model with an antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath15 between the impurity and the bath : @xmath16 in standard notation . for @xmath17",
    "the model is particle - hole symmetric , and @xmath18 tunes the degree of asymmetry .",

    ". this so - called kondo limit of the anderson model , is obtained via schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite in the limit of large @xmath20 , and leads to the effective parameters of the kondo hamiltonian  ( [ hkondo ] ) : @xmath21 the particle - hole symmetric case corresponds thus to the value @xmath22 .",
    "one of the main results of the extensive numerical studies performed by gonzalez - buxton and ingersent@xcite was the generic phase diagram of the pseudogap kondo model ( as well as of the pseudogap anderson model , belonging to the same universality class ) .",
    "a subset of the results , for an intermediate value of the bath exponent @xmath2 , is displayed in fig .",

    "@xmath17 , a quantum critical point ( denoted by scr ) separates the local - moment ( lm ) phase from the strong - coupling ( ssc ) regime .",
    "the scr fixed point is expelled from the decoupled lm point as soon as @xmath2 is non zero , but collapses with the ssc point when @xmath2 reaches the value 1/2 .",
    "away from particle - hole symmetry , the transition is controlled by scr only in the range @xmath24 , and for larger values of @xmath2 , a second critical point ( denoted acr because of its intrinsic asymmetric nature ) drives the transition .",
    "[ flow]a thus corresponds to the intermediate regime @xmath25 where both critical points coexist .",
    "recently , a general understanding of this quite complex phase diagram has been reached on an analytical level,@xcite thanks to the identification of the effective theories which can be used in the various regimes of the parameter @xmath2 .    for small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the kondo model is the correct effective model to describe the phase transition between the local - moment and the strong - coupling phases . indeed",
    ", the critical scr point at @xmath26 moves towards the lm fixed point as @xmath2 goes to zero , and the quantum phase transition at particle - hole symmetry can be controlled by ( renormalized ) perturbation theory in @xmath23 within the kondo hamiltonian  ( [ hkondo ] ) , as discussed in previous works.@xcite it is important to point out that this expansion corresponds to the situation of a _ lower _ critical dimension , where the critical fixed point is located adjacent to the trivial fixed point around which the expansion is carried out ( here the `` ordered '' lm phase ) , in analogy to the renormalization flow of the non - linear sigma model above two dimensions.@xcite in principle , we would like to compute _ any _ physical quantity along the crossover from scr to lm using the rg technique  this will be done in sec .  [ kondo ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath2 approaches the value 1/2 , the critical scr point moves to strong coupling and the kondo hamiltonian is no longer amenable to a perturbative treatment .",
