    "environmental noisy forces are screened by shielding the test masses in a drag - free satellite , with precision thrusters driven by a position sensor in order to minimize the test mass - satellite relative displacement . among the residual disturbance sources ,",

    "it is crucial to obtain a test mass with very good magnetic proprieties ; for lisa the requirements are @xmath10  na m@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the test mass design calls for a 70%au-30%pt alloy , with composition chosen in order to achieve the lowest susceptibility , while retaining high density to minimize the displacement caused by a given force disturbance .",
    "the characterization of the full - sized test mass for lisa and its flight precursor ltp  @xcite , particularly important given the very stringent requirements on the magnetic cleanliness level , is made difficult with the standard magnetic characterization techniques , such as squid magnetometers and susceptometers , by its relatively large dimensions .    in this article",
    "we discuss an application of a high sensitivity torsion pendulum facility , developed for several testing of force disturbances for lisa  @xcite , to the independent characterization of both the test mass remnant moment and susceptibility , assessing these proprieties directly through the forces and torques associated with the variation of magnetic fields .",
    "in the proposed experiment we will measure with high resolution the aupt test mass remnant moment @xmath0 and susceptibility @xmath1 , by exploiting the high torque sensitivity of a torsion pendulum where the test mass is included in a light , non magnetic holder and is suspended by a thin fiber , as sketched in .",
    "the magnetic proprieties of the lisa test mass will be measured by observing the torques acting on it when subjected to a controlled oscillating field @xmath13 produced by a suitable excitation coils configuration .",
    "assuming the addition of the external , residual dc magnetic field @xmath14 , the total applied field is then @xmath15 . in order to evaluate the effect of the applied magnetic field we need to account 3 components of @xmath16 and @xmath14 , which depend on position within the test mass @xmath17 .",
    "the test mass is then modelled by meshing it into a grid of small elements with volume @xmath18 , located at the positions @xmath19 , each small enough to assume locally uniform field @xmath20 .",
    "each element @xmath21 interacting with the externally applied magnetic field is characterized by a remnant magnetic moment @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) and a susceptibility @xmath24 .",
    "the force along the @xmath4 axis acting on each test mass element can then be expressed using as a combination of a dc term @xmath25a term at the modulation frequency @xmath26 @xmath27 \\sin{\\omega_m t}\\ ] ] and a term at twice the modulation frequency @xmath28 @xmath29the torque around the vertical @xmath30 axis running through the test mass center of mass is given instead by the interaction of the horizontal ( @xmath4,@xmath31 ) projections of the remnant magnetic moment , @xmath32 , with the total applied magnetic field:@xmath33 and can be written as a combination of a dc term @xmath34 and a @xmath35 term @xmath36while the @xmath28 component vanishes because the magnetic moment induced through the susceptibility @xmath1 is parallel to the applied field .",
    "after evaluating the forces acting on each test mass element @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by , together with the torque about the @xmath30 axis @xmath39 given by , we account also for the torque arising from the net force difference at different locations within the test mass due to the remnant and induced magnetic moment : @xmath40here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the horizontal distances of the element from the torsional axis .    for given external and applied fields ,",
    "the overall torque about the @xmath30 axis @xmath43 , which the torsion pendulum is sensitive to , is then evaluated by adding the contributions from all the mass elements @xmath21 : @xmath44again , the torque can be read as the superposition of terms at dc , @xmath35 and @xmath28 .      the test mass remnant magnetic",

    "applying an oscillating magnetic field with amplitude @xmath61 10 @xmath55 t , and assuming 3 hour integration time , this noise performance yields an expected remnant moment resolution of @xmath62  pa@xmath63m@xmath11 , well below the lisa requirements .",
    "suitable flipping of the test mass within the holder will allow measurement of all components of the magnetic moment @xmath64 . to take advantage of this resolution , the remnant moment of the sample holder , without test mass , should be measured and subtracted ( typical values for torsion pendula are @xmath65  na@xmath63m@xmath11 @xcite ) .",

    "any effect from the remnant moment will not directly couple to this measurement and will appear only in @xmath73 . a realistic configuration , compatible with the dimensions of the facility vacuum vessel , is described in , and employs a relatively small coil , with symmetry axis placed away from the pendulum torsion axis . in the case of a test mass average susceptibility @xmath74 , the expected induced torque at twice the excitation frequency is shown in , and has a maximum of @xmath75  fn  m. assuming the same torque noise level and a 3 hour measurement as in , this signal amplitude will permit a resolution @xmath76 , corresponding to @xmath77% of the lisa goal .",
    "the measurement resolution grows as @xmath78 , so it is possible to effectively improve the signal to noise ratio by increasing the source coil drive current @xmath79 .",
    "however , the major uncertainty is given here by the model assumed to evaluate the magnetic field and field gradients , and thus to estimate the forces and torques .",
    "nevertheless , the power of the technique is evident because it will allow characterization of the lisa test mass directly from the torques exerted by time - depending magnetic fields , and independent estimate of the material proprieties to be compared with other characterization methods .",
    "in , due to the interaction of the test mass with the magnetic field produced by the coil in the arrangement sketched in , as a function of the displacement @xmath31 between the test mass and the coil axis .",
    "the coil parameters are : radius @xmath80  cm , @xmath81  turns , excitation current @xmath82  a , on - axis displacement @xmath83  cm ; the maximum torque is obtained with off - axis displacement @xmath84  cm.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] +",
    "the wide range of properties requested for the lisa test masses ( good optical quality to serve as end mirrors of the interferometers , stringent machining tolerances to avoid stray cross coupling , high mechanical strength to sustain the launch vibrations , high density and homogeneous composition to minimize acceleration for given force , good magnetic cleanliness ) makes its production a fundamental process within the lisa technology development .",
    "in addition , the strict requirements on the magnetic cleanliness make the verification of these proprieties a very important issue .",
    "even if a comprehensive testing campaign is planned during the preliminary phases of the flight , with the aim of establishing the `` feedthrough '' of the magnetic field fluctuations to acceleration noise  @xcite , a ground based experimental investigation of the force / torques associated with varying magnetic field is highly desirable .",
    "the torsion pendulum technique , with its widely demonstrated high torque sensitivity , can be applied to a significant characterization of the magnetic proprieties of the lisa / ltp test masses .",
    "the principle of operation , based on the coherent detection of small torques associated with modulation of external magnetic fields , is analogous to the test procedure to be employed during the flight , and thus represents an important validation step in view of the mission .",
    "work is currently in progress to modify the existing facility in order to host the proposed experiment , and modelling is being performed in order to assess the validity of the analysis and the method performance .",
