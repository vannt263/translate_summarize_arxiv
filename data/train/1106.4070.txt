    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes impose severe constraints on the soft supersymmetric breaking ( ssb ) sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the simplest way to satisfy the fcnc constraints is to adopt universality in the scalar masses at a high energy scale where the effects of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking in the hidden sector is communicated to the scalar masses of mssm via gravitational interactions .",
    "for example , in the the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) @xcite the mssm is a valid symmetry between the weak scale and grand unification scale ( @xmath3 ) at which the universality conditions are assumed to hold . in this case , the leptonic flavor violation ( lfv ) is not induced . however , in a different class of models studied in refs @xcite the universality of the scalar masses will be broken by radiative corrections .",
    "consequently , fcnc will be induced in these models as discussed below .",
    "if the universality conditions hold at the grand unification scale @xmath3 , the lfv is induced below gut scale by radiative corrections in the mssm with right - handed neutrino @xcite or susy-@xmath4 @xcite models .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to predict lfv decay rates in these models because the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are arbitrary within mssm .",
    "however , in @xmath5 gut model , we can predict the lfv decay rates below the gut scale because the dirac neutrino couplings are related to the up - type quark yukawa couplings and are thus fixed .",
    "the fcnc could also be induced above the gut scale by radiative corrections .",
    "it was shown that as a consequence of the large top yukawa coupling at the unification scale , susy guts with universality conditions valid at the scale @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , predict lepton flavor violating processes with observable rates @xcite .",
    "the experimental search for these processes provides a significant test for supersymmetric grand unification theory ( susy gut ) .",
    "both contributions of fcnc that are induced above and below @xmath3 will be studied in our model .    in this paper , the flavor violation processes for",
    "charged lepton and quark sectors are investigated in the framework of a realistic susy gut model based on the gauge group @xmath5 and a discrete non - abelian @xmath1 flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "this model is realistic because it successfully describes the fermion masses , ckm mixings and neutrino mixing angles .",
    "this work differs from other studies in several aspects .",
    "first , it is different from those based on mssm with right - handed neutrino masses or susy @xmath4 in the sense that the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are determined from the fermion masses and mixing fit of the @xmath0 model .",
    "thus , this model predicts the lepton flavor violation arising from the renormalization group ( rg ) running from @xmath3 to the right - handed neutrino mass scales .",
    "second , it is different from those based on susy @xmath5 studied in @xcite in the sense that the fcnc processes are closely tied to fermion masses and mixings",
    ". finally , in the @xmath0 model flavor violation is induced at the gut scale at which @xmath1 symmetry is broken due to large ( order one ) mixing of the third generation of mssm fields ( @xmath8 ) with the exotic heavy fields ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 runs from 1 to 3 ) .",
    "this large mixing arises when the @xmath1 flavor symmetry is broken at the gut scale .",
    "this is different from the case where the flavor violation is induced due to large top yukawa coupling at the gut scale @xcite .",
    "the reason for introducing the exotic heavy fermion fields in our model is to obtain the correct fermion mass relations at the gut scale as we shall see in section 1 .",
    "the mass scales of these exotic fields range from @xmath11 gev to @xmath12 gev depending on the values of the yukawa couplings and the scale of @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking .    in this paper",
    "we study flavor violation of the hadronic and leptonic processes by calculating the flavor violating scalar fermion mass insertion parameters @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the average mass of the relevant scalar partner of standard model fermions ( sfermions ) .",
    "all the flavor violation sources are included in our calculations .",
    "the sfermion mass insertions , @xmath16 , arise from the large mixing between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the mass insertions , @xmath17 , arise from rg running from @xmath3 to the right - handed neutrino mass scales .",
    "these scalar mass insertion parameters are analyzed in the framework of our model then they are compared with their experimental upper bounds .",
    "we found that the most stringent constraint on flavor violation comes from the @xmath2 process .",
    "this constraint requires a high degree of degeneracy of the soft masses of mssm fields and the exotic fields .",
    "therefore , in this model we assume that these soft masses are universal at the scale @xmath6 with @xmath18 , then we run them down to the gut scale . the branching ratio @xmath19 close to experimental bound ( i.e. br(@xmath2)=@xmath20 ) is obtained when the slepton masses of order @xmath21 tev , while the yukawa couplings remain perturbative at the scale @xmath6 .",
    "we also found in the framework of our model that once the constraint from @xmath19 is satisfied , all the fcnc processes will be automatically consistent with experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 1 ,",
    "we show how the fermion mass matrices are constructed in @xmath0 model . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the sources of flavor violation by finding the sfermion mass insertion parameters @xmath22 at the gut scale at which @xmath1 symmetry is assumed to be broken as well as below the gut scale .",
    "the results of the @xmath0 model regarding flavor violation analysis are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 has our conclusion .",
    "the derivation of the light fermion mass matrices and the light neutrino mass matrix after disentangling the exotic fermions is shown in appendix a. in appendix b , we list the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for various susy preserving and breaking parameters between @xmath3 and @xmath6 relevant for fcnc analysis .",
    "in the @xmath5 gauge group , all the quarks and leptons of the sm are naturally accommodated within a 16-dimensional irreducible representation .",
    "however , minimal @xmath5 ( i.e. , with only one 10-dimensional higgs representation ) leads to fermion mass relations at the gut scale , such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , that are inconsistent with experiment .",
    "this can be fixed by introducing exotic @xmath25 fermions and by coupling @xmath26 with these exotic fields via @xmath27 , which is used for @xmath5 symmetry breaking .",
    "the non - abelian discrete @xmath1 symmetry is chosen in our model because it is the smallest group that has a 3-dimensional representation , so the three generations of sm fields transform as triplet under @xmath1 .",
    "besides , fcnc is not induced in the susy-@xmath0 as long as @xmath1 symmetry is preserved . however , as we will see later , the breaking of @xmath1 symmetry at the gut scale will reintroduce the fcnc via large mixing between the exotic and light fields . based on the above reasons ,",
    "a @xmath0 model is proposed in @xcite . in this model , a minimal set of higgs representations are used to break the so(10 ) gauge group to sm gauge group so the unified gauge coupling remains perturbative all the way to the planck scale . employing this minimal higgs representation and @xmath1 symmetry ,",
    "our model successfully accommodates small mixings of the quark sector and large mixings of the neutrino sector in the unified framework as shown summarized below .",
    "the fermion mass matrices of the model proposed in @xcite were constructed approximately . in this section ,",
    "we construct these matrices by doing the algebra exactly and show that the excellent fit for fermion masses and mixings is obtained by slightly modifying the numerical values of the input parameters of ref.@xcite .",
    "there are two superpotentials of the model .",
    "the first one ( @xmath28 ) describes the couplings of the standard model fields ( @xmath29 , @xmath10 runs from 1 - 3 ) with the exotic heavy spinor - antispinor fields ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath10 runs from 1 to 3 ) , while the second one ( @xmath32 ) describes the couplings of @xmath33 with the exotic 10-vector fields ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath10 runs from 1 to 3 ) as given below : @xmath38    the above superpotentials are invariant under @xmath1 and the additional symmetry @xmath39 .",
    "the transformations of the matter fields ( i.e. , the ordinary and exotic fermion fields ) and the higgs fields under the assigned symmetry are given in table [ p3table1 ] and [ p3table2 ] .",
    ".the transformation of the matter fields under @xmath40 and @xmath41 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us analyze the four cases in the table [ p3tabr ] . in the cases ( i , ii and iii ) , the chosen values of the parameters @xmath42 are consistent with the top yukawa coupling of order @xmath43 at the gut scale and with the fitting for fermion masses and mixing . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of @xmath44 in case iv is not consistent with the fit .",
    "although the medium slepton masses of order @xmath45 gev are obtained in case i , the choice @xmath46 corresponds to non - perturbative yukawa couplings at the scale @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath47 at @xmath6 ) . in this case , the solutions of the 1-loop rges are not trusted since the yukawa couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 go non - perturbative above the gut scale . also , it is important to point out that the flavor violation constraint on @xmath2 in case iii requires heavy slepton masses ( @xmath50 tev ) while it requires slepton masses of order @xmath51 gev in case ii . in other words ,",
    "case ii is preferred in our model in the sense that the decay rate of @xmath2 is close to the experimental limit with a reasonable supersymmetric mass spectrum , so it might be tested in the ongoing meg experiment@xcite .",
    "besides , the yukawa couplings remain perturbative at the messenger scale @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ p3mu ] shows the allowed values of @xmath52 that correspond to the graphs below the @xmath53-axis for the cases i and ii .",
    "in this paper , we investigated flavor violating processes that arise below and above the gut scale in the @xmath0 model . above the gut scale , we study how flavor violation gets linked with the fitting of fermion masses and mixing through the factors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the requirement of top yukawa coupling being @xmath57 0.5 necessitates some of these factors to be large .",
    "consequently , this corresponds to an order one mixing of the light fields with the exotic heavy fields . in this case ,",
    "flavor violation is reintroduced at the gut scale where @xmath1 symmetry is broken .",
    "the stringent constraint on @xmath2 decay rate requires a high degree of degeneracy of the soft quadratic masses of the exotic heavy fields and the light fields .",
    "therefore , all the quadratic soft masses are assumed to be universal at the scale @xmath58 .",
    "flavor violation is also induced below the gut scale in the presence of right handed neutrinos through the rg running from @xmath3 to the right handed neutrino mass scales . this fv source is predicted by @xmath0 model because the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are determined from the fermion masses and mixings fitting . combining all sources of fv",
    ", we found that case i and case ii presented in table [ p3tabr ] are consistent with fermion masses and mixing fitting and with @xmath2 decay rate , which is however predicted to be close to the current experimental bound .",
    "thus the ongoing meg experiment can confirm or rule out our model .",
    "case i that corresponds to slepton mass of order 1 tev is also consistent with the yukawa couplings ( i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) being perturbative at the scale @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", these yukawa couplings do not remain perturbative at @xmath6 in case ii that corresponds to slepton masses of order @xmath45 gev .",
    "i would like to thank professor k. s. babu for reading the manuscript and valuable suggestions .",

    "in order to block - diagonalize the mass matrix of @xmath59 , we define the new orthogonal basis as @xmath60 , where y(x ) is the column matrix that contains the new(old ) eigenstates and @xmath61 is the @xmath62 orthogonal matrix ( i.e @xmath63 ) .",
