    "studies of the time and spatial variations of the fine structure constant , @xmath4 , are motivated primarily by recent observations of small variations in relativistic atomic structure in quasar absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "three data sets , containing observations of the spectra of 128 quasars continue to suggest that the fine structure constant , was smaller at redshifts @xmath5 than the current terrestrial value @xmath6 , with @xmath7 @xcite . if this interpretation of these observations proves correct then there are important consequences for our understanding of the forces of nature at low energies as well as for the question of the links between couplings in higher dimensions and the three - dimensional shadows that we observe @xcite . any slow change in the scale of the extra - dimensions",
    "would be revealed by measurable changes in our four - dimensional constants .",
    "further observational tests may help to provide independent tests of the quasar data @xcite .",
    "attempts to generalise the standard model by including scalar fields which carry the space - time variation of the fine structure constant could have important connections with the dark energy that is currently accelerating the expansion of the universe @xcite and also create potentially detectable violations of the weak equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "several theories have been proposed to investigate the implications of a varying fine structure constant. some based on grand unification theories @xcite , some with extra - dimensions @xcite , others in four dimensions @xcite and even in two dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "all these models need to satisfy the present constraints on the variations in @xmath4 .",
    "these constraints can be divided into two main groups : local and astro - cosmological .",
    "the local constraints derive from experiments in our local bound gravitational system : the oklo natural reactor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the use of an equilibrium neutron spectrum in this analyses has recently been criticised by @xcite .",
    "more realistic modelling leads to a best fit of the data to non - zero shift @xmath10 . ; the intra solar - system decay rate @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 @xcite ; and the stability of terrestrial atomic clocks @xmath14 , where @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "other limits arise from weak equivalence experiments @xcite but the limits they provide are more model dependent .",
    "in addition to the the above - mentioned positive signal from quasar absorption spectra , the astro - cosmological constraints are : the cosmic microwave background radiation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis @xmath18 , where @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "other emission - line studies @xcite give weak bounds of @xmath20 which are comparable to the earlier limits of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is a potential discrepancy between local and astro - cosmological constraints ; in particular , between the constraint of @xmath21 at redshift @xmath22 , coming from the @xmath23-decay in meteoritic samples @xcite , and the explicit variation in @xmath4 of @xmath24 at @xmath25 , coming from the low - redshift end of the quasar absorption spectra @xcite . a successful theory of varying @xmath26 needs to explain this difference . this is a challenge",
    ". models which use a very light scalar field , to drive variations in @xmath4 , need an extreme fine tuning in order to satisfy the phenomenological constraints coming from geochemical data ( oklo , @xmath23-decay ) , the present equivalent principle tests , and the quasar absorption spectra , simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the presence of the dark energy plays an important role in any potential reconciliation because in simple scalar theories @xcite any variation of @xmath4 turns off as the universe starts to accelerate .",
    "a solution to this problem was proposed by us in @xcite , where numerical simulations were shown to display behaviour for the evolution of @xmath26 inside an overdensity that differs from that in the background universe , during the formation of non - linear large - scale structures .",
    "all previous studies of the variation of constants in cosmology had neglected the effects of inhomogeneity in the universe and the fact that our local observational constraints on varying constants are made within non - expanding matter overdensities .",
    "we found that the fine structure constant evolves differently inside virialised clusters compared to the background universe .",
    "specifically , @xmath4 becomes a effectively time - independent inside a gravitationally bound overdensity after its virialisation .",
    "the fact that local @xmath4 values freeze in at virialisation , means we would observe no time variations in @xmath4 on earth , or elsewhere in our galaxy , even though time - variations in @xmath4 might still be occurring on extragalactic scales at a detectable level . for a typical galaxy cluster , the value of @xmath4 today will be the value of @xmath4 at the virialisation time of the cluster .",
    "hence , the local constraints on time variations in the fine structure constant , can easily give a value that is @xmath27 times smaller than is inferred on extra - galactic scales from quasar absorption spectra .",
    "the reason why the growth and gravitational binding of matter inhomogeneities affects the evolution of @xmath4 is simple .",
    "any varying-@xmath26 theory implies the existence of a scalar field carrying the variations in @xmath4 .",
    "this field is coupled to some selection of the matter fields , depending upon their interactions @xcite . due to this coupling , any inhomogeneities of the latter",
    "will then affect the evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is not only important in the non - linear regime of large - scale structure formation @xcite . even in the linear regime of cosmological perturbations , when these are small , @xmath28 grows and tracks @xmath29 during the dust - dominated era on scales smaller than the hubble radius @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to study the cosmological evolution of the fine structure constant taking into account a more realistic universe , where matter inhomogeneities grow and lead to the formation of bounded objects .",
    "the dependence of the fine structure constant on the density of the matter fields leads to spatial variations of @xmath4 .",
    "spatial variations imply the existence of fifth force effects .",
    "the fifth force induces an anomalous acceleration which depends on the material composition of the test particle , and so violates the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) .",
    "this is a general feature of any varying-@xmath4 theory but he magnitude of the wep violations is model dependent . in the case of the bekenstein - sandvik - barrow - magueijo ( bsbm ) model , such violations are within the current wep experiments @xcite . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that spatial variations of @xmath4 in the vicinity of compact massive objects may well be within an order of magnitude below the existing experimental bounds ( see appendix [ wepappendix ] ) .",
    "there are two main features which affect the evolution of the fine structure constant in a universe where large scale structures are formed .",
    "the most obvious , is the coupling between the scalar field , which drives variations in @xmath4 , and the matter fields .",
    "the second is the dependence of non - linear models of structure formation on the equation of state of the universe , and in particular that of the dark energy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study the dependence of @xmath26 on these two quantities in the bsbm varying-@xmath4 model .",
    "in this theory , variations in @xmath4 are driven by the electromagnetically - coupled matter fields and the effects of inhomogeneity are large . in the next section we briefly summarise the bsbm model and the spherical collapse model for the development of non - linear cosmological inhomogeneities . in section three",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the fine structure constant on the equation of state of the dark energy . in section four ,",
    "we show how spatial variations in @xmath4 may occur due to possible spatial variations in the coupling of @xmath4 to the matter fields .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section five .",
    "we will study space - time variations of @xmath4 in the bsbm theory @xcite , which assumes that the total action is given by :   @xmath30 in this varying-@xmath4 theory , the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are taken to be constant , while @xmath33 varies as a function of a real scalar field @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a coupling constant , and @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is the lagrangian of the matter fields .",
    "the gravitational lagrangian is as usual @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the ricci curvature scalar , and we have defined an auxiliary gauge potential by @xmath42 and a new maxwell field tensor by @xmath43 , so the covariant derivative takes the usual form , @xmath44 .",
    "the fine structure constant is then given by @xmath45 with @xmath46 the present value measured on earth today .",
    "the background universe will be described by a flat , homogeneous and isotropic friedmann metric with expansion scale factor @xmath47 .",
    "the universe contains pressure - free matter , of density @xmath48 @xmath49 and a dark - energy fluid with a constant equation of state parameter , @xmath50 , and an energy - density @xmath51 . in the case where dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "varying the total lagrangian , we obtain the friedmann equation ( @xmath56 ) : @xmath57where @xmath58 is the hubble rate , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the fraction of the matter which carries electric or magnetic charges . the value ( and sign ) of @xmath61 for baryonic and dark matter has been disputed @xcite .",
    "it is the difference between the percentage of mass in electrostatic and magnetostatic forms . as explained in @xcite",
    ", we can at most _ estimate _ this quantity for neutrons and protons , with @xmath62 .",
    "we may expect that for baryonic matter @xmath63 , with composition - dependent variations of the same order .",
    "the value of @xmath61 for the dark matter , for all we know , could be anything between -1 and 1 .",
    "superconducting cosmic strings , or magnetic monopoles , display a _ negative _ @xmath61 , unlike more conventional dark matter .",
    "it is clear that the only way to obtain a cosmologically increasing @xmath4 in bsbm is with @xmath64 , i.e with unusual dark matter , in which magnetic energy dominates over electrostatic energy .",
    "the term @xmath65 represents an average .",
    "however , since we are interested in the large - scale cosmological behaviour we have averaged all matter contributions into a mean effective cosmological value of @xmath66 ( see appendix [ bsbmeq ] ) . ] of the ( always positive ) energy density contribution from the non - relativistic matter which interacts electromagnetically .",
    "the scalar - field evolution equation is @xmath67    in this article , we consider that the scalar field responsible for the variations of @xmath68 is coupled to dark matter and to baryons .",
    "both species are included in the @xmath69 terms .",
    "the coupling to dark matter appears in general in any dilaton type theory , like string theory , where a scalar field is coupled to all the terms in the lagrangian , but not necessarily in the same way . in the case of bsbm models ,",
    "the coupling is motivated by certain classes of dark - matter models and their supersymmetric versions @xcite .",
    "the coupling between @xmath68 and dark - matter could permit dark - matter - photon interactions of which would be mediated by the scalar field . due to the `` invisible '' nature of dark matter , its coupling to @xmath68 is tightly constrained . in the case of bsbm models",
    "several constraints were imposed on @xmath66 in @xcite .",
    "other motivations and consequences of this coupling are investigated in @xcite , where dark - matter - photon interactions are constrained using the cmbr anisotropies and the matter power spectrum . in @xcite the cross section associated to the dark - matter - photon interaction is constraint to be @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the dark - matter - photon cross section , @xmath72 is the dark - matter particle mass and @xmath73 is the thomson cross section .",
    "since in our case @xmath74 , then an approximate constraint to the coupling between the scalar field and dark - mater can be set imposing that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . roughly giving @xmath78 , when assuming the `` usual '' @xmath79 . in this article we will use @xmath80 as a reference value . in reality , as we show in section 4 , the cosmological evolution of the fine structure constant is independent of value of @xmath81 due to a degeneracy between the initial condition for @xmath82 and the coupling to the matter fields .",
    "the independence of our results with respect to the value of @xmath83 give us the freedom to make the coupling to dark matter as small as desired .",
    "for instance , we are free to make the cross section photon - scalar field - dark matter smaller enough to satisfy all the constraints coming from the `` invisible '' nature of dark - matter . in a similar way , we are free to constraint the value of @xmath83 in order to avoid problems associated with the so called self - interacting dark matter , which could radiate and cool , due to its magnetic nature .",
    "all these features could be combined to constraint the value of @xmath66 .",
    "however that would be a lengthy and a highly model - dependent analysis , and will be considered by the authors elsewhere .      in order to study the behaviour of the fine structure constant inside overdensities we will use the spherical - infall model @xcite .",
    "this will describe how the field in the overdensity breaks away from the field in background expansion .",
    "the overdense sphere behaves like a spatially closed sub - universe .",
    "the density perturbations need not to be uniform within the sphere : any spherically symmetric perturbation will evolve within a given radius in the same way as a uniform sphere containing the same amount of mass .",
    "similar results could be obtained by performing the analysis of the bsbm theory using a spherically symmetric tolman - bondi metric for the background universe with account taken for the existence of the pressure contributed by the dark energy and the @xmath84 field . in what follows",
    ", therefore , density refers to _ mean _ density inside a given sphere .",
    "consider a spherical perturbation with constant internal density which , at an initial time , has an amplitude @xmath85 and @xmath86 . at early times",
    "the sphere expands along with the background .",
    "for a sufficiently large @xmath87 gravity prevents the sphere from expanding .",
    "three characteristic phases can then be identified .",
    "_ turnaround _ : the sphere breaks away from the general expansion and reaches a maximum radius .",
    "_ collapse _ : if only gravity is significant , the sphere will then collapse towards a central singularity where the densities of the matter fields would formally go to infinity . in practice ,",
    "pressure and dissipative physics intervene well before this singularity is reached and convert the kinetic energy of collapse into random motions .",
    "_ virialisation _ : dynamical equilibrium is reached and the system becomes stationary : there are no more time variations in the radius of the system , @xmath88 , or in its energy components .",
    "this phase determines the final pattern of variations in @xmath89 which becomes a constant inside the virialised region , otherwise the system would be unable to virialise @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , depending upon the equation of state of the dominant matter field , @xmath4 can continue to change in the cosmological background .",
    "behaviour naturally creates a situation where time variation of @xmath4 on large cosmological scales is accompanied by unchanging behaviour locally within galaxies and our solar system .",
    "it would explain the apparent discrepancy between the results of the quasars absorption spectra observations and the @xmath23-decay rate deductions from meteorite data @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a spherical overdense patch of scale radius @xmath90 is given by the friedmann acceleration equation : @xmath91where @xmath92 is the density of cold dark matter in the cluster , @xmath93 is the energy density of the dark energy inside the cluster and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 represents the scalar field inside the overdensity .",
    "we have also used the equations of state @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    in the cluster ,",
    "the evolutions of @xmath99 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given by @xmath100    we will evolve the spherical overdensity from high redshift until its virialisation occurs . according to the virial theorem , equilibrium will be reached when @xmath101 ; @xmath102 , is the average total kinetic energy , and @xmath103 is the average total potential energy in the sphere . note that we obtain the usual @xmath104 condition , for any potential with a power - law form ( @xmath105 ) , which includes our case .",
    "it is useful to write the condition for virialisation to occur in terms of the potential energies associated the different components of the overdensity .",
    "the potential energy for a given component @xmath106 can be calculated from its general form in a spherical region : @xmath107where @xmath108 is the total energy density inside the sphere , @xmath109 is the gravitational potential due to the @xmath110 density component .    in the case of a @xmath111 model ,",
    "the potential energies inside the cluster are : @xmath112where @xmath113 is the potential energy associated with the uniform spherical overdensity , @xmath114 is the potential associated with @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the potential associated with @xmath117 @xmath118 is the cluster mass , with @xmath119    the virial theorem will be satisfied when @xmath120where @xmath121 @xmath122 is the total kinetic energy at virialisation and @xmath123 is the mean - square velocity of the components of the cluster .    using the virial theorem ( [ virial ] ) and energy conservation at the turnaround and cluster virialisation times",
    ", we obtain an equilibrium condition only in terms of the potential energies : @xmath124where @xmath125 is the redshift of virialisation and @xmath126 is the redshift at the turnaround of the over - density at its maximum radius , when @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in the case where @xmath129 and @xmath130 we reduce to the usual virialisation condition for @xmath111 models with no variation of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the generalisation from the cosmological constant case to a dark - energy fluid with a general equation of state @xmath131 is straightforward .",
    "one just needs to note that the potential energy associated to the dark - energy fluid is @xmath132where @xmath133 is mass associated of that fluid , which is given by @xmath134      the behaviour of the fine structure constant during the evolution of a cluster can now be obtained numerically by evolving the background friedmann equations ( [ fried1 ] ) and ( [ psidot ] ) together with the cluster evolution equations ( [ rcluster1])-([dark1 ] ) until the virialisation condition holds . in order to satisfy the constraints imposed by the observations , we need to set up initial conditions for the evolution . since the earth is now inside a virialised overdense region , the initial condition for @xmath84",
    "is chosen so as to obtain our measured laboratory value of @xmath26 at virialisation , @xmath135 .",
    "but , since the redshift at which our cluster has virialised is uncertain , we will choose a representative example where virialisation occurs over the range @xmath136 .",
    "this is just for illustrative purposes , since in reality , the initial condition for @xmath84 needs to be fixed only once , for our galaxy .",
    "hence , @xmath4 in other clusters will have a lower or higher value ( with respect to @xmath46 ) depending on their @xmath125 values .",
    "after we have set @xmath125 for earth , another constraint we need to satisfy is given by the quasar observations @xcite .",
    "this means that when comparing the value of the fine structure constant on earth , at its virialisation , @xmath137 , with the value of the fine structure constant of another region at some given redshift in the range accessed by the quasar spectra , @xmath138 , we need to obtain @xmath139 .",
    "this raises the question as to the location of the clouds where the quasar absorption lines are formed : are they in a region which should be considered as part of the background or in an overdensity with somewhat lower contrast than exists in our galaxy ? unfortunately , this question can not be answered because we do not know the density of the clouds , only the column density . nevertheless , these clouds are much less dense than the solar system . because of this , it is a very good approximation to assume that the clouds possess the background density .",
    "thus , the initial conditions for @xmath84 are chosen so as to obtain our measured laboratory value of @xmath4 at virialisation @xmath140 and to match the latest observations for background regions at @xmath141 .    here",
    "we may also wonder about possible measurements of @xmath4 in lyman - alpha systems and whether similar considerations should be applied because of local variations in density compared to this in the solar system . assuming that the density of the lyman - alpha systems are much smaller than the earth",
    ", we would expect to find a difference in @xmath68 with respect to the value measured on earth .",
    "this difference could even be of the same order as the one found in the quasar spectra . however , this is dependent on the density of the clouds and redshift we are making the measurements .",
    "unfortunately we do not know the local density , only the column density along the line of sight . in order to make some numerical predictions",
    ", we would need to create a model populated with clouds of different density but there are too many variables to make a reliable estimate of the effects at present . in the future it may be possible , with the accumulation of very large archives of data , to exploit the known differences in column density in the different types of system where the absorption lines are forms to search for correlations with column density . the damped lyman - alpha and lyman - limit systems in the quasar absorption - system data sets have column densities of order or exceeding @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "again , rigorous exploitation of any perceived systematic trend in alpha between systems of different column density would require the construction of a hi density model in the vicinity of the absorption system .",
    "non - linear models of structure formation will present different features depending on the equation of state of the universe @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the way the parameter @xmath144 evolves with the redshift .",
    "the evolution of @xmath145 depends on the equation of state of the dark - energy component which dominates the expansion dynamics .",
    "for instance , in a @xmath111 model , the density contrast , @xmath146 increases as the redshift decreases . at high redshifts , the density contrast at virialisation becomes asymptotically constant in standard ( @xmath147 ) @xmath1 , with @xmath148 at collapse or @xmath149 at virialisation .",
    "this behaviour is common to other dark - energy models of structure formation ( @xmath2 ) , where the major difference is in the magnitude and the rate of change of @xmath146 at low redshifts .",
    "the local value of the fine structure constant will be a function of the redshift and will be dependent on the density of the region of the universe we measure it , according to whether it is in the background or an overdensity @xcite .",
    "the density contrast of the virialised clusters depends on the dark - energy equation of state parameter , @xmath131 . hence , the evolution of @xmath4 will be dependent on @xmath131 as well .",
    "what difference we would expect to see in @xmath4 if we compared two bound systems , like two clusters of galaxies ? and how does the difference depend on the cosmological model of structure formation ?",
    "these questions can be answered by looking at the time and spatial variations of @xmath4 at the time of virialisation .",
    "the space variations will be tracked using a spatial density contrast , @xmath150which is computed at virialisation ( where @xmath151 ) .",
    "we assume there are no changes after this time .",
    "since the main dependence of @xmath4 is on the density of the clusters and the redshift of virialisation , we will only study dark - energy models where @xmath152 is a constant .",
    "any effect contributed by a time - varying equation of state should be negligible , since the important feature is the average equation of state of the universe",
    ". this may not be the case for the models where the scalar field responsible for the variations in @xmath4 is coupled to dark energy @xcite .    in order to have a qualitative behaviour of the evolution of the fine structure constant , at the virialisation of an overdensity",
    ", we will then compare the standard cold dark matter model , @xmath3 , to the dark - energy cold dark matter , @xmath2 , models .",
    "in particular , we will examine the representative cases of @xmath153 .",
    "all models will be normalised to have @xmath137 at @xmath154 and to satisfy the quasar observations @xcite , as discussed above .",
    "this normalisation , although unrealistic ( earth did not virialise today ) , give us some indication of the dependence of the time and spatial evolution in @xmath26 on the different models . in reality",
    ", this approximation will not affect the order of magnitude of the spatial and time variations in @xmath4 for the cases of virialisation at low redshift @xcite .",
    "the final value of @xmath4 inside virialised overdensities and its evolution in the background is shown in figures [ modelsvirial ] and modelsvirialback , respectively . from these plots , a feature common to all the models stands out : the fine structure constant in the background regions has a lower value than inside the virialised overdensities .",
    "also , its eventual local value depends on the redshift at which the overdensity virialises .",
    "as expected , the equation of state of the dark energy affects the evolution of @xmath89 both in the overdensities and the background .",
    "a major difference arises if we compare the @xmath3 and @xmath2 models . in a @xmath3 model ,",
    "the fine structure constant is always a growing function , both in the background and inside the overdensities , and the growth rate is almost constant . in a @xmath2 model , the evolution of @xmath4 will depend strongly on whether one is inside a cluster or in the background . in the @xmath2 background",
    ", @xmath156 becomes constant ( independent of the redshift ) as the universe enters the phase of accelerated expansion . inside the clusters , @xmath157 will always grow and its value now will depend on the redshift at which virialisation occurred .",
    "the cumulative effect of this growth increases as we consider overdensities which virialise at increasingly lower redshift .",
    "these differences arise due to the dependence of the fine structure constant on the equation of state of the universe and the density of the regions we are measuring it . in a @xmath3 model",
    ", we will always live in a dust - dominated era .",
    "the fine structure constant will then be an ever - increasing logarithmic function of time , @xmath158 bsbm , mota1 .",
    "the growth rates of @xmath156 and @xmath159 will be constant , since @xmath146 is independent of the redshift in a @xmath3 model . in a @xmath2 model ,",
    "dark energy plays an important role at low redshifts . as we reach low redshifts",
    ", where dark energy dominates the universal expansion , @xmath156 becomes a constant @xcite , but @xmath146 continues to increase , as will @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the growth of @xmath157 becomes steeper as we go from a dark - energy fluid with @xmath160 to the @xmath52-like case of @xmath55 .",
    "the intermediate situation is where @xmath161 , due to the dependence of @xmath146 on @xmath131 .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn with respect to the time shift of the fine structure constant , ( @xmath162 ) , at virialisation , see figures [ modelsdeltatimevirial ] and [ modelsdeltatimevirialback ] .",
    "spatial variations in @xmath4 will be dramatically different when comparing the standard @xmath1 model with the @xmath2 models .",
    "in the @xmath3 model , the difference between the fine structure constant in a virialised cluster ( @xmath157 ) and in the background ( @xmath156 ) will always be the same , @xmath164 , independently of the redshift at which we measure it , figure [ modelsdeltaa ] .",
    "again , this is because , in a @xmath3 model , @xmath146 is always a constant independent of the redshift at which virialisation occurs .",
    "the constancy of @xmath165 is a signature of the @xmath3 structure - formation model , and it may even provide a means to rule out the @xmath166 model completely if , when comparing the value of @xmath167 in two different clusters , we do not find the same value , independently of @xmath125 .",
    "a similar result is found for the case of a dark - energy structure formation model at high redshifts where @xmath165 will be constant .",
    "this behaviour is expected since at high redshift any @xmath2 model is asymptotically equivalent to standard @xmath1 .",
    "as expected , it is at low redshifts that the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath166 emerges .",
    "when comparing virialised regions at low redshifts , @xmath168 will increase in a @xmath2 model as we approach @xmath154 .",
    "this is due to an increase of the density contrast of the virialised regions , @xmath145 , and the approach to a constant value of @xmath156 , see figure [ modelsdeltarho ] .",
    "in general , the growth will be steeper for smaller values of @xmath131 , although there will be parameter degeneracies between the behaviour of different models , which ensure that there is no simple relation between @xmath169 and the dark - energy equation of state .",
    "note that , independently of the structure formation model we use , @xmath170 at virialisation is always a decreasing function of time , as shown in figure [ modelspsidot ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath4 in the background and inside clusters depends mainly on the dominant equation of state of the universe and the _ sign _ of the coupling constant @xmath171 which is determined by the theory and the dark matter s identity .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , @xmath156 will be nearly constant for an accelerated expansion and also during the radiation era far from the initial singularity ( where the kinetic term , @xmath172 , can dominate ) .",
    "_ _  _ _ slow evolution of @xmath4 will occur during the dust - dominated epoch , where @xmath4 increases logarithmically in time for @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath61 is negative , @xmath4 will be a slowly growing function of time but @xmath4 will fall rapidly ( even during a curvature - dominated era ) for @xmath61 positive @xcite .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for the evolution of the fine structure constant inside overdensities .",
    "thus , we see that a slow change in @xmath4 , cut off by the accelerated expansion at low redshift , that may be required by the data , demands that @xmath64 in the cosmological background .    the sign of @xmath61 is determined by the physical character of the matter that carries electromagnetic coupling . if it is dominated by magnetic energy then @xmath64 , if not then @xmath173 baryons will usually have a positive @xmath61 ( although bekenstein has argued for negative baryonic @xmath174 in ref .",
    "@xcite , but see @xcite ) , in particular @xmath175 for neutrons and protons .",
    "dark matter may have negative values of @xmath61 , for instance superconducting cosmic strings have@xmath176 .    in the previous section ,",
    "we have chosen the sign of @xmath61 to be negative so @xmath4 is a slowly - growing function in time during the era of dust domination .",
    "this was done in order to match the latest observations which suggest that @xmath4 had a smaller value in the past @xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation , since we have been studying the cosmological evolution of @xmath4 during large - scale structure formation , when dark matter dominates .",
    "however , we know that on sufficiently small scales the dark matter will become dominated by a baryonic contribution for which @xmath173 the transition in the dominant form of total density , from non - baryonic to baryonic as one goes from large to small scales requires a significant evolution in the magnitude and sign of @xmath177",
    ". this inhomogeneity will create distinctive behaviours in the evolution of the fine structure constant and will be studied in more elsewhere .",
    "it is clear that a change in the sign of @xmath178 will lead to a completely different type of evolution for @xmath4 , although the expected variations in the sign of @xmath177 will occur on scales much smaller than those to which we are applying the spherical collapse model here .",
    "hence , we will only investigate the effects of changing the absolute value of the coupling , @xmath179 , for the evolution of the fine structure constant.    from figure [ zetasalphacb ] it is clear that the rate of changes in @xmath180 and @xmath159 will be functions of the absolute value of @xmath181 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath179 lead to a slower variation of @xmath4 .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for the time variations in @xmath162 , see figure [ zetasalphacbback ] .",
    "the faster variation in @xmath4 and @xmath162 for higher values of @xmath179 is also a common feature for @xmath167 , see figure [ zetasdeltaa ] .",
    "this is expected .",
    "a stronger coupling to the matter fields would naturally lead to a stronger dependence on the matter inhomogeneities , and in particular on their density contrast , @xmath145 .    in reality , the dependence of @xmath4 on the coupling @xmath177 has a degeneracy with respect to the initial condition chosen for @xmath84 .",
    "this is clear from the scale invariance of equation ( [ psidot ] ) under linear shifts in the value of @xmath182 and rescaling of @xmath181 and @xmath183 .",
    "it is always possible , to obtain the same evolution ( and rate of change ) of @xmath4 and @xmath162 for any other value of @xmath179 ; see for example tables [ zeta1],[zeta4],[zeta6 ] and [ zeta10 ] , where we have tabulated the shifts @xmath184 and time change , @xmath185 obtained in the clusters and in the background for various numerical choices of @xmath177 and virialisation redshift @xmath125 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     variations in @xmath4 also depend on the value and sign of the coupling , @xmath181 , of the scalar field responsible for variations in @xmath4 , to the matter fields .",
    "a higher value of @xmath179 , leads to a stronger dependence on the density contrast of the matter inhomogeneities . if the value or sign of @xmath177 changes in space , then spatial inhomogeneities in @xmath4 occur .",
    "this could happen if we take into account that on small enough scales , baryons will dominate the dark matter density .",
    "the sign and value of @xmath177 will change , and variations in @xmath4 will evolve differently on different scales",
    ". if there are no variations in the sign and value of @xmath177 , then the only spatial variations in @xmath4 are the ones resulting from the dependence of the fine structure constant on the density contrast of the region in which one is measuring @xmath4 . at first sight",
    ", one might conclude that the difference between @xmath159 and @xmath156 , is only a consequence of the coupling of @xmath4 to matter .",
    "in reality this is not so .",
    "it is always possible to obtain the same results for any value @xmath179 with a suitable choice of initial conditions , as can be seen from the results in tables [ zeta1 ] , [ zeta4 ] , [ zeta6 ] and [ zeta10 ] .",
    "the results of this paper offer a natural explanation for why any experiment carried out on earth @xcite , or in our local solar system @xcite , gives constraints on possible time - variation in @xmath26 that are much stronger than the magnitude of variation that is consistent with the quasar observations @xcite on extragalactic scales .",
    "the value of the fine structure constant on earth , and most probably in our local cluster , differs from that in the background universe because of the different histories of these regions .",
    "it can be seen from the tables [ darkscdm ] , [ darkw6cdm ] , [ darkw8cdm ] and [ darklcdm ] that inside a virialised overdensity we expect @xmath186 for @xmath187 while in the background we have @xmath188 , independently of the structure formation model used .",
    "the same conclusions arise independently of the absolute value of the coupling @xmath177 , see tables [ zeta1 ] , [ zeta4 ] , zeta6 and [ zeta10 ] .",
    "the dependence of @xmath4 on the matter - field perturbations is much less important when one is studying effects of varying @xmath4 on the early universe , for example on the last scattering of the cmb or the course of primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite . in the linear regime of the cosmological perturbations , small perturbations in @xmath4",
    "will decay or become constant in the radiation era @xcite . at the redshift of last scattering , @xmath189 ,",
    "it was found in @xcite that @xmath190 . in the background , the fine structure constant ,",
    "will be a constant during the radiation era @xcite so long as the kinetic term is negligible .",
    "a growth in value of @xmath4 will occur only in the matter - dominated era @xcite .",
    "hence , the early - universe constraints , coming from the cmb and primordial nucleosynthesis , are comparatively weak , @xmath191 , and are easily satisfied .",
    "we would like to thank c. van de bruck , m. murphy , k. subramanian and j.k .",

    "from the bsbm action ( [ s ] ) the equation of motion for @xmath82 comes @xmath192 the right - hand - side ( rhs ) of equation ( [ psikg ] ) represents a source term for @xmath82 , which includes all the matter fields which are coupled to it .",
    "these include not only relativistic matter ( like photons ) , but as well as non - relativistic one that interact electromagnetically .",
    "it is clear that @xmath193 , vanishes for a sea of pure radiation since @xmath194 .",
    "the only significant contribution to a variation in @xmath82 comes from nearly pure electrostatic or magnetostatic energy associated to non - relativistic particles . in order to make quantitative predictions",
    "we then need to know how much of the non - relativistic matter contributes to the right - hand - side ( rhs ) of equation ( [ psikg ] ) .",
    "this can be parametrised by the ratio @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the energy density of the non - relativistic matter .",
    "this non - relativistic matter , which interact electromagnetically , contributes to the friedman equation ( [ fried1 ] ) as @xmath197 .    for protons and neutrons , @xmath66 can be estimated from the electromagnetic corrections to the nucleon mass , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this correction contains the @xmath200 contribution , which is always positive , and also term of the form @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the quarks current @xcite .",
    "hence we take a guidance value of @xmath203 for protons and neutrons .    using the parameter @xmath66 , the fraction of electric and magnetic energies",
    "may then be written as @xcite : @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 are the electric and magnetic energies respectively . using ( [ zetas ] ) in equation ( [ psikg ] ) we have @xcite @xmath207 since we are interested in the cosmological evolution of @xmath68 , instead of using both parameters @xmath208 and @xmath209 , we will use throughout this articles , the cosmological parameter , @xmath66 , defined as @xmath210 , which in the limit where @xmath211 is positive , and when @xmath212 is negative .",
    "note that , the cosmological value of @xmath66 has to be weighted , not only by the electromagnetic - interacting baryon fraction , but also by the fraction of matter that is non - baryonic . hence the value and sign of @xmath66 depends strongly on the nature of dark matter to which the field @xmath82 might be coupled .",
    "in bsbm the test - particle lagrangian may be split as @xmath213 .",
    "variation with respect to the metric leads to a similar split of the stress - energy tensor , producing an energy density of the form @xmath214 and so a mass of @xmath215 ( assuming electric fields dominate ) . in order to preserve their ratios of @xmath216 test particles",
    "may thus be represented by @xcite @xmath217^{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\delta ( x - y)}{\\sqrt{-g% } } } \\]]where over - dots are derivatives with respect to the proper time @xmath218 .",
    "this leads to equations of motion : @xmath219which in the non - relativistic limit ( with @xmath220 ) reduce to @xmath221where @xmath222 is the gravitational potential .",
    "thus we predict an anomalous acceleration : @xmath223violations of the wep occur because @xmath224 is substance dependent . for two test bodies with @xmath225 and @xmath226",
    "the etvs parameter is : @xmath227this can be written more conveniently as the product of the following 3 factors @xcite : @xmath228where @xmath229 denotes earth .",
    "if we take @xmath230 then for typical substances the first factor is @xmath231 . in order to satisfy the existing wep violations experimental bounds @xcite",
    ", we need to `` play around '' with the two last terms of equation ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "if we use the value assumed in @xcite @xmath232 .",
    "hence , we need @xmath233 to produce @xmath234 just an order of magnitude below existing experimental bounds .",
    "if we instead use @xmath235 we would need @xmath236 to satisfy the same experimental bounds .",
    "the choice in the value of @xmath83 just depends on the nature of dark - matter , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in this paper , any choice of @xmath237 will give us the same cosmological behaviour for @xmath238 due to a degeneracy with the initial conditions for @xmath82 .",
