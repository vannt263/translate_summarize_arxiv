    ". a generalization for general 3-manifolds of the mentioned result of @xcite could be applied for giving a complete answer to fenn s question .      the minimal number of triple points of filling dehn surfaces of a 3-manifold @xmath1 satisfying some particular property can be in some cases a topological invariant of @xmath1 .",
    "we define the _ triple point number _ @xmath563 of a closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath1 as the minimal number of triple points of all its filling dehn surfaces and the _ genus _ @xmath59 _ _  triple point number _ _ @xmath564 of @xmath1 as the minimal number of triple points of all its genus @xmath59 filling dehn surfaces .",
    "the ordered collection @xmath565 of all the genus @xmath59 triple point numbers of the 3-manifold @xmath1 for all @xmath566 is what we call the _",
    "triple point spectrum _ @xmath567 of @xmath1 .",
    "we can make similar definitions imposing topological restrictions on the filling dehn surfaces considered .",
    "for example , we can define the _ nulhomotopic triple point number _ of @xmath1 as the minimal number of triple points of all its nulhomotopic filling dehn surfaces , and in a similar way the _ nulhomotopic genus _",
    "_  triple point number _ _ or the _ nulhomotopic triple point spectrum _ can be defined .",
    "all of them are topological invariants of the 3-manifold and give a measure of the _ _  complexity _ _ of the manifold in the same way as the heegaard genus , for example .",
    "if we have a filling dehn surface @xmath0 in a 3-manifold , using pipings as that of figure [ fig23b ] , perhaps we can reduce the number of triple points of @xmath0 , but increasing the genus of the filling dehn surface .",
    "so there is some relation between the different genus @xmath59 triple point numbers that would be interesting to clarify .    any dehn sphere in a closed orientable 3-manifold has an even number of triple points ( @xcite , p. 105 )",
    "this is not the case for genus @xmath568 dehn surfaces , as it can be seen in the example given by figure [ fig32a ] .",
    "this means that if we want a set of moves for relating _ all _ dehn surfaces ( of any genus ) of any 3-manifold , the homma - nagase moves introduced here , together with pipings , do not suffice because all of them are operations that preserve the parity of the number of triple points .",
    "we define that a genus @xmath59 filling dehn surface @xmath0 of a 3-manifold @xmath1 is _ minimal _ if there is no other genus @xmath59 filling dehn surface of @xmath137 with less triple points than @xmath0 .",
    "minimal filling dehn surfaces , in particular minimal filling dehn spheres , should have interesting properties , and their classification is another interesting problem .",
    "the classification of minimal dehn spheres has been solved for @xmath342 in @xcite . in that work",
    ", a. shima gives in a different context six examples of dehn spheres in @xmath342 with only 2 triple points .",
    "three of these six examples fill @xmath342 ( one of them is johansson s sphere of figure [ fig29a ] ) and they are minimal because , as we have said , any filling dehn sphere must have at least 2 triple points .",
    "it can be deduced by the main theorem of @xcite that these three examples are the unique possible minimal filling dehn spheres in @xmath342 .",
    "finally , we want to introduce a later definition .",
    "we say that a filling dehn surface @xmath0 in a 3-manifold @xmath1 is _ irreducible _ if the only allowable filling preserving moves on @xmath0 are finger move + 1 or + 2 .",
    "that is , @xmath0 is irreducible if any dehn surface @xmath90 which can be obtained performing a filling - preserving move on @xmath0 has more triple points than @xmath0 .",
    "johansson s sphere is not irreducible , while example 1.3 of @xcite is irreducible .",
    "this means that minimality does not imply irreducibility .",
    "we are interested also in the converse question : are there examples of non - minimal irreducible filling dehn surfaces ?"
