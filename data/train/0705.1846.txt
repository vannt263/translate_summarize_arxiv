    "over the last 10 or 12 years a great deal of outstanding observational work has indicated that the best fit model of our universe is a nearly flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model with @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( riess _ et al .",

    "this remarkable concordance is based on wmap cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurements , a large number of supernovae ia data ( see riess _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , and large scale structure studies , and has been confirmed by other more recent work .",
    "riess and his collaborators ( riess _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , for instance , have recently found a best - fit cosmology having @xmath15 and @xmath16 for their sample of 16 distant ( @xmath17 ) sn ia , including 6 with @xmath18 , assuming the universe is exactly flat . within the errors",
    "this is consonant with the `` concordance '' model given above .",
    "+ despite the strength of these results , they will obviously have to undergo gradual revision and continual verification , as more precise data from higher redshifts are acquired .",
    "when @xmath5 , there are at present , from a strictly mathematical consideration of the einstein field equations , not yet enough completely independent observables to constrain all the free parameters of the cosmological model ( hellaby , 2006 ; stoeger & hellaby , in preparation ) . + assuming that the universe is spherically symmetric on the largest scales ( flrw or , more generally , lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) ) , one generally needs redshifts , luminosity distances ( or angular - diameter distances ) , and galaxy number counts , together with a reliable galaxy evolution model , or an equivalent set of measurements , to constrain the model fully ( see ellis , _ et al . _ 1985 ) . if @xmath5 , however , or if there is some other form of dark energy , these data are not enough .",
    "we need at least one other independent parameter  that is , independent of the observables we have just mentioned and therefore of those which depend upon them . and , strictly speaking , this is what we have not had .",
    "thus , the impressive fittings that have led to the concordance model are still model - dependent in some sense .",
    "+ there is another pair of such independent observables",
    ". these would improve and verify our cosmological fitting , when we are able to obtain an adequate number of precise luminosity distances  or angular - diameter distances  and redshifts for sn ia , or for other standard candles or standard rods , out to @xmath19 .",
    "these observables are the maximum of the angular - diameter distance ( or observer - area distance ) @xmath8 and the redshift @xmath7 at which it occurs .",
    "it has been realized for many years ( mccrea 1935 , hoyle 1961 , ellis & tivon 1985 ) that this distance reaches a maximum for relatively low redshifts in flrw universes . for an einstein - desitter ( @xmath20)universe filled with matter , for instance",
    ", the observer area distance c has a maximum @xmath8 at @xmath21 .",
    "this effect is due to the global gravitational focusing of light rays caused by the matter in the universe  in effect the entire universe , filled with homogeneously distributed matter , acts like a gravitational lens .",
    "+ krauss and schramm ( 1993 ) recognized that , for flat flrw universes , determination of @xmath7 would give us @xmath9 .",
    "they plotted and provided a table giving this unique correspondence ( see their table 1 ) , and proposed the possibility of using the measurement of compact parsec - scale radio jets to observationally exploit it , if the source - evolution problem can be tamed .",
    "since then , there has been little development or discussion of this potentially important connection  except for hellaby s ( 2006 ) recent closely connected exploration of such measurements within the more general context of ltb universes ( see below ) .",
    "certainly , it is implicit in the friedmann equation ",
    "most clearly in refsdal , _ et al . _ s ( 1967 ) numerical results of general cosmological models , in the brief treatment of cosmic distances by carroll , _ et al . _ ,",
    "1992 ( see pages 510 - 512 , and their figure 5 ) , and in peeble s treatment of angular diameters in cosmology ( peebles 1993 ) , but not pointed out or discussed further , until hellaby s more general treatment",
    ". this may be partially due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable data at the redshifts where we would expect to locate @xmath8 ( see below ) .",
    "now , however , there is the very real prospect of obtaining angular diameter distances ( indirectly , by measuring luminosity distances of sn ia ) out to @xmath19 using telescopes in space .",
    "thus , it is important to point out again and stress this promising connection , which could eventually be incorporated in the bayesian - fisher matrix ( see , for example , albrecht , _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) fitting of models to data , or be used as an independent consistency check on such fittings .",
    "+ recently , as already mentioned , hellaby ( 2006 ) emphasized the importance of such a measurement within a more general framework .",
    "he points out that in any ltb cosmology with @xmath6 ( which includes all @xmath6 flrw cosmologies as special cases ) the measurement of @xmath8 is equivalent to a measurement of the total mass @xmath22 within the sphere defined by @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath5 we have for any ltb model , instead , a simple relationship between the @xmath14 , @xmath8 and @xmath22 ( see equation ( 11 ) below ) . so a measurement of @xmath22 , or its equivalent , and @xmath8 determines @xmath14 .",
    "what becomes apparent is that @xmath8 and the redshift @xmath7 at which it occurs constitute independent cosmological observables  directly constraining @xmath14 and @xmath11 ( see hellaby s figure a1 in his appendix , which shows how different cosmologcal parameters vary with @xmath7 . ) + applying this directly to flat flrw models , like those we have good evidence represent our universe , we quickly see that , since we implicitly have a relation between the total mass - energy density and the matter density , or equivalently between the matter density and @xmath9  i.e. @xmath23  observational determination of @xmath7 will directly determine @xmath9 in a very simple and straightforward way , supporting krauss and schramm s results ( 1993 ) . in this paper",
    "we shall integrate and generalize these results , first of all verifying krauss and schramm s results for flat flrw universes and writing down that relationship as an algebraic equation in closed form ( they presented their results numerically ) , and then generalizing those results to non - flat flrw universes , using the relationship hellaby ( 2006 ) noticed . in this case ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath7 directly determine both @xmath9 and @xmath11 , if we know @xmath10 independently . in the course of doing this , we shall , as useful and important by - products , obtain the flrw @xmath3 and @xmath4 closed - form functional relationships for @xmath5 universes , parallel to those which are well - known for @xmath6 flrw models ( ellis and stoeger 1987 ; stoeger , _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , as well as a very simple observational criterion for flatness in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath24 , of course , is simply the angular - diameter distance as a function of the redshift @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the mass density per source counted as a function of @xmath25 , which is closely related to the differential galaxy number counts @xmath27 ( see stoeger , et al .",
    "1992 ) . to our knowledge , these more general results , along with the closed - form expressions and the flatness criterion are new .",
    "+ we have already indicated that these measurements will be able to be implemented once we have luminosity distances and redshifts for sn ia , or for other standard candles or standard rods , in the interval @xmath2 . as we shall show , it is precisely in this region that a flat flrw universe will have a maximum in its angular - diameter distance , if @xmath28 . for the best fit flrw given by riess _",
    "( 2004 ) with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath29 .",
    "another potential way of obtaining such precise measurements is  following krauss and schramm s ( 1993 ) idea  the use of vlbi to determine the angular - size / redshift relation for ultra - compact ( milliarcsecond ) radio sources .",
    "these have been argued to be standard rods ( jackson and dodgson 1997 ; jackson 2004 ) .",
    "if we actually do find the maximum angular - diameter distance near this value of the redshift , this would be independent confirmation of the concordance model .",
    "if we do not , but find the maximum angular - diameter distance @xmath30 at some other value of @xmath25 , this will require further work at reconciling the models , and possibly modifying them . in that case , either the universe may still be flat , but the relative amounts of matter and dark energy would be quite different from that given by the concordance , or there is a significant deviation from flatness that must be taken into account , or possibly there are significant deviations from flrw on the largest scales which must be included  or all three ! at the very least , this would be a good consistency check on our cosmological fitting so far . alternatively , as we have already mentioned , we could simply include both @xmath8 and @xmath7 data in our over - all fitting scheme  which would further improve the relibility of our results . + it is important to point out that this redshift range is already attracting special attention .",
    "that is because there have been preliminary indications ( gilliland _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) from an sn ia at @xmath31 that the universe was decelerating at that time ! further studies ( riess _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; mortsell _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; bentez _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) have confirmed the plausibility of that conclusion , but were unable to strengthen it without further sn ia measurements in that interval .",
    "thus , we now have two strong motivations for pursuing precise sn ia searches and measurements in this redshift range .",
    "+ finally , one might wonder how measurements of the luminosity distances of sn ia can reveal maxima in the angular - diameter ( or observer - area ) distances .",
    "the luminosity distances themselves will not have such maxima .",
    "the answer to this question is simple , though rarely adverted to . according the reciprocity theorem of etherington ( 1933 ; see also ellis 1971 ) , the luminosity distance @xmath32 is very generally related to the angular - diameter , or observer - area , distance by    @xmath33    this simple but important relationship holds for all cosmologies , even very inhomogenous ones .",
    "thus , with observed luminosity distances and redshifts in the above mentioned crucial redshift range , we can very quickly convert to angular - diameter distances , and determine whether the maximum for those distances lies within that range .",
    "+ now we shall go on to work out the simple relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath9 for flat flrw .",
    "the basic equations relating @xmath7 and @xmath9 in flat flrw with @xmath5 are not difficult , but require some effort to obtain and check , because they involve elliptic integrals .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this represents the simplest and clearest example of a more general relationship between the redshift of the maximum of the angular - diameter distance ( in ltb models this is often referred to as the `` areal radius '' ) and the matter and vacuum - energy content of the universe for all flrw and ltb models ( hellaby 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , neither krauss and schramm ( 1993 ) nor hellaby ( 2006 ) illustrate the actual calculation .",
    "their results were obtained numerically , and presented in plotted or table form .",
    "+ in flat flrw , the angular - diameter ( or observer - area ) distance @xmath35 is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the scale factor , @xmath38 is the conformal time , @xmath39 is the scale factor now , @xmath40 is the comoving radial coordinate , and @xmath25 is the redshift of signals from distant sources . here we have used the important flrw relationship    @xmath41    clearly , if we differentiate equation ( [ oadef ] ) with respect to @xmath40 and set the result equal to zero , we shall have the equation for the maximum of @xmath35 , subject to the usual condition that @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "we have then from equation ( [ oadef ] )    @xmath44    which becomes    @xmath45    since the friedmann equation in this case yields    @xmath46    thus , from solving equation ( [ dcdy2 ] ) for @xmath40 , we obtain the equation for @xmath47 , the comoving radial coordinate distance to the point down the observer s past light cone at which the angular - diameter distance is a maximum , as a function of @xmath7 , the redshift there , and of @xmath9 :    @xmath48    this is the first and most essential step in finding the equation we are looking for .",
    "+ the second step involves finding the explicit solution to the friedmann equation , essentially equation ( [ dzdy ] ) , to give us another expression for @xmath47 at @xmath49 substituting this expression into left - hand - side of equation ( [ ymax ] ) gives a unique implicit equation for @xmath9 as a function simply of @xmath7 .",
    "this is the relationship we have been looking for .",
    "+ so , what is the solution of equation ( [ dzdy ] ) ? normally , we might want to simply do a numerical integration",
    ". however , this would not be very useful in our case .",
    "it turns out , as is well known ( byrd & friedman ( 1954 ) , pp .",
    "8 - 10 and formula 260.00 ( p. 135 ) ; see also jeffrey ( 1995 ) , pp .",
    "225 - 226 ) , that , since this equation involves the square root of a cubic polynomial , it has an analytic solution in terms of elliptic integrals . in our case",
    "the most useful form of the solution is :    @xmath50 \\ > , \\label{yeliptic}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath51 are standard elliptic integrals of the first kind , for the angle @xmath52 , which is a function of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the modulus .",

    "it turns out ( see below ) that this same form of the relationship holds in the general ( non - flat ) flrw cases  with the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath54 , and @xmath56 being more complicated functions , involving @xmath9 , either @xmath11 or @xmath8 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we shall explicitly write these down in the next section .",
    "similarly , we quickly can write down the complementary characteristic @xmath5 mass density per source counted as a function of @xmath25 ( see ellis and stoeger 1987 and stoeger , _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the mass - energy density now and @xmath59 , and the last term under the radical sign in the denominator is zero when the universe is flat ( see below ) .",
    "these characteristic flrw relationships for @xmath24 and for @xmath26 are very useful to know ( ellis and stoeger 1987 ; stoeger , _ et al._(1992 ) .",
    "if the universe is flrw and @xmath6 , then these relationships inevitably follow .",
    "if , on the other hand , the data can be put into these functional forms , then it can be shown by solving the field equations with this data ( stoeger , _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; arajo , stoeger , _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) that the universe must be flrw .",
    "thus , being able to fit the data to these forms , assures us that the universe is flrw .",
    "not being able to do so , assures us that it is not flrw .",
    "returning to the main object of our derivation , substituting equation ( [ yeliptic ] ) into the left - hand - side of equation ( [ ymax ] ) , we have simply :    @xmath60     \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\frac{1+z_{max}}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\lambda } + ( 1+z_{max})^3(1 - \\omega_{\\lambda } ) } } \\>.   \\label{elzmax}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is a transcendental relationship for @xmath9 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth noticing that it does not involve any other parameters !",
    "this is the relationship which represents the numerical results obtained by krauss and schramm ( 1993 ) .",
    "+ the solutions to this implicit algebraic equation were obtained using maple , and were checked by hand for values of @xmath9 near the concordance model value of @xmath61 .",
    "they are given in table 1 and figure 1 below .",
    "as a function of @xmath62 and then differentiating this , setting the result to zero , and solving for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "but they all involve explicitly or implicitly the steps we have indicated  solving the friedmann equation to obtain the relationship between @xmath40 and the observable @xmath25 ( redshift ) , and determining the equation for @xmath8 in terms of @xmath47 or , from the first step , its observational equivalent @xmath7 . because of the complication of including a non - zero @xmath9 , at some point a numerical solution will always be needed .",
    "see , for instance carroll , _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) , pp .",
    "510 - 512 .",
    "we have chosen to keep the solution of friedman equation analytic , in terms of elliptic integrals , in order to derive the characteristic flrw closed - form expression for @xmath24 and to solve the resulting algebraic equation numerically .",
    "] we can immediately see , that for the concordance model we should find @xmath63 .",
    "for the nearby best fit model of riess , et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we have already mentioned , @xmath29 .",
    "values of @xmath7 for many other values of @xmath9 are given , as well .",

    "( 1967 ) , carroll , _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) , and hellaby ( 2006 ) .",
    "if the universe is not flat , a slight generalization of these same equations obtains , with the solution for @xmath40 taking the same general form as given in equation ( [ yeliptic ] ) .",
    "the generalization of equation ( [ elzmax ] ) in this case will , however , include  as is intuitively clear  a dependence on @xmath11 as well as on @xmath9 . using the general relationship emphasized by hellaby ( 2006 )    @xmath64",
    "we can determine @xmath11 through @xmath22 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to stress that equation ( [ lcmmax ] ) holds for these quantities as measured at @xmath7 , or @xmath47 , down the observer s past light cone . from hellaby s ( 2006 ) results",
    ", we easily find that , for flrw ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the density at our time now , @xmath68 .",
    "using this together with the definition of @xmath69 and equation ( [ lcmmax ] ) , we easily obtain . ]",
    "\\label{omegam}\\ ] ]    this can be substituted into the non - flat versions of equations ( [ dzdy ] ) and ( [ ymax ] ) ,    @xmath71    and @xmath72    in passing , we immediately see from equation ( [ omegam ] ) that we have a useful observational criterion for flatness of an flrw universe :    @xmath73 +     \\omega_{\\lambda } - 1 = 0 , \\label{flatness}\\ ] ]    thus , if already know that the universe is flat , or nearly so , and we know both @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we can directly determine @xmath9 , and therefore @xmath11 itself from equation ( [ flatness ] ) .    proceeding on , then , equation ( [ omegam ] ) can therefore be substituted into the non - flat version of equation ( [ elzmax ] ) , which is the same as equation ( [ elzmax ] ) , except that its right - hand - side is identical to right - hand - side of equation ( [ ymax2 ] ) without the @xmath74 factors in the denominator ( these have cancelled out , as before ) .",
    "thus , we have , finally , the resulting algebraic relationship involving @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 as the general flrw relationship corresponding to the flat case given in equation ( [ elzmax ] ) :    @xmath75   \\nonumber \\\\ &   & \\hfill{\\qquad}= \\frac{1+z_{\\max}}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\lambda } + \\omega_{m}(1+z_{\\max})^3 -(\\omega_0 - 1)(1+z_{\\max})^2}}.   \\label{omegaleq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here and in the solution of the friedmann equation for the general flrw case , the parameters associated with that solution are now given by :    @xmath76 , \\nonumber \\\\ k^2 & = & \\frac{(a+b)^2 - ( a - b)^2}{4ab } , \\nonumber \\\\ g & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ab } } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and    @xmath79    here , further ,    @xmath80^{1/2}\\biggr\\}^{1/3 } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\bar{b } = \\biggl\\{\\frac{\\omega_m}{2\\omega_{\\lambda } } - \\biggl[\\frac{{\\omega_m}^2}{4\\omega_{\\lambda}^2 } - \\frac{(\\omega_0 - 1)^3}{27 \\omega_{\\lambda}^3}\\biggr]^{1/2}\\biggr\\}^{1/3}. \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in these equations , remember that @xmath11 is given by equation ( [ omegam ] ) , so that relationship given by equation ( [ omegaleq ] ) is indeed an algebraic relationship involving @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 and @xmath81 .",

    "<S> the plethora of recent cosmologically relevant data has indicated that our universe is very well fit by a standard friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model , with @xmath0 and @xmath1  or , more generally , by nearly flat flrw models with parameters close to these values . </S>",
    "<S> additional independent cosmological information , particularly the maximum of the angular - diameter ( observer - area ) distance and the redshift at which it occurs , would improve and confirm these results , once sufficient precise supernovae ia data in the range @xmath2 become available . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain characteristic flrw closed functional forms for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the angular - diameter distance and the density per source counted , respectively , when @xmath5 , analogous to those we have for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we verify that for flat flrw models @xmath7  as is already known but rarely recognized  </S>",
    "<S> the redshift of @xmath8 , the maximum of the angular - diameter - distance , uniquely gives @xmath9 , the amount of vacuum energy in the universe , independently of @xmath10 , the hubble parameter . for non - flat models determination of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 gives both @xmath9 and @xmath11 , the amount of matter in the universe , as long as we know @xmath10 independently . </S>",
    "<S> finally , determination of @xmath8 automatically gives a very simple observational criterion for whether or not the universe is flat  presuming that it is flrw .    </S>",
