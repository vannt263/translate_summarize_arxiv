    "debt analysis has received recently a lot of attention from the research community in an effort to explain the `` nature '' of consumer indebtness that has emerged recently in the developed countries . among the three fundamental research questions posed in the analysis of this social problem @xcite",
    "lies the identification of factors that affect the level of consumer debt . answering the latter",
    ", ongoing research revealed a series of diverse factors , economic , demographic and psychological , that are related to how deep a consumers goes in debt @xcite providing a deep insight in the `` nature '' of this problem .",
    "the discovery of these factors was mainly carried out by traditional statistical models like linear regression which has the ability to reveal linear associations between variables . however , as common as the utilisation of these models in the field of economics might be , so is their limited ability to deal with characteristics that data from real world applications possess .",
    "their difficulty to handle non - linearity in the data makes them unable to solve non - linear classification problems @xcite , while the colinearity between the independent variables can lead to incorrect identifications of most predictors @xcite .",
    "these limitations make them inappropriate to model successfully consumer indebtness since socio - economic datasets exhibit strong non - linearity among several other inconsistencies .",
    "it also raises questions regarding the validity of the relationships uncovered by these models as their small predictive accuracy can not guarantee the identification of the correct predictors .",
    "in addition to this , most of the research has been conducted on a limited number of observations making hard to consider the findings as representative .    as the need to develop fairly accurate quantitative prediction models becomes apparent @xcite",
    ", we argue that the field of economics can benefit from the variety of techniques and models computational intelligence has to offer .",
    "such a computational model is the neural networks , a system of interconnected `` neurons '' , inspired by the functioning of the central nervous system .",
    "neural networks are capable of machine learning and not only they manage to achieve remarkable prediction accuracy by successfully handling non - linearity in the data but their flexibility in the design of their topology also offers a way to incorporate important steps of the data mining process into a regression model .",
    "the potential of data mining is evident in the numerous ways to pre - process the data in order to tackle any inconsistencies they may contain and to explore the relationships in the data , that be can combined in an elaborate process for knowledge discovery in any difficult real world problem like consumer indebtness .    therefore in order to evaluate",
    "the impact neural networks can make on modelling the consumer debt in a large socio - economic dataset in this work , we compare their performance against random forests and linear regression . in the same experimental setup",
    "we also evaluate the contribution on the performance of these models of a series of data mining techniques like the transformations performed on the data in order to deal with the inconsistencies they contain , such noise , high dimensionality and the presence of outliers and the a classification of debtors identified by clustering .",
    "finally we take advantage of the ability to design the topology of neural networks and we introduce a novel way to incorporate into the topology meaningful information that derives from explanatory techniques applied on data , like clustering and factor analysis , and we assess its performance .",
    "our results show that the transformations on the data improve in a great extend the accuracy of all three regression models and that neural networks achieve the best performance . the contribution of the classifications provided by clustering remains argumentative when it is used as an extra variable but proves to be very useful when it is incorporated in an appropriate way in the topology of the neural networks which leads to a further improvement in the performance of the model .",
    "therefore , we believe that this work not only serves as a comparison between neural networks and other regression models but it also verifies the great of potential of neural networks that can be strong predictors and take advantage of significant results from data mining methods at the same time , sketching a complete framework for the consumer debt analysis including necessary transformations of data , exploratory models and reliable regression model that it may extend to any real world application problem that contains a dataset with similar inconsistencies and characteristics as this one .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as following . in the 2nd section",
    "we discuss the related work on the level of debt predictions and on the models we use for our purposes . in the 3rd section",
    "we introduce briefly the cccs dataset together with transformations performed on its attributes and the clustering approach that identified classes of debtors .",
    "we then present the models in the 4th section whereas in the 5th we proceed with the details of the experimental set up .",
    "finally in the 6th section we analyse the results of our experiments and we conclude our work in the 7th section .",
    "statistical models and linear regression are primarily used for the level of debt prediction in the literature .",
    "a significant amount of the work is summarised in @xcite where they also provide a model for separating debtors from non - debtors .",
    "however , their suggested logit model suffers from a low @xmath0 ( 33% ) . in a similar way , in @xcite the proposed models that take into account psychological factors as predictors , exhibit even lower @xmath0 in their probit models ( around 10% ) .",
    "surprisingly enough the linear regression model presented in @xcite achieves a remarkable 66% @xmath0 but as it is explained in @xcite , this big proportion of variance explained , is due to the small number of respondents . a linear regression model built for estimating the outstanding credit card balance in @xcite exhibits 30% @xmath0 . based on these results and the fact that the models are built on a limited number of observations , we are unsure whether to regard these findings as reliable",
    "since the suggested models fail to explain the variance that exists in the data and the small number of instances can not be considered representative enough .",
    "this is further enhanced by the criticism statistical techniques receive in @xcite , where it is argued that they have reached their limitations in applications with datasets that contain non - linearity in the data , like an indebtness dataset .    on the other hand , random forests ,",
    "a popular machine learning algorithm for data mining , has been shown to be able to handle non - linearities in the data @xcite .",
    "they have received a lot of attention in biostatistics and other fields @xcite due to their ability to handle a large number of variables with a relatively small number of observations and because they provide a way to identify variable importance @xcite .",
    "they manage to demonstrate exceptional performance with only one parameter and their regression has been proven not to overfit the data @xcite",
    ". an interesting application of random forests is in @xcite where a model measuring the impact of the reviews of products in sales and perceived usefulness was constructed .",
    "similarly , neural networks exhibit better generalisation than linear regression models @xcite , allow for extrapolation @xcite and can handle non - linearity @xcite posing as strong predictors .",
    "their huge learning capacity has led many of researchers to believe that they are able to approximate any function that is encountered in applications @xcite .",
    "they have been shown to outperform linear regression models @xcite and in economics they have been successfully used for stock performance modelling @xcite and for credit risk assessment @xcite . a very interesting ability they possess is the ability to fully parametrise the topology of the network introducing a concept of logical structure among the neurons that consist the network .",
    "this has been exploited in @xcite where factor analysis is utilised in order to define the topology of the network and although their result has shown not to actually improve the precision of the existing neural network , it manages to speed up the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "the same idea has been adopted by us in this work for further experimentation in our dataset and has been extended in order to include further information that derives from clustering the data . as neural networks have not been used so far for the purposes of consumer debt analysis , in this work we exploit the many advantages they offer in order to achieve a better modelling of consumer indebtness than the existing ones , supporting their utilisation in the field of economics , in applications of which they already have replaced traditional econometric models .    .",
    "the cccs dataset , introduced in @xcite , is a socioeconomic crossectional dataset based on the data provided by the consumer credit counseling service .",
    "its 58 attributes contain information about approximately 70000 clients who contacted the service between the years 2004 and 2008 in order to require advice about how they can overcome their debts .",
    "the information was gathered through interviews when each client first contacted the service and it varies from standard demographics to financial details , aggregated spending in categories and debt details .",
    "the attributes of interest for the purpose of consumer debt analysis are limited to demographics , expenditure and financial attributes as they can be seen in table i together with their description .",
    "ll @xmath1 & @xmath2 +    pid & individual identifier + * demographics * + age & age of person + mstat & marital status + empstat & employment status + male & sex of person + hstatus & housing status + ndep & number of dependants in household + nadults & number of adults in household + * financial attributes * + udebt & total value of unsecured debt + mortdebt & total value of mortgage debt + hvalue & total value all housing owned + finasset & total value of financial assets + carvalue & resale value of car + income & total monthly income + * expenditure * + clothing & total monthly spending on clothing + travel & total monthly spending on travel + food & total monthly spending on food + services & total monthly spending on utilities + housing & total monthly spending on housing + motoring & total monthly spending on motoring + leisure & total monthly spending on leisure + priority & total monthly spending on priority debt + sundries & total monthly spending on sundries + sempspend & total monthly self - employed spending + other & total other spending + * debt details * + ndebtitems & number of debt items +      like other real world dataset , cccs contains noise and outliers , while at the same time it suffers from high dimensionality . in order to tackle the aforementioned difficulties a series of transformations steps",
    "were performed in an earlier work @xcite that proved to be beneficial for the unsupervised approach of this dataset .",
    "more precisely , homogeneity analysis ( homals ) @xcite was utilised in order to map the categorical demographic data , significant attributes concerning the consumer debt analysis , into two - dimensional coordinates together with a factor analysis on the financial attributes and a clustering on the correlation of the spending items .",
    "these transformations reduced the dimensionality to more compact attributes , removed noise and outliers , provided a sense of interpretability and improved the quality of the clustering .",
    "a summary of the transformations can be seen in fig.1 whereas the new nine transformed attributes include two spatial coordinates that discriminate the demographic variables , three financial factors that summarise all the informations that lies in financial attributes and four behavioural spending clusters that characterise spending in necessity , household , excessive and leisure .",
    "finally , in @xcite these transformations were proved to be useful for the clustering of a random sample of 10000 debtors from the cccs dataset that managed to classify 8370 debtors in seven classes with distinct characteristics .",
    "the characteristics of these classes can be seen in the table ii , which also includes the 1630 debtors that remained unclassified .",
    "further information regarding the dataset itself , the suggested transformations and the clustering results can be found in @xcite as it is not the subject of this work .",
    "our objective is to use the information that derives from the exploratory research that was conducted in @xcite , meaning the transformed attributes and classifications , in order to evaluate their contribution in the level of debt prediction .",

    "linear regression is the simplest of the statistical models and it tries to model the relationship between a dependant variable and one or more explanatory variables .",
    "as someone can refer from the name , linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependant variable and the explanatory variables and tries to fit a straight line in the data . more formally",
    "linear regression is defined as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , .... , @xmath9 are the coefficients and @xmath10,j=1, .... p denote p regressor variables . finally @xmath11 denotes the error term which is assumed to be uncorrelated to the regressors and have mean and variance equal to 0 .",
    "the model takes as input the observations and tries to fit the straight line by estimating the parameters ( coefficients and error term ) . a widely used algorithm for estimating",
    "the parameters is the ordinary least squares(ols ) which tries to minimise the sum of squared residuals .",
    "random forest is an example of ensemble learning that generates many classifiers and aggregate the results @xcite .",
    "the random forest method creates large number of decision trees for the case of classification or regression trees for the case of regression from different random samples of the data .",
    "the samples are being drawn based on bootstrap techniques that allow resampling of instances .",
    "the appropriate tree is being constructed based on each sample and its accuracy is evaluated on the rest of the samples .",
    "the difference from the common decision tree is that when a split on a node is to be decided , a specific number of the attributes can participate as candidates and not all of them .",
    "when the random forest is built the prediction is made by aggregating the votes of all the trees for the case of classification and by averaging the results of all the trees for the case of regression .",
    "it needs the specification of only two parameters , the size of the forest and the number of predictors that can be candidates for each node split and its success is based on its simplicity . the notion of randomness it adopts in its process allows the model to be robust against data overfitting .",
    "a neural network is a directed graph consisting of nodes and edges that are organised in layers . as it models a relationship between the predictors and the response variables , the input layer is consisted of nodes that represent the predictors and the output layer of nodes that represent the response variables if there are more than one .",
    "one or more hidden layers of an arbitrary number of nodes connect these two layers .",
    "each layer is fully connected with the next layer and each edge assigns a weight to the value it takes as input and passes it on the next node .",
    "thus in each node the weighted sum of all the nodes that belong to the previous layer is calculated adding the intercept and the result is being fed into an activation function and passed to the next layer .",
    "the activation function is usually a non - linear activation function like the sigmoid function or the hyperbolic tangent .",
    "the simplest neural network ( perceptron ) has n inputs and one output and it is identical to the logistic regression as it is a non - linear function of the linear aggregation of the input . with this in mind we can easily conclude that a neural network with more than one node in the hidden layer is an extension of the generalised linear models .",
    "a neural network takes as parameters the starting weights of the edges that are usually initialised randomly and the network topology meaning the organisation of the nodes in the hidden layers",
    ". then the model tries to find the optimal weights of the edges by using a learning algorithm like backpropagation on the data .",
    "backpropagation tries to minimise the difference between the predicted value calculated by the model and the actual value .",
    "it does that by calculating this difference and then following the chain rule it moves from the output to the input adapting all the appropriate weights according to a specific learning rate .",
    "resilient backpropagation which is argued to be more suitable for regression purposes @xcite is similar to backpropagation but instead of subtracting a ratio of the gradient of the error function like backpropagation does , it increases the weight if the gradient is negative and reduces it if its positive .",
    "it updates the weights by using only the sign of the gradient and some predefined values .",
    "the value of the update is bigger if the gradient changes sign from the previous update and smaller if it keeps the same sign .",
    "this way it ensures that a local minimum wo nt be missed .",
    "the neural networks tend to overfit the data , a fact that raises a concern of how they can be properly used .",
    "a common technique for avoiding data overfitting is to train the model on a subset of the data and validate it on the rest of the data .",
    "a very popular technigue in supervised learning for this , is the 10-fold cross validation where the data is divided in ten folds and then a model is trained for each fold and gets validated on the rest of the folds .",
    "this is the way to evaluate the accuracy of the model and thus to choose the appropriate number of hidden layers and hidden nodes since this is not known beforehand .",
    "usually different topologies are being tested and the one that minimises the error between the predicted and the actual values on the test set is selected .      the flexibility that neural networks provide in designing the topology",
    "can be exploited to incorporate knowledge extracted by unsupervised learning performed on the data .",
    "thus , in this work we tried to organise the neurons in the hidden layers based on the knowledge extracted by factor analysis and clustering .",
    "the idea behind this was based on the striking resemblance neural networks have with latent factor models , like factor analysis , and on the assumption that the classes of debtors identified by clustering define different relationships between the response variable and the predictors .",
    "factor analysis is a common latent factor model that organises the variables of a dataset into a smaller number of hidden factors that would still contain most of the information from the initial variables .",
    "this way neurons in the first hidden layer can be depicted as latent factors that summarise the input .",
    "the only difference with factor analysis , a widely used latent factor model , is that the relationship between the input variables and the factors is non - linear .",
    "this non - linear relationship would also be able to model the linear relationships between the input variables and the neurons identified by factor analysis .",
    "this idea has been incorporated with the algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "clustering on the other hand divides the debtors into classes with distinct characteristics .",
    "as these classes may model different relationships between the response variables and the explanatory variables this could be introduced in the neural network as an extra hidden layer with as many neurons as the classes .",
    "this would create different functions for each class that will be combined in a more complex relationship in order to produce the final modelling .",
    "the intuition is something similar to clusterwise regression but the combination of different functions for each class is more fuzzy since they are included in a neural network and not hard .",
    "these two ideas form this novel method to use neural networks that we named topology defined neural network ( topdnn ) .",
    "our aim is to test topdnn in the socio - economic context but its disciplines can be extended in creating neural networks models for any real world application .",
    "the aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of neural networks as a regression model that can predict the amount of unsecured debts ( _ udebt _ ) a debtor in the cccs has by using the rest of the variables as predictors .",
    "for this reason we compare its performance against different regression models with different characteristics , like linear regression , random forest regression .",
    "furthermore we check whether a series of transformations we performed in @xcite and the classification of debtors we provided in the same work can improve the performance of the regression so that they be incorporated in the final neural network we aim to develop .",
    "since these models try to optimise different criteria and they are internally validated on different measures when they are fitted into data , we needed to test all these models under a common framework .",
    "so we use the 10-fold cross validation as the method to compare the different models and we selected rmse and @xmath0 as the evaluation criteria .",
    "10-fold cross validation is a standard method for evaluating models in unsupervised learning and it also allows neural networks to avoid data overfitting providing more representative results for their case .    @xmath0 measures the percentage of variance that is explained by the model and it a standardised measure taking values from 0 to 1 with 1 being a perfect fit .",
    "the root mean square error ( rmse ) measures the difference between the predicted values from the model and the actual values .",
    "it is defined as :    @xmath12    where n is the number of observations , @xmath13 is the observed value of the observation i and @xmath14 is the calculated value of the observation i. the best model will minimise the rmse .",
    "for model training we use a random sample of 10000 debtors from the cccs dataset , a subset of dataset that contains no missing values and we already had performed the transformations on and divided in classes @xcite .",
    "all the models are built in r using the _ caret _ package and for linear regression we calculate the weights using the ols algorithm , for random forests we create 500 trees and initialise the number of potential candidates for a node split as m/3 where m equals the number of predictors . for neural networks",
    "the initial weights are randomly assigned and a hidden layer is chosen . in order to choose the optimal number of hidden nodes , we produce ten neural networks for each case with the number of neurons varying from 1 to 10 .",
    "10-fold cross validation is used to evaluate all of them and the one with that minimised rmse is selected as the best model .",
    "we also use both backpropagation and resilient backpropagation for making the appropriate comparisons .",
    "all models are built using both the actual data and the transformed and the classification is introduced as an additional categorical variable . for all of the above we had to create four different datasets that all the regression models will be build upon .",
    "these necessary datasets in order test the contribution of the transformation and the classification provided by clustering together with the performance of the regression models are summarised in table iii .",
    ".description of datasets [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ table 8 ]    the plot of the neural network build with the topdnn approach can be seen in fig .",
    "the weights of the edges have been omitted for classification reasons but the lines have modified accordingly to depict the magnitude of the weights with thinner line representing small or negative weights and thicker lines large weights .",
    "we can notice that the interpretation of neural network is not a trivial task , especially when the network is complicated .",
    "that is their main drawback comparing to linear regression and random forest which have mechanism to assess the variable importance of their models .",
    "however tracing the very thick black lines of the plot we can immediately detect the strong influence _",
    "financialfactor1 _ has on the final outcome as it influences heavily the first neuron of the first hidden which influenced strongly the sixth neuron of the 2nd hidden layer which belongs to the four neurons of the 2nd layer that affect moderately the final outcome .",
    "this relationship between the _ financialfactor1 _ and _ udebt _ can not be quantified or defined but it can be signified .",
    "there are techniques to assess variable importance in neural networks , like sensitivity analysis that can provide the desired interpretabily that is valuable for the analysis of real world applications but we leave this for the future part of our research .",
    "in this work we tried to construct an accurate regression model for the level of debt prediction , a significant task for consumer debt analysis utilising a widely used computational model , neural networks .",
    "for this reason we compared their performance against linear regression and random forests .",
    "our results show that neural networks clearly outperform linear regression .",
    "random forests achieve comparable performance but their only one parameter does not allow for more improvements .",
    "they also proved that all the regression models can benefit from the necessary data transformations and from the unsupervised learning approaches on the data , if these are incorporated properly in the data . trying the latter we devised a novel method for designing the topology of the neural networks utilising information that stems from the factor analysis and clustering performed on the data .",
    "topdnn as our method was named , improved the performance of the models even more and signified the ability neural networks offer in adopting in their design results from previous steps of explanatory research conducted on the dataset .",
    "our work forms a complete computational intelligence framework with the pre - processing of data , clustering to uncover important relationships and the regression model that is suitable for the purposes of consumer data analysis .",
    "this framework exhibits much better performance than the existing statistical methods that dominate the field of economics and it highlights a more sophisticated way to model consumer indebtness that it can extend to any real world application .",
