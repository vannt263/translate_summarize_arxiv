    "according to nonequilibrium thermodynamics , one can specify nonequilibrium states of macroscopic systems by specifying local values of thermodynamical quantities , such as the local density and the local temperature , because of the local equilibrium @xcite .",
    "when one studies transport properties of a mesoscopic conductor ( quantum wire ( qwr ) ) , however , the local equilibrium is not realized in it , because it is too small .",
    "hence , in order to specify its nonequilibrium state uniquely , one must connect _ reservoirs _ to it , and specify their chemical potentials ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) instead of specifying the local quantities of the conductor ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the reservoirs should be large ( macroscopic ) 2d or 3d systems .",

    "in this section , we critically review theories of the dc conductance @xmath3 of interacting electrons in a qwr .",
    "note that two theories which predict different nonequilibrium states can ( be adjusted to ) give the same value of @xmath3 ( to agree with experiment ) .",
    "hence , the comparison of the values of @xmath3 among different theories is not sufficient . for definiteness",

    "we assume that @xmath4 is smooth and slowly - varying , so that electrons are not reflected by @xmath4 _",
    "( i.e. , the wavefunction evolves adiabatically ) .",
    "we also assume that only the lowest subband of the qwr is occupied by electrons .",
    "a finite current @xmath5 is induced by applying a finite difference @xmath6 of chemical potentials between the two reservoirs , and the dc conductance is defined by @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the average value of @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a clean qwr , which has no impurities or defects",
    ". for _ non - interacting _ electrons the landauer - bttiker formula gives @xmath9 @xcite , whereas @xmath3 for _ interacting _ electrons has been a subject of controversy @xcite .",
    "most theories before 1995 @xcite predicted that @xmath3 should be  renormalized \" by the @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a parameter characterizing the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) @xcite .",
    "however , tarucha et al .  found experimentally that @xmath12 for a qwr of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "then , several theoretical papers have been published to explain the absence of the renormalization of @xmath3 @xcite . although they concluded the same result , @xmath9 , the theoretical frameworks and the physics are very different from each other .",
    "since most theories are based either on the kubo formula @xcite ( or , similar ones based on the adiabatic switching of an  external \" field ) , or on the scattering theory , we review these two types of theories critically in this section .      when one considers a physical system , it always interacts with other systems , r@xmath14 , r@xmath15 , @xmath16 , which are called heat baths or reservoirs .",

    ", @xmath18 is the density operator of the total system , and @xmath19 denotes the trace operation over reservoirs degrees of freedom . to find @xmath20 , kubo @xcite assumed that the system is initially in its equilibrium state .",
    "then an `` external field '' @xmath21 is applied adiabatically ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , _ which is a fictitious field _ because it does not always have its physical correspondence ( see below ) .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath20 was calculated using the von neumann equation of an isolated system ; i.e. , _ it was assumed that the system were isolated from the reservoirs _ during the time evolution @xcite .",
    "because of these two assumptions ( the fictitious field and isolated system ) , some conditions are required to get correct results by the kubo formula . to examine the conditions",
    ", we must distinguish between _ non - dissipative responses _ ( such as the dc magnetic susceptibility ) and _ dissipative responses _ ( such as the dc conductivity @xmath23 ) .",

    "( see section [ sec_nmf ] . )    unfortunately , these conditions are not satisfied in theories based on simplified models of mesoscopic systems .",
    "for example , the luttinger model @xcite used in much literature does not satisfy conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) because it is integrable . to get reasonable results , subtle procedures , which have not been justified yet ,",
    "were taken in actual calculations . moreover ,",
    "the non - mechanical forces have not been examined , although they would be important because a mesoscopic conductor ( a qwr plus reservoirs ) is an inhomogeneous system .",
    "we also mention limitation of the kubo formula : it can not be applied to the nonequilibrium noise ( nen ) , which is the current fluctuation in the presence of a finite current @xmath8 ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "the nen at low frequency , @xmath52 , is usually proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "however , the kubo formula assumes power series expansion about @xmath54 , hence can not give any function of @xmath55 @xcite .    in sections",
    "[ sec_combined ] and [ sec_proj ] , we present other formulations which are free from these problems and limitations .",
    "these formulations clarify what is going on in nonequilibrium mesoscopic conductors , because one can find the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "this is impossible by the kubo formula because it evaluates correlation functions in the _ equilibrium _ state .      in view of many problems and limitations of the kubo formula ,",
    "it is natural to try to generalize landauer s theory @xcite to treat conductors with many - body interactions .",
    "namely , the dc conductance may be given in terms of the scattering matrix ( s matrix ) for interacting electrons @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the scattering - theoretical approaches may be as follows : ( i ) neither the translation of @xmath56 into @xmath36 nor the subtle limiting procedures of @xmath57 and @xmath28 is necessary .",
    "( ii ) there is no need for the mixing property of the 1d hamiltonian @xmath58 .",
    "hence , @xmath58 can be the hamiltonian of integrable 1d systems such as the tll .",
    "( iii ) in contrast to the kubo formula , one can calculate the nen @xcite .",
    "however , to define the s matrix , one must define incoming and outgoing states .",
    "although they can be defined trivially for free electrons , it is nontrivial in the presence of many - body interactions . in high - energy physics , they are defined based on the _ asymptotic condition _ , which assumes that particles behave like free ( but renormalized ) ones as @xmath59 , i.e. , before and after the collision @xcite . for example , an electron ( in the vacuum ) before or after the collision becomes a localized  cloud \" of electrons and positrons , which extend only over the compton length , and this cloud can be regarded as a renormalized electron . in condensed - matter physics , on the other hand , the asymptotic condition is not satisfied for electrons in metals and doped semiconductors .",
    "in fact , elementary excitations ( landau s quasi particles ) are accompanied with the backflow , which extends _ all over the crystal _",
    "@xcite , in contradiction to the asymptotic condition .",
    "because of this fundamental difficulty , the scattering approaches to mesoscopic conductors replaced the reservoirs with 1d leads in which electrons are free @xcite .",
    "therefore , real reservoirs , in which electrons behave as 2d or 3d interacting electrons , have not been treated by the scattering - theoretical approaches .",
    "the basic idea of this method @xcite is as follows : since a qwr is a small system , and is most important , it should be treated with a full quantum theory . on the other hand ,",
    "reservoirs are large systems whose dynamics is complicated , hence it could be treated with thermodynamics ( in a wide sense ) . utilizing these observations",
    ", we shall develop thermodynamical arguments to find the nonequilibrium steady state that is realized when a finite @xmath36 is applied between the reservoirs .",
    "this is the key of this method because when the steady state is found , @xmath3 ( and other observables ) can be calculated by straightforward calculations .",
    "although in some cases _ formal _ calculations can be performed without finding the steady state @xcite , we stress that such formal theories are incomplete because another theory is required to relate @xmath36 of such theories with @xmath36 of the reservoirs , by which @xmath3 is defined .",
    "an advantage of the present method is that we do not need to find the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath36 because @xmath8 is directly calculated as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "another advantage is that it is applicable to nen and nonlinear responses because nonequilibrium steady state is directly obtained .",
    "it is generally believed that a 1d interacting electron system is not the fermi liquid ( fl ) @xcite , but the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) @xcite .",
    "for this reason , many papers on 1d systems @xcite use the word fl to indicate _ non - interacting _ electrons , i.e. , a fermi _",
    "gas_. however , we do not use such a misleading terminology ; by a fl we mean _ interacting _ quasi - particles . since the backflow is induced by the interaction @xcite , the landauer s argument of non - interacting particles @xcite can not be applied to a fl . on the other hand ,",
    "real systems have finite length and finite intersubband energies , in contradiction to the assumptions of the tll .",
    "hence , some real systems might be well described as a fl .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 of a fl is non - trivial and interesting @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will show in section [ sec_nmf ] that the results for the fl suggest very important phenomena that is characteristic to nonequilibrium states of inhomogeneous systems .",
    "note also that the following calculations look similar to the derivation of fundamental relations in the theory of the fl @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath3 of mesoscopic conductors was not calculated in such calculations .",
    "the most important point to evaluate @xmath3 is to find the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "we find the nonequilibrium steady state using a thermodynamical argument as follows : in the reservoirs , electrons behave as a 2d or 3d ( depending on the thickness of the reservoir regions ) fl .",
    "since we have assumed that @xmath4 is smooth and slowly - varying , a 2d or 3d quasi - particle in a reservoir , _ together with its backflow _ , can evolve adiabatically into a 1d quasi - particle and its backflow in the qwr , without reflection . in this adiabatic evolution ,",
    "the quasi - particle mass @xmath60 and the landau parameters @xmath61 also evolve adiabatically , and the energy is conserved .",
    "therefore , quasi - particles with @xmath62 are injected from the left reservoir . here",
    ", @xmath63 is the quasi - particle energy ; @xmath64 where @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the quasi - particle distribution .",
    "the last term of this expression represents energy correction by interactions among quasi - particles @xcite . on the other hand , a quasi - hole below @xmath1",
    "should not be injected because otherwise the recombination of a quasi - particle with the quasi - hole would produce excess entropy , in contradiction with the principle of minimum entropy production .",
    "similarly , quasi - particles with @xmath67 are injected from the right reservoir , with no quasi - holes are injected below @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the nonequilibrium steady state under a finite @xmath6 should be the  shifted fermi state \" , in which quasi - particle states with @xmath68 and @xmath69 are all occupied .",
    "hence , the right- ( left- ) going quasi - particles have the chemical potential @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) . considering also the charge neutrality , we can write the distribution function as @xmath72 then , eq .

    "( [ dmufl ] ) , we find that the conductance is independent of @xmath60 and @xmath78 ; @xmath79 since we have identified the nonequilibrium steady state , we can calculate not only @xmath3 but also other nonequilibrium properties such as the nen @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to represent eqs .",

    ", we can show that @xcite @xmath80 hence , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ ifl ] ) as @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , quasi particles ( whose group velocity is @xmath82 ) plus their backflows carry exactly the same current as the bare particles , for the same @xmath27 , i.e. , for the same shifted fermi distribution .",

    "we now consider a clean tll @xcite .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of a tll is described by the charge ( @xmath87 ) and spin ( @xmath23 ) excitations ( whose quantum numbers are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , where @xmath90 denotes the wavenumber ) , and the zero modes ( quantum numbers @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) @xcite",

    "we therefore argue differently : in the linear response regime the steady state must be the state with the minimum energy among states which satisfy given external conditions . otherwise , the system would be unstable and would evolve into a state with lower energy . for our purpose , it is convenient to take the value of @xmath8 as the given external condition . then , from eqs .",

    "furthermore , in the steady state , electrons in the left reservoir and right - going electrons in the tll should be in the  chemical equilibrium \" , in which electrons in the fl phase are transformed into right - going electrons in the tll phase at a constant rate .",

    "he found that @xmath264.\\ ] ] however , this result disagrees with @xmath3 obtained in the previous sections .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy may be understood as follows . by taking the fourier transforms of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ ren_phi ] ) , we can see that only the @xmath265 component of the two - body potential @xmath266 contributes to the screening of the electrostatic potential .",
    "on the other hand , both @xmath265 ( forward ) and @xmath267 ( backward ) components of @xmath266 contribute the landau parameter @xmath268 , i.e. , @xmath269 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ dmufl ] ) shows that @xmath36 has a term ( proportional to @xmath270 ) which can not be interpreted as coming from the screening of @xmath258 .",
    "if we interpret this term in terms of nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( although it is not fully applicable because the local equilibrium is not established ) , the term may be interpreted as a _ non - mechanical force _ in eq .",
    "( [ muandmuc ] ) : @xmath271 here , @xmath16 accounts for possible contributions from @xmath272 and/or @xmath273 .",
    "since @xmath274 , so is @xmath275 .",
    "this means that a finite current @xmath8 induces a finite non - mechanical force @xmath275 , and @xmath8 is driven by _ both _ @xmath35 and @xmath275 in the steady state .",
    "hence , @xmath276 is _ not _ equal to either @xmath277 or @xmath278 .",
    "therefore , the kubo formula can not give the correct value of @xmath3 if the @xmath267 component of the two - body potential is non - negligible , even if the screening of @xmath56 is correctly taken into account , because a non - mechanical force is inevitably induced .",
    "note that this is not the unique problem of the kubo formula , but _ a common problem of many microscopic theories _ which calculate a nonequilibrium state by applying a mechanical force .    a possible way of getting the correct result by the kubo formula would be to apply the formula to a larger system that includes the homogeneous reservoirs or leads @xcite : in that case , @xmath37 , as sketched in fig .  [ fig_inhomo ] , and thus @xmath279 .",
    "however , this seems very difficult because it is almost equivalent to trying to solve the schrdinger equation of the total system , including complicated processes that lead to the mixing property and to the equality @xmath37 .",
    "another possible solution may be to apply zubarev s method @xcite , which , to the authors knowledge , has not been applied to interacting electrons in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "however , one must also include ( a part of ) reservoirs into the hamiltonian because zubarev s method assumes that macroscopic variables ( such as @xmath34 ) are well - defined in the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "as compared with these approaches , the formulations presented in sections [ sec_combined ] and [ sec_proj ] would be simpler ways of getting correct results which include effects of non - mechanical forces .",
    "for a clean qwr , we have obtained the quantized value @xmath280 in both cases of the fl and the tll in sections [ sec_fl ] , [ sec_tll ] and [ sec_proj_ee ] , using different formulations .",
    "the essential assumptions leading to this result are the following .",
    "( i ) the qwr is clean enough and the temperature is low enough ( zero temperature has been assumed for simplicity ) , so that scatterings by impurities , defects or phonons are negligible and e - e interactions are the only scattering mechanism .",
    "( ii ) the boundaries between the qwr and reservoirs are smooth and slowly - varying so that reflections at the boundaries are absent .",
    "( iii ) the reservoirs are large enough , so that they remain at equilibrium even in the presence of a finite current between the reservoirs through the qwr .    when some of these assumptions are not satisfied the observed conductance may deviate from the quantized value .",
    "for example , if boundary reflections are non - negligible , the transmittance @xmath281 ( calculated from the single - body schrdinger equation ) between the reservoirs through the qwr is reduced .",
    "this results in the reduction of @xmath3 by the factor @xmath281 for non - interacting electrons . for interacting electrons",
    ", @xmath3 will be further reduced for the tll because the tll will be  pinned \" by the reflection potential at the boundaries .",
    "this can be understood simply as follows : although the tll of infinite length is a liquid , for which a long - range order is absent , it behaves like a solid at a short distance .",
    "hence , the tll is pinned by a local potential , like a charge - density wave is .",
    "this is the physical origin of the vanishing @xmath3 ( at zero temperature ) for the case where a potential barrier is located _ in _ the tll @xcite .",
    "since the pinning occurs irrespective of the position of the local potential , the ttl would be pinned also by the boundary reflections . note that if one neglects the weakening of @xmath282 in reservoirs ( due to the broadening of @xmath173 , as shown in section [ sec_h ] ) , the ttl would then be pinned also by impurities in reservoirs @xcite .",
    "another example is dissipation by , say , phonon emission . by the dissipation",
    ", the 1d system will lose any correlations over a distance @xmath283 , where @xmath283 is the ",
    "maximal energy relaxation length \" @xcite , which is generally longer than the simple dephasing length ( over which an energy correlation may be able to survive ) .",
    "in such a case the 1d system of length @xmath284 ( @xmath285 ) will behave as a series of independent conductors of length @xmath283 .",
    "one will then observe ohm s law @xcite : @xmath286      the authors are grateful to helpful discussions with a. kawabata , t. arimitsu , and k. kitahara .",
