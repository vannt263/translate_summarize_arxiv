    "the main idea of the dynamo theory , which is believed can explain existence of the magnetic fields observed in cosmos , is that kinetic energy of the conductive motions is transformed into the energy of the magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field generation is the threshold phenomenon : it starts when magnetic reynolds number @xmath2 reaches its critical value @xmath3 .",
    "after that magnetic field grows exponentially up to the moment , when it already can feed back on the flow .",
    "description of transition from the linear regime when influence of the magnetic field onto the flow is negligible to the nonlinear regime , when magnetic energy can exceed the kinetic energy orders of magnitude ( like it is in the planetary cores ) is a subject of the modern researches @xcite . as a result , even after quenching the saturated velocity field is still large enough , so that @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , velocity field taken from the nonlinear problem ( when the exponential growth of the magnetic field stopped ) can still generate exponentially growing magnetic field providing that the feed back of the magnetic field on the flow is omitted ( kinematic dynamo regime ) @xcite .",
    "it appears , that problem of stability of the full dynamo equations including induction equation , the navier - stokes equation with the lorentz force differs from the stability problem of the single induction equation with the given saturated velocity field taken from the full dynamo solution : stability of the first problem does not provide stability of the second one .",
    "moreover , some regimes close to the case 1 from the geodynamo benchmark @xcite are stable in contrast to the solutions with the periodical boundary conditions in space and influence of the boundary conditions can be important @xcite .",
    "one of the simple explanations of this phenomenon ( at least for some regimes ) was offered in @xcite .",
    "using parker s dynamo model for the thin disk it was shown , that the @xmath0-effect , taken from the nonlinear oscillating saturated problem , can still generate exponentially growing magnetic field .",
    "the origin of this effect is closely related to the parametric resonance . here",
    "we develop these ideas and show how the phase shift in the @xmath0-quenching can effect on the behaviour of the generated magnetic field .",
    "one of the simplest dynamo models used in the solar and galactic applications is the parker s one - dimensional model @xcite ( see its development for the galactic dynamo in @xcite ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are azimuthal components of the vector potential and magnetic field , @xmath8 is a kinetic helicity , @xmath9 is a dynamo number , which is a product of the amplitudes of the @xmath0- and @xmath10-effects and primes denote derivatives with respect to a coordinate . for the galaxy",
    "the only one left coordinate is cylindrical polar coordinate @xmath11 . for the thin shells , which we will have in mind in this paper ,",
    "is a latitude @xmath12 .",
    "equation ( [ sys11 ] ) is solved in the interval @xmath13 with the boundary conditions @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath16 . system ( [ sys11 ] ) has growing solution , when @xmath17 .",
    "putting nonlinearity of the form @xmath18 in ( [ sys11 ] ) , where @xmath19 is a magnetic energy , gives quasi - stationary solutions for the positive @xmath20 , see about various forms of nonlinearities in @xcite .",
    "the property of the nonlinear solution is mostly predetermined by the form of its first eigenfunction .",
    "the main result of @xcite was , that simultaneous solution of equations for @xmath21 ( [ sys11 ] , [ non ] ) and similar equations for the new magnetic field @xmath22 : @xmath23 with the same @xmath0 can lead to the exponentially growing @xmath22 , when the field @xmath24 is already saturated .",
    "it happens when @xmath24 oscillates , and initial conditions for @xmath24 and @xmath22 are slightly different .",
    "this effect is very similar to what was observed in the more sophisticated models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "below we consider this effect in more details .",
    "here we return to the system ( [ sys11 ] ) .",
    "so as @xmath0 is a function of the magnetic field which oscillates , in the general case we are in a position to expect appearance of the parametric resonance for @xmath24 , as well .",
    "now we consider the more general form of the nonlinearity with retardation @xmath25 : @xmath26 and find how @xmath25 effects on the magnetic field generation .",
    "results for @xmath27 and @xmath28 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are quite unexpected : in spite of the fact , that @xmath0 depends on the squared magnetic field , the mean magnetic energy is not symmetric on @xmath29 ( @xmath25 is in units of process s half period @xmath30 ) .",
    "after some decrease of the magnetic field amplitude for @xmath31 magnetic field starts to increase being periodical , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the sharp decrease at @xmath32 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) takes place up to the values at @xmath33 , accompanied by the long - term modulation with the period 8 times larger than the period of the original oscillation of @xmath34 @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation increases with increase of @xmath25 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d - e .",
    "the amplitude of the new oscillation starts to change at @xmath37 , resembling beating , see fig  [ fig2]e .     on retardation @xmath25 in @xmath0-quenching .",
    "@xmath38 is normalized in such a way , that @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath25 is measured in units of @xmath35 .",
    ", width=264 ]    increase of @xmath25 up to 0.1 leads to the change of the form of the radial @xmath40 and azimuthal @xmath7 components from sinusoidal to the saw - shaped form , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , accompanied with delay of @xmath41 from @xmath7 . for the larger @xmath25 the phase shift @xmath42 decreases .",
    "increase of @xmath25 to 0.33 leads to the growth of the magnetic field and appearance of the pike - like extremums .",
    "this region of @xmath25 corresponds to the parametric resonance .    -.4 cm    -0.5 cm    -2.5 cm    -0.5 cm    -2.5 cm    -0.75 cm    0.0 cm    the further increase of @xmath25 leads to the sharp decrease of the magnetic field amplitude , see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] . the form of the curve is close to that one for @xmath43 with one exception : the new large period appears .",
    "note , that in yoshimura ( 1978a , 1978b ) such long - term modulation was riched at @xmath44 , see review of some other sources of the long - term variations in the solar dynamo in @xcite .",
    "the different behaviour of @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 may be explained by the accumulation of the time shift between the magnetic field and @xmath0 .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the fact that for @xmath48 behaviour of @xmath45 is very close to that one for @xmath49 .",
    "-0 cm    -1 cm -0.1 cm    up to the moment we did not consider how the magnetic field depends on @xmath12 . the dipole solution is a wave propagating from the poles to the equator with maximum at the middle latitudes for @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "increase of @xmath25 leads to the stripe - like solution , i.e. more contrast changes of the sign of the fields and increase of the magnetic field at the poles fig .",
    "the long term variations are well resolved in fig .",
    "to consider how parametric resonance appears we follow @xcite and present solution for ( a , b ) in the form of the waves : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 we get how generation depends on @xmath25 . then putting it in ( [ sys11 ] ) we get two equations .",
    "equation for @xmath54 does not include @xmath25 , so we consider only production of @xmath55",
    ". then @xmath56 . if @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , then @xmath59 is unstable .",
    "the integral for @xmath60 gives : @xmath61    then @xmath62 and for @xmath63 ( what corresponds to the phase shift between the components @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 @xmath66 grows , and parametric resonance appears , see fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "note , that this analysis explains small decrease of @xmath67 at small @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) which corresponds to the positive values of @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    -0",
    "here we considered the only one form of the nonlinearity for the fixed value of the dynamo number @xmath20 as a function of the time lag @xmath25 in the @xmath0-quenching .",
    "however even this simple model demonstrates variety of effects : change of the form of the poloidal and toroidal fields , regions of the weaker and stronger fields , appearance of the long - term variations .",
    "the quite natural choice of @xmath25 can lead to the sharp increase of the magnetic field amplitude concerned with the parametric resonance .",
    "this explanation does not contradict to the simple linear analysis presented above .",
    "it is very tempting to correspond appeared in simulations the long - term periodicities with that ones of the solar activity larger than the main 22 years period .",
    "the difficulty is to justify the choice of the particular @xmath25 which should be obtained from the solution of the more sophisticated nonlinear model ."
