    "one of the burning questions in science today is the understanding of dark matter .",
    "the quantification of the distribution of dark matter in our universe , at different scales , is of major interest in cosmology roberts75 , rubin2001,salucci2000,deblok2003 , hayashi2007 . at scales of individual galaxies ,",
    "the estimation of the density of the gravitational mass of luminous as well as dark matter content of these systems , is the relevant version of this exercise .",
    "readily available data on galactic images , i.e. photometric observations from galaxies , can in principle , be astronomically modelled to quantify the gravitational mass density of the luminous matter in the galaxy , gallazi2009 , bell2001 ; such luminous matter is however , only a minor fraction of the total that is responsible for the gravitational field of the galaxy since the major fraction of the galactic gravitational mass is contributed to by dark matter . thus , the gravitational mass density of luminous matter , along with constraints on the gravitational mass density of the dark matter content , if available , can help the learning of the total gravitational mass density .",
    "however , the learning of this physical density is difficult in light of the sparse and noisy measurements that are available , coercing the practitioner to resort to undertaking simplifying model assumptions . in this paper",
    ", we present a new way of quantifying the relative support to such a model assumption in two independent data sets , by comparing the posterior probabilities of models given the two data sets .",
    "model selection is a very common exercise faced by practitioners of different disciplines , and substantial literature exists in this field kassraftery , ibf_2001,chipman_2001,ghoshsamanta_2001,barabari_2004,tony , cassella_2009 . in this context",
    ", some advantages of bayesian approaches , over frequentist methods has been reported ibf_2004,robert_2001 .",
    "much has been discussed in the literature to deal with the computational challenge of bayes factors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to name a few ) .",
    "at the same time , methods have been advanced as possible resolutions when faced with the challenge of improper priors on the system variables aitkin , ibf , tony .",
    "however , the computation of posterior , intrinsic or fractional bayes factors persist as a challenge , especially in the context of discrete , non - parametric and multimodal inference on a high - dimensional state space linkbarker_2006 .",
    "this paper demonstrates a novel methodology for quantifying support in two ( or more ) independent data sets from the same galaxy , for the hypothesis that the system state space admits a certain symmetry - namely , isotropy .",
    "assuming isotropy implies that the probability density function in this high - dimensional state space of the system , depends only on the magnitude of the state space vector , and does not depend on the inclination of this vector to a chosen direction .",
    "the null is nested within the alternative in this problem . at the same time , one of the data sets is small and the other large .",
    "also , the dimensionalities of the model parameter vectors sought under the different hypotheses , are also different .",
    "indeed in such a case , testing with multiple hypotheses can be performed , such that one hypothesis suggests that the state space that one of the data sets is sampled from , admits this symmetry while the other hypothesis suggests the same for the other data set ( considering the case of 2 available data sets ) .",
    "however , in the two cases , little prior information are available on the system parameter vectors",
    ". the priors on the model parameters are in fact non - informative ( uniform ) , marked by unknown multiplicative constants . then",
    ", as discussed in ibf_1996a , kassraftery , this results in the ratio of the predictive densities of the data sets , under the models , being defined only up to the ratio of these unknown multiplicative constants .",
    "thus , the bayes factor is rendered arbitrary .",
    "the computation of the bayes factors is then , in principle possible with posterior bayes factors aitkin , intrinsic bayes factors ibf , ibf_1996a or with fractional bayes factors tony .",
    "however in this real - life problem that we discuss here , the implementation of bayes factors gets difficult given that the relative support to an undertaken assumption in two distinct data sets is sought by comparing the posterior probability of models that are characterised by different numbers of parameters . secondly , the more complex model in which the simpler model ( the null ) is nested in this situation ,",
    "is intractable .",
    "the null or the simpler model assumes the model parameter space to bear a simple symmetry , thus rendering posterior computation possible . on the contrary , the alternative ( or the more complex model ) does not constrain the geometry of the model parameter space in any way . thus",
    ", the simpler model is nested within the more complex model . however , under the alternative hypothesis , i.e. in lieu of such simplifying assumptions , it is not possible to compute the posterior probability of the model parameter vectors .",
    "this situation is in principle caused by the complexity of the system , compounded by the paucity of measurements . in the test presented here , learning can be performed - relatively easily under the null - and thereafter , support in the data for the assumption about the symmetry of the model parameter space is quantified .",
    "lastly , it is acutely challenging in this high - dimensional non - parametric situation , to achieve intrinsic priors ibf with imaginary training data sets .",
    "such training data can be generated from the posterior predictive distribution under the null perez_berger , and is subsequently used to train the prior under the more complex model , to implement it in the computation of the marginal density of the real data .",
    "however , the computational difficulty involved in the training of the intrinsic prior even under the null , in this high - dimensional setup , is discouragingly daunting .",
    "the implementation of real training data is not possible either , given that any method implemented to learn the gravitational mass density - particularly the similarly motivated bayesian methodology discussed below - might be misled by undersampled data that is likely to result if subsamples are taken from the already small observed data sets that typify this application .",
    "it was presented in the last paragraph that the generated training data can not be of practical use in real - life applications of the kind we consider here . however , the implementation of real training data , for the purposes of achieving intrinsic priors , is not possible either .",
    "such real training data is obtained as a sub - sample of the available data set . given that for the current application , the data sets are typically small to begin with , estimation of the unknown model parameter vectors using a still smaller ( sub)sample of measurements might be risky in terms of convergence of undertaken inference methods .",
    "the difficulties with the computation of bayes factors that we have delineated above , motivates the need for a test that allows for computation of the comparative support in an available data set for one hypothesis to another , and is operational even with non - informative priors , without needing to invoke any other than the available data set , in the computation of the posterior probability distribution of the hypothesis given the data .",
    "the test is also motivated to work irrespective of the dimensionality of parameter spaces .",
    "motivated by this framework , this paper introduces a new nonparametric test of hypothesis that tests for the existence of global symmetries of the phase space that the available data are sampled from .",
    "the test works in parameter space , in the context of non - parametric bayesian inference when for the two or more cases of differently sized samples , little and/or differential prior information are available .",
    "this new test involves partitioning the space of the model parameter vectors such that one of the partitions - the subspace @xmath1 - contains those parameters for which the posterior probability density given the data , exceeds the maximal posterior density that can be achieved under the null .",
    "outside @xmath1 lie the parameter vectors for which the posterior probability falls below this maximal posterior under the null .",
    "the model parameter vectors that lie in @xmath1 are those that underlie the support in the data against the null .",
    "thus , the probability of the null given a data set is the complement of the posterior probability density integrated over the subspace @xmath1 ( instead of over the whole of the parameter space ) .",
    "such an integral can also be viewed as the probability that a model parameter vector is in the subspace @xmath1 . in this treatment , the probability of a null given the data that is computationally simple to achieve , in the context of bayesian nonparametric inference in high - dimensional state spaces .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : application ] discusses the application , in the context of which the new test is introduced .",
    "the formulation of a phase space @xmath0 as an isotropic scalar - valued function of the velocity and location vectors of a galactic particle , is discussed in section  [ sec : isotropy ] .",
    "the details of the bayesian estimation of the unknown parameters of the galaxy , is discussed in section  [ sec : chassis ] .",
    "the estimated functions of a real galaxy are presented in section  [ sec : bayesianlearning ] .",
    "the null hypotheses that we test are motivated in section  [ sec : testing ] . in section  [ sec : priors ] , we discuss the availability of priors on the unknown functions in the relevant literature and how this affects the testing .",
    "thereafter , shortcomings of the bayes factor computations in the context of this application are delineated in section  [ sec : shortcomings ] . in section",
    "[ sec : outline ] , the outline of the new test is presented ; in particular , section  [ sec : implementation ] is devoted to a detailed discussion about the implementation of this new methodology .",
    "the test is illustrated on simulated data in section  [ sec : simulated ] and on real data in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the paper is concluded with a discourse on the implications of the results , in section  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "as discussed above , it is difficult to learn the gravitational mass density @xmath2 of dark+luminous matter in galaxies , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2 is positive definite , implying that in any infinitesimally small volume @xmath5 inside the galaxy , gravitational mass is non - zero ( and positive ) .",
    "other physically motivated constraints on @xmath2 will be discussed in the next section in the context of learning this function , given the data at hand .",
    "while photometric measurements are more readily available , direct detection of dark matter has hitherto been impossible , implying that measurements that can allow for quantification of the gravitational mass density of dark matter , are not achievable . instead , there are effects of the total ( dark+luminous ) gravitational mass that can be measured , though astronomical measurements that bear signature of such effects are hard to achieve in `` early - type '' galaxies , the observed image of which is typically elliptical in shape . of some such astronomical measurements , noisy and partially missing velocities of individual galactic particles",
    "have been implemented to learn @xmath2 cote2001,genzel , chakrabarty_somak . from this , when the astronomically modelled gravitational mass density of luminous matter , @xmath6 , is subtracted , the density of the gravitational mass of the dark matter content of early - type galaxies can be learnt . in this paradigm of learning @xmath2 ,",
    "the data is referred to as partially missing since the noisy measurements of only one component , namely , the component along the line - of - sight that joins the observer to the particle - of the three - dimensional velocity vector of galactic particles , are typically available .",
    "we view these measurables as sampled from the phase space @xmath7 of the system , where @xmath7 is the space of all the states that the system can achieve . for a galaxy , @xmath7 is the space of the spatial vectors and velocity vectors of all galactic particles . on other occasions ,",
    "the dispersion of the line - of - sight component of the velocity vector comprises the measurement . in either case",
    ", such kinematic data is expected to track the gravitational field of the galaxy in which the sampled particles play .",
    "we ask the question that if the available data include velocity measurements of particles in distinct samples that live in mutually disjoint volumes of @xmath7 , what are the implications for the gravitational mass density estimated using such data sets ?",
    "one major implication is that the estimate of @xmath2 obtained using one data set will be in general , different from that obtained using another data set . of course , for the same system , distinct @xmath8 are impossible - in fact , such a fallacious result , if achieved , can be explained as due to the fact that the used data sets have been drawn from mutually insulated volumes of the galactic phase space , the @xmath0s of which do not concur .",
    "such is possible , if the galactic phase space is characterised by disjoint volumes , motions in which do not communicate with each other .",
    "this is a viable scenario in non - linear dynamics even for systems with moderate complexity ; it is possible that the two types of galactic particles , the data of which are measured , live in distinct basins of attraction that characterise the galactic phase space thomsonstewart . in particular , we configure the question of unequal estimates of gravitational mass density functions , using the available data sets , to the context of the real galaxy ngc  3379 . for this system ,",
    "multiple data sets are measured for two distinct types of galactic particles pns , bergond .",
    "the 3-d spatial location vector of a particle resident in a galaxy is written as @xmath9 , where only the coordinates of the image of the particle - @xmath10 and @xmath11 - can be measured . also , the 3-d velocity vector of a particle is @xmath12 , with only the component @xmath13 being a measurable , i.e. we can only measure the speed with which the particle is approaching us ( the observer ) or receding from us .",
    "the galactic phase space @xmath7 is the space of @xmath14 and @xmath15 of all galactic particles .",
    "thus , @xmath16 .      if we are convinced that motion tracks the gravitational field due to a given gravitational mass density function , then we can write down @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is a function of @xmath2 . in @xcite ,",
    "the effort has been to learn @xmath2 from the data using non - parametric modelling .",
    "the aim in these work is to make inference on the gravitational mass density @xmath2 given observations of only 1 component @xmath13 out of 3 components of the velocity vector of particles resident in the system , where the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath2 is intuitively motivated .    in order to render the problem tractable",
    ", we need to undertake some simplifying model assumptions .",
    "it is useful in such situations to assume something simple about symmetries of the system state space .",
    "the simplest such assumption considers phase space @xmath7 to be isotropic , i.e. for the phase space probability density function @xmath19 , to be isotropic in @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the phase space @xmath0 is @xmath21 . in general , the @xmath0 of @xmath7 has a time dependence , but here we assume the system to have attained stationarity , i.e. for the phase space @xmath0 to be independent of time .",
    "thus , one model assumption that we undertake is that of stationarity of the phase space @xmath0 . such is typically undertaken in the modelling of galaxies since deviation from stationarity",
    "can not be checked in the available data since the data sets offer snapshots at a ( nearly ) unique time point in the evolution of the system , the time scale of which @xmath22 years , bt . there are reports of observational signatures of non - stationarity ; + in ngc  3379 these could be considered to include the x - ray image of ngc  3379 3379_xray .",
    "all in all , at the level of this paper , we can not say that deviation from equilibrium is ruled out .",
    "thus we state that it is under this model assumption of stationarity , that we interpret all results .",
    "the phase space @xmath0 is then a scalar - valued , function of 2 vectors , @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "now , if a general real - valued function @xmath23 of two vectors @xmath24 , is an isotropic function , then @xmath25 , for any orthogonal transformation matrix @xmath26 truesdell , wang .",
    "we recall from the theory of scalar valued functions of two vectors , that if @xmath23 is an isotropic function , its set of invariants ( with respect to @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 .",
    "then , the isotropic function of two vectors , @xmath28 , admits the representation @xmath29 truesdell , shi . in general , @xmath30 is the sum of a function of @xmath31 with a function of @xmath32 and a function of @xmath33 . if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are orthogonal vectors , @xmath33=0 .",
    "then , it follows that    1 .   under the assumption that the phase space @xmath0 is an isotropic scalar valued function of 2 vectors , @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ", it admits the representation @xmath38 , 2 .",
    "if we can write a general phase space @xmath0 as @xmath38 , it implies that it is an isotropic scalar valued function of @xmath36 and @xmath39 ,    where @xmath40 is a sum of a function of @xmath41 with a function of @xmath42 .",
    "( the inner product @xmath43=0),i.e .",
    "@xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 identified as some real - valued functions .",
    "one physical interpretation of the above representation is that the phase space @xmath0 is isotropic if and only if it can be written as a function of the value @xmath40 of the particle energy , where energy of a particle with location @xmath47 and velocity @xmath48 is the function @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 n.b . the symbol @xmath51 is to be distinguished from expectation .",
    "now total energy is the sum of potential and kinetic energies .",
    "thus , to allow for the physical interpretation of @xmath40 as the value of the particle energy , we choose @xmath52 to be the gravitational potential energy , ( written as a function of @xmath53 ) and the kinetic energy @xmath54 .",
    "it merits mention that @xmath2 is a known function of @xmath55 as given by a standard equation of physics - the poisson equation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the laplacian operator and @xmath58 is a known constant .",
    "however , in lieu of information about the nature of the phase space density , and given at least the moderate level of complexity that is envisaged to manifest in phase spaces of galaxies , there is no justification for opting for an isotropic , over an anisotropic prescription for galactic phase spaces .",
    "there is a strong logistical motivation for doing so however - the assumption of an isotropic @xmath59 renders the calculations involved in the learning of @xmath2 relatively easier .",
    "the details of this learning , given the data and the assumed prescription of isotropy for @xmath59 , are discussed in section  [ sec : chassis ] . in principle , learning @xmath2 after relaxing the assumption of isotropy , under a particular restrictive prescription for including anisotropy , can still be possible with a much harder computational procedure ( chakrabarty and saha , under preparation ) .",
    "however , it is impossible to learn @xmath2 in the general anisotropic cases , given the typically partially missing nature of the kinematic data , under an unrestricted model for the anisotropy of phase space .",
    "thus , the estimate of @xmath2 is sensitive to the prescription chosen for the phase space symmetry - isotropic or not , and if anisotropic , to the value of the `` anisotropy parameter '' .",
    "this problem refers to the lack of identifiability among solutions for @xmath2 , caused by lack of knowledge about the state of isotropy of galactic phase spaces . and",
    "is referred to as the mass - anisotropy degeneracy in the astrophysical literature @xcite .",
    "the problem has been a pressing concern of @xcite when they advance the possibility that anisotropy might be introduced into @xmath59 of galaxy ngc  3379 due to evolutionary reasons , which @xcite had ignored .",
    "disagree that this could explain the identification of the low dark matter content in ngc 3379 by @xcite given that the existence of anisotropy was included in the data analysis employed in the earlier work .",
    "they stress that `` anisotropy parameter '' recovered from their kinematic data and that obtained from the simulations presented in @xcite , are similar in nature . .",
    "here , the anisotropy parameter is a parametrisation of the deviation from an isotropic phase space density , defined as @xmath60 bt , where @xmath61 is the variance in the @xmath62-th component of @xmath14 , @xmath63 .",
    "however , the suggestion advanced in this paper is more general .",
    "firstly , the learning of @xmath2 is nonparametric , so an explicit parametrisation of anisotropy is not of relevance .",
    "importantly , if the test of hypothesis that we develop here , suggests less support in one data set over another , to the model assumption of an isotropic phase space @xmath0 , it would imply that the two data sets have been sampled from distinct phase space density functions that will then be interpreted as fundamentally different .",
    "such unequal @xmath0s can not in general be reconciled with each other , merely by adjusting one parameter , the physical interpretation of which is the anisotropy parameter as given in astrophysical literature .      in general",
    ", the phase space @xmath0 will contain parameters @xmath64 , i.e. the phase space @xmath0 is @xmath65 .",
    "given data @xmath66 of the observable phase space coordinates of a sample of @xmath67 particles , the likelihood function @xmath68 can be written using the phase space @xmath0 @xmath69 since by definition , @xmath70 , where the data vector of the @xmath62-th particle is @xmath71 and the spatial and velocity vectors of this particle are @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , @xmath74 . however , there are two points of worry at this stage .",
    "firstly , we want to learn @xmath2 but it would appear that the likelihood proposed above does not include this function in its definition . generally speaking , in such situations , we would need to embed the sought unknown function ( @xmath2 ) in the definition of the phase space @xmath0 by suggesting that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "this calls for identification of a function @xmath77 using domain knowledge .",
    "the likelihood would then in general be written as @xmath78 where the data are considered to be @xmath79 .    in our case",
    ", we have already identified that the admissible representation of an isotropic phase space @xmath0 , is as a function of particle energy , ( section  [ sec : isotropy ] ) , which is itself the sum of potential and kinetic energies .",
    "we have defined @xmath80 , ( see equations  [ eqn : eng1 ] , equation  [ eqn : eng2 ] ) , where @xmath55 depends on the sought unknown function @xmath2 via poisson equation ( see equation  [ eqn : poisson ] ) .",
    "thus , a function that has @xmath81 embedded in it , is the energy function @xmath82 that we now re - write as @xmath83 , so that @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the euclidian norm of a vector . to summarise",
    ", the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath2 is ensured by suggesting that the phase space @xmath0 depends on value of energy function , @xmath40 . given this",
    ", we could suggest that the phase space density is @xmath87 .",
    "however , here we assume that the phase space is isotropic and encode this assumption by writing the phase space @xmath0 as a function of energy alone , with no dependence on any other variables ( see section  3.1 ) .",
    "in fact , we assume that phase space @xmath0 is @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath88 ( by equation  [ eqn : engg ] ) .",
    "now , there are no universally accepted parametric forms of the gravitational mass density of all matter in galaxies , known of in the astronomical literature .",
    "this urges a fully non - parametric model for @xmath89 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a fully discretised model such that the range of @xmath90 is binned , with @xmath91 defining the @xmath92-th @xmath15-bin of width @xmath93 .",
    "we define that when @xmath90 is in the @xmath92-th @xmath15-bin , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and define the vector @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath97 is the discretised form of the unknown function @xmath98 that we seek to learn from the data . in light of this",
    ", we view the energy function as @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , there is again no guideline in the literature as to the nature of dependence of the phase space @xmath0 on energy , motivating a non - parametric model for @xmath38 too .",
    "the relevant range of energy values is discretised such that @xmath100 defines the @xmath101-th @xmath51-bin of width @xmath102 , inside which , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath103 for @xmath40 in the @xmath101-th @xmath51-bin , @xmath104 .",
    "we define the vector @xmath105 .",
    "indeed @xmath106 is unknown and we attempt to learn it from the data .",
    "our second worry is with the suggestion for the likelihood in equation  [ eqn : likeli ] .",
    "we recall that the data @xmath66 is partially missing as it does not comprise measurements of all 6 phase space coordinates ; in fact @xmath107 .",
    "thus , in addition to the line - of - sight speed @xmath13 , the measurables include the spatial locations @xmath108 of the particle on the image of the galaxy .",
    "let @xmath109 .",
    "the data is then sampled from the @xmath0 @xmath110 of the subspace @xmath111 , so that likelihood should be defined in terms of @xmath110 .",
    "in other words , the likelihood function can not contain the unobservable variables @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the definition of likelihood in equation  [ eqn : init_likeli ] has to be modified and written in terms of the projected phase space @xmath0 @xmath113 , where this projected @xmath0 results from the projection of @xmath114 onto the space of the observables , @xmath115 . assuming the observed vectors",
    "@xmath116 , @xmath117 , to be @xmath118 , the likelihood function is then defined as @xmath119 where the projected phase space @xmath0 for the @xmath62-th data point , @xmath113 , results from projecting the phase space @xmath0 @xmath38 onto the subspace @xmath115 , as in @xmath120 where this projected phase space @xmath0 is normalised at each iteration by a constant given by integrating @xmath121 over all possible values of the observables @xmath122 .",

    "in fact , @xmath123 in the second step of equation  [ eqn : elaboration ] , elaboration of energy as sum of the potential and kinetic energies invokes the idea that the potential @xmath45 is determined via poisson equation ( equation  [ eqn : poisson ] ) , given the gravitational mass density function @xmath124 .    the projection from @xmath7 onto @xmath115 in equation",

    "thus , @xmath198 where @xmath199 is phase space @xmath0 defined in volume @xmath200 and @xmath201 is phase space @xmath0 defined in volume @xmath202 . in terms of the phase space structure of this real galaxy ngc  3379 , we can then conclude that the phase space of the system is marked by at least two distinct volumes , motions in which do not communicate with each other , leading to distinct orbital distributions being set up in these two volumes , which in turn manifests into distinct @xmath0s for these subspaces of the galactic phase space .",
    "the pne and gc samples are drawn from such distinct @xmath0s .",
    "of course , such an interpretation would hold up if we can rule out extraneous reasons that might be invoked to explain the differential support in @xmath177 and @xmath178 to the assumption of phase space isotropy .",
    "such extraneous factors are systematically dealt with in section  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "it merits mention that our result that @xmath203 also suggests that the phase space density that the observed gcs in this galaxy live in , is nearly isotropic .",
    "the motivating idea is that if different data sets are sampled from different volumes of the galactic phase space , where there is no communication amongst these volumes , the gravitational mass density estimates obtained using these data sets will be different .",
    "none of these individual estimates will however tell us of the gravitational mass density function of the whole galaxy , in general .",
    "the worrying implication of this is that interpreting one of these estimates of @xmath2 as the galactic estimate , can be completely erroneous .",
    "the estimate achieved given one data set will then reveal no more about the entire galaxy than the very isolated phase space volume from which these data on particle motions are sampled",
    ".    ideally speaking , the gravitational mass density of the galaxy , at any @xmath204 can be is approximated as + @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the estimate obtained using the @xmath92-th data set , @xmath207 , where there are @xmath208 available data sets that have been drawn from @xmath208 mutually insulated volumes or sub - spaces @xmath209 within the galactic phase space , namely from @xmath210 .",
    "the more the number of such data sets available , i.e. bigger is @xmath208 , the better is the approximation suggested above .",
    "however , in this framework we are always running the risk of misidentifying the estimate of a property of a subspace of the galaxy as that of the galactic property .    here",
    ", the @xmath92-th data set @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the @xmath0 that describes sub - space @xmath213 . then the statement that @xmath214 and @xmath215 are `` mutually insulated '' implies that motions in @xmath216 do not cross over into @xmath215 and vice versa , resulting in @xmath217 , @xmath218 .",
    "thus , @xmath219 are not identically distributed . hence collating all data sets @xmath220 , as a single input into any method that attempts learning the galactic gravitational mass density by invoking phase space densities , will not work , if the method demands the data to be @xmath79 .",
    "( all methods of learning @xmath2 are underlined by the need to invoke the phase space @xmath0 ) .",
    "still , if we are in possession of knowledge of the correlation between the @xmath0s @xmath212 and @xmath221 , we could use the collated data set in such a method to learn the galactic mass density .",
    "however , as there is absolutely no measured , simulated or theoretical information available on the correlation structure between mutually insulated sub - volumes inside galaxies , such a modelling strategy is untenable .",
    "indeed , the development of any such learning strategy , can imply all @xmath208 available data sets jointly , but will be highly sensitive to the non - linear dynamical modelling of the phase space of the particular galaxy in question . at this stage",
    "we recall that for the majority of galaxies , @xmath208=1 and @xmath208 is at most 2 for a few galaxies ; examples of these systems include ngc  3379 pns , bergond , cena ( woodley @xmath222 chakrabarty , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , we can put a lower bound on the total gravitational mass content of the galaxy , as we now present for ngc  3379 .",
    "ngc  3379 is advanced as a dark matter rich galaxy , with the gravitational mass inside a radius of about 20 kpc to be at least as high as about 4 to 10@xmath22310@xmath224m@xmath225 , where m@xmath225 denotes the mass of the sun and the astronomical unit of length , kiloparsec , is abbreviated as kpc .",
    "in the above test , a high support in the gc sample towards an isotropic phase space @xmath0 , along with a moderate support in the sampled pne for the same assumption , indicate that the two samples are drawn from two distinct phase space density functions .    the expectation that the implementation of the pne and gc data sets will lead to concurring gravitational mass density estimates",
    "is foreshadowed by the assumption that both data sets are sampled from the same - namely , the galactic - phase space density @xmath226 .",
    "the apparent motivation behind this assumption is that since both samples live in the galactic phase space @xmath7 , they are expected to be sampled from the same galactic phase space density , at the galactic gravitational potential . however , such does not necessarily follow if - for example - @xmath59 is a non - analytic function : @xmath227 then , if the gc data @xmath228 are sampled from the density @xmath229 and pne data @xmath230 , where @xmath231 , @xmath232 , then the statement that both the observed samples are drawn from equal phase space densities is erroneous .",
    "if this assumption is erroneous , i.e. if observed data @xmath177 and @xmath178 are sampled from unequal phase space @xmath0s ,    1 .",
    "firstly it implies that the phase portrait of the galaxy ngc  3379 is split into at least two sub - spaces such that the observed gcs live in a sub - space @xmath233 and the observed pne live in a distinct sub - space @xmath234 , @xmath232 .",
    "2 .   secondly that the phase space densities that describe @xmath235 and @xmath236 are unequal .",
    "qualitatively we understand that if the galactic phase space @xmath237 is split into isolated volumes , such that the motions in these volumes do not mix and are therefore distinctly distributed in general , the phase space densities of these volumes would be unequal .",
    "this is synonymous to saying that @xmath7 is marked by at least two distinct basins of attraction and the two observed samples reside in such distinct basins .",
    "thus , a split @xmath7 will readily explain lack of consistency in the estimate of support in the two data sets for the null that the phase space density function that these two data sets are drawn from are isotropic .",
    "however , the fundamental question is really about the inverse of this statement .",
    "does differential support in @xmath177 and @xmath178 to isotropic pase space @xmath0s necessarily imply a split @xmath7 ?",
    "indeed it does , since differential support in @xmath177 and @xmath228 towards isotropy of the @xmath0 that describes the respective native phase space @xmath238 and @xmath239 , implies that the distribution of the phase space vector @xmath240 in the sub - spaces @xmath241 and @xmath242 are distinct .",
    "this in turn implies that the phase portrait of this galaxy manifests at least two volumes , the motions in which are isolated from each other . such separation of the motions is possible if these distinct sub - spaces that the two datasets reside in , are separated by separatrices thomsonstewart into isolated volumes , motions across which do not mix .    as for a physical reason for the phase space distribution of the pne to be less isotropic than the gc population",
    ", we can only speculate at the level of this paper .",
    "the gc population being an older component of a galaxy ( than the pne population ) , might have had longer time to equilibrate towards an isotropic distribution .",
    "also , pne being end states of stars , the pne population is likely to reside in a flatter component inside the galaxy , than the gc population .",
    "galactic phase spaces can be split given that a galaxy is expectedly a complex system , built of multiple components with independent evolutionary histories and distinct dynamical timescales .",
    "as an example , at least in the neighbourhood of the sun , the phase space structure of the milky way is highly multi - modal and the ensuing dynamics is highly non - linear , marked by significant chaoticity .",
    "the standard causes for the splitting of @xmath7 include the development of basins of attraction leading to attractors , generated in a multistable galactic gravitational potential . basins of attraction could also be triggered around chaotic attractors , which in turn could be due to resonance interaction with external perturbers or due to merging events in the evolutionary history of the galaxy .",
    "one worry that astronomers have expressed in the literature about the galaxy ngc  3379 is that the spatial geometry of the system is triaxial and not spherical . for us ,",
    "the relevant question to ask is if there is support in the data for the consideration of the gravitational mass density to depend on the spherical radius @xmath142 alone . in our work ,",
    "the fact that the methodology assumes the gravitational mass density to be dependent on @xmath243:=@xmath244 is a manifestation of the broader assumption of phase space isotropy ( see section  [ sec : isotropy ] ) .",
    "thus , our test for phase space isotropy includes testing for the assumption that the gravitational mass density of the galaxy ngc  3379 bears a dependence on the spatial coordinates @xmath245 , only via @xmath142 , @xmath246 . in other words , we have already tested for the assumption that the gravitational mass density depends on the components of the spatial vector , via the spherical radius @xmath142 .",
    "in contrast to the pne and gc samples observed in this galaxy , if two observed sets of galactic particles can be inferred to have been drawn from the same phase space density , we will expect consistency in the gravitational matter density that is recovered by using such data sets in a mass determination formalism . at the end of the discussion presented above",
    ", we will naturally want to know what the true gravitational mass density function of ngc  3379 .",
    "however , if distinct density estimates are available at a given radius , from @xmath208 independent data sets as @xmath247 , then the lower limit on the galactic gravitational mass density at @xmath142 is @xmath248 .",
    "the above results and arguments suggest that it is inherently risky to refer to the gravitational mass density recovered using an observed particle sample - and the gravitational potential computed therefrom - as the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "we have demonstrated this with the example of ngc  3379 and shown that inconsistencies in @xmath145 learnt using distinct observed samples , can not be attributed to any other factor except that these observed samples are drawn from distinct and insular sub - spaces within the galactic phase space , and/or the lack of time - independence in the gravitational mass density or phase space density function .",
