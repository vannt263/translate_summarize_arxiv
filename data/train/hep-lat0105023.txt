    "the qcd phase transition tightly knits together two of the most intriguing features of qcd : when the temperature drops below the critical value @xmath1 , chiral symmetry is broken and quarks become confined .",
    "state of the art lattice results indicate that both these transitions happen at the same @xmath1 ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent comprehensive review of finite temperature lattice results ) .",
    "lattice studies which compare the changing behavior of observables on both sides of @xmath1 might help to better understand the underlying excitations leading to confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "while different ideas for excitations responsible for confinement are still heavily debated , the understanding of chiral symmetry breaking seems to be in better shape and during the last 20 years a favorite candidate for the relevant degrees of freedom has emerged .",
    "it is now widely believed that models of instanton - like excitations provide a good description of chiral symmetry breaking ( for extended reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these models have a wealth of observable signatures and here we set out to test these predictions in an ab initio lattice calculation and we compare the observables on the two sides of the qcd phase transition .    the basic idea of chiral symmetry breaking from instantons is based on two arguments : firstly , the banks - casher relation @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ baca ] ) below ) relates the chiral condensate @xmath2 to the density @xmath3 of eigenvalues @xmath4 of the dirac operator near to zero .",
    "secondly , the near zero modes which build up the density of eigenvalues @xmath5 at small @xmath4 are believed to come from interacting instantons and anti - instantons : as long as an instanton is well separated from an anti - instanton , the dirac operator produces only zero modes which do not contribute to @xmath5 in the banks - casher formula .",
    "as soon as the instanton and an anti - instanton start to overlap , the dirac operator can no longer distinguish them as isolated topological objects and instead of two zero modes produces a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "for small overlap , these two eigenvalues are still very close to the origin but move up ( down ) the imaginary axis as the instanton and anti - instanton approach each other .    while earlier studies of instantons on the lattice mainly were based on direct filtering of the gauge fields such as cooling @xcite , the recent progress for chirally symmetric lattice fermions based on the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite now allows to directly use the spectrum and eigenvectors of a chirally symmetric dirac operator to test the instanton picture ( see @xcite-@xcite for studies of spectrum and eigenvectors of different lattice dirac operators ) . when using the eigenvectors of the dirac operator as a probing tool for instanton - like excitations ,",
    "the basic assumption is that the localization of the eigenvector traces the localization of the underlying instanton configuration , a property which is known for eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0 of the continuum dirac operator in an instanton or multi - instanton background .",
    "the scenario for chiral symmetry breaking sketched in the last paragraph leads to many characteristic effects that should be visible in the spectrum and eigenvectors of the dirac operator .",
    "in particular the spectral density , the localization of eigenvectors and their local chirality give characteristic signatures which can be tested in an ab initio calculation on the lattice and which might support the instanton picture or rule it out .",
    "in this article we report on our lattice studies of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the dirac operator .",
    "we use ensembles of su(3 ) gauge fields in the quenched approximation .",
    "our runs were done on three different lattice sizes in order to study the volume dependence of observables .",
    "the gauge couplings were chosen such that we have ensembles on both sides of the qcd phase transition .",
    "this allows to directly compare the changing behavior of observables as one changes from the confined , chirally broken phase to the deconfining , chirally symmetric phase .",
    "such a direct comparison reveals which degrees of freedom show the most drastic changes and thus are relevant excitations for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "our dirac operator is an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation based on a systematic expansion @xcite-@xcite and we will refer to it as the _ chirally improved dirac operator_. it is considerably cheaper to implement than e.g.  the overlap operator @xcite while producing very similar results for the relevant eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the physical branch @xcite .",
    "this property makes the chirally improved dirac operator ideal for the present study since it allows for very large statistics which would not have been possible for the overlap operator .",
    "we simulate finite temperature qcd by working on a lattice with @xmath6 , using periodic time boundary conditions for the gauge fields , and antiperiodic for the fermions .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath7 .",
    "let us finally remark on the language convention used in this paper : the short and periodic time - direction @xmath8 introduces an additional length scale which is felt by extended excitations of the gauge field .",
    "the solution of the su(3 ) equations of motion at finite temperature is usually referred to as _",
    "caloron_. calorons exhibit a string - like localization in time direction .",
    "however , the transition between calorons and instantons is continuous , since very small instantons hardly feel the finite time extent . thus we here use the term _ topological excitations _ and speak of instantons or calorons only when we want to stress particular differences .    the article is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss the setting of our computations which encompasses a brief presentation of the chirally improved dirac operator ( section 2.1 ) , a discussion of the gauge ensembles ( section 2.2 ) and the techniques used for the diagonalization of the dirac operator ( section 2.3 ) . in section 3",
    "we collect our results for the spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "these results are presented in two parts , section 3.1 where we discuss the density distribution and section 3.2 where we analyze the fermionic definition of the topological charge via the index theorem . in section 4",
    "we present our results for the eigenvectors . in section 4.1",
    "we give a qualitative discussion based on some examples followed by a discussion of the localization properties of the eigenvectors in section 4.2 . in section 4.3 we present our results for the local chirality of the eigenvectors .",
    "the paper closes with a summary in section 5 . in two appendices",
    "we give the details of our dirac operator ( appendix a ) and discuss the fermion zero modes in a classical caloron solution ( appendix b ) .",
    "in the current analysis we use a chirally improved dirac operator @xmath9 which is an approximation to a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is a systematic expansion of a ginsparg - wilson dirac operator in terms of paths on the lattice .",
    "a detailed description of this approach was presented in @xcite and here we only sketch a few basic steps of the construction .    for about three years",
    "it has been understood , that chiral symmetry can be implemented through a dirac operator @xmath9 which obeys the ginsparg - wilson equation @xcite ( we set the lattice spacing to 1 ) @xmath10currently two types of solutions are known , the so called overlap operator @xcite and perfect actions @xcite .",
    "the overlap operator gives a simple expression for a dirac operator obeying eq .",
    "( [ giwi ] ) , but the involved square root of a large matrix , makes a numerical evaluation quite costly . in two dimensions the fixed point dirac operator has been thoroughly tested in the schwinger model @xcite . in four dimensions",
    "the perfect dirac operator has entered the test phase @xcite , but so far no explicit parametrization has been published .",
    "a third approach to the ginsparg - wilson equation is the above mentioned systematic expansion of a solution of eq .",
    "( [ giwi ] ) .",
    "the first step in the construction of our chirally improved dirac operator is to write down the most general dirac operator on the lattice .",
    "this is done by allowing more general lattice discretizations of the derivative .",
    "the standard derivative term makes use of nearest neighbors only but certainly one can include also more remote points on the lattice such as next to nearest neighbors or diagonal terms etc .",
    "each such term is characterized by the product of link variables which form the gauge transporter connecting the two points used in the derivative .",
    "the corresponding set of links can be viewed as a path on the lattice .",
    "the most general derivative on the lattice will then include all possible paths , each of them with some complex coefficient . in order to remove the doublers , in addition to the derivative terms coming with the dirac matrices @xmath11 we also have to include terms proportional to the unit matrix in dirac space . to obtain the most general expression",
    "we include all 16 elements @xmath12 of the clifford algebra , i.e.  we also add tensor , pseudovector and pseudoscalar terms . to summarize , our dirac operator is a sum over all @xmath12 , each of them multiplied with all possible paths on the lattice and each path comes with its own coefficient .",
    "the next step is to apply the symmetry transformations : translations , rotations , charge conjugation , parity and @xmath13-hermiticity which is defined by @xmath14 the property ( [ g5herm ] ) can be seen to correspond to the properties of @xmath9 which are used to prove cpt in the continuum . once these symmetries are implemented the coefficients of the paths in the dirac operator are restricted .",
    "one finds , that groups of paths which are related by symmetry transformations have to come with the same coefficient , up to possible signs .",
    "we denote the most general dirac operator which obeys the symmetries as : @xmath15   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{\\mu } \\gamma_\\mu \\sum_{l_1 = \\pm \\mu } s(l_1 ) \\big [ \\ ; v_1\\ !",

    "a general argument for this behavior can be given and it has been confirmed numerically for the solution presented in @xcite .",
    "we remark , that an equivalent form of @xmath9 presented in @xcite is the basis for a parametrization of the perfect dirac operator .",
    "the final step in our construction is to insert the general expression for @xmath9 into the ginsparg - wilson equation . on the left hand side of the ginsparg - wilson equation ( [ giwi ] )",
    "some of the terms acquire minus signs , depending on the commutator of the corresponding @xmath12 with @xmath13 . on the right hand side",
    "an actual multiplication of all the terms in d has to be performed .",
    "however , using the above notion of a path , the multiplication on the right hand side can be formulated in a algebraic way and then can be evaluated using computer algebra .",
    "once all multiplications are performed one can compare the left and right hand sides of the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "it is important to note that for an arbitrary gauge field different paths , which correspond to different gauge transporters , are linearly independent and can be viewed as elements of a basis .",
    "thus for the two sides of eq .",
    "( [ giwi ] ) to be equal , the coefficients in front of the same basis elements on the two sides have to agree .",
    "when comparing the terms on the two sides , the result is a set of coupled quadratic equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath23 .",
    "this set of equations is equivalent to the ginsparg - wilson equation . after a suitable truncation of ( [ gendirac ] ) to finitely many terms",
    "the system can be solved and the result is an approximation to a solution of eq .",
    "( [ giwi ] ) .",
    "in addition it is possible to include a dependence on the inverse gauge coupling @xmath24 through an additional constraint for the coefficients .",
    "this step allows to work with less terms in the parametrization .",
    "this procedure is similar to the tuning of the mass - like shift which is used to optimize the localization of the overlap operator @xcite .",
    "an explicit list of the terms used in our parametrization of the dirac operator and the values of the coefficients @xmath23 are given in appendix a.    after a test of the 2-d chirally improved dirac operator in the schwinger model with dynamical quarks in @xcite the construction was outlined for four dimensions in @xcite .",
    "a test of a dirac operator based on this approximation was presented in @xcite and it was found that the approximation is particularly good in the physical part of the spectrum .",
    "it was found that near the origin the deviation of the eigenvalues from the ginsparg - wilson circle is very small . since in the present study",
    "we are interested in the spectrum near the origin , this makes the chirally improved dirac operator very well suited for the physical questions analyzed here .",
    "it is numerically much less demanding than the overlap operator and has a well ordered spectrum near the origin such that spectral densities and the formation of a gap can be studied .    before continuing with the discussion of the gauge action in the next subsection ,",
    "let us discuss a general property of the eigenvectors of a dirac operator @xmath9 which obeys the @xmath13-hermiticity of eq .",

    "here we are working with an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation and we do not have exact zero modes .",
