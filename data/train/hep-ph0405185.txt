    "after discovery of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation by the superkamiokande experiment in 98 @xcite , it is found that the lepton sector has much different flavor structure from the quark sector @xcite@xcite .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is the most promising model to explain the tiny neutrino masses and the neutrino oscillation @xcite .",
    "however , the observed mixing angles between the first and second and between second and third generations are almost maximal , and those are different from the naive expectation in the extension of the seesaw mechanism to the grand unified theories ( guts ) . various attempts to understand those mismatches between quark and lepton mixing angles have been made so far .",
    "we may find new clues to understand the origin of the neutrino masses in the future precision experiments of hadrons and leptons . in the supersymmetric ( susy ) models ,",
    "the flavor- and cp - violating phenomena in hadron and lepton physics are windows to probe flavor structure in the high energy physics , such as the seesaw mechanism and the guts .",
    "the imprints may be generated in the susy - breaking slepton or squark mass terms if the susy - breaking terms are generated at the higher than the energy scale . in this case",
    "the susy - breaking terms induce the sizable effect to the flavor- and cp - violating processes in hadrons and leptons , since they are suppressed by only the susy - breaking scale , not the energy scale responsible to the flavor violation such as the right - handed neutrino mass or gut scale @xcite .    in the susy seesaw mechanism",
    "the radiative correction by the neutrino yukawa coupling induces the left - handed slepton mixing even if the soft susy - breaking terms are universal at the gut or planck scale .",
    "this lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) leads to the radiative lfv decay of tau and muon @xcite .",
    "if the susy seesaw model is extended to the susy guts , the right - handed down - type squarks also have the flavor - violating susy - breaking mass terms since they are embedded in common su(5 ) multiplets with the left - handed leptons @xcite@xcite .",
    "this may lead to new flavor- and cp - violating source .",
    "the belle and babar experiments in the kek and slac @xmath0 factories , give new information about the flavor violation of the third generations . the ckm dominance in the flavor- and cp - violating hadron phenomena",
    "is almost confirmed by the experiments .",
    "however , the belle experiment reports that the cp asymmetry in @xmath1 is @xmath2 deviated from the standard - model ( sm ) prediction @xcite . at present the babar experiment",
    "does not observe such a large deviation , and the combined result is not yet significant @xcite .",
    "however , the belle s result might be a signature of the new physics .",
    "in addition to them , the experiments are improving bounds on the lfv tau decay modes by about one order of magnitude @xcite . now the physics in high luminosity @xmath0 factories , whose integrate luminosities may reach to the order of @xmath3 , is discussed .",
    "if these super @xmath0 factories are constructed , we may get new information about the origin of the neutrino masses .    in this article , we review the third generation flavor violation in leptons and hadrons by the neutrino yukawa interaction in the susy seesaw mechanism and the extension to susy guts , which will be probed in the super @xmath0 factories .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino experiments suggest the existence of large flavor violation between the second and the third generations .",
    "the lfv tau decay is a good probe to the neutrino yukawa coupling responsible to the atmospheric neutrino oscillation .",
    "the susy guts may have rich flavor physics in the hadron and lepton sectors as mentioned above .",
    "however , since the flavor- and cp - violating phenomena are indirect probes to the new physics , it is important to take correlation and consistency among various processes .",
    "it is argued that the right - handed sbottom and strange mixing may induce the sizable deviation for @xmath4 from the sm prediction in this model @xcite . on the other hand , it is pointed out that the deviation is strongly correlated with the chromoelectric dipole moment ( cedm ) of the strange quark , and the size of the deviation is limited by the experimental bound on the mercury edm @xcite .    in next section",
    "we review the flavor structure in the minimal susy seesaw model , and the prediction for the lfv tau decay modes and the sensitivities in the future experiments are discussed in section 3 .",

    "@xmath180 is @xmath185 . from this formula , it is obvious that the right - handed squark mixing or the cp - violating phase should be suppressed .",
    "for example , for @xmath186gev , @xmath187gev , and @xmath188 , @xmath189    in the susy su(5 ) gut with the right handed neutrinos , the tau neutrino yukawa coupling induces the right - handed down - type squark mixing between the second and third generations radiatively as @xmath190 when the hierarchical neutrino yukawa coupling and @xmath191 are assumed .",
    "this correction depends on the gut generic phase . from this equation ,",
    "the cedm of the strange quark is larger than the experimental bound when @xmath192 is larger than about @xmath193 gev and @xmath194 is of the order of 1 .",
    "this means that the measurement of the edm of @xmath167hg atom is very sensitive to the right - handed neutrino sector in the susy su(5 ) gut .",
    "the current experimental bound on the edm of @xmath167hg atom is determined by the statistics , and the further improvement is expected @xcite .",
    "also , it is argued recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that the measurement of the deuteron edm may improve the bound on the cp - violating nuclear force by two order of magnitude .",
    "if it is realized , it will be a stringent test on the susy models with the right - handed squark mixing , such as the susy guts .",
    "now let us discuss the correlation between @xmath165 and @xmath195 in the susy models with the right - handed squark mixing . the right - handed bottom and strange squark mixing may lead to the sizable deviation of @xmath164 from the sm prediction by the gluon - penguin diagram , especially for large @xmath35 .",
    "the box diagrams with the right - handed squark mixing also contribute to @xmath164 , however , they tend to be sub - dominant and do not derive the large deviation of @xmath164 from the sm prediction . thus , we neglect the box contribution in this article for simplicity .    the effective operator , which induces the gluon - penguin diagram by the right - handed squark mixing , is @xmath196 when the right - handed squarks have the mixing , the dominant contribution to @xmath197 is supplied by a diagram with the double mass insertion of @xmath181 and @xmath198 ( fig .  [ fig : edm2](b ) ) .",
    "especially , it is significant when @xmath199 is large . the contribution of fig .",

    "since @xmath208 may suffer from the large hadron uncertainty , we take @xmath214 and @xmath215 . from this figure",

    "finally , we discuss the @xmath216 in the susy su(5 ) gut with the right - handed neutrinos . in the last section we show the strong correlation between @xmath217 and",
    "@xmath218 up to the gut generic phases in this model .",
    "thus , the constraint on the strange quark cedm gives a bound on the prediction of @xmath90 smaller than the future sensitivity in the super @xmath0 factories when the gut generic phase is of the order of one .",
    "in this article we reviewed the third generation flavor violation in the susy seesaw model and susy su(5 ) gut with the right - handed neutrinos . after discovering neutrino oscillation ,",
    "the flavor violation induced the neutrino yukawa coupling becomes important .",
    "now the @xmath0 factories starts to access interesting region for @xmath219 . it may give a new information about structure of the seesaw mechanism . also , we show new stringent constraint from the mercury edm on the susy models with the right - handed squark mixing , such as the susy su(5 ) gut with the right - handed neutrinos , since the mercury edm is sensitive to the strange quark cedm .",
    "this constraint implies that the deviation of @xmath164 from the sm prediction , which is observed in the belle experiment , should be suppressed in the susy gut with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "sensitivity to the cp - violating nuclear force may be improved furthermore by about two orders in the measurement of deuterium edm , and this may be a big impact on susy gut .",
