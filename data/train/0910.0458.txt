    "the coronal heating problem is one of the most fundamental open questions in solar physics . the formation of the high temperature solar atmosphere is clearly related to the magnetic fields generated in the solar interior , but how this magnetic energy is converted to the thermal energy of the corona remains unknown .",
    "one important constraint on the coronal heating mechanism is the time scale for energy release .",
    "if energy is deposited into magnetic flux tubes on timescales that are very short compared to a characteristic cooling time , then the corona will be filled with loops that are close to equilibrium and appear to be steady .",
    "active region observations have generally suggested that high temperature loops are consistent with steady heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have found that the observed evolution of the emission is much slower than the radiative and conductive cooling timescales .",
    "there has also been some success in modeling entire active regions with steady heating models @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have argued that observations of the `` moss , '' the footpoints of high temperature loops , are also consistent with steady heating .",
    "they found that the average moss intensities are typically constant over many hours and loops cooling through 1mk were not observed in the moss region they observed .",
    "there is considerable evidence that coronal loops observed at lower temperatures ( @xmath2mk ) are evolving and not in equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these `` warm '' loops appear to have apex densities that are much higher than can be accounted for by steady heating models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of the warm loops are more consistent with impulsive heating models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if it is true that hot loops are close to equilibrium while the warm loops are generally heated impulsively then the coronal heating mechanism becomes even more difficult to understand .",
    "the cooling time for short , hot loops is relatively rapid ( typically a few hundred seconds ) , so heating events on these loops would need to occur very frequently .",
    "the cooling time for the warm loops is much longer ( typically a few thousand seconds ) , so impulsive heating events on these loops would be infrequent .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that the emission at high temperatures is also consistent with impulsive heating models and that the apparent steadiness of this emission is the result of the superposition of many evolving stands along the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous observations have not been able to exclude this possibility .",
    "for example , it could be that the cooling loops are not easy to detect in an active region core because they are faint relative to both the bright moss and the extended corona in which the active region is embedded .    the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on the _ hinode _ mission provide a new opportunity to observe active region emission in unprecedented detail .",
    "eis observes emission covering a very broad range of coronal temperatures : between and , only 4 ionization stages of fe are not present in the eis data ( xxi ) .",
    "eis also observes , xv , xvi , and xvii , providing excellent coverage of the critical temperature range around 3mk @xcite .",
    "xrt is a broadband imaging telescope that observes high temperature plasma very efficiently and at high spatial resolution .",
    "the high cadence xrt data complement eis , which often observes at a much lower cadence , and allows us to track the evolution of coronal plasma over a large field of view .    in this paper",
    "we use eis and xrt observations to examine the properties of coronal plasma in the core of an active region .",
    "the active region that we have selected ( noaa active region 10960 ) is unusual in that most of the overlying warm loops are located to the north and south of the region , providing a largely unobstructed view of the active region core over a wide range of temperatures ( see figure  [ fig : context ] ) .",
    "high cadence eis observations of this region , which was observed by _ hinode _ during the period 413 june 2007 , have shown that the 195.119  intensities , doppler shifts , and non - thermal widths in the moss are constant over long periods of time , suggesting steady heating @xcite . in this study",
    "we find three additional lines of evidence that also indicate that the heating of high temperature loops is steady .",
    "we examine the evolution of the emission in individual pixels in xrt and find that the vast majority of the emission is constant to within approximately 15% during this period .",
    "the inspection of emission at different temperatures in the core of the active region shows that there is no evidence for loops cooling from high temperatures .",
    "we find no relationship between the warm emission (  ) and the steady hot emission (  ) .",
    "finally , we find that we can bring all of the observed moss intensities into agreement with steady heating models , if we allow for loop constriction at the base of the loop .",
    "previous modeling work had found significant discrepancies at the lowest temperatures observed with eis @xcite .",
    "none of these observations is conclusive ; they do not necessarily exclude alternative models that involve non - equilibrium processes .",
    "however , these observations do provide very strong constraints on the mechanism responsible for producing the high temperature emission observed in solar active regions .",
    "the eis instrument on _ hinode _ is a high spatial and spectral resolution imaging spectrograph .",
    "eis observes two wavelength ranges , 171212  and 245291 , with a spectral resolution of about 22m  and a spatial resolution of about 1  per pixel .",
    "there are 1  and 2  slits as well as 40  and 266  slots available .",
    "the slit - slot mechanism and the ccd both image an area on the sun 1024 in height , but a maximum of 512 pixels on the ccd can be read out at one time .",
    "solar images can be made using one of the slots or by stepping one of the slits over a region of the sun .",
    "telemetry constraints generally limit the spatial and spectral coverage of an observation .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more details on the eis instrument .    for these observations",
    "the 1  slit was stepped over the central part of the active region and 25s exposures were taken at each position .",
    "an area of @xmath3 was imaged in about 57 minutes ( see figure  [ fig : context ] ) .",
    "the observing sequence for this observation returned the complete wavelength range from each detector so all of the lines observable with eis are potentially available in these data .",
    "the raw data were processed using ` eis_prep ` to remove dark current , warm pixels , and other instrumental effects using standard software . during the processing",
    "the observed count rates are converted to physical units .",
    "intensities from the processed data are computed by fitting the observed line profiles with gaussians .",
    "one line of particular interest that requires special attention is 192.858 , which is strongly blended with 192.813  and an multiplet near 192.90 .",
    "an algorithm for deconvolving this blend using 188.216  and multi - component fitting has been developed and is discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "we use this approach here to determine the intensities .",
    "the uncertainties for this line are significantly greater than for the other lines that we consider . however , as illustrated by the eis rasters shown in figure  [ fig : eis ] , there is a strong similarity between the deconvolved 192.858  image and other rasters from ions formed at similar temperatures , such as 200.972  and 254.87 .",
    "the xrt on _ hinode _ is a high cadence , high spatial resolution ( approximately 1  pixels ) grazing incidence telescope that images the sun in the soft x - ray and extreme ultraviolet wavelength ranges .",
    "temperature discrimination is achieved through the use of focal plane filters . because xrt can observe the sun at short wavelengths , xrt images can observe high temperature solar plasma very efficiently .",
    "the thinner xrt filters allow longer wavelength euv emission to be imaged and extend the xrt response to lower temperatures .",
    "further details on xrt are given in @xcite .",
    "the xrt data taken around the time of the eis raster consisted of relatively high cadence open / ti - poly images with open / al - thick , open / be - thick , and g band images interleaved at a cadence of about 600s . for this analysis we have processed all of the open / ti - poly images with ` xrt_prep ` to remove the dark current and to do exposure time normalization .",
    "all of the images have been co - aligned to the initial frame using cross correlation . to investigate the longer term evolution of this region we have considered all of the xrt data within @xmath4 hours of the start of the eis raster .",
    "an example xrt image is given in figure  [ fig : context ] .",
    "an animation of these data is available in the electronic version of the manuscript .    in this analysis",
    "we also make reference to observations from _ trace _ , the _ transition region and coronal explorer _",
    "_ trace _ is a normal incidence , multi - layer telescope .",
    "there are 3 channels for imaging the corona : /x",
    "171 , 195 , and 284 . there is also a long wavelength channel for imaging the photosphere , chromosphere , and transition region .",
    "all of the images are projected onto a single ccd and images in different wavelengths must be taken sequentially .",
    "for these observations the data are mostly from the 171  channel , with a few white light , 1600 , and 284  images taken for context .",
    "the 171  data were processed with ` trace_prep ` , despiked , and co - aligned using cross - correlation .",
    "an example trace 171  image is given in figure  [ fig : context ] .",
    "an animation of the data is available in the electronic version of the manuscript .",
    "in this section we presented a detailed analysis of the eis , xrt , and _ trace _ data available for this period .",
    "the eis data represent a snapshot of the active region accumulated over about an hour and yield little insight into the temporal evolution of the emission .",
    "the xrt and trace observations , in contrast , have excellent temporal coverage but somewhat limited diagnostic capabilities . in combination",
    "they allow us to establish a detailed understanding of the plasma properties in the core of an active region and how they evolve in time .",
    "as is suggested by the four - hour xrt movie associated with figure  [ fig : context ] , the large scale pattern of the soft x - ray emission from this region is remarkably steady . to illustrate this",
    "we have selected several points from the core of the active region and plotted light curves for the emission in these individual pixels .",
    "the light curves , shown in figure  [ fig : xrt ] , generally show fluctuation levels of about 1015% around the median intensity for this time interval . in figure",
    "[ fig : xrt ] we also show two points that illustrate the evolution of transient loops .",
    "the lifetimes of these brightenings are generally on the order of 1000s or less and show that the intensities in the core of the active region are steady on timescales that are long compared to a cooling time .",
    "a more systematic view of the variability is obtained by computing the median intensity ( @xmath5 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath6 ) for each point in the co - aligned xrt data cube . a spatially resolved plot of @xmath7 is shown in figure  [ fig : xrt_fluct ] .",
    "note we have considered only those pixels with median intensities above 50dn s@xmath8 .",
    "low intensities well outside the core of the active region are highly variable .",
    "this calculation shows that there a few structures in the core of the active region that are highly variable , such as those illustrated in figure  [ fig : xrt ] , but that the emission in most of the active region is constant to within approximately 15% .",
    "@xcite performed a comprehensive study of active region transient brightenings with the soft x - ray telescope on _ yohkoh_. he found that the distribution of event energies followed a power - law distribution and that the total energy in these events was about a factor of 5 smaller than the energy required to heat the active corona .",
    "our result is qualitatively consistent with this systematic study .",
    "the xrt light curves suggest that the emission in the core of an active region is largely steady , with relatively few significant brightenings and a very high median intensity level ( @xmath9dn s@xmath8 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with previous results from sxt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which showed that the observed emission decayed on timescales that were long relative to a cooling time . to put these observations in perspective",
    ", the cooling time for a 50 mm loop cooling from equilibrium at 5mk is of the order of 800s , while the xrt emission is relatively steady for several hours .",
    "note that a 50 mm loop would connect the middle of the moss regions in this active region .",
    "the core of the active region is clearly made up of the emission from many different loops and it is unclear if the low fluctuation levels are the result of steady heating on individual loops or from the superposition of many evolving loops @xcite .",
    "models based on many evolving loops , however , predict that there should be warm emission ( @xmath10mk ) that is spatially correlated with the cooling of hot loops in the core of the active region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the warm emission should be related to the observed intensity of the hot emission . rising levels of hot emission",
    "should be accompanied by a similar increase in the warm emission .",
    "these predictions can be tested easily with the observations of this region with eis .",
    "the interpretation of many active region observations is complicated by the presence of overlying warm loops . for this region such loops",
    "are largely , but not completely , absent , giving a relatively unobstructed view of the core of the active region at warm temperatures .",
    "this is illustrated by the trace 171  movies associated with figure  [ fig : context ] . in these movies",
    "we see large scale 1mk loops to the north and south of the active region core but not over the core itself .",
    "we also do not see many loops cooling through the trace 171  bandpass that are connected to the moss , similar to the observations considered by @xcite .",
    "the limited amount of overlying emission allows us to look for any faint warm emission that is related to the formation of hot coronal loops .",
    "another useful aspect of these observations is that there is a strong gradient in the intensities of the hot lines ( xvii , , and xrt ) in the core of the active region in between the moss . to illustrate the behavior of the emission at different temperatures in the core of the active region we have selected a line segment parallel to the moss and extracted the intensities from each of the eis rasters .",
    "these intensities are displayed in figure  [ fig : warm_hot ] where we compare the intensities in each line with those from a hot line , 200.972 . to facilitate the comparisons we have normalized the intensities to their values at the end of the line segment where the intensities of the hot lines are generally the smallest .",
    "for the hot lines the intensity along the segment increases by a factor of 3 to 4 in this region . at the cooler temperatures ( xiv ) , however , the intensities are unchanged and show no spatial correlation with the increase of the hot emission .",
    "the behavior of the emission from and appears to fall in between the hot and warm lines , with following fairly closely and behaving more like a warm line .",
    "since the eis raster lacks temporal information it is possible to argue that the more intense emission in the hot lines is evolving and will show up at a later time as enhanced emission at warmer temperatures .",
    "we have , however , already used the xrt observations to demonstrate that hot emission in the core is constant over many hours ( figure  [ fig : xrt ] ) .",
    "inspection of later xrt data for this active region shows that the strong gradients in the intensity and the dark inter - moss region actually persist for several days ( see @xcite figures 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the hot emission shown in the eis rasters is clearly not dominated by transient events .",
    "we note that the intensities of the warm lines are non - zero in the core of the active region .",
    "inspection of the trace image shown in figure  [ fig : context ] suggests that while the inter - moss region is the dimmest part of the active region core , it is not the dimmest part of the active region at these temperatures . as we will show in the next section ,",
    "almost all of the warm lines have inter - moss intensities that are less than 20% of the moss intensities .",
    "the 202.044  line , however , is unusually bright in the inter - moss region .",
    "the lower level of the transition responsible for this line is very sensitive to collisonal de - excitation into other levels and the emissivity for this line rises sharply with decreasing density .",
    "this sensitivity to low density background plasma may account for the enhanced intensity of the 202.044  line in the inter - moss region .",
    "the origin of the warm emission in the core of the active region is unclear .",
    "it is most likely related to unresolved , high lying loops that form around the active region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "scattered light from the bright moss may also influence the observed intensities in this region .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of scattered light in the _ trace _ instrument .",
    "scattered light levels have not yet been measured in eis , but because eis and trace have several similar design elements , such as a front entrance filter supported by a mesh and multi - layer coatings , observations of dim regions with eis are also likely to suffer from some level of stray light .",
    "the moss represents the footpoints of high temperature loops and offers important boundary conditions for physical models .",
    "observations of the moss are particularly useful for constraining physical models since the observed intensity is proportional to the loop pressure and independent of the loop length @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the observed intensity , @xmath13 is the base pressure , and @xmath14 is the filling factor .",
    "this allows for the calculation of physical models of the moss without knowing the loop length .",
    "this is important since the magnetic topology of an active region is difficult to infer , even with the use of vector magnetograms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some previous work comparing eis moss intensities with steady heating models has been presented in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "this work introduced the use of density sensitive lines to determine both the base pressure and the filling factor . for lines formed close to",
    "there was good agreement between steady heating models and the observations . at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "however , there was a dramatic difference , with the modeled intensities being about 400% higher than what was observed .",
    "a similar temperature dependence in the contrast between moss and network intensities was noted by @xcite .",
    "their work suggested that it was difficult to identify moss regions in relatively low temperature emission .",
    "here we investigate the possibility that variations in the loop cross section are responsible for the relatively low moss intensities at low temperatures . for some time",
    "it has been recognized that magnetic flux tubes must expand rapidly in the region between the high beta photosphere and the low beta corona .",
    "that is , coronal loops must look like `` funnels '' in the transition region .",
    "this loop expansion plays an important role in determining the energy balance on coronal loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and needs to be accounted for in modeling the moss intensities .",
    "the network model of @xcite shows a significant constriction at temperatures below about 1mk , qualitatively similar to what has been suggested by the eis observations of the moss .    the first step in performing detailed comparisons between theory and observation with these data is to accumulate the observed moss intensities from this active region .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : moss ] , we follow @xcite and use a density sensitive line ratio to identify the dense moss regions . for this work we focus on the 203.826/202.044  ratio .",
    "the threshold has been set at @xmath15 so that density contours encompass the bright region in the core of the active region . for each line",
    "we have extracted the intensities in this region and computed the distribution of intensities .",
    "the resulting distribution is approximately gaussian and for each line we have determined the median intensity as well as the standard deviation in the distribution of intensities .",
    "a summary of all of the observed moss intensities is given in table  [ table : ints ] .    to account for any contamination from overlying loops or scattered light , we have subtracted an approximate background derived from the low intensity pixels in the inter - moss region . for consistency ,",
    "the same background subtraction procedure is applied to all of the emission lines .",
    "the background intensities are given in table  [ table : ints ] .",
    "it is unclear what uncertainties should be associated with these median intensities .",
    "the moss intensities are relatively high and the statistical errors in the fits to the gaussian line profiles are generally small . furthermore , for simplicity we will work with the median moss intensities and the uncertainties in these values are also small . finally , the errors in our analysis are undoubtedly dominated by the systematic errors in the atomic data and by the assumptions embedded in the hydro modeling , such the assumption of ionization equilibrium .",
    "absent any compelling alternative we assume that the uncertainty in each measured intensity is 15% , which is much higher than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "note that in a previous paper we used the 186.880/195.119 line pair to identify the moss and determine the pressure and filling factor @xcite .",
    "recent work , however , has shown that there are discrepancies between the various and density sensitive line ratios @xcite , leading one to wonder which densities are the most accurate . as we will discuss in more detail in the next section ,",
    "the 258.375/261.058  ratio is generally consistent with the results from and we use the ratio here .    if we assume a constant loop cross section and steady , uniform heating , the only remaining parameters needed to solve the hydrodynamic loop equations are the volumetric heating rate and the loop length . as indicated by equation  [ eq : ints ]",
    ", any family of solutions with the same base pressure will yield the same observed moss intensity . to illustrate this we calculate a grid of solutions that covers a range of loop lengths and heating rates . to solve the hydrostatic loop equations we use a numerical code written by aad van ballegooijen ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider total loop lengths in the range @xmath16100 mm and heating rates that yield maximum temperatures in the range @xmath177.5mk . in the numerical model",
    "the lower boundary condition is set at 0.02mk and the loops are assumed to be oriented perpendicular to the solar surface .    for each numerical solution we calculate the total intensity in the line using the usual expression @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the emissivity computed from the chianti atomic physics database version 5.2.1 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : moss_pressure ] shows the calculated 203.826/202.044  ratio as a function of the pressure at 1.5mk , the temperature of formation for .",
    "the ratio is clearly a function of the pressure alone and allows us to easily convert the observed line ratio into a value for the base pressure .",
    "an example calculation for the 188.216  intensity is also shown in figure  [ fig : moss_pressure ] . with the pressure determined we can now read off the calculated intensities for each line . for 188.216 , for example ,",
    "the calculated intensity is 8625erg @xmath20 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 , which is much larger than what is observed and indicates that the emission is not resolved at the spatial resolution of eis .    calculated intensities for all of the emission lines are given in table  [ table : ints ] .",
    "we have estimated a filling factor of 20% using the median ratio of the observed to modeled intensities for the , xi , xii , and xiii lines .",
    "this corresponds to the 188.216  line . for the emission lines from these ions",
    "there is generally good agreement between the observed and modeled intensities . at lower temperatures , however , the observed intensities are much lower than what is calculated from the simulation .",
    "ratios of the observed to modeled intensities as a function of temperature of formation are displayed in figure  [ fig : table_ints ] .",
    "this plot shows that the constant area model breaks down at temperatures below about 1mk .",
    "this discrepancy is consistent with the comparisons presented previously @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to modeling the observed emission is to assume a loop length and determine the heating rate and filling factor that best fits the observed intensities .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that the observed moss intensities are independent of the loop length , an assumption supported by theory @xcite and by the numerical solutions presented here .",
    "this method has the advantage of being extensible .",
    "our goal is to consider loops with complex geometries and the intensity - pressure approach outlined in the previous paragraphs becomes very cumbersome when applied to models with several free parameters .",
    "we have implemented such an approach using the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization routine ` mpfit ` for the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "the resulting modeled intensities are presented in table  [ table : ints ] and are very similar to those derived from the intensity - pressure relationships . we have assumed a loop length of 50 mm and obtain best - fit parameters of @xmath21erg  @xmath22  s@xmath8 and @xmath23 .",
    "only the emission lines formed at and above are considered in the minimization . in this approach",
    "all of the lines of interest are considered simultaneously and the pressure indicated by the lines is not necessarily reproduced by the model . to emphasize these lines in the final solution",
    "we reduce the uncertainties assumed for these lines to 5% .    to explore the role of geometry in determining the observed intensities we parametrize the cross - sectional area as a function of height using the following expression @xmath24\\right\\},\\ ] ] for @xmath25 .",
    "the area is extended to the other footpoint by symmetry .",
    "the area expansion is defined so that the minimum is @xmath26 and the maximum is @xmath27 .",
    "the gradient in area expansion peaks at @xmath28 and the magnitude of the gradient is inversely proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath29 indicate a sharper transition . this form has been assumed because it allows for the loop expansion to be localized .",
    "previous work has considered functions of the form @xmath30 , where the expansion continues throughout the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is considerable empirical evidence that coronal loops have constant cross sections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our area function is consistent with this . note that in our prescription the loop geometry is fixed and does not respond to heating within the loop .",
    "the expectation is that the constriction will reduce the calculated intensities at the low temperatures .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed intensities appears to occur around the temperature of formation of , which is approximately 1mk . in the constant cross - section case",
    "this temperatures occurs at about 0.5 mm up the loop length .    to solve for the best - fit parameters we assume a loop length of 50 mm and use the levenberg - marquardt approach .",
    "the free parameters are the volumetric heating rate ( @xmath31 ) , the filling factor ( @xmath14 ) , and the loop expansion parameters @xmath32 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "an example solution is shown in figure  [ fig : expand ] and the corresponding calculated intensities are given in table  [ table : ints ] .",
    "the solutions to the constant cross section and funnel models are generally similar .",
    "the constant cross section model has somewhat higher temperatures and lower densities .",
    "the most significant impact on the calculated intensities comes from the area term in the emission measure @xmath33 the funnel model clearly reproduces the intensities at the lower temperatures much better than the constant cross - section models do . in this fit",
    "all of the emission lines are used . to emphasize the lines over the other lines the error assumed for the intensities",
    "is again reduced to 5% .",
    "previous studies on the transition region geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have considered the area as a function of temperature and for comparisons with these works we show @xmath34 derived from the model parameters and the solution to the loop equations in figure  [ fig : expand2 ] .",
    "our result is qualitatively similar to the most promising funnel model derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see model ",
    "b4hl  in their figure 12 ) . in this model",
    "the area is relatively constant until @xmath35 and then expands rapidly , similar to what we show in figure  [ fig : expand ] .",
    "our result , however , is not consistent with the model derived by @xcite from sumer doppler shift measurements ( see their figure 19 ) .",
    "their model shows significant expansion at temperatures above @xmath36 . in both cases ,",
    "as the authors were well aware , comparisons were made with spatially averaged quiet sun observations and the applicability of these results to our modeling of the active region moss is unclear .",
    "@xcite used spatially resolved measurements of the quiet network to examine loop expansion from the transition region to the corona .",
    "the amount of loop expansion that they measured is generally similar to what we have determined here , although it appears to begin at a somewhat lower temperature than in our model .",
    "one factor that we have not considered is the impact of chromospheric absorption on the moss intensities .",
    "@xcite have shown that the evolving , reticulated pattern of the moss is often related to obscuration by chromospheric jets on neighboring field lines .",
    "absorption leads to reduced observed intensities and impacts the filling factors and heating rates determined from the observations .",
    "this chromospheric absorption could also be stronger at the lowest heights and could explain the lower intensities of the lower temperature lines .",
    "this could also potentially complicate the inference of the transition region geometry from the observed intensities .",
    "recent analysis of coordinated eis and sumer observations suggests that emission below the lyman continuum is reduced by about a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this result is predicated on comparisons between 2 line ratios ( 186.880/195.119  and 1241.990/195.119 ) .",
    "as we have discussed , the atomic data for is problematic and there is some uncertainty in this correction .",
    "the results from also do not yield insights into the possibility of additional absorption at lower heights .",
    "clearly more analysis is needed on this important issue .",

    "the ratio is sensitive over a very wide range of densities ( @xmath37 7  12 ) , making it a very useful plasma diagnostic .",
    "it has been found , however , that the and densities generally do nt agree @xcite , leading to the potential for systematic errors in the modeling .    in many previous studies the atomic data for si",
    "has proven to be very robust ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so we have compared the densities derived from the 258.375/261.058  ratio with those from the other line pairs .",
    "the ratio is sensitive over a much smaller range of densities than the and pairs so we have looked for observations of all three line pairs in small active regions , bright points , and the quiet sun , i.e. , regions where the densities are generally lower than in the moss region that we have studied here .",
    "the result of one such comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : dens ] .",
    "this plot shows the densities computed in a small active region from all three line pairs .",
    "these calculations clearly show that at high densities the results are systematically higher than those from and and that the and densities are in good agreement .",
    "we have found similar results from the analysis of 4 other quiet sun and active region observations .",
    "the problems with become more pronounced at the highest densities , which is particularly problematic for the analysis of the moss . in these observations",
    "the peak density is about a factor of 3 higher in . since the observed intensity scales with the square of the density this discrepancy is amplified .",
    "we have derived filling factors of 1020% for this moss region .",
    "emphasizing the ratio would lead to filling factors almost an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive analysis of observations in the core of an active region using data from the eis and xrt instruments on _ hinode _ and _ trace_. the apparent steadiness of the xrt emission , the lack of spatial correlation between the hot and warm emission , and the consistency of the funnel models with the observed emission all point to frequent heating events that keep the hot loops close to equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , these results are consistent with high cadence eis measurements of moss intensities , doppler shifts , and nonthermal widths that show little evidence of dynamical events over many hours @xcite . in combination , these results provide strong evidence that the heating in the core of an active region is effectively steady , that is , the time between heating events is short relative to the relevant radiative and conductive cooling times .",
