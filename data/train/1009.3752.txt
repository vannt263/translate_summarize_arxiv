    "the presence of an important extra line - broadening mechanism ( in addition to the rotational broadening and usually called macroturbulence ) affecting the spectra of o and b sgs is well established observationally ( see simn - daz et al .",

    "* lucy ( 1976 ) ) postulated that this extrabroadening may be identified with surface motions generated by the superposition of numerous non - radial oscillations .",

    "we applied the fourier transform ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we quantified the lpvs in these lines by means of the first , @xmath4 , and third , @xmath5 , normalized velocity moments of the line .",
    "these moments are related to the centroid velocity and the skewness of the line profile , respectively , and are well suited to investigate whether an observed line profile is subject to time - dependent line asymmetry , as expected in the case of a pulsating star .",

    "non - radial oscillations have been often suggested as the origin of lpvs and photosperic lines in ob sgs ; however , a firm confirmation ( by means of a rigorous seismic analysis ) has not been achieved yet . from a theoretical point of view , ( * ? ? ?",
