    "the study of spatial , temporal and polarization correlations of light scattered by inhomogeneous and turbid media has a history of more than a century @xcite . due to the high complexity of scattering media",
    "only single - scattering properties are known at a microscopic level @xcite .",
    "conversely , for multiple - scattering processes the emphasis is mainly on macroscopic theoretical descriptions of the correlation phenomena @xcite . in most examples of the latter @xcite",
    "the intensity correlations of the interference pattern generated by multiple - scattered light are explained in terms of _ classical _ wave - coherence . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent availability of reliable single - photon sources has triggered the interest in _ quantum _ correlations of multiple - scattered light @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , quantum correlations of scattered photons depend on the quantum state of the light illuminating the sample . in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ spatial _ quantum correlations of scattered light were analyzed for fock , coherent and thermal input states . in this paper",
    "we present the first experimental results on quantum polarization correlations of scattered photon pairs .",
    "specifically , we study the entanglement content in relation to the polarization purity of multiple - scattered twin - photons , initially generated in a polarization - entangled state by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "the initial entanglement of the input photon pairs will in general be degraded by multiple scattering .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the scattering process distributes the initial correlations of the twin - photons over the many spatial modes excited along the propagation in the medium . in the case of spatially inhomogeneous media",
    "the polarization degrees of freedom are coupled to the spatial degrees of freedom generating polarization dependent speckle patterns . if the spatial correlations of such patterns are averaged out by multi - mode detection , the polarization state of the scattered photon(s ) is reduced to a mixture , and the resulting polarization - entanglement of the photon pairs is degraded with respect to the initial one .",
    "a related theoretical background was elaborated in @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section ii we report our experiments on light scattering with entangled photons .",
    "first , we present our experimental set - up and briefly describe the many different optical systems that we used as scatterers .",
    "next , we show our experimental results .",
    "the notions of generalized werner and sub - werner states are introduced to illustrate these results . in section",
    "iii we introduce a simple phenomenological model for photon scattering that fully reproduces our experimental findings . finally , in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "our experimental set - up is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .  a krypton - ion laser at 413.1  nm pumps a 1  mm thick @xmath0 ( ) crystal , where polarization - entangled photon pairs at wavelength 826.2  nm are created by spdc in degenerate type ii phase - matching configuration @xcite .",
    "single - mode fibers ( ) are used as spatial filters to assure that each photon of the initial spdc pair travels in a single transverse mode .",
    "spurious birefringence along the fibers is compensated by suitably oriented polarization controllers ( ) . the total retardation introduced by the fibers and walk - off effects at the crystal are compensated by compensating crystals (: 0.5  mm thick crystals ) and half - wave plates ( @xmath1 ) , in both signal and idler paths . in this way the initial two - photon state is prepared in the polarization singlet state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are labels for horizontal and vertical polarizations of the two photons , respectively .",
    "( color online ) experimental scheme : after singlet preparation , the idler photon propagates through the scattering system @xmath5 .",
    "the polarization state of the scattered photon - pairs is then reconstructed via a quantum tomographic procedure ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "the experimentally prepared initial singlet state @xmath6 has a fidelity @xcite with the theoretical singlet state @xmath7 of @xmath8 .",
    "in the second part of the experimental set - up the idler photon passes though the scattering device @xmath5 before being collimated by a photographic objective ( ) with focal distance @xmath9 .",
    "the third and last part of the experimental set - up , consists of two tomographic analyzers ( one per photon ) , each made of a quarter - wave plate ( @xmath10 ) followed by a linear polarizer ( ) . such analyzers permit a full tomographic reconstruction , via a maximum - likelihood technique @xcite , of the two - photon state .",
    "additionally , interference filters ( ) put in front of each detector ( @xmath11   nm ) provide for bandwidth selection .",
    "detectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 are `` bucket '' detectors , that is they do not distinguish which spatial mode a photon comes from , thus each photon is detected in a _ mode - insensitive _ way .",
    "all the scattering optical systems that we used were located in the path of only _ one _ of the photons of the entangled - pair ( the idler one ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "for this reason , we refer to such systems as _ local _ scatterers .",
    "such scatterers can be grouped in three general categories according to the optical properties of the media they are made of @xcite :    type i : :    purely depolarizing media , or diffusers . such media do not affect    directly the polarization state of the impinging light but change the    spatial distribution of the impinging electromagnetic field .",
    "type ii : :    birefringent media , or retarders .",
    "these media introduce a    polarization - dependent _ delay _ between different components of the    electromagnetic field .",
    "type iii : :    dichroic media , or diattenuators . such media introduce    polarization - dependent _ losses _ for the different components of the    electromagnetic field .",
    "type i scattering systems produce an isotropic spread in the momentum of the impinging photons .",
    "examples of such scattering devices are : spherical - particle suspensions ( such as milk or polymer micro - spheres ) , polymer and glass multi - mode fibers and surface diffusers .",
    "type ii scattering systems are made of birefringent media , which introduce an optical axis that breaks polarization - isotropy .",
    "birefringence can be classified as `` material birefringence '' when it is an intrinsic property of the bulk medium ( for example a birefringent wave - plate ) , and as `` topological birefringence '' when it is induced by a special geometry of the system that generates polarization - anisotropy , an example of a system with topological birefringence is an array of cylindrical particles .",
    "finally , type iii scattering systems are made of dichroic media that produce polarization - dependent photon absorbtion .",
    "examples of such devices are commonly used polarizers . a systematic characterization of all the scattering devices that we used was given in ref . @xcite .",
    "the degree of entanglement and the degree of mixedness of the scattered photon pairs can be quantified by the tangle ( @xmath14 ) , namely , the concurrence squared @xcite , and the linear entropy ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "these quantities were calculated from the @xmath16 polarization two - photon density matrix @xmath17 , by using @xmath18=(max@xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "experimental data in the linear entropy - tangle ( @xmath24-@xmath14 ) plane .",
    "the grey area corresponds to unphysical density matrices .",
    "dashed upper curve : maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) , continuous lower curve : werner states .",
    "( a )  polarization - isotropic scatterers ( type i ) .",
    "( b )  birefringent scatterers ( type ii ) . ]    figures  [ fig:2 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) show experimental data reported on the linear entropy - tangle plane .",
    "the position of each experimental point in such plane has been calculated from a tomographically reconstructed @xcite two - photon density matrix @xmath25 .",
    "the uniform grey area corresponds to non - physical states @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve that bounds the physically admissible region from above is generated by the so - called maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) @xcite .",
    "the lower continuous curve is produced by the werner states @xcite of the form : @xmath26 , ( @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 identity matrix .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ]  ( a ) shows experimental data generated by isotropic scatterers ( type i ) .",
    "specifically , our type i scatterers consisted of the following categories .",
    "( i ) suspensions of milk and micro - spheres in distilled water , where the sample dilution was varied to obtain different points ; ( ii ) multi - mode glass and polymer fibers , where the tuning parameter exploited to obtain different points was the length of the fiber ( cut - back method ) ; ( iii ) surface diffusers , where the full width scattering angle was used as tuning parameter .",
    "it should be noted that suspensions of milk and micro - spheres are _ dynamic _ media , where brownian motion of the micro - particles induces temporal fluctuations within the detection integration time @xcite .    in fig .  2  ( a )",
    ", the experimental point at the top - left corner ( nearby @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , is generated by the un - scattered initial singlet state .",
    "the net effect of scattering systems with increasing thickness is to shift the initial datum toward the bottom - right corner ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , that corresponds to a fully mixed state .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ]  ( b ) displays experimental data generated by birefringent scattering systems ( type ii ) . as an example of a system with `` material birefringence '' we used a pair of wedge depolarizers in cascade @xcite .",
    "different experimental points where obtained by varying the relative angle between the optical axis of the two wedges @xcite .",
    "the systems with `` topological birefringence '' we considered consisted of two different devices : ( i ) the first one was a bundle of parallel optical fibers @xcite .",
    "translational invariance along the fibers axes restricts the direction of the wave - vectors of the scattered photons in a plane orthogonal to the common axis of the fibers .",
    "( ii ) the second device was a stack of parallel microscope slides ( with uncontrolled air layers in between ) .",
    "this optical system is depolarizing because it amplifies any initial spread in the wave - vector of the impinging photon .",
    "this photon enters via a single - mode - fiber ( numerical aperture @xmath34 ) , from one side of the stack and travels in a plane parallel to the slides . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , experimental data generated by dichroic scattering systems ( type iii ) are shown .",
    "we used : ( i ) surface diffusers followed by a stacks of microscope slides at the brewster angle and ( ii ) commercially available polaroid sheets with manually - added surface roughness on its front surface to provide for wave - vector spread .",
    "all data thus obtained fall below the werner curve , generating what we called sub - werner states , namely states with a lower value of tangle ( @xmath14 ) than a werner state , for a given value of the linear entropy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "experimental data generated by dichroic scattering systems ( type iii ) . ]    in summary , figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( a)-(b ) show that all data generated by type i and ii scattering systems fall on the werner curve , within the experimental error ; while data generated by scattering samples type iii , which are presented in fig",
    ".  [ fig:3 ] , lay below the werner curve . in section",
    "iii we shall present a simple theoretical interpretation for such results .      in order to estimate the errors in our measured data , we numerically generated 16 monte carlo sets @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath37 simulated photon counts , corresponding to each of the @xmath38 actual coincidence count measurements @xmath39 ( @xmath36 ) required by tomographic analysis to reconstruct a single two - photon density matrix .",
    "each set @xmath35 had a gaussian distribution centered around the mean value @xmath40 , with standard deviation @xmath41 .",
    "the sets @xmath35 where created by using the `` normaldistribution '' built - in function of the program mathematica 5.2 . once we generated the @xmath38 monte carlo sets @xmath35 , we reconstructed the corresponding @xmath42 density matrices using a maximum likelihood estimation protocol , to assure that they could represent physical states . finally , from this ensemble of matrices we calculated the average tangle @xmath43 and linear entropy @xmath44 .",
    "the error bars were estimated as the absolute distance between the mean quantities ( @xmath45 ) and the measured ones ( @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 , @xmath48 . it should be noted that this procedure produces an overestimation of the experimental errors . in the cases where part of the overestimated error bars fell into the unphysical region , the length of such bars",
    "was limited to the border of the physically allowed density matrices .",
    "close inspection of the reconstructed density matrices generated by type ii scattering systems revealed that in some cases the measured states represented a generalized form of werner states .",
    "these are equivalent to the original werner states @xmath49 with respect to their values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , but the form of their density matrices is different .",
    "werner states @xmath50 of two qubits were originally defined @xcite as such states which are @xmath51 invariant : @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath51 is any symmetric separable unitary transformation acting on the two qubits .",
    "the generalized werner states @xmath53 we experimentally generated , can be obtained from @xmath50 by applying a _",

    "these generalized werner states have the same values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the original @xmath50 ( since a local unitary transformation does not affect neither the degree of entanglement nor the degree of purity ) but are no longer invariant under unitary transformations of the form @xmath51 . by using eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) , we calculated the average maximal fidelity of the measured states @xmath59 with the target generalized werner states @xmath60 .",
    "we found @xmath61 , revealing that our data are well fitted by this four - parameter class of generalized werner states .",
    "numerical simulation for our phenomenological model . fig . 4 ( a ) isotropic and birefringent scattering , fig .",
    "4 ( b ) dichroic scattering . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a theoretical study of the analogies between classical linear optics and quantum maps was given .",
    "within this theoretical framework it is possible to build a simple phenomenological model capable of explaining all our experimental results . to this end",
    "let us consider the experimental set - up represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the linear optical scattering element @xmath5 inserted across path @xmath62 can be _ classically _ represented by some mueller matrix @xmath63 @xcite which describes its polarization - dependent interaction with a classical beam of light .",
    "however , @xmath5 can also be represented by a linear , completely positive , local _",
    "map @xmath64 $ ] , which describes the interaction of the scattering element with a two - photon light beam encoding a pair of polarization qubits .",
    "these qubits are , in turn , represented by a @xmath16 density matrix @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath5 interacts with only one of the two photons , the map @xmath65 is said to be _ local _ and it can be written as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the single - qubit ( or single - photon ) quantum map representing @xmath5 , and @xmath68 is the single - qubit identity map . it can be shown that the classical mueller matrix @xmath63 and the single - qubit quantum map @xmath67 are univocally related .",
    "specifically , if with @xmath63 we denote the complex - valued mueller matrix written in the standard basis , then the following decomposition holds : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a set of four @xmath71 jones matrices @xcite , each representing a non - depolarizing linear optical element in classical polarization optics , and @xmath72 are the four non - negative eigenvalues of the `` dynamical '' matrix @xmath3 associated to @xmath63 .",
    "( [ mueller1 ] ) , it is possible to show that the two - qubit quantum map @xmath65 can be written as @xmath73   \\propto \\sum_{\\mu = 0}^3 \\lambda_\\mu \\ ,   t_\\mu \\otimes i \\ ,",
    "\\rho \\ ,     t_\\mu^\\dagger \\otimes i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the proportionality symbol `` @xmath74 '' on the right hand side of eq .  (",
    "[ deco ] ) accounts for a possible renormalization to ensure @xmath75 .",
    "such renormalization becomes necessary when @xmath5 presents polarization - dependent losses ( i.e. , dichroism ) .",
    "we anticipate that when such re - normalization is necessary the map is considered non - trace preserving .",
    "we shall briefly discuss this issue in the conclusion . with these ingredients ,",
    "a phenomenological polarization - scattering model can be built as follows .",
    "first we use the polar decomposition @xcite to write an arbitrary mueller matrix @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent a purely depolarizing element , a birefringent ( or retarder ) element , and a dichroic ( or diattenuator ) element , respectively .",
    "specific analytical expressions for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "second , we use eq .",
    "( [ mueller1 ] ) to find the quantum maps corresponding to @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 and , by using such maps , we calculate the scattered two - photon state @xmath80 . in our experimental realizations we used isotropic scatterers @xmath81 with isotropic depolarization factor @xmath82 , birefringent scattering media @xmath83 , described in terms of the product of a purely birefringent medium @xmath78 and an isotropic depolarizer @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath84 , and finally , dichroic scattering media @xmath85 , which are in turn described by a product of a purely dichroic medium @xmath79 and a purely depolarizing medium @xmath77 .",
    "it should be noted that these product decompositions are not unique .",
    "other decompositions with different orders are possible but the elements of each matrix might change , since the matrices @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 do not commute . filling in the above expressions with random numbers selected from suitably chosen ranges , we simulated all scattering processes occurring in our experiments .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows a numerical simulation of the scattered states in the tangle vs. linear entropy plane , obtained with the singlet two - photon state as input state .",
    "[ fig:4 ]  ( a ) corresponds to isotropic and birefringent scatterers , and fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ]  ( b ) to dichroic scatterers .",
    "the qualitative agreement between this model and the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is manifest .",
    "in summary , we have presented experimental results on entanglement properties of scattered photon - pairs for three varieties of optical scattering systems . in this way we were able to generate two distinct types of two - photon mixed states ; namely werner - like and sub - werner - like states .",
    "moreover , we have introduced a simple phenomenological model based onto the analogy between classical polarization optics and quantum mechanics of qubits , that fully reproduces our experimental findings . in the case of sub - werner states , the phenomenological model represents a non - trace preserving quantum map .",
    "such description might be considered controversial since a non - trace preserving local map can in principle lead to violation of causality when it describes the evolution of a composite system made of two spatially separate subsystems @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that our measured states do not violate the signaling condition as they are post - selected by the coincidence measurement , a procedure which involves classical communication between the two detectors . finally , we expect it to be possible to create states _ above _ the werner curve ( in particular mems ) @xcite , by post - selective detection when acting on a single photon @xcite .",
    "work along this line is in progress in our group .",
