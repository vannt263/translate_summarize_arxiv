    "new experimental techniques in single molecule manipulation of dna and supercoiling control have stimulated improvements in the understanding of dna mechanics @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the measurements have to be interpreted through a rather sophisticated model in order to extract physical constants  @xcite .",
    "different approaches lead to disagreeing values of , in particular , the torsional modulus  @xmath0 of the molecule along its axis .",
    "the method used by moroz and nelson  @xcite leads to the value  @xmath1 , while using the same experimental data the model provided by mzard and bouchiat  @xcite gives @xmath2 . recently ,",
    "another experiment performed two direct measurements  @xcite with a weighted average of @xmath3 . in this letter",
    ", i will establish the domains of validity of the two mentioned theoretical approaches , clarify the origin of their disagreement and compute a value of the torsional constant  @xmath0 with a new model .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : it starts with a short introduction to two widely used models for elasticity of a polymer . in order to take into account dna resistance to torsion , one of them , _ worm - like chain _ model ,",
    "is improved with a new elastic energy term . as these models only contain a _ local _ description of the molecule , the following paragraph introduces the global geometrical description of a single dna molecule .",
    "its three dimensional coiling is described by a quantity called _ writhe _ , whose fluctuations reduce the effective torsional modulus .",
    "i relate the models of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and study their domains of validity .",
    "the writhe fluctuations are interpreted in the following paragraph by considering the loops formed by the molecule .",
    "the last paragraph describes both a full numerical computation of the writhe fluctuations and a one parameter fit for the interpretation in terms of loops .",
    "the different theoretical models are also compared to this new treatment of the writhe , and a value of the torsional modulus is computed .",
    "i will use the notations : @xmath4 , @xmath5 the force exerted on the ends of the molecule and @xmath6 the angle of a vector with the direction of the force , @xmath7 the length of the molecule , @xmath8 the bending modulus , @xmath9 the torsional modulus , @xmath10 the torque exerted on the free end of the molecule , @xmath11 its vertical extension and @xmath12 the rotation angle of the free end .",
    "the torsion @xmath13 of the dna molecule is the difference per unit length of the rotation angle of one strand around the other with respect to the unconstrained state in the same conformation .",
    "it is a function of the arc length  @xmath14 and can be seen as `` twist angle density '' : the torsion integrated along the molecule is called _ twist angle _ and is noted @xmath15 .",
    "thanks to its double helix structure , dna is a very stable polymer . this stability is needed to conserve genetic materials .",
    "it gives opportunity to submit a single molecule to mechanical constraints ( forces above @xmath16 ) without destroying it and to measure its response .",
    "the extension @xmath11 of a single molecule submitted to a force  @xmath5 is the first quantity that has been studied .",
    "it has to be interpreted within a polymer elasticity model",
    ".    the _ freely jointed chain _ ( fjc ) describes a polymer as a succession of independent sticks of length  @xmath17 . for one",
    "stick the elementary partition function is @xmath18 for a whole chain , the free energy is thus  @xmath19 , leading to a relative extension @xmath20 when @xmath21 tends to zero , and @xmath22 for large forces .",
    "the _ worm - like chain _ is on contrary a continuous model based on the bending energy of the axis .",
    "the state variable is the tangent unit vector , described by its angle @xmath6 with the force , thus the phase space is made of functions @xmath23 .",
    "the resistance of the molecule to bending creates a correlation between tangent vectors along a curvilinear distance  @xmath24 called the _ persistence length_. the hamiltonian for this model is obtained by analogy with a quantum system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath25 when @xmath21 tends to zero the worm - like chain extension is @xmath26 . in the large force approximation ,",
    "the molecule is almost aligned with the force ( @xmath27 ) and the hamiltonian  ( [ e.hw ] ) reduces to an harmonic oscillator whose ground state gives the free energy @xcite @xmath28 from @xmath29 , when @xmath30 , one deduces @xmath31",
    "i now compare the two models . at low force",
    ", entropy dominates and the models both describe an object following hooke s law .",
    "requiring the relation @xmath32 between their parameters makes them equivalent .",
    "this is known to be a good approximation when @xmath33 or in other terms @xmath34 . on the contrary at large force",
    ", the two models do not have the same asymptotic behaviour .",
    "comparison between experimental data and theoretical models indicate that the worm - like chain provides a more appropriate description of dna elasticity  @xcite .",
    "the double helix structure of dna has also for consequence a resistance to torsion along its axis .",
    "mzard and bouchiat  @xcite showed that taking into account the local torsion of dna introduces new elastic terms in the hamiltonian  ( [ e.hw ] ) , proportional to @xmath35 : a term due to local torsion energy , @xmath36 , and a term related to the geometry of the molecule @xmath37 this improved model is called the _ rod - like chain_. in the large force approximation , the denominator  @xmath38 , thus to second order in  @xmath6 the hamiltonian rewrites @xmath39 .",
    "this approximation is valid when  @xmath6 is small , thus in a domain where the relation  ( [ e.fver ] ) is correct .",
    "one deduces the expression of the free energy of the rod - like chain in the large force regime : @xmath40",
    "experimental devices also allow to change the angle  @xmath12 , and to measure how the molecule responds to this constraint @xcite .",
    "one says that the molecule is _",
    "supercoiled_. supercoiling is quantified by the writhing angle of the dna axis  @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 this expression is _ a priori _ valid only for _ closed _ chains .",
    "however , in experimental devices the molecule can not go around its ends  @xcite , which is equivalent to having a very long molecule only manipulated in a small region",
    ". the molecule axis can therefore be imaginarily closed and the formula  ( [ e.calu ] ) extends to open chains in experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fundamental geometrical relation between  @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath44 is exact in experimental conditions .",
    "formula  ( [ th.calu ] ) is widely known by dna specialists , in biology and physics  @xcite .",
    "it explains that a dna molecule has two ways to deal with an applied torque : to modify its _ local torsion _",
    "( modify @xmath15 ) or to change its shape ( modify @xmath43 ) .",
    "the twist angle  @xmath15 is only related to the torsion .",
    "the writhe angle  @xmath43 , as it is computed from the shape of the axis , is only related to the curvature .",
    "a general study of dna elasticity performed by marko and siggia  @xcite asserts that a coupling between bending and torsion is at least of the third order in strains , and the estimated coupling constant is small  @xcite . as one wants to focus on regimes close to relaxed state , one shall neglect this coupling and assume that there are no correlations between  @xmath15 and  @xmath43 .",
    "( the same assumption has been made in ref .",
    "( [ th.calu ] ) then gives the fluctuations of @xmath12 in this approximation : @xmath45 the fluctuations of  @xmath15 , thanks to the locality of torsional energy and independance of @xmath46 with @xmath6 , are proportional to the length  @xmath7 , @xmath47 .",
    "if one measures the torsional modulus of a molecule only taking the angle  @xmath12 into account , one one obtains an _ effective _ value , denoted @xmath48 , related to the real torsional constant , @xmath49 , through the fluctuations of the writhing angle : @xmath50 the effect of writhing of the molecule is then to reduce the measured vale of the torsional modulus between its ends . to deduce the value of  @xmath0 _ along the molecule axis _ from measurements , one needs to know the writhe fluctuations .    for the rod - like chain model developed in the preceding section ,",
    "one remarks that @xmath51 is deduced from  @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ e.relrw ] ) , by differentiation @xmath53 , so @xmath54 this result , combined with relation  ( [ e.zw ] ) , was first given by moroz and nelson  @xcite as a correction like in eq .",
    "( [ e.re ] ) , when the force is large enough : @xmath55 their model is therefore an approximation of the more general rod - like chain model described by mzard and bouchiat .",
    "let us now evaluate the minimum force on their common validity range .",
    "expression  ( [ e.mn ] ) is obtained when the molecule is almost straight , namely when @xmath30 .",
    "that might be translated into physical units to  @xmath56 , thus for forces of the order of  @xmath57 .    while mzard and bouchiat s approach is more general , it has been pointed out that it suffers from a pathology related to the writhe formulation  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the expression for the writhe used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath58 is equal to formula  ( [ e.calu ] ) modulo  @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the azimuthal angle of the tangent vector ) .",
    "they are equal only when the molecule can be straightened out without cutting it , nor having a point passing through @xmath61 at any time .",
    "otherwise the formul differ by a multiple of  @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "when the molecule is deformed into a blob , such configurations where the formul disagree are numerous . typically , in this case the molecule has _ loops_.",
    "the following section is dedicated to an estimation of the number of loops in order to extend the validity range of formula  ( [ e.mn ] ) .",
    "each loop contributes to the writhing angle  @xmath43 by an amount of the order of one turn .",
    "i will note @xmath62 the mean square value of a loop contribution .",
    "this quantity will be numerically estimated in the next section . under the assumption that loops are uncorrelated , the central limit theorem asserts that the contribution of loops to  @xmath63 is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the average number of loops for  @xmath66 fixed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a treatment of loops was proposed , but only equilibrium loops were considered .",
    "this approach does not explicitly provide any loop size .",
    "since the length of one stick being @xmath67 , the model avoids the smaller loops , that require much bending energy .",
    "the average number of loops is estimated here by defining a loop as a region where @xmath68 , which gives , using eq .",
    "( [ e.zk ] ) and @xmath32 , @xmath69    thus one obtains an estimate for  @xmath63 in an extended force range by adding the contribution of the loops ( regions where @xmath68 ) , given by the preceding formula , to the one of the other regions ( where it is supposed that @xmath27 ) , given by the expression  ( [ e.mn ] ) : @xmath70 adding these contributions is allowed here thanks to fuller s formula for writhe change during a deformation with fixed boundary conditions ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath66 is small , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq.t ] ) becomes dominant : the writhe is dominated by the loops contribution .",
    "@xmath62 is computed in the next section .",
    "( dashed line ) and mzard and bouchiat s ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "moroz and nelson s result is valid only for large forces  ( @xmath71 ) , validity range of mzard and bouchiat s is wider but fails for the lowest experimental force values , around  @xmath72 . the estimated contribution of loops is displayed as a dotted line ( see text ) .",
    "it corresponds to the best fit for  @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.t ] )  @xcite .",
    "the grey line is obtained from the same data set , but after removal of all configurations that have backward facing regions ; therefore there are no loops in this restricted ensemble .",
    "the results of mzard and bouchiat s model and the one presented in this letter have been obtained numerically , from equilibrated sets of 50.000 chains of 32  @xmath73 for each point , with discretisation @xmath74 , error bars are thiner than the line thickness .",
    "the two other curves are analytical expressions . [ f.wr ] ]    a monte - carlo simulation of semiflexible chains was performed ( described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the writhe angle of each configuration of the simulated equilibrated ensemble was computed , with both expressions  ( [ e.calu ] ) and  ( [ e.ful ] ) .",
    "it has been shown numerically that extra closure terms are negligible  @xcite .",
    "results are displayed in figure  [ f.wr ] .",
    "the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq.t ] ) is also displayed for the best value of @xmath75 ( one could conjecture that the geometric exact value be @xmath76 ) .",
    "the validity ranges estimated above appear reasonable , and the domains where different model agree are clearly observed .",
    "the distribution of writhe angle is _ gaussian _ , of width proportional to @xmath77 and centered around zero .",
    "the estimated loops contribution formula agrees quite well with the results and explains the difference to other models : it is not counted in one case and overestimated in the other one @xcite . if one removes the curves that have at least one backfacing region , which corresponds to the definition of a loop ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq.nf ] ) ) , one gets a curve similar to moroz and nelson s .",
    "the three models agree for @xmath78 , so the origin of model disagreement is located at low force .    the numerical results for the writhe angle displayed in figure  [ f.wr ] combined with the experimental data of references @xcite obtained at low force , in the elastic regime , give the value @xmath79 this value has to be compared with the ones given in the introduction .",
    "the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite was applied for forces below this value , in a domain where it overestimates the writhe fluctuations .",
    "the value obtained by moroz and nelson is the closest to the recent value of ref .",
    "it was obtained by eliminating data points obtained with a force lower than @xmath80 therefore in a domain where all models are equivalent .",
    "it is suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that applying a large force could lead to an overestimated value for  @xmath0 because of structural modifications of the double helix .",
    "this question is still open until now .",
    "unlike mzard and bouchiat s theory , neither moroz and nelson s model nor this work needs to be regularized by any cut - off .",
    "the value of this cut - off is difficult to relate to an independently measurable quantity .",
    "it is suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that a treatment of self - avoidance could be necessary .    in the low force regime , where the freely jointed chain model is valid for dna ,",
    "let us consider one molecule as a chain of sticks of length  @xmath32 and diameter @xmath81 .",
    "the molecule is located in a region of size @xmath82 . in the low force regime ,",
    "the sticks have almost random orientations , so excluded volume interactions can be estimated with the second virial coefficient .",
    "it follows that excluded volume interactions appear when @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the density of sticks .",
    "this gives @xmath85 .",
    "the length of the widely used @xmath86-phage dna is @xmath87@xcite . for larger forces",
    ", the molecule gets an orientation and self - avoidance effects are still smaller .",
    "it is established in ref .",
    "@xcite that self - avoidance effects can be neglected as long as @xmath88 .",
    "this argument does not apply as is in the present study since dna stores torsion .",
    "it is known , for example in the case of a plectoneme , that self - avoidance stabilizes some torque constrained configurations .",
    "i focused on the elastic regime , where the torque is small and in presence of a small but non - zero force , then applying a torque diminishes @xmath89 .",
    "in this situation , the assumption that has been made consists in considering self - avoidance negligible when  @xmath90 , or quantitatively when @xmath91 . as a consequence of self - avoidance the statistical weight of conformations with large writhe increases , in other words  @xmath62",
    "is underestimated in our model .",
    "consequently , taking into account self - avoidance effects would result in an small increase of the value of  @xmath0 given above .    in the numerical work , self - avoidance",
    "was not taken into account , following the considerations of the preceding paragraph . as a consequence ,",
    "the studied ensemble contains knotted configurations .",
    "i showed from the same numerical simulations that a @xmath92 long worm - like chain has a probability of @xmath93 to knot  @xcite . for a force of @xmath94",
    "the polymer statistic can be split into independent elastic blobs of size @xmath92 .",
    "then the probability to have a knot in at least one blob is around @xmath95 for a @xmath96 dna molecule . if the force is higher , the knot probability decreases , as blobs become smaller , and is negligible in the experimental force range .",
    "knotted configurations are then believed to play no role in the experimental force range .    in this work ,",
    "i have investigated the connections between different dna models and showed that moroz and nelson s model and mzard and bouchiat s are related in a simple way , which depends on how dna loops are taken into account .",
    "the estimates of the writhe fluctuations of the molecule in those models have been compared to numerical results .",
    "i have shown that the differences between those models are due to the absence ( in moroz and nelson s model ) or the overestimate ( in mzard and bouchiat s model ) of the contribution of the molecule loops to the writhe .",
    "this model takes more accurately writhe fluctuations into account whithout introducing any cut - off .",
    "it also provides a reasonable value for the torsional modulus of dna under small constraints .",
