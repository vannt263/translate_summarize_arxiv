    "random - matrix ensembles such as the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) and its cousins have attracted much attention in both the physics and mathematics community because of its many connections to statistical many - body theory , integrable systems , number theory and probability .",
    "this article is motivated by the study of gaussian matrix ensembles which incorporate spatial structure and thus are no longer mean field in character .",
    "these ensembles are sometimes called band gue models .",
    "they have the advantage of being mathematically more tractable than say random schrdinger operators and yet they are expected to share the same qualitative features .",
    "about twenty - five years ago , wegner @xcite introduced hyperbolic non - linear sigma models to study band gue models and disordered electron systems with @xmath2 orbitals per site . in the simplest case of these sigma models the hyperbolic ` spins ' indexed by lattice sites of @xmath3 take values in the hyperbolic plane @xmath0 equipped with its @xmath4-invariant geometry . soon thereafter , efetov @xcite extended wegner s work and introduced a class of supersymmetric non - linear sigma models .",
    "the supersymmetric formalism has the advantage of making it possible to perform the disorder average and rigorously convert random matrices to a problem in statistical mechanics . in particular , averages of products of green s functions become statistical mechanical correlation functions .",
    "the resulting problem is how to analyse such statistical mechanics systems .",
    "one of the main difficulties in this analysis is the non - compact hyperbolic symmetry identified by wegner which naturally arises when studying spectral and transport properties of disordered systems .",
    "this paper is devoted to showing that a certain class of @xmath1 sigma models can be effectively analysed in three dimensions by using horospherical coordinates and brascamp - lieb inequalities .",
    "let @xmath5 be a periodic box in @xmath3 ( centered at 0 ) with volume @xmath6 and define @xmath7 with @xmath8 to be the elements of a hermitian matrix drawn from the gue .",
    "thus the probability density is taken to be proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "now let @xmath10 be a symmetric matrix with positive entries @xmath11 which are small when the distance @xmath12 is large . then define a band matrix @xmath13 with matrix elements @xmath14 if we set @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 the laplacian of the lattice @xmath5 ) , then this corresponds to a band of width @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath11 has exponential decay @xmath18 .",
    "another convenient choice of @xmath10 is given as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is tiled by identical cubes of width @xmath17 .",
    "then define @xmath19 in both cases the matrix elements far from the diagonal are suppressed or vanish , and now the dimension of the lattice plays an important role .",
    "one expects that @xmath13 has qualitatively the features of a random schrdinger operator as we let the box @xmath5 approach @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , for the infinite - volume limit and fixed @xmath17 we know that @xmath13 has pure point spectrum ( and thus localization ) at all energies in one dimension , and in any dimension there is localization for energies in the lifshitz tails .",
    "large @xmath17 is expected to be roughly inversely proportional to the strength @xmath21 of the random potential .",
    "for example in one dimension the localization length is proportional to @xmath22 for the random schrdinger operator , and proportional to @xmath23 for a band random matrix @xcite .    for dimension @xmath24 , with @xmath10 given by ( [ 1.2 ] ) and large @xmath17",
    ", the average local density of states @xmath25 was studied using the supersymmetric formalism in the limit when @xmath26 goes to zero .",
    "@xmath27 was shown to be smooth for @xmath28 in an interval around zero and field correlations were proven to decay exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "to get information about time evolution or the behavior of the eigenstates , expectations like ( [ 1.4 ] ) are not sufficient .",
    "instead one must consider @xmath29 and study its behavior as @xmath26 goes to zero .",
    "if ( [ 1.5 ] ) remains bounded for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then the eigenstates near @xmath28 are extended in the sense that the @xmath32 norm of an @xmath33 normalized eigenstate goes to zero in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "what makes ( [ 1.5 ] ) more difficult to analyse than ( [ 1.4 ] ) is that the absolute value squared eliminates oscillations and small denominators are felt when @xmath26 is small .",
    "in fact , even in finite volume ( [ 1.4 ] ) does not diverge as @xmath26 goes to zero .",
    "however , ( [ 1.5 ] ) diverges roughly like @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the length over which the eigenfunctions are extended . roughly speaking",
    ", the hyperbolic symmetry emerges because the two green s functions in ( [ 1.5 ] ) have energies with imaginary parts of opposite signs .",
    "another feature of ( [ 1.5 ] ) is that the corresponding statistical mechanics model is not expected to decay rapidly in 3 dimensions but rather to exhibit a goldstone mode so that ( [ 1.5 ] ) should behave in the limit @xmath37 like @xmath38 , the green s function of the laplacian corresponding to diffusive time evolution .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to analyse wegner s non - linear sigma model ( for one replica ) as a component of efetov s supersymmetric model .",
    "more precisely we study a sigma model that arises in fyodorov s work @xcite .",
    "this model is formulated on a lattice , whereas wegner s model emerges upon taking a continuum limit .",
    "roughly speaking supersymmetric models of disordered quantum systems have three sectors : the boson - boson , fermion - fermion and boson - fermion sectors .",
    "the b - b sector has the hyperbolic symmetry ; this is the sector which we study . although the field in this sector may potentially diverge we show that for dimension @xmath39 , if @xmath40 , all moments of the field remain uniformly bounded",
    "this is the analogue ( in the sigma model approximation ) of the conjectured bound on ( [ 1.5 ] ) in @xmath41 .",
    "the f - f sector may also be studied in the sigma model approximation , and it corresponds to a classical heisenberg model taking values in the two - dimensional sphere . considered on its own , this sector has no divergence because of the compactness of the target . in three dimensions",
    ", the nearest neighbor heisenberg model has an ordered state which may be established by using infrared bounds .",
    "the main open problem which we do not address in this article is the b - f sector , which couples the other two sectors in a supersymmetric fashion .",
    "this must be understood to obtain a complete picture of the susy models .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that many phenomena of interest are already reflected in the sigma model analysed in this article .",
    "we now describe the hyperbolic sigma model which we shall analyse . in a periodic box @xmath42 ( not the @xmath5 of before , but the lattice of cubes that tile the original lattice ) , we associate to each lattice site @xmath43 a matrix @xmath44 where @xmath45 is subject to the conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus @xmath45 belongs to @xmath1 , and @xmath48 belongs to an adjoint orbit of @xmath1 , which may be identified with the symmetric space @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the isotropy subgroup generated by @xmath51 .",
    "the action or energy of a configuration @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the sum over pairs of nearest - neighbor sites of @xmath5 , and @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote an invariant measure on @xmath57 and define @xmath58 expectations in this model are given by @xmath59 note that by @xmath60 , the @xmath61-orbit @xmath62 can be identified with the positive hermitian matrices @xmath63 in @xmath64 .",
    "thus , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and we see that @xmath67 .",
    "since an @xmath64-symmetry emerges at @xmath68 , positivity of @xmath69 is needed to make the integrals exist .",
    "@xmath69 corresponds to a magnetic field and breaks the non - compact @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath50 .",
    "our main result may be stated as follows .",
    "[ thm1 ] for @xmath70 space dimensions there is a constant @xmath71 such that @xmath72 for all @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "if the @xmath1-symmetry were restored in the limit @xmath75 , the expectation of the unbounded observable @xmath76 would have to diverge in that limit .",
    "our result can therefore be viewed as a statement of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "( a more detailed discussion of what it means for a non - compact symmetry to be broken spontaneously has recently been given in @xcite . )",
    "higher moments of @xmath77 can also be bounded in @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath79 we expect ( but do not prove ) that the same kind of bound holds except that we must require @xmath80 with constants @xmath81 independent of @xmath82 .",
    "our proof can easily be extended to finite - range interactions for large @xmath82 ; however , for technical reasons it does not easily extend to infinite - range interactions .    in the next section",
    "we shall explain the relation between the band random matrices and the sigma models described above .",
    "roughly speaking , the magnetic field @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath26 , the imaginary part of the energy in ( [ 1.5 ] ) , and @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath23 , the square of the band width . in @xmath83 , the action ( [ 1.7 ] ) just describes a random walk on @xmath84 indexed by time @xmath85 .    in the sigma - model approximation",
    "we shall see that @xmath86 here again we identify @xmath69 with @xmath87 .",
    "the extra factors of the inverse determinant appear because we have not included the f - f and f - b sectors .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] relies on the use of horospherical coordinates @xmath88 to parametrize @xmath89 ( for the details see sect .",
    "[ sect : coords ] ) .",
    "the action in these coordinates is @xmath90 the gibbs measure now takes the form @xmath91 .",
    "note that @xmath92 is convex in @xmath93 and quadratic in @xmath94 .",
    "( we mention in passing that the bakry - emery tensor @xmath95 for @xmath92 is not positive in the natural hyperbolic geometry . ) one of the key advantages of the horospherical coordinates is that we can integrate out the @xmath94 variables thereby producing an effective action @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath73 we prove that the hessian of @xmath96 is positive , and in fact as quadratic forms we prove @xmath97 with @xmath16 the discrete laplacian .",
    "now the brascamp - lieb inequality may be applied to control fluctuations of the @xmath98 in terms of @xmath99 .",
    "this is bounded in three dimensions provided @xmath100 . in one or two dimensions",
    "one must require ( [ 1.10 ] ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sect.[sect : origin ] we describe the relation of the sigma model ( [ 1.7 ] ) to the random band model described by ( [ 1.3 ] ) following ideas of fyodorov .",
    "horospherical coordinates are introduced in sect .",
    "[ sect : coords ] and convexity of the effective action is proved in sect .",
    "[ sect : int_s ] .",
    "the brascamp - lieb inequality together with a ward identity are used in sect .",
    "[ sect : bl_ineq ] to obtain bounds on the @xmath93 fields .",
    "the remaining sects .",
    "[ sect : bounds ] and [ sect : adjust ] explain how to control the @xmath94 field fluctuations and the @xmath69-regularization .",
    "there are a number of open questions related to this paper .",
    "the primary one is to determine whether there are analogous bounds for more general hyperbolic sigma models such as those of higher rank .",
    "there are also problems involving averages of green s functions which are not uniformly elliptic .",
    "note that @xmath94 correlations are expressed in terms of @xmath101 since the @xmath93 fields are not bounded from below , the green s function ( [ 1.14 ] ) is not uniformly elliptic .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath93 fields is given by the convex effective action @xmath102 .",
    "although we obtain good bounds on ( [ 1.14 ] ) for the diagonal @xmath103 , the off - diagonal bounds obtained by our methods are not sharp .",

    "we now review how the non - linear sigma model , ( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.8 ] ) , arises from the problem of computing green s function averages for some ensembles of band random matrices . aside from putting our analysis on a solid footing in random - matrix theory and disordered electron physics , this review will explain the origin of the hyperbolic target space @xmath0 and its riemannian geometry .",
    "readers interested only in mathematical results , not in physical motivation and background , are invited to skip the present section ; the remainder of the paper does not depend on it .",
    "let @xmath104 be a periodic box as before , and assign to every site @xmath105 one copy @xmath106 of an @xmath2-dimensional unitary vector space .",
    "( physically speaking we are assigning @xmath2 valence electron orbitals to every atom of a solid with hypercubic lattice structure . )",
    "the finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath107 of the random - matrix model to be specified is the orthogonal sum @xmath108 the basic framework we have in mind is single - electron quantum mechanics , and our goal is to establish control over the spectral and transport properties of certain ensembles of random hamiltonians @xmath13 .",
    "we shall take the hamiltonians to be elements of @xmath109 , the space of hermitian operators on @xmath107 .",
    "a random - matrix model is now defined by a probability distribution on @xmath109 .",
    "equivalently , one may specify the fourier transform or characteristic function : @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the expectation value w.r.t .  the probability distribution for the random hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "the fourier variable is some other element @xmath112 .    for simplicity we shall restrict ourselves to the case of gaussian distributions with zero mean , @xmath113 .",

    "@xmath117 are real , symmetric , and non - negative ( they must also be positive semi - definite as a quadratic form ) .",
    "the choice ( [ 2.2 ] ) also implies that all matrix entries of @xmath13 are statistically independent .",

    "@xmath5 , the number of orbitals @xmath2 , and the variances @xmath117 , one obtains a large class of hermitian random - matrix models . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath122 denotes a distance function for @xmath5 , and @xmath123 is a rapidly decreasing positive function on @xmath124 of width @xmath17 , the choice @xmath125 gives an ensemble of band random matrices with band width @xmath17 and symmetry group @xmath126 .",
    "there exist two distinct situations where such a random - matrix ensemble is expected to exhibit metallic behavior ( in dimension @xmath41 ) and efficient methods of analysis are available .",
    "the first one occurs when the width @xmath17 is large ( and , say , @xmath127 ) .",
    "this case is dealt with by the schfer - wegner method @xcite ; it will not be considered further in the present paper ( see however @xcite for a recent review of that method ) .    the second one is called the ` granular model ' . there ,",
    "@xmath128 and the diagonal of the variance matrix @xmath117 dominates the off - diagonal : @xmath129 each atom @xmath105 here is to be viewed as a grain , or small metallic particle , housing a large number @xmath2 of electron states , and the squared matrix elements for tunneling between grains ( @xmath117 for @xmath130 ) are small compared to the intra - grain matrix elements @xmath131 .",
    "the appropriate method to use in this case is that of fyodorov ( sect .",
    "[ sect : fyodorov ] ) .",
    "metallic behavior is expected to occur when the coefficients @xmath132 are not too small .",
    "another ( perhaps more familiar ) way of defining the class of granular models is to say that one starts from matrices @xmath13 drawn from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) of matrix dimension @xmath133 , and then multiplies the variances of all matrix elements of @xmath13 connecting @xmath134 with @xmath135 by the positive number @xmath117 .",
    "this is the same as the model ( [ 1.3 ] ) described in the introduction , with @xmath2 being equal to the volume of the cubes tiling the lattice .",
    "fixing some lattice site @xmath136 , let @xmath137 be the average absolute square of the @xmath138 part of the green s function with complex energy @xmath139 : @xmath140 physicists have developed an approximation scheme that calculates disorder averages such as this one by relating them to the correlation functions of a supersymmetric non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "here we shall address the related , but somewhat simpler problem that arises from considering @xmath141 note that @xmath142 can be viewed as the average squared green s function for a _ deformed _ ensemble , where the probability distribution for the hamiltonian @xmath13 is modified by multiplying it with @xmath143 inverse powers of @xmath144 .",
    "inserting these factors modifies the original problem , and it is far from clear how much bearing the results for @xmath145 will have on the case @xmath146 .",
    "( physicists often use a procedure called the replica trick , where one attempts to infer the answer for @xmath146 by analytic continuation from the answer for @xmath147 .",
    "we will make no such attempt here . ) however , even if the @xmath145 situation was quite unrelated to @xmath146 , analysing it would still be a necessary step toward establishing mathematical control over the full supersymmetric theory at @xmath146 .",
    "the reason is that efetov s supersymmetric non - linear sigma model has the effective theory of @xmath142 at @xmath148 for its non - compact bosonic sector .    in order to express @xmath149",
    "we introduce a pair of complex fields @xmath150 where @xmath151 .",

    "the scalar product is given by @xmath154 if @xmath155 is a matrix or linear operator acting on @xmath107 with @xmath156 , we normalize our gaussian integrals over @xmath157 such that @xmath158 for fixed @xmath159 and @xmath5 define the quadratic form @xmath160 note that @xmath161 and the integral over @xmath157 is therefore defined : @xmath162 and @xmath163    for general @xmath164 if we set @xmath165 , this produces the factor @xmath166 and permits us to study more complicated observables involving several green s functions .",
    "now we can calculate the average of @xmath167 over the randomness in @xmath13 by using ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "first consider @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "for general @xmath171 , @xmath172 is replaced by the diagonal matrix @xmath173 .",
    "note that the @xmath174 matrices @xmath175 are hermitian and non - negative ; we say they lie in @xmath176 .",
    "following fyodorov @xcite we choose the matrices @xmath175 as our integration variables , i.e. , we push forward the measure over the @xmath157 to a measure over the non - negative matrices @xmath63 .",
    "the push forward may be singular .",
    "however , if @xmath177 then the push forward has a density ( derived in appendix a ) given by @xmath178 where @xmath179 denotes a ( suitably normalized ) lebesgue measure on @xmath180 . now set @xmath181 then we obtain fyodorov s formula for @xmath182 ( for general @xmath171 ) in the form @xmath183 where the integral is over the configurations @xmath184 with @xmath185 for all @xmath105 .",
    "the formulation ( [ 2.10 ] ) offers a transparent view of the symmetries of the problem .",
    "indeed , let @xmath186 be the pseudo - unitary group of complex @xmath174 matrices @xmath187 with inverse @xmath188 .",
    "this group acts as a transformation group on the matrices @xmath189 by @xmath190 clearly , the integration domain for @xmath191 of fyodorov s formula ( [ 2.10 ] ) is invariant under that group action . since @xmath192 for @xmath193 , the same holds true for the integration density @xmath194 . from @xmath195",
    "one sees that the function being integrated in ( [ 2.10 ] ) becomes invariant under the @xmath186 group action when the parameter @xmath87 is taken to zero .",
    "thus @xmath186 transformations are global symmetries in that limit .    in what follows we focus on the case @xmath148 , where the symmetry group is @xmath196 or , what amounts to essentially the same , @xmath1 .",
    "the exact integral representation ( [ 2.10 ] ) is well suited for further analysis in the granular limit which we now consider .",
    "thus we now assume @xmath128 , @xmath197 for @xmath198 , @xmath199 for @xmath200 , and @xmath201 let us first consider the diagonal terms of the action ( [ 2.10 ] ) : @xmath202 the matrices @xmath203 may be expressed as @xmath204 where @xmath205 , @xmath206 are positive real numbers , and @xmath207 is determined only up to right multiplication by an arbitrary element in @xmath208 .",

    "the action function of our model now is @xmath222 with @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "similarly , by using ( [ m 2.7 ] ) and ( [ saddle m_j ] ) , the observable appearing in ( [ obs 2.5 ] ) is proportional to @xmath225 in the sigma - model approximation .",
    "the @xmath1-invariant measure @xmath226 is renamed to @xmath227 .    in order to eliminate the sigma - model approximation",
