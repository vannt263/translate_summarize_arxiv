    "impurities play a dual role in transport properties of unconventional superconductors .",
    "they scatter the carriers responsible for the transport .",
    "this effect decreases the transport coefficients . on the other hand , impurities are pair - breaking and so generate new excitations which contribute to the transport . under suitable circumstances ,",
    "these two effects exactly cancel with each other and give rise to universal transport coefficients , independent of the concentration or other properties specifying the impurities .",
    "this was first discussed theoretically by p. a. lee @xcite for the ( low temperature finite frequency ) electrical conductivity in high temperature cuprate superconductors with @xmath5 order parameter .",
    "subsequently , the author and his collaborators extended this result to _ thermal conductivity _",
    "( as well as other quantities such as ultrasonic attenuation coefficients ) and also for other nodal superconductors @xcite .",
    "these universal transport coefficients apply at the low temperature , low frequency ( temperature and frequency small compared with impurity band width @xmath2 ) regime , which for definiteness will be referred to as _ gapless _",
    "( in analogy with the corresponding regime for conventional superconductors with magnetic impurities ) . this _",
    "universal thermal conductivity _ has played an extremely useful role in deducing the nodal structures of unconventional superconductors ( see , e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the success of this is partly due to the absence of impurity vertex corrections of these transport coefficients under many circumstances @xcite , and even when these corrections are present , may give rise only to a relatively small contribution @xcite .",
    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , a superconductor with similar crystal structure to the cuprate superconductors with also basically only two - dimensional dispersing bands , has long been proposed to be a superconductor with a chiral order parameter breaking time - reversal and reflection symmetries ( see @xcite for a review ) , though the actual form of the order parameter is far from certain and highly controversial , with the situation further complicated by the presence of three conduction bands at the fermi level .",
    "initially it was proposed that the order parameter has the momentum dependence @xmath6 , and is fully gapped .",
    "however , numerous experiments such as specific heat @xcite , have shown that this superconductor has low lying excitations .",
    "thus the order parameter possesses nodes , or at least momentum directions where there are strong suppressions of the gap , which we shall referred to as  near - nodes \" .",
    "in particular , thermal conductivity at the zero temperature limit is as expected from the theory of superconductor with line nodes @xcite ( point nodes if we regard the system as two - dimensional ) .",
    "these line nodes or near - nodes have been attributed to the momentum dependence of the spin fluctuation responsible for the pairing , proximity to the brillouin zone boundary , spin - orbit couplings , or combinations there - of @xcite .",
    "we note here that these nodes or near - nodes are not necessarily associated with sign change of the order parameter : indeed no such sign change is needed at least for the scenario in @xcite where the ( near-)node occurs for the band labeled by @xmath2 ( not to be confused with the impurity band width ) at momenta near the zone boundaries ( no bands are believed to actually cross or touch the zone boundaries ) .    for a chiral superconductor , off - diagonal elements in transport coefficients such as hall conductivity",
    "are symmetry allowed",
    ". if the electrical hall conductivity of a system is finite , then an electric field in the say , x - direction can produce an electric current along the y - direction , or vice versa . similarly , one can also have hall thermal conductivity where a temperature gradient along x produces an energy current along y in addition to one along x. however the existence of such hall transport coefficients turns out to be tricky .",
    "( consider the simplest example of a clean superconductor with a quadratic normal state dispersion .",
    "a uniform electric field can only accelerate the system as a whole and hence the electric hall conductivity must be identically zero @xcite ) .",
    "thermal hall conductivity of chiral superconducting states has in fact been examined theoretically long time ago by arfi _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "these authors confined themselves to the case where quasiparticles are well - defined ( thus at temperatures large compared with the impurity band - width mentioned above ) . here once again impurities play an important role .",
    "considering isotropic scatterers , these authors have shown that the hall thermal conductivity arises entirely from the  in \"- scattering term of the collision integral .",
    "in addition to breaking time - reversal and reflection symmetries , one must break particle - hole symmetry as well .",
    "the impurities once again provide the necessary mechanism , if the scattering phase shift @xmath7 of the impurities is not a multiple of @xmath8 . for chiral superconductors",
    ", these authors only examined a three - dimensional superconductor with order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this superconductor is fully gapped near the basal plane , with two nodes in the north and south poles which however contribute little to transport at low temperatures .",
    "not surprising they obtain a hall thermal conductivity which is very small at low temperatures .    returning to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , a ( basically ) two - dimensional superconductor with line nodes and ( probably ) an order parameter with chiral symmetry , it is therefore highly interesting to evaluate theoretically the expected thermal hall conductivity . furthermore , given the observed universal thermal conductivity at low temperatures , it is important to examine this thermal hall conductivity in this corresponding gapless regime , where only the excitations near the nodes contribute to the thermal transport .",
    "we report such a calculation here , employing the quasiclassical method as in @xcite .",
    "this thermal hall conductivity arises from the corrections to the impurity self - energies ( corresponding to vertex corrections in the response function language and in - scattering in the boltzmann kinetic equation approach ) .",
    "while it vanishes for very weak ( @xmath10 or integral multiples of @xmath11 ) or very strong scatterers ( @xmath12 modulo @xmath11 ) , under favorable circumstances it is smaller than the universal diagonal thermal conductivity only by the factor @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is the maximum gap , and @xmath2 the impurity band width .",
    "since this is only logarithmically small , this quantity may be experimentally measurable .",
    "the existence of this thermal hall conductivity would be a strong indication that the superconductor is indeed a chiral superconductor .",
    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a multi - band superconductor .",
    "the normal state has three bands @xmath14 ( not to be confused with the impurity scale mentioned above ) at the fermi level .",
    "there are some controversies on which band dominates the thermodynamic or transport properties , and how much each band contributes to each quantity ( compare e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity , we shall present the calculation for a single band superconductor , assuming that it possesses a chiral but nodal ( or nearly nodal ) order parameter .",
    "the observed universal thermal conductivity can be explained if there are line nodes ( or nearly nodes ) on each of the three bands , or if say the @xmath2-band dominates the transport with this band alone having a line node . for either case however our calculation below gives a semi - quantitative prediction of the thermal hall conductivity , assuming that each band contributes to this quantity in parallel and hence the total is simply given by the sum of the contribution from each band .",
    "if a particular band is fully gapped and has a gap magnitude large compared with the impurity scale @xmath2 , then that band would have no contribution to the thermal transport at low temperatures .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "present first the general formulation , before specifying to a particular form of the gap .",
    "we then estimate the thermal hall conductivity .",
    "contains a discussion and summary . evaluates also the vertex corrections to the diagonal thermal conductivity , while contains discussions for more general forms of the gap",
    "our calculation is an extension of @xcite , and we would employ similar notations except otherwise stated ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we shall assume that the order parameter is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 transforming as a two - dimensional representation under the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal .",
    "here we have taken a simple momentum independent spin structure of the order parameter @xmath17 implying that we have only up - down pairing .",
    "some recent models @xcite suggest that this is too simplistic but relaxing this assumption is expected only to give rise to some slightly different numerical factors for our main results : see below .",
    "to simply our presentation we shall also take a cylindrical fermi surface : generalizations to angular dependent density of states and fermi velocities are straight - forward but would make notations rather clumsy ( it is here worth remembering that the low temperature transport must be dominated by contributions near the nodes ) . for @xmath16 above , we take the model    _ x ( p ) & = & _ m  _ * p *  _ x(_*p * ) + _ y ( p ) & = & _ m  _ * p *  _ y(_*p * ) [ dx ] where @xmath18 is the azimuthal angle of the momentum direction @xmath19 . for simplicity we shall often leave out the subscript @xmath19 for @xmath20 . without the @xmath21 factors , the magnitude of the gap at any @xmath19 is given by @xmath22 , our maximal gap . to provide a model consistent with universal thermal conductivity ,",

    "( e.g. , @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) if @xmath195 ) .",
    "it seems that this _ sign _ of the thermal hall conductivity can be understood in the same manner as the edge state contributions @xcite mentioned above .",
    "consider extended impurities ( rather than point impurities in our calculations ) within the sample .",
    "a repulsive potential inside the sample has edge states propagating down ( @xmath189 ) on its left but up on its right .",
    "the opposite situation applies if the potential is attractive .",
    "if the sample is hotter on the left and cooler on the right ( @xmath196 ) , the edge states near the attractive ( repulsive ) potential wells would generates a net heat current along @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) , if we have many such potential wells ( barriers ) such that these bounds states overlap so that the heat can propagate through the sample .",
    "now for point impurities with attractive ( repulsive ) potentials , @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "( more precisely our argument is restricted to @xmath195 for attractive potentials and @xmath198 for repulsive potentials .",
    "note however if say @xmath199 , scattering behavior of particles by the attractive potential is as if the scattering were from a repulsive potential with @xmath200 . )",
    "we thus see that the sign of the thermal hall conductivities we obtained are of the same sign as what we have if the potentials are extended .",
    "arfi et al discussed the state @xmath201 . in their plots , they give @xmath202 with phase shifts @xmath203 , thus with a sign opposite to the present results .",
    "the author has not yet been able to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "in this paper , we have evaluated the @xmath204 thermal hall conductivity for a chiral superconductor where there are momentum directions with strong gap suppression , assuming simple isotropic impurities .",
    "we find that the value of this thermal hall conductivity can be a significant fraction of the diagonal universal component .",
    "detection of this thermal hall conductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 would be a strong proof that the superconductor possesses a chiral p - wave order parameter .",
    "this experimental measurement can however be quite challenging , as it would require a sample with a single domain order parameter . at this moment",
    ", there are quite some uncertainties about the domain sizes @xcite in this superconductor , but measurement techniques applicable to small system sizes would definitely help here",
    ".    we have only considered isotropic impurities , and have ignored possible anisotropic scattering by the impurities , spin - orbit couplings both for the bulk and the impurity scattering .",
    "it is entirely feasible that these would also generate a finite thermal hall conductivity , provided the superconducting order parameter breaks time - reversal and inversion symmetry .",
    "the investigation of these possibilities however must be left for the future .",
    "this research is supported by the ministry of science and technology of taiwan under grant numbers nsc 101 - 2112-m-001 - 021-my3 and most 104 - 2112-m-001 - 006-my3 .",
    "though not directly related to the central theme of this paper , we here investigate further the vertex corrections @xmath205 to the diagonal terms of the thermal conductance , as we do not find much calculations of this in the literature , with the exception of @xcite for the @xmath206 superconductor and the specific model of internodal scattering .",
    "the needed expression is already given in .",
    "for simplicity we shall confine ourselves only to the born and resonance limits . again eliminating @xmath118 in favor of @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and setting @xmath207 , we get ( using @xmath208 , note that in this limit , the second and third terms in dominates ) ( ( - ) _ x^2 [ kxxvb ] we see that this is positive definite , that is , the thermal conductivity becomes larger than the universal value when this vertex correction is included . using the approximate formulas and we get k_xx^v / k_xx^ns 1 / ( 2 _ m/ ) [ kxxvb2 ] on the other hand , in the resonance limit , we get instead - ( + ) _ x^2 [ kxxvr ] this is then negative . using the approximate values discussed before",
    "we get - 1 / 3 ( 2 _ m/ ) [ kxxvr2 ] the above mentioned sign change in vertex corrections do not seem to have been noted before in the literature .",
    "durst and lee @xcite , who did investigate the vertex corrections for a model of internodal scattering in @xmath161 superconductor , did not mention such possibility of sign change .",
    "it is difficult to compare our calculations with @xcite since the model are quite different .",
    "however , we do note here that the coefficients defined in their ( 3.17a ) and ( 3.17b ) entering their expression for the vertex correction ( 4.25 ) for thermal conductivity also consist of two terms appearing as differences , so a sign change may not be out of the question .",
    "for definiteness , in the text we have introduced a specific model for the functions @xmath21 to introduce near - line nodes in the gap .",
    "we shall now argue that many of our results are basically unchanged for other forms of @xmath21 so long as we still have near - line nodes , provide some rather weak conditions remain satisfied .",
    "thus the results given in the text are quite general .",
    "for example , our results are directly applicable to the case where @xmath134 in fig [ fig1 ] in the region @xmath151 is not directly proportional to @xmath20 but rather have a form say @xmath209 , which is still linear in @xmath20 but extrapolate rather to a finite value at @xmath147 . if the angular averages in , , , etc are still dominated by the contributions where the gap is linear in @xmath20 , these equations are then essentially unchanged and our estimate for the thermal hall conductivities remain valid . with the same reasoning , @xmath137 and @xmath210 can have additional sign changes as functions of @xmath20 so long as the above mentioned integrals are dominated by the linear regions , in particular @xmath211 as a function of @xmath20 can have winding number larger than @xmath114 , so long as the angular average , which involves @xmath212 is non - zero .",
    "( for example , if @xmath213 and @xmath214 , then the vertex corrections would vanish for isotropic fermi surface and so @xmath129 would become zero .",
    "however , for more general forms of @xmath215 so that @xmath216 or the magnitude @xmath153 is not a constant in @xmath20 , is in general finite even if @xmath215 still has winding number @xmath217 or other odd numbers ) .",
    "our calculations are valid also for the near nodes are located along @xmath218 and @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "this is because we are only evaluating linear response and we could have use coordinates @xmath222 and @xmath223 for our calculations in text .",
    "tetragonal symmetry implies that @xmath224 and @xmath225 etc . hence our estimates for the thermal conductance should also be applicable for the models in e.g. @xcite .",
    "though not the main concern of the present paper , we discuss here also the @xmath204 thermal conductance for a two - dimensional chiral superconductor with full isotropic gap , with @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the required angular averages are trivial in the @xmath157 limit .",
    "we have v_fx^2 v_f^2   [ buap ] hence , [ bkxx ] which is no longer universal , and is smaller than the text for the case of a nodal or near - nodal superconductor by a factor of @xmath228 . furthermore , / _",
    "m  , _ x = _ y [ blxap ] and [ bdx2ap ] we can verify that @xmath112 defined in is again @xmath229 and @xmath230 in the born and resonant limit respectively . suppressing again this numerical constant ,",
    "we obtain if @xmath231 , then it turns out that @xmath232 .",
    "similarly , one can verify that @xmath205 becomes the same order as @xmath179 ."
