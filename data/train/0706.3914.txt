    "in the thirties , the dimer model was introduced to mimic the adsorption of diatomic molecules on a crystal surface @xcite .",
    "later , this model was applied in the study of many other physical systems as ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the dimers can be modeled as chains with two basic units called monomers , occupying first neighbor sites of a lattice .",
    "a central question in the study of this model is to enumerate the number of ways to place @xmath4 dimers on lattice with @xmath5 sites , such that the density of monomers is given by @xmath6 . the special case of full occupancy , where @xmath7 , was exactly solved for planar lattices , using a technique based on pfaffians @xcite .",
    "however , the more general case @xmath8 , the so called monomer - dimer problem , is still an open question .",
    "recently , an analytic solution was obtained for the case where there is a single vacancy at a certain site on the boundary of a two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in a previous work , two of us used the transfer matrix approach to calculate the entropy of flexible chains with @xmath0 monomers , that we call @xmath0-mers , as a function of the density @xmath9 of sites of the lattice occupied by monomers @xcite .",
    "since only the infinite energy related to the excluded volume interaction is considered , this is an athermal problem .",
    "the entropy was calculated through a numerically exact procedure for the model defined on stripes of finite widths @xmath10 and infinite length , with periodical boundary conditions in the transverse direction .",
    "the sequence of results for stripes of finite widths was then extrapolated to the two - dimensional limit by means of finite - size scaling procedures .    by using computational methods and the asymptotic theory of pemantle and wilson @xcite , kong @xcite , obtained , among other results , exact asymptotic expansions for the entropy of the dimers placed on stripes in the high density region .",
    "it may be appropriate to mention that the free energy @xmath11 defined by kong is actually the adimensional entropy per lattice site @xmath12 , which is related to the helmholtz free energy of the system through @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant and we have set the constant internal energy of the system equal to zero .",
    "he observed that the amplitude of the first term in this expansion depends on the parity of the lattice width , @xmath10 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 the asymptotic behavior of the free energy in the low density limit @xmath17 was also studied by kong in the monomer - dimer problem @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to consider how the asymptotic results found by kong are generalized if chains with more than two monomers are considered . in this work , using the transfer matrix approach to calculate the entropy for finite stripes with width @xmath10 , we obtain estimates for the amplitude @xmath18 not only for the dimer case , but also for larger chains @xmath19 .",
    "we find that in general expression ( [ asympt ] ) describes well the behavior of @xmath20 in the high density limit , but the number of different values of the amplitude , as well as their numerical values , change as chains with different molecular weights @xmath0 are considered .",
    "also , we study the low density limit for the same values of @xmath0 mentioned before .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ calc ]",
    "we present the expressions used to estimate the amplitudes @xmath18 and we discuss how the transfer matrix for the problem is defined and obtained . the numerical results may be found in section [ num ] and the conclusions are presented in section [ con ] .",
    "although it is rather natural to study the system in the canonical ensemble , where the number of monomers on the lattice is fixed , to apply the transfer matrix technique it is convenient to allow this number to fluctuate .",
    "we thus define the grand - canonical partition function as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the activity of a monomer and @xmath23 is the number of ways to place @xmath4 chains with @xmath0 monomers each on the lattice with @xmath5 sites .",
    "the density of monomers may be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the thermodynamic potential per lattice site , defined as @xmath26    in the thermodynamic limit we may use a legendre transformation to rewrite the potential as @xmath27 which implies that @xmath28 and therefore the entropy will be given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "now , we may attempt to generalize the high density expansion for dimers and suppose that the behavior of the entropy in this region is given by the expression @xmath31 thus , using the equation ( [ fen ] ) we obtain @xmath32 deriving this last equation with respect to @xmath9 , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "this expression was useful to obtain evidences that for all cases we studied the asymptotic behavior supposed in equation ( [ rela ] ) is valid , allowing us to estimate the amplitudes @xmath35      to build the transfer matrix for this problem we define a stripe of width @xmath10 on the square lattice in the plane @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the position of a site may be defined by @xmath36 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are integer numbers .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed in both directions . generalizing the prescription due to",
    "derrida @xcite for the transfer matrix of an infinite chain placed in stripes , we define the state of a set of @xmath10 vertical bonds of the lattice connecting the sites at @xmath41 to the sites at @xmath42 specifying the number of monomers already connected to this bond located on sites with @xmath43 ( in the range @xmath44 $ ] ) and the pairs of bonds which are connected to each other by a chain whose monomers are all located at sites with @xmath43 .",
    "this last information is essential to prevent the presence of rings in the allowed configurations . with the information above about the configuration of the vertical bonds located between @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ", we may find all possible configurations of the vertical bonds between @xmath42 and @xmath45 , thus defining a transfer matrix .",
    "actually , it is not difficult to develop an algorithm for the steps involved in this procedure , which allows us to obtain the elements of the transfer matrix exactly .",
    "restriction in memory and computer time set an upper limit to the values of @xmath10 and @xmath0 we are able to handle , since the size of the transfer matrix grows very fast as they increase .",
    "more details about this procedure may be found in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "once the transfer matrix @xmath46 is obtained , we may find the entropy in the thermodynamic limit using the largest eigenvalue of this matrix @xmath47 .",
    "the grand - canonical partition function is related to the transfer matrix by the expression @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the length of the stripe and we adopt periodical boundary contitions in the longitudinal direction as well .",
    "the density of monomers in the thermodynamic limit @xmath50 , @xmath51 , will then be given by @xmath52 thus , using the expressions ( [ eq ] ) and ( [ rhoz ] ) and supposing that the behavior in the high density limit of the entropy for chains with @xmath0 monomers is given by the relation ( [ rela ] ) , we may estimate the amplitudes @xmath18 for the set the molecular weights @xmath0 widths of the stripe @xmath10 we were able to handle .",
    "a roughly exponential growth of the size of the transfer matrix with both the molecular weight @xmath0 and the width of the stripe @xmath10 prevents us from obtaining results for larger chains or stripes . in this paper",
    "we show results for chains with molecular weight ranging between 2 and 9 and widths of the stripes ranging between 2 and 12 ( dimers case ) and 2 ( @xmath53 case ) .",
    "first , we analyze the high density limit behavior of the entropy for the molecular weights and widths of the stripes mentioned .",
    "later , we will turn our attention to the low density limit for the same cases . for each pair of values for @xmath10 and @xmath0",
    ", we obtain the elements of the transfer matrix using the algorithm mentioned above in a numerically exact fashion .",
    "then , we take advantage of the @xmath54 symmetry of the states and use the power method to find the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath47 and its derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "we start with our results for dimers , which are in agreement with the values obtained by kong @xcite , with @xmath55 , if @xmath10 is odd and @xmath56 , if @xmath10 is even , as is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .     for dimers ( @xmath1 ) . at left panel the widths of the stripes",
    "are even values ranging between @xmath57 , while at right panel results for odd values of the widths between @xmath58 are displayed .",
    "the dashed lines indicates slopes equal to the known value of @xmath18 in each case . ]    for chains with @xmath59 ( trimers ) , our results also lead to two values of the amplitude : @xmath60 for widths that are multiples of 3 and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "our results for tetramers @xmath61 show three values for the amplitude @xmath18 , @xmath62 finally , in the case @xmath63 ( pentamers ) , we found @xmath64 , if @xmath10 is a multiple of 5 and @xmath55 , in all other cases",
    ". unfortunately , in this case we only were able to consider widths up to @xmath65 , due to computational limitations caused by the fast growth of the transfer matrix with @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath22 become very large and this makes the numerical errors in the calculations grow . finally , we extend our analysis to the polymer case ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the entropy for this case shows different finite size scaling corrections for even and odd widths . nevertheless , the data show a single amplitude @xmath55 in this limit , as may be seen in figure [ fig3 ] .    ,",
    "in which only one amplitude @xmath55 was found for all widths studied ( @xmath75).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we may conclude that the results shown above suggest that the dependence of the entropy with the width of the stripe obtained by kong for the dimer model may be extended for larger chains , including more possibilities for the amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "apparently , the values of the amplitude are related to the split of the leading eigenvalues of the transfer matrix into subsets with different finite size scaling behaviors found in @xcite .",
    "these splits seem to be related to frustration effects in the limit of full occupancy .",
    "an empirical rule that we found to label these subsets is the determination of an integer @xmath76 which minimizes the relation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the smallest integer for which a solution is found .",
    "the widths associated to the same value of @xmath76 share the same estimate of the amplitude , as may be seen in table [ tab ] . another way to look at relation ( [ alprel ] )",
    "is to rewrite it as @xmath79 , so that @xmath76 is the numerator of the fraction @xmath80 after it is simplified .",

    "the number of chains we can place in this rectangle is @xmath78 .",
    "we notice that if @xmath0 is prime , we find @xmath81 for all widths @xmath10 which are not multiples of @xmath0 , while @xmath82 if @xmath10 is a multiple of @xmath0 . in general , the number of different values for @xmath76 is equal to the number of divisors of @xmath0 , including 1 and @xmath0 itself .",

    "all results for chains with molecular weights @xmath85 are consistent with the conjecture for the amplitudes @xmath18 .",
    "there are cases , like @xmath86 , @xmath87 , where numerical errors prevented us from obtaining results at densities high enough to observe the asymptotic behavior .",
    "an example where the asymptotic regime also was reached only at very high densities may be seen in results for @xmath59 , @xmath88 in figure [ fig2 ] . as a consequence of these limitations ,",
    "only some of the possible values for the amplitude @xmath18 are observed in the results for chains with larger molecular weight presented in figure [ fig4 ] .     between 6 and 9 , in increasing values from left to right .",
    "the observed values of the amplitudes are consistent with the conjecture made in the text . ]      in the low density limit @xmath89 , kong @xcite obtained from an asymptotic expansion the following behavior for the entropy of dimers placed in a stripe with width @xmath10 , @xmath90 the expression above resembles the one predicted by the mean - field approximation @xcite , which is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the coordination number . for small values of the density @xmath9 ,",
    "the leading contribution comes from the second term , which for dimers is identical to the one obtained by kong .",
    "it is then rather natural to conjecture that for other values of @xmath0 the leading contribution to the entropy is the one predicted by the mean field approximation , since for small densities the interchain interactions may be neglected .",
    "thus , we conjecture that for all values of the molecular weights in the low density limit we have the asymptotic behavior @xmath93    in order to test expression ( [ ldb ] ) in the low density limit , we built curves for different molecular weights and widths of stripes .",
    "our results , as shown in the figure [ fig5 ] , are consistent with the conjecture for all the chains analyzed here , since curves of @xmath94 as a function of @xmath95 are linear with a slope equal to 1 in all cases .     varying between @xmath1 and @xmath86 . in all cases , independently of the width analyzed ,",
    "we observe linear relations with slope @xmath96 ( indicated by the dashed line ) , satisfying the mean - field prediction . ]",
    "in this work , we study the asymptotic behavior of the entropy for chains placed on stripes using the transfer matrix approach . generalizing the results by kong @xcite for the case of dimers in the high density limit , we conjecture similar asymptotic forms for the entropy of chains with larger molecular weights .",
    "we propose an empirical rule to determine the number of different amplitudes of the asymptotic behavior close to the full occupancy limit , as well as to find the values of these amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , computational limitations prevent us from studying larger chains and larger widths .",
    "however , it seems reasonable expect that our results apply also to other cases .",
    "an analytic approach similar to the one made by kong @xcite , using the pemantle - wilson asymptotic theory @xcite would be very useful to support our conclusions .",
    "however , it may not be easy to carry out this task for chains with molecular weight larger than @xmath1 .",
    "another interesting result is that in the low density limit the free energy is well fitted by the mean - field approximation @xcite , for any width @xmath10 for all the values of @xmath0 we were able to consider .",
    "again , it would be interesting to obtain an exact result in this limit in order to verify this conclusion .",
