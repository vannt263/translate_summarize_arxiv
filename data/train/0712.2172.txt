    "<S> we present elements of a theory of translation - invariant integration , measure , and harmonic analysis on a valuation field with local field as residue field . </S>",

    "<S> integration over a valuation field is an important problem in certain areas of mathematics and mathematical physics . in the case of a higher dimensional local field </S>",
    "<S> it was first considered by fesenko @xcite @xcite , and later by kim and lee @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a model theoretic approach to the theory of translation invariant integration follows from the works of hrushovski and kazhdan @xcite @xcite in the case of characteristic zero ( and sufficiently large positive characteristic ) residue field .    </S>",
    "<S> in the theory of two - dimensional arithmetic schemes a theory of translation invariant integration , harmonic analysis , and zeta integrals over two dimensional local fields is required in order to generalise the techniques of tate @xcite and iwasawa @xcite in the one - dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> such a theory will have applications to the main open problems in the arithmetic of elliptic curves over global fields .    to study the representation theory of algebraic groups over two - dimensional local fields ( see @xcite for measure theory , @xcite for further references ) and langlands philosophy , such a theory is invaluable .    in mathematical physics , </S>",
    "<S> the feynman integral is not understood rigorously ( see @xcite for discussion of the problems ) . </S>",
    "<S> the valuation fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 may be identified with subspaces of the space of continuous paths , and so measure theory on them may provide insight into feynman measure .    </S>",
    "<S> we now outline the content of the paper and important ideas .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath2 be a valuation field with valuation group @xmath3 and integers @xmath4 , whose residue field @xmath5 is a non - discrete , locally compact field ( ie . </S>",
    "<S> a local field : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or non - archimedean ) . given a haar integrable function @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the lift , denoted @xmath9 , of @xmath10 to @xmath4 by the residue map , as well as the functions of @xmath2 obtained by translating and scaling @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we work with the space spanned by these function as @xmath10 varies . a simple linear independence result ( proposition [ prop_linear_independence_of_lifted_functions ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is key to proving that an integral taking values in @xmath14 ( the complex group algebra of @xmath3 ) , under which @xmath9 has value @xmath15 , is well defined .    </S>",
    "<S> the integration yields a translation invariant measure . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of @xmath0 , the set @xmath16 $ ] is given measure @xmath17 in @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a lebesgue measurable subset of @xmath7 of positive finite measure @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first elements of a theory of harmonic analysis are then presented for fields which are self - dual in a certain sense . </S>",
    "<S> not all functions occuring belong to the space of integrable functions already considered , and so the integral is extended . </S>",
    "<S> a fourier transform is defined and a double transform formula proved .    there </S>",
    "<S> then appears a short section on integrating over the multiplicative group of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> here we generalise the relationship @xmath21 between the multiplicative and additive haar measures of a local field .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is a higher dimensional local field then the main results of the aforementioned sections reduce to results of fesenko in @xcite ( henceforth referred to as [ aoas ] ) and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results here are much more general ( and abstract ) ; in particular , if @xmath5 is archimedean then we provide proofs of claims in @xcite regarding higher dimensional archimedean local fields , and whereas those papers work with complete fields , we require no topological conditions . the more abstract approach to the integral developed in this paper appears to be powerful ; the author has also used it to prove fubini s theorem for certain repeated integrals over @xmath22 and deduce the existence of a translation invariant integral on @xmath23 .    in the final sections of the paper , </S>",
    "<S> we consider various zeta integrals . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , parts of the theory of local zeta integrals over @xmath5 are lifted to @xmath2 . in doing </S>",
    "<S> so we are lead to consider certain divergent integrals related to quantum field theory and we suggest a method of obtaining epsilon constants from such integrals .    </S>",
    "<S> we then consider zeta integrals over the local field @xmath5 ; a modified fourier transform @xmath24 is defined ( following weil @xcite and [ aoas ] in the non - archimedean case ) and we prove , following the approaches of tate and weil , that it leads to a local functional equation , with appropriate epsilon factor , with respect to @xmath25 goes to @xmath26 : @xmath27 after explicitly calculating some @xmath28-transforms we use this functional equation to calculate the @xmath28-epsilon factors for all quasi - characters @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> these results on zeta integrals and epsilon factors are then used to prove that @xmath28 is an endomorphism of @xmath30 , which , though important , appears not to have been considered before . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 is archimedean we define a new @xmath28-transform and consider some examples .    </S>",
    "<S> zeta integrals over the two - dimensional local field are then considered following [ aoas ] . lacking a measure theory on the topological @xmath31-group @xmath32 ( the appropriate object for class field theory of @xmath2 ; </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite ) , a zeta integral over ( a subgroup of ) @xmath33 is considered : @xmath34 analytic continuation and functional equation are established for certain quasi - characters ; indeed in these cases the functional equation , and explicit l - functions and epsilon factors , follow from properties of the @xmath28-transform on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared with [ aoas ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of our new approach to the integration theory are apparent in these chapters on local zeta integrals . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to lift known results up from the local field @xmath5 , rather than try to generalise the proof for a local field to the two - dimensional field . for example , we therefore immediately know that many of our local zeta functions have analytic continuation . </S>",
    "<S> apparently complicated integrals on @xmath2 reduce to familiar integrals over @xmath5 where manipulations are easier ; for example , we may work at the level of @xmath5 even though we are calculating epsilon factors for _ two - dimensional _ zeta integrals .    </S>",
    "<S> the appendices are used to discuss theory which would otherwise interrupt the paper . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the set manipulations in [ aoas ] ( use to prove that the measure is well - defined ) are reproved here more abstractly . </S>",
    "<S> secondly we discuss what we mean by a holomorphic function taking values in a complex vector space ; this allow us to discuss analytic continuation of our zeta functions . </S>",
    "<S> finally the extension of the integration theory to @xmath22 is considered ; no proofs are given and similar results may be found in @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath3 be a totally ordered group and @xmath2 a field with a valuation @xmath35 with residue field @xmath5 , ring of integers @xmath4 and residue map @xmath36 ( also denoted by an overline ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose further that the valuation is split ; that is , there exists a homomorphism @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the valuation induces a homomorphism @xmath39 by @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> assume also that @xmath3 contains a minimal positive element , denoted @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> sets of the form @xmath42 are called _ translated fractional ideals _ ; @xmath43 is referred to as the _ height _ of the set .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 denotes the field of fractions of the complex group algebra @xmath14 of @xmath3 ; the basis element of the group algebra corresponding to @xmath45 shall be written as @xmath46 rather than as @xmath43 . with this notation , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if @xmath3 is a free abelian group of finite rank @xmath48 , then @xmath44 is isomorphic to the rational function field @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> we fix a choice of haar measure on @xmath5 ; occasionally , for convenience , we shall assume that @xmath50 has measure one . the measure on @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> is chosen to satisfy @xmath52 .    the assumptions above hold for a higher dimensional local field . </S>",
    "<S> for basic definitions and properties of such fields , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , suppose that @xmath53 is a higher dimensional local field of dimension @xmath54 : we allow the case in which @xmath55 is an archimedean local field . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath55 is non - archimedean , instead of the usual rank @xmath48 valuation @xmath56 , let @xmath57 be the @xmath58 components of @xmath59 corresponding to the fields @xmath60 ; note that @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath55 is archimedean , then @xmath2 may be similarly viewed as an valuation field with value group @xmath62 and residue field @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> the residue field of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath57 is the local field @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is non - archimedean , then the ring of integers @xmath64 of @xmath2 with respect to the rank @xmath48 valuation is equal to @xmath65 , while the groups of units @xmath66 with respect to the rank @xmath48 valuation is equal to @xmath67 .    </S>",
