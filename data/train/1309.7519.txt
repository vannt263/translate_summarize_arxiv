    "in heavy ion collision experiments , more and more evidences support the fact that the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in au - au collision is strongly coupled rather than weakly coupled as we expected @xcite .",
    "however strong coupling is a real challenge in theory since perturbative field theory fails when the coupling constant is larger than one .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , which shows the relation between string theory on ads spacetime with conformal field theory on boundary of the bulk spacetime , has emerged as an extremely powerful tool for dealing with strong coupling qgp problems .",
    "the simple but still useful example of such duality is the maldacena conjecture @xcite : the weak coupling limit in type iib string theory on @xmath1 space is equivalent to the strong coupling limit in four - dimensional @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills(sym ) theory .",
    "the conjecture makes it possible to understand the field - theory correlation functions in the strong coupling through weakly coupled classical supergravity .",
    "although extracting the lorentzian - signature ads / cft results directly from gravity is indispensable , many useful properties of gauge theories at finite temperature can be obtained from real - time green s functions by the prescription @xcite of minkowski - space correlators in ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the thermal r - current correlators in @xmath2 sym were derived in the small momentum and energy limit ( @xmath3 ) @xcite and numerically calculated at the condition of @xmath4 @xcite , while the correlators in full regime with respect to energy and momentum are still absent .",
    "all kinds of limit can not completely represent the full properties of correlators .",
    "so in this paper we present the thermal correlators numerically for whole range of momentum and energy . as an application , we disscuss the dielectric function .",

    ", action is still lorentz - covariant , so we can get the five dimensional maxwell equation , @xmath20    in order to simplify the calculation we set @xmath21 , then the five dimensional maxwell equation is reduced to the following set of equations :    @xmath22 where @xmath23 are dimensionless energy and momentum respectively , @xmath24 stands for @xmath25 or @xmath26 , the prime on the field components indicate the derivatives of u. fourier transformation has been involved to the bulk field , @xmath27    obviously the four maxwell equations are not independent : from and we can get . combining and , one can obtain the differential equation of @xmath28 , @xmath29    the terms in the action which contain two derivatives with respect to @xmath30 are @xmath31 in the last line , only surface term survives due to the equation of motion .",
    "since the contribution from the horizon needs to be zero @xcite , one can write the action as @xmath32 according to the minkowski space prescription , we obtain @xmath33 we set the boundary conditions as @xmath34 @xmath28 and @xmath35 are coupled , so we have the relation @xmath36 set @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 from , then the expression of @xmath39 is @xmath40 similarly , one obtains other components , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the infinitesimal which is relevant to the uv violation and can be handled by regularization .",
    "in this section , the main task is to solve the equations - . is a fuchs equation to @xmath43 with four poles ( @xmath44 ) . what we need to know is the solution near @xmath16 .",
