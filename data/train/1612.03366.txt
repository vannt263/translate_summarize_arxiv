    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf , 2009 - 2012 , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and its successor , the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf , 2013 - 2016 ) , are dedicated wide - field synoptic sky survey projects with aims of detecting various types of transients in the universe . given the synoptic nature of ptf / iptf surveys , a large number of known or new rr lyrae with homogeneous light curve data is expected to be found in ptf / iptf data . since rr lyrae are population ii standard candles at which they have roughly a constant absolute magnitude in @xmath0 band ( @xmath6 ) , rr lyrae have been used in various distance - scale studies such as tracing the galactic halo structure ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we have initiated a program to investigate the properties of rr lyrae in the ptf / iptf native @xmath1-band photometric system ( hereafter @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath6 for rr lyrae is correlated with metallicity ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the metallicity is mostly measured or expressed in terms of @xmath2 $ ] , then the distance to an rr lyrae can be deduced by knowing its metallicity and hence its @xmath6 value.-@xmath2 $ ] relation to derive distance is still prone to several issues such as reddening to individual stars , the form of the @xmath6-@xmath2 $ ] relation ( linear , quadratic , or two relations for metal - rich and metal - poor rr lyraes ) , and evolutionary effects ( such as empirical diagnostics to quantify the evolution away from the zero age horizontal branch ) .",
    "recent discussions on these issues can be found , for example , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "detailed investigations of these issues , however , are beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in subsequent papers . the current paper , which represents the first paper in a series , only deals with the @xmath2 $ ] part in the @xmath6-@xmath2 $ ] relation . ] the best way to obtain @xmath2 $ ] is via a spectroscopic technique ; however , this can be quite expensive in terms of telescope time .",
    "fortunately , photometric @xmath2 $ ] for rr lyrae can be estimated via the metallicity - light curve relation , at which the light curves for rr lyrae can be fitted with a truncated sine - series of fourier decomposition ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the order of fitting , @xmath3 is pulsation period in days , and @xmath10 is time of observation .",
    "the mean magnitude @xmath11 , amplitude @xmath12 , and phase @xmath13 values at given @xmath14-order can be obtained by fitting the observed light - curve data with equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the light - curve parameters , or fourier parameters , can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 :    @xmath15    the metallicity - light curve relation for fundamental mode @xmath16-type rr lyrae ( hereafter rrab ) was first quantitatively studied in @xcite .",
    "later , such a relation was derived , or fitted , from field rrab in @xcite , and subsequently extended by @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "such a relation is given as @xmath2_v = -5.038 - 5.394p+1.345\\phi_{31}$ ] , where @xmath17 is calculated using equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) based on the @xmath0-band light curves . a preliminary updated version of the @xcite relation is presented in @xcite , which incorporates rr lyrae in globular clusters .",
    "other metallicity - light curve relations based on the @xmath0-band light curves can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "besides the @xmath0-band light curves , @xcite gives the relation based on @xmath18-band light curves .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived a similar relation as in @xcite for unfiltered , or white light , ccd observations , and for the @xmath19-band sdss ( sloan digitized sky survey ) data , respectively .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite further developed the metallicity - light curve relation in the sdss photometric system with additional terms in the relation .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite derived such a relation in the _ kepler _ magnitude ( @xmath20 ) system .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite derived the fourier interrelations to convert the @xmath4 parameters in @xmath18 band to @xmath0 band and then applied the metallicity - light curve relations mentioned .",
    "the validity of such a metallicity - light curve relation has been tested and verified , for example , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "to fully utilize the rr lyrae found in the ptf / iptf data for future distance - scale work , it is necessary to derive the metallicity - light curve relation in the native @xmath7-band photometric system .",
    "even though , in principle , it is possible to apply the transformation equation provided in @xcite to convert the ptf / iptf photometry in the @xmath21-band to the johnson - cousin @xmath0-band and hence to apply the @xcite relation ; in practice , this is difficult to achieve because ( a ) this transformation requires the @xmath22 color curves for the rr lyrae found in ptf / iptf to be available , but we generally do not have such data , and ( b ) the majority of the data taken in ptf / iptf are in the @xmath7-band .",
    "therefore , direct derivation of the metallicity - light curve relation in the native @xmath7-band is desirable . in this work",
    ", we present the derivation of such a relation by using the known rr lyrae located in the _ kepler _ field , because these rr lyrae possess very precise and accurate period determination based on the _ kepler _ light curves and spectroscopic measurements of @xmath2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "a brief description of the ptf / iptf project is presented in section 2 .",
    "the ptf / iptf data for rr lyrae in the _ kepler _ field were mentioned in section 3 , followed by the construction of the light curves in section 4 . based on the ptf / iptf light curves",
    ", we derived the @xmath4 fourier parameters in section 5 .",
    "the @xmath7-band metallicity - light curve relation will be derived and tested in section 6 .",
    "finally , a discussion and our conclusions will be presented in section 7 . throughout the paper ,",
    "the fourier parameter @xmath4 is based on the sine - series as shown in equation ( 1 ) , which can be converted to the cosine - based @xmath4 by subtracting @xmath23 ( that is , @xmath24 ) .",
    "also , as a reminder , throughout the paper , a @xmath25  dex difference at @xmath2=-1.5 $ ]  dex corresponds to roughly a factor of two difference in metal abundance by mass .",
    "the ptf / iptf project mainly utilizes the 48 inch samuel oschin telescope located at the palomar observatory , known as the p48 telescope , to search for transients .",
    "the p48 telescope is equipped with a wide - field mosaic camera consists of eleven @xmath26 ccd @xcite , for the surveys carried out by both ptf and iptf .",
    "the pixel scale of each ccd is @xmath27 arc - second per pixel , hence providing a total field of view ( fov ) of @xmath28-degree@xmath29 for a single ptf / iptf image .",
    "observations with the p48 telescope were mainly done in the mould @xmath1-band filter ( i.e. the @xmath7 filter ) , with occasional observations carried out in the @xmath21 or @xmath30 filters .",
    "the nominal exposure time for ptf / iptf images is 60  s , which can reach to a depth of @xmath31  mag in the @xmath7 band ( with a @xmath32sigma detection ) .",
    "the ptf / iptf imaging data from the p48 telescope was reduced and processed with two different pipelines @xcite .",
    "one of the pipelines , based on the image subtraction technique , is tailored for quick discovery of transients ; while another pipeline , hosted at the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) , will fully reduce the raw images and provide catalogs of all detected objects in the images .",
    "photometric calibration of the detected objects was also included in the ipac pipeline .",
    "further details of the ipac pipeline and the photometric calibration procedure can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and will not be repeated here . since the main goals for ptf and iptf include the detections of transients ( such as supernovae ) in the local universe and pursue for new discoveries with dedicated and well - designed experiments , hence the cadence carried out in ptf and iptf varies from 90  s to a few days .",
    "time - series data from ptf / iptf has not only has been used for the search of transients , but also in the studies of other time - domain phenomena such as variable stars ( for an example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and asteroids ( for an example , see * ? ? ?",

    "this result reiterates the finding in @xcite , who suggested that the photometric metallicity can still be estimated from light curves with insufficient phase coverage when there are data points around the maximum or minimum light .",
    "in other phases around the ascending and descending branch of the light curve , the phase gap with width of 0.1 does not greatly affect the determination of the @xmath4 fourier parameters .",
    "certainly , the @xmath4 fourier parameters would be less accurate when the width of the phase gap increases , and auxiliary techniques such as adding an interpolated data point in the gap ( as employed in this work ) or applying a polynomial fit @xcite are needed to recover the @xmath4 fourier parameters .",
    "we anticipate that the problem of the phase gap presented in light curves will be diminished within the ztf project because a much larger number of data points per light curve will be collected in the era of ztf .",
    "we thank the referee for valuable input that improved the manuscript .",

    "<S> the wide - field synoptic sky surveys , known as the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) and the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ) , will accumulate a large number of known and new rr lyrae . </S>",

    "<S> candidates of halo rr lyrae can be identified from their distance and metallicity before requesting spectroscopic observations for confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> this is because both quantities can be obtained via their photometric light curves , because the absolute @xmath0-band magnitude for rr lyrae is correlated with metallicity , and the metallicity can be estimated using a metallicity - light curve relation . to fully utilize the ptf and iptf light - curve data in related future work , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to derive the metallicity - light curve relation in the native ptf / iptf @xmath1-band photometric system . in this work , we derived such a relation using the known ab - type rr lyrae located in the _ kepler _ field , and it is found to be @xmath2_{ptf }   =   -4.089 - 7.346 p + 1.280 \\phi_{31}$ ] ( where @xmath3 is pulsational period and @xmath4 is one of the fourier parameters describing the shape of the light curve ) , with a dispersion of @xmath5  dex . </S>",
    "<S> we tested our metallicity - light curve relation with new spectroscopic observations of a few rr lyrae in the _ kepler _ field , as well as several data sets available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our tests demonstrated that the derived metallicity - light curve relation could be used to estimate metallicities for the majority of the rr lyrae , which are in agreement with the published values . </S>"
