    "hadron production in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) is usually described in terms of universal parton distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "thanks to the factorisation theorem , hadronic cross sections are obtained by convoluting short - distance partonic cross sections , calculable in pertubation theory , with such distributions .",
    "to lowest order in the strong coupling , this mechanism is expected to describe hadron production in the so called current fragmentation region , _",
    "i.e. _ the phase space region in which the struck parton hadronises . in order to obtain a global description of the particle production spectrum , and in particular of hadron production in the target fragmentation region , the introduction of new non - perturbative distributions is mandatory .",
    "this issue was early realised in ref .",
    "@xcite where the concept of fracture functions was introduced .",
    "the latter parametrise the hadronisation into the final - state hadron of the coloured spectator system which results from the removal of the scattered parton from the initial - state hadron . for this reason ,",
    "their flavour and energy dependecies are expected to be significantly different from fragmentation functions which parametrise the fragmentation of a single parton into the observed hadron .",
    "fracture functions , by construction , simultaneously encode information both on the parton partecipating the hard scattering and on the fragmentation of the spectator system into the observed hadron .",
    "therefore they constitute the connection between forward particle production at small transverse momentum ( _ i.e. _ target fragments ) and high momentum transfer processes ( _ i.e. _ dis ) .",
    "although intrinsically of non - perturbative nature , the scale dependence of such distributions can be predicted by perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "fracture functions obey , in fact , dglap  @xcite inhomogeneous evolution equations which result from the structure of collinear singularities in the target fragmentation region  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a dedicated factorisation theorem  @xcite guarantees that fracture functions are universal distributions , at least in the context of sidis . among baryons ,",
    "lambda hyperons are predominantly produced in the sidis target fragmentation region and show a significant leading particle effect , _",
    "i.e. _ they carry a significant fraction of the incoming proton momentum . for such reasons",
    "they have been used as a case study and a first attempt to determine lambda fracture functions have been recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite by performing a simultaneous qcd fit to a variety of semi - inclusive lambda production data collected in lepton - nucleon scattering . in the present paper , by using this model , we present predictions for lambda observables in the target fragmentation region of neutral current ( nc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) focusing on clas@12 gev kinematics .",
