    "recent accelerator results  @xcite have confirmed the 1962 prediction of askaryan@xcite that electromagnetic cascades in dense media should produce strong coherent pulses of microwave cherenkov radiation .",
    "these confirmations strengthen the motivation to use this effect to search for cascades induced by predicted diffuse backgrounds of high energy neutrinos , which are associated with the presence of @xmath2 ev cosmic rays in many models . at neutrino energies of about 100 eev ( 1 eev = @xmath3 ev ) ,",
    "cascades in the upper 10 m of the radio - transparent lunar regolith result in pulses that are detectable by large radio telescopes at earth  @xcite .",
    "one prior experiment has been reported , using the parkes 64 m telescope  @xcite with about 10 hours of livetime .    at frequencies above 2 ghz , ionospheric delay smearing is unimportant , and the signal should appear as highly linearly - polarized , band - limited electromagnetic impulses  @xcite .",
    "however , since there are many anthropogenic sources of impulsive radio emission , the primary problem in detecting such pulses is eliminating sensitivity to such interference .    since 1999",
    "we have been conducting a series of experiments to establish techniques to measure such pulses , using the jpl / nasa deep space network antennas at goldstone tracking facility near barstow , california  @xcite .",
    "we employ the 70 m and 34 m telecommunication antennas ( designated dss14 and dss13 respectively ) in a coincidence - type system to solve the problem of terrestrial interference , and this approach has proven very effective . since mid-2000 , the project has moved into a new status as an ongoing experiment , and receives more regularly scheduled observations , subject to the constraints imposed by the spacecraft telecommunications priorities of the goldstone facility .",
    "although the total livetime accumulated in such an experiment is a relatively small fraction of what is possible with a dedicated system , the volume of material to which we are sensitive , a significant fraction of the moon s surface to @xmath4 m depth , is enormous , exceeding 100,000 km@xmath5 at the highest energies .",
    "the resulting sensitivity is enough to begin to constrain some models for diffuse neutrino backgrounds at energies near and beyond @xmath6 ev .",
    "we report on the status of the experiment , and astrophysical constraints imposed by limits from about 30 hours of livetime .",
    "we are also improving our understanding of the emission geometry and detection sensitivity through simulations , and describe initial results in extending our sensitivity to pulses of lower amplitude .",
    "the lunar regolith is an aggregate layer of fine particles and small rocks , thought to be the accumulated ejecta of meteor impacts with the lunar surface .",
    "it consists mostly of silicates and related minerals , with meteoritic iron and titanium compounds at an average level of several per cent , and traces of meteoritic carbon .",
    "it has a typical depth range of 10 to 20 m in the maria and valleys , but may be hundreds of meters deep in portions of the highlands  @xcite .",
    "it has a mean dielectric constant of @xmath7 and a density of @xmath8 gm @xmath9 , both increasing slowly with depth .",
    "measured values for the loss tangent vary widely depending on iron and titanium content , but a mean value at high frequencies is @xmath10 , implying a field attenuation length at 2 ghz of @xmath11  m  @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ moongeom ] we illustrate the signal emission geometry . at 100 eev the interaction length @xmath12 of an electron or muon neutrino for the dominant deep inelastic hadronic scattering interactions ( averaging over the charged and neutral current processes ) is about 60  km  @xcite ( @xmath13 km ) . upon interaction ,",
    "a @xmath4 m long cascade then forms as the secondary particles multiply , and compton scattering , positron annihilation , and other scattering processes then lead to a @xmath14 negative charge excess which radiates a cone of coherent cherenkov emission at an angle of @xmath15 , with a fwhm of @xmath16 .",
    "the radiation propagates in the form of a sub - ns pulse through the regolith to the surface where it is refracted upon transmission .    because the angle for total internal reflection ( tir ) of the radiation emitted from the cascade is to first order the complement of the cherenkov angle",
    ", we consider for the moment only neutrinos that cascade upon emerging from a penetrating chord through the lunar limb . under these conditions",
    "the typical neutrino cascade has an upcoming angle with respect to the local surface of @xmath17 which implies a mean of @xmath18 at @xmath6 ev .    at the regolith surface",
    "the resulting microwave cherenkov radiation is refracted strongly into the forward direction . scattering from surface irregularities and demagnification from the interface refraction gradient fills in the cherenkov cone , and results in a larger effective area of the lunar surface over",
    "which events can be detected , as well as a greater acceptance solid angle .",
    "these effects are discussed in more detail in section iii.a .",
    "the antennas employed in our search are the shaped - cassegrainian 70 m antenna dss14 , and the beam waveguide 34 m antenna dss13 , both part of the nasa goldstone deep space network ( dsn ) tracking station .",
    "dss13 is located about 22  km to the sse of dss14 .",
    "the s - band ( 2.2  ghz ) right - circular - polarization ( rcp ) signal from dss13 is filtered to 150  mhz bw , then downconverted with an intermediate frequency ( if ) near 300  mhz .",
    "the band is then further subdivided into high and low frequency halves of 75 mhz each , and no overlap .",
    "these if signals are then sent via an analog fiber - optic link to dss14 . at dss14",
    ", the dual polarization s - band signals are downconverted with the same 300  mhz if , and bandwidths of @xmath19 mhz ( rcp ) and 40 mhz ( lcp ) are used .",
    "a third signal is also employed at dss14 : a 1.8 ghz ( l - band ) feed which is off - pointed by @xmath20 is used as a monitor of terrestrial interference signals ; the signal is downconverted in the same manner as the other signals and has a 40 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the experimental approach in our initial 12 hours of observations was to use a single antenna trigger with dual antenna data recording  @xcite .",
    "this was accomplished by using the local s - band signals as dss14 to form a 2-fold coincidence with an active veto from the l - band interference monitor .",
    "since any system with an active veto is subject to potential unforeseen impact on the trigger efficiency , we have now developed an approach which utilizes signals from both antennas to form a real - time dual - antenna trigger , with no active veto .",
    "[ trigger1 ] shows the layout of the trigger .",
    "the four triggering signals from the two antennas are converted to unipolar pulses using tunnel - diode square - law detectors .",
    "stanford research systems sr400 discriminators are used for the initial threshold level , and these are set to maintain a roughly constant singles rate , typically 0.5 - 1 khz / chan for dss14 and 30 khz / chan for dss13 ( dss13 s rate is higher due to a lower threshold , compensating for the reduced aperture size ) . a local coincidence",
    "is then formed for each antenna s signals .",
    "the dss14 coincidence between both circular polarizations ensures that the signals are highly linearly polarized , and the dss13 coincidence helps to ensure that the signal is broadband .",
    "[ trigger2 ] indicates the timing sequence for a trigger to form ( negative logic levels are used here ) .",
    "a local coincidence at dss14 , typically with a 25  ns gate , initiates the trigger sequence .",
    "after a 65  @xmath21s delay , a 150  @xmath21s gate is opened ( the delays compensate for the 136  @xmath21s fiber delay between the two antennas ) .",
    "this large time window encompasses the possible geometric delay range for the moon throughout the year .",
    "use of a smaller window is possible but would require delay tracking and a thus more stringent need for testing and reliability ; use of a large window avoids this and a tighter coincidence can then be required offline .    if a 25  ns local coincidence now forms between the two dss13 signals within the allowed 150  @xmath21s window , a trigger is formed .",
    "the sampling scopes are then triggered , and a 250  @xmath21s record , sampled at 1 gs / s , is stored .",
    "the average trigger rate , due primarily to random coincidences of thermal noise fluctuations , is about 1.6 mhz , or 1 trigger every 5 minutes or so .",
    "terrestrial interference triggers are uncommon ( a few percent of the total ) , but can occasionally increase in number when a large burst of interference occurs at either antenna , with dss14 more sensitive to this effect .",
    "the deadtime per event is about 6  s ; thus on average we maintain about 99% livetime during a run .",
    "estimates of the sensitivity of radio telescope observations usually involve systems that integrate total power for some time constant @xmath22 which is in general much longer than the antenna s single temporal mode duration which is given by the inverse of the bandwidth : @xmath23 .",
    "since the pulses of interest in our experiment are much shorter than this time scale , the observed pulse structure of induced voltage in the antenna receiver is determined only by the bandpass function ; that is , the pulses are band - limited . thus the typical dependence of sensitivity on the factor",
    "@xmath24 does not obtain ; this factor is always unity in band - limited pulse detection .    because much of the theoretical work in describing such pulses has been done in terms of field strength rather than power",
    ", we analyze our sensitivity in these terms as well .",
    "such analysis is also compatible with the receiving system , which records antenna voltages proportional to the incident electric field , and leads to a more linear analysis .",
    "it also yields signal - to - noise ratio estimates which are consistent with gaussian statistics , since thermal noise voltages are described by a gaussian random process .",
    "the expected field strength per unit bandwidth from a cascade of total energy @xmath25 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance to the source in m , @xmath28 is the radio frequency , and the decoherence frequency is @xmath29 mhz for regolith material ( @xmath30 scales mainly by radiation length ) . for typical parameters in our experiment , a @xmath31 ev cascade will result in a peak field strength at earth of @xmath32v m@xmath33 for a 70 mhz bw .",
    "equation  [ zhs ] has now been verified to within factors of @xmath34 through accelerator tests  @xcite using silica sand targets and @xmath35-ray - bunch - induced cascades with @xmath36 ev per bunch .",
    "given that the use of a dual antenna trigger has virtually eliminated the problem of terrestrial interference that was the primary limitation to the sensitivity of the one previous experiment  @xcite , we can now express the minimum detectable field strength @xmath37 for each antenna in terms of the induced signal and the thermal noise background .",
    "the expected signal strength @xmath38 induces a voltage at the antenna receiver given by @xmath39 where the antenna effective height @xmath40 is given by  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the antenna radiation resistance , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the antenna efficiency and area , respectively , @xmath45 is the impedance of free space , and @xmath46 the polarization angle of the antenna with respect to the plane of polarization of the radiation .",
    "the average thermal noise voltage in the system is given by @xmath47 here @xmath48 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath49 is the system thermal noise temperature , and @xmath50 the termination impedance of the receiver .",
    "if we assume that @xmath51 then the resulting snr @xmath52 is @xmath53 the minimum detectable field strength ( @xmath54 ) is then given by @xmath55 combining this with equation  [ zhs ] above , the threshold energy for pulse detection is @xmath56 ~.\\ ] ]    for the lunar observations on the limb , which make up about 85% of the data reported here , @xmath57 k , @xmath58 ghz , and the average @xmath59 mhz . for the 70 m antenna , with efficiency @xmath60 ,",
    "the minimum detectable field strength is @xmath61 v m@xmath33 mhz@xmath33 for @xmath62 .",
    "the estimated threshold energy for these parameters is @xmath63 ev , assuming a detection level of @xmath64 per if at dss14 ( with a somewhat lower requirement at dss13 in coincidence ) .      to estimate the effective volume and acceptance solid angle as a function of incoming neutrino energy ,",
    "events were generated at discrete neutrino energies , including the current best estimates of both charged and neutral current cross sections  @xcite , and the bjorken - y distribution .",
    "both electron and muon neutrino interactions were included , and landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effects in the shower formation were estimated  @xcite . at each neutrino energy , a distribution of cascade angles and depths with respect to the local surface was obtained , and a refraction propagation of the predicted cherenkov angular distribution was made through the regolith surface , including absorption and reflection losses and a first order roughness model .",
    "antenna thermal noise fluctuations were included in the detection process .",
    "a portion of the simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ crpattern ] . here",
    "the flux density is shown as it would appear projected on the sky , with ( 0,0 ) corresponding to the tangent to the lunar surface in the direction of the original cascade .",
    "the units are jy ( 1 jy = @xmath65 w m@xmath66 hz@xmath33 ) as measured at earth , and the plot is an average over several hundred events at different depths and a range of @xmath67 consistent with a @xmath6 ev neutrino interaction , averaging over inelasticity effects and a mixture of electron and muon neutrinos consistent with decays from a hadronic @xmath68 source .",
    "although the averaging has broadened the distribution somewhat , a typical cascade still produces a flux density pattern of comparable angular size .",
    "the angular width of the pattern directly increases the acceptance solid angle , and the angular height increases the annular band of the lunar surface over which neutrino events can be detected , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ moongeom ] .",
    "the net effect is that , although the specific flux density of the events are lowered somewhat by refraction and scattering , the effective volume and acceptance solid angle are significantly increased .",
    "the neutrino acceptance solid angle , in particular , is about a factor of 50 larger than the apparent solid angle of the moon itself .",
    "we have noted above that the refraction geometry of the regolith favors emission from cascades that are upcoming relative to the local regolith surface .",
    "thus to first order ehe cosmic ray events , which cascade within a few tens of cm as they enter the regolith , will not produce detectable pulses since their emission with be totally internally reflected within the regolith .",
    "this effect has been now demonstrated in an accelerator experiment  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion does not account for several effects however .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ehecr ] . in fig .",
    "[ ehecr]a , the varying surface angles due surface roughness on scales greater than a wavelength will lead to escape of some radiation from cosmic ray cascades .",
    "[ ehecr]b illustrates that , because the cherenkov angular distribution is not infinitely narrow arround the cherenkov angle ( fwhm @xmath69 ) , emission at angles larger then the cherenkov angle can escape total internal reflectance . in fig .",
    "[ ehecr]c cascades from cosmic rays that enter along ridgelines can encounter a change in slope of the local surface that results in more efficient transmission of the radiation .",
    "even if total internal reflection strongly suppresses detection of cosmic rays in cases a and b , the latter case c of favorable surface geometry along ridgelines or hilltops will lead to some background of ehe cosmic ray events . we have not as yet made estimates of this background .",
    "[ ehecr]d shows the formation zone aspect of the process of cherenkov emission from near - surface cosmic ray cascades .",
    "this constraint may suppress cherenkov production even if surface roughness and the width of the cherenkov distribution would otherwise favor some escape of emission .",
    "it has now been conclusively shown  @xcite that coherent cherenkov emission is a process involving the bulk dielectric properties of the radiating material .",
    "cherenkov radiation is induced over a macroscopic region of the dielectric ( with respect to the scale of a wavelength ) , and does not even require that the charged particles enter the dielectric for radiation to be produced ",
    "a proximity of several wavelengths or less is sufficient  @xcite .",
    "a corollary to this result is that a cascade travelling along very near a boundary of the dielectric will not radiate ( or radiate only weakly ) into the hemisphere with the boundary .",
    "thus in the case of a cosmic ray entering the regolith at near grazing incidence ( say within @xmath69 ) the resulting cascade reaches maximum within @xmath70 cm of the surface , still less than a wavelength for s - band observations .",
    "we therefore expect that the suppression of cherenkov emission in such events significantly reduces our sensitivity to cosmic rays .",
    "such effects have not been included yet in other estimates  @xcite of the cosmic ray detection efficieny of such experiments .",
    "figure  [ limits ] plots the predicted fluxes of ehe neutrinos from a number of models including agn production  @xcite gamma - ray bursts  @xcite , ehe cosmic - ray interactions  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , and the @xmath71 burst scenario  @xcite . also plotted",
    "are limits from about 70 days of fly s eye livetime  @xcite ( accumulated in several years of runtime ) , which apply only to electron neutrino events .",
    "our initial 90% cl limit , for 30 hours of livetime is shown plotted with diamonds ( see also table 1 ) , based on the observation of no events above an equivalent @xmath72 level amplitude ( referenced to the 70 m antenna ) consistent with the direction of the moon .",
    "these limits assume a monoenergetic signal at each energy ; thus they are differential limits and independent of source spectral model , and represent the most conservative limits we can apply .",
    "our limits just begin to constrain the highest topological defect model  @xcite for which we expected a total of order 12 events .",
