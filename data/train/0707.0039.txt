    "one of the main scientific objectives of akari ( murakami et al . 2007 ) is to investigate the history of galaxy evolution by measuring thermal emissions from interstellar dust heated by the uv light from stars .",
    "far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) onboard akari with four photometric bands of 65 , 90 , 140 and 160 @xmath1 ( kawada et al . 2007 ) is designed to detect such dusty objects at wavelengths near the peak of the dust emission .",
    "mapping observations with akari in the slow scan mode provide 12 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than that in the all sky survey mode with fast scan , and they are suitable for probing distant luminous infrared galaxies .    the iras mission has discovered the presence of luminous infrared galaxies in local universe ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 ) , and their number counts show an excess over the predicted counts for the non - evolution scenario ( hacking & soifer 1991 ) .",
    "far - infrared deep surveys with infrared space observatory ( iso ) have confirmed the findings by iras at much deeper flux levels ; faint galaxy counts at 90 and 170 @xmath1 show steep increase of the excess counts as flux levels become fainter ( kawara et al .",

    "these iso results have inspired us with insight for the link between local luminous infrared galaxies and galaxy formation in early epoch , and they have provided useful constraints on the galaxy evolution models . the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al . 2004 ) with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) ( rieke et al . 2004 ) provided the number counts at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath1 down to 12 orders of magnitude deeper fluxes than previously reached and strongly constrained the galaxy evolution models ( papovich et al .",
    "2004 , dole et al .",
    "2004 , frayer et al .",
    "the spitzer results in all mips bands are well fitted with phenomenological models that predict most of the faint galaxies lie at redshifts between 0.7 and 0.9 ( dole et al .",
    "2003 , lagache et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "their models reproduce a broad shape of the measured redshift distribution for the spitzer 24 @xmath1 samples , but the models still show discrepancies in some details at high redshifts @xmath3 ( perez - gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 , le floch et al . 2005 , caputi et al .",
    "they suggest that some details of the discrepancies in the redshift distribution between observations and models may come from the field variance .",
    "therefore , further study of galaxy modeling with large amount of galaxy samples is still required .",
    "akari will provide us important constraints because of its high statistics on precedented sensitivity levels over the whole sky .",
    "this first deep survey validates the akari great capabilities , and furthermore bring new constraints especially at 90 @xmath1 , where iras and iso data at faint flux levels below 100 mjy are not accurate enough to provide tight constraints on the evolutionary models .",
    "recent advances in observational study in wide wavelength range from optical to millimeter - wave have shown that luminous infrared galaxies are minority in local universe but major building blocks of the high redshift universe in terms of the total radiation energy release ( blain et al .",
    "unresolved faint galaxies at high redshifts would form the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) .",
    "in fact , cib in the far - infrared regime measured with cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) accounts about half of the total energy of optical / infrared background ( puget et al .",
    "1996 , hauser et al .",
    "1998 , lagache et al .",
    "1999 , hauser & dwek 2001 , finkbeiner et al .",
    "that tells us the importance of exploration of far - infrared sources which are responsible for the energy release in the cosmic history .",
    "recent spitzer results of ultra - deep galaxy counts at 70 @xmath1 ( frayer et al .",
    "2006b ) and of the stacking analysis for faint sources at 70 and 160 @xmath1 accompanied with the 24 @xmath1 sources ( dole et al . 2006 ) show that more than @xmath470% of cib has been resolved into point sources .",
    "however , previous galaxy counts at the peak of the measured cib ( @xmath4100 @xmath1 ) in between the mips bands have not reached to such deep levels .    in this work",
    ", we performed far - infrared deep surveys with akari in the lockman hole , in order to measure the source counts at previously unexplored sensitivity near the photometric bands covering the peak wavelength of cib .",
    "this survey has been done in the performance verification ( pv ) phase of akari mission to demonstrate and evaluate performance of the slow scan observation .",
    "the survey area was , therefore , limited to 0.7 @xmath5 , and east patch of the lockman hole ( lhex field ) , where many observations including follow - up observations from the ground for the iso survey ( oyabu et al .",
    "2005 , rodighiero et al .",
    "2005 ) have been done , was selected for the observation field so that the cross calibration between missions could be done . in this paper , we present the initial results of the number counts for the sources detected with akari .",
    "the observations of the lockman hole were carried out in the pv phase in 2006 may , to check the performance of the fis instrument for observing faint objects and to demonstrate the slow - scan observations for wide - area mapping .",
    "the survey covers a 0.6 deg  @xmath0  1.2 deg ( 0.7 @xmath5 ) region centered at ra(j2000 ) @xmath6 and dec(j2000 ) @xmath6 + , the east side of the lowest cirrus region corresponding to the iso deep survey .",
    "the data were taken using the fis-02 slow - scan observational mode of the astronomical observation template ( aot ) with 15-arcsec / s scan rate and 2-s period reset ( kawada et al .",
    "the fis-02 observation provides a map data with double sightings of each source in a 0.13-deg wide , 1.25-deg long strip area by a single turn - around scan .",
    "the mapping observation was carried out with 11 contiguous scans ; 12 scans were actually done but one scan data were lost with trouble of the ground station . to secure sufficient redundancy and to improve the sensitivity , one third of the width of each single scan strip was ovelapped with the next strip for producing mosaic image .",
    "it took 2 hours of telescope time in total to cover the entire survey field .",
    "the data in the four photometric bands , centered at 65 @xmath1 , 90 @xmath1 , 140 @xmath1 and 160 @xmath1 , were simultaneously taken , and the same field was surveyed in all the bands except for a small margin of the survey area corresponding to the sight difference between field - of - view ( fov ) of each band .",
    "aot includes the calibration sequence for each observation as follows .",
    "the dark measurements by closing the cold shutter and responsivity check with an internal calibrator are carried out during maneuver to change the satellite attitude from the all - sky survey mode to the source targeting mode .",
    "after the maneuver the shutter is opened , the sky signal is monitored during a settling time for fine control of the satellite attitude , and then the slow - scan observation starts . at turning point of the round - trip scan , the shutter is shortly closed , and responsivity check with the internal calibrator is done .",
    "the total exposure time for the round - trip scan is 10 min .",
    "the same calibration sequence as above is repeated during the maneuver for returning to the all - sky survey mode .",
    "in addition to the calibration sequence by continuous light illumination , stimulator flashes every 1 min to check the responsivity drift is operated as is done in the all - sky survey mode .",
    "such highly redundant calibration data set enabled us to correct the responsivity change refering the astronomical calibration data taken by separate observations with the same calibration sequence .",
    "the raw data were initially reduced using a part of the fis all - sky survey pipeline tool for the adu to volt conversion , flagging of bad data ( cosmic - ray events and other discontinuities ) and the correction of non - linear integration ramps .",
    "the reduced data were processed with an official data analysis tool specified for the fis slow - scan observation ( ss - tool ) to produce the basic calibrated data products and the final co - added map .    initial process of ss - tool is the slope calculation of the ramps removing the cosmic - ray events identified in each ramp and correcting the after effect of the calibration lamp ( stimuator ) flashes .",
    "the reset interval of the integration ramp for the lockman hole observations is set to be 2 seconds .",
    "the 2-s ramps are comprised of 52 and 35 samples per pixel for 65/90 @xmath1 and 140/160 @xmath1 detectors , respectively .",
    "the slope calculation processing reduces the sampling rate to one data per ramp per array pixel to maximize signal - to - noise and to avoid a periodic structure arising from incompleteness of the non - linear ramp correction . for 15-arcsec / s scan ,",
    "the reduced data provides only one data sample per pixel for a source crossing time , but the nyquist sampling condition is resultantly satisfied in real space domain after co - addition of the data using all array pixels .",
    "glitches and subsequent tails induced by cosmic - ray hits affect the data severely because of slow transient behavior of the ge : ga detectors .",
    "the integration ramps affected by the glitches were flagged out , and the tails with a 20 s or a longer time constant were suppressed by median filtering in the background subtraction processing as described later .",
    "the tail with a short time constant is not filtered out in this stage , but the affected data are removed by the sigma clipping in the co - addition process .",
    "the stimlator flashes also causes after effects similar to the tails by cosmic - ray hits , but they were repeatable in amplitude and successfully corrected using a template of their average time profile with an accuracy limited by the random noise .",
    "the second step of the ss - tool processing is to produce basic calibrated data for each array pixel , i.e. , the flat fielding .",
    "this process is based on the observations of known diffuse sources ; zodiacal emissions and interstellar dust emissions , which are expected to be smooth within the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the diffuse - source observations were used only for the flat fielding , and the absolute flux calibration for point - sources was separately done ( see section 4 ) , because it might be different from that for diffuse - source due to complex aperture effects .",
    "zodiacal emissions are expected to be an almost perfect flat source ; their anisotropy in arcmin scales are smaller than 1% ( abraham et al . 1998 ) . at 65 and 90",
    "@xmath1 , the sky brightness of the lockman hole is dominated by the zodiacal emissions , and the contributions of galactic cirrus ( interstellar dust ) emissions , bright point sources and cib are expected to be negligible .",
    "hence , observed sky itself could be used for the flat fielding .",
    "the responsivity distribution of the detector arrays is derived from the average of time series data during the slow scan , where the average was calculated after removing the data that exceeds the 3-sigma noise level for each pixel .",
    "the flat was built from the data during the first half of the single turn - around scan of each pointed observation , because the latter part of the data was affected by the stray light as described in the following section .",
    "the flat fielding is done by dividing the data by the responsivity distribution . with this `` self ''",
    "flat fielding method , any stripes in the image caused by the flat field error were buried under the random noise .    at 140 and 160 @xmath1 ,",
    "detector signals are dominated by offset light with a constant intensity from the internal light source .",
    "the offset light is implemented to improve response speed of the stressed ge : ga detector specified for fast scan of the all sky survey mode ( more than 10 times faster than the slow scan used for the lockman hole survey ) .",
    "although galactic cirrus emissions at high latitudes could be a flat source with moderate smoothness ( @xmath410% ) and relatively high brightness , their signals are less than 10% of that of the offset light .",
    "intensity distribution of the offset light at the aperture of detector arrays is estimated from the laboratory measurements to be uniform within 10% .",
    "sky brightness towards the lockman hole at 140 and 160 @xmath1 is less than @xmath42% of the offset light , and its fluctuation is also negligible .",
    "hence , the self flat fielding method with the average sky signal including the offset light was applied to correct the responsivity variation in the detector arrays , as was done for the 65 and 90 @xmath1 bands .      in order to emboss faint point - sources on the co - added map , subtraction of the sky background is required unless its brightness is constant in the field . unexpectedly , there exists a stray light of earth limb emission onto the focal plane under a condition of small earth avoidance angles of the telescope , which varies with attitude and orbit of the satellite .",
    "the stray light shows not only a long - term variation depending on seasonal change of the orbital inclination but also short - term variation during a single observation due to change of the earth avoidance angle at every moment .",
    "brightness of the stray light has the maximum ( 23 mjy / sr at 90 @xmath1 ) at the beginning and the end of the slow scan , and the minimum and plateau region appear around the mid time .    to subtract such slowly varying components as the stray light , we applied the median filtering to the data in time domain with a window size of 20 data samples corresponding to 10 arcmin ( @xmath415 times fwhm ) .",
    "then , the smoothed component was subtracted from the data . as a result of this filtering , extended structure larger than roughly a half of the window size disappears from the map .",
    "the final step of the ss - tool processing is the co - addition of the calibrated time series data onto a sky grid .",
    "the sky position of each data point was derived from the telescope boresight according to the satellite attitude and from the array pixel map on the focal plane .",
    "the grid pixel sizes for all the wave bands were set to 30 arcseconds to secure redundancy , i.e. , sufficient number of data per pixel ( @xmath75 on the average ) . in the co - adding process",
    ", small glitches and other artifacts were sigma - clipped with the standard deviation calculated at each grid pixel .",
    "threshold for the sigma - clipping was set to 1.5 times standard deviation .",
    "percentage of the rejected data in this process was about 3% of the original data .",
    "co - addition of the data that were taken in different scans requires accurate sky position of each array pixel .",
    "the telescope boresight has been calibrated with the slow - scan observations of stars and asteroids , and the resultant position accuracy is approximately 10 arcseconds in absolute measure .",
    "the array pixel map is based on the optical simulation and its in - flight confirmation with point - source observations .",
    "the image distortion has not been fully measured in the entire fov , but the in - flight measurements at limited positions have been carried out with observations of point sources including a bright source in the field . as a result of the measurements ,",
    "the simulation has been verified with an accuracy of 10 arcseconds , which is limited by the absolute position accuracy .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we show the final co - added maps of the lockman hole field at all wavelengths in equatorial coordinates with a pixel size of 30 arcseconds .",
    "the image after gaussian smoothing with a window size of 1 arcminute is shown as linear contours in the unit of surface brightness .",
    "the pixel noise of each map was computed and summarized in the last column of table [ tab : table1 ] in surface brightness . at 65 , 140 and 160",
    "@xmath1 , the pixel noises are dominated by instrumental noise . at 90 @xmath1",
    ", the pixel noise is contributed by the source noise , which can be recognized as a positive tail exceeding the standard deviation in the histogram of pixel distribution .",
    "the noise difference between the 65 and 90 @xmath1 data arises from differences in optical efficiency and filter bandwidth , while the detectors for these two bands are identical .",
    "the noise values for the 140 and 160 @xmath1 bands are different for the same reason .",
    "consequently , the 90 @xmath1 band is the most sensitive in all the photometric bands .",
    "to extract point sources from the final co - added image , we used photometry tools , find , gcntrd and aper , in the idl astronomy user s library at nasa / gsfc ( landsman 1993 ) .",
    "the tools search center positions of point sources with a gaussian window function approximating the point spread function ( psf ) and measure the fluxes by aperture photometry .",
    "psf in each wavelength band is derived from many observations in the pv phase and for calibration .",
    "the aperture radius was set to the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of psf .",
    "the aperture photometry was carried out without the sky subtraction , which was already done in the median filtering process .",
    "this sky subtraction method is helpful to avoid losing sources near a defect pixel caused by some artifacts .",
    "photometric calibration used in this paper is based on point - source observations in the pv phase in various fields , because of lack of well - calibrated source in the lockman hole . according to the measured psf",
    ", the photometric signals were compared with the expected fluxes of the calibration sources converted to the flat spectra , @xmath8 constant , and their linear correlation factors were derived .",
    "the expected fluxes of the calibration sources range from 2 jy to 200 jy at 90 @xmath1 , and deviation from the linear relation had no flux dependence in such a wide flux range .",
    "the calibration accuracy estimated from the standard deviation for various measurements was 17% , 16% , 12% and 22% at 65 , 90 , 140 and 160 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the point - source noise in flux unit , i.e. the 1-sigma detection limit for point source , is derived from the pixel noise in surface brightness and the aperture correction factor , as summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] .      as the flux calibration for akari refers to the flat spectrum",
    ", the real flux is obtained by the color correction depending on spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source .",
    "however , it is difficult to measure the infrared color for all the detected sources especially at faint flux levels , because most of the sources were detected at 90 @xmath1 only .",
    "hence , for producing the source counts we assume that sed of all sources have the flat spectrum , and we estimate the uncertainties of fluxes for various seds .",
    "the color correction was available only for bright sources detected in multiple wavelength bands of akari . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , color - corrected ( open symbols ) and uncorrected ( filled symbols ) spectra of three bright sources in the lockman hole are shown .",
    "the data are compared with modified graybody spectra with different color temperatures ; combinations of a graybody spectrum with an emissivity @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and natural extension from the graybody towards shorter wavelengths by a power - law spectrum with an index @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ( e.g. , blain et al .",

    "the color correction for the 65 @xmath1 data is 29% , which is an extreme case in the parameter range of color temperature .",
    "if the assumed color for id104 is correct , the real 65 @xmath1 flux is expected to be below the detection limit , but the observed flux shows a finite value at 65 @xmath1 . the high flux at 65 @xmath1 may be due to noise - induced flux boosting , which is similar to eddington bias or malmquist bias and usually seen for sources near the detection limit ( heraudeau et al . 2004 ) .    frayer et al .",
    "( 2006a ) reported that the spitzer sources detected at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath1 in the xfls field have a typical dust temperature of 30 k with an emissivity of @xmath151.5 and a power - law index of @xmath162.4 .",

    "the main reason that our 65 @xmath1 counts are slightly higher than the spitzer counts is the field variance ; most of the 65 @xmath1 sources lie in the lower dec field where more bright sources exist , as described in section 5.1 .",
    "note that our 140 @xmath1 counts are also consistently higher than the spitzer 160 @xmath1 counts .",

    "the luminosity function is represented by these two activity types .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted to fit the number counts in multi - wavelength bands from mid - infrared to sub - mm , the redshift distributions , the local luminosity functions at 60 and 850 @xmath1 , and cib .",
    "the contemporary galaxy evolution model of pearson ( 2007 ) uses a backward evolution process based on the iras all - sky pscz multi - component luminosity function defined at 60 @xmath1 comprising of cool normal quiescent galaxies , and a warmer component defined by infrared luminosity as @xmath26 starburst galaxies , @xmath27 lirg sources , @xmath28 ulirg sources and agn .",
    "both luminosity evolution and density evolution is included in the models .",
    "this model fits the observed source counts from the 21200@xmath1 from the iras , iso , spitzer missions and the scuba / jcmt , mambo / iram instruments .",
    "differences between these models are small at brighter fluxes , but at flux levels below 100 mjy strong evolution effects set in and significant differences between models appear .",
    "a significant result of the model comparison is that the observed counts at 90 @xmath1 in a flux range of 26160 mjy are apparently lower than the predicted counts using a model by lagache et al .",

    "separation between models and data starts already at @xmath480 mjy , where the signal - to - noise is high ( @xmath29 ) enough not to lose many sources .",
    "if the discrepancy is due to the flux calibration , our flux calibration has to be different by a factor of @xmath42 , which is unreasonably larger than our estimate of the calibration error . in order to explain our results",

    "it should be emphasized that our results provide strong constraints on the evolutionary scenarios .",

    "our 90 @xmath1 counts were several times lower than the predicted counts by recent evolutionary models that show good agreement with the spitzer / mips data . on the contrary , the observed counts at 65 and 140 @xmath1 are consistent with previous measurements with spitzer at 70 and 160 @xmath1 .",
    "our 90 @xmath1 counts above 26 mjy accounts for @xmath46% of the cib , and the bulk galaxies of the cib may cause a steep rise of the counts below the detection limit .",
    "these results provide strong constraints on the evolutionary models .",
    "the source counts presented in this paper were not color - corrected , because limited samples were available to examime the infrared colors of galaxies .",
    "further study of the source counts could be done by proper color correction based on the measured sed of each source . a far - infrared deep survey in the lowest cirrus region with an area of @xmath410 square degrees near the south ecliptic pole , as a part of akari deep survey programs ( matsuhara et al .",
    "2006 ) , is expected to provide us a large number of samples over 1000 sources down to @xmath420 mjy at 90 @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the akari all - sky survey will provide us extremely high statistics of galaxy samples on precedented sensitivity levels over the whole sky .",
    "the data sets obtained by such large - area surveys are promising not only for producing the sed templates for various galaxy populations but also for extending the flux range of the source counts to much brighter levels than we obtained in this work .",
    "the akari mission is operated by japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) , nagoya university , the university of tokyo and national astronomical observatory japan , european space agency ( esa ) , imperial college london , university of sussex , open university ( uk ) , university of groningen / sron ( netherlands ) , and seoul national university ( korea ) .",

    "a large difference between kawara et al.s count data and ours may arise from the fact that their absolute calibration relies on a single reference , iras f10507 + 5723 , whose flux in the iras faint source catalog ( fsc ) at 100 @xmath1 ( 1.22 jy ) is perhaps overestimated .",
    "in fact , the flux of this source measured with akari is 0.56@xmath320.10 jy at 90 @xmath1 and lower than the iras flux by a factor of @xmath42 .",

    "our recent result of the flux comparison between the akari all - sky survey data and the iras point source catalog ( psc ) shows large scattering of the akari / iras flux ratio up to @xmath45 even for bright sources at fluxes greater than 10 jy in the iras psc ( jeong et al .",
    "this result suggests the diffuculty of flux calibration with small number of samples of iras sources .    a large deviation from the linear relation between the measured flux in rodighiero et al .",
