    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) ising spin glass ( isg ) model has been intensively studied for almost forty years . introduced @xcite as a starting point for studying edwards - anderson - like @xcite spin glasses , it is a classical mean - field @xmath5-spin ising model in which there are quenched random interactions between all pairs of spins .",
    "it has an ordered spin glass phase below the critical temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the static properties such as the specific heat , the magnetic susceptibility and the spin glass order parameter are known to high precision in the ordered state and are well understood in terms of the parisi replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) theory @xcite and its subsequent developments .",
    "the paramagnetic regime has been considered `` trivial '' in that there are simple exact expressions for the basic static physical properties in the large @xmath5 limit .    in the ordered state",

    "for the three temperatures above @xmath0 at which measurements were made the large size limit behavior [ @xmath11 independent of @xmath5 ] is reached with the largest samples studied .    for @xmath14 values down to at least @xmath15 the autocorrelation function decay is strongly non - exponential .",

    "before discussing the sk data analysis it is instructive as an illustration to recall the ( non - equilibrium ) relaxation behavior for the mean field ising ferromagnet , for which exact results by suzuki and kubo @xcite were discussed in ref .",

    "only one single mode contributes to the relaxation in the mean field ferromagnet . at short times ( time zero to time",

    "we now return to the sk simulations .",
    "systems of size @xmath40 and @xmath41 were equilibrated using the procedure described in ref .",
    "simulations were made on @xmath42 independent disorder samples at each size with two clones simulated in parallel .",
    "( as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite two clones allow one to build up a noisy but unbiased estimate of the thermal fluctuations . here",
    "they are only used to decrease the thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "we performed @xmath43 monte carlo updates per site after thermalization , with measurements of @xmath14 made every 4 time intervals .",
    "both metropolis and heat bath relaxation runs were carried out .",
    "it can be noted that sk simulations are numerically demanding : there are about as many individual spin - spin interactions in an @xmath44 sk sample as in an @xmath45 sample in dimension @xmath46 .    in the @xmath47 data set , and that set only",
    ", it turns out that one specific disorder sample @xmath48 gives @xmath49 that are very far from the values for all the @xmath50 other samples of the same size .",
    "this is true for sample @xmath48 with either heat bath or metropolis updating schemes , and for all values of @xmath51 .",
    "for example at @xmath52 we have @xmath42 estimates for @xmath53 with a median equal to 0.0000040 , first and third quartiles equal to -0.0001183 and 0.0001292 respectively , and an isolated maximum value equal to 0.2946040 .",
    "this single outlier was omitted from the global analysis , since it would have led to a long @xmath8 distortion of our values of the mean @xmath54 and the statistical error . at long @xmath8",
    "when @xmath55 is very small , if one single sample by statistical accident is very uncharacteristic it can have a big influence on the mean and the error .",
    "note that in our simulation the thermal noise on @xmath55 is much smaller than the disorder noise .",
    "the temperatures at which measurements were made are @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "the standard dynamic finite size scaling rule exactly at the critical point can be written @xmath58\\ ] ] with @xmath59 .",
    "it is well known that quite generally finite size scaling is modified above the upper critical dimension @xmath60 , with the combination @xmath61 replaced by @xmath62 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the number of sites , namely @xmath63 is replaced by @xmath64 .",
    "the sk model is the infinite dimensional version of a model with upper critical dimension @xmath65 @xcite , and its scaling behavior is accordingly described by the effective length scale @xmath66 .",
    "this result can be obtained directly by noting that in the critical region the landau expansion of the free energy of the replicated model starts ( symbolically ) by @xmath67 with @xmath68 the @xmath69 by @xmath69 matrix @xmath70 where @xmath69 is the number of replica .",
    "the partition function takes the form @xmath71 , and after the change of variable @xmath72^{1/2}$ ] one obtains a free energy that is a function of @xmath73 , in agreement with the above statement since @xmath74 for this model .",
    "therefore for dimension @xmath75 and above ( including sk ) the effective isg `` length '' scale is @xmath76 .",
    "the mean field isg critical exponents are @xmath77 , @xmath74 , and @xmath78 .",
    "hence in the sk case the dynamic scaling becomes @xmath79 \\label{qctn}\\ ] ] so that in a critical temperature scaling plot one should expect @xmath80 to be a function @xmath81 $ ] .    in conditions where @xmath82 approaches the @xmath83 limit , the scaling rule becomes @xmath84 independent of @xmath5 .",
    "this is the situation for short times and large @xmath5 , figure 2 .     against @xmath85 in logarithmic coordinates at the critical temperature @xmath86 .",
    "the colors for @xmath87 are yellow , pink , cyan , green , red and black . for clarity",
    "the @xmath44 points are larger than the others .",

    "the color code is the same as in figure 2 .",
    "the blue curve is a stretched exponential @xmath89$].,width=336 ]    [ fig:3 ]    for reasons to be discussed below , in addition to testing this scaling form we want to test if the long time critical finite size scaling function @xmath90 $ ] is consistent with the stretched exponential form @xmath91 $ ] having the particular exponent value @xmath92 . in figure 3",
    "the scaled critical temperature relaxation data are plotted as @xmath93 on the y - axis against @xmath94 on the x - axis . the long time critical scaling rule",
    "is well obeyed over the whole range of sizes @xmath5 which have been studied ; beyond times of a few monte carlo steps @xmath80 is indeed an @xmath5-independent function @xmath81 $ ] to within the error bars for all @xmath8 and @xmath5 , with no visible sign of corrections to finite size scaling .",
    "the initial very short time relaxation ( figure 2 , invisible in figure 3 ) follows approximately the @xmath5-independent form @xmath9 as predicted . as can be seen in figure 3 , within the numerical precision the finite size scaling function",
    "is from then on compatible with a stretched exponential having exponent @xmath95 .",
    "for the three temperatures above @xmath0 , @xmath57 the raw @xmath96 data are shown in figures 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "it can be seen that at each of these temperatures the size dependence saturates with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath96 curves for the largest sizes coincide within the numerical error bars , so these data can be taken to represent the `` infinite '' @xmath5 limit behavior .",
    "the @xmath14 curves calculated with the expression given in ref .",
    "@xcite eq . 5.27 , are almost identical to the limiting numerical @xmath96 curves for @xmath97 and @xmath98 but the calculated curve for @xmath99 lies somewhat above the numerical data and has a rather different shape .",
    "the good quantitative agreement for the first two temperatures is perhaps fortuitous as the expression in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to a model with gaussian interactions , and a linearization approximation was made in the calculation .",
    "the authors expected the expression to become accurate only at temperatures well above @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is substantially validated by the numerical data .",
    "we can note that the simulations made with the metropolis updating rules ( not shown ) provide @xmath11 data which are very similar to the heatbath data but with a global shift in the time scale to times shorter by a factor of between @xmath100 and @xmath46 depending on the temperature .",
    "it can be shown that as a general rule @xmath14 will fall faster with metropolis updating than with heatbath / glauber updating ; the metropolis acceptance rate is higher than that for heatbath / glauber with a ratio of which depends on temperature .     against @xmath8 at the temperature @xmath97 .",

    "the fit ( blue curve ) is for the same parameters as in figure 4.,width=336 ]    [ fig:7 ]    the figures are of the same form as in the ferromagnetic example of figure 1 with an initial short time regime followed by a long time asymptote , except that the long time ferromagnet pure exponential asymptote is replaced by a stretched exponential . beyond the initial short time regime",
    "the stretched exponentials fit the large @xmath5 sk data to within the numerical precision .    if the stretched exponential form eq .",
    "[ qt ] is assumed , then @xmath102 an example of a plot of @xmath103 against @xmath8 is shown in figure 7 . for a pure exponential relaxation @xmath104 the data points would lie on a straight line going through the origin .",
    "this is clearly not the case . by analogy with the ferromagnetic behavior , beyond an initial short time region",

    "the relaxation time @xmath113 is of course increasing as @xmath0 is approached but with only three temperature points it is difficult to estimate a functional form for @xmath113 .",
    "however the most significant result is that the relaxation above @xmath0 in the effectively infinite size limit can be represented by stretched exponentials having exponents @xmath2 which are less than @xmath18 and which drop regularly as @xmath0 is approached .    from this result for the large @xmath5 limit relaxation data at the temperatures above",
    "@xmath16 together with the scaled finite size limited relaxation at criticality it can thus be concluded that in the paramagnetic region the sk model thermodynamic limit equilibrium relaxation can be treated as essentially stretched exponential , with an exponent @xmath2 which decreases continuously as the temperature is lowered .",
    "@xmath2 tends to a value @xmath114 at criticality .",
    "it should be underlined that this behavior has been followed down numerically though five orders of magnitude in @xmath14 at each temperature .",
    "it is instructive to compare with the situation for a finite dimension model .",
    "ogielski @xcite fitted thermodynamic limit @xmath14 data on the bimodal isg in dimension @xmath46 using an empirical function of the form @xmath115 \\label{qtog}\\ ] ] where an algebraic prefactor multiplies a stretched exponential .",
    "ogielski estimated @xmath116 which is close to recent estimates @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the values estimated for the stretched exponential exponent @xmath2 decrease regularly from @xmath118 at a temperature of about @xmath119 to @xmath120 at a temperature just above @xmath0 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath113 diverges as @xmath121 and the algebraic prefactor exponent @xmath122 decreases from @xmath123 at high temperatures to @xmath124 at @xmath16 .",
    "these equilibrium relaxation results were obtained from high quality simulations on very large samples ( up to @xmath125 ) and have never been improved on since .",
    "thus the general pattern of the paramagnetic state relaxation reported by ogielski in the @xmath4 isg and the observed behavior of the sk model described above show striking similarities ; above all both sets of data in the paramagnetic region are consistent with stretched exponential decay having an exponent @xmath2 tending to a critical value @xmath114 at @xmath16 .",
    "these two models represent the lowest integer dimension at which finite temperature isg ordering takes place and the infinite dimension mean field limit ( for which the rsb theory is well established ) respectively , so it would seem reasonable to expect that the same pattern of relaxation should hold for isgs at all intermediate dimensions also , both above and below the upper critical dimension ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "shortly after ogielski s work was published it was noted that his data were consistent with @xmath126 , and it was conjectured @xcite that stretched exponential relaxation with an exponent tending to precisely @xmath127 at criticality could be universal in isgs .",
    "the argument is briefly summarized in the next section .",
    "a thermodynamic phase transition can be regarded as a qualitative change in the topology of the thermodynamically attainable phase space with decreasing temperature , i.e. with decreasing internal energy .",
    "thus for a standard ferromagnetic transition a high temperature spherical phase space becomes more and more `` elliptic '' as the temperature is lowered and the number of attainable states drops ; finally at @xmath25 it splits into two ( up and down ) mirror - image subspaces . in a nave scenario based on rsb , for an isg at @xmath16 phase space shatters into a large number of inequivalent clusters . in euclidean space",
    "there is a well studied transition of this type , the percolation transition . for a concentration @xmath128",
    "there is a giant cluster of sites while just below @xmath129 there are only small inequivalent clusters .",
    "the total phase space of an @xmath5-spin @xmath130 ising system is an @xmath5 dimensional hypercube .",
    "relaxation of any @xmath5-spin ising system by successive single spin updates can be considered strictly as a random walk of the system point along near neighbor edges among the thermodynamically attainable vertices on this hypercube @xcite .",
    "it was argued @xcite that as random walks on full [ hyper]spherical surfaces result in pure exponential decay @xcite and random walks on threshold percolation clusters in euclidean space lead to sub - linear diffusion @xmath131 @xcite , random walks on threshold percolation clusters inscribed on [ hyper]spheres would be characterized by `` sub - exponential '' relaxation of the form @xmath132 $ ] with the same exponents @xmath133 as in the corresponding euclidean space .",
    "this was demonstrated numerically for @xmath134 to @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "a hypercube being topologically equivalent to a hypersphere , on a diluted hypercube at threshold @xcite random walks can be expected to lead to stretched exponential relaxation with exponent @xmath95 .",
    "successive explicit numerical studies of random walks on the randomly occupied hypercube at @xmath136 @xcite have confirmed this .",
    "it is important to note that the limiting behavior for relaxation due to diffusion on sparse graphs has been shown analytically to take the form of a stretched exponential with exponent @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "it was further conjectured @xcite that in a complex ising system such as an isg the phase transition would be analogous to a percolation transition in configuration space .",
    "detailed `` rough landscape '' models for the configuration space of complex systems have been widely invoked ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; these models can be thought of in terms of linked basins with a gradual dilution of the links leading finally to a percolation threshold .",
    "as the critical properties of a percolation transition are very robust , if the configuration space percolation threshold scenario is valid the basic critical behavior should not be sensitive to model details ; in particular stretched exponential relaxation with exponent @xmath127 should be observed generically in isgs whatever the space dimension and possibly also in a wider class of complex systems .",
    "the present numerical sk results taken together with ogielski s @xmath4 isg analysis @xcite can be taken as a strong empirical indication of a universal equilibrium relaxation pattern for isgs in the paramagnetic regime : stretched exponential decay eq .",
    "[ qt ] having an exponent @xmath2 which tends to @xmath127 when the relaxation time diverges at the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "auto - correlation function decay at the percolation transition on the randomly occupied hypercube @xcite has precisely this form , suggesting that the isg phase transition can indeed be considered in terms of a percolation transition in phase space .",
    "the same type of relaxation pattern has been observed in many other complex system studies , both numerical and experimental .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that the physical scenario could have implications for a wide class of transitions , extending well beyond the isg family .",
    "we would like to thank ney lemke for an instructive discussion and for communicating his unpublished data .",
