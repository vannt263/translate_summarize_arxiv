    "this approach is based on the study of  absorption \" features imprinted on the gev - tev spectra by the interaction of @xmath2-rays with ebl photons through the pair - creation process ( @xmath4 ; see e.g. @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "blazars represent a very useful class of @xmath2-ray beamers , being numerous over a wide range of redshifts , very luminous ( enhanced by relativistic beaming ) and long - lasting sources . however , they are far from being standard candles , and therefore the constraints on the ebl are _ always _ heavily dependent on our understanding of the blazar intrinsic emission and physical properties .    nevertheless , it is possible to derive meaningful constraints if the intrinsic blazar properties implied by certain ebl spectra are very far from the known or expected range , and/or if they become inconsistent with other aspects of the blazars spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",

    "the convolution of the @xmath2-@xmath2 cross section with the ebl spectrum yields an energy - dependent attenuation . because the resulting optical depth @xmath9 mostly increases with @xmath2-ray energy , the observed @xmath2-ray spectrum emerging at the end of the travel path",
    "is steeper than the initial , intrinsic spectrum emitted by the source ( namely , the photon index @xmath10 ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the attenuation factor @xmath5 is plotted as a function of energy .",
    "limits on the ebl can thus be derived if the intrinsic spectrum required by a particular ebl intensity ( or shape ) is too anomalous typically too hard with respect to the known physics of the source ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several points can be noted from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] :    * 1 ) * different ebl wavebands ( having different slopes ) affect each part of the @xmath2-ray spectrum in a different way , yielding a complex deformation shape . however , over some ranges ( namely 0.2 - 1 tev and 2 - 8 tev ) , it approximates a power - law shape .",
    "that is , if the intrinsic spectrum is a power - law , the observed spectrum can be well fitted by a power - law of steeper index .    * 2 ) * the amount of steepening @xmath11 increases both with distance and ebl intensity .",
    "thus redshift gives leverage : the same uncertainty in ebl flux @xmath12 causes a higher @xmath11 at larger distances .",
    "more distant sources provides therefore more sensitivity for ebl constraints , but at the same time they suffer stronger attenuation , yielding much lower statistics . as a result",
    ", there is an optimal range of redshifts that provides the best compromise between ebl - sensitivity and statistical error , and thus gives the most stringent ebl limits . with the present detectors , it is around @xmath13 .    *",
    "3 ) * if the ebl number density @xmath14 ( i.e. the ebl sed @xmath15 ) , the optical depth @xmath16 becomes @xmath17 . where @xmath18 , the optical depth becomes therefore independent of energy ( @xcite ) . in such case",
    "_ there is no steepening _ : the absorbed spectrum reproduces the original shape , simply attenuated by a constant factor .",
    "this is what partly happens in the ebl waveband 3 - 10 @xmath19 , according to all most recent ebl calculations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it causes a flattening feature in the attenuation curve between @xmath201 - 2 and 8 - 9 tev , where the observed @xmath2-ray spectrum partly recovers its intrinsic slope and thus can appear harder than in the 0.2 - 1 tev band-@xmath2 absorption can make a gamma - ray spectrum even _ harder _ than originally emitted , when @xmath21 ( e.g. for a planckian distribution ) .",
    "this is indeed an effective way to explain very hard @xmath2-ray spectra ( @xcite ) . ]    * 4 ) * therefore , _ no cutoff is produced by ebl absorption between 0.2 and 8 tev _ !",
    "any cutoff or steepening seen in this energy range should be intrinsic to the source spectrum .",
    "[ fig1 ] also clarifies why almost all `` data points '' reported on the so - called  gamma - ray horizon \" plots in literature ( showing the @xmath22 at which @xmath23 as a function of redshift ) are basically meaningless : there is no way to measure an ebl cutoff between 0.1 and 10 tev using only vhe data .",
    "the only two ebl cutoffs are between the he and vhe bands , i.e. between 20 and 200 gev ( thus requiring a fermi - lat spectrum ) , or above 8 - 10 tev ( for which only two blazars have been detected with sufficient statistics so far ) .",
    "* 5 ) * the @xmath2-ray steepening is determined by the difference in optical depth between the two ends of an observed vhe band .",
    "therefore any spectral steepening ( and consequently any ebl upper limit ) can always be counteracted and canceled by an appropriate increase of the optical depth ( i.e. of the ebl flux ) at the lower @xmath2-ray energies , so to equalize the optical depths . in the 0.1 - 1 tev range , this is obtained by increasing the uv flux with respect to the nir flux ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , _ any limit on the ebl always depends on the assumption on the uv flux _ , by definition .",
    "all claims of  new \" methods for  model - independent \" or  shape - independent \" ebl limits ( e.g. @xcite ) are therefore essentially incorrect , even if their ( often hidden ) assumptions are reasonable and in fact commonly used ( e.g. assuming that the uv flux is always lower than the opt - nir flux ) .",
    "until 2005 , the large uncertainty especially around 0.8 - 3 @xmath19   ( a factor 5 - 10@xmath24 between lower limits and direct estimates ) caused a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of blazars gamma - ray spectra . an observed tev spectrum could be the result either of a hard intrinsic spectrum attenuated by a high - density ebl , or of a soft intrinsic spectrum less absorbed by a low - density ebl . in both cases , the required intrinsic tev spectrum was well within the typical range of spectra shown so far by blazars , so no useful constraint could be derived ( with the exception of the 2 - 10 @xmath19  range , see @xcite ) .",
    "this ambiguity essentially undermined our capability to study blazars , since it corresponded to large differences both in energy and luminosity of their sed @xmath2-ray peak .",
    "in 2005 , however , the hess observations of the bl lac objects 1es 1101 - 232 ( @xmath25=0.186 ) and h 2356 - 309 ( @xmath25=0.165 ) provided a fundamental breakthrough ( @xcite ) . the observed @xmath2-ray spectra ( detected between 0.2 and 1 - 3 tev ) were much harder than expected for their redshift , implying extremely hard intrinsic spectra ( @xmath26 ) in case of high ebl densities ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "such hard spectra were never seen in the closer , less absorbed objects and were at odds with all the known blazar physics and phenomenology .",
    "they were also not supported by same - epoch multiwavelength observations of their sed ( @xcite ) .",
    "a low ebl intensity could instead accomodate all the new results within the typical range of blazar properties .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic spectra were not harder than @xmath27=1.5 an upper limit could be derived , which resulted very close to the lower limits given by the integrated light of galaxies ( details in @xcite ) .",
    "this result is now further corroborated by several other sources and observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result has three main consequences : 1 ) it pins down the origin of the ebl , showing that at these wavelenghts it is strongly dominated by the direct starlight from galaxies , excluding a strong contribution from other sources like pop - iii stars ( e.g. @xcite ) ; 2 ) it means that the intergalactic space is more transparent to @xmath2-rays than previously thought , thus enlarging the @xmath2-ray horizon ; 3 ) it strongly reduces the ambiguity on blazars tev spectra .",
    "there is a lot of confusion in literature on the validity of the @xmath27=1.5 hardness limit and on the reasons of its adoption .",
    "it is important to understand that _ this is not the hardest possible theoretical spectrum _ in blazars , and was never introduced as such ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed there are many possible mechanisms to produce extremely hard gamma - ray spectra in blazars , such as bulk - motion comptonization ( @xcite ) , internal absoption on narrow - banded photon fields ( @xcite ) , uncooled particle acceleration spectra or fine - tuned shock acceleration ( yielding however @xmath28 , e.g. @xcite ) , a low - energy cutoff in the particle distribution at very high energy ( e.g. @xcite ) , or relativistic maxwellian distributions ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the @xmath27=1.5 limit is a reference value , a benchmark that so far marks _ the borderline between reality and speculation_. observations do show that blazars can have photon spectra with @xmath29 ( directly seen in synchrotron or inverse compton emissions ) , and these can be produced with standard shock acceleration and cooling mechanisms without invoking special conditions or fine - tuning . on the other hand , much harder spectra have never been significantly detected in blazars so far , at high particle energies , neither directly or by synchrotron emission .",
    "the alternative scenarios , though not excluded by observations , are not suggested by them either , and in some cases require extreme fine - tuning to avoid conflicts with multiwavelength sed data .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath27=1.5 value should not be considered a sharp , hard limit . at",
    "any given redshift , ebl absorption establishes a one - to - one relation between the observed and intrinsic @xmath2-ray spectral slope .",
    "thus a different assumption shifts the ebl limit accordingly , but only a large change ( e.g. @xmath30 ) can effectively impact the conclusion of a low ebl . for example , in the case of 1es 1101 - 232 , a shift of @xmath31 ( e.g. by assuming @xmath32 ) affects the ebl limit by no more than 10% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the opt - nir upper limit is therefore robust to such changes in blazar assumptions , which are of the same order of the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the @xmath2-ray spectra .",
    "the only relevant issue left , therefore , is to assess theoretically and observationally if blazars do have emission components characterized by _ extremely _ hard spectra ( e.g. @xmath33 or less ) or not , and when they produce them .",
    "despite the several possible scenarios for producing very hard spectra in blazars , there are two main reasons why a low ebl density seems still the correct solution .    the first concerns the emitting particles spectrum .",
    "most of these scenarios invoke very hard particle spectra , either as a pile - up / maxwellian distribution or as a low - energy cutoff , and suppressing radiative cooling .",
    "these mechanisms look feasable even in a one - zone synchrotron self - compton scenario for blazars ( see @xcite for a recent comprehensive discussion ) .",
    "however , since the synchrotron emission ( which in these objects correspond to optical  x - ray energies ) traces directly the particle spectrum , such hard features should appear in the synchrotron spectrum as well , at some energies and at least in some epochs .",
    "instead , they have never been observed in more than 30 years of x - rays and optical / ir observations of blazars , requiring a  cosmic conspiracy \" to always hide the hard emission below a more normal component or in seldom - observed bands ( mm ? ) .",
    "intriguingly , there was a recent claim of possible observational evidence for a low - energy cutoff in the swift data of 1es 0229 + 200 , as an unusually high x - ray - to - uv flux ratio ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a bug was found in the calculation of the effective area of the x - ray data , and the correct result ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) show a spectrum in line with all other objects and observations .",
    "future observations with alma ( mm ) and nustar ( hard x - ray ) may provide further insights .",
    "dropping the requirement of a hard particle spectrum , internal absorption on a narrow - banded photon field can make the gamma - ray spectrum extremely hard ( @xcite ) however , large fluxes in the gev range are required , and these seem now excluded by the low fluxes or non - detection of the hard - tev sources with fermi - lat ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second reason for a low ebl density ( and thus for @xmath34 ) is that a high ebl would require a dramatic change of blazar properties in a very narrow range of redshifts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a high ebl would create a sharp dicothomy in blazars spectra around @xmath35 : all sources below this redshift would have @xmath36 , while all blazars above this redshift would have always @xmath37 , all other properties being equal or very similar .",
    "there is no known reason , observational bias or evolution parameter that can explain such an abrupt change of properties in such small redshift range .",
    "instead , a low ebl intensity makes the range of tev blazar spectra consistent among each other at any redshift sampled so far .",
    "therefore , though not yet  bullet - proof \" , until proven otherwise a low ebl seems the preferable solution according to occam s razor .",
    "( see also @xcite for the cosmological problems to explain a high ebl flux ) .",
    "since the ebl photon field is the same for all sources , and evolving in redshift , the spectral - hardness limits from different blazars and in different energy bands can be combined to constrain the ebl over a wide range of wavelengths , and in a more stringent way than allowed by each single object ( @xcite ) .",
    "each new spectrum can take advantage of the previous limits , forming a chain of constraints that starts with ( and depends on ) the assumption on the uv flux . with the reasonable hypothesis that the uv background is lower than the opt - nir one ( e.g. around 2 - 6 nw / m2 sr ) ,",
    "blazars spectra between 0.1 and 1 tev pin down the opt - nir flux very close to the galaxy counts limit ( @xcite ) .    with this limit ,",
    "the blazar spectra between @xmath38 and 10 tev ( 1es 0229 + 200 @xcite and 1es 1426 + 428 , @xcite ) constrain the ebl spectrum between 2 and 10 @xmath19   to a slope close to @xmath39 , again very close to the lower limits from galaxy counts ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is possible because the opt - nir limit precludes the possibility of increasing the flux at @xmath201 @xmath19   to reduce the difference in optical depth between 1 and 10 tev ( see sect .",
    "2 ) .    the consequent upper limit at 10 @xmath19   constrains the rising of the ebl sed towards the far - infrared hump , which is determined by warm and cold dust emission .",
    "this band is probed by @xmath2-rays between @xmath40 and 100 tev .",
    "so far , only two close - by objects have been measured up to 15 - 20 tev , thanks to hegra observations : mkn 421 ( @xmath25=0.031 , @xcite ) and mkn 501 ( @xmath25=0.034 , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the hegra spectrum of mkn 501 seems to have problems with the most recent ebl calculations , which cause an up - turn or pile - up at the highest energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is the modern version of the so called  tev - fir background crisis \" ( see e.g. @xcite ) , caused years ago by a first very high estimate of the 50 @xmath19  ebl flux .",
    "however the information on warm dust and the @xmath2-ray statistic are still insufficient to draw any sensible conclusion .",
    "more data @xmath41 tev are needed ( hopefully from cta ) .",
    "vhe data sample mainly the local ebl ( @xmath42 ) . to probe the ebl evolution over cosmic time and in the uv band , sources up to @xmath43 and data in the 10 - 100 gev range are needed .",
    "the first results from fermi - lat ( @xcite ) are in agreement with the vhe limits and with the most recent ebl evolution models . to this respect , however , grbs might turn out to be more useful @xmath2-ray sources , given that ebl and blazar - intrinsic evolutionary effects might be very difficult to disentangle ( @xcite ) .    at vhe , instead , cta is not expected to improve the opt - nir limits per se , contrary to various claims .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , there is not much room for improvement !",
    "the present upper limits already match the lower limits by galaxy counts quite closely ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) second , even with infinite @xmath2-ray statistics , it remains the unavoidable systematic uncertainty in blazar modeling .",
    "the small @xmath44 induced by the residual ebl uncertainty between lower and upper limits can be typically accomodated with very small changes in blazar parameters , for a given set of multiwavelength data .",
    "the main question to be addressed is if our blazar assumptions are correct ( and in such case the ebl is already pinned down ) or are not ( and in this case by how much ) . in the latter case , the entire construction must be revisited , since it is our understanding of the gamma - ray sources that changes completely .",
    "it is on this aspect , on blazar physics , that cta is expected to provide the most significant improvements and to test our assumptions by finding counter - examples .",
    "this can be done by monitoring more low - redshift objects in the tev range ( to detect directly @xmath45 ) and by measuring more high - redshift spectra ( to find those for which @xmath46 is incompatible with galaxy counts ; @xcite ) .    in conclusion",
    ", a low ebl close to galaxy counts seems the  convergent solution \" , despite some uncertainties on blazar physics . however , there are still some fundamental aspects of blazars acceleration and emission mechanisms not yet understood , which present and future observations are testing .",
    "the ebl limits obtained so far are robust against small changes in blazars assumptions , but they all depend , by construction , on the assumption of a low diffuse uv flux .",
