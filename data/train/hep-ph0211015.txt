    "one of the current interests in the strong interaction physics is how the properties of hadrons change at finite temperature and/or density . to study",
    "this has become increasingly important since it is closely related to the data obtained in currently carried and future planned high energy heavy ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "a novel feature at finite temperature and/or density is the absence of lorentz symmetry due to the existence of the heat bath and/or matter and therefore , the spectral functions of hadrons depend on two rotationally invariant variables in addition to temperature and/or density , for example four momentum squared and spatial momentum squared . since the hadron spectra observed in the heavy ion collision experiments have various spatial momenta , it is important to know theoretically how the spectral functions depend on the spatial momentum in order to draw a conclusion about the change of the properties of hadrons at finite temperature and/or density .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the spatial momentum dependence of the spectral functions and the pole of the propagator in the complex four momentum square plane for hadrons at finite temperature .",

    "as is well known , naive perturbative expansion breaks down at finite temperature and proper resummation of higher order terms is necessary @xcite . by calculating the self energies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the opt to one - loop and analyzing their spectral functions , we study how the spectral functions depend on the temperature and the spatial momentum .",
    "we also search for the poles of the propagators .",
    "the properties of @xmath1 at finite temperature at rest were studied in @xcite .",

    "this momentum maximizes the imaginary part of the self - energy , which is proportional to the integral times the kinematical factor @xmath131 .",
    "this is because around @xmath132 the integral is proportional to @xmath72 and cancels the kinematical factor , which makes the imaginary part of the self - energy constant , while around @xmath130 the integral has a sharp peak and the dependence of the kinematical factor can be neglected .",

    "we reproduced the spectral functions in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels in the previous work and found that the pole , which is responsible for the threshold enhancement of the spectral function in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , is different from the one for the peak at zero temperature .",
    "secondly , we discussed the spatial - momentum dependence .",
    "when the temperature is low the spatial momentum dependence is also small .",
    "as the temperature becomes higher the spatial momentum dependence becomes also large .",
    "when the spatial momentum is smaller than the temperature , the spectral functions do not deviate much from those at zero spatial momentum .",
    "once the spatial momentum becomes comparable with the temperature , the deviation becomes considerable . as the momentum becomes much larger than the temperature",
    ", thermal effects effectively decrease .",
    "these observations have an implication for heavy - ion collision experiments : when one extracts information about the change of intrinsic properties of hadrons at finite temperature from their spectral functions measured in high energy heavy - ion collision experiments , one should keep in mind spatial momentum dependence discussed in the present paper .",
    "we expect that the essential part of the results in the present paper holds for other hadrons , since it is based basically on the kinematics of the particles under consideration and thermal particles in the heat bath .",
    "finally , a comment on the higher - loop effects is in order . at finite temperature there",
    "exist various physical processes which are not taken into account in the present one - loop calculation .",
    "if we include those processes in the calculation , the structure of the spectral functions might be significantly modified by the following reason : the sigma meson at zero temperature has large width due to the strong coupling with two pions .",
    "it was found in the one - loop calculation that the spectrum of @xmath1 at finite temperature is enhanced near the @xmath110 threshold .",
    "this is because as the temperature increases the mass of @xmath1 decreases while that of @xmath0 increases .",
    "however , what is not taken into account in the one - loop calculation is the effect of the thermal width of @xmath0 in the process @xmath110 .",
    "this is taken into account in the calculation to two - loop order .",
