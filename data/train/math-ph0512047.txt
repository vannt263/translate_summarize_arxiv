    "recently , a remarkable connection between integrable models and combinatorics has emerged .",
    "it first appeared in a series of papers concerning the xxz spin chain and the temperley ",
    "lieb ( tl ) loop model @xcite and which culminated with the so - called razumov ",
    "stroganov ( rs ) conjecture @xcite .",
    "one of the main observations of @xcite , a weak corollary of the rs conjecture , is that the sum of entries of the properly normalized ground state vector of the tl(1 ) loop model is ( unexpectedly ! ) equal to the number of alternating sign matrices .",
    "this result was eventually proved in @xcite by using the _ integrability _ of the tl loop model in the following way : the model is generalized by introducing @xmath2 complex numbers ( spectral parameters , or inhomogeneities ) in the problem , where @xmath2 is the size of the system .",
    "the ground state entries become polynomials in these variables , and integrability provides many new tools for analyzing them , leading eventually to the exact computation of their sum , identified as the so - called izergin ",
    "korepin ( ik ) determinant , known to specialize to the number of alternating sign matrices in the homogeneous limit @xcite .",
    "note that in this work , the meaning of the spectral parameters is not very transparent ; in particular , it is unclear how to generalize the full rs conjecture in their presence .",
    "next , it was observed in @xcite that the polynomials obtained above really belong to a one - parameter family of solutions of a certain set of linear equations , in which the parameter @xmath0 has been set equal to a cubic root of unity .",
    "this observation is not obvious because the equations for generic @xmath0 are not a simple eigenvector equation ; in fact , as explained in @xcite , they are precisely the quantum knizhnik  zamolodchikov ( @xmath0kz ) equations at level 1 for the algebra @xmath3 . furthermore ,",
    "in the `` rational '' limit @xmath4 , these polynomials have a remarkable geometric interpretation : they are equivariant hilbert polynomials ( or `` multidegrees '' ) of @xmath5 orbital varieties @xmath6 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , which are extensions of the joseph polynomials @xcite . note that here , the spectral parameters quite naturally appear as the basis of weights of @xmath7 . in @xcite , these ideas were generalized to higher algebras @xmath8 , which correspond to the orbital varieties @xmath9 .    here , we pursue a _ different _ type of generalization : we investigate orbital varieties corresponding to the other infinite series of simple lie algebras : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; but we stick to the @xmath3 case by choosing the orbital varieties @xmath6 , @xmath13 a complex matrix in the fundamental representation .",
    "indeed , we show below that such orbital varieties are related to the same loop model , but with different _ boundary conditions _ ( corresponding to variants of the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra ) .",
    "furthermore , one can now @xmath0-deform the resulting polynomials to produce solutions of @xmath0kz equations of type @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and set @xmath0 to be a cubic root of unity .",
    "taking the homogeneous limit , the entries become integer numbers , which we conjecture to be related to _ symmetry classes _ of alternating sign matrices and/or plane partitions ; in particular we identify the sums of entries .    in what follows we state most results without proofs ; some will appear in a joint paper with a.  knutson @xcite on a closely related subject .",
    "let @xmath17 be a simple complex lie algebra of rank @xmath18 , @xmath19 a borel subalgebra .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the corresponding cartan subalgebra and @xmath22 is the space of nilpotent elements of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath23 are borel and cartan subgroups .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the weyl group of @xmath17 , and @xmath25 its standard generators , where @xmath26 runs over the set of simple roots of @xmath17 .",
    "fixing an orbit @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 acting by conjugation , one can consider the irreducible components of @xmath30 , which are called orbital varieties .",
    "even though much of what follows can be done for any orbital varieties , we focus below on the following special case : we fix an irreducible representation @xmath31 ( of dimension @xmath2 ) and consider the scheme @xmath32 .",
    "the underlying set is precisely a @xmath30 , where @xmath33 is any element of @xmath34 such that @xmath35 is of maximal rank . in some sense ,",
    "its components are the `` simplest possible '' orbital varieties .",
    "it is known that there exists a representation of the weyl group @xmath24 on the vector space @xmath36 of formal linear combinations of orbital varieties ( springer / joseph representation ) ; for each @xmath29-orbit , it is an irreducible representation .",
    "we use the following explicit form of the representation : note that orbital varieties are invariant under @xmath37 , where @xmath23 acts by conjugation and @xmath38 acts by overall scaling .",
    "we can therefore consider equivariant cohomology @xmath39 and in particular via the inclusion map from each orbital variety @xmath40 to the space @xmath22 , the unit of @xmath41 is pushed forward to some cohomology class @xmath42 in @xmath43 $ ] , that is a polynomial in @xmath44 variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( the @xmath18 simple roots plus the @xmath38 weight ) , sometimes called _ multidegree _ of @xmath40 .",
    "suppressing the @xmath38 action , that is setting @xmath49 , one recovers the joseph polynomials @xcite .",
    "the way that @xmath24 acts on these polynomials can be described explicitly , by extending slightly the results of hotta @xcite to include the additional @xmath38 action .",
    "one starts by associating to each simple root @xmath26 a certain geometric construction , which we briefly recall . for @xmath50 write @xmath51 where @xmath26 runs over positive roots , @xmath52 being a vector of weight @xmath26 .",
    "define @xmath53 , and @xmath54 to be lvy subgroup whose lie algebra is @xmath55 . starting from an orbital variety @xmath40 , we distinguish two cases :    * @xmath56 .",
    "then set @xmath57 . * @xmath58 .",
    "then let @xmath54 acts by conjugation : the top - dimensional components of @xmath59 are again orbital varieties ; set @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the multiplicity of @xmath62 in @xmath59 .",
    "these elementary operations have a counterpart when acting on multidegrees , and a simple calculation shows that both cases are covered by a single formula :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the reflection orthogonal to the root @xmath26 in @xmath65 $ ] , and @xmath66 is the associated _ divided difference operator _ , whereas on the left hand side @xmath25 implements right action on the @xmath42 , namely @xmath67 .",
    "one can check that @xmath68 is a representation of the weyl group @xmath24 on polynomials .",
    "note that at @xmath49 , we recover the natural action of @xmath24 ( up to a sign , with our conventions ) .",
    "let us define the operator @xmath69 which acts in the space @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 being a formal parameter . rewriting slightly the relation above",
    "we find that @xmath64 acts as @xmath72 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath64 , just like the @xmath25 , satisfy the weyl group relations , we find that the operators @xmath73 also satisfy those . in the case of non - exceptional lie algebras , there are only 2 types of edges in the dynkin diagram , and therefore we have coxeter relations of the form @xmath74 , where @xmath75 depending on whether @xmath76 , there is no edge , a single or a double edge between @xmath26 and @xmath77 . writing these relations for @xmath78 and eliminating the @xmath64 , we find that relations with @xmath79 correspond respectively to the _ unitarity _ equation : @xmath80 the _ yang ",
    "equation : @xmath81 and the _ boundary yang  baxter _ ( or reflection ) equation : @xmath82 whereas the case @xmath83 expresses a simple commutation relation for distant vertices .",
    "indeed one recognizes in @xmath84 a standard form of the rational solution of the yang ",
    "baxter equation , the parameter @xmath71 playing the role of difference of spectral parameters . thus the multidegrees @xmath85 are closely connected to integrable models with rational dependence on spectral parameters , as will be discussed now .",
    "before doing so , let us remark that in the special case investigated here of orbital varieties associated to @xmath6 , the @xmath25 obey more than just the coxeter relations .",
    "in the @xmath86 case they actually generate a quotient of the symmetric group algebra @xmath87 known as the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra @xmath88 ( here 2 is the value of the parameter in the definition of the algebra , as will be explained below ) .",
    "the same type of phenomena will be described for other simple lie algebras , and will lead to variants of the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra ; in particular , the `` bulk '' ( i.e. everything but a finite number of edges at the boundary ) of the dynkin diagrams being sequences of simple edges , these variants will only differ at the level of `` boundary conditions '' of the model .",
    "let us now discuss the meaning of the equation @xmath89 where @xmath64 is the reflection associated to the root @xmath26 acting on the `` spectral parameters '' @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath72 is a certain linear operator defined above acting in the space @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath90 is a vector in that space .",
    "when @xmath84 is the @xmath91-matrix ( or boundary @xmath91-matrix ) of some integrable model , such equations are satisfied by eigenvectors of the corresponding integrable transfer matrix .",
    "more generally , these equations appear in the context of the quantum knizhnik  zamolodchikov ( @xmath0kz ) equation , in connection with the representation theory of affine quantum groups @xcite . in either case",
    ", it is known that we need an additional equation to fix the @xmath42 entirely .",
    "define @xmath92 to be the semi - direct product of @xmath24 and of the weight lattice of @xmath17 .",
    "it contains as a finite index subgroup the usual affine weyl group defined as the coxeter group of the affinized dynkin diagram . just like the affine weyl group",
    ", it has a natural action on @xmath21 and therefore on @xmath65 $ ] which extends the action of @xmath24 generated by the reflections @xmath93 ; by definition , in this representation , an element of the weight lattice acts as translation in @xmath21 of the weight multiplied by @xmath94 ( @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the level of the @xmath0kz equation and @xmath97 is the dual coxeter number of @xmath98 ) .",
    "then we claim that one can extend the representation of @xmath24 on @xmath70 $ ] ( the operators @xmath73 ) into a representation of @xmath92 , in such a way that each element of @xmath99 is the product of its natural action on @xmath65 $ ] and of a @xmath65$]-linear operator .",
    "describing here the geometric procedure that leads to this action is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the action will however be described explicitly in each of the cases below .",
    "an important property is that if one sets @xmath49 the representation of @xmath92 factors through the projection @xmath100 .",
    "so the @xmath38 action actually produces the affinization .",
    "imposing that @xmath101 be invariant under the action of the whole group @xmath99 leads to a full set of equations , which are precisely equivalent to the so - called rational @xmath0kz equation ( or more precisely , a generalization of it for arbitrary dynkin diagram , the original @xmath0kz equation corresponding to the case @xmath86 ) at level @xmath102 ; and it turns out that they have a unique polynomial solution of the prescribed degree ( up to multiplication by a scalar ) .",
    "the integrability suggests how to @xmath0-deform the above construction .",
    "indeed , we have considered thus far @xmath91-matrices that form so - called _ rational _ solutions of the yang  baxter equation , and @xmath101 s that are solutions of the rational @xmath0kz equation .",
    "it is known however that the trigonometric @xmath91-matrices are a special degeneration of a one - parameter family of _ trigonometric _ solutions of the yang  baxter equation , depending on a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "setting @xmath103 , one customarily uses exponentiated  multiplicative \" spectral parameters of the form @xmath104 .",
    "we then look for polynomial solutions @xmath101 of these parameters , to the corresponding trigonometric @xmath0kz equations .",
    "the rational solutions are then recovered from the trigonometric ones via the limit @xmath105 , at the first non - trivial order in @xmath106 .",
    "the details of the bulk and boundary @xmath91-matrices will be given below for the cases @xmath86 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we thus obtain , for any @xmath0 , a representation of the group @xmath99 , the @xmath24 relations satisfied by the @xmath73 and more generally the @xmath99 relations being undeformed .    in terms of the new variables",
    "@xmath104 living in @xmath23 , the natural action of an element of the weight lattice @xmath107 ( as the abelian subgroup of @xmath99 ) is the multiplication by @xmath108 . since for all simple lie algebras , @xmath107 has half - integer coordinates , we reach the important conclusion that when @xmath109 , this action becomes trivial . therefore , all operators associated to the weight lattice by the procedure outlined in the previous section become @xmath65$]-linear ( i.e.  correspond to finite - dimensional operators on @xmath36 after evaluation of the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) . in this case",
    "they are simply the scattering matrices of @xcite , and they commute with the usual ( inhomogeneous ) integrable transfer matrix of the model .",
    "this implies that @xmath101 is an eigenvector of the latter ; in fact , we can call it `` ground state eigenvector '' because in the physical situation where the transfer matrix elements are positive , the perron  frobenius theorem applies and the eigenvalue @xmath102 of @xmath101 is the largest eigenvalue in modulus .    the value @xmath110 ( also called  razumov  stroganov point \" ) is henceforth quite special and deserves a particular study . in particular , in the homogeneous limit where the spectral parameters @xmath111 are specialized to zero , @xmath101 can be normalized so that its entries are all _ non - negative integers _ , and we are interested in their combinatorial significance , in relation to the counting of alternating sign matrices and/or plane partitions .",
    "we do not claim to have a full understanding of the general correspondence principle between simple lie algebras and these combinatorial problems , but we will perform a case - by - case study for @xmath86 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    a last remark is in order . as we shall see , it is simple to see that the solutions @xmath101 to the @xmath48 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath0kz equations obey recursion relations , that allow to obtain the rank @xmath18 case from rank @xmath44 , hence we will content ourselves with the detailed description for @xmath18 with a given parity , namely @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "we review the @xmath86 case , already explored in @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the fact that there are @xmath118 of these new variables @xmath119 , the spectral parameters , as opposed to the @xmath18 simple roots , is a reflection of the usual embedding @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 ) is simply the space of upper triangular ( resp .",
    "strictly upper triangular ) matrices of size @xmath2 , and the orbital varieties under consideration are the irreducible components of the scheme @xmath121 .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath122 even , which is technically simpler .      in general , @xmath123 nilpotent orbits are classified by their jordan decomposition type , which can be expressed as a young diagram ; the orbital varieties are then indexed by standard young tableaux ( syt ) .",
    "the condition @xmath6 ensures that only young diagrams with at most 2 rows can appear ( blocks in the jordan decomposition are of size at most 2 ) , and it is easy to check that all orbits are in the closure of the largest orbit , whose young diagram is of the form @xmath124 .",
    "it is convenient to describe the corresponding syt by `` link patterns '' , that is @xmath2 points on a line connected in the upper - half plane via @xmath125 non - intersecting arches , see fig .",
    "[ linkpatt ] .",
    "the numbers in the first ( resp .",
    "second ) row of the syt are the labels of the openings ( resp .",
    "closings ) of the arches .",
    "there are @xmath126 such configurations .    0.5 cm    in this language , one has a rather convenient description of orbital varieties @xcite , which we mention for the sake of completeness . indeed , to each orbital variety @xmath40 we associate the upper triangular matrix @xmath127 with @xmath128 if points labelled @xmath129 and @xmath130 are connected by an arch , @xmath131 , @xmath132 otherwise .",
    "then @xmath133 , @xmath14 acting by conjugation .",
    "equivalently , @xmath40 is given by the following set of equations : ( i ) @xmath6 and ( ii ) @xmath134 , @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the rank of the @xmath137 lower - left rectangle .",
    "@xmath138 @xmath139    it is equally simple to describe the action of the weyl group , namely the symmetric group @xmath140 . rather than the generators corresponding to the simple roots : @xmath141 , @xmath117 used so far",
    ", it proves simpler to consider the action of the projectors @xmath142 in the symmetric group algebra .",
    "the operator @xmath143 acts on link patterns @xmath40 by connecting the arches ending at @xmath129 and @xmath144 and creates a new little arch between these 2 points ; this action is described on fig .",
    "when a closed loop is formed , it is erased but contributes a weight @xmath145 .",
    "the @xmath0-deformed version of this is obtained by attaching a weight @xmath146 to each erased loop , thus leading to the following ( pictorially clear ) relations : @xmath147=0\\quad |i - j|>1\\ ] ] all indices taking values in @xmath148 .",
    "these are the defining relations of the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra @xmath149 .",
    "when @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath145 , it is simply a quotient of the symmetric group algebra . alternatively , the deformed generators @xmath151 satisfy the usual relations of the hecke algebra ( of which the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra is a quotient ) .",
    "in what follows , one special element of @xmath152 will be needed : it is the cyclic rotation @xmath153 .",
    "its effect is to rotate the endpoints of the link patterns : @xmath154 without changing their connectivity .",
    "it can also be expressed as : @xmath155 .      for each simple root @xmath111 , we have the trigonometric @xmath91-matrix : @xmath156 where the @xmath157 generate @xmath152 and act in the space of link patterns as explained above .",
    "we first write the system of equations : @xmath158 where @xmath159 acts by interchanging multiplicative spectral parameters @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the polynomial @xmath101 of the @xmath162 s , homogeneous of degree @xmath163 .",
    "these equations are supplemented by the `` affinized '' equation satisfied by @xmath101 .",
    "since the affine dynkin diagram @xmath164 is a circular chain , this equation quite naturally involves the cyclic rotation @xmath153 .",
    "define the operator @xmath31 on @xmath165 $ ] which shifts the variables @xmath166 according to the rule : @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 . then the additional equation is @xmath170 together with this equation , the above system forms the so - called level one @xmath0kz equation .",
    "we claim that the @xmath171 and @xmath172 generate together @xmath99 . in order to see that , it is sufficient to build the @xmath2 generators @xmath173 of the abelian subgroup ( the lattice of weights ) .",
    "they are given by @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "the original definition of the @xmath0kz equation is in fact the eigenvector equation for these `` scattering '' matrices ; with reasonable assumptions it is equivalent to the above system .",
    "also , note that if one defines @xmath176 , then the @xmath177 , @xmath175 generate the usual affine weyl group ( a subgroup of order @xmath2 of @xmath99 ) .",
    "the minimal degree polynomial solution of the level one @xmath0kz equation was obtained in @xcite , and is characterized by its `` base '' entry @xmath178 corresponding to the link pattern @xmath179 that connects points @xmath180 , with the value @xmath181 in which all factors are a direct consequence of the @xmath182 equations .",
    "it is then easy to prove that all the other entries of @xmath101 may be obtained from @xmath178 in a triangular way .",
    "_ example : _ at @xmath183 , there are 5 link patterns .",
    "the minimal degree polynomial solution of the level one @xmath0kz equation reads : @xmath184 performing the rational limit @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath103 yields the following multidegrees : @xmath187 and in particular the degrees @xmath188 respectively , upon taking @xmath189 and @xmath190 .      at @xmath110 , @xmath101 becomes the ground state eigenvector of the integrable transfer matrix with periodic boundary conditions and inhomogeneities @xmath191 , @xmath46 , @xmath192 , or equivalently of the scattering matrices @xmath193 .",

    "the result of @xcite is actually much more general , as the sum @xmath199 was evaluated in the presence of all the spectral parameters @xmath166 , and identified with proper normalization to the so - called izergin ",
