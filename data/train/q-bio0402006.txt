    "because of the abundant availability of mouse and human genome data ( mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 , international human genome sequencing consortium 2001 ) , it has come to light that mutation rates vary widely across different regions of the human genome ( hardison et al . 2003 , mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 , matassi et al . 1999 ) , in agreement with a number of smaller - scale studies ( wolfe et al .",
    "1989 , perry and ashworth 1999 , casane et al .",
    "regions of unusually high or low substitution rates have been observed from 4-fold sites and ancestral repeat sequences , two of the best candidates for measuring neutral rates of mutation in mammals ( hardison et al .",
    "2003 , mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 , sharp et al .",
    "the reasons for such regional variability are unclear , since structural characterizations of the mutation rate are nascent .",
    "whatever the reason for these hot and cold regions , their existence suggests a question that has intriguing consequences for molecular evolution : does the organism take advantage of these hot and cold spots ?    one way to take advantage of a hot region would be to place genes there for which the hotness is useful ",
    "an intuitive example would be receptor proteins , which must respond to a constantly changing ligand set .",
    "similarly , it could be beneficial to place delicate genes in a cold region , to reduce the possibility of deleterious mutations .",
    "these potential advantages offer the possibility that regional mutation rates affect the spatial organization of genes .",
    "the idea of such organization in mouse and human is bolstered by recent findings of gene organization in yeast .",
    "for example , pal and hurst showed that yeast genes are organized to take advantage of local recombination rates ( pal and hurst 2003 ) , which is particularly relevant since mutation rate and recombination rate are known to be correlated ( lercher and hurst 2002 ) .",
    "if the local mutation rate  equivalent to the synonymous ( amino - acid preserving ) substitution rate @xmath0 if synonymous substitutions are neutral  affects gene organization , this would constitute a type of selection complementary to traditional selection on point mutations ( graur and li 2000 ) .",
    "we studied whether local mutation rates affect gene locations by measuring the mutation rates of genes and their organization in the human genome .",
    "first , we analyzed the substitution rates of the genes in each of the families defined by the gene ontology ( gene ontology consortium 2000 ) .",
    "if the organism is taking advantage of varying @xmath0 , gene families should be biased toward regions of appropriate rate .",
    "in fact we observe that several functional classes of genes preferentially occur in hot or cold regions .",
    "some of the notable hot categories we observe are olfactory genes , cell adhesion genes , and immune response genes , while the cold categories are biased toward regulatory proteins such as those involved in transcription regulation , dna / rna binding , and protein modification .",
    "also , to better characterize the hot and cold regions , we measured the length scale over which substitution rates vary . while rough bounds on the size of hot and cold regions are known ( hardison et al .",
    "2003 , matassi et al .",
    "1999 ) , this paper presents the first quantitative calculation of their length scale .",
    "because mutation rates are regional , mutation rates in genes categories could be influenced by events altering the organization of genes in the genome , such as gene relocation or gene duplication .",
    "we therefore analyzed mechanisms by which functional categories of genes may have become concentrated in hot or cold regions .",
    "a clustering analysis reveals that the hotness of some categories is enhanced by local gene duplications in hot regions .",
    "however , there are strong functional similarities among the hot categories  both clustered and unclustered , as well as among the cold categories .",
    "these functional similarities imply that the instances of duplicated categories are not random .",
    "i.e. selection may have affected which genes have duplicated and persisted .",
    "recently , substitution rates between _ mus musculus _ and _ homo sapiens _ have been measured by several groups on a genome - wide scale ( mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 , hardison et al .",
    "2003 , kumar and subramanian 2002 ) .",
    "these substitution rates vary significantly across the genome ( mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 , hardison et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting that neutral mutation rates may have regional biases as well .",
    "a popular proxy for neutral mutation rates is the substitution rate at 4-fold sites ( a recent example is ( kumar and subramanian 2002 ) ) , base positions in coding dna which do not affect protein sequence , and which should hence be under less selective pressure than other sites .",
    "the 4-fold sites also offer the advantage of being easily alignable .    for these reasons , we estimated the neutral mutation rate from substitution rates at 4-fold sites ( which we use interchangeably with the term @xmath0 in this paper ) .",
    "this identification is not without complexities , however , since there are processes which can in principle selectively affect the 4-fold sites .",
    "for example , some have argued that exogenous factors such as isochore structure influence the silent sites ( bernardi 2000 ) , and codon usage adaptation has been shown to affect silent sites in bacteria and yeast ( sharp and li 1987 , percudani and ottonello 1999 ) .",
    "so far , such selective effects have been difficult to detect in mammals ( iida and akashi 2000 , kanaya et al .",
    "2001 , duret and mouchiroud 2000 , smith and hurst 1999a ) .",
    "recently , hardison et al showed that several functionally unrelated measures of mutation rate , including snp density , substitutions in ancestral repeats , and substitutions in 4fold sites , are correlated in genome - wide mouse - human comparisons ( hardison et al .",
    "2003 )  suggesting that these measures have common neutral aspects .",
    "we constructed our own dataset of the 4-fold substitution rates for 14790 mouse / human orthologous genes , using data from the ensembl consortium . in order to properly account for stochastic finite - size effects",
    ", we mapped the observed substitution rates to a normalized value , based on the assumption that all 4-fold sites mutate at the same rate ( see methods ) . under this assumption , it was expected that the normalized substitution rates would follow the normal distribution ( a gaussian with @xmath1 ) .",
    "contrary to these expectations , the distribution of ortholog substitution rates was found to be highly biased toward high or low rates , indicating that 4-fold mutation rates vary substantially by location , and on a scale larger than the typical size of a gene .",
    "[ fig : mutdistribution ] shows the distribution of substitution rates for all mouse / human orthologs . the observed distribution has excesses of genes at both high and low substitution rates .",
    "these results are in agreement with the findings of matassi et al ( matassi et al . 1999 ) , who reported significant mutation rate correlations between neighboring genes .",
    "this is not a compositional effect ",
    "the distribution remained the same even when corrections for the gene s human base composition were made ( see methods ) .",
    "we further verified that substitution rates of neighboring genes were correlated using an analysis qualitatively similar to matassi et al  though with approximately 20 times more orthologs  finding that gene substitution rates are correlated with their neighbors with a p - value of @xmath2 ( see methods ) .",
    "these results imply that substitution rates have regional biases acting both within a gene and over longer length scales .",
    "we next considered whether there is a relationship between gene locations and their functions .",
    "i.e. whether functional categories of genes have biases for being in regions of particular mutation rate . to test whether such biases exist , we performed an analysis of the gene ontology ( go ) assignments for each ortholog pair ( gene ontology consortium 2000 ) , using data from the ensembl human ensmart database to assign genes to go categories . for each go category",
    ", we calculated a @xmath3-score to measure the overall substitution rate , based on the substitution rates of the genes in the category ( see methods ) .",
    "the 21 go categories having statistically significant positive values of @xmath3 are shown in table [ table : gohighsub ] . in terms of 4-fold substitution rates , the hot category rate averages were found to range from 0.346 ( integral to membrane ) to 0.468 ( internalization receptor activity ) , while the genome - wide average was 0.337 ( with gene - wise standard deviation 0.08 ) . for a category with several genes ,",
    "the effective standard deviation is much smaller , equal to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of genes in the category ; so these rate biases are extremely significant .",
    "hot gene categories were focused mainly in receptor - type functions , along with a few other categories such as proteolysis and microtubule motor activity .",
    "some preferences were partially because categories have genes in common , e.g. 8 genes are shared between the categories dynein atpase activity , dynein complex and microtubule - based movement category .",
    "however , there were several categories of similar function which were independent .",
    "e.g. membrane and olfactory receptor activity shared no genes , and cell adhesion and immune response shared only 5% of their genes .",
    "overall , there was a clear bias for the larger hot categories to contain receptor - type proteins : e.g. receptor activity , olfactory receptor activity , g - protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway , membrane , and immune response . for the set of all genes where the string `` receptor '' is part of the go description , the average 4-fold substitution rate was found to be 0.347 .",
    "the probability for the set of 1488 receptor genes to have a mutation rate this high is @xmath6 .    the 36 statistically significant go categories with negative @xmath3 scores , are shown in table [ table : golowsub ] .",
    "the 4-fold rate averages for the cold categories ranged from 0.220 ( mrna binding activity ) to 0.326 ( protein serine / threonine kinase activity ) .",
    "the coldest gene categories included nuclear proteins , transcription regulation , dna and rna binding , oncogenesis , phosphatases , and kinases , all of which are important to regulatory processes .",
    "many of these genes are also housekeeping genes ( hsiao et al .",
    "for the set of all genes where the string `` regulat '' is part of the go description , the average 4-fold substitution rate was found to be 0.325 .",
    "the probability for the set of 1704 regulation genes to have a mutation rate this high is @xmath7 .",
    "we repeated our @xmath3-score classifications using several other measures of mutation rate and in each case inferred similar hot and cold categories .",
    "for example , under the normalized rate model that accounts for human base composition , the same set of 23 hot categories were found . of the 37 cold categories ,",
    "33 remained classified as cold .",
    "the 4 lost were : regulation of transcription from pol ii promoter , development , neurogenesis , and translation regulator activity .",
    "there were 6 new categories , and these were also largely regulatory : nucleic acid binding activity , translation initiation factor activity , ubiquitin c - terminal hydrolase activity , collagen , rna processing , and negative regulation of transcription .",
    "we also calculated several maximum likelihood ( ml ) measures of @xmath0 using mutation models in the paml package ( yang 1997 ) , including the nei and gojobori ( nei and gojobori 1986 ) codon - based measure and the tamura - nei ( tn93 ) and rev ( tavere 1986 ) models .",
    "we again found qualitatively similar sets of hot and cold categories  receptor genes at high substitution rates and regulatory genes at low substitution rates  though there were changes in the numbers of significant categories .",
    "for example , for the tn93 model , we observed 10 hot categories : induction of apoptosis by extracellular signals , g - protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway , olfactory receptor activity , receptor activity , apoptosis , enzyme activity , chymotrypsin activity , trypsin activity , integral to membrane , and dynein atpase activity ; and 8 cold categories : calcium - dependent protein serine / threonine phosphatase activity , ribonucleoprotein complex , protein serine / threonine kinase activity , rna binding activity , protein amino acid dephosphorylation , intracellular protein transport , protein transporter activity , and nucleus .",
    "the categories inferred from our original @xmath3-score analysis are probably more accurate than those from ml methods , because ml methods tend to produce strong outliers at high substitution rate , skewing calculations of the variance in the @xmath3-score analysis .      given the existence of hot and cold gene categories , the question then becomes : why do these biases exist ?",
    "one potentially non - selective factor that could affect category rate biases is local gene duplications .",
    "new genes generally arise by duplication , in which a new copy of a gene is generated nearby to the pre - existing gene by a recombinatorial event such as unequal crossing - over , followed by evolution to a novel , but often related function ( graur and li 2000 ) .",
    "such local duplications can cause many genes with similar function to be clustered together . because there are regional biases in mutation rate ( discussed in the section on block structure of the correlation length )",
    ", these functionally - related genes will tend to have similar mutation rates .",
    "go categories containing these genes will then be biased toward the mutation rate of the region surrounding the genes .",
    "we tested the effect of gene duplications on category rates through a clustering analysis ( see methods ) .",
    "if gene duplications are not important to category rates , genes in a hot ( cold ) gene category would be expected to be distributed randomly throughout the many hot ( cold ) regions around the genome , i.e. clustering of genes would be weak . however",
    ", if gene duplications are relevant , we would expect hot ( cold ) genes of the same category to be tightly clustered since many of these genes would have arisen by local duplications .",
    "we therefore studied the location distribution of each of the gene categories and analyzed the significance of its clustering , using the short - range correlation length @xmath8 base pairs ( see the section on block structure ) as a defining length scale .",
    "this analysis was similar to that of williams and hurst , who studied clustering of tissue - specific genes ( williams and hurst 2002 ) , though we analyzed a larger number of more narrowly defined gene families .",
    "we found that some of the hot gene categories were indeed clustered , but that none of the cold gene categories were .",
    "the results of the clustering for the hot and cold categories are displayed in tables [ table : gohighsub ] and [ table : golowsub ] , with the clustering p - values shown via their @xmath9 values .",
    "of the 21 statistically significant hot categories , 10 categories had statistically significant clustering ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "for example , the olfactory receptor activity category go:0004984 has 223 genes , with a randomly expected number of clustered genes equal to 30.6 .",
    "the actual number of clustered genes was found to be 190 , which has a p - value of less than @xmath11 . in the set of 37 cold gene",
    "go categories , none had statistically significant clustering .",
    "the clustering significance is plotted versus the substitution score @xmath3 for all the go categories with at least 5 members in fig.[fig : ratecluster5 ] .",
    "there were many categories of hot genes with significant clustering ( @xmath12 ) , but virtually no cold ones .",
    "as an example of clustering in the hot gene categories , we considered the olfactory receptors ( go:0004984 ) . it is well - established that olfactory receptors occur in clusters throughout the human genome ( rouquier et al .",
    "1998 ) , and we likewise observed the olfactory receptors to be highly clustered in three regions near the head , middle , and tail of chromosome 11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chr11clusters ] ) .",
    "the central is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr11hot ] .",
    "this clustering provided evidence that local gene duplications have influenced the high category rate of the olfactory genes .",
    "we next attempted to determine if the high olfactory rates are due to a regional bias .",
    "the substitution rates of all genes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr11hot ] , with the olfactory genes in red .",
    "as expected , the olfactory genes exhibited an obvious bias for higher substitution rates than other genes .",
    "we next calculated the mutation rate of the region as determined from an independent measure , the substitution rates between ancestral repeat sequences ( green curve ) , using data published by hardison et al ( hardison et al .",
    "2003 ) ( see methods ) .",
    "the repeat sequence mutation rate was notably higher in the regions where the olfactory genes occur , showing that the hotness of the olfactory genes is a regional property , and not specific to the genes .",
    "similar clustering and regional hotness were observed for other hot gene categories .",
    "we plot the substitution rates of a cluster of homophilic cell adhesion genes ( go:0007156 ) on chromosome 5 in fig . [",
    "fig : chr5hot ] , along with the rates of nearby genes and the ancestral repeat sequence substitution rates .",
    "the same features observed for the olfactory genes were also present for the cell adhesion genes : clustering , high substitution rates , and an elevated ancestral repeat substitution rate .",
    "the repeat substitution rate exhibited a plateau - like behavior over the region defined by the homophilic cell adhesion genes .",
    "these factors support the interpretation that significant numbers of hot genes have arisen by duplications in inherently hot regions of the genome .",
    "several explanations have been proposed that could account for the regional biases in mutation rate ( mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 ) , including recombination - associated mutagenesis ( lercher and hurst 2002 , perry and ashworth 1999 ) , strand asymmetry in mutation rates ( francino 1997 ) and inhomogeneous timing of dna replication ( wolfe et al .",
    "1989 , gu and li 1994 ) .",
    "the structure of regional biases could be considered from the perspective of amino - acid changing substitutions as well , since linked proteins have been known to have similar substitution rates ( williams and hurst 2000 , williams and hurst 2002 ) .",
    "however , the silent sites may be easier to comprehend , since protein sequences are more likely to be complicated by non - neutral pressures .    to shed light on the structural properties of the hot and cold mutational regions , we measured the length scale over which substitution rates are correlated .",
    "previously , correlations have been observed in blocks of particular physical ( @xmath13 megabases ) ( hardison et al .",
    "2003 ) or genetic ( @xmath14 centimorgans ) ( matassi et al . 1999 , lercher et al . 2001 ) size . while these studies have focused on whether correlations exist at certain length scales , it is informative to measure the decay of correlations with distance .",
    "we therefore measured the length scale of substitution rate correlation , using an analysis of the correlation function ( huang 1987 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the substitution rate of a gene @xmath17 basepairs downstream of a gene with substitution rate @xmath18 , and @xmath19 indicates an average over the available data ( see methods ) .",
    "we expect that at small @xmath17 , the correlation function will be positive and then decrease with @xmath17 as rates become decoupled .",
    "the length scale over which this decay occurs serves as a measure of the typical size of hot or cold regions .",
    "the rate correlation function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_correlation ] versus both the human and mouse values for @xmath17 .",
    "we observed two notable behaviors : 1 ) a strong correlation which decays over a region of approximately 1 megabase , and 2 ) a longer range correlation which plateaus over a region of approximately 10 megabases . at larger distances , correlations are weaker . for example , the human curve first dips below the @xmath20 threshold at approximately 11 mb and the mouse curve first crosses it at approximately 9 mb .",
    "this suggests that there are multiple phenomena which control the mutation rate of regions , both long ( 10 mb ) and short ( 1 mb ) length scale .",
    "we also measured the characteristic short - range correlation length using an exponential fit .",
    "the correlation length @xmath21 was determined by fitting the data to the functional form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the correlation at long distances and @xmath24 is the correlation at zero distance . because of the observed plateauing behavior of the data , we performed our curve fit over the region @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "for the human data we obtained @xmath26 .",
    "for the mouse data we found values of a similar magnitude ( @xmath27 ) suggesting that short range mutational processes may be alike in mouse and human .",
    "the long range correlation @xmath23 was at least an order of magnitude larger than would be expected by chance at all distances up to 10 megabases ( see methods ) .",
    "it is unclear what factors are responsible for these two length scales of rate correlation , though some guesses are possible . for the short range effect , one process that occurs on the appropriate lengthscale",
    "is dna replication ( alberts et al .",
    "replication origins in a concerted unit activate under similar timing , similar cell conditions , and could have a common regulatory mechanism , making it a reasonable to expect the dna in such a unit to have similar mutation rates .",
    "long range correlations have previously been observed at chromosomal - size distances in particular regions of the genome , e.g. it is known that chromosome 19 is generally hotter than other chromosomes ( castresana 2002 , lercher et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , the 10 megabase correlation was not simply due to selection on chromosomes .",
    "we removed the respective chromosomal average from each substitution rate and repeated the correlation analysis , finding that @xmath23 retained a significant value of @xmath28 .",
    "one possible mechanistic explanation for the long - range correlation is suggested by the finding of lercher et al that recombination rate and substitution rate are correlated even in blocks extending to 30 megabases ( lercher and hurst 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , if large regions of similar recombination rate exist , they could be related to the long - range 4-fold correlation effects we observed .",
    "recently , there has been evidence for selective factors influencing gene location in yeast ( pal and hurst 2003 ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility that similar phenomena affect gene locations in mouse / human as well .",
    "we therefore considered whether regional mutation rates could have selectively influenced the types of genes occurring in different loci in the genome .",
    "selection due to the local mutation rate would require different mechanisms than that observable through the traditional measure @xmath29 , which quantifies selection on point mutations .",
    "for example , regional mutation rates could have influenced the fitness of the genome after events that cause gene relocation , such as gene transposition or chromosomal recombination . or perhaps the duplication of certain genes provided a fitness benefit ( a mechanism possibly relevant for the hot clustered categories ) .",
    "differential duplication rates could force a category to have a mutation rate bias , due to the block structure of the mutation rate and the fact that duplications occur locally .",
    "the observed categories of hot and cold genes suggest gene locations have been selectively influenced by regional mutation rates . this is",
    "because if mutation rates were unrelated to gene function , then the lists of hot and cold categories would be expected to be random , i.e. the lists shown in tables [ table : gohighsub ] and [ table : golowsub ] would have been evenly sampled from all possible gene ontology categories . however ,",
    "this was not the case , as the hot and cold categories each had strong internal commonalities .",
    "the hot categories were found to be biased toward receptor activities or roles in extracellular communication .",
    "intriguingly , arguments based on protein - level effects appear applicable to the silent - site hotness of these categories .",
    "cellular receptors and those involved in extracellular communication are the proteins that most directly interact with the environment , and are therefore the most likely to have experienced a dynamically changing set of selection pressures",
    ". this variability of selection pressures would have made it favorable for them to be in hot regions , in order that new mutations be possible to deal with new stimuli .",
    "examples of hot categories with known protein - level diversification pressures include the olfactory receptors ( lane et al .",
    "2001 ) , immune genes ( papavasiliou and schatz 2002 ) , and cell adhesion genes ( uemura 1998 , tasic et al .",
    ".    arguments normally applied to protein - level selection were found to be appropriate for cold mutation rate categories as well .",
    "cold categories were often related to transcription or other regulatory processes .",
    "regulatory proteins should be tuned to interact with many different nucleic acid or protein targets , in contrast with receptor proteins which typically interact with only a particular ligand .",
    "mutations to regulatory proteins would therefore be expected to be more deleterious , and hence it would be beneficial for them to have low mutation rates .",
    "strong conservation pressures in the cold categories could also be related to their roles as housekeeping genes ( zhang and li 2003 ) , or as essential genes .",
    "for example , in the dataset of ( winzeler et al .",
    "1999 ) , 81 out of 356 essential yeast genes were involved in transcription , whereas only 4 were involved in signal transduction , the function most similar to extracellular communication for which data was available .",
    "the applicability of protein - level arguments to synonymous mutation rates suggests that @xmath0 and @xmath30 are under similar pressures .",
    "this is consistent with what would be expected if gene locations have evolved to make use of the block structure of the mutation rate , since relocation to a hot ( cold ) spot would increase propensities for both high ( low ) @xmath30 and @xmath0 .",
    "more quantitatively , we observed that @xmath0 category biases were similar to category biases caused by selection on amino acid changing point substitutions ",
    "i.e. selection observable through the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "we performed a gene ontology @xmath3-score analysis on @xmath29 ( for consistency , the codeml method in paml was used to calculate both @xmath30 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "there were 8 hot categories common to both the 4-fold and @xmath29 classifications ( immune response , proteolysis and peptidolysis receptor activity , integral to membrane , chymotrypsin activity , cell adhesion , trypsin activity , olfactory receptor activity ) , and 17 common cold categories ( nucleus , regulation of transcription , transcription factor activity , rna binding activity , development , ribonucleoprotein complex , ribonucleoprotein complex , protein transporter activity , protein serine / threonine kinase activity , ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity , gtp binding activity , ubiquitin - dependent protein catabolism , translation regulator activity , intracellular protein transport , neurogenesis , ubiquitin cycle , cytoplasm , regulation of transcription from pol ii promoter ) .",
    "the strong commonalities between the two types of classification suggest that the selective forces that influenced amino - acid changing point mutations also influenced gene locations .",
    "the hot and cold categories derived from @xmath29 are available in the supplementary materials .",
    "selection on gene locations would provide an evolutionary explanation for the puzzle of why @xmath30 and @xmath0 are correlated beyond levels expected by neutral evolutionary theory ( ohta and ina 1995 , mouchiroud et al .",
    "1995 ) . assuming 4-fold sites are neutral",
    ", locational selection would have to be realized through the influence of the local mutation rate @xmath0 on the amino - acid changing mutation rate @xmath30 .",
    "thus locational selection and point mutation - based amino acid selection would behave similarly with respect to positive or negative selection on protein sequence , increasing the correlation of @xmath30 and @xmath0 , even if mutations to any individual 4-fold site did not provide a fitness benefit .",
    "one caveat is that other , not necessarily exclusive , explanations for the strong correlation of @xmath30 and @xmath0 have been proposed as well  most notably simultaneous substitutions at adjacent sites , so called tandem substitutions ( smith and hurst 1999b ) .",
    "tandem substitutions were not sufficient to explain our hot and cold categories , however .",
    "we rederived sets of hot and cold categories after correcting for tandem effects ( see methods ) and once again found similar results .",
    "for example , the 6 hottest categories ( of 22 significant ) were dynein atpase activity , receptor activity , homophilic cell adhesion , olfactory receptor activity , integral to membrane , and calcium ion binding activity .",
    "the 6 coldest ( of 36 ) were nucleus , regulation of transcription dna - dependent , rna binding activity , transcription factor activity , development , and ribonucleoprotein complex .      for the hot clustered categories",
    ", it may be that high mutation rates and high rates of gene duplication are tied to a hidden variable which imposes both phenomena simultaneously .",
    "one possibility is the recombination rate along the genome , which pal and hurst found to have selective effects in yeast ( pal and hurst 2003 ) .",
    "for example , two mechanisms for diversification , gene duplication and mutation , can both be accelerated by recombination ( lercher and hurst 2002 , graur and li 2000 ) .",
    "high recombination rates are relevant for a number of the hot gene categories we have studied , as they have been suggested for the protocadherins ( wu et al .",
    "2001 ) , immune response ( papavasiliou and schatz 2002 ) , and olfactory families ( sharon et al . 1999 ) . because both gene duplication and point mutation are useful for diversifying a family , it is difficult to separate the significance of mutation rate and recombination rate .",
    "pal and hurst offered preliminary evidence that in yeast , selection acts on the recombination rate , but not point mutation rates ( pal and hurst 2003 ) .",
    "however , we have observed unusual rate biases for non - clustered gene categories as well , for which recombination would not be expected to play a role .",
    "cold gene categories are not clustered ; therefore , the existence of cold categories ( as well as non - clustered hot categories ) can not be attributed to duplication events .",
    "one alternate phenomenon that could cause cold category biases is gene relocation to cold regions .",
    "the concept of relocation brings up a number of questions .",
    "first , if cold genes have relocated , this leaves one wondering in what sort of environment cold genes originated .",
    "one speculative possibility is that these genes developed in regions of high recombination ( the hot regions ) which would have allowed for fast duplication and functional diversification , and later dispersed to cooler regions as their functions became fixed .",
    "second , it is unclear whether gene relocations occur frequently enough to account for the observed rate biases .",
    "this issue is complicated by the fact that genes have arisen at different times .",
    "many of the cold gene categories occur in diverse sets of tissues and have important regulatory effects , suggesting they should be relatively old . this old age may have allowed them enough time to redistribute through the genome .",
    "we verified the correlations of substitution rates along the genome and showed that these correlations lead to an excess of hot and cold genes , confirming studies by matassi et al ( matassi et al . 1999 ) and hardison et al ( hardison et al . 2003 ) .",
    "our results appear to disagree with those of kumar and subramanian ( kumar and subramanian 2002 ) , who reported that mutation rates are uniform in the genome . while our rate measurements were qualitatively similar to those of kumar and subramanian , one beneficial addition we made was the use of a normalized rate which accounts for the length - dependence of rate variance , allowing genes of differing lengths to be treated equally in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutdistribution ] .",
    "our correlation length analysis revealed two scales of rate correlation : a short decay length of 1 megabase and a long range length extending along a syntenous block up to distances of 10 megabases .",
    "we have very speculatively proposed that dna replication units and dna recombination may be relevant to these length scales . more generally , it is hoped that these scale determinations will be helpful in placing constraints on possible processes that control mutation rate .",
    "some data issues suggest topics for further exploration .",
    "first , the resolution of our analysis is dictated by the structure of the gene ontology , which currently has 16000 categories , but is evolving .",
    "our category inferences should become more specific as go gene assignments improve .",
    "second , multispecies data will be invaluable in revealing the mutations that have occurred in each lineage .",
    "one promising early result from human - chimpanzee comparisons , based on a set of 96 orthologs derived from hovergen release 44 ( duret et al .",
    "1994 ) , is that olfactory receptors are a hot category .",
    "unfortunately , this is the only statistically significant hot or cold category at present , due to the lack of data .",
    "however , inferences should improve rapidly as more chimpanzee gene identifications become available .",
    "we downloaded a list of the available 37347 human and 27504 mouse peptides from the ensembl sequence database ( www.ensembl.org ) , then used blast ( altschul et al . 1990 ) to find orthologous peptide sequences between the genomes .",
    "the peptides studied were the set of all known or predicted peptides in the ensembl 12.31.1 human and 12.3.1 mouse datasets .",
    "sequences were designated as orthologous if the two peptides were each other s mutual best hit in the opposing databases , as determined by blastall , and the e - value for the match was @xmath31 ( using the higher score as a worst case bound ) or better .",
    "we chose this method of ortholog determination to get a one - to - one relationship between proteins .",
    "we found 14790 ortholog pairs , a coverage rate of approximately 50% in mouse and 40 % in human .",
    "the observed e - values between orthologs have a median value of 0.0 ( @xmath32 1e-180 ) .",
    "the aligned peptide orthologs were then used in conjunction with ensembl cdna data to determine aligned orthologous cdna . for the chimp - human comparison ,",
    "human genes from ensembl were compared to chimp genes from hovergen .",
    "a mutual best hit criterion was used to determine the set of 96 orthologs .",
    "we manually inspected the mouse - human synteny of the olfactory gene cluster of fig .",
    "[ fig : chr11hot ] to verify that orthologs were assigned correctly .",
    "this was to address the concern that orthologs are more difficult to assign in gene categories with many homologous members , since incorrect assignments could distort substitution rates .",
    "the synteny structure was found to be almost totally conserved for these genes , as it was for the cell adhesion genes in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr5hot ] .",
    "we calculated the distribution of substitution rates between the mouse and human genomes using the 4fold sites of orthologous genes .",
    "4fold sites are the 3rd bases of codons for which the amino acid is specified by the first two bases . for each of the orthologous gene pairs",
    ", we calculated @xmath33 , the fraction of 4fold sites in which the mouse base differs from the human base .",
    "the average value of @xmath33 over all 4-fold sites in all orthologs was @xmath34 the average 4-fold substitution rate on a genewise basis was 0.338 with a standard deviation of 0.080 .",
    "these rates were in agreement with substitution rates measured in other studies of 4-fold sites or in ancestral repeats ( hardison et al .",
    "2003 , mouse genome sequencing consortium 2002 ) .",
    "because genes are of finite length , stochastic effects can cause substitution rates to vary from gene to gene , even if all 4-fold sites mutate at the same rate .",
    "we defined a normalized substitution rate to correct for these finite - size effects .",
    "a gene with @xmath35 4fold sites was modeled as having @xmath35 independent events in which substitution can occur with probability @xmath36 .",
    "this formulation can fit both the jukes - cantor one - parameter or the kimura two - parameter model for mutation matrices ( durbin et al .",
    "although this model is not as sophisticated as other more modern treatments ( for example , see ( tavere 1986 , tamura and nei 1993 , li 1993 , goldman and yang 1994 ) ) , it gives an easily falsifiable prediction that the rate distribution , in the absence of regional correlations , is normal , due to the central limit theorem ( rice 1995 ) .    under this model , at each @xmath35 the distribution of substitution rates",
    "can be described by a binomial distribution with standard deviation @xmath37 .",
    "therefore gene substitution rates were normalized by their respective @xmath38 to get one universal rate distribution , which in the limit of many data points should approach the normal distribution ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we defined the normalized substitution rate to be @xmath40 where @xmath33 is the actual 4fold substitution rate in the gene .",
    "the values of @xmath41 for all ortholog pairs were used to calculate the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutdistribution ] .",
    "the actual rate distribution in genes was found to be skewed toward high or low mutation rates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutdistribution ] .",
    "the observed distribution had a standard deviation of 2.04 , significantly higher than the expected @xmath1 .",
    "similar excesses of hot and cold genes were found even when corrections were made for base composition . to verify this , we calculated a normalized mutation rate using a 4-parameter model in which each site of type a , c , g , or t in the human sequence has its own substitution probability .",
    "for each human base ( a , c , g , t ) we measured the substitution rate at the corresponding 4-fold locations , yielding 4 rates @xmath42 .",
    "based on these rates , we then calculated the expected frequency and variance of substitutions for a gene given the gene s base composition at the 4-fold sites .",
    "this yielded a distribution nearly identical to that in the 1-parameter model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mutdistribution ] ) .",
    "we also tested whether neighboring genes have similar substitution rates .",
    "the orthologs were ordered by their location along the human genome , after which we calculated the pearson correlation of a gene s substitution rate @xmath41 with that of its following gene .",
    "we used only neighboring genes which were in syntenous blocks as defined by all three conditions of monotonicity ( the genes are ordered the same in both species ) , consistent strand orientation ( a block is either in the same strand orientation in both species or completely reversed ) , and consistent chromosome ( no chromosome changes in either species in a block ) , yielding a dataset of 11087 neighbor pairs . under this condition ,",
    "the pearson correlation was 0.26 , corresponding to a highly significant p - value of @xmath2 .",
    "for each go category , we calculated a normalized substitution rate ( @xmath3-score ) based on the substitution rates of all members of that category .",
    "9966 of the genes in our ortholog set had gene ontology classifications available .",
    "the @xmath3-score was defined to be @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the average substitution rate @xmath41 for the genes in the go category , @xmath45 is the average @xmath41 for all of the genes with gene ontology classifications , @xmath46 is the genewise standard deviation , and @xmath5 is the number of genes in the category . the p - value for @xmath3 was determined from the probability that a gaussian - distributed variable ( again using the central limit theorem ) takes on a value @xmath47 . to reduce the problem of outliers , we limited our analysis to the go categories containing at least 5 genes , of which there are 997 , and accordingly set a p - value cutoff of @xmath48 .",
    "we expressed the significance in terms of @xmath49 which should have a value larger than @xmath50 to be statistically significant .",
    "@xmath3-scores corrected for tandem substitutions were calculated by first removing all possible tandem substitution sites from the dataset .",
    "that is , 4-fold sites were only accepted into the dataset if both the preceding and following bases matched in the two species . after culling the dataset , we calculated rates and category @xmath3-scores as before .      to measure clustering , for each gene in a go category we tested whether it had another category member downstream of it within the short - range correlation length @xmath51 basepairs .",
    "in each go category , we calculated the number of genes satisfying this condition , defining this to be the number of `` clustered genes . ''",
    "this `` downstream '' criterion ( rather than a symmetric one ) was used to avoid the problem of double counting of genes when several are close together . to test the statistical significance of the number of clustered genes in a category",
    ", we used bootstrapping . for each go category , we performed 5000 random trials of selecting @xmath5 random genes from the entire set of orthologs , where @xmath5 is the number of genes in the go category . in each trial",
    ", we counted the number of clustered genes in this randomly selected group .",
    "the average number of clustered genes was used to approximate the random number of clustered genes by a poisson distribution .",
    "these poisson statistics were then used to calculate the significance of the number of clustered genes for the go category .",
    "a poisson distribution is appropriate as long as clustering of neighbors is a rare event , i.e. as long as @xmath52 , which was generally the case .",
    "the random distributions were visually inspected and found to agree with the shape of the poisson curve .",
    "to generate the data for tables 1 and 2 we also limited ourselves to the 997 categories with at least 5 genes , implying that @xmath10 is the cutoff for significance .",
    "aligned repeat sequences between mouse and human were obtained from the dataset of hardison et al ( hardison et al . 2003 ) . for each repeat ,",
    "positions in which a base was defined for both the mouse and human sequence were used to calculate a normalized substitution rate , in analogy with the method used for the 4-fold sites .",
    "the genome - wide average value of @xmath33 in these repeat sequences was 0.33 , which was very close to the value for 4-fold sites 0.34 .",
    "the start position of each repeat sequence was used to define its location in the genome . in order to determine the locations of repeat sequences ( based on the june 2002 ucsc genome map ) along the physical map used for the gene sequences ( based on the ensembl may 2003 map ) ,",
    "gene locations according to the two maps were compared .",
    "repeat sequence locations were then corrected using the location differences of nearby genes . for clarity , the ancestral repeat values shown in fig .  [ fig : chr11hot ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chr5hot ] were smoothed using a moving - window average of 20 repeat sequences .",
    "we considered all pairs of genes on continuous orthologous blocks , starting from the first neighbor up to the 35th gene downstream .",
    "this allowed us to get hundreds of measurements of @xmath53 for @xmath17 values even as large as several megabases .",
    "we binned these data into 100 uniformly spaced groups covering @xmath54 $ ] and then averaged over each of these bins to determine the correlation function @xmath55 .",
    "the data were plentiful enough for the averaged values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_correlation ] to be statistically significant .",
    "it was difficult to extend to larger values of @xmath17 since the amount of data decreases with @xmath17 , a fact manifested in the increasing fluctuations at larger @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_correlation ] . for example , the value of the average correlation @xmath55 at @xmath56 megabases in the human data of fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_correlation ] was based on only 79 measurements , whereas at @xmath57 it was based on 22860 measurements . for genes with alternative splicings ,",
    "only one of the genes was used , in order to avoid spurious effects caused by reuse of dna .",
    "orthologous block boundaries were defined by genes at which the chromosome changes in either species .",
    "monotonicity and consistent strand orientation were ignored in order to obtain blocks with large values of @xmath17 .",
    "most of the @xmath53 data comes from blocks at least several megabases long .",
    "approximately 5% is in blocks of size less than @xmath58 base pairs , 55% is in blocks of size between @xmath58 and @xmath59 base pairs , and the remaining 40% is in larger blocks .    the long - range correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_correlation ] was statistically significant .",
