    "jem - euso ( extreme universe space observatory ) @xcite is an observatory that will be installed on the japanese experiment module ( jem ) on the international space station ( iss ) at an altitude of approximately 400 km .",
    "the launch is planned for 2013 by h2b rocket and conveyed by the htv ( h - ii transfer vehicle ) to iss .",
    "it observes extensive air showers ( eas ) induced by ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with the energy higher than about @xmath1 ev .",
    "the super - wide field - of - view ( fov @xmath2 ) yields a circle with a 250 km radius of the observational aperture of the ground area .",
    "the targets of jem - euso are not only uhecrs but also upward neutrino events .",
    "the atmospheric volume in the fov of jem - euso is about @xmath3 tons .",
    "however , the effective area is increased by inclining the telescope from nadir ( tilted mode ) , so that the target volume for upward neutrino events exceeds @xmath4 tons . on the other hand , the threshold energy to detect eas increases too . the first half of the mission lifetime is devoted to observing the lower energy region in the nadir mode , and the second half of the mission to observing the high energy region in tilted mode .",
    "the physical conditions of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) inferred for internal shocks @xcite indicate that protons may be fermi - accelerated to energies of @xmath5 ev , making grbs potential sources of the observed uhecrs @xcite . to test this grb uhecr scenario , it is indispensable to search for uhe proton - induced signatures of secondary neutral radiation that can be observed in coincidence with grbs . although the proton - induced gamma - ray emissions , such as synchrotron emission from secondary electrons / positrons injected via photomeson interactions , have been discussed frequently @xcite , it may not be easy from photon spectra to distinguish the signature of protons from inverse compton emissions due to primary accelerated electrons .",
    "therefore , the detection of high - energy neutrinos from grbs @xcite is essential to verify the proton acceleration in grbs .",
    "many authors have estimated the cosmological neutrinos background due to grbs @xcite .",
    "the correlation between neutrino signals and grbs may verify a grb uhecr scenario .",
    "jem - euso provides us the unique chance to detect very high - energy neutrinos above @xmath6 ev , but whose background flux is probably too low to correlate each shower event with a grb .",
    "alternatively , we discuss the possibility of neutrino detection from a nearby bright grb with jem - euso .",
    "we employ the numerical code in asano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to simulate hadronic cascade processes in grbs with monte carlo techniques . while asano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) focused on the photon emissions due to accelerated protons , the numerical code automatically outputs resultant neutrino spectra .",
    "the physical processes taken into account are 1 ) photon emission processes of synchrotron and klein - nishina regime compton scattering for electrons / positrons , protons , pions , muons , and kaons , 2 ) synchrotron self - absorption for electrons / positrons , 3 ) @xmath7 pair production , 4 ) photomeson production from protons , 5 ) photopair production ( @xmath8 ) from protons , 6 ) decays of pions , muons , and kaons . for photomeson productions ,",
    "the method is the same as asano & nagataki ( 2006 ) @xcite ; we adopt experimental results for the cross sections of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , while theoretically obtained values @xcite are adopted for kaon productions via @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , or @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "more details on the treatment of meson production and their decay products can be found in asano ( 2005 ) @xcite and asano & nagataki ( 2006 ) @xcite .    both electrons and protons",
    "are assumed to be injected with power - law energy distributions as @xmath19 . in order to make a grb uhecr scenario viable ,",
    "the proton spectrum index is required to be @xmath20 , which is harder than the typical index of electrons @xmath21 obtained from grb photon spectra .",
    "although the injection spectra for the two species are expected to be the same at low energies where their gyroradii overlap , @xmath22 may be effectively realized if the proton spectrum covering 7 - 8 decades in energy deviates from a pure power - law and becomes concave .",
    "such possibilities are shortly mentioned in asano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , we adopt @xmath20 and @xmath23 in our simulations as optimistic cases .",
    "the maximum proton energy is determined by equating the acceleration timescale and cooling / dynamical timescale , taking into account synchrotron , ic , and photomeson cooling .",
    "we consider relativistically expanding shells , where all photons and particles are distributed isotropically in the shell frame and treated in the one - zone approximation .",
    "we use conventional notation @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for the energy fractions of accelerated electrons , protons and magnetic fields to the shock - dissipated internal energy .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor of electrons is chosen so that the corresponding synchrotron photon energy is always 300 kev .",
    "thus , the full set of our model parameters consists of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath27 , variability timescale @xmath28 ( or emission radius @xmath29 ) , energy of accelerated electrons in the shell @xmath30 , the energy fractions @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the plasma rest frame , we follow all physical processes mentioned above in a volume @xmath33 during a timescale @xmath34 with sufficiently short time steps .    ) with @xmath35 , @xmath36 ms , @xmath37 erg , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "fine dashed curves denote separately electron / positron synchrotron , inverse compton , and muon synchrotron components without the absorption effects.,width=288 ]    fig .",
    "[ phs ] shows the photon spectrum obtained by our simulation assuming the equipartition between protons and electrons , @xmath39 .",
    "the other parameters are denoted in the figure caption .",
    "the proton cascade processes enhance the photon energy by @xmath40% .",
    "we can clearly see the effects of @xmath7 absorption and synchrotron self - absorption around gev and 100 ev energies , respectively .",
    "the deviation from a simple power - law spectrum near the synchrotron self - absorption energy is due to the heating via self - absorption , which modifies the effective electron distribution ( the synchrotron boiler effect @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of inverse compton emission is suppressed because of the klein - nishina effect in spite of the lower value of @xmath38 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ phs ] , a significant amount of muons is produced via photomeson production . since our code outputs escaped photons and neutrinos simultaneously , the resultant neutrino spectra are consistent with obtained photon spectra , taking into account cooling of pions , muons and kaons .",
    "assuming the neutrino cross section @xmath41 , @xmath42-deacy length @xmath43 m , reflective index of air @xmath44 ( the erenkov light cone of @xmath45 ) , and density of the mantle @xmath46 , we estimate the sensitivity and threshold energy of @xmath42-neutrinos as a function of the nadir angle for jem - euso at an altitude of 400 km ( see fig .",
    "[ nut ] ) .",
    "-neutrino spectra ( bold solid curve ) for the same parameter set as fig .",
    "100 identical pulses are assumed to be emitted from a grb at 1 gpc ( the total energy of gamma - rays @xmath47 erg ) .",
    "fine solid curves denote neutrinos from decay of muons , pions , and kaons as labeled .",
    "the triangles show the threshold energy and the 99% c.l .",
    "flux sensitivity with jem - euso as a function of the nadir angle as labeled .",
    ", width=288 ]    since almost all neutrinos in the nadir direction are absorbed within the earth , it may be very difficult to detect eas due to @xmath42-decay in the nadir mode ( the nadir angle of neutrinos @xmath48 ) . as the nadir angle of neutrinos in the fov increases , the threshold energy of neutrinos gets higher , since the mean distance to eas and atmospheric absorption both increase .",
    "however , the larger nadir angle and resultant higher energy threshold lead to a larger target volume due to the longer lifetime of @xmath42 in the earth crust , which give us a effectively thicker target volume .",
    "the larger nadir angle also lead to a longer distance between tau showers and the detector which produces a larger light pool of cerenkov and effectively gives a wider target area on the earth .",
    "these two effects give us a huge effective target volume for the detection of showers induced by tau neutrinos . as a result ,",
    "the sensitivity increases with the nadir angle of neutrinos . in this estimate",
    "we have not performed detailed monte carlo simulations of development of eas etc .",
    ", which is in preparation now , so that the sensitivity curve in the figure is preliminary .    in fig .",
    "[ nut ] , we plot @xmath42-neutrino spectra , assuming that neutrino oscillation makes the fraction of tau - neutrinos 1/3 .",
    "as asano & nagataki ( 2006 ) @xcite pointed out , neutrinos from kaons dominate in the highest energy range above @xmath1 ev , because kaons , heavier than pions , do not lose so much energy before they decay into neutrinos . in the energy range of @xmath49-@xmath50 ev , the dominant component is neutrinos from @xmath51-decay , while neutrinos from @xmath52-decay is the primary component below @xmath49 ev .",
    "the maximum energies of neutrinos are determined by the balance between the cooling time and the decay time of seed particles .",
    "the obtained spectrum shows a complex shape reflecting the difference in the cooling of seed particles",
    ".    the feasible tilt angle of jem - euso may be below @xmath53 , so that a nadir angle should be @xmath54 .",
    "even for this nearby ( 1 gpc ) and bright ( total gamma - ray energy @xmath47 erg ) grb , we need @xmath55 for the nadir angle of neutrinos , though more sophisticated estimates via eas simulations may significantly improve the sensitivity .",
    "while the equipartition between protons and electrons is assumed in the former section , we should consider the possibility that grbs contain a significantly larger amount of energy in protons compared to that radiated by the accelerated electrons . from the local uhecr emissivity at proton energy @xmath56 ev , the necessary isotropic - equivalent energy per burst in accelerated protons integrated over @xmath57 ev",
    "is @xmath58 erg @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy is typically @xmath59 erg and up to @xmath47 erg .",
    "thus , in order for grbs to be viable sources of uhecrs , the latest observations point to a highly proton - dominated energy budget , @xmath60 - 100 , which is approximately independent of the actual beaming factor . in the internal shock model , shocks convert a fraction of the bulk kinetic energy of outflows into fermi - accelerated relativistic electrons .",
    "initially , however , most of the kinetic energy as well as the internal energy generated via shock dissipation are likely carried by protons , the simple 1@xmath61 order fermi acceleration theory may predict higher acceleration efficiency of protons compared to electron acceleration , because the larmor radius of shock - dissipated electrons is smaller than that of protons .",
    "but for @xmath62 . , width=288 ]     but for @xmath62 .",
    "the bold solid line is for a grb at 1 gpc , while the dashed line is for @xmath63 .",
    ", width=288 ]    as asano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite supposed , we calculate photon and neutrino spectra for proton - dominated grbs as shown in figs .",
    "[ phs - pd ] and [ nut - pd ] . in our parameter choice @xmath62",
    ", the proton - induced secondary emission totally overwhelms any primary electron component , resulting in a hard spectrum peaking at 100 mev , which is determined by @xmath7 optical depth .",
    "the dominant components are inverse compton and synchrotron emission from secondary electrons / positrons .",
    "the proton contribution enhances resultant gamma - ray energy by a factor of 5 .",
    "although the obtained photon spectrum differs from the typical grb spectra , kaneko et al .",
    "( 2008 ) @xcite reported a similar grb spectrum with a high peak energy @xmath64 mev , as well as a few other grbs with significant high - energy excess .",
    "some studies have also indicated potential observational biases against detections of high peak energies @xcite .",
    "if we adopt a larger @xmath27 , the proton cascade efficiency is diminished , which can lead to a typical shape of grb spectra . however , lower efficiency of the proton cascade weakens neutrino emission , too .    the @xmath42-neutrino spectrum for such an optimistic case is plotted in fig .",
    "[ nut - pd ]",
    ". the larger amount of protons and higher efficiency of pion production amplify the neutrino flux . as shown in fig .",
    "[ nut - pd ] , if such a nearby and bright grb with the nadir angle @xmath65 occurs inside the fov of jem - euso , eas due to @xmath42-neutrinos will be detected .",
    "for the nadir angle of @xmath66 , more distant grbs at @xmath67 can be detected .",
    "if a nearby ( @xmath68 gpc ) grb fortunately occurs , a considerable neutrino flux has been predicted by our model for the nadir angle @xmath69 .",
    "post-_swift _ estimates of the local rate of long grbs range from @xmath70 @xcite , if the grb rate is proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "therefore , we may expect a few grbs within 1 gpc per year . for a tilt angle of @xmath53 ,",
    "neutrinos from the nadir angle @xmath71 yield a very tiny solid angle in the fov .",
    "if we can take a larger tilt angle , though it may be not realistic , the solid angle for the nadir angle @xmath71-@xmath72 can be @xmath73 rad .",
    "so the detection possibility of nearby grbs may be a few percent per year in this case , though we should take into account the dead time of observation .",
    "if proton - dominated grbs at 1 gpc , which is compatible with the grb - uhecr scenario , are actual cases , neutrinos with the nadir angle @xmath65 can be detected .",
    "the solid angle of such neutrinos is @xmath73 rad in the fov for the tilted mode of @xmath53 , which implies a few percent of the grb detection possibility per year .",
    "although the above estimate of the grb rate in the fov may sound pessimistic , those finite possibilities are not negligible .",
    "the luminous neutrino flux in the proton - dominated model encourages us to detect neutrinos from grbs even at @xmath67 , which is the typical redshift of grbs ( @xmath74 events per year ) . in this optimistic scenario ,",
    "the larger volume within @xmath67 enhances the detection possibility , while we need a larger tilt angle .",
    "a more realistic sensitivity curve for upward neutrino events is now in preparation by the jem - euso collaboration .",
    "the unique capability of jem - euso provides us with an exclusive chance to detect very high - energy neutrinos from grbs .",
