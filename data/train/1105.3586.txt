    "black hole binaries ( bhbs ) , a class of the brightest galactic x - ray sources , are ideal objects to study the accretion disk physics around a black hole .",
    "they exhibit distinct `` states '' with different luminosity and spectral shape , which are mainly determined by the mass accretion rate ( see e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) . when the accretion rate is high ( but below several 10% of the eddington limit ) ,",
    "the spectra of bhbs are dominated by a soft x - ray component below 10 kev .",
    "this state is called the `` high / soft '' state , and its dominant soft component is described by a multi - color disk ( mcd ) model , formed by a superposition of blackbody radiation at different temperatures emitted from various radii of the disk @xcite . in this state , many observations suggest that the disk is extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .    in contrast , at lower accretion rates , the hard x - ray ( @xmath14 kev ) contribution to the entire flux becomes more substantial .",
    "this state , called the `` low / hard '' state , shows x - ray spectra approximated by a power law of photon index @xmath15 with a high energy cut - off at @xmath16 kev .",
    "this emission is interpreted to be produced by unsaturated compton up - scattering by hot electrons of seed photons emitted by the disk .",
    "the physical properties and geometry of the corona in relation to the disk , however , remain to be studied . while there is a consensus that an optically thick disk is truncated before reaching the isco at low mass accretion rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , discussion at what eddington fraction the disk becomes truncated is still controversial ( see below ) .",
    "radio to optical observations of bhbs have provided evidence for the presence of stable jets in the low / hard state , while the jet is quenched in the high / soft state @xcite . by using radio interferometers ,",
    "the central compact core and jet - like knots are resolved in several bhbs in the low / hard state ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the radio region , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of bhbs exhibits an almost flat profile , which is considered to be optically thick synchrotron radiation from the jets , like those observed from active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "this flat spectrum is thought to extend to the sub - mm or infrared wavelengths , above which the synchrotron emission becomes optically thin and eventually declines as a power law with an index @xmath17 ( sed units ) .",
    "thus , observations at the wavelengths where the synchrotron luminosity from the jets peaks give key information to understand the energetics of the jet .",
    "gx 3394 is a transient galactic bhb , discovered in the early 1970s @xcite .",
    "although this object was observed for many years at various wavelengths , its binary - system parameters are still uncertain ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the accretion disk geometry in the low / hard state has been studied from x - ray spectra at different luminosities .",
    "@xcite show that , at @xmath18 of the eddingtion luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , the standard disk is truncated at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the gravitational radius , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the gravitational constant , black hole mass , and light velocity , respectively . ) @xcite argue that the disk extends to @xmath25 in the bright low / hard state at @xmath26 of the eddington luminosity , based on the detection of a broad iron - k emission line .",
    "similar results are reported by @xcite at 0.023@xmath19 and 0.008@xmath27 .",
    "@xcite , however , re - analyze the same data used by @xcite , and find that the spectra are strongly affected by pile - up ( multiple photon events in ccd ) . extracting the simultaneous data that are free from pile - up , they obtain a narrower iron - k line profile that rather favors a truncated disk with an innermost radius of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the disk evolution of gx 3394 in the low / hard state as a function of luminosity is not firmly established yet .",
    "gx 3394 is also a persistent radio source in the low / hard state , whose spectrum is flat or slightly increases according to the frequency with the spectral index @xmath290.10.2 @xcite . in spite of the importance of the near - infrared data ,",
    "simultaneous multi - band observations in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath30 bands and x - rays have been very limited so far .",
    "to establish the inner disk structure of bhbs in the low / hard state , we observed gx 3394 using the x - ray satellite suzaku in 2009 march , when it became active and stayed in the low / hard state .",
    "quasi - simultaneous near - infrared observations were performed with the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) 1.4 m telescope to reveal the jet activity . in this paper",
    ", we first summarize the constraints on the system parameters of gx 3394 based on previous observations in section 2 .",
    "the suzaku observations and data reduction are described in section 3 , and analysis of the x - ray data is given in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we present details of the irsf observations and data analysis .",
    "we discuss our x - ray and near - ir results by comparing with previous observations of gx 3394 and other bhbs in section 6 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "the system parameters of gx 3394 including the distance , inclination angle , black hole mass ( hereafter @xmath31 ) , and the mass of companion star ( @xmath32 ) are still unknown .",
    "figure  [ incl_d ] summarizes the constraints derived from previous observations in the inclination ( or black hole mass ) versus distance plane .",
    "the limit that @xmath33 is less than @xmath34 is imposed by the fact that gx 3394 exhibits no eclipse @xcite .",

    "ignoring the @xmath43 term in equation  [ eq0 ] , whose value is less than 0.08 according to @xcite , we calculate the black hole mass corresponding to each inclination angle , which is indicated in the upper axis .    for a given @xmath41 value",

    "bright radio knots are observed from gx 3394 at the state transition and the head of one knot moved 12 arcsec in approximately 300 days @xcite . from this apparent velocity",
    ", we derive the relation between the inclination angle and distance , assuming the intrinsic speed of the jet to be 0.98@xmath24 @xcite or 0.92@xmath24 @xcite , a typical value observed from the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "also , recent work sets the lower limit of the companion - star mass , @xmath47 , by considering the mass transfer process of low mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",

    "the magnetic - field strength in the jet base is consistent with the @xcite result of @xmath375 g obtained for xte j1118 + 480 in the low / hard state from modelling of the multi - wavelengths sed .",
    "based on these parameters , we roughly evaluate the expected contribution of compton scattering by the non - thermal electrons , which could produce x - ray and @xmath338-ray photons from seed photons of the synchrotron radiation ( synchrotron self compton ; ssc ) and external photons ( external compton ; ec ) from the accretion disk , respectively , for a typical lorentz factor of @xmath376 .",
    "the energy density of synchrotron photons in the near infrared to optical bands is estimated as @xmath377 where @xmath378 , which depends on @xmath379 , is assumed to be @xmath380 erg s@xmath46 .",
    "similarly , that of external photons observed in the x - ray to gamma - ray bands is @xmath381 where @xmath382 erg s@xmath46 and the distance from the disk and comptonized corona to the jet base is assumed to be @xmath383 cm that corresponds to the time delay ( @xmath384 ms ) between the optical and x - ray cross correlation signals @xcite .",
    "thus , the photon energy density of these seed photons is @xmath31040 times smaller than that of the magnetic field , @xmath385 erg @xmath371 .",
    "as noticed from figure  [ sed ] , recalling that the ratio of the luminosity between synchrotron and ssc by the same electrons is proportional to @xmath386 , we estimate that the contribution of comptonized photons observed in the 1100 kev x - ray band ( ssc ) should be approximately 0.4% of the total observed luminosity , which is dominated by thermal comptonization by the hot corona .",
    "this justifies our x - ray spectral model , which ignores any non - thermal emission from the jets .",
    "the ec component , however , may contribute to the high energy emission above @xmath91 mev .",
    "similarly , we also ignore the jet synchrotron emission as seed photons for thermal comptonization by the corona in our model , because the emitting regions in the jets are assumed to be distant from the corona and disk .",
    "however , we can not rule out models where the corona and jet base are co - spatial and a comptonized component of the synchrotron photons significantly contributes to the x - ray emission , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we leave it for future work to apply self - consistent jet and corona models to the simultaneous , multi - wavelengths sed including suzaku data .    to examine the correlation between the @xmath2 and hard x - ray light curves ( figure [ lc_irx ] ) , we plot the one - day averaged 1550 kev flux ( @xmath387 ) versus @xmath2 band flux ( @xmath388 ) in figure  [ fig_flux_add ] .",
    "the data point taken from the 1981 dataset @xcite is also plotted . by fitting irsf and swift points with a power law of @xmath389",
    ", we obtain @xmath390 .",
    "this value is close to the @xcite result from gx 3394 ( @xmath391 ) , which was obtained between the @xmath1 and 39 kev bands .",
    "similar correlation is reported between the radio and x - ray fluxes with a steeper slope of 0.70.9 in the low / hard state@xcite .",
    "these correlations confirm the strong link between the jet formation and accretion flow , as directly indicated by the strong cross correlation between the optical and x - ray bands on much shorter ( @xmath392 sec ) time scale for this source .",
    "( 80mm,)f15.eps    the slope of the correlation and its dependence on the wavelength and luminosity give us important clues to understand the origin of the sed . as mentioned above , our result is not compatible with models where the near infrared emission is assumed to be an optically thick synchrotron emission .",
    "we note that , however , the thermal emission from the irradiated disk must be taken into account as well .",
    "its spectra is represented as a superposition of blackbody radiation that results in a flat sed if the conversion efficiency from the irradiated flux is constant over the whole disk @xcite .",
    "the relation between the incident luminosity ( @xmath393 ) and that of thermal emission from an irradiated outer disk ( @xmath394 ) is given by @xmath395 at frequencies corresponding to the flat part , and @xmath396 in the rayleigh - jeans region ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that a contribution from the irradiate disk in the rayleigh - jeans part could make the observed slope @xmath397 somewhat flatter than those expected from jet models . to prove the origins of the near ir emission , detailed modeling of the complete sed",
    "would be necessary , which we leave for our future investigation .",
    "we observed gx 3394 with suzaku and irsf in the low / hard state at @xmath398% of the eddingtion luminosity .",
    "the conclusions are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the broad - band suzaku spectra are well represented by a thermal comptonization by hot @xmath399 kev electrons of seed photons from the optically thick disk , with a small contribution of the direct disk component .",
    "the corona has at least two different optical depths , @xmath400 0.4 and 1 , indicating inhomogeneous structure .",
    "analysis of the iron - k line with a diskline model yields an innermost radius of @xmath401 with an estimated inclination of @xmath402 .",
    "the suzaku results indicate that the optically thick accretion disk is truncated before the isco and its inner regions are almost fully covered by the hot corona .",
    "the inferred innermost radii from the continuum fit and the iron - k line profile are consistent each other .",
    "the near infrared fluxes are correlated with that of hard x - rays by the relation @xmath403 , with variable spectral indices from 0.20 to + 0.08 .",
    "the spectrum can be explained by a sum of an optically thin synchrotron emission and a thermal emission from the x - ray irradiated outer disk .",
    "we estimate the magnetic field and size of the jet base to be @xmath12 g and @xmath404 cm , respectively .",
