    "in contrast to abstract graphs , many real networks are embedded in a metric space : the interactions between the nodes depend on their spatial distance and usually take place between nearest neighbors .",
    "examples of such networks are transportation and communication networks , friendship or contact networks@xcite .",
    "an especially important example is the internet@xcite , which is a set of routers linked by physical cables with different lengths .",
    "several recent studies have investigated networks whose nodes are embedded in a metric space , and where the probability of connecting two nodes with an edge depends on their distance @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the concept of scale - free network has emerged in the last few years as a powerful unifying paradigm in the study of complex systems of natural , technological and social origin ( see refs .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate the possibility of embedding scale - free networks in space . in particular in refs .",
    "@xcite , the general problem of embedding a scale - free network of given connectivity distribution in a euclidean lattice was studied .    in this paper",
    "we take a somewhat reversed point of view : our starting point is a spatial distribution of points on a continuous manifold @xmath1 .",
    "such points are the nodes of a network built by joining two nodes whenever their distance is less than a certain cutoff . in the following",
    "we will call ` spatial networks ' those obtained by this procedure ( sometimes also termed as ` ad hoc networks ' @xcite ) .",
    "we study how the connectivity distribution depends on the distribution of the nodes on @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that the nodes live in a continuous manifold rather than a lattice is important in generating scale - free networks since the number of neighbors that a node can have within a certain distance is not limited _ a priori _ by the lattice structure .",
    "spatial networks originating from a uniform distribution of the nodes were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that while the connectivity distribution takes the same poisson form as in the erdos - renyi random networks ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , other important features , most notably the clustering coefficient , are radically different from the erdos - renyi case .",
    "the formation of giant clusters in such networks was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a natural application of this class of networks is the study of epidemics propagation .",
    "while scale - free networks in which the connectivity does not depend on a pre - existing metric structure do not display an epidemic threshold @xcite , the situation changes when geographical closeness of two nodes influences their probability to be connected @xcite . in our networks geographical closeness _ completely determines _ whether two nodes will be connected , so that we expect to find an epidemic threshold .",
    "spatial networks appear to be a rather realistic model for epidemic propagation in animal or plant populations , where we do not expect any individual to have an interaction range very different from the average ( as is the case for highly mobile human populations ) , while we do expect the population density to be non - uniform .",
    "in addition , spatial networks of biological origin have also recently been constructed , especially from gene expression data obtained from micro - array experiments @xcite .",
    "the connectivity distribution of such networks turns out to be a truncated power - law with the exponent of the power - law decay often close to unity .",
    "interestingly , also networks constructed from gene expression data by a different rule@xcite , which does not satisfy our definition of a spatial network , display a similar connectivity distribution .",
    "these facts motivated us to study how the connectivity distribution of a spatial network depends on the distribution of the nodes in space and under which conditions a scale - free network can be obtained , and finally whether an exponent close to unity plays any special role in this context .",
    "the @xmath2 nodes of the network are supposed to be in a @xmath3-dimensional space and we will assume that they are distributed randomly in space with density @xmath4 . given a node chosen at random , the probability that it is placed within a given domain of space @xmath5 is @xmath6 ( we denote the integration measure by @xmath7 independently of the dimension @xmath3 ) .",
    "once the nodes are distributed in this space , we have to construct the edges",
    ". we will use a simple cut - off rule : given two nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , located at @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , an edge will join them if @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , once the nodes have been distributed the network is completely determined by the choice of the cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "this model follows strictly the rule used to construct networks based on gene expression data in refs .",
    "@xcite , but more generally , it can be used to model the case where the interaction has a typical scale given by @xmath16 .    denoting by @xmath17 the ball of radius @xmath16 centered in @xmath14 @xmath18 the probability that a given node is placed within @xmath17 is @xmath19    if we consider a node located at @xmath14 , the probability that it will have @xmath20 neighbors is then just the probability that @xmath20 additional nodes are located in the @xmath17 . the connectivity distribution for a node placed in @xmath14 is thus given by the binomial distribution @xmath21^{n-1-k}\\ . \\label{pkxr}\\ ] ]    in the following , we will be concerned with the limit @xmath22 : in order to obtain a well defined connectivity distribution in this limit , one has to take the limit @xmath23 , so as to ensure that the product @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the volume of the ball @xmath26 tends to a finite constant @xmath27 .",
    "this means that @xmath16 must scale as @xmath28 as @xmath22 , and implies that the expected number of nodes found within the ball @xmath17 remains finite in this limit : @xmath29 the constant @xmath27 fixes the scale of the average connectivity @xmath30 of the network . indeed , from eq.([pka ] ) derived below , it is easy to obtain the following relation between @xmath27 and @xmath30 @xmath31 let us note that although the connectivity distribution is well - defined for any value @xmath27 , it has been shown in the case of a uniform density@xcite that the existence of a giant connected component implies a minimum value of @xmath27 ( or equivalently @xmath30 ) .",
    "we will not address this problem here but we can expect that for other densities there will be some similar conditions on @xmath27 for the existence of a giant component",
    ".    in the limit @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the connectivity distribution for a node located at @xmath14 is poissonian and eq.([pkxr ] ) becomes @xmath32 for the whole space , the connectivity distribution of the network is then obtained as the spatial average of the former expression and is @xmath33 this formula solves the general problem of determining the connectivity distribution of a spatial network from the spatial distribution of the nodes . for a uniform distribution @xmath4",
    ", we recover a poissonian connectivity distribution as in ref .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ pka ] ) shows that other connectivity distributions can be obtained . in the following section we will determine under which condition a spatial node distribution generates a scale - free network instead .",
    "equation ( [ pka ] ) allows us to determine the condition that must be satisfied by the node density @xmath4 for the corresponding network to be scale - free .",
    "a network is scale - free if the moments @xmath34 of its connectivity distribution diverge for @xmath35 larger than a certain @xmath36 .",
    "it is easy to compute the moments of the connectivity distribution of a spatial network from eq .",
    "( [ pka ] ) : for integer @xmath35 we have @xmath37\\ \\ .",
    "\\label{eeq } \\end{equation } note that while all spatial networks obey this equation , the converse is not true : one can easily construct connectivity distributions $ p(k;\\alpha)$ satisfying eq.~(\\ref{eeq } ) that can not be obtained from a spatial network .     inspection of eq.~(\\ref{eeq } ) shows that the limiting case $ p(k)\\propto k^{-1}$ corresponds to a fixed point , where the connectivity distribution does not depend on $ \\alpha$.   this observation might be relevant in explaining the common appearance of scale - free networks with connectivity exponent $ \\sim 1 $ constructed as spatial networks from gene expression data \\cite{provero:2002,herrmann:2002,rho:2003}.",
    "\\section{a simple example of a scale - free spatial network }    in this section we discuss an explicit example of a one - dimensional distribution of nodes that generates a scale - free network .",
    "we calculate exactly the connectivity distribution in the limit of infinite number of nodes using eq.~(\\ref{pka } ) .",
    "we also address the issue of finite - size effects and we compare the exact result for infinite size to numerical simulation for finite networks .",
    "\\subsection{connectivity distribution for an infinite network }    we consider the space to be the open interval $ ( 0,1)$ and the node distribution to be \\begin{equation } p(x)=(1-\\beta)\\ x^{-\\beta},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\beta<1\\ \\ . \\label{node1d } \\end{equation } the information measure $ h_a$ is given by \\begin{equation } h_a=(1-\\beta)^{a+1}\\int_0 ^ 1 dx\\ , x^{-\\beta(a+1)}\\ \\ , \\end{equation } and diverges for   \\begin{equation } a\\ge\\frac{1}{\\beta}-1\\ \\ .",
    "\\end{equation } therefore we expect a scale - free network with $ \\langle k^\\nu\\rangle_\\alpha$ divergent for $ \\nu\\ge\\frac{1}{\\beta}-1$.     the connectivity distribution can be computed explicitly from eq.~(\\ref{pka } ) and is \\begin{eqnarray } \\nonumber\\\\ p(k;\\alpha)&=&\\frac{\\alpha^k}{k!}(1-\\beta)^{k+1 } \\int_0 ^ 1dx\\ , x^{-\\beta(k+1 ) } e^{-\\alpha(1-\\beta)\\ x^{-\\beta}}\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\alpha\\beta}\\left[\\alpha(1-\\beta)\\right]^{1/\\beta } \\frac{\\gamma\\left[k+1-\\frac1\\beta,\\alpha(1-\\beta)\\right]}{\\gamma(k+1)}\\ \\ , \\label{pka1d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the incomplete gamma function @xmath39 since for @xmath40 @xmath41 we have for @xmath42 @xmath43^{1/\\beta }",
    "\\frac{\\gamma\\left(k+1-\\frac1\\beta\\right)}{\\gamma(k+1 ) } \\label{exact}\\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{1}{\\alpha\\beta}\\left[\\alpha(1-\\beta)\\right]^{1/\\beta } k^{-1/\\beta}\\ \\ . \\label{scalefree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result shows explicitly that scale - free networks with any value of the connectivity exponent down to 1 can indeed be obtained as a spatial networks , as it is observed in gene expression networks .",
    "finally , we remark that the transition to a power - law behavior of the connectivity distribution ( [ exact ] ) depends on @xmath27 and @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , when the second argument @xmath45 of the incomplete gamma function tends to zero , we have a power - law behavior for @xmath46 even at small @xmath20 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ figure1 ] ) .      since real spatial networks contain a finite number of nodes and our analytical results were obtained in the limit of infinite networks , it is important to address the issue of finite size effects . in this section ,",
    "we approach the problem from a numerical point of view by constructing finite spatial networks by monte carlo methods and comparing their connectivity distribution with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the figure @xmath47 shows the result of such comparison for the one - dimensional spatial networks studied in the previous subsection , at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . for a finite network , @xmath27",
    "is naturally defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes and @xmath16 is the distance cutoff used to define links . in each part of the figure ,",
    "the connectivity distributions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 points are superimposed to the theoretical distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ pka1d ] ) .",
    "we can conclude that already for moderately sized networks the connectivity distribution is very close to the @xmath22 behavior eq .",
    "( [ pka1d ] ) , thus indicating that our results provide a good approximation to the connectivity distribution of finite spatial networks .",
    "we have presented a systematic analysis of the connectivity distribution of spatial networks constructed by joining nodes closer to each other than a cutoff distance , in the limit in which the number of nodes tends to infinity .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the connectivity distribution can be expressed as a functional of the spatial distribution of the nodes , eq .",
    "( [ pka ] ) .",
    "the moments of the connectivity distribution are related to a certain measure of information @xmath54 of the node distribution through eq .",
    "( [ moments ] ) . in particular ,",
    "scale - free networks arise from this construction whenever the information measure @xmath54 diverges for some @xmath55 and we showed that scale - free networks with any exponent @xmath56 can be constructed as spatial networks .",
    "our results were obtained in the limit of infinite number @xmath2 of nodes but numerical results suggest that they provide an excellent approximation of real , finite spatial networks already for moderate @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the analysis of the dependence of the connectivity distribution @xmath46 on the connectivity scale @xmath27 suggests that the limiting case @xmath0 corresponds to a fixed point , a fact that might be related to the empirical observation that several spatial networks constructed from gene expression data show a scale - free connectivity distribution with exponent close to 1 .",
    "intuition suggests that spatial networks will be _ highly clustered _ and _ highly assortative_. the clustering coefficient of spatial networks was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for a uniform node distribution : however since the clustering coefficient is a local quantity and does not depend on the spatial density of nodes , the results of @xcite should hold unchanged for all spatial networks , as long as the node distribution is isotropic in space .",
    "moreover , spatial networks can be expected to display a high degree of assortativity , since high connectivity nodes are placed in high density regions and are therefore more likely to be connected to other high connectivity nodes .",
    "indeed empirical spatial networks constructed from gene expression data show a high degree assortativity @xcite .",
    "a closely related issue is the determination of the diameter of spatial networks . due to the embedding in a metric space",
    ", we expect the diameter to grow as a power of the number of nodes , and therefore we do not expect spatial networks to belong to the small - world networks class .    perhaps the most interesting open problem is to clarify the role of the limit case @xmath0 , namely to classify the node distributions that flow to this fixed point in some limit .",
    "an example is given by eq.([pka1d ] ) in the @xmath57 limit .",
    "@xmath0 implies that the measure of information @xmath54 diverges for all @xmath55 , which in turn implies that the node distribution must become degenerate ( that is its support must shrink to zero measure ) .",
    "however this is not a sufficient condition , since for example a gaussian @xmath4 in the limit of zero variance , while becoming degenerate , does not flow to @xmath0 ."
