    "during the last two decades the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , the effect of photon creation in an empty nonstationary cavity @xcite , attracted considerable attention in literature .",
    "being a firm prediction of quantum field theory , the dce has not been observed yet experimentally .",
    "this is probably the main reason for such interest to it , and therefore search for a realistic scheme for experimental observation of the dce is an actual problem of modern quantum electrodynamics .",
    "a nonstationary cavity can be realized by two possible ways : ( i ) a cavity with moving boundaries , or ( ii ) a cavity with fixed shape but with _ varying _ boundary conditions . in case ( i )",
    "a significant number of photons could be created if the velocity of boundaries is close to the speed of light .",
    "the corresponding experimental realization would be obviously a difficult technical problem .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested to utilize the vibrating cavity and accumulate the effect by tuning the frequency of small mechanical oscillations of the boundaries ( which could be induced , e.g. , by a sound wave @xcite , or due to piezoelectric effect @xcite ) in resonance with an eigenfrequency of the cavity @xcite , see also the recent review @xcite . in this realization ,",
    "an extremely high accuracy of frequency tuning must be provided .",
    "owing to amazing progress in modern laser technology and semiconductor electronics , the variant ( ii ) could be considered as a more realistic one @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of a semiconductor film located on a dielectric base can be changed , e.g. , by means of electron - hole plasma creation by a strong femtosecond laser pulse @xcite , or due to injection of carriers by a powerful electric pulse @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "variation of optical properties of the boundary can be fast enough and well controlled .",
    "however , theoretical investigation of the first variant is simpler from mathematical point of view , at least in the framework of a one - dimensional model . sometimes in the framework of the first approach exact solutions to the problem",
    "can be found for some special laws of motion . besides",
    ", one may hope that very fast displacement of a boundary acts like `` almost instant '' creation of a new boundary due to changing of optical properties of the medium inside the cavity . therefore we will consider a cavity with moving boundaries in this paper , and",
    "will be especially interested in the case of ultrarelativistic motion .",
    "we will present a new exact solution for the dce problem in a one - dimensional ideal cavity uniformly contracting during the time interval @xmath0 and otherwise stationary .",
    "a complete set of solutions for a classical field inside a one- or even three - dimensional cavity at the time of uniform contracting was known for years , see ref .",
    "it was used , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , for calculation of the casimir force acting between the boundaries of a relativistically squeezing or expanding cavity .",
    "in contrast , our solution for a one - dimensional quantum field in a uniformly contracting cavity seems to be unknown in literature , and allows one to study the dce for this particular case non - perturbativly .",
    "we have discovered a new and unexpected effect of periodic dependence of the number of created particles on some variable @xmath1 determined by the time of contracting @xmath2 and velocity of the boundary @xmath3 .",
    "it is explained by quantum interference of the events of particle creation which are taking place only at the moments of acceleration ( @xmath4 ) and deceleration ( @xmath5 ) of a boundary , while stable particle states exist ( and thus no particles are created ) at the time of contracting .",
    "we review the hamiltonian approach in section [ hamiltonian preliminaries ] .",
    "consideration of a field quantization procedure in a uniformly contracting cavity is presented in section [ quasiparticles ] .",
    "section [ particle creation ] is devoted to calculation of the energy spectrum of particles created in the cavity .",
    "the periodic dependence of all measurable quantities on @xmath1 is indicated , and the optimal conditions for the dce are derived .",
    "the discussion of the results and conclusions are given in section [ discussion ] .",

    "we begin with derivation of hamiltonian for a one - dimensional problem based on the well known properties of time - dependent canonical transformations in classical hamiltonian mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "for the case of a uniformly contracting cavity @xmath35 where @xmath36 is duration of contracting and @xmath37 is the velocity of the moving boundary , we obtain at @xmath0 @xmath38 the same result follows from the general law formula ( 2.21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the `` effective '' hamiltonian which was constructed to reduce the equations of motion for operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 to the heisenberg form .",
    "this proves that both approaches are equivalent at least for the case when the hamiltonian is quadratic in structure .    the additional terms in ( [ lambda ] )",
    "are responsible for annihilation and creation of pairs and scattering of particles from one mode to another in the contracting cavity .",
    "the corresponding `` coupling constants '' are proportional to the velocity of the moving boundary and are small in non - relativistic case .",
    "one can see that the terms of the hamiltonian ( [ lambda ] ) responsible for interaction between modes are of the same order as those describing particle production in a separate mode .",

    "its time dependence is determined exclusively by a c - number factor @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the operator @xmath41 does not depend on time explicitly and is an integral of motion .",
    "therefore , being quadratic in canonical variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 , it admits diagonalization by a time independent linear canonical transformation ( bogolubov transformation ) from @xmath19 , @xmath20 to some new canonical variables @xmath42 , @xmath43 . in terms of these new variables",

    "( [ delta ] ) is equivalent to two relations @xmath213 where @xmath214 . in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) the conditions ( [ cond ] )",
    "take on form of eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) with @xmath217 .",
    "our analysis shows that physically the conditions ( [ res ] ) mean that maxima of @xmath218 appear in the cases when the first cluster is located at a distance equal to an odd number of half - waves @xmath219 from the point of creation of the second cluster .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that kinematics of our problem permits implementation of this condition only in the ultrarelativistic case .",
    "therefore the less is the speed of the boundary @xmath3 , the less pronounced are the maxima and @xmath220 in minima , compare fig .",
    "[ n(q)plot ] .",
    "the values of @xmath221 in the points of maxima are given by eq .",
    "( [ nnexuni2 ] ) with logarithmic accuracy , and thus can not reproduce numerical results just as well as their positions .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ nnexuni2 ] )",
    "reproduces the main features of spectra nearby the maxima qualitatively correctly .",
    "it is important that the height of the maxima grows as @xmath222 , or equivalently , as @xmath223 in the ultrarelativistic limit due to strong interactions between the modes .",
    "clearly , the effect of dce amplification arises due to constructive interference of events of particle creation at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "for example , if @xmath224 , then for certain values of @xmath153 ( or @xmath2 ) in the mean more than one particle in the principle mode ( or a little bit less than one particle in the first excited mode ) can be created .",
    "an exact solution to the problem of dynamical casimir effect in a one - dimensional uniformly contracting cavity was found .",
    "this became possible due to existence of stable non - interacting particle states in such a cavity .",
    "as a consequence , we succeeded in diagonalization of the hamiltonian for a many - mode quantum field in a cavity with uniformly moving boundaries ( a generalization to the case with both boundaries moving uniformly is straightforward , but rather cumbersome ) .",
    "the developed method opens us possibilities to solve exactly many other one - dimensional dce problems for cavities with boundaries moving along polygon - like world lines , including the interesting case of vibrating boundaries .",
    "a new representation for the field hamiltonian was proposed in one - dimensional problem .",
    "it was demonstrated explicitly that particle creation as well , as mode - to - mode interaction is absent in a nonstationary cavity if its boundaries are moving uniformly .",
    "however , the same approach can not be applied to physically more realistic three - dimensional problem , although a complete set of classical solutions generalizing eq .",
    "( [ milne_modesxt ] ) is known for this case as well @xcite .",
    "this is due to breakdown of stability of particle states and presence of interactions between them in three - dimensional problem .",
    "it was shown that the number of particles , created in each mode , depends periodically on the logarithm of the squeezing rate of the cavity @xmath153 , which is equal to the ratio of the final and initial sizes of the cavity and is related to duration of contracting in a rather simple way .",
    "this dependence is not monotonous . for the given velocity of the moving boundary",
    ", there exists an infinite sequence of values @xmath225 for which particles are not produced . on the other hand",
    ", it is possible to specify an infinite set of combinations of parameters , which correspond to an optimal regime of particle production .",
    "theoretically , at sufficiently large lorentz factor @xmath161 for the moving boundary , the number of created particles can be done arbitrary large .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the mentioned values of lorentz factors are indeed very large .",
    "for example , the value @xmath226 for production of a single particle is necessary . we should also mention that the number of created particles in the case of a cavity with ultrarelativistic boundaries depends on @xmath161 rather slowly ( proportional to @xmath223 ) .",
    "the non - monotonous character of dependence of the number of created particles on @xmath153 is also present in the framework of an oversimplified `` one - mode '' model .",
    "however , correct estimations , especially near the maxima of particle production rate , and even correct qualitative understanding require taking into account mode - to - mode interactions .",
    "this is true in principle at consideration of any non - perturbative feature of dce .",
    "therefore , it is very important to consider exactly soluble models .",
    "it should be noticed , that the approximation of uniform motion of the boundaries , separated by moments of instant infinite accelerations , does not work well for high - frequency modes .",
    "for example , the energy spectrum ( [ nn ] ) has an inadmissibly slowly decreasing tail ( @xmath227 ) leading to an infinite total number of created particles .",
    "these problems can be resolved by smoothing instant infinite accelerations , but the corresponding problem ceases be exactly soluble .",
