    "due to their physical and chemical characteristics , selenium - based alloys are very important from technological and scientific points of view , mainly those alloys containing germanium or zinc because of their very interesting optical properties . for example , zinc selenide ( znse ) is used in infrared lenses field .",
    "more recently , researches on semiconductor quantum dots have shown that it can also be used in short - wavelength visible - light laser devices @xcite . according to them",
    ", the use of znse in this field needs that the alloy is synthesized in nanometer form , with crystallite sizes smaller than the znse exciton bohr diameter ( @xmath0  ) . for this purpose ,",
    "techniques such as arrested nucleation in glasses , precipitation from sol - gel solutions and entrapment in porous sites inside zeolite cavities have been employed .",
    "these techniques , beyond expensive , are not able to full control the size of the nanoparticles obtained .",
    "mechanical alloying ( ma ) @xcite has been used for almost two decades to produce many unique materials .",
    "these include , for instance , nanostructured alloys , amorphous compounds and unstable and metastable phases @xcite .",
    "this method has several intrinsic advantages , like low temperature processing , easy control of composition , relatively inexpensive equipment , and the possibility of scaling up .",
    "although the ma technique is relatively simple , the physical mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood . in order to make use of this technique in industrial applications ,",
    "a better understanding of these physical mechanisms is desirable .    from a structural point of view",
    ", nanostructured materials can be regarded as being made of two components , one crystalline , with dimensions of the order of some nanometers , that preserves the structure of bulk crystal , and one interfacial , composed by defect centers .",
    "this component has caused controversy in the literature .",
    "gleiter @xcite has described it based on a gaseous model while other authors @xcite disagree .",
    "the number of atoms in both components is similar @xcite . due to this fact , nanostructured material properties are strongly dependent of the interfacial component . from a technological point of view",
    ", manipulation of the interfacial component makes it possible to design materials with desired physical properties for specific applications @xcite .",
    "the zn - se phase diagram @xcite shows only an equiatomic znse phase . in a recent paper @xcite de",
    "lima _ et al_. reported structural results obtained from the application of ma to zn@xmath1se@xmath2 ( @xmath3 , 0.30 , 0.40 , 0.50 , 0.70 at .",
    "% ) mixtures .",
    "the measured x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns for the mixtures with nominal compositions different of the equiatomic one showed the peaks associated to the znse phase and those ones associated to the majority component . in the case of se - rich mixtures , se excess was found in amorphous state .",
    "more recently , in other paper @xcite , de lima _ et al_. reported results on the influence of aging in the structural properties of the amorphous selenium ( _ a_-se ) produced by ball milling ( bm ) .",
    "they have observed that the atomic structure of _",
    "a_-se produced by bm , which is formed by se@xmath4 chains , has transformed partially to another known _",
    "a_-se structure formed by se@xmath5 rings found in the amorphous state obtained by rapid quenching or vapor deposition methods . based on this interesting observation , an aged nanostructured znse sample produced by ma",
    "some years ago was re - examined by using xrd and dsc techniques .",
    "to our knowledge , it is the first time that such study is reported .",
    "a nanostructured equiatomic znse sample ( hereafter called znse-97 ) was prepared by ma in 1997 following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite . the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) pattern measured after milling was indexed to the cubic zinc selenide phase ( isostructural with the structure of zns compound ) , with lattice parameter @xmath6  . after four years being kept in a dry desiccator a new xrd pattern of the same sample ( hereafter called aged - znse-97 ) was measured in order to verify possible structural changes .",
    "the comparison between the xrd patterns of the as - milled and aged samples shows significant differences that will be discussed later . to ensure reproductibility of the znse-97 ,",
    "a new equiatomic znse sample was prepared by ma .",
    "its xrd pattern was identical to that recorded for the as - milled znse-97 sample .",
    "small quantities of the aged - znse-97 sample were heat treated at 196@xmath7c and 350@xmath7c in quartz capsules containing argon . only the sample heated at 350@xmath7c",
    "was quenched .",
    "the other was air - cooled . during the heat treatment at 350@xmath7c , formation of water drops at the inner walls of the capsule was observed , indicating that the samples are hydrophilic .",
    "all heated samples were analyzed using a rigaku powder diffractometer , miniflex model , with cu k@xmath8 radiation ( @xmath9  ) and a ta 2010 differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) cell with a heating rate of 10@xmath7c / min in a flowing argon atmosphere .",
    "the measured xrd patterns for znse-97 , aged - znse-97 and crystalline selenium in its trigonal form ( _ c_-se ) are shown in figs . [ fig1].a , [ fig1].b and [ fig1].c , respectively . in a previous study @xcite we showed that the xrd pattern seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1].a corresponds to the nanostructured znse compound . a comparison between figs . [ fig1].a and",
    "[ fig1].b shows that this phase is also seen in the aged - znse-97 sample .",
    "this indicates that the znse phase is as stable with aging as expected .",

    "1 - 1136 @xcite .",
    "their low intensities when compared to those associated with the znse phase suggested that this contaminant should be found in a small quantity , and a rietveld analysis @xcite ( discussed below ) confirmed this assumption .",

    "the results obtained show that the lattice parameter of the znse phase changes with aging within 0.1% and their values are listed in table [ tab1 ] . besides that , about 93% of the crystalline phases",
    "are given by the znse phase and 7% by the zno phase in the as - milled sample , whereas in the aged sample the znse , zno and _ c_-se phases are responsible for about 73% , 16% and 11% of the phases , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . by using the full width of half maximum ( fwhm ) obtained from the simulated patterns and",
    "the scherrer formula @xcite the average crystallite sizes of the phases were estimated .",
    "the results for the znse phase are found in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "its value for the zno phase is 129   in the as - milled and 135   in the aged samples . in the aged sample ,",
    "c_-se phase has an average crystallite size of 335  , indicating that all phases are found in the nanometric form . as mentioned above , nanostructured alloys are described by two components , one crystalline and other interfacial .",
    "thus , the segregation of the _ c_-se particles in the aged sample could have had its origin in the migration of se atoms located at the interfacial component and , if this is true , it is a remarkable fact since the _",
    "c_-se segregation process has occurred at room temperature . according to gleiter @xcite , the interfacial component is formed by a high density of interfaces ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) , which gives raise to a high density of short diffusion paths . as a consequence of the presence of an interfacial component in the nanostructured material",
    ", it is expected an increase in the diffusion coefficient in comparison with single crystals and polycrystals with the same chemical composition .",
    "for instance , according to birringer _",
    "et al_. @xcite , the self - diffusivity in nanocrystalline copper ( 80  ) at 353 k is @xmath12 m@xmath13/s while in the lattice its value is @xmath14 m@xmath13/s .",

    "the increase in the intensity of the peaks in the aged - znse-97 dsc spectrum is due to the quantity of water adsorbed during aging .",
    "the exothermic peak about 130@xmath7c and the endothermic one at 200@xmath7c ( see fig . [",

    "the crystallinity of the znse phase is significantly improved only at 350@xmath7c , as indicated by its xrd pattern ( see fig . [ fig4].b ) and by its lattice parameter given in table [ tab1 ] . as expected",

    "in addition , rietveld analysis indicates that the znse and zno phases correspond to about 84% and 16% of the crystalline phases found in this sample , respectively .",
