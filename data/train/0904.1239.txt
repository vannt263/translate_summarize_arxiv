    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods provide an important methodology for solving for the properties of interacting fermi systems . in auxiliary field techniques",
    "@xcite , the partition function , @xmath1 $ ] is expressed as a path integral , for example , by discretizing the imaginary time @xmath0 into @xmath2 intervals of length @xmath3 , and separating the one body ( kinetic ) and two - body ( interaction ) terms .",
    "the latter are then decoupled through the introduction of a hirsch - hubbard - stratonovich ( hhs ) field  @xcite which reduces the problem to a quadratic form .",
    "the fermion degrees of freedom can be integrated out analytically , leaving an expression for the partition function which is a sum over the possible configurations of the auxiliary field . for interacting lattice hamiltonians , such as the hubbard model ,",
    "this field depends both upon the spatial site and on the imaginary time coordinate .",
    "the sum over configurations is performed stochastically , for example , by suggesting local changes and accepting or rejecting with the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the problem is challenging numerically because the summand is the determinant of a product of matrices , one for each fermion species .",
    "the determinant is costly to evaluate , and can also become negative at low temperatures , which constitutes the fermion sign problem  @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to represent the matrices . in the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) approach @xcite ,",
    "the matrices have dimension equal to the number of spatial lattice sites @xmath4 .",
    "the matrices are dense , and involve the product of @xmath2 sparse matrices .",
    "the algorithm scaling , @xmath5 , arises from the need to update @xmath6 field variables at a cost of @xmath7 per update , where advantage is taken of an identity for the inverse and determinants of @xmath4-dimensional matrices which differ only by a rank - one change .",
    "simulations with this method can now be done on many hundreds of spatial sites . in situations where particle - hole symmetry prevents a sign problem ,",
    "for example , the half - filled hubbard hamiltonian , one can reach arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "dqmc simulations have proven the existence of long - range antiferromagnetic order in the two - dimensional half - filled hubbard model  @xcite , as well as accurately determined the nature of the spectral function and thermodynamic properties at this density  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the algorithm developed by hirsch and fye ( hf )  @xcite for embedded - cluster problems , a larger , sparse matrix of dimension @xmath6 is considered .",
    "the advantage of the hf - qmc approach is that the matrices are better conditioned ( no product of @xmath2 matrices is involved ) and also they remain positive to much lower temperatures ; the sign problem is far less severe in the hf - qmc method .",
    "however , because determinants of larger matrices are involved , the hf - qmc algorithm scales as @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , hf - qmc has seen its most powerful applications within dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite and its cluster extensions , the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite , and the cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft )  @xcite for which @xmath4 is typically small . in effect",
    ", dmft trades the large lattice sizes @xmath4 , and @xmath9 scaling of dqmc where spatial correlations can be explored , for the ability to reach much lower temperatures at general fillings at the cost of less real - space information , apart from that obtained from the mean field .",
    "dmft also can directly access phase transitions which can only be inferred from finite - size scaling in dqmc .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a hybrid approach which combines some of the virtues of both dqmc and hf - qmc .",
    "the key algorithmic improvement is a reduction in the @xmath10 hf - qmc scaling to linear in @xmath2 .",
    "the importance is that this allows much larger @xmath4 to be considered . at the same time",
    ", we demonstrate analytically ( and confirm numerically ) that the fermion sign problem in our hybrid algorithm is precisely the same as in hf - qmc , provided that the coupling to the host is fully taken into account .",
    "thus , as in hf - qmc , we can reach low temperatures at quite general fillings .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the basic formalism , including a proof that the sign problem is unchanged from hf - qmc .",
    "we then show results for various physical observables including the quasi - particle weight , local moment , and the green s function .",
    "we demonstrate that the results of our algorithm converge to the same values as that of a well - developed and tested hf - qmc code .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of the scaling properties of our new approach .",
    "dmft , dca , and other cluster extensions such as the cdmft all map the lattice problem onto an effective cluster embedded in a self - consistently determined effective medium . here",
    ", we will add additional sites to the cluster to emulate the effective medium  @xcite .",
    "the associated formalism will be sketched for the dmft and dca , but it is easily extendable to include cdmft .",
    "the dca is a cluster mean - field theory which maps the original @xmath11dimensional lattice model onto a periodic cluster of size @xmath12 embedded in a self - consistent host .",
    "this mapping is accomplished by replacing the green s function and interaction used to calculate irreducible quantities such as the self - energy ( @xmath13 ) by their coarse - grained analogs .",
    "spatial correlations up to a range @xmath14 are treated explicitly , while those at longer length scales are described at the mean - field level . for details of the dca formalism and algorithm",
    ", please see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dca loop converges when the cluster green s function equals the coarse - grained green s function , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 labels a cluster wave number , @xmath18 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath19 labels the lattice wave numbers in the wigner - seitz cell surrounding @xmath17 , and @xmath20 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "@xmath21 is the coarse - grained dispersion and @xmath22 is the single - particle hybridization between the dca cluster and its effective medium .    here",
    ", we consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) single - band hubbard model  . in order to employ dqmc as a cluster solver",
    ", we define an effective cluster hamiltonian to preserve the coarse - grained green s function through the addition of host band degrees of freedom , which we label with @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 the host band label , @xmath25 , runs from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the dispersion for the @xmath23 band , @xmath29 is the coupling of the @xmath23 band to the @xmath30 band , @xmath31 is the strength of the interaction and @xmath32 is the number of spin-@xmath33 electrons on site @xmath34 . upon integration of the @xmath35band degrees of freedom ,",
    "the correlated band green s function becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath28 are adjusted to fit the dca or dmft hybridization function @xmath38 . for this , we use marquardt s method  @xcite to minimize the following merit function at each momentum point : @xmath39 we define the scaled deviation as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the standard deviation of data .",
    "the discretization of the bath degrees of freedom has been considered in dmft where exact diagonalization ( ed ) is used as the hamiltonian - based impurity solver  @xcite .",
    "extensions of this method to dynamical cluster mean - field theories have also been largely implemented to study variety of models such as the extended hubbard or multiband models  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that since ed is essentially exact , there is no systematic error beyond the discretization of the bath .",
    "moreover , more complicated interactions than just the onsite coulomb can be easily included in the hamiltonian . however , the disadvantage of ed is that the hilbert space grows exponentially with the total size of the system , @xmath42 .",
    "this greatly limits the size of the clusters that can be studied .",
    "this is specially true since ( as we discuss below ) smaller clusters generally require a higher number of non - interacting bands to fully account for the coupling to the bath , and for larger clusters , e.g. , the 16-site cluster , even a very small @xmath43 will make ed inapplicable .",
    "the average sign in the dqmc method is equivalent to the average sign in the hf - qmc method in the limit of infinite number of bath bands , @xmath44 . to prove this",

    "@xmath68 $ ] is used as the sampling weight to complete the sum over the auxiliary field .",
    "note that the action is off - diagonal in time , except for the first term of the non - interacting action which is equal to one along the diagonal [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : s0 ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 is an off - diagonal sparse matrix with identity matrices along the diagonal and its determinant can be evaluated from a smaller matrix of size @xmath70 , using the following identity : @xmath71=\\det[i+b_{\\sigma , l}b_{\\sigma , l-1}\\dots b_{\\sigma,2 } b_{\\sigma,1}]\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the corresponding off - diagonal sub - matrix of @xmath69 at time slice @xmath58 .",
    "the dqmc markov process proceeds by proposing changes in the hhs fields which are local in space and time , @xmath73 .",
    "because of that , the ratio of the fermion determinants can be calculated directly from just the diagonal entry of the green s function .",

    "ctqmc eliminates the systematic error inherent in hf - qmc and dqmc , including the method presented here , by stochastically sampling the reducible feynman graphs of the partition function .",

    "<S> we present here a new method based on determinant quantum monte carlo which scales linearly in @xmath0 , with a quadratic term that comes in to play for the number of time slices larger than hundred , and demonstrate that the sign problem is identical to hf . </S>"
