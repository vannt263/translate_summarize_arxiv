    "the simplest approach to the many - body system is the mean  field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "the most powerful mfa is the hartree  fock ",
    "bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory , where particle - hole and particle - particle correlations are taken into account at the same foot .",
    "the success of this simple approach is based on the large variational hilbert space generated by symmetry breaking wave functions . for an atomic nucleus and in the most general hfb approach as many symmetries as possible , in particular the rotational invariance and the particle number symmetries are broken . in these approaches",
    "the quantum numbers are only conserved on the average , a semiclassical approach to the full quantum requirement to the wave function of being an eigenstate of the symmetry operators .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the plain hfb approach works well in the case of a strongly correlated regime and with a large number of nucleons participating in the symmetry breaking process . in the case of the rotational invariance , the ideal situation",
    "is represented by a strongly deformed heavy nucleus where a large number of nucleons contribute to the collective phenomenon of deformation . in the case of the particle number symmetry ,",
    "in which we are interested in this paper , the situation is far from being satisfactory because only a few pairs of nucleons ( four to five ) in the vicinity of the fermi surface are thought to cause the phenomenon of nuclear superfluidity .",
    "thus , it is well known that the treatment of pairing correlations in the mean field approach produces an unrealistic transition from the superfluid to the normal phase along the yrast band , not expected in a finite system . in order to get an improved description of the nucleus",
    "it is clear that one has to go beyond the mean field approximation to include correlations .",
    "this task can be achieved in a simple and effective way within the particle number projection ( pnp ) @xcite formalism , another possibility is to build correlations by the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is , however , from the applications point of view , very limited , since the required calculation of the ground state correlations can be performed only for very simple models and/or separable interactions .",
    "concerning this point one has to keep in mind that not only the rpa but also other sophisticated theories have been developed only in simple models or with separable forces .",
    "thus the first calculation with exact particle number projection before the variation was done about twenty years ago @xcite with the pairing plus quadrupole hamiltonian and the baranger - kumar configuration space .    in the last years in an attempt to achieve some progress in calculations with effective forces and large configuration spaces , the lipkin nogami method @xcite has experienced a revival .",
    "the great advantage of the lipkin nogami method is that corrects , in an approximate way , for the zero point energy associated with the breakdown of the particle number symmetry at the _ mean field level _ , i.e. the calculations do not get much involved as compared to the full hfb ones .",
    "some applications of this method with effective forces have been done with the skyrme force @xcite , the gogny force@xcite and the relativistic mean field approach @xcite .",
    "the lipkin nogami method on the other hand is just a recipe and can not be obtained from a variational principle .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop an exact particle number projection which can be applied to effective forces .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop an exact particle number projection before ( and after ) the variation for density dependent forces and in particular for the gogny force .",
    "as we shall see , the exchange terms play an important role in pnp , in fact the neglection of any exchange term may lead to divergences .",
    "as it is well known , in general , a zero range force is unable to provide good pairing properties . as a matter of fact ,",
    "normally the pairing terms of the force are neglected in order to get reasonable hartree fock results . to perform hfb calculations",
    "a pairing force has been usually added ad hoc .",
    "the finite range of the density dependent gogny force , on the other hand , provides good pairing properties without neglection of any exchange term .",
    "in fact , the force was designed with this intention@xcite and this property makes the gogny force one of the few effective density dependent forces for which particle number projection is feasible without problem due to divergences .",
    "all the skyrme parametrizations ( with the few exceptions of those which provide reasonable pairing correlations ) and all relativistic mean field approaches may give in general divergent contributions to the projected energy .    in section  [ sec : gpt ] , we introduce the particle number projection method for non - separable density dependent forces . in section  [ sec : ddp ] we present the formalism for the density dependent part of the interaction and discuss some alternative prescriptions to this dependence .",
    "the gradient of the projected energy to be implemented in the calculations is developed in section  [ sec : vap ] . in section  [ sec : convl ] , we present results for the projection after variation ( pav ) method for the nucleus @xmath0er and discuss the problems associated with the divergent terms .",
    "results for the variation after projection ( vap ) method for the nuclei @xmath1cr are discussed in section  [ sec : vapr ] .",
    "the particle number projected hartree  fock ",
    "bogoliubov theory is the simplest symmetry conserving mean field approach which takes into account particle - particle correlations .",
    "this theory has been derived in the past for non - density dependent interactions and a detailed formulation has only been given for separable forces like the pairing plus quadrupole model @xcite . in order to generalize this theory to non - separable and density dependent forces , like the gogny or the skyrme force , and to introduce the pertinent notation we shall also summarize the known formulation .",
    "let @xmath2 be a product wave function of the hfb type , i.e , the vacuum to the quasiparticle operators given by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the particle annihilation and creation operators ( usually in the harmonic oscillator basis ) .",
    "this transformation does not conserve the particle number symmetry and the wave function @xmath2 is not an eigenstate of the particle number operator @xmath5 .",
    "one can generate , however , out of @xmath2 , an eigenstate , @xmath6 , of @xmath5 by the well known projection technique @xcite @xmath7 where the integration interval can be reduced to @xmath8 $ ] whenever the intrinsic wave function has a well defined `` number parity '' @xcite quantum number .",
    "furthermore , the integral can be discretized in a sum using the fomenko expansion @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of points used in the calculations , for @xmath11 one gets the exact solution , usually @xmath12 is used in the calculations .",
    "@xmath13 projects only on one system of particles , in the general case , however , one has to perform a double projection , for the number of neutrons and protons . in this case the projected matrix element of any operator @xmath14 , such that @xmath15=0 $ ] , is given by @xcite @xmath16 where we have introduced @xmath17 and the @xmath14-operator overlap @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
