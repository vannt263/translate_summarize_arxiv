    "the studies of nonlinear excitations of two - dimensional ( 2d ) and quasi 2d correlated spin systems are an important issue of modern physics of magnetism , and can be useful for development of general soliton concepts .",
    "@xcite the topological textures like localized solitons ( skyrmions @xcite ) or magnetic vortices make an important contribution to the thermodynamics of magnetically ordered systems @xcite or even determine the character of its ordering as in the case of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "@xcite last years the interest for two - dimensional solitons has grown since they are frequently realized as ground state in the finite - size mesoscopic magnetic samples , so - called magnetic dots .  @xcite    the most `` famous '' topological solitons are magnetic vortices having @xmath9 topological charge .",
    "these vortices are usually related to thermodynamic aspects of soliton physics .",
    "@xcite also , they appear in mesoscopic nanostructures .  @xcite easy - plane magnets with continuously degenerated ground state have vortices with the energy being logarithmically divergent as a function of system size .",
    "the other and much less studied example of topological solitons are magnetic skyrmions which are present in isotropic or easy - axis magnets .",
    "contrary to the above vortices , the latter textures are characterized by nontrivial @xmath0 topological charge and finite energy .",
    "it is known that they determine the response functions of 2d magnets at finite temperatures @xcite and take part in long - range order breakdown in isotropic magnets .",
    "@xcite the skyrmions form ground state of magnetic nanoparticles with easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "@xcite their analysis is more complicated as compared to magnetic vortices and comprises many nontrivial features .",
    "an important example of latter features is the problem of a skyrmion stability since due to hobart - derrick theorem the static solitons with finite energy are unstable for wide class of models including standard continuous magnetic models .",
    "@xcite    for magnetic vortices , the consideration of lowest possible topological charge @xmath10 is sufficiently as the vortex energy grows with @xmath3 , @xmath11 .",
    "because of that it is advantageous for a vortex with @xmath12 to decay for @xmath13 vortices with @xmath10 and the vortices with @xmath7 can be stable in exceptional cases only .",
    "@xcite the situation for skyrmions is not that simple .",

    "solution has the energy @xmath25 so that the state of bp skyrmions with @xmath12 merges or dissociates into several other similar skyrmions with different @xmath26 s ( the only rule that in such process the topological charge should conserve ) without their energy altering .",
    "such exact degeneration is related to very high hidden symmetry , stemming from exact integrability of corresponding static model ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this degeneration should certainly be lifted if we go beyond the model .",
    "the most important characteristic here is the parameter @xmath27 , which is appropriate to call the _ topological energy density _ , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy of a soliton with topological charge @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a growing function of @xmath13 , the most favorable state with a given @xmath13 comprises @xmath3 solitons with unit topological charge otherwise such state is unstable .",
    "latter question is especially important for the investigation of general regularities of the highly excited magnet states evolution , ( see , e.g. ref .   and references therein ) or for the analysis of essentially inhomogeneous magnet states under strong pumping .",
    "@xcite latter states can be generated by the ultrafast pulses of magnetic field , see refs .",
    "for details .",
    "the preceding discussion demonstrates that the problem of obtaining and investigation of the stable skyrmions with higher topological charges is extremely important .",
    "@xcite    the present work is devoted to the analysis of skyrmions with higher @xmath0 topological charges in 2d heisenberg ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "we show that there exists a certain range of system parameters ( exchange and anisotropy constants ) , where stable precessional solitons with topological charge @xmath30 exist .",
    "it turns out that in wide range of anisotropy constants , the topological energy density @xmath31 of the textures with @xmath30 is lower then that of the textures with @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "the solitons with @xmath5 and @xmath33 have monotonously growing phase boundary functions @xmath34 , while the case @xmath7 has peculiar nonmonotonous behavior , determining the transition regime from low to high topological charges .",
    "this means that the preferable values of soliton topological charge are neither @xmath5 nor high charges , but rather @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "we begin with the discrete model of a classical 2d fm with uniaxial anisotropy , described by the following hamiltonian @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is a classical spin vector with fixed length @xmath18 on the site @xmath37 of a 2d square lattice .",
    "the summations run over all lattice sites @xmath37 and nearest ",
    "neighbors @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the exchange integral and the constant @xmath40 describes the anisotropy of spin interaction . in subsequent discussion , we refer to this type of anisotropy as exchange anisotropy ( ea ) . additionally , we took into account single - ion anisotropy ( sia ) with constant @xmath41 .",
    "we consider @xmath42axis to be easy magnetization direction so that @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the analysis of real magnetic systems with discreet spins can be performed only numerically . in principle , it can be done by the same method as was described in ref .  , but it is not easy to extract necessary information from the set of numerical data . on the other hand ,",
    "if we neglect the specific effects of discreteness ( which appear at strong anisotropy only , @xmath45 ) , like the presence of pure collinear structures , see ref .  , the consideration can be simplified using the generalized continuous approximation and classical landau - lifshitz equation . in this approximation",
    "we can introduce the smooth function @xmath46 instead of discreet variable @xmath47 . in this case , the classical magnetic energy functional @xmath48 $ ] can be constructed expanding the discrete hamiltonian in power series of magnetization gradients , yielding @xmath49 where @xmath50 contains zeroth and second order contributions to magnetic energy , see , and @xmath51 contains the fourth powers of gradients .",
    "the explicit ( and quite cumbersome ) expressions for @xmath50 and @xmath51 had been presented in ref .  .",
    "we note here , that single - ion anisotropy enters only @xmath50 , but not @xmath51 and higher terms , while exchange anisotropy enters every term of the expansion .    for isotropic case @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", @xmath50 coincides with the energy of the isotropic continuous model bearing bp soliton solutions of the form with degenerate ( with respect to topological charge ) topological energy density , see also .",
    "a simple accounting of magnetic anisotropy in @xmath50 generates a model , which is typical example of the models governed by hobbard - derrick theorem - it does not admit static stable soliton solutions . in the model with @xmath54 only , the size of any texture like domain wall , soliton etc ( see , e.g. ref . for details ) is given by the characteristic length @xmath55 @xmath56 in the case of weak anisotropy , @xmath57 , the length scale @xmath58 so that the magnetization varies slowly in a space .",
    "now we consider generalized model , including higher powers of gradients . in the expansion ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the terms of fourth order only as they are playing a decisive role in solitons stabilization , see refs .   for details .",
    "the simplest possible generalized model with account for @xmath51 only can in principle admit the above static stable solitons .",
    "@xcite simple scaling arguments can demonstrate that .",
    "namely , if the soliton core has size @xmath59 , the specific calculations with energy functionals like ( see below ) yield the dependence of the energy @xmath60 on @xmath59 in the form @xmath61 where the first term comes from @xmath51 and the rest come from @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath62 had a minimum ( this occurs if @xmath63 ) , this would mean the existence of a stable static skyrmion .",
    "unfortunately , for the real model of magnet @xmath64 so that the first term is negative and the dependence @xmath65 does not have a minimum .",
    "we note also that the expansion and the above scale arguments are valid for any symmetry of initial 2d discrete lattice .",
    "the only difference is in the coefficients before gradient powers .",
    "although these coefficients influence the solitons properties , the main feature of these expansions , consisting in the fact that in eq .",
    "@xmath66 remains the same .",
    "in other words , we did not find any symmetry of 2d fm with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction , where @xmath67 has a minimum so that stable static soliton can exist .",
    "@xcite    in the absence of _ static _ two  dimensional solitons , it is possible to construct stable soliton states with _ stationary dynamics _ , due to the presence of additional integrals of motion for magnetization fields .",
    "the purely uniaxial model possesses the exact symmetry with respect to the spin rotation around @xmath68axis so that the energy functional @xmath69 $ ] does not depend explicitly on the variable @xmath70 .",
    "this leads to the appearance of an additional integral of motion , @xmath42-projection of total spin .",
    "this integral of motion can be conveniently parameterized via integer @xmath71 defining a number of bound magnons in a soliton @xmath71 , see ref .   for details .",
    "in continuous approximation it can be written as @xmath72 conservation of @xmath71 leads to the presence of so  called _ precessional _ solitons characterizing by time - independent projection of magnetization onto the easy @xmath68axis and with the precession of the magnetization vector @xmath73 at constant frequency @xmath74 around the @xmath42 axis , @xmath75 which holds instead of ( [ qe2 ] ) in this case .",
    "the analogs of such precessional solitons are known to occur in different field - theoretical models , it is enough to note the non - topological coleman s @xmath76-balls ,  @xcite which do not have topological properties as well as @xmath0 topological @xmath76 - lumps ,  @xcite see ref .   for details .    stable dynamical solutions with nonzero @xmath74 correspond to conditional ( for fixed @xmath71 value ) minimum of the energy functional @xmath77 .",
    "namely , we may look for an extremum of the expression @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an internal soliton precession frequency , which in this case can be regarded as lagrange multiplier .",
    "note , that functional is nothing but the lagrangian of 2d fm magnetization field calculated with respect to specific time dependence .",
    "this condition leads to the relation @xcite @xmath80 , which determines the microscopic origin of the precessional frequency @xmath74 .",
    "namely , an addition of one extra spin deviation ( bound magnon ) to a soliton changes its energy by @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the dependencies @xmath82 and @xmath83 are very important for the problem of a soliton stability .",
    "further analysis of above continuous model consists in the solution of differential equations for soliton structure , what is equivalent to the minimization of the functional .",
    "as these equations can barely be solved analytically , here we analyze the solitons properties by direct variational method . as we have shown earlier by comparison of variational approach and direct numerical minimization of initial discreet energy on a lattice ,",
    "@xcite the variational approach gives fairly good results for weak anisotropies @xmath84 , where the generalized continuous description is valid .",
    "the continuous models like and are usually parameterized by angular variables so that the energy @xmath29 becomes a functional of these variables , @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "having energy functional @xmath29 , we can write the corresponding landau - lifshitz equations and lagrangian .    to apply direct variational method for minimization of the energy @xmath86 we use the trial function @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mcdonald function with index @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite note , that trial function ( [ macd ] ) is based on the interpolative solution , constructed in ref .  .",
    "the trial function gives correct asymptotics both for @xmath89 ( corresponding to bp soliton ) and for @xmath90 ( exponential decay with some characteristic scale @xmath91 ) , see refs .   for details .",
    "latter exponential asymptotics is absent for solitons in isotropic 2d fm , e.g. for bp soliton .",
    "it can be shown that the exponential asymptotics occurs for anisotropic models , where the length of decay is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "it had been demonstrated that due to power - law asymptotics of @xmath92 for isotropic magnet , the integrals defining soliton energy and number of bound magnons ( see below eqs . ) are divergent for @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite to avoid this divergency in anisotropic models like , the interpolative ( between bp asymptotics at @xmath89 and exponential one at @xmath93 ) solution had been put forward in ref . .",
    "our analysis of continuous model shows that at @xmath5 the above divergence can be cut off by the exponential asymptotics only .",
    "for @xmath7 the power - law asymptotics is sufficient for convergence of corresponding integrals , while their derivatives with respect to parameter @xmath94 are divergent . in this case , the divergences in derivatives are also eliminated by exponential asymptotics . at @xmath95",
    "all integrals and their derivatives ( with respect to @xmath94 ) are convergent .",
    "this means that the behavior of solitons with @xmath5 and 2 on one side and those with @xmath95 on the other side is different , being determined by the interplay between effects of anisotropy and higher spatial derivatives . in our minimization method ,",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is variational , while the parameter @xmath59 is kept constant as it is related to @xmath71 , @xmath97 , see , e.g. @xcite . in other words , we minimize the energy @xmath98 with the trial function ( [ macd ] ) over @xmath96 for constant @xmath59 .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it also permits to investigate the stability of obtained soliton texture .",
    "namely , a soliton is stable if it corresponds to the conditional minimum of the energy at fixed @xmath71 , and it is unstable otherwise .    to proceed further ,",
    "we introduce following dimensionless variables @xmath99 and express trial function in terms of them .",
    "we have @xmath100 then using the equation , we can calculate the number of bound magnons in the soliton @xmath101 in the variables the soliton energy assumes the form @xmath102 where    @xmath103 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\gamma _ 4(z)=\\int_0^{\\infty } xdx\\biggl\\{\\left ( \\delta _ x\\theta \\right)^2\\left ( 1+\\kappa \\sin ^2\\theta \\right ) + \\theta^{\\prime 4 } \\left ( 1+\\kappa \\cos ^2\\theta \\right ) + \\frac{\\nu^2\\sin ^2\\theta } { x^2}% \\left ( \\frac{\\nu^2}{x^{2}}+2\\theta ^{\\prime 2}\\right ) +   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta _ { x}\\theta \\sin 2\\theta \\left ( \\kappa \\theta ^{\\prime 2}-\\frac{% \\nu ^2}{x^2}\\right ) \\biggr\\},\\ \\ \\theta ' = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx } , \\ \\delta _ x\\theta = \\frac{d ^2 \\theta}{dx^2 } + \\frac 1x\\frac{d \\theta}{dx}\\;. \\label{asm7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , we express the energy and the number of magnons via two parameters , @xmath104 and @xmath42 .",
    "it turns out , that initial dimensional variables @xmath96 and @xmath59 enter the problem only in the form of their product @xmath42 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath71 and @xmath29 on @xmath42 enters the problem via a few complicated functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which can be written only implicitly in the form of integrals .",
    "however , in terms of these functions , the dependence on @xmath107 ( [ dimen ] ) turns out to be quite simple .",
    "this permits reformulation of the initial variational problem in terms of variables @xmath42 and @xmath71 only .",
    "namely , we express @xmath108 and substitute this expression into the dimensionless energy ( [ dimen ] ) .",
    "this gives us the expression for the energy of a soliton with given @xmath71 , as a function of variational parameter @xmath42 .",
    "then we can find a minimum of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath42 , keeping @xmath71 constant .",
    "the result of such numerical minimization in the form of the dependence @xmath109 is shown in fig.[fig : v1 ] for a magnet with purely exchange anisotropy @xmath110 .",
    "the curves for higher @xmath40 are qualitatively the same . to justify the applicability of our direct variational approach ,",
    "earlier we have shown,@xcite that for @xmath5 the dependencies @xmath111 found by variational and numerical minimizations of the energy , are identical at small enough anisotropy , @xmath112 .",
    "our analysis shows ( see also fig.[fig : v1 ] ) that topological energy density grows slowly as function of @xmath71 .",
    "we note here that this property holds for all anisotropy constants and topological charges .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that all curves @xmath109 have threshold points @xmath113 so that solitons exist only at @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "these threshold values determine the minimal soliton energy , which is most important characteristic of soliton contribution into magnet thermodynamics and can be observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite for instance ( see fig.[fig : v1 ] ) , at @xmath10 and @xmath116 @xmath117 , which is substantially higher then that expected from eq .",
    "@xmath118 .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] demonstrates one more unexpected soliton property , namely that at @xmath116 the energy density @xmath111 _ decreases _ with increase of @xmath13 and fixed @xmath71 value . as we will show below",
    ", such behavior occurs for many values of @xmath119 , although there can be exceptions .",
    "the most important feature , however , is the existence of above threshold energy and bound magnons number values .",
    "the behavior of these values at variation of anisotropy constants is quite nontrivial .",
    "for example , at @xmath116 ( the value chosen for fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] ) @xmath120 but @xmath121 . at the same time , the corresponding threshold energies behave monotonically @xmath122 .",
    "our extensive analysis of numerical curves @xmath109 for different anisotropies have shown that their overall behavior is dictated primarily by the threshold values : if @xmath123 , then the entire curve @xmath109 lies above corresponding curve @xmath124 in wide interval of @xmath71 s .",
    "this shows the importance of the above threshold values for the properties of solitons .",
    "the information about these values can be conveniently represented in the form of so - called solitons phase diagram , i.e. the dependence of @xmath125 and @xmath126 on @xmath127 .",
    "to obtain the phase diagram , we should pay attention to the details of above minimization procedure .",
    "namely , to obtain truly stable soliton texture we should demand that the conditional extremum of the energy @xmath60 is a minimum .",
    "so , we keep track not only to the first derivative @xmath128 to be zero but also to the second derivative to be positive ( corresponding to a minimum ) at the point @xmath129 , where @xmath130 . when a soliton approaches the limit of its stability , the modulus of second derivative diminishes , becoming zero at the stability limit @xmath131 , corresponding to above values @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "thus the above soliton phase diagram is indeed determined by the instability point @xmath131 ( as a function of ratio @xmath134 ) where both first and second derivatives of the energy are zero .",
    "the shape of the above phase diagram is determined by the character of anisotropy and @xmath3 value and is reported on fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] for exchange anisotropy .",
    "first of all , one can see that the dependence @xmath135 is quite complicated and its character change twice , at @xmath136 and at @xmath137 .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig : v2]a that while there is a quite large region of @xmath4 values , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are smaller then @xmath140 , the region where @xmath141 is approximately three times smaller .",
    "we have shown that @xmath142 is always larger then @xmath139 although still smaller then @xmath143 . the energy @xmath135 is growing with @xmath3 at @xmath144 only .",
    "[ fig : v2]b demonstrates the divergence of @xmath145 at small @xmath146 as @xmath5 and 2 .",
    "this is related to the fact that in bp soliton the integral describing @xmath71 diverges logarithmically as @xmath93 for @xmath10 , see also above .",

    "[ fig : v2 ] demonstrates the complicated behavior of solitons phase diagram , which is needed to be understood . to understand better the above complex behavior",
    ", it is instructive to obtain the phase diagram analytically . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall do so for the case of uniaxial anisotropy only .",
    "such analytical treatment is possible since the anisotropy constant @xmath41 in this case enters the problem only via coefficient in the first term of eq . .",
    "this permits to obtain the analytic dependencies @xmath147 and @xmath148 in the inverse form @xmath149 .",

    "in this paper we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the localized topological solitons ( skyrmions ) , stabilized by precessional spin dynamics , for the classical 2d ferromagnet with easy - axial anisotropy on a square lattice .",

    "this means , that mapping of the initial discrete model even for small anisotropy @xmath57 on the simplest continuum model is wrong and to get the correct description of solitons in 2d fm we have to consider at least fourth powers of magnetization gradients .",
    "this seemingly paradoxical result is actually due to the fact that the terms with @xmath187 are scale - invariant ( so that the corresponding energy has a saddle point ) while the ( stable ) soliton size is determined by the fourth derivatives as well as by a magnetic anisotropy .",
    "our analysis show , that higher ( then fourth ) powers of magnetization gradients do not change the situation qualitatively , rather , in the range of above - studied @xmath188 these terms make only a small quantitative contribution to the solitons phase diagram .",
    "this means , that solitons with @xmath5 can be well studied within the model .    in summary , we have shown the existence of stable topological @xmath189 solitons ( skyrmions ) in the 2d ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy on a square lattice . since for any 2d lattice symmetry the structure of corresponding energy functional is the same , we may speculate that such textures exist in any 2d magnet with uniaxial anisotropy . we also show that due to different character of the energy and magnons number integrals convergence at @xmath190 and @xmath191 determines the features of so - called solitons phase diagram .",
    "the main nontrivial and unexpected result of the paper is that while the solitons with @xmath5 and @xmath33 have monotonously growing phase boundary functions @xmath34 , the case @xmath7 has peculiar nonmonotonous behavior , determining the transition regime from low to high topological charges .",
    "this means that the designated value of soliton topological charge , which is expected for highly excited state of fm , is neither @xmath5 nor high charges , but rather @xmath7 or @xmath8 .                              c.  e. zaspel , t.  e. grigereit , and j.  e. drumheller , phys .",
