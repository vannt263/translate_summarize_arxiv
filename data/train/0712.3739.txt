    "by use of the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) , very accurate results have been obtained for the equation of state for fluids @xcite and lattice systems ( or the ising spin system ) @xcite .",
    "also in the critical region the results are very accurate , showing non - classical critical behavior @xcite , but a form of generalized scaling is obtained in the critical region instead of full scaling @xcite .    looking more closely into the data one finds that for the lattice gas , or nearest neighbor ising model , results are somewhat better than those for the continuum fluid .",
    "the scoza critical temperature @xmath1 of the former is about @xmath2 away from the best estimates @xcite , while this separation is about @xmath3 for the commonly considered yukawa fluid ( @xmath4 ) according to recent estimates based on monte carlo ( mc ) computations @xcite . here",
    "we will analyze this situation in view of renormalized @xmath0-ordering @xcite , and we will propose a modified version of scoza . a slightly simplified variant of this scheme is implemented and solved numerically , yielding essentially perfect agreement with simulations for potential ranges relevant for the liquid state . for extremely short - ranged potentials where the gas - liquid transition is deeply buried inside the metastable region , however ,",
    "agreement is less satisfactory , and the numerical procedure may even fail to converge to consistency with the virial pressure .",
    "as scoza builds upon the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) , we can understand that scoza is more accurate for lattice gases than for fluids by noting that this is true for the msa , too . by further analysis",
    "it is seen that for fluids a significant contribution to the direct correlation function of short range is missing .",
    "when this contribution is included , it enlarges the amplitude of the correlation function and thus amplifies the internal energy due to correlations ( which is negative ) .",
    "this further increases the deviation from the corresponding mean field or van der waals type equation of state . since correlations lower the critical temperature , the net result is a further lowering of it . for the yukawa interaction typically used as a model potential in simulations",
    ", we expect this additional lowering to be something like @xmath5 as a crude estimate .",
    "an immediate problem here is the determination of the proper range of this short range piece of the direct correlation function . in this respect",
    "we can be guided by considering thermodynamic consistency with the virial theorem to estimate the range mentioned .    in section  [ sec :",
    "gamma ] we will investigate the relation between the msa and renormalized @xmath0-ordering for potentials of long range . then in section  [ sec : scoza ] thermodynamic consistency with the virial theorem is considered and applied to scoza . a modified theory",
    "is then formulated on this basis in section  [ sec : theory ] , and applied to the one - yukawa problem numerically in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "a short summary ( section  [ sec : summary ] ) concludes our contribution .",

    "( it should be noted that @xmath11 is not restricted to interactions of yukawa form . )    for a lattice gas or an ising spin system the boundary conditions become @xmath12 so in this case we have @xmath13 for lattice cells of unit volume .",

    "( [ eq : def : mu ] ) , relation  ( [ eq : core : mu ] ) can also be written as @xmath28 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath29 . in this form",
    "we can recognize the relation obtained by the resummation or renormalization process to obtain the equation of state for fluids when the inverse range of the attractive interaction @xmath0 is used as a perturbing parameter @xcite ( see eqs .",

    "they are regarded as @xmath34-functions of relative distance @xmath35 so that only the integral  ( [ eq : jh:10 ] ) is needed as a leading order approximation .",

    "the above results will be modified , but the qualitative features of the msa inconsistency will remain .",
    "the scoza differs from the msa in its imposition of thermodynamic consistency between the energy and compressibility routes to thermodynamics : a state - dependent free parameter is introduced into the pair structure and determined in such a way that the consistency condition @xmath47 holds . here",

    "this contribution is then added to the reference system correlation function or vertex @xmath27 to obtain the renormalized vertex @xmath30 @xcite .    for lattice gases , however",
    ", we do not need to consider this term explicitly as the core condition  ( [ eq : core : mu ] ) is then equivalent to  ( [ eq : core : renorm ] ) . to fulfill the former ,",
    "a constant @xmath19 is added to the direct correlation function @xmath9 at @xmath80 .",
    "this can also be regarded as a short range piece of the perturbing potential such that @xmath81 in expression  ( [ eq : core : mu ] ) is replaced by @xmath82 .",
    "the consequence of this is that the chain bond integral  ( [ eq : core : mu ] ) becomes zero and renormalization  ( [ eq : core : renorm ] ) drops out as @xmath19 has already taken care of it .    for continuum fluids , however , eq .",
    "( [ eq : core : renorm ] ) can not be replaced by a @xmath83 only inside hard cores if the core condition is to be kept ; the short range part of it goes outside the core in contrast to the lattice gas system .",

    "this term will have both an amplitude and a range . in a scoza scheme",
    "this means two unknown parameters if now the remaining part of @xmath9 is just its msa form outside the core , _ i.  e. _ , the new term replaces the earlier need for an effective temperature .    assuming the added short - range piece to the direct correlation to be of yukawa form , too",

    "i.  e. _ , its amplitude can be identified with the inverse temperature , @xmath86 , while its form coincides with that of the interaction , @xmath87 ; this also means that @xmath9 asymptotically coincides with @xmath88 for large @xmath35 as it should except at the critical point . @xmath89 and @xmath90 , on the other hand ,",
    "are the two unknown parameters of the added short range piece to @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , conventional scoza is recovered when setting @xmath91 , with @xmath92 playing the role of the effective inverse temperature @xmath51 .",
    "the use of an effective parameter @xmath51 is common to conventional scoza problems .",
    "so the differences between various scoza problems lie in the actual equations used .",
    "these again depend upon whether continuum fluids or lattice gases are considered , and further they depend upon the pair interaction used . however , in the present case this conventional scheme is modified by which we have two unknown parameters present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : closure ] ) . as only one parameter can be determined in `` standard '' scoza , an option is to keep the range fixed and to make evaluations for various values of @xmath90 to see how the estimated change in @xmath1 comes out .",
    "furthermore , scoza allows the contact value of @xmath8 at the hard core surface to be obtained so that we can also check consistency with the virial theorem .",
    "alternatively , the range parameter @xmath90 can also be adjusted alongside @xmath89 as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath29 so that consistency between all three of the energy , virial , and compressibility routes is obtained throughout the temperature - density plane . in this more ambitious scoza evaluation",
    "first proposed by hye and stell @xcite both unknown parameters , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , are supposed to be determined simultaneously .",
    "this scheme thus bears some resemblance to the version of the generalized mean spherical approximation studied in ref .",
    "that did not , however , take into account @xmath84 outside the core .",
    "yet another possibility is to keep @xmath90 fixed for all densities and temperatures , choosing it in such a way that consistency with the virial theorem is achieved at the critical point .",
    "this has the advantage over full consistency of being much easier to implement while it can be expected that this simpler version already incorporates most of the effect of full consistency with the virial route , at least when using the location of the critical point and the phase boundary to gauge the relative accuracy and performance of various liquid state theories as we will do here .",
    "in our computations we found it advantageous to adopt the waisman recipe for the direct correlation function @xmath84 of the hard sphere reference system , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath93 with density dependent parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 that reproduce the carnahan starling equation of state @xcite . just as in conventional scoza , the direct correlation function outside the hard core is then just a sum of yukawa terms for which the solution of the oz equation together with the core condition , @xmath96 for @xmath97 , is known semi - analytically by way of a wiener - hopf factorization and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : route : eny ] ) and  ( [ eq : route : comp ] ) can be evaluated efficiently  @xcite .",
    "the main change required vis -  - vis the conventional theory is the shift from @xmath98 , which acquires an explicit temperature dependence , to @xmath89 as the adjustable parameter ; also , it becomes necessary to implement the virial route expressionsin this respect it is worth pointing out that the expressions given in appendix  iii of ref .",
    "are only valid for @xmath99 and thus can not be used here .",
    "the results of ref .  , while not optimized for numerical evaluation , are free of this restriction . ] that do not normally feature in scoza computations but already appeared in the preliminary evaluation of our recent adaptation of scoza to molecules with soft cores @xcite .    for an interaction composed of a hard core of unit diameter with a perturbing tail @xmath11 , the virial theorem , @xmath100,\\ ] ]",

    "( [ eq : route : eny ] ) and  ( [ eq : route : comp ] ) , also provide us with explicit expressions for the laplace transform @xmath105 of @xmath106 @xcite from which the contact value can be worked out @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the interaction is a sum of yukawa terms with inverse length scale parameters @xmath107 , it is easily seen that the integral on the right hand side of the relation above reduces to a sum of linear combinations of @xmath105 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 set to each of the @xmath107 . as both conditions are met in our case , the virial pressure can be evaluated numerically no less efficiently than the other thermodynamic quantities commonly entering scoza .",
    "implementation of the theory outlined in section [ sec : theory ] started from our re - implementation of conventional scoza , which has been developed with a view to great conceptual simplicity , modularity , and flexibility and has turned out to be a convenient testbed for modifications of both the theory and its numerical realization .",
    "methodically it largely follows the work of schll - paschinger @xcite ; the main differences are the avoidance of general non - linear solving routines through the systematic use of linearizations ( which also eliminates the need for cumbersome implicit differentiations and incidentally brings about a significant speed advantage ) and an improved implementation of the artificial spinodal boundary condition ( _ v .",
    "i. _ ) that is more efficient computationally and does not restrict the estimated spinodal to the discretization grid , nor does it use the ill - founded criterion of minimal width of the spinodal .    for the computations below , we solved the scoza pde  ( [ eq : scoza : pde ] ) by an iterated predictor - corrector method on density grids of @xmath110 density steps spanning the range @xmath111 with the ideal gas ( @xmath112 ) and the msa ( @xmath113 ) as boundary conditions at @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath50 was turned on from @xmath116 , where the hard sphere reference fluid provided the initial conditions , down to the critical point with temperature steps decreasing upon approaching the critical point in approximate proportionality to @xmath117 . below the critical point",
    "the temperature steps increased again in such a way that the shift of the spinodal per integration step was limited to less than one density step .",
    "below the critical point there is a region where the analytical solution of the oz equation becomes invalid @xcite , and even a fully numerical procedure @xcite that does not rely on the analytical result eventually runs into problems of numerical convergence @xcite .",
    "either way , it proves necessary to remove part of the solution from the pde s domain through the imposition of an artificial boundary condition at the spinodal . in our implementation",
    "we do so by estimating its location at the new temperature from the solution of the pde at the previous temperature on nearby grid points and forcing the internal energy there to be compatible with @xmath118 .",
    "pressure and chemical potential are obtained by thermodynamic integration at fixed density , starting from the hard core reference fluid at @xmath116 .",
    "this allows the binodal to be found by locating densities @xmath119 and @xmath120 of the coexisting vapour and liquid phases of equal pressure , @xmath121 , and chemical potential , @xmath122 .",
    "the critical point is identified with the locus where the liquid and vapour branches of the spinodal and the binodal meet .",
    "this computation is then repeated for different values of @xmath90 . to illustrate the dependency of the critical parameters on @xmath90 ,",
    "let us consider the potential with @xmath4 that is known to exhibit thermodynamics roughly equivalent to the lj interaction . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : z2:betac ] , the critical temperature obtained with @xmath123 is indeed a bit lower than that for conventional scoza ( @xmath91 ) , and typical shifts are comparable to the estimate  ( [ eq : scoza : shift : estimate ] ) obtained using results for the lj interaction .",
    "as we solve the scoza pde , we compare the pressure obtained from thermodynamic integration to the virial route result . in general ,",
    "for every value of @xmath90 there will be lines along which consistency between scoza and the virial theorem occurs ; this is illustrated , again for the case of @xmath4 , in fig .  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "as can be seen , the geometry of these lines is rather complex , especially below the critical point .",
    "we expect this distribution of @xmath90 values to resemble quite closely the function @xmath124 that would be obtained with the more general version of the theory imposing consistency with the virial route throughout the pde s domain , _ cf .",
    "_ section  [ sec : theory ] .    in the present contribution , however , we consider a simpler version of scoza where @xmath90 is determined from consistency at the critical point only . numerically the search for this optimal value of @xmath90 calls for repeated solutions of the scoza pde and might thus seem to be exceedingly burdensome .",
    "in contrast to , _ e.  g. _ , ref .   where this is indeed a concern , however , we can use the semi - analytic solution of the oz equation . in combination with a very small number of yukawa terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : closure ] ) the integration of the pde down to the critical temperature is sufficiently fast so that the search for @xmath90 does not constitute a problem .    in table [",

    "as expected , the critical temperature is shifted to lower values ; for the lj value of @xmath4 this difference is about @xmath137 and thus well compatible with the estimate  ( [ eq : scoza : shift : estimate ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the shift in critical temperature is also accompanied by a small decrease of the critical density .",
    "both effects become more pronounced as @xmath133 becomes larger .",
    "the available simulations confirm that the shift in @xmath1 is certainly in the right direction , and the agreement is excellent considering the uncertainties of the simulation studies that generally cite non - overlapping confidence intervals for the same interaction .",
    "for some values of @xmath133 the prediction of our modified scoza falls right into the confidence interval of some study , as is the case for @xmath4 and the sophisticated analysis of ref .   or for @xmath138 and",
    "the gemc result of ref .  .",
    "for the nearby value of @xmath139 deemed relevant to the fullerene c@xmath140 , on the other hand , two different studies @xcite agree that our @xmath1 is too high , if by significantly different amounts , whereas our prediction is right between the results of the same two references for @xmath141 .",
    "for @xmath142 , our modified scoza is marginally compatible with the gemc  results . by way of contrast ,",
    "conventional scoza ( @xmath143 ) yields too high a critical temperature in all cases .",
    "this situation is summarized graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ; to judge by @xmath1 , the variant of scoza studied in the present contribution thus constitutes a genuine progress over its conventional form , and the available simulations are not sufficiently accurate to point out systematic deficiencies in the critical temperatures predicted .",
    "as for the critical density , both old and new scoza are well compatible with the results for @xmath144 .",
    "only for @xmath4 are we able to differentiate between the two versions of the theory : the modified scoza is in perfect agreement with the the extremely narrow confidence interval obtained by way of gcmc and fss methods whereas conventional scoza lies somewhat outside this range , thus hinting at the superiority of our modifications for the critical density , too .    as the potential becomes more and more short - ranged , however , discrepancies start to appear : for one , our modifications always bring about a shift of the critical density to lower values , but at @xmath141 the gemc @xmath145 is already higher than that of conventional scoza .",
    "similarly , the critical temperature is always lowered , but the mcsimulations for the two highest values of @xmath133 listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : comparison ] , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath134 yield critical temperatures that are far greater even than those of conventional scoza ; furthermore , consistency with the virial theorem does not seem achievable at all for @xmath146 , presumably due to numerical difficulties with the evaluation of the virial pressure ( _ cf . _  footnote  [ fn : arrieta ] ) . clearly , more work is needed to clarify the situation at these extremely high values of @xmath133 that are , however , far outside the range of stability of the liquid - vapour transition and thus of limited interest for a liquid state theory .",
    "in the present contribution we have considered in some depth the question of thermodynamic consistency between msa and scoza ( that builds upon msa but incorporates consistency between the energy and compressibility routes ) on the one hand , and the virial route on the other hand . the basis for our investigations",
    "is formed by an analysis of the solution of the msa closure in the presence of the core condition in the light of renormalized @xmath0-ordering that highlights a crucial difference between the lattice and the continuum cases .",
    "for the latter it is seen that a short - range piece must be added to the direct correlation function , and it is this term that we propose to be adjusted instead of the usual potential term .",
    "this scheme has been implemented numerically in a simplified version where only the amplitude of this contribution to @xmath9 is varied throughout the @xmath147-plane according to the usual scoza procedure implementing consistency between the energy and compressibility routes only whereas its range is fixed by imposing consistency with the virial route at the critical point only .",
    "comparison with the results of various simulation studies shows that these modifications bring about significant improvements over conventional scoza ; particularly encouraging is the perfect agreement with a sophisticated and extremely accurate study combining gcmc simulations with fss analysis for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if all our evaluations have been restricted to the hard - core yukawa class of interactions , the question arises naturally whether this approach can be applied to other types of potentials , too . in this respect",
    "it is clear that nothing prevents us from adding some yukawa term to the msa direct correlation function for , say , a lennard - jones potential and using the same strategies for evaluating its range parameter and solving the modified scoza pde . at the same time , however , the form of the yukawa potential is special in that it is most attractive right at the core whereas more realistic interactions reach the maximum of the depth of the potential only at greater distances . for",
    "these a contribution of yukawa form to the direct correlation function hardly seems appropriate .",
    "so clearly more work is needed before the results presented here can be transferred to other cases .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the strategy of using the virial theorem ( that does not traditionally feature in scoza at all ) as a means of gauging the fluid structure close to the repulsive core to remain the key for fixing the form of the adjustable part of the direct correlation function .",
    "this strategy , it should be noted , also featured prominently in our earlier work on scoza for molecules with soft cores @xcite .",
