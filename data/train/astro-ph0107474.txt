    "the morphology and evolution of galaxies are for a major part determined by their environment .",
    "spectacular systems such as the antennae @xcite and the cartwheel galaxy @xcite are extreme examples of distortion caused by nearby companions .",
    "locally , the magellanic stream offers a close - up view of a system dominated by the gravitational field of the milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "intense infrared emission appears to be triggered by strong interactions between spirals that are rich in molecular gas @xcite , and there is evidence that low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies accompanied by nearby dwarf galaxies will be rapidly transformed into star - bursting blue compact galaxies because of tidal effects @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations support the observations , showing galaxy harassment to be capable of transforming disk galaxies into spheroidal galaxies @xcite and perhaps also of seeding quasar formation in massive , low surface brightness disks @xcite .",
    "understanding the effects that companions have on their parent galaxies is therefore important in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "while a number of galaxies , especially the milky way , are known to be embedded in a halo of dwarf galaxies , very few galaxies are known to have _ gravitationally bound _ companions .",
    "if , as is often claimed , galaxy formation is still on - going ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many galaxies should still be surrounded by a halo of dwarf galaxies and infalling neutral hydrogen gas ( hi ) clouds .",
    "occasional serendipitous discoveries have given us tantalising glimpses of these kind of phenomena , such as infalling dwarf galaxies surrounding magellanic irregulars @xcite , and infalling gas clouds in lsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "for the systems that are known , the dynamics of the infalling dwarf galaxies are an excellent indicator of the presence and mass of dark matter in the parent galaxy , especially since the dwarfs are found out to much larger radii than the galaxy disk @xcite .    to address the lack of information pertaining to companions to known galaxies , we have commenced a deep hi  survey of extended regions around selected nearby galaxies .",
    "hi  observations are ideal for finding gas - rich dwarf companion galaxies , but large volumes near target galaxies have hitherto not been surveyed since hiobservations that are both wide - field and sensitive have been too expensive in observing time . the new parkes multibeam receiver @xcite however , with its narrowband filters @xcite , offers the opportunity to efficiently image nearby galaxies and their environments at unprecedented brightness sensitivity and velocity resolution , with moderate spatial resolution .    to date",

    "stars in the disk of have ages as young as , and a halo of stars with ages exceeding has been observed @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with models of lsb galaxies which exhibit star formation rates that are on average low but erratic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since these galaxies evolve slowly , the surrounds of may be relatively rich in agglomerations of hi  whose densities have not reached those required for star formation , and which have not yet settled into the disk of the galaxy .",
    "already , one possible companion to is known : the ( hereafter , antlia ) , at a distance of from the milky way @xcite .",
    "like , antlia contains stellar populations of all ages @xcite , with most recent star formation taking place slowly in the central regions @xcite . in this respect , it is typical of the dwarf spheroidals in the local group ( e.g.  tucana , carina ) .",

    "the spectrum of hi  emission integrated spatially over is shown in .",
    "the overall profile shape is markedly asymmetric , having a surplus of flux in the lower velocity component of the disk .",

    "the line centre is located at , being the coincident midpoint of the and peak flux points on the edges of the profile .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with all previously published values , e.g.   measured by @xcite and measured by @xcite .",
    "the flux - weighted mean velocity is , and the peak flux is detected at .",
    "the peak projected rotation velocity of the galaxy is .",
    "the integrated hi  flux of , measured by the traditional zeroth - order moment of the spectrum , and verified with an equivalent but robust statistic , is ; the uncertainty in this value is dominated by the uncertainty in the image beam ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this value compares well to measured from standard hipass data , and is also recovered when the narrowband spectral data is re - imaged in the traditional way ( i.e.   with a gaussian smoothing kernel and using the mean estimator instead of the median ) .",
    "compared to the spectrum published by @xcite , from which an integrated hi  flux of is measured , we detect substantially more flux in at all velocities .",
    "this is expected , since @xcite used the very large array ( vla ) in a configuration blind to emission on scales much greater than on the sky .",
    "of the many single dish studies made of , the flux measured here is consistent only with the value , measured by @xcite with the harvard 60-ft antenna , whose beam is sufficiently large to `` see '' all of .",
    "other single dish measurements , viz .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , were made using larger telescopes , and we suggest that these measurements have been compromised by large scale insensitivity .",
    "we deduce an hi  mass for of @xmath7@xmath1 , not corrected for hi  line opacity . this is lower than most previously determined values for the following reasons",
    ": there has been a general trend towards lower distance estimates to in the more recent literature ; the majority of previous hi  flux measurements seem too high as described above ; no correction of hi   optical depth has been made in this work .",
    "the synthesis hi  mass of @xcite , corrected for the recent ( lower ) distance measures to , is @xmath8@xmath1 .",
    "thus the hi   mass not detected by the vla observations is of order @xmath9@xmath1 .    in , integrated hi  column density and flux - weighted velocity maps of",
    "are given .",
    "a warp in the column density and velocity field is evident in the south west of the galaxy .",
    "inspection of individual channel maps demonstrates that this component is the source of the asymmetry in the ( single dish ) integrated hi   profile of the galaxy , and that it contains a substantial fraction of the neutral gas not seen by the vla , in the form of a smooth , extended component near velocity .",
    "we note that this reservoir of gas lies in that part of velocity space which coincides with the radial velocity of antlia .",
    "this will be discussed further below .",
    "the field imaged by our observations measures square at a distance of .",
    "as expected , the antlia dwarf galaxy was detected , and its hi  parameters are presented below . besides and antlia , eight previously catalogued galaxies were detected in the field , at radial velocities between and .",
    "data pertaining to these galaxies  including the hi  properties measured in this survey  are given in .",
    "two of the galaxies  and  have previously been identified as members of the galaxy group @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of and of the remaining hi  galaxies in the field range places them at least behind and antlia , allowing us to conclude that it is highly unlikely that they have exerted any influence on the formation or evolution of .      the hi  emission spectrum extracted at the position of the antlia dwarf galaxy and integrated over a region @xmath10 , is shown in .",
    "the galaxy is easily detected , and is well distinguished from emission .",
    "the spectrum is that of a single peak profile with a maximum flux of at . the peak flux measured here is consistent with the previously determined upper limits of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the line centre is measured to be , this being the mean of the midpoints of the and peak flux points on the edges of the profile , in exact agreement with the detection by @xcite , and coinciding with the flux - weighted mean velocity .",
    "the velocity width is .",
    "we note that the detection by @xcite is almost certainly real , contrary to the suggestion of @xcite that it is an instrumental artifact .",
    "summing the flux in the hi  profile of antlia yields a total flux of . under the usual assumptions , and adopting a distance of to antlia , this yields an hi   mass of @xmath11@xmath1 .",
    "our result is considerably lower than that of @xcite , who used the data of @xcite to determine a total hi  mass of antlia of order @xmath12@xmath1 , and lies within the range of hi  contents detected in dwarf spheroidal galaxies by @xcite .",
    "moment analysis applied to the hi  spectrum of antlia yields a line - of - sight rms velocity of . following @xcite , a central mass - to - light ratio of @xmath13",
    "is calculated for antlia .",
    "for a point source at the distance of , the minimum detectable hi  mass ( 3@xmath14 per channel ) is of order @xmath15@xmath1 where @xmath16 is the velocity width of the galaxy expressed in .",
    "we have neglected the improvement in detectability as source width increases , and so the antlia dwarf galaxy , which extends over more than 30 channels , actually lies slightly below this limit . for a smooth distribution of hi  filling the beam ,",
    "the minimum detectable column density for these observations is @xmath17@xmath18 ( 3@xmath14 , per channel ) .",
    "such a gas cloud would have a neutral gas mass similar to that calculated for the point source case .",
    "in the cube of space centred on , with sidelength , we have detected only one dwarf galaxy  antlia .",
    "no other isolated reservoirs of neutral gas were found , and so at this point little can be deduced about the dark matter content of and its surrounds . to escape detection , a gas cloud in the vicinity of could be :      objects in the first category are exceedingly difficult to detect without committing substantial telescope time , and even then will likely be invisible in hi  emission given the typical column density cutoff seen in galaxy disks at @xmath21@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such objects must surely exist as a component of the ly alpha absorber population .",
    "dwarf galaxies bound to will primarily fall into the second and third categories .",
    "further hi  imaging at higher spatial resolution can be used to search for gas clouds unresolved from ( category three ) , but the parkes multibeam remains the best instrument for finding the low hi  mass objects of category two .",
    "our findings are consistent with other recent searches for extremely low hi  mass objects . for example",
    ", the arecibo hi  strip survey of @xcite yielded an hi  mass function predicting a number density of for objects having hi  masses in the decade @xmath22  @xmath23@xmath1 .",
    "this gives a detection probability of for a single object in this mass range in the present study of .",
    "the warp of the gas disk of detected here is also suggested in the data of @xcite .",
    "their shows a narrow plume of low column density gas extending southwest from the disk .",
    "our observations suggest that the gas plume is sitting on top of a more massive but smooth distribution of hi  which is invisible to the synthesis observations .",
    "@xcite note that the hi  plume , together with the slight southwest displacement of the optical isophotes , is suggestive of a past interaction with another system , yet are unable to suggest a suitable nearby system .",
    "since the plume ( or warp ) lies at exactly the radial velocity of antlia , we speculate that antlia is this very companion , and that some mild interaction has occurred between and antlia in the distant past .    for a current separation of , and a differential velocity of , an interaction may have taken place ago .",
    "the encounter would need to have been prolonged enough to draw out a substantial mass of neutral gas ( of order @xmath24@xmath1 ) but mild so as not to cause massive star formation  the plume is presently undetected optically .",
    "recent n - body simulations of the milky way and magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that such encounters can occur .",
    "further n - body simuiations of the and antlia system are needed to assess whether this proposed past encounter is feasible .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the parkes observatory  in particular john reynolds and mal smith  for their expert assistance during the observations .",
    "we are also grateful for the continuing support of the livedata software by mark calabretta and lister staveley - smith of the australia telescope national facility .",
