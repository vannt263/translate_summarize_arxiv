    "eddy currents play a crucial role in magnetic induction tomography ( mit ) @xcite , in non - destructive testing @xcite , and in different versions of contactless flow measurements for liquid metals as , for example , in contactless inductive flow tomography ( cift ) @xcite , in induction flow - metering based on phase shift measurements @xcite , and in lorentz force velocimetry @xcite . usually , the eddy currents in the bulk material are indirectly inferred from non - invasive measurements of external induced magnetic fields .",
    "the final inverse problem of inferring the material inhomogeneities or flow velocities from the induced magnetic fields is still a formidable task .    in many cases",
    ", it would be desirable to have independent eddy current measurements in order to validate numerical solvers for the forward and the inverse problem . for evident reasons ,",
    "a detailed eddy current measurement in solid materials is hardly possible .",
    "up to present , only some eddy current measurements at the surface of thin solid aluminum plates were reported @xcite and served for the validation of a numerical benchmark problem .",
    "in contrast to solid metals , liquid metals are perfectly suited for a full scan of the eddy current distribution in the bulk of the conducting material .",
    "actually , various liquid metals ( mercury @xcite , wood s metal @xcite ) have been used already in eddy current testing since they allow an easy defect modelling . however , to the best of our knowledge , in this paper we present the first spatio - temporal measurements of eddy currents in a liquid metal alloy ( gainsn ) both for the case of harmonic excitation and for the case of a pulsed ( transient ) excitation .",
    "whereas harmonic excitations have been used for long in non - destructive testing , the transient excitation has achieved much attention only during the last ten years .",
    "nowadays it is used for non - destructive testing in many areas , including the detection of corrosion and cracks in aging aircrafts fleets @xcite .    in order to start with an accurate reference model , we determine harmonic and transient eddy currents in a cylindrical vessel which is large compared to the radius and the distance of the exciting cylindrical coil .",
    "this problem can be reasonably approximated by the eddy current problem in a conducting half - space for which analytical solutions are known , both in the harmonic and in the transient case @xcite .",
    "another measurement is carried out for the more complicated situation that a non - conducting torus with quadratic cross - section is immersed into the liquid metal .",
    "these measurements are then compared with numerical results from the commercial fem software opera .",
    "the paper closes with a summary and some conclusions .",
    "consider a conducting half - space with conductivity @xmath0 and a coil of radius @xmath1 located at a distance @xmath2 to the boundary of the half - space ( figure 1 ) .",
    "independent of the time - dependence of the exciting current , the eddy currents in the half - space will only have an axisymmetric azimuthal component @xmath3 .",
    "first we consider a harmonic current @xmath4 in the coil with amplitude @xmath5 and angular frequency @xmath6 . in @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of the eddy current density @xmath7 in the conducting half - space was shown to have the form @xmath8 where the abbreviation @xmath9 is used .",
    "@xmath10 is the bessel function of order 1 and @xmath11 is the magnetic permeability of the free space ( throughout the paper we assume the relative magnetic permeability @xmath12 to be equal to 1 ) .    for each point @xmath13 the integral ( 1 ) can be easily evaluated .",
    "typically , we have used discretizations with 50 - 200 points in the @xmath14 space , and we have carefully checked the convergence of the integration procedure .",
    "now let us assume that the current in the excitation coil is suddenly switched on so that it corresponds to a step function @xmath15 .",
    "quite similar to the harmonic case , the induced transient eddy current density @xmath16 can be represented as an integral over the wave number @xmath14 : @xmath17 with @xmath10 being again the bessel function of order 1 and @xmath18 being defined as @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\frac{e^{\\displaystyle -\\frac{k^2 t}{\\mu_0 \\sigma}}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\sigma } } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the results of equation ( 1 ) for the harmonic case and of equations ( 3,4 ) for the transient case will be visualized in the following section where we will compare them with the measured current distribution .",
    "in addition to the analytical expressions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , we also determine the eddy current by the commercial fem package opera .",
    "opera is a finite element analysis software for time varying electromagnetic fields .",
    "it includes a module for solving eddy current problems in which the exciting currents can vary sinusoidally or in another predetermined way in time .",
    "the measurement principle for the eddy currents relies on ohm s law in non - moving conductors which connects the electric current density @xmath20 with the electric field @xmath21 via @xmath22 .",
    "the measured voltage @xmath23 between two points @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be expressed by the line integral over the electric field @xmath26 .",
    "the only current component that appears in our particular problem is the azimuthal one which can be determined by the voltage between two electrodes whose difference vector points in azimuthal direction . at every instant @xmath27 and every position @xmath13",
    ", this azimuthal current density @xmath7 can be approximated by @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the distance between the electrodes .",
    "the value of @xmath29 chosen in the experiment results as a compromise between maximizing the measurable voltage and minimizing the inaccuracies which appear in particular for small radii @xmath30 .",

    "is fitted ( least - squares - method ) to the data .",
    "the resulting parameters @xmath34 are the basis for spatial amplitude and phase plots . ]     mm , @xmath31 mm .",
    "the stem - plots in ( b ) indicate the instants for which the eddy current distribution will be shown in detail . ]",
    "the experimental set - up is shown in .",
    "the central part is a cylindrical glass vessel ( 1 ) filled with the eutectic alloy ga@xmath35in@xmath36sn@xmath37 , which has the advantage of being liquid down to temperatures of about @xmath38 .",
    "the physical properties of gainsn at 25 @xmath39c are : density @xmath40 kg / m@xmath41 , kinematic viscosity @xmath42 m@xmath43/s , electrical conductivity @xmath44 ( @xmath45 m)@xmath46 . the non - conducting ring ( 3 ) is immersed into the liquid only in the second part of the experiment and is held by one stainless steel rod ( @xmath47 mm , @xmath48 s / m ) which we assume to be non - essential for the current distribution .",
    "the external magnetic field is generated by a circular coil ( 2 ) , centered below the vessel ( 1 ) .",
    "this coil consists of 63 turns of a 0.6 mm cu wire and is wound in such a way that the coil has a nearly circular cross - section .",
    "the coil is fed by a precise u - i - converter ( hero pa2024c ) controlled by an arbitrary - waveform generator ( ad - win - pro ) . in the case of harmonic excitation ,",
    "a current of 1 a amplitude and a frequency of 480 hz was applied to the coil ( see a ) . in the case of transient excitation",
    ", the limited bandwidth of the amplifier requires that the pulse - edges have to be approximated by a continuous function . for this purpose , the 1st quarter - period of @xmath49 with @xmath50 a and @xmath51 khz was chosen . the resulting rise time ( see ) of @xmath52 @xmath53s is small compared to the typical diffusion time of the magnetic field @xmath54 ms .",
    "the pulse duration was set to @xmath55 ms , to avoid interactions between the eddy currents resulting from the rising and the falling edge .",
    "the pause between the pulses was set to @xmath56 ms .",
    "this rather long time is necessary to avoid a significant heating of the coil .",
    "the spatio - temporal distribution of the induced eddy current is determined by pointwise measuring the voltage drop @xmath33 between the blank ends of two coated wires ( 0.1 mm cu - wire ) which are twisted to avoid inductive pick - up ( r.h.s . of ) .",
    "the connecting line between the points @xmath57 points in azimuthal direction .",
    "the wires are guided through a thin glass pipette ( 4 ) into the medium . in the top - view of the probe ( 5 ) the electrode distance @xmath58",
    "mm is visible .",
    "after differential amplification ( @xmath59 db ) and low - pass filtering ( @xmath60 khz ) the signal is routed directly into a digital storage oscilloscope ( tektronix tds3034b ) , which records the response with a sample - rate of 2.5 megasamples / s over 10 kilosamples . due to the signal decrease with respect to the coil - probe - distance , the vertical - sensitivity of the oscilloscope is adapted to exploit its dynamic range as good as possible .",
    "the entire signal path is realized as a dc - measurement to get correct transients . to specify the exact position @xmath61 of the potential probe",
    ", the pipette is mounted onto a three - axis traversing robot .",
    "the @xmath62-axis is required to make measurements even behind the immersed ring ( 3 ) by rotating the probe between 0@xmath63 and 180@xmath63 . in order not to deform or crash",
    "the probe , a safety distance of 1 mm to the vessel and to the ring has been chosen .",
    "the extension of the scan - region ( 7 ) , as well as the spatial resolution ( 6 ) are the same for all arrangements to get comparable results . in the present case a step size of @xmath64 mm is applied which leads to a raster - size of @xmath65 pixels .",
    "thus a measurement time of about 2 hours is necessary to traverse through the whole scan region .",
    "the eddy current signal is logged pointwise to a pc which also controls the traversing robot and the waveform generator .",
    "the final eddy current distribution is determined in the post - processing . in the case of harmonic excitation",
    "the measured voltages @xmath66 are fitted by a sine function with the amplitude @xmath67 and the phase @xmath68 ( see ) . for transient excitation ,",
    "time - slicing through the acquired data results in @xmath69 for each instant ( see ) .",
    "both fields @xmath70 are converted from voltage to current by equation . to illustrate and compare the measured versus calculated distributions",
    "the computation of isolines was performed .",
    "the required software was developed under usage of matlab ( mathworks inc . ) .",
    "in this section we compare the measured eddy currents with the analytical results ( in the case of homogeneous fluid ) and with numerical results ( in the case of an immersed torus ) . it should be noted that the specified lengths in @xmath13 direction refers to @xmath71 ( cp .",
    "figure 2 ) .",
    "hence , the shown r - axis is located 1 mm above the boundary of the half space .",
    "we start with the case of a homogeneous fluid for which analytical solutions for the harmonic and transient excitation were given in section 2 .      in the case of harmonic oscillation",
    "we show both the amplitude and the phase shift of the induced currents for a frequency of 480 hz ( figure 5 ) .    ]",
    "( a ) and phase - angle [ @xmath63 ] ( b ) of the azimuthal eddy current in the case of harmonic excitation with a frequency of 480 hz and an excitation current of 1 a. ]    in addition to the measured values , we show also the results of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "actually , we have also computed the eddy current by the commercial fem code opera . however , in the adopted spatial resolution the results are indistinguishable from the analytical ones . in general , we see a good correspondence of experimental and theoretical data which expectedly gets worse for smaller radii where the finite distance ( 6 mm ) of the two electrodes of the potential probe makes a precise measurement of the azimuthal currents impossible .      in figure 6",
    "we present the measured and the theoretical eddy current distribution for the case of pulsed excitation for the time instants 200 , 600 , 1000 and 1400 @xmath53s .",
    "these instants were already indicated as circles in the lower panel of figure 4 .",
    "again , we observe a good correspondence , despite the used approximations with respect to geometry and to the pulse shape .    ] in the case of pulsed excitation with an excitation current of 5 a. ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) correspond to time instants , 200 , 600 , 1000 , and 1400 @xmath53s , respectively . which were marked in .",
    "]    it might also be instructive to compare the time evolution of the total currents which is the integral in @xmath30 and @xmath73 direction of the eddy current density ( figure 7 ) . in a wide range of the time evolution ,",
    "the misfit between the two data is of the order of a few percent . only at the very",
    "beginning and at the end ( when the measured signal is already very small ) , we get a discrepancy of around 10 per cent .          in order to study a slightly more complicated problem which is not solvable anymore by an analytical expression ,",
    "we have immersed a pvc torus into the liquid metal .",
    "this problem has been solved again by means of the commercial fem solver opera which , in the case of a homogeneous fluid , had provided results more or less identical to the analytical one . note that a similar transient eddy current analysis was recently published @xcite .      in figure 8 ,",
    "we show again the amplitude and the phase shift of the induced currents for a excitation frequency of 480 hz . the stronger deviation to the case of a homogeneous fluid are detected for the phase , while the amplitude is rather unaffected by the insertion of the torus .    ]",
    "( a ) and phase - angle [ @xmath63 ] ( b ) of the azimuthal eddy current in the case of harmonic excitation with a frequency of 480 hz and an excitation current of 1 a. ]      in figure 9 we present again the measured and computed eddy current distribution for the case of pulsed excitation for the time instants 200 , 600 , 1000 and 1400 @xmath53s .",
    "s , respectively . ]",
    "the deviation of the measured total current from the numerically obtained one ( figure 10 ) is a bit larger in this case , which might be due to the technical problems to measure the current close the inserted pvc ring .",
    "we have measured the two - dimensional , axi - symmetric distribution of eddy currents in a liquid metal arising from harmonic or pulsed excitations in a nearby coil . in both cases ,",
    "the measured values show a satisfactory agreement with the analytical solution of the corresponding problem for a conducting half - space .",
    "expectedly , a non - conducting torus immersed into the fluid disturbs the eddy current distribution , which was also confirmed by means of a commercial numerical solver ( opera ) .",
    "although we have restricted our interest to axi - symmetric problems in which the only relevant current component is the azimuthal one , the method can easily be generalized to fully three - dimensional scans of all three eddy current components .",
    "this way , it might help to validate numerical models for non - destructive testing and magnetic inductance tomography .",
