    "theoretical developments and novel experiments in the area of ferroelectrics have rapidly evolved over the last ten years , allowing further progress in the understanding of this remarkable phenomenon . in particular ,  nanoscale \" ferroelectrics have attracted considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "the question of the existence of a critical thickness , in other words whether or not ferroelectricity can be maintained at reduced dimensions , is amongst the most exciting topics of the field today , with very active experimental  @xcite and theoretical efforts  @xcite .",
    "probing ferroelectricity in thin films and nanostructures is a difficult task , which requires advanced techniques . among these ,",
    "scanning probe characterization based on piezoelectric microscopy has allowed a ferroelectric ground state to be identified down to 40   in thin pb(zr@xmath1ti@xmath2)o@xmath0 films  @xcite , and x - ray studies on pbtio@xmath0 films suggested that 28   films are ferroelectric  @xcite .",
    "dielectric and pyroelectric response measurements have allowed ferroelectricity to be identified in polymer films down to 10   ( two unit cells )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ultrahigh vacuum scanning probe characterization based on electrostatic force microscopy was used to study ferroelectricity in barium titanate nanowires with diameters as small as 10 nm  @xcite .",
    "on insulating substrates , lateral periodicity was observed via x - ray diffraction in thin pbtio@xmath0 films down to 12   and attributed to alternately polarized domains  @xcite . in all these studies , however , properties _ averaged _ over the complete ferroelectric structure were measured and no _ local _ information on the atomic displacements was obtained .",
    "in contrast , the photoemission based photoelectron diffraction ( xpd ) used in our study presents two interesting characteristics : it is naturally surface sensitive , due to an electron escape depth of approximately 20   ( at the energy used here ) ; and atomic displacements within the unit cell can be directly probed , allowing the non - centro - symmetric and tetragonal nature of the crystal lattice to be directly demonstrated .",
    "this turns out to be crucial for studying ultrathin films , and for discriminating the behavior of the surface from that of the body of the film .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "the ferroelectric phase is characterized by a non - centro - symmetric structure where the o and ti atoms are unequally shifted with respect to pb . in a unit cell with the polar c - axis along the @xmath4-direction , o and ti move either upwards or downwards ( with a larger o displacement ) resulting respectively in a ",

    "density functional theory calculations  @xcite were performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) using the abinit  @xcite package .",

    "[ despontfig2](d ) ) .",
    "insulating srtio@xmath0 was considered in our simulations since nb doping is not presently affordable at the first - principles level  @xcite . to reproduce the substrate clamping effect ,",
    "the in - plane lattice constant was fixed to the relaxed a - axis value of bulk",
    "srtio@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the atomic positions were then relaxed until the maximum residual atomic force was smaller than 40 mev /  .",
    "our calculations were restricted to @xmath9 surface periodicity and did not allow for an eventual antiferrodistortive ( afd ) @xmath10 reconstruction  @xcite .",

    "because of the typical lda underestimate of the lattice constant  @xcite , the values are given as a percentage of @xmath11 .",
    "the magnitudes of the ferroelectric and surface relaxation effects can now be compared .",
    "first , the cation - oxygen displacements due to ferroelectricity ( 11.6% - 8.3% of @xmath11 , fig .  [ despontfig2](b ) ) are significantly larger than the displacements due to surface relaxation / rumpling ( 3.4% - 1.4% of @xmath11 , fig .  [ despontfig2 ] ( c ) and 3.3% - 1.5% of @xmath11 , fig .  [ despontfig2](d ) ) .",

    "third , the surface relaxation and rumpling effects are globally unaffected by the film thickness ( figs .",
    "[ despontfig2 ] , ( c ) and ( d ) ) and their amplitude decays very quickly in the interior of the film : they are already negligible two unit cells below the surface .",
    "this implies that the xpd measurements will be probing both the narrow relaxed surface region and a few unit cells below , essentially not affected by the surface relaxation .",
    "the samples used in this study are epitaxial , c - axis oriented pbtio@xmath0 thin films grown on conducting ( 001 ) nb - srtio@xmath0 substrates using off - axis radio - frequency magnetron sputtering  @xcite .",
    "topographic measurements using atomic force microscopy ( afm ) showed that these films are essentially atomically smooth , with a root - mean - square roughness between 2 and 6   over a 10 @xmath1210 @xmath13m@xmath14 area .",
    "room temperature x - ray diffraction measurements , for films with thickness @xmath15 28  allowed us to precisely determine the thickness and the c - axis parameter of the films , and to confirm their epitaxial  cube - on - cube \" growth .    after growth and characterization , the films were transferred _",

    "the xpd measurement system comprises a hemispherical electron energy analyzer with a three - channel detector , an x - ray photon source with two possible energies ( @xmath16 = 1253.6 ev and 1740 ev for mgk@xmath17 and sik@xmath17 radiation , respectively ) , and a computer - controlled two - axis goniometer capable of rotating the photoelectron emission angle over the full hemisphere above the surface  @xcite .",
    "the local geometry around a selected atom can be probed by performing an intensity versus emission - angle scan of a chosen photoemission line . because of the chemical sensitivity of photoemission , a given atom type is then chosen by selecting one of its core levels .",
    "the outgoing photoemitted electrons exhibit a strongly anisotropic angular intensity distribution .",
    "this angular distribution is due to the interference of the directly emitted photoelectron wave with the scattered electron waves .",
    "the analysis of the interference ( or diffraction ) patterns is facilitated by the so - called  forward focusing \" effect taking place for photoelectron kinetic energies greater than @xmath18 0.5 kev . when considering a row of atoms , scattering at the first few atoms along this row",
    "focuses the electron flux in the emitter - scatterer direction ( for a review see ref .",
    "this enhancement of the intensity in the emitter - scatterer direction is schematically illustrated by the green curve in fig .",
    "[ despontfig1](a ) ( right part ) for the centro - symmetric  para \"- state ( continuous line ) and the  up \"- state ( dotted line ) .",
    "the forward focusing effect is further amplified for electron scattering by heavy atoms . in a semi - classical picture this can be understood as the focusing of the electron wave by the high number of protons in high atomic number atoms  @xcite .",
    "note that , despite the forward focusing effect , the experimentally measured angles are sensitive to multiple interferences , refraction and possible anisotropic atom vibrations at the surface . in the present case of pbtio@xmath0 ,",
    "pb scattering is highly dominant compared to the scattering by other elements  @xcite . as a first step , in order to probe the non - centro - symmetry , o was chosen as emitter - atom ( o 1s core level , e@xmath19 = 724.1 ev ) , since it has the largest displacement  @xcite and has pb scatterers as nearest neighbors ( see fig .  [ despontfig3 ] ) . however , the o contribution from the nb - srtio@xmath5 substrate becomes non - negligible for films thinner than the photoelectron inelastic mean free path , making the study of films thinner than 20 more difficult . as a second step , in order to probe the tetragonality of the films , i. e. , the @xmath20 ratio of the pb lattice ( related to the polarization via the polarization - strain coupling as discussed below and in details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , pb was chosen as emitter - atom ( pb 4f@xmath21 core level , e@xmath19 = 1115.5 ev ) , and pb - pb forward focusing directions were used . since pb atoms are absent from the substrate , this study can be done down to a monolayer of ferroelectric material .      first , considering oxygen as the emitter atom , fully automated computer code for calculating electron diffraction in atomic clusters ( edac ) via multiple scattering  @xcite , based on the muffin - tin potential approximation  @xcite was used to calculate the xpd pattern .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) shows four o 1s core level emission ( e@xmath19 = 724.1 ev ) interference patterns .",
    "one is the measurement made on a 20   thin film while the three others are multiple scattering edac calculations of the ",
    "up\"- ,  down\"- and  para \"- state .",
    "intensities are plotted in a stereographic projection with the center corresponding to normal emission ( polar angle @xmath22 ) and the outer border corresponding to grazing emission ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the strongest intensities ( surrounded by red ellipses ) correspond to the scattering of o 1s photoelectrons by pb nearest neighbours ( see fig .  [ despontfig3](b ) ) .",
    "the white circle is a guide to the eye indicating the polar angle of maximum intensity for the measured interference pattern .",
    "it is evident that the polar angle position of this peak , which is directly linked to the o - pb directions , is perfectly reproduced by the  up \"- state calculation while the  para\"- and the  down \"- state simulations predict a different position .",
    "the  up \"- state ( down - shifted o position ) corresponds to a smaller polar emission angle ( @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](b ) ) appearing closer to normal emission ( center of the interference pattern in fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) ) .",
    "such measurements have also been performed on films with thicknesses of @xmath25 500 , 200 , 100 , 60 , 44 and 28  , and all perfectly reflect the characteristics of the  up \"- state . domains in our films can be ruled out from the xpd measurement because the two characteristic  up \" and  down \"- state  forward focusing \" peaks are not observed simultaneously in the experimental diffractogram , fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) .",
    "this contrasts with the results of fong et al .",
    "@xcite on a insulating substrates . ]    these conclusions , drawn from visual inspection of the interference patterns locally around the intensity maximum ( fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) ) , are confirmed by a global matching approach using a reliability ( r)-factor to evaluate the quality of the fit between the complete experimental interference pattern data and theory ( fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](b ) ) . the c - axis lattice constant value and the o and ti shifts are the adjustable structural parameters .",
    "a cut in the ( 100 ) plane , containing pb and o atoms , is shown to facilitate the discussion . in the calculation ,",
    "o and ti atoms are moved together and the dipole is continuously changed from the  down \"- state to the  up \"- state , crossing over the  para \"- state .",
    "the best fit corresponds to the minimal r - factor value , which is reached when o and ti atoms are shifted below the centro - symmetric position ( parameters used for the  up \"- state simulation in fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) ) , with an r - factor value of @xmath18 0.34 . in comparison , for the same c - axis parameter but the opposite o and ti atom shifts ( parameters used for the  down \"- state simulation in fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) ) , the calculation gives a much higher r - factor of @xmath26 .",
    "in between ( zero o shift ) , in the centro - symmetric  para \"- state , the r - factor is @xmath27 ( parameters used for the  para \"- state simulation in fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) ) .",
    "it is important to note that surface relaxation and rumpling , neglected here , can not weaken our conclusions ; indeed they would give a picture resembling a  down \"- state , the corresponding o - pb atoms being shifted in the opposite direction than what is observed ( see fig .",
    "[ despontfig2](c ) ) .",
    "also , the possibility of a surface afd reconstruction was explored without finding evidence for it in our room temperature experiments .",
    "this r - factor analysis therefore quantitatively confirms the observations made in fig .",
    "[ despontfig3](a ) , namely that the measured interference pattern is best simulated with the  up\"- state .",
    "this demonstrates unambiguously that , for a film as thin as 20  the o atoms have a non - centro - symmetric position in the pb cage corresponding to a non - vanishing spontaneous polarization .",
    "let us emphasize that piezoelectric afm measurements performed after the xpd experiments on the thickest films ( @xmath25 500  ) confirmed the uniformup \"- state polarization while a uniform  down \"- state polarization had been initially found for the same films just after growth .",
    "this confirms the _ monodomain _ character of the as grown sample and also indicates that the films are uniformly switched from  down \" to  up \"- state by exposure to our conventional x - ray source , attesting for the switchable character of the polarization .",
    "the details behind the switching are presently not known , but we believe that it occurs at the initial stage of the experiment while the measurement itself is essentially done in zero field .",
    "in fact , our results do not depend on the x - ray intensity , proving that the films are in equilibrium state during the measurements . as discussed below",
    ", the agreement between the tetragonality deduced from x - ray diffraction and xpd also suggests that the measurements are performed in similar conditions .      in a second step , considering pb as the emitter atom",
    ", xpd was used to determine the tetragonality . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , below 200   the tetragonality decreases as the film thickness decreases .",
    "this decrease is a consequence of the strong polarization - strain coupling in pbtio@xmath0 and a signature of a reduced polarization in thin films . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this polarization reduction was attributed to imperfect screening of the depolarizing field  @xcite . with xpd , using pb as emitter , the tetragonality was measured down to the unit cell level as shown in fig .",
    "[ despontfig4 ] .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath20 , deduced from the forward focusing angles , are particulary large .",
    "this might reflect a strong enhancement of the polarization in the probed surface region ( of the order of @xmath28 for @xmath29 , from the pto polarization - strain coupling ) , even larger than in the theoretical prediction of ref .",
    "however , as previously stated , we are not necessarily measuring the precise atom - atom directions and the anomalously large forward focusing @xmath20 might also be related to other effects ( anisotropic atom vibrations at the surface , refraction and multiple scattering interferences ) .",
    "therefore a comparison with x - ray diffraction ( xrd )  @xcite must be done at the relative level ( fig .",
    "[ despontfig4 ] , left and right scale ) .    to study the evolution of the tetragonality as a function of the film thickness ,",
    "the measured xpd values are compared to the @xmath20 values obtained by xrd .",
    "the xpd measurement on fig .",
    "[ despontfig4 ] confirms the evolution of c / a obtained from x - ray measurements in ref .",
    "@xcite and agrees with the theoretical prediction ( dashed curve ) relying on the suppression of polarization due to imperfect screening of the depolarizing field  @xcite . the similar thickness dependence for the xpd ( very surface sensitive ) and the x - ray measurements ( average on the whole film ) implies that the polarization evolves at the surface in the same way as at the interior of the film and that there is no thick paraelectric dead layer at the surface . in addition",
    ", the xpd tetragonality measurement shows a continuous decrease of tetragonality down to the thickness of one unit cell  @xcite .",
    "two ribbons are drawn in fig .",
    "[ despontfig4 ] , labeled with 1 and 2 .",
    "they indicate the regions within which @xmath20 values of 1.03 and 1.01 are crossed with respect to both c / a scales . for film thicknesses above two unit cells ,",
    "the @xmath20 values are larger than 1.03 , the value expected at the bulk level for the paraelectric phase ( resulting from the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate , see also fig .",
    "[ despontfig2](a ) ) .",
    "this observation directly implies , via the polarization - strain coupling , that the films still have a finite -although progressively reduced- spontaneous polarization . at thicknesses of one or two unit cells , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ despontfig4 ] , c / a drops even more , reaching a value close to 1.01 for the one unit cell thick film  @xcite .",
    "this further decrease highlights that macroscopic elasticity no longer applies at such thicknesses where the interlayer atomic distances are affected by surface relaxation and rumpling as shown by the _ ab - initio _ calculations ( fig .",
    "[ despontfig2](d ) ) .",
    "the measured tetragonality agrees with the computed value of 1.01 for the one unit - cell thick relaxed paraelectric film suggesting the absence of any additional ferroelectric distortion at this thickness .",
    "this study thus directly demonstrates non - centro - symmetry , unambiguously a result of ferroelectricity in pbtio@xmath0 thin films down to 20  .",
    "the measurements of the tetragonality , with a continuous decrease down to the bare substrate , show that even extremely thin films ( 3 unit cells ) have a @xmath20 value larger than 1.03 , attesting for the presence of a non - vanishing spontaneous polarization at this thickness scale . as the film thickness is reduced to a single unit cell",
    ", the experiments , together with calculations , strongly suggest that both non - centro - symmetry and tetragonality are governed by surface effects , giving rise for our geometry to a polar relaxed structure but without switchable ferroelectric distortion .",
