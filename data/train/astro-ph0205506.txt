    "a number of the satellite galaxies of the milky way are distorted , in some cases dramatically ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , by the tidal interactions with the galaxy .",
    "the obvious manifestations of tidal distortion are streams of material that are liberated by tidal forces to lead or trail the satellite in its orbit .",
    "one might also expect the tide to stretch the satellites gravitational potential wells along the radial direction , and hence induce a tendency for the bound parts of satellite galaxies to be extended toward their primaries . since our vantage point precludes a measurement of the satellites extent along the galactic radius vector ,",
    "it is not possible to test this hypothesis for the milky way satellites . given a large sample of satellites around other galaxies , however , we can test whether the ( projected ) satellite major axes have a tendency to be circumferential or radial rather than randomly oriented .    while a detection of satellite shape alignments would serve as a crude gauge of the effect of tidal forces on satellite morphologies",
    ", it would be a significant nuisance for measurements of galaxy masses using weak gravitational lensing .",
    "in such studies , the halo mass distribution of the primary ( foreground ) galaxy is inferred by measuring the slight tendency toward circumferential alignment that the gravitational lensing distortion of the primary galaxy induces upon the images of distant background galaxies .",
    "this `` galaxy - galaxy lensing '' signal was first proposed and sought by @xcite and tentatively detected by @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been detected at high significance by @xcite , @xcite[sm01 ] , and @xcite[mck01 ] .",
    "the latter two studies use foreground galaxies with redshifts measured by the las campanas @xcite and sloan @xcite redshift surveys , respectively , and are able to determine the halo masses as a function of luminosity and morphological type .",
    "such information is extremely valuable  but subject to error if the measured mean circumferential ellipticities are due to intrinsic alignments of the primaries satellites rather than by the lensing effect . in galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements to date , there has been no attempt to cull the satellites from the sample of lensed background galaxies .    in this work",
    "we test for shape alignment among a sample of satellites of isolated galaxies found in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , in an effort to see if such alignments are a significant difficulty for galaxy - galaxy lensing studies .",
    "the following sections describe the satellite sample ; the determination of their mean elongations ; and the implications for weak lensing studies and for tidal effects . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath2 , @xmath3 cosmology to convert redshift into comoving distance and we assume the value of the hubble constant to be @xmath4 .",
    "the sample of satellite galaxies around isolated primaries is obtained from the 2dfgrs dataset as of december 2001 . the details of how we identify the satellites and primaries within the survey and the tests on the robustness on the method used",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "however in order to be complete , we briefly repeat the steps of this satellite selection scheme below , which follows the one developed by @xcite .",
    "the criteria for isolation of the primary galaxy are more relaxed in this work than for studies of satellite galaxy dynamics . using the full 2dfgrs redshift catalogue containing over 200,000 galaxies , we first select regions of sufficiently high redshift completeness .",
    "we then loop over all galaxies which are at least 2.2 magnitudes brighter than the magnitude limit of the 2dfgrs , and localize the galaxies which are isolated .",
    "a bright galaxy is isolated and considered as a primary if all its neighbouring galaxies with @xmath5 km / s and within a projected distance @xmath6  are such that @xmath7    finally all galaxies around a primary which are within a projected distance @xmath6  and with relative velocity @xmath8 km / s are considered as detected satellites around bright isolated galaxies .",
    "only galaxies with a good redshift measurement will be taken up in our catalogue of primaries and satellite galaxies .",
    "we also make sure , by using the full photometric 2dfgrs catalogue , that no bright galaxy without redshift measurement lies within the projected radius of an isolated primary . in other words ,",
    "we eliminate any source of contamination due to spectroscopic determination failure .",
    "we note here that the minimum required magnitude difference between primaries and satellites is about the same as the typical foreground / background magnitude difference in the sm01 and mck01 lensing studies .",
    "this selection makes this satellite sample particularly appropriate for determination of the lensing contamination .",
    "however , we have to point out that for most primaries we have only detected one or two satellite galaxies , this mainly being due to the limiting depth of the 2dfgrs , of typically b@xmath9=19.45 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "only 12 primaries in our catalogue of 1227 primaries have 6 or more galaxy satellites around them , and we have also detected 5886 primaries without any spectroscopically confirmed satellite galaxy .",
    "shapes for all satellites are taken from the apm scans of photographic survey plates @xcite .",
    "we rotate the apm - determined shapes into a coordinate system with the @xmath10 axis along the radius vector from primary to secondary .",
    "there result two ellipticity components which are defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the quadratic central moments of the galaxy intensity integrated within a bounding isophote .",
    "figure  [ e1e2 ] illustrates the meaning of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we expect a tidal effect to be manifested as non - zero @xmath15",
    ". the mean @xmath14 must be zero if the universe has inversion symmetry , hence we can use @xmath14 as a test for systematic errors .",
    "the unweighted isophotal moments produced by the apm software are noisier and more difficult to correct for point - spread - function ( psf ) distortions than more recently devised ellipticity estimators .",
    "the satellites are , however , all at least 1 mag above the @xmath16 limit of the apm catalog , and should hence have fairly high signal - to - noise and be well resolved in the apm images .",
    "in fact we make no correction at all for psf effects .",
    "crudely , the measured ellipticity @xmath17 will be related to the true image ellipticity @xmath18 and the psf ellipticity @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ratio of the intensity - weighted moment @xmath22 of the psf to that of the measured image . in our application ,",
    "the second term has no effect , since @xmath23 if the psf orientation has no correlation with the primary - satellite vector .",
    "we can estimate the effect of the circularization factor @xmath24 in the first term by noting that the _ measured _ satellite shapes have @xmath25 .",
    "this measured value will be a factor @xmath26 smaller than the _ intrinsic _ @xmath27 of the population .",
    "@xcite[bj02 ] find the rms intrinsic ellipticity of high - surface - brightness galaxies in the nearby universe to be 0.30 .",
    "if the intrinsic shapes of satellite are similar to those of high - surface - brightness galaxies in an apparent - magnitude - limited sample , then the circularization factor @xmath24 is unity to within 10% or so .",
    "bj02 find an rms ellipticity of 0.48 for the lowest - surface - brightness subset of nearby galaxies .",
    "if the satellites have this intrinsic dispersion , then @xmath28 but the higher shape dispersion of low - surface - brightness galaxies is due to a preponderance of disk galaxies , which should be largely absent from the satellite sample .",
    "this prejudice is reinforced by the observation that the distribution function for @xmath29 values for the satellites is very similar to bj02 s distribution function for high - surface - brightness galaxies ( their figure  4 ) .",
    "it therefore seems more likely that there is negligible psf circularization in the apm ellipticities , so we will not make any correction for the @xmath30 term .    as a further check on the possibility of psf circularization , we split the satellite galaxies into a bright half ( @xmath31 ) and faint half ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the brighter half is presumably nearer and better resolved than the fainter half , so a substantial circularization effect would be manifested as a lower rms ellipticity for the fainter half .",
    "the rms ellipticities @xmath33 of the brighter and fainter subsamples are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the circularization of the fainter half is hence a @xmath36 effect ; the fainter galaxies could also just be intrinsically rounder .",
    "an unweighted average of the 1819 satellite ellipticities yields @xmath37    in the weak lensing measurements , one ideally weights low-@xmath38 galaxies more heavily as they offer better sensitivity to lensing shear .",
    "such a weighted average is not justified in considering the effect of tidal forces on intrinsic satellite shapes .",
    "it is , however , relevant for assessing the contamination of weak lensing data by satellite alignments since the lensing data are weighted .",
    "following bj02 , we apply a weight @xmath39 to each satellite . in these scheme",
    "we obtain @xmath40    there is clearly no significant detection of net satellite alignment , in either component , and the @xmath14 values show that our uncertainties are sensible .    as illustrated in figure  [ runave ] , no alignment is detected even when we restrict the sample to the smaller projected radii where tidal effects should be stronger .",
    "we have also tested for alignment in the half of the galaxies that have primaries brighter than @xmath41 .",
    "the unweighted mean @xmath42 , a @xmath43 signal , but the weighted mean is only @xmath44 non - zero and there is no detection of real significance . further restricting the sample to small projected radii",
    "does not increase the measured mean .",
    "equations  ( [ emean ] ) indicate that , for satellites within @xmath0  projected radius , the mean radial or circumferential elongation is less than 2% in projection at 95% confidence .",
    "we wish to place some bound on the three - dimensional satellite shapes from the limit on the projected shape .",
    "we now define a parameter @xmath45 that characterizes the mean departure of satellite shapes from spherical symmetry .",
    "we place a cartesian coordinate system on each satellite such that the @xmath10 axis is along the primary - satellite radius vector , and the @xmath46 axis is perpendicular to both the line of sight and the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the luminosity distribution of each satellite has second central moments @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in this system . because the ensemble of primary - satellite systems must be isotropic with respect to the line of sight",
    ", the mean transverse moments must satisfy @xmath50 .",
    "we can then quantify the mean tidal distortion by defining @xmath51 and @xmath45 such that @xmath52 a positive value of @xmath45 would indicate the presence of a radial elongation from tidal effects .",
    "it is also possible that a nonzero @xmath45 could arise if satellites tend to be found along and align with the dark matter filaments that are believed to underly the large - scale distribution of galaxies .",
    "we are not aware of any theoretical estimates of the size ( or sign ! ) expected of such an effect .    if there is no absorption in the galaxy , then the mean _ projected _ second moments can be simply related to the intrinsic elongation @xmath45 via @xmath53 we may thus bound the mean radial asymmetry of satellites to be @xmath54 at 95% cl .",
    "equations  ( [ ewt ] ) imply that the population of satellites will produce a false lensing distortion of @xmath55 at 95% cl .",
    "f00 measure the angular correlation between foreground and `` background '' samples and infer that the pollution of the `` background '' sample by neighbors of the foreground galaxy_i.e .",
    "_ satellites  is about 15% within impact parameters of 60  .",
    "the contamination in sm01 is significantly lower , 10% at most .",
    "hence the deleterious effect of satellite alignment will be significantly diluted at these radii , and will be even weaker at larger radii . for the sm01 data , we may conclude that the false distortion signal produced by aligned satellites satisfies @xmath56 at @xmath57 confidence within 60  impact parameter .",
    "since sm01 detect a mean distortion of @xmath58 at this impact parameter around an @xmath59 galaxy at @xmath60 , the error due to satellite alignments is at most a 20% effect .",
    "we can not yet conclude that the effect is totally negligible , but this is likely the case , especially at larger impact parameters , where the satellite fraction is smaller , and the tidal effect drops more rapidly than the lensing shear .",
    "larger and deeper satellite samples containing more primaries with many satellite galaxies each may reveal a significant alignment , and future galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements will be aiming for higher precision .",
    "if the satellite alignments do ultimately pose a barrier to high precision , then their deleterious effect could be eliminated by using photometric redshift estimates to exclude the bulk of the satellite population from the sample of lensed background galaxies .",
    "satellite alignments do not , however , seem to be a problem for current galaxy - galaxy lensing data .",
    "we are grateful to the 2dfgrs team for allowing us to use their data prior to publication and to carlos frenk for useful discussions .",
    "the 2dfgrs is being carried out using the 2 degree field facility on the 3.9 m angloaustralian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "we thank all those involved in the smooth running and continued success of the 2df and the aat .",
