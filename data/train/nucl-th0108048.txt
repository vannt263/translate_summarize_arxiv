    "in a previous work , two of us argued that the mean transverse momenta measured in relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be described by the intrinsic transverse momentum broadening seen at the tevatron for @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "the mean transverse momenta of charged and identified hadrons increases universally with the square root of the multiplicity per unit transverse area for both @xmath0 and aa collisions .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the total hadron multiplicity follows a scaling behavior motivated by the gluon saturation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we try to combine these two ideas in a consistent picture of transverse mass distributions of identified particles as a function of centrality . to do this",
    ", we apply theoretical ideas emerging in the color glass condensate description of the high gluon density phase of qcd .",
    "specifically , we describe the transverse momentum spectra using the recently measured data from bnl s relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) for auau collisions at @xmath1 agev .",
    "the theoretical motivation for such scaling relations is as follows . at very high energies",
    ", the number of partons ( primarily gluons ) in a nucleus grows very rapidly .",
    "when the occupation number of these partons is large , they saturate  @xcite and form a novel state of matter called a color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the cgc has a bulk scale @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) which is the typical intrinsic transverse momentum of the saturated gluons in the nucleus .",
    "the cgc can be probed in deeply inelastic scattering  @xcite , in photoproduction in peripheral heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , in pa collisions  @xcite and in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "we remark , that scaling analysis of the transverse mass spectra at rhic has been also pursued in @xcite although within a different physical picture .",
    "collisions of heavy - ions at high energies can be imagined as the collision of two sheets of colored glass , and a large multiplicity of gluons is produced . since the occupation number of the gluons in each of the colliding nuclei is large , the problem can be treated classically  @xcite .",
    "the only dimensionful quantities available to describe the collision are a ) the transverse area of the two colliding nuclei @xmath5 and b ) the saturation scale @xmath6 we mentioned previously , which is determined by the density of partons in the transverse plane .",
    "this saturation scale is a function of both energy and centrality .",
    "all dimensionful quantities can therefore be expressed in terms of powers of one or the other scale times non  perturbative functions of the dimensionless product of the two scales .",
    "the initial momentum distribution of produced gluons in high - energy collisions is then found to be given by the relation  @xcite @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is a universal , dimensionless function for the produced gluons which depends only on the ratio of the transverse momentum and the saturation momentum .",
    "different energies or scales are described by the same function with a correspondingly changed saturation momentum @xmath2 .    motivated by the above relation , we want to test in this paper how well these scaling relations describe the actual data , i.e.  the momentum distribution of produced hadrons .",
    "ab initio , it is not obvious that there is such a relation as hadrons are produced nonperturbatively at the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "there is also surely some transverse flow of the matter produced in these collisions and it is not clear to what degree this flow might distort the distributions produced early in the cgc .",
    "also , hard processes are expected to modify the scaling relations at sufficiently high transverse momenta above the saturation scale @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles are well described as a function only of the transverse mass @xmath9 .",
    "this appears to be a good approximation so long as we are not too close to the mass of the particle in question .",
    "( at small values of @xmath10 we expect flow effects to be important which will invalidate this simple @xmath4 scaling form of the distributions . )",
    "we therefore parameterize the transverse momentum spectra as @xmath11 the universal function @xmath12 depends on @xmath4 and the corresponding saturation scale for hadrons @xmath13 and incorporates @xmath4-scaling .",
    "the constant @xmath14 reflects the difference in abundances of various species of particles , and is of order one for the particles which we consider .",
    "we take it to be independent of @xmath13 . the hadron saturation momentum @xmath13 as well as @xmath5 are parameters which are determined by the energy and centrality of the collision .",
    "we assume @xmath13 to have the same energy and centrality dependence as the saturation momentum @xmath2 . also , the function @xmath12 has to be extracted from the data .",
    "but once the universal function @xmath12 is fixed for one data set , it should describe the other data by rescaling the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the scaling relation implies that there is one and only one function which describes high - energy collisions at various centralities , energy and system size .",
    "this picture can certainly be valid only in some range of these parameters .",
    "it is the purpose of this investigation to determine how well scaling works for data from relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we turn now to a more detailed discussion of the transverse momentum distribution focusing on identified hadron spectra as measured recently at rhic in auau collisions with @xmath1 agev @xcite . note that in relation ( [ eq : scaling_mt ] )",
    "all hadrons are described by only one function of the transverse mass @xmath15 .",
    "the transverse mass is just the total transverse kinetic energy carried by that hadron . plotting the transverse mass spectra for identified hadrons as a function of @xmath4 ( not as a function of @xmath16 ) should then result in one single curve .",
    "this idea is not particularly new .",
    "it is similar to the @xmath4-scaling behavior put forward by hagedorn for @xmath17 collisions in his statistical model @xcite .",
    "the universal function in the hagedorn model is then a bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution and depends on one parameter , the slope parameter @xmath18 .",
    "contrary to this picture , we approach the problem in reverse and try to determine the universal function from the experimental data .    the transverse momentum spectra of pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons have been reported by the phenix collaboration at rhic to quite large transverse momenta @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "for the first time in hadronic collisions , one sees that the protons and antiprotons seem to be more abundant at higher transverse momentum @xmath19 gev than pions .",
    "the slope of the transverse momentum spectra for protons and antiprotons is apparently much larger than that of the pions , so that the nucleon spectra overshoots the pion spectra at some @xmath19 gev .    the scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling_mt ] )",
    "can now be tested by plotting the transverse mass spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : mt_minbias ] shows the preliminary minimum bias data of the phenix collaboration for charged pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons @xcite and for neutral pions @xcite as a function of @xmath4 ( not @xmath10 ) . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_minbias ] , the data points for all hadrons seem to follow one curve over several orders of magnitude for a broad range of transverse mass .",
    "the neutral pion data is on top of the antiproton data within the error bars . but one notices also , that the curves for kaons and protons are shifted downwards and upwards , respectively .",
    "these are effects due to quantum numbers ( strangeness and baryon number ) which are not taken into account in the scaling relation .",
    "the production of strange particles is suppressed due to the strange quark mass , while the number of protons is enhanced due to the initial baryon number excess coming from the two colliding nuclei .",
    "interestingly the proton - antiproton pair production seems to be not suppressed relative to pion production but kaon production is .",
    "we note that these changes are moderate , they shift the curves of the kaons down by about a factor two while shifting the proton curve up by about a factor two from the universal curve .",
    "these shifts correspond to the constant @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ eq : scaling_mt ] . shifting the kaon and the proton spectra by these factors results in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_minbias_scaled ] .",
    "now all the data points are lying on one curve .",
    "it tells us that the shape of the spectra for the same value of @xmath4 are equal for pions , kaons , and nucleons .",
    "( often times , a slope parameter is extracted to characterize spectra .",
    "this is extracted from the spectra close to the mass threshold , i.e.  at @xmath20 .",
    "the larger the mass of the hadron @xmath21 the larger will be its slope parameter @xmath18 , as the slope of the transverse mass spectra is increasing with @xmath4 .",
    "we can read from fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_minbias_scaled ] , that this effect will also continue for heavier particles but it is less pronounced as the slope of the curve levels off . )",
    "if scaling works for all particles , the transverse mass distribution of hyperons will then follow also the same universal @xmath4-curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_minbias_scaled ] modulo shape independent effects from baryon and strangeness number conservation which affect only the overall normalization of the distribution .    being more quantitative , the transverse mass spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_minbias_scaled ] can be fitted by a power law of the form @xmath22 with the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 gev .",
    "we remark that the values for @xmath25 and @xmath13 are strongly correlated , fits with different values for @xmath13 and properly adjusted @xmath25 gives an equally good fit to the data points .",
    "the values for @xmath25 and @xmath13 are constrained in such a way that they get about the same mean transverse mass of @xmath26 for each fit .",
    "let us define now the local slope as @xmath27 then we find that the local slope parameter for a power - law distribution in @xmath4 is given by @xmath28 i.e.  a constant term plus a term linear in the transverse mass . the constant is closely related to the mean transverse mass . the correction term proportional to the transverse mass originates from the non - exponential behavior of the power - law distribution which enhances the high-@xmath4 part of the distribution . with the fitted parameters given above",
    ", we find the following slope parameters for various hadrons at @xmath20 : 175 mev ( @xmath29 ) , 196 mev ( k ) , 224 mev ( p ) , 235 mev ( @xmath30 ) , 247 mev ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the actual measured values for @xmath29 , @xmath32 and nucleons are higher @xcite as the experimental fits are taken around @xmath33 gev above the threshold .",
    "hence , the apparently different slopes for hadrons can be also explained by a generalized @xmath4-scaling of the transverse mass spectra .",
    "note , that the relation ( [ eq : tslope ] ) is similar to the one derived for radial flow of non - relativistic particles @xmath34 @xcite . in @xmath17 collisions , the value for @xmath13 is smaller than in @xmath35 collisions , so that the deviations from an exponential shape of the transverse mass distribution are less pronounced .",
    "therefore , one recovers in @xmath17 collisions the traditional @xmath4-scaling behavior of hagedorn s statistical model @xcite with about similar slope parameters for all hadrons .",
    "we will discuss the centrality dependence below in more detail .",
    "we remark that the universal @xmath4-scaling seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_minbias ] does not rule out radial flow because at large momenta the hydro picture also predicts a universal curve for all hadrons .",
    "a clear indication of radial flow would be a deviation from the @xmath4-scaling curve .",
    "these deviations should be especially pronounced for heavier hadrons .",
    "star measures at even lower @xmath10 than phenix and reports a larger slope parameter for antiprotons than phenix @xcite .",
    "this experimental finding can not be explained by generalized @xmath4-scaling .",
    "the flatter distribution at small @xmath4 close to @xmath21 compared to larger @xmath4 can be well described in hydrodynamical models with collective transverse flow @xcite . in general",
    ", radial flow implies a violation of @xmath4 scaling , as the transverse momentum distribution then depends then on both , @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "we expect that there should be radial flow effects in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these should show up in a relatively unambiguous way as the deviations from @xmath4 scaling for @xmath4 near threshold .",
    "what we try to describe in this paper are the gross features of the data for @xmath4 far from threshold .",
    "the consistency of the picture we present is simple within the color glass condensate framework .",
    "it may turn out for reasons which we do not understand that radial flow preserves these simple patterns .",
    "for example , this might be plausible if the flow sets in very early in the collision .",
    "it might also turn out that the patterns we observe have some as yet undiscovered interpretation .",
    "the scaling relations we present nevertheless would remain as a simple phenomenological description of the data .",
    "finally , we note that the universal @xmath4-scaling for hadrons in heavy - ion collisions has been also observed at lower bombarding energies at cern s sps @xcite but it has not been discussed in detail . in particular , no interpretation in terms of scaling has been given .",
    "the scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling_mt ] ) predicts more than the universal curve for the transverse mass spectra . as it should be valid for all centralities , the transverse mass spectra should scale for each centrality class .",
    "moreover , there is only one scaling function and the transverse mass spectra for different centralities can then be rescaled into each other by properly choosing the transverse area @xmath5 and the momentum @xmath13 for each centrality bin .    the first statement is probed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_centrality ] which shows the preliminary @xmath4-spectra of phenix for negatively charged pions and antiprotons for different centralities @xcite .",
    "indeed , it seems that there is a universal function for each centrality bin , even for the most peripheral one , which describes the pion and antiproton spectra simultaneously .",
    "the form of the curves looks similar for the various centralities , too .    to check that the @xmath4 distribution is universal , we rescale the data points in absolute normalization and in transverse mass : @xmath36 so that the data points for all centralities are lying on top of each other .",
    "we choose the most central bin as a reference curve .",
    "the scaling parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are extracted for each centrality bin .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath37 is just @xmath39 for a given centrality relative to the value for the most central bin .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is the momentum @xmath13 for a given centrality bin divided by the one for the most central bin .",
    "technically , we use the @xmath10-spectra of charged particles as measured by the phenix collaboration @xcite to fix the scaling parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 for each centrality bin as the data has much better statistics .",
    "then we use those parameters to rescale the @xmath4 distributions .",
    "[ fig : mt_scaling ] shows the rescaled version of the transverse mass spectra for all centralities .",
    "the data points for all centralities are now lying on top of each other , i.e.  scaling works reasonably well also for the centrality dependence of the @xmath4-spectra . accordingly",
    ", also the charged particle @xmath10 spectra then can be rescaled for each centrality cut .",
    "there seem to be deviations from scaling at large @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_scaling ] as that the more central bins are suppressed relative to the peripheral ones . but within the error bars it is difficult to make a more definite conclusion .",
    "we see a similar trend at high @xmath10 for the rescaled charged particle spectra , but again within the error bars it is hard to draw a conclusion .",
    "one expects that @xmath40 rescales as a product of the transverse area times a logarithmic function of the centrality .",
    "similarly , one expects @xmath41 to scale as the cube root of the centrality . in the following",
    "we will check , if this is the case .      the fitted scaling factor @xmath39 for the different centrality bins are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_area ] versus the number of participants @xmath42 .",
    "we take the number of participants as reported by the phenix collaboration in @xcite for their centrality cuts .",
    "the scaling factors are given relative to the one for the most central bin at @xmath43 .",
    "one sees from the figure , that the fitted scaling factors seems to have a more linear dependence on @xmath42 than to follow the curve for a transverse area @xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a correction factor coming from @xmath45 . the quantity @xmath46 is taken as @xmath47 and the saturation momentum is dependent on the number of participants @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath46 induces then a logarithmic correction to the scaling factor .",
    "the scaling factor should then follow a curve proportional to the transverse area @xmath48 divided by @xmath46 which is of the form @xmath49 . for consistency ,",
    "the argument of the logarithm is taken from the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath42 as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the dependence of @xmath50 with @xmath42 has been fitted to be @xmath51 ( see figure [ fig : scaling_ps ] ) and @xmath52 is the momentum scale for the most central bin .",
    "the dependence of @xmath46 with @xmath13 is then of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ratio of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and adjusted to be 0.6 .",
    "the corresponding curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_area ] by the solid line and now follows very closely the extracted values for the scaling factor .",
    "the second scaling factor , @xmath13 , as extracted from the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_ps ] .",
    "again , the factors are normalized to the one for the most central bin .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath13 is quite weak for moderate to large number of participants but falls off for peripheral collisions .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath13 are compared with the expected behavior for the saturation momentum @xmath57 in the figure .",
    "it is seen , that @xmath13 changes less rapidly with centrality than @xmath58 .",
    "the reason is that the gluon densities at hand are still too small to reach this behavior fully .",
    "fits of the form @xmath59 describe the centrality dependence of @xmath13 much better ( see figure and the previous discussion in section [ sec : scalinga ] ) .",
    "hence , as @xmath13 increases it appears to be tending towards the scaling with @xmath60 .",
    "let us compare @xmath13 to the mean transverse momentum defined by @xmath61 where @xmath21 is the vacuum mass of the identified hadron and @xmath62 is some function of the ratio of the hadron mass and the scaling momentum .",
    "the momentum @xmath13 is proportional to the mean @xmath10 . in the limit @xmath63 one",
    "should recover the mean @xmath10 and its corresponding momentum @xmath13 of @xmath17 collisions .",
    "the constant seen in the fit of @xmath13 with @xmath42 then stands for that finite mean @xmath10 ( or @xmath13 ) already present in @xmath17 collisions .",
    "note , that @xmath13 is not directly identical with the mean @xmath10 but differs by the factor @xmath62 . as this factor",
    "@xmath62 depends on the vacuum mass of the hadron , the mean @xmath10 for each hadron follows a different behavior with centrality which depends on the ratio of its vacuum mass to the momentum @xmath13 in a nontrivial way .",
    "the weak centrality dependence of @xmath13 is compatible with the small change of the mean @xmath10 with @xmath42 seen at rhic @xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath10 for charged particles measured in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath64 gev has been measured by the ua1 collaboration to be @xmath65 mev @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the mean @xmath10 for @xmath0 collisions is known to be quite weak .",
    "star reports preliminarily that @xmath66 mev for central auau collisions at @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "so , the ratio of mean @xmath10 squared for @xmath63 to the value for central auau collisions , i.e.  the value for @xmath50 at @xmath67 , is calculated to be 0.60 which is in agreement with the results of fig .  [",
    "fig : scaling_ps ] .    the centrality dependence for @xmath13",
    "can be compared to the measured transverse energy per charged particle by the phenix collaboration @xcite which is approximately proportional to the mean transverse momentum .",
