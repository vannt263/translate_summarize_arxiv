    "many of our basic conceptions about the nature of physical reality inevitably turn out to have been false , as novel empirical evidence is obtained , or paradoxical implications stemming from those concepts are eventually realised .",
    "this was expressed well by einstein , who wrote @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what is essential , which is based solely on accidents of development?  concepts that have proven useful in the order of things , easily attain such an authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable facts.the path of scientific advance is often made impassable for a long time through such errors .",

    "but since our sense - perceptions inform us only indirectly of this external world , or physical reality , it is only by speculation that it can become comprehensible to us . from this",
    "it follows that our conceptions of physical reality can never be definitive ; we must always be ready to alter them , to alter , that is , the axiomatic basis of physics , in order to take account of the facts of perception with the greatest possible logical completeness . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",

    "the essay will concentrate initially on the nature of cosmic expansion , which lacks an explanation in the standard cosmological model . through a discussion of the early developments in cosmology",
    ", a familiarity with the pioneering conception of expansion , as being always driven by a cosmological constant @xmath0 , will be developed , upon which basis it will be argued that the standard model  which can not reconcile with this view  affords only a very limited description .",
    "then , the nature of time in relativistic cosmology will be addressed , particularly with regard to the formulation of ` weyl s postulate ' of a cosmic rest - frame",
    ". the aim will therefore be towards a better explanation of cosmic expansion in general , along with the present acceleration that has recently become evident , by reconceiving the description of time in standard cosmology , as an approach to resolving this significant shortcoming of the big bang friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models , and particularly the flat @xmath0cdm model that describes the data so well .",
    "the expansion of our universe was first evidenced by redshift measurements of spiral nebulae , after the task of measuring their radial velocities was initiated in 1912 by slipher ; and shortly thereafter , de  sitter attempted the first relativistic interpretation of the observed shifts , noting that ` the frequency of light - vibrations diminishes with increasing distance from the origin of co - ordinates ' due to the coefficient of the time - coordinate in his solution @xcite . but the concept of an expanding universe , filled with island galaxies that would all appear to be receding from any given location at rates increasing with distance , was yet to fully form .    for one thing ,",
    "when de  sitter published his paper , he was able to quote only three reliable radial velocity measurements , which gave merely @xmath1 odds in favour of his prediction .",
    "however , in 1923 eddington produced an updated analysis of de  sitter space , and showed that the redshift de  sitter had predicted as a phenomenon of his statical geometry was in fact due to a cosmical repulsion brought in by the @xmath0-term , which would cause inertial particles to all recede exponentially from any one @xcite .",
    "he used this result to support an argument for a truly expanding universe , which would expand everywhere and at all times due to @xmath0 .",
    "this , he supported with an updated list of redshifts from slipher , which now gave @xmath2 odds in favour of the expansion scenario .    that same year , weyl published a third appendix to his _ raum , zeit , materie _ , and an accompanying paper @xcite , where he calculated the redshift for the ` de  sitter cosmology ' , @xmath3 the explicit form of which would only be found later , independently by lematre @xcite and robertson @xcite .",
    "weyl was as interested in the potential relevance of de  sitter s solution for an expanding cosmology as eddington @xcite , and had indeed been confused when he received a postcard from einstein later that year ( einstein archives : [ 24 - 81.00 ] ) , stating ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ with reference to the cosmological problem , i am not of your opinion .",
    "following de  sitter , we know that two sufficiently separate material points are accelerated from one another . if there is no quasi - static world , then away with the cosmological term .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    eight days after this was posted , einstein s famous second note @xcite on friedman s paper , which he now referred to as ` correct and clarifying ' , arrived at _ zeitschrift fr physik_. einstein evidently had in mind that the cosmic expansion can be described with @xmath0 set to zero in friedman s solution , and he might have thought weyl would notice @xcite and make the connection  but the latter evidently did not , as he wrote a dialogue the following year @xcite in which the proponent of orthodox relativity eventually states , ` if the cosmological term fails to help with leading through to mach s principle , then i consider it to be generally useless , and am for the return to the elementary cosmology'that being a particular foliation of minkowski space , which , of the three cosmological models known to weyl , was the only one with vanishing @xmath0 .    at this point in the dialogue , the protagonist paulus perseveres , citing the evidence for an expanding universe , and therefore the de  sitter cosmology as the most likely of the three known alternatives .",
    "weyl s excitement over its description is evident in paulus final statement : ` if i think about how , on the de  sitter hyperboloid the world lines of a star system with a common asymptote rise up from the infinite past [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : ds_lr ] ] , then i would like to say : the world is born from the eternal repose of ` father ther ' ; but once disturbed by the ` spirit of unrest ' ( _ hlderlin _ ) , which is at home in the agent of matter , ` in the breast of the earth and man ' , it will never come again to rest . ' indeed , as eq .",
    "( [ ds_lr ] ) indicates , and as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds_lr ] , the universe emerges from a single point at @xmath4 , even though slices of constant cosmic time are infinitely extended thereafter  and comoving geodesics _ naturally _ disperse throughout the course of cosmic time .",
    "thus , we have a sense of the concept of cosmic expansion that was common amongst the main thinkers in cosmology in the 1920s , who were considering the possibility of expansion driven by the cosmical repulsion in de  sitter space .",
    "indeed , hubble was aware of this concept , as he wrote of the ` de  sitter effect ' when he published his confirmation of cosmic expansion in 1929 @xcite ; and de  sitter himself , in 1930 , wrote of @xmath0 as ` a measure of the inherent expanding force of the universe ' @xcite .",
    "thus , along with the evidence that our universe actually _ does _ expand , one had in - hand the description of a well - defined force to _ always _ drive that expansion .",
    "it was therefore a huge blow to eddington , e.g. , when in 1932 einstein and de  sitter @xcite finally rejected that interpretation of cosmic expansion , in favour of a model that could afford no prior explanation for _ why _ the universe _ should _ expand .",
    "as he put it @xcite ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the theory recently suggested by einstein and de  sitter , that in the beginning all the matter created was projected with a radial motion so as to disperse even faster than the present rate of dispersal of galaxies , leaves me cold .",
    "one can not deny the possibility , but it is difficult to see what mental satisfaction such a theory is supposed to afford . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    to see why the big bang flrw models with matter provide no explanation of expansion , for the reason stated by eddington , we need only look at friedman s equation , @xmath5 which describes the dependence of the scale - factor , @xmath6 , on @xmath0 and the density , @xmath7 , and pressure , @xmath8 , of matter .",
    "since @xmath9 goes like @xmath10 for radiation or @xmath11 for non - relativistic matter , the _ decelerative _ force due to finite matter - densities blows up exponentially as @xmath12 , while the _ accelerative _ force due to @xmath0 vanishes ; so the ` inherent expanding force of the universe ' only contributes to the expansion of space later on , when the relative contributions of matter and radiation have sufficiently weakened .",
    "therefore , aside from weyl s vacuous de  sitter cosmology , with its big bang singularity at @xmath4 , the big bang flrw models can never _ explain _ the cosmic expansion they describe , which must be caused by the big bang singularity itself  i.e .",
    ", where the theory blows up .",
    "but since the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) indicates that the universe _ did _ begin in a hot dense state at a finite time in the past , the model eddington had favoured instead ( in which an unstable einstein universe that existed since eternity would inevitably begin expanding purely due to @xmath0 @xcite ) also ca nt be accepted .",
    "the principal source of standard cosmology s great _ explanatory deficit _ is the fact that although the non - vacuous big bang flrw models do _ describe _ expanding universes  and in particular the flat @xmath0cdm model describes the observed expansion of our universe very well @xcite ",
    "they afford no reason at all for _ why _ those universes _ should _ expand , since that could only be due to the initial singularity ; i.e. , as we follow the models back in time , looking for a possible cause of expansion , we eventually reach a point where the theory becomes undefined , and call that the cause of it all .",
    "in contrast , i ve discussed two flrw models , neither of which is empirically supported , which would otherwise better _ explain _ the expansion they describe , as the result of a force that is well - defined in theory .    the basic cause and nature of cosmic expansion , along with its recently - observed acceleration ,",
    "are significant problems of the standard model ; so , condisering the evidence that the acceleration is best described by pure @xmath0 @xcite , there is strong motivation to search for an alternative big bang model that would respect the pioneering concept of expansion , as a direct consequence of the ` de  sitter effect ' in the modified einstein field equations .",
    "it is therefore worth investigating the axiomatic basis of the robertson - walker ( rw ) line - element .",
    "as i will eventually argue that the problem lies in the basic assumptions pertaining to the description of cosmic time , i ll begin by discussing some issues related to the problem of accounting for a cosmic present .",
    "the problem of recognising a cosmic present is that , according to relativity theory , it should not be possible to assign one time - coordinate to the four - dimensional continuum of events that could be used to describe objective simultaneity , since two events that are described as simultaneous in one frame of reference will not be described as such by an observer in relative motion .",
    "however , as noted by bondi @xcite ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the newtonian concept of the uniform omnipresent even - flowing time was shown by special relativity to be devoid of physical meaning , but in 1923 h.  weyl suggested that the observed motions of the nebulae showed a regularity which could be interpreted as implying a certain geometrical property of the substratum  .",
    "this in turn implies that it is possible to introduce an omnipresent _ cosmic time _ which has the property of measuring _",
    "proper time _ for every observer moving with the substratum . in other words",

    "so i think that for the present we may base our reasoning upon the following approximative assumption .",
    "there is a system of reference relatively to which matter may be looked upon as being permanently at rest . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    thus , the assumption of a cosmic rest - frame  and a corresponding cosmic time  was justified in the derivation of einstein s ` cylindrical ' model .",
    "while einstein originally proposed this as an ` approximative assumption ' that the empirical evidence seemed to support , the fact that he did restore absolute time when it came to the problem of describing the universe on the largest scale was not lost on his peers .",
    "de  sitter was immediately critical of the absolute time variable in einstein s model , noting that ` such a fundamental difference between the time and the space - coordinates seems to be somewhat contradictory to the complete symmetry of the field - equaitons and the equations of motion ' @xcite .",
    "and a few years later , eddington wrote that an objection to einstein s theory may be urged , since @xcite  absolute space and time are restored for phenomena on a cosmical scale  just as each limited observer has his own particular separation of space and time , so a being coexistive with the world might well have a special separation of space and time natural to him .",
    "it is the time for this being that is here dignified by the title ",
    "absolute. therefore , he concluded , ` some may be inclined to challenge the right of the einstein theory  to be called a relativity theory .",
    "perhaps it has not all the characteristics which have at one time or another been associated with that name  '    indeed , although the assumption of an absolute time in relativistic cosmology is definitely not in the spirit of relativity , the theory is nt fundamentally incompatible with such a definition .",
    "furthermore , it is significant that despite such early criticisms , einstein never wavered in assuming an absolute time when he came to consider the cosmological problem @xcite , i.e. as he always favoured the friedman solutions ( with @xmath13 ) , which begin by postulating the same .",
    "so , we have two opposing descriptions of relativistic time  both of which are principally due to einstein himself!and what i ll now argue is that developments both in cosmology and in our understanding of relativity theory which have taken place in the past century demand the latter  that there is one absolute cosmic time relative to which every observer s proper time will measure , as space - time will be perceived differently due to their absolute motion through the cosmic present that must be uniquely and objectively defined  rather than the former implication of einstein s 1905 theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "in the case of special relativity , a description in which space - time emerges as a clearly defined absolute cosmic present endures , can be realised by considering four - dimensional minkowski space , as a background structure , and a three - dimensional universe that actually flows equably though it  with the past space - time continuum emerging as a purely ideal set of previous occurrences in the universe . then",
    ", if we begin in the cosmic rest - frame , in which fundamental observers world lines will be traced out orthogonal to the cosmic hyperplane , photons can be described as particles that move through that surface at the same rate as cosmic time , thus tracing out invariant null - lines in space - time . in this way , the evolution of separate bodies , all existing in one three - dimensional space , forms a graduating four - dimensional map .",
    "the causal and inertial structures of special relativity are thus reconciled by describing the world lines of all observers in uniform motion through the cosmic present as their proper time axes , and rotating their proper spatial axes accordingly , so that light will be described as moving at the same rate in either direction of proper ` space ' .",
    "and then , so that the speed of photons along invariant null - lines will actually be the same magnitude in all inertial frames , both the proper space and time axes in these local frames must also be scaled hyperbolically relative to each other .",
    "this description of the emergence of space - time in a special relativistic universe can be illustrated in the following way .",
    "consider a barograph , consisting of a pen , attached to a barometer , and a sheet of paper that scrolls under the pen by clockwork .",
    "the apparatus may be oriented so that the paper scrolls downwards , with changes in barometric pressure causing the pen to move purely horizontally .",
    "we restrict the speed of the pen s horizontal motion only so that it must always be less than the rate at which the paper scrolls underneath it .",
    "the trace of the barometric pressure therefore represents the world line of an arbitrarily moving observer in special relativistic space - time , with instantaneous velocity described in this frame by the ratio of its speed through the horizontal cosmic present and the graph paper s vertical speed , with ` speed ' measured in either case relative to the ticking of the clockwork mechanism , which therefore cancels in the ratio .",
    "now , in order to illustrate the relativity of simultaneity , we detach the pen ( call it @xmath14 ) from the barometer so that it remains at rest absolutely , and add another pen , @xmath15 , to the apparatus , at the exact same height , which moves horizontally at a constant rate that s less than the constant rate that the paper scrolls along ; therefore , with _ absolute velocity _ less than the absolute speed limit .",
    "furthermore , we make @xmath14 and @xmath15 ` observers ' , by enabling them to send and receive signals that transmit horizontally at the same rate ( in clockwork time ) as absolute time rolls on ( in clockwork time ) , thus tracing out lines on the graph paper with unit speed .",
    "as this system evolves , the two ` timelike observers ' can send these ` photons ' back and forth while a special relativistic space - time diagram is traced out .",
    "if we d rather plot the map of events in coordinates that give the relevant description from @xmath15 s perspective , we use the lorentz transformation equations corresponding to the description of the map as minkowski space - time : a spacelike line is drawn , tilted from the horizontal towards @xmath15 s world line by the appropriate angle , and the events along that surface are described as synchronous in that frame , even though they take place sequentially in real time . in particular",
    ", at the evolving present , @xmath15 s proper spatial axis extends , in one direction , onto the empty sheet of graph paper in which events have not yet occurred , and , in the other direction , into the past space - time continuum of events that have already been traced onto the paper  while the real present hyperplane , where truly simultaneous events are occurring , is tilted with respect to that axis of relative synchronicity .",
    "the main difference between this interpretation of special relativity and einstein s original one , is that ` simultaneity ' and ` synchronicity ' have objectively different meanings for us , which coincide only in the absolute rest frame  whereas einstein established an ` operational ' concept of simultaneity , so that it would be synonimous with synchronicity , in section 1 , part 1 of his first relativity paper @xcite .",
    "einstein s definition of simultaneity is a basic assumption that s really no less arbitrary than newton s definitions of absolute space , time , and motion ; and , as i ll argue , the evidence from cosmology now stands against einstein s wrong assumption , as it is really more in line with newton s .    the distinction between simultaneity and synchronicity in this different interpretation of relativity , can be understood more clearly through our barograph example , by adding two more ` observers ' , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which remain at rest relative to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 positioned along the same hyperplane as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath17 positioned precisely at the intersection of @xmath16 s world line ( so that the world lines of @xmath16 and @xmath17 exactly coincide , as they are traced out on the space - time graph ) and @xmath15 s proper spatial axis ( therefore , on a different hyperplane than @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) ; thus , @xmath17 shall not be causally connected to @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , since _ by definition _ information can only transmit along the cosmic hyperplane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : elementary cosmology ] .     and",
    "@xmath15 appear to coincide , @xmath18 is disconnected from the causally coherent set , @xmath19.,title=\"fig:\",height=160 ] and @xmath15 appear to coincide , @xmath18 is disconnected from the causally coherent set , @xmath19.,title=\"fig:\",height=160 ]    the significant point that is clearly illustrated through the addition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , is that although in the proper coordinate system of @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 or @xmath18 ) , @xmath18 appears to exist synchronously and at rest relative to @xmath15 , @xmath16which in contrast appears to exist in @xmath15 s ( spacelike separated ) past or future ( depending on the direction of absolute motion ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : elementary cosmology ] @xmath16 appears to exist in @xmath15 s relative past)is really the causally connected neighbour that remains relatively at rest , with which it should be able to synchronise its clock in the usual way ; i.e. , the synchronisation of @xmath15 s and @xmath16 s clocks will be _ wrong _ because _ simultaneous noumena will not be perceived as synchronous phenomena in any but the cosmic rest - frame_.    according to this description , we should have to relinquish the concept that there can be no priviliged observers , as well as einstein s light - postulate in its original form .",
    "with regard to the latter , consider that photons will still be described as travelling at a constant speed in all directions of all reference frames , due to the invariance of null - lines .",
    "but this wo nt actually be true , since an observer moving through the universe will keep pace better with a photon in their direction of motion , and will remain closer to that photon at all later times , on the cosmic hyperplane .",
    "therefore , although light actually wo nt recede as quickly through the universe in the direction of absolute motion , it can always be described as such in the proper coordinate frame because it travels along invariant null - lines .    and with regard to the former concept , it is useful to note galileo s argument that , to a person riding in the cabin of a moving ship , everything inside the cabin should occur just as if the ship were at rest .",
    "it was crucial for galileo to make this point by _ isolating _ the inertial system from its relatively moving surroundings  as the point would have been less clear , e.g. , if he had argued that when riding in the back of a wagon one can toss a ball straight in the air and have it fall back to the same point within the wagon .",
    "however , if one should argue that there _ really _ ca nt be privileged observers in the universe , due to the relativity of inertia , one must go beyond this local - inertial effect ",
    "the relativity of inertia  and consider the frame with respect to its cosmic surroundings  in which case the argument ca nt be justified .    for",
    "consider a neutrino , created in a star shortly after the big bang : in the neutrino s proper frame , only minutes may have elapsed since it left the star , throughout which time the galaxies would have formed , etc .",
    ", all moving past it in roughly the same direction , at nearly the speed of light .",
    "clearly the most reasonable interpretation , however , is that the neutrino has _ really _ been travelling through the universe for the past 13.8 billion years  and this description may be given , with the cosmic present uniquely and objectively defined , in all frames including the neutrino s .",
    "furthermore , if we would assume that there are no privileged observers , it should be noted that the consequence of describing simultaneity and synchronicity as one and the same thing in all frames is a block universe @xcite  a temporally singular ` absolute world ' @xcite in which ` the distinction between past , present , and future has only the significance of a stubborn illusion ' @xcite ; i.e. , ` the objective world simply _ is _ , it does not _",
    "happen_. only to the gaze of my consciousness , crawling upward along the life line of my body , does a section of this world come to life as a fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time ' @xcite ; ` there is no dynamics within space - time itself : nothing ever moves therein ; nothing happens ; nothing changes .",
    " one does not think of particles `` moving through '' space - time , or as ` following along '' their world lines .",
    "rather , particles are just `` in '' space - time , once and for all , and the world line represents , all at once , the complete life history of the particle @xcite .",
    "and so i ve argued against the simultaneity of synchronicity , a reasonably intuitive concept held in common between the theories of both newton and einstein .",
    "but is there any _ sensible _ justification for the concept that the space in which events _ really _ take place simultaneously _",
    "must _ be orthogonal to the proper time - axis of an inertial observer ? when our theories are interpreted in this way , is that because one can , e.g. , sit down on the floor with legs out in front , raise their right arm out to the side and their left arm up in the air , _ and then stick out their tongue in the direction in which time is flowing _ , for them as much as it is for their entire surroundings ?",
    "of course not .",
    "this is no more justified for someone who thus defines a right - handed coordinate system while sitting on solid ground , than it is for a person in the cabin of a ship  whether that is floating on water or flying through space .",
    "therefore , intuition justifies only existence in space that endures with the ticking of everyone s watch  and relativity theory _ demands _ that this can not be both coherently defined and synchronous with every inertial observer !",
    "now , although it may be argued that the alternative assumption of cosmic time is unobservable metaphysics , and therefore unscientific , that simply is nt true  for cosmology does provide strong empirical evidence of an absolute rest - frame in our universe , as follows . as einstein noted already in 1917 @xcite",
    ", there appears to be a frame relative to which the bodies of our universe are at rest , on average .",
    "now , einstein had no idea of the scope of the universe at that time , but already by 1923 weyl realised the significance of this point , which has indeed stood the test of time , when he wrote that @xcite ` both the papers by de  sitter @xcite and eddington @xcite lack this assumption on the `` state of rest '' of stars  by the way the only possible one compatible with the homogeneity of space and time .",
    "without such an assumption nothing can be known about the redshift , of course . ' for it is true , even in de  sitter space , that a cosmic time must be assumed in order to calculate redshifts ; e.g. , for particles in the comoving lematre - robertson frame illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds_lr ] and described by eq .",
    "( [ ds_lr ] ) , the redshift will be different from that in the frame of comoving particles in the three - sphere which contracts to a finite radius and subsequently expands ( as illustrated by the gridlines of the de  sitter hyperboloid in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds_lr ] ) according to @xmath20 where @xmath21 describes the three - sphere .",
    "the existence of more than one formally distinct rw cosmological model in one and the same space - time thus illustrates the importance of defining a cosmic time .    since 1923 , a number of novel observations have strengthened the evidence for a cosmic present , such as hubble s confirmation of cosmic expansion , the detailed measurement of the expansion rate that has lately been afforded through type ia supernovae observations , and the discovery of the cmbr , which gives a detailed signature of the cosmic rest - frame relative to which we are in fact moving , according to the common interpretation of its dipole anisotropy .",
    "thus , the assumption of a cosmic present is now very well justified by empirical evidence .",
    "although many points should be considered in connection to the description of an absolute cosmic present , such as concepts of time travel , free will , and a causally coherent local description of gravitational collapse in the universe  notwithstanding space - time curvature in general , the one consequence that i will note pertains to cosmology , and a better explanation of cosmic expansion .    to start , note that in deriving the general line - element for the background geometry of flrw cosmology , robertson required four basic assumptions @xcite : i.  a congruence of geodesics , ii .",
    "hypersurface orthogonality , iii .  homogeneity , and iv .",
    "i.  and ii .  are required to satisfy weyl s postulate of a causal coherence amongst world lines in the entire universe , by which every single event in the bundle of fundamental world lines is associated with a well - defined three - dimensional set of others with which it ` really ' occurs simultaneously .",
    "however , it seems that ii .",
    "is therefore mostly required to satisfy the concept that synchronous events in a given inertial frame should have occurred simultaneously , against which i ve argued above .    in special relativity ,",
    "if we allow the fundamental world lines to _ set _ the cosmic rest - frame , then the cosmic hyperplane should be orthogonal  but that should nt be the case in general . indeed , as i ve shown in my phd thesis @xcite , in the cosmological schwarzschild - de  sitter ( sds ) solution , @xmath22 for which @xmath23 , @xmath24 is _ timelike _ , and @xmath25 is forever _ spacelike",
    "_ , the @xmath26-coordinate should well describe the cosmic time",
    "_ and _ factor of expansion in a universe in which , in the coordinates carried by fundamental observers , the cosmic present would not be synchronous , and @xmath26 would evolve in proper time @xmath27 as @xmath28,\\label{scalefac}\\ ] ] which is _ incidentally _ also the flat @xmath0cdm scale - factor of the standard model , that s been empirically constrained this past decade @xcite ; see appendix  [ sec_csdscs ] for a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ scalefac ] ) beginning from eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) , and a discussion of the result s connection to cosmology .",
    "this is the rate of expansion that _ all _ observers would measure , if distant galaxies were themselves all roughly at rest with respect to fundamental world lines .",
    "but in contrast to flrw theory , this universe actually has to expand ",
    "at all @xmath24as a result of the ` de  sitter effect ' ; i.e. , if such a universe did come to exist at any infinitesimal time , it would _ necessarily _ expand  and in exactly the manner that we observe  which may be the closest to an explanation of that as we can achieve .",
    "it is , of course , important to stress that this intriguing result is utterly meaningless if simultaneity should rather be defined as synchronicity in a given frame of reference . in that case , as lematre noted @xcite , the solution describes flat spatial slices extending from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , with particles continuously ejected from the origin .",
    "it is therefore only by reconceiving the relativistic concepts of time and simultaneity that sds can be legitimated as a coherent cosmological model with a common origin  and one with the very factor of expansion that we ve measured",
    " which really _ should _ expand , according to the view of expansion as being always driven by @xmath0 .",

    "during the essay contest discussions , the critical remarks on this essay that were most important for me , and were by far the most probing , were those offered by george ellis .",
    "professor ellis criticism of the final section indicated , first of all , that the brief mention i made there of a result from my phd thesis was not developed enough to pique much interest in it  and in fact that , stated as it was there , briefly and out of context of the explicit analysis leading from eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) to ( [ scalefac ] ) , the point was initially lost .",
    "he wrote that the model is ` of course spatially inhomogeneous , ' when the spatial slices _ are _ actually homogeneous , but rather are anisotropic ; and when i pointed out to him that this is so because , in the cosmological form of the sds solution @xmath24 is _ timelike _ and @xmath25 is forever _ spacelike _ , he replied that ` the coordinate notation is very misleading ' .",
    "so , one purpose of this appendix is to provide the intermediate calculation between eqs .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) and ( [ scalefac ] ) , that had to be left out of the original essay due to space limitations  and , in developing a familiarity with the notation i ve used , through this calculation , to ensure that no confusion remains in regard to the use of @xmath26 as a timelike variable and @xmath25 as a spacelike one . for the notation",
    "is necessary both in order to be consistent with every other treatment of the sds metric to date , and because , regardless of whether @xmath26 is timelike or spacelike in eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) , it really does make sense to denote the coordinate with an ` @xmath26 ' because the space - time is isotropic in that direction .    with these `",
    "book keeping ' items out of the way ( after roughly the first four pages ) , the appendix moves on to address professor ellis two more substantial criticisms , i.e.  regarding the spatial anisotropy and the fact that the model has no dynamic matter in it ; for , as he noted , the model ` is interesting geometrically , but it needs supplementation by a dynamic matter and radiation description in order to relate to our cosmic history ' .",
    "these important points were discussed in the contest forum , but were difficult to adequately address in that setting , so the problem is given more proper treatment in the remaining pages of this appendix once the necessary mathematical results are in - hand .",
    "specifically , in the course of developing a physical picture in which the sds metric provides the description of a universe that _ would _ appear isotropic to fundamental observers who measure the same rate of expansion that we do , we ll come to a possible , consistent resolution to the problem of accounting for dynamic matter , which leads to a critical examination of the consistency and justification of some of the most cherished assumptions of modern physics .",
    "we begin by writing down the equations of motion of ` radial ' geodesics in the sds geometry , using them to derive a description of the sds cosmology that would be appropriate to use from the perspective of _ fundamental _ observers who evolve as they do , always essentially _ because of _ the induced field potential .",
    "it will be proved incidentally that the observed cosmological redshifts , in this homogeneous universe which is _ not _ orthogonal to the bundle of fundamental geodesics , must evolve through the course of cosmic time , as a function of the proper time of fundamental observers , with the precise form of the flat @xmath0cdm scale - factor  i.e .",
    ", with exactly the form that s been significantly constrained through observations of type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , and cmbr anisotropies @xcite .",
    "since the lagrangian , @xmath36 for timelike @xmath37-geodesics with proper time @xmath27 in the sds geometry is independent of @xmath25 , the euler - lagrange equations indicate that @xmath38 is conserved ( @xmath39 ) . substituting eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ l_timelike ] ) , then , we find the corresponding equation of motion in @xmath26 : @xmath40 while the value of @xmath41 may be arbitrary , we want a value that distinguishes a particular set of geodesics as those describing particles that are ` fundamentally at rest'i.e . , we ll distinguish a preferred fundamental rest frame by choosing a particular value of @xmath41 that meets certain physical requirements .    to begin",
    ", we first note that where @xmath26 _ is _ spacelike , eq .",
    "( [ rtau ] ) describes the specific ( i.e. , per unit rest - mass ) kinetic energy of a test - particle , as the difference between its ( conserved ) _ specific energy _ and the gravitational field s _ effective potential _",
    "@xmath42 then , it is reasonable to define the fundamental frame as the one in which the movement of particles in @xmath26 and @xmath25 is essentially _ caused _ by the non - trivial field potential  i.e .",
    ", so that @xmath43 just where the gravitational potential is identically trivial ( @xmath44 ) , and the line - element , eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) , reduces to that of minkowski space . from eq .",
    "( [ rtau ] ) , this amounts to setting @xmath45 ; therefore , a value @xmath46 corresponds to a particle that would not come to rest at @xmath47{6m/\\lambda}$ ] , where @xmath44 , but has momentum in @xmath26 beyond that which would be imparted purely by the field .    as a check that the value @xmath45 is consistent with our aims",
    ", we can consider its physical meaning in more detail .",
    "first of all , note that where @xmath44 , at @xmath47{6m/\\lambda}$ ] , @xmath26 is spacelike and @xmath25 is timelike regardless of the values of @xmath48 and @xmath0 ; therefore , it is consistent in any case to say that a particle with @xmath46 woud have non - vanishing spatial momentum there .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , we find that @xmath49 at @xmath47{6m/\\lambda}$ ] just in case @xmath50 , so the sign should in fact be positive for a particle whose proper time increases with increasing @xmath25 in the absence of gravity .",
    "furthermore , note that when @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ rtau ] ) reduces to @xmath51 therefore , misner , thorne and wheeler describe @xmath41 as a particle s ` specific energy at infinity ' , where the effective potential is trivial @xcite .",
    "it s relevant to note their statement ( on p. 658 ) , that the conservation of 4-momentum ` allows and forces one to take over the [ term ] @xmath52``energy at infinity ''  , valid for orbits that do reach to infinity , for an orbit that does not reach to infinity . '",
    "similarly , we should describe @xmath41 for arbitrary @xmath48 and @xmath0 as the ` energy at vanishing field potential ' even when @xmath47{6m/\\lambda}$ ] is a negative mathematical abstraction that lies beyond a singularity at @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , we take @xmath50 to be the specific energy of a test - particle that s at rest with respect to the vanishing of the potential .",
    "it s simply a matter of algebraic consistency .    therefore , we have @xmath50 as the specific energy of particles that would come to rest in the absence of a gravitational field , which are therefore guided purely through the effective field potential .",
    "we therefore use the geodesics with @xmath50 to define a preferred rest frame in the sds geometries  which is particularly relevant to consider in the case of the cosmological sds solution , for which @xmath23and say that any particle whose world line is a geodesic with @xmath53 is one that has uniform momentum relative to the fundamental rest frame .",
    "we can now write the sds line - element , eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) , in the proper rest frame of a bundle of these fundamental geodesics , which evolve through @xmath25 and @xmath26 all with the same proper time , @xmath27 , and occupy constant positions in ` space ' . since @xmath0 must be positive in order to satisfy the requirement @xmath23 for @xmath24 to be timelike ",
    "the requirement that the sds line - element be a cosmological rather than a local solution  it is more convenient to work with scale - invariant parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , etc . , normalising all dimensional quantities by the cosmic length - scale @xmath58 ; see , e.g. ,   66 in @xcite or   4 in @xcite",
    "this ultimately amounts to striking out the factor @xmath59 from the @xmath60-term in the line - element @xmath61 , or e.g.  writing the flat @xmath0cdm scale - factor , eq .",
    "( [ scalefac ] ) , as @xmath62    the evolution of each geodesic through scale - invariant @xmath25 and @xmath26 is then given , through eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) and ( [ rtau ] ) with @xmath50 , as @xmath63 @xmath64 eq .",
    "( [ rdot ] ) can be solved in closed - form using @xmath65 , after substituting @xmath66 . taking the positive root ( so that @xmath27 increases with @xmath26 )",
    ", we have , @xmath67 where the lower limit on @xmath27 has been arbitrarily set to 0 .",
    "thus , in this frame we can express @xmath26 as a function of each observer s proper time @xmath27 and an orthogonal ( i.e. synchronous , with constant @xmath68 ) spatial coordinate , @xmath69 , which may be arbitrarily rescaled without altering the description in any significant way .",
    "then , as long as @xmath48 is nonzero , a convenient set of coordinates from which to proceed results from rescaling the spatial coordinate as , which we are anyhow not interested in .",
    "an equivalent transformation in that case is found by setting @xmath70 , whence @xmath71 , and eqs .",
    "( [ g_chit ] ) , ( [ g_tt ] ) , and ( [ g_chichi ] ) , below , yield the line - element , @xmath72 . ] @xmath73 from which we find , after some rearranging , and @xmath74 , are useful here .",
    "( [ r(tau , xi ) ] ) , along with our eventual line - element , eq .  ( [ sds_proper ] ) , was originally found by lematre @xcite , although his solution to eq .",
    "( [ rdot ] ) ( with dimensionality restored ) , @xmath75,\\ ] ] is too large in its argument by a factor of @xmath76 . ]",
    "@xmath77\\right),\\label{r(tau , xi)}\\ ] ] which immediately shows the usefulness of expressing the arbitrary coordinate @xmath78 in the form written in eq .",
    "( [ r(0 ) ] ) , because it allows eq .",
    "( [ t_int ] ) to be solved explicitly for @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we define a new coordinate @xmath80 , which is orthogonal to @xmath27 and exists on @xmath81 .",
    "this has no effect on the eventual form of the metric we will derive , due to the chain rule , but allows for a neater calculation .",
    "as such , we immediately have the useful result , @xmath82    the transformation , @xmath83 , may then be calculated from @xmath84 furthermore , to solve for @xmath83 , we can gauge the lower limits of the integrals over @xmath25 and @xmath26 , at @xmath68 , by requiring that their difference , defined by @xmath85 sets @xmath86 this calculation is straightforward : ) , since only partial derivatives of @xmath25 are needed here and below . ]",
    "@xmath87 so that @xmath88",
    ".    now , it is a simple matter to work out the remaining metric components as follows : our chosen reference frame immediately requires @xmath89 according to the lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ l_timelike ] ) ; and by direct calculation , we find @xmath90 but this result is independent of the definition of @xmath91 , as explained above ; for if we had followed through with the more general coordinate @xmath78 , we would have found the metric to transform as @xmath92 , the other components remaining the same .",
    "therefore , the sds metric in the proper frame of an observer who is cosmically ` at rest ' , in which the spatial coordinates are required , according to an appropriate definition of @xmath93 , to be orthogonal to @xmath27 , ) is already orthogonal to @xmath27 . ]",
    "can generally be written , @xmath94 this proves lematre s result from 1949 @xcite , that slices @xmath95 are euclidean , with line - element , @xmath96 however , in the course of our derivation we ve also found that lematre s _ physical _ interpretation  that the ` geometry is euclidean on the expanding set of particles which are ejected from the point singularity at the origin'is wrong .",
    "it s _ wrong _ to interpret this solution as describing the evolution of synchronous ` space ' that s truncated at the @xmath29 singularity at @xmath97 , from which particles are continuously ejected as @xmath27 increases  which always extends from @xmath29 to @xmath98 along those lines of constant @xmath27 .",
    "but this is exactly the interpretation one is apt to make , who is accustomed to thinking of synchronous spacelike hypersurfaces as ` space ' that exists ` out there ' , regardless of the space - time geometry or the particular coordinate system that s used to describe it .",
    "however , we noted from the outset that these ` radial ' geodesics that we ve now described by the lines @xmath99 , along which particles all measure their own proper time to increase with @xmath27 , describe the world lines of particles that are all fundamentally at rest  i.e .",
    ", at rest with respect to the vanishing of the effective field potential .",
    "these particles should nt all emerge from the origin at different times , yet somehow evolve together as a coherent set , but _ by weyl s principle _",
    "they should all emerge from the origin _ together _ , and evolve through the field that varies in @xmath26 _ together for all time_. in that case , space will be homogeneous , since the constant cosmic time slices can be written independent of spatial coordinates ; so every fundamental observer can arbitrarily set its spatial position as @xmath100 and therefore its origin in time as @xmath68 .",
    "the spaces of constant cosmic time should therefore be those slices for which @xmath101i.e . , we set @xmath102 as the proper measure of cosmic time in the fundamental rest frame of the universe defined by this coherent bundle of geodesics , so that eq .",
    "( [ t(tau , chi ) ] ) becomes @xmath103 the spacelike slices of constant @xmath104 are at @xmath105 angles in the @xmath106-plane , and are therefore definitely not synchronous with respect to the fundamental geodesics .",
    "however , given this definition of cosmic time , the redshift of light that was emitted at @xmath107 and is observed now , at @xmath108 , should be @xmath109 where @xmath110 has exactly the form of the flat @xmath0cdm scale - factor ( cf .",
    "( [ scalefac_scaleinvtau ] ) ) , which is exactly the form of expansion in our universe that has been increasingly constrained over the last fifteen years @xcite .",
    "+   +   + now , in order to properly theoretically interpret this result for the observed redshift in our sds cosmology , it should be considered in relation to flrw cosmology  and particularly the theory s basic assumptions . as noted in ",
    "[ sec_ifc ] , these are : i.  a congruence of geodesics , ii .  hypersurface orthogonality , iii .  homogeneity , and iv .",
    "assumptions i.  and ii .",
    "have a lot to do with how one defines ` simultaneity ' , which i ve discussed both in the context of special relativity in   [ sec_tcp ] , and now in the context of the sds cosmology , in which simultaneous events in the course of cosmic time are _ not _ synchronous _ even in the fundamental rest frame_. as the discussion should indicate , the definition of ` simultaneity ' is somewhat arbitrary  and it is an _ assumption _ in any case  and should be made with the physics in mind .",
    "einstein obviously had the physics in mind when he proposed using an operational definition of simultaneity @xcite ; but it s since been realised that even special relativity , given this definition , comes to mean that time ca nt pass , etc .",
    ", as noted in   [ sec_tcp ] .    special relativity",
    "should _ therefore be taken as an advance on newton s bucket argument , indicating that not only should acceleration be absolute , as newton showed ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a good discussion of newton s argument ) , but velocity should be as well , since time obviously passes  which it ca nt do , according to special relativity , if motion is nt _ always _ absolute .",
    "usually , however , the opposite is done , and people who ve been unwilling or unable to update the subjective and arbitrary definitions of simultaneity , etc .",
    ", from those laid down by einstein in 1905 , have simply concluded that physical reality has to be a four - dimensional block in which time does nt pass , and the apparent passage of time is a stubborn illusion ; see , e.g. ,   5 in @xcite for a popular account of this , in addition to refs .",
    "the discussion in   [ sec_tcp ] shows how to move forward with a realistic , physical , _ relativistic _",
    "description of objective temporal passage , which can be done only when ` simultaneity ' is not equated with ` synchronicity ' ; and another useful thought - experiment along those lines , which shows how perfectly acceptable it is to assume objective temporal passage in spite of relativistic effects , is presented in my more recent fqxi essay @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the hardcore relativists who would give up temporal passage in favour of an operational definition of simultaneity , einstein was the first relativist to renege on truly relative simultaneity when he assumed an absolute time in constructing his cosmological model @xcite ; and despite immediately being chastised by de  sitter over this @xcite , he never did balk in making the same assumption whenever he considered the cosmological problem @xcite  as did just about every other cosmologist who followed , with very few notable exceptions ( e.g. , de sitter @xcite was one , as there was no absolute time implicit in his model ) .",
    "but whenever the assumption of absolute time has been made in cosmology , it s been made together with special relativity s baggage , as the slices of true simultaneity have been assumed to be synchronous in the fundamental rest frame .",
    "now we see that , not only is the operational definition _",
    "wrong _ in the case of special relativity ( since it comes to require that time does not pass , which is realistically unacceptable ) , but here we ve considered a general relativistic example in which equating ` simultaneity ' and ` synchronicity ' makes even less sense in terms of a reasonable physical interpretation of the mathematical description , since the interpretation is _",
    "causally incoherent_. the main argument of this essay was therefore , that while assumption i.  of flrw cosmology is justified from the point of view that relative temporal passage should be coherent , assumption ii .",
    "is not , and this unjustified special relativistic baggage should be shed by cosmologists ( and really by all relativists , as it leads to further wrong interpretations of the physics ) .",
    "assumption iii .  hardly requires discussion .",
    "it s a mathematical statement of the cosmological principle  that no observer holds a special place , but the universe should look the same from every location  and is therefore as fundamental an assumption as the principle of relativity .",
    "furthermore , our sds universe _ is _ homogeneous , so there is no problem .    the final assumption , however , is a concern .",
    "the isotopy of our universe is an empirical fact  it looks the same to us in every direction , and must have done since its beginning .",
    "in contrast , the spatial slices of the cosmological sds solution are _ not _ isotropic : they re a 2-sphere with extrinsic radius of curvature @xmath26 , multiplied by another dimension that scales differently with @xmath26 . furthermore , by eq .",
    "( [ dtdr ] ) we know that all these fundamental world lines move uniformly through this third spatial dimension @xmath25 as @xmath26 increases .",
    "the sds cosmology therefore describes a universe that should be conceived as follows : first of all suppressing one spatial dimension , the universe can be thought of as a 2-sphere that expands from a point , while all fundamental observers forever motionless along the surface ; then , the third spatial dimension should be thought of as a line at each point on the sphere , through which fundamental observers travel uniformly in the course of cosmic time .",
    "since it s a general relativistic solution , the distinction between curvature along that third dimension of space and motion through it is not well - defined .",
    "however , a possibility presents itself through an analogy with the _ local _ form of the sds solution . as with all physically meaningful solutions of the einstein field equations ,",
    "this one begins with a physical concept from which a general line - element is written ; then the line - element gets sent through the field equations and certain restrictions on functions of the field - variables emerge , allowing us to constrain the general form to something more specific that satisfies the requisite second - order differential equations .",
    "this is , e.g. , also how flrw cosmology is done ",
    "i.e . , first the rw line - element satisfying four basic physical / geometrical requirements is written down , and then it s sent through the field equations to determine equations that restrict the form of the scale - factor s evolution , under a further assumption that finite matter densities in the universe should influence the expansion rate .",
    "the local sds solution , too , is derived as the vacuum field that forever has spacelike radial symmetry about some central gravitating body , and the field equations are solved to restrict the form of the metric coefficients in the assumed coordinate system .",

    "prior to algebraic abstraction ( i.e. the assumption of a lorentzian metric and a particular coordinate system ) , the geometrical picture is already set ; and it s upon that basic geometrical set - up that the algebraic properties of the general relativistic field are imposed .",
    "this construction of the local sds solution through physical considerations of light - propagation will be used analogously in constructing a geometrical picture upon which the cosmological sds solution can be based  which indeed shows that , along with describing a homogeneous universe in which the evolution of cosmic redshifts would be measured _ exactly _ as they have been in our universe ( as proven here already ) , the sds universe should appear isotropic in the fundamental rest frame . but before coming to that , a few more general remarks are necessary , for the examples of the local sds and flrw solutions illustrate a profound thing ; viz . that much of the _ physics",
    "_ enters into the description already in defining the basic geometrical picture and the corresponding line - element that broadly sets - up the physical situation of interest , which is then further constrained by requiring that it satisfy the specific properties that are generally imposed by einstein s field law .",
    "in fact , when it comes to the cosmological problem , and we begin _ as always _ by assuming what will be our _ actual _ space , and how it will roughly evolve as _ actual _ cosmic time passes  i.e . by _ first _ assuming prior _ kinematical _ definitions of absolute space and time , and then constructing an appropriate cosmological line - element , which is finally constrained through the _ dynamical _ field law  there is really a lot of room to make it as we d like it .",
    "but we ve now got a particular line - element in mind ( viz . the sds cosmological solution ) , and we can use it in guiding the basic kinematical definitions that we make . in particular , we have the description of a universe that _ is _ a two - dimensional sphere that expands as a well - defined function of the proper time of fundamental observers that all remain absolutely at rest , plus another dimension through which those same observers _ are _ moving at a rate that varies through the course of cosmic time . according to the equivalence principle , it may be that there is a non - vanishing gravitational field in that particular direction of space , guiding these fundamental observers along , or that this direction is uniform as well , and that the fundamental observers are moving along it , and therefore describe it relatively differently .",
    "what s interesting about this latter possibility , is that there would be a fundamental metric describing the evolution of this uniform space through which all the fundamental observers are moving , and that the metric pertaining to them in their proper frames , which they use in describing the evolution of space - time , should nt necessarily _ have _ to be the same fundamental metric transformed to an appropriate coordinate system .",
    "it might be defined differently for other physical reasons . in this case ,",
    "an affine connection defining those world lines as fundamental geodesics may not be _ compatible _ with the more basic metric , and could be taken as the covariant derivative of a different one .",
    "the picture starts to resemble teleparallelism much more closely than it does general relativity ; but since the two theories are equivalent , and we ve recognised that in any case the kinematical definitions are _ more fundamental _ than the covariant dynamical description , since they constitute the basic first principles of the physical theory , we ll press on in this vein .    let us suppose a situation where there is actually no gravitational mass at all , but fundamental inertial observers  the constituent dynamical matter of our system  are _ really _ moving uniformly through a universe that fundamentally _ is _ isotropic and homogeneous , and expands through the course of cosmic time .",
    "the fundamental metric for this universe should satisfy even the rw line - element s orthogonality assumption , although the slices of constant cosmic time would _ not _ be synchronous in the rest frame of the fundamental observers . since space , in the two - dimensional slice of the sds universe in which fundamental observers are _ not _ moving , really _ is _ spherical , the obvious choice is an expanding 3-sphere , with line - element @xmath113 where the radius @xmath114 varies , according to the vacuum field equations , as @xmath115 in particular , because a teleparallel theory would require a parallelisable manifold , we note that this is true if @xmath116 and the de  sitter metric is recovered ( cf .",
    "( [ ds_comoving_univ ] ) ) . while there may be concern because in this case @xmath117 is a minimum of contracting and expanding space",
    ", i ll argue below that this may actually be an advantage .",
    "this foliation of de  sitter space is particularly promising for a couple of reasons : i.  the bundle of fundamental geodesics in eq .",
    "( [ ds_comoving_univ ] ) are world lines of massless particles , i.e.  the ones at @xmath29 for all @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) with @xmath118 ; and ii .  unlike , e.g.",
    ", the 2-sphere ( or spheres of just about every dimension ) , the 3-sphere _ is _ parallelisable , so it s possible to define an objective direction of motion for the dynamic matter .",
    "now we re finally prepared to make use , by analogy , of the derivation of the local sds metric in terms of the propagation of light along null lines . in contrast , we re now beginning from the description of a universe in which particles that _ are nt _ moving through space are massless , but we want to write down a different lorentzian metric to describe the situation from the perspective of particles that _ are _ all moving through it at a certain rate , who define null lines as the paths of relatively moving masselss particles ; so ,",
    "we ll write down a new metric to use from the perspective of particles that all move along null lines pointing in one direction of space , who describe the relatively moving paths of massless particles as null lines instead . this new line - element can be written , @xmath119 where @xmath26 points in the direction of the universe s increasing timelike radius , and @xmath25 describes the dimension of space through which the fundamental particles are moving . solving einstein s field equations proves the jebsen - birkhoff theorem  that @xmath120 and @xmath121 are independent of the spacelike variable @xmath25and leads to the cosmological sds solution , eq .",
    "( [ sds_statical ] ) , as the abstract description of this physical picture .",
    "thus , we ve come full circle to a statement of the line - element that we started with .",
    "our analysis began with a proof that in this homogeneous universe , redshifts should evolve with exactly the form that they do in a flat @xmath0cdm universe ; and in the last few pages we ve aimed at describing a physical situation in which this line - element would apply , and the observed large scale structure would be isotropic . and indeed , in this universe , in which the spatial anisotropy in the line - element is an artifact of the motion of fundamental observers through homogeneous and isotropic expanding space _ and _ their definition of space - time s null lines , this would be so ; for as long as these fundamental observers are uniformly distributed in space that really is isotropic and homogeneous , all snapshots of constant cosmic time ( and therefore the development , looking back in time with increasing radius all the way to the cosmological horizon ) should appear isotropic , since these uniformly distributed observers would always be at rest relative to each other .",
    "now , as we ve come to the description of a hypothetical universe that _ should _ appear to expand just as ours does , it is time to take stock of the basic physical assumptions we ve had to make , in relation to the ones we should have to reject . our basic starting point , which the essay argued for , was to assume the description of a three - dimensional universe that expands as absolute time passes , just as in standard flrw cosmology . then , having made this assumption , it was shown that the sds solution could be used to describe a homogeneous universe that would appear isotropic in the fundamental rest frame , where redshifts would necessarily evolve in proper cosmic time with precisely the form we do observe in our universe .",
    "in contrast to flrw cosmology , however , the spatial slices of constant time are not synchronous in the fundamental rest frame ; so that assumption of flrw cosmology was rejected , as the essay argued .",
    "but then , in order to reconcile observed isotropy in this universe , we had to make an assumption about the basic dynamical nature of matter and photons  that all mass might be fundamentally inertial , and that photons take paths of maximal length in de  sitter space  which , in contrast to relativity theory s postulate about the kinematical description of light , would pertain more immediately to its basic physical nature",
    ".    this additional hypothesis , along with the greater assumption that a vacuum solution of the einstein field equations could be used to model the large scale evolution of our universe , will not be easily accepted , e.g.  as professor ellis criticism indicates ; for it entails a rejection of perhaps the most cherished of general relativity s basic assumptions  viz .  that the world - matter should _ actually _ curve space and influence its evolution , and that the abstract coordinates themselves should have no real geometrical meaning .",
    "the latter point was made most significantly by einstein in his autobiography @xcite , and was later used as a springboard for the most famous and comprehensive treatment of einstein s theory of gravitation to - date  following a brief , but significant statement of the former point , regarding the most basic notion of general relativity ; viz .  the concept of space - time - matter reciprocity  that ` _ _ space acts on matter , telling it how to move . in turn",

    "while the curvature and evolution of space is supposed to causally depend on the matter - density , according to the very basis of einstein s theory of gravitation , the assumption that space is isotropic and homogeneous is not justified as long as the universe s age is finite . therefore , while this guiding principle that einstein used in the derivation of his static universe model @xcite was somewhat justified in that case , the existence of a causal event horizon in a universe of finite age means assuming the universe _ really is _ homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scale is completely unjustified .",
    "the horizon problem , together with the fact that the universe appears to be flat even though it really should nt be , are problems that inflation theory is supposed to solve  i.e .",
    ", inflation is supposed to explain why a universe that actually _ is nt _ homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scale ( which is the type of universe that s expected , according to general relativity theory ) would _ appear _ isotropic all the way out to the current cosmological event horizon , and also why it should be flat when we d otherwise expect it to be far from that @xcite .",

    "in addition to the problems that are supposed to be addressed by inflation theory , and its explanatory shortfalls , the standard cosmological model also describes a universe full of ` cold dark matter ' and ` dark energy ' , with only about 5% of its matter - density comprised of regular stuff .",

    "[ sec_oce ] , even the simple fact that the universe is expanding is _ entirely unexplained _ in the context of flrw big bang cosmology .",
    "in fact , not only is an answer to the question ` why should the universe be expanding ? ' ( which would amount to an explanation ) lacking in this picture , but since the force that s supposed to drive scale factor evolution in these universes  viz .",
    "the matter - density  is _ decelerative _ to begin with , such universes actually",
    "_ should nt ever _ begin to expand . and",
    "the one possible fundamental aspect of physical reality we know of that could explain why the universe _ should _ expand in the course of cosmic time ",

    ", depending on how one looks at it ) great progress that s been made in experimental cosmology , the _ theory _ , apart from the physics of the cmbr , is a complete mess .",
    "enormous advances have been made through the observation of the big bang s relic radiation _ because we have an understanding of what it is_. in contrast , the rest is an unexpected mess of issues that want explanation and have therefore limited the progress of knowledge . as ijjas et al",

    "should really be rejected once and for all , and be replaced with a basic conviction that _ physical reality really should be as it is_which is something we _ can _ describe , given the right axiomatic basis .",
    "and so , in light of the fact that so much of our cosmological observations have really been unexpected , and in the same spirit of critical analysis that einstein noted one usually takes in order to determine ` which of our basic physical assumptions are wrong ' , this appendix began with a sharper assertion on the absolute nature of cosmic time than the one that has anyhow always been weakly made in cosmology  and a corresponding rejection of one of flrw cosmology s basic assumptions , as the essay argued_because the development of the science in question demands it_. then , through specific analysis of the cosmological sds solution , with the aim of determining in what physical context that could possibly be taken to describe an expanding universe like ours , we found that it might do so just in case the world - matter would nt actually curve the basic fabric of reality , and all mass would be fundamentally inertial in a cosmological context .",
    "thus , it was proposed that two basic concepts of general relativity ",
    "viz .  that mass curves space and is in turn guided along in reciprocal action and reaction , and that coordinates",
    "must have no immediate metrical meaning ",
    "would also have to be rejected , along with the corresponding principle of relativistic cosmology , that the curvature and evolution of the universe should be determined by its matter content .    indeed ,",
    "if the universe really does have absolute background structure similar to that which has commonly been assumed in relativistic cosmology , then the specific coordinates that describe that structure _ do _ have immediate metrical meaning that should be consistently and objectively accounted for . and , far from being a _ problem _ of the sds cosmology , the idea that the curvature and evolution of the universe would nt be influenced by locally gravitating matter might be seen as an _ advantage _ of the theory we use to describe our finite - aged universe ",
    "i.e .  in light of the horizon ,",
    "flatness , dark matter , and dark energy problems , as well as the problem of explaining expansion , since these all stem from assuming the alternative .",
    "in contrast , in the theory described here , cosmic expansion should essentially _ coincide _ with the passage of time , so the universe _ should be expanding _ simply because time is passing  and the model predicts it should do so with exactly the form that we observe .    when i mentioned to professor ellis in the essay contest discussions , that i think the results i ve presented here should provide some cause to seriously reconsider the assumption that the expansion rate of the universe should be influenced by its material content  a fundamental assumption of standard cosmology which professor loeb also challenged in his submission to the contest  his response was , ` well its not only of cosmology its gravitational theory .",
    "it describes solar system dynamics , structure formation , black holes and their interactions , and gravitational waves .",
    "the assumption is that the gravitational dynamics that holds on small scales also holds on large scales .",
    "it s worked so far . ' however , given due recognition of the significant problems of modern cosmology , the argument that  einstein s explanation of ",
    "gravitation should be kept locked tight in our little treasure chest of absolute a priori givens because ` it s worked so far ' , seems particularly weak .",
    "in fact , if any lesson should be taken from the above statement of einstein s , it must be that ` it s worked so far'in other words , ` it s proven useful in the order of things'is an argument that should _ never ever _ be made against the healthy scepticism that all of our basic physical assumptions must warrant .",
    "even so , the rejection of such an important concept must be for a very good reason , and it may very well be objected that the specific geometrical structure of the alternative sds model entails a significant assumption on the fundamental geometry of physical reality , which there should be a reason for ; i.e. , the question arises : if the geometry is not determined by the world - matter , then by what ? while a detailed answer to this question hasnt been worked out , it is relevant to note that the local form of the sds solution  which is only parametrically different from the cosmological form upon which our analysis has been based ; i.e.  @xmath122 rather than @xmath23is the space - time description outside a spherically symmetric , uncharged black hole , which is exactly the type that s expected to result from the eventual collapse of every massive cluster of galaxies in our universe  even if it takes all of cosmic time for that collapse to finally occur .",
    "in fact , there seems to be particular promise in this direction , given that the singularity at @xmath29 in our description is nt a real physical singularity , but the artifact of a derivative metric that must be ill - defined there , since space must actually always have a finite radius according to the fundamental metric .",
    "this is the potential advantage that was noted above , of the finite minimum radius of the foliation of de  sitter space defined in eq .",
    "( [ ds_comoving_univ ] ) . and",
    "as far as that goes , it should be noted that the penrose - hawking singularity theorem ` can not be directly applied when a _ positive cosmological constant _",
    "@xmath123 is present ' @xcite , which is indeed our case .",
    "for all these reasons , we might realistically expect a description in which gravitational collapse leads to universal birth , and thus an explanation of the big bang and the basic cosmic structure we ve had to assume .",
    "along with such new possibilities as an updated description of collapse , and of gravitation in general , that may be explored in a relativistic context when the absolute background structure of cosmology is objectively assumed , the sds cosmology , through its specific requirement that the observed rate of expansion _ should be _ described exactly by the flat @xmath0cdm scale - factor , has the distinct possibility to _ explain _ why our universe should have expanded as it evidently has  and therein lies its greatest advantage ."
