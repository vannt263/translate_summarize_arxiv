    "we focus our attention on phase synchronization in stochastic systems that has attracted recent interest for the following reason : in many practical applications the dynamics of a system , though not perfectly periodic , can still be understood as the manifestation of a stochastically modulated limit cycle @xcite . as examples , we mention neuronal activity @xcite , the cardiorespiratory system @xcite , or population dynamics @xcite .",
    "given a data set or some model dynamics there exists a variety of methods to define an instantaneous phase @xmath3 of a signal or a dynamics . for a clear cut separation of deterministic and noise - induced effects it is essential to assess the robustness of each of these different phase definitions with respect to noise .",
    "section [ sec:1 ] is devoted to this issue .",
    "since we do not distinguish between dynamical and measurement noise @xcite our treatment is also tied to the question how synchronization can be detected within any realistic experimental data .",
    "the synchronization properties of a noisy system can be classified in a hierarchical manner : stochastic phase locking always implies frequency locking while the converse is not true in general . on the other hand ,",
    "small phase diffusivity is necessary but not sufficient for phase synchronization .",

    "its relation to the frequency based on the widely used hilbert phase ( cf .",

    "a phase occurs in a quite natural way when describing the cyclic motion of an oscillator in phase space .",
    "self - sustained oscillators are nonlinear systems that asymptotically move on a limit cycle .",
    "the instantaneous position in phase space can be represented through instantaneous amplitude @xmath5 and phase @xmath6 .",
    "a systematic approach to relate the amplitude and phase dynamics to the dynamics formulated in original phase space was developed by bogoliubov and mitropolski @xcite .",
    "their method starts from the following decomposition of the dynamics @xmath7 where the function @xmath8 comprises all terms of higher than first order in @xmath9 ( nonlinearities ) , velocity dependent terms ( friction ) , and noise . in their work bogoliubov and mitropolski",
    "considered the function @xmath8 to be a small perturbation of order @xmath10 which means that the system is weakly nonlinear and the noise or the external forces are comparatively small as not to distort the harmonic signal too much .",

    "( [ eq : phidot ] ) , the phase velocity always assumes a specific value for @xmath18 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath20 this has the following remarkable consequence .",
    "we see that even in the presence of noise passages through zero in the upper half plane @xmath21 are only possible from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , in the lower half plane only from @xmath23 to @xmath22 .",
    "this insight becomes even more obvious from a geometrical interpretation : as the noise exclusively acts on the velocity @xmath11 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : bogmist1b ] ) , it can only effect changes in the vertical direction ( in @xmath15-space ) . along the vertical line @xmath18",
    ", however , the angular motion possesses no vertical component while radial motion is solely in the vertical direction and , therefore , only affected by the noise . from this",
    "we conclude that between subsequent zero crossings of the coordinate with positive velocity the phase has increased by an amount of @xmath24 .",
    "this finding establishes a simple operational instruction how to measure the average phase velocity of stochastic systems .",
    "we will come back to this point in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ]      as we have just seen zero crossings can be utilized to mark the completion of a cycle .",
    "this can be generalized to the crossings of an arbitrary threshold with positive velocity or even to the crossing of some separatrix . in this connection",
    "the concept of isochrones of a limit cycle has to be mentioned @xcite .",
    "all of these extensions of the natural phase require a thorough knowledge of the dynamics and the phase space structure .",
    "in many practical applications , however , the detailed phase portrait is not known . instead",
    ", one is given a data series exhibiting a repetition of characteristic marker events , e.g.  the spiky peaks of neural activity , the r - peaks of an electrocardiogram , or pronounced maxima as found in population dynamics .",
    "these marker events can be used to pinpoint the completion of a cycle , @xmath26 , and the beginning of a subsequent one , @xmath27 .",
    "it is then possible to define an instantaneous phase @xmath28 by linear interpolation , i.e. , @xmath29 where the times @xmath30 are fixed by the marker events . reexpressing the time series @xmath31 of the system as @xmath32,\\ ] ]",
    "then defines an instantaneous amplitude @xmath33 .",
    "the benefit of such a treatment is to reveal a synchronization of two or more such signals : whereas the instantaneous amplitudes and , therefore , the time series might look rather different , the phase evolution can display quite some similarity .",
    "if the average growth rates of phases match ( notwithstanding the fact that phases may diffuse rapidly ) the result is termed frequency locking .",
    "small phase diffusion , in addition to frequency locking , means that phases are practically locked during long episodes that occasionally are disrupted by phase slips caused by sufficiently large fluctuations .",
    "this elucidates the meaning of effective phase synchronization in stochastic systems .",
    "as should be clear from its definition the linear phase relies on the clear identification of marker events . with increasing noise intensity",
    "this identification will fail since sufficiently large fluctuations may either mask true or imitate spurious marker events . on the other hand , in some cases , e.g.  for excitable systems",
    ", fluctuations can be essential for the generation of marker events , i.e. , marker events may be noise - induced .",
    "as a final remark , let us mention that relative maxima of a differentiable signal @xmath31 correspond to positive - going zeros of its derivative @xmath34 .",
    "however , this seemingly trivial connection is overshadowed by complications if the derivative itself is a non - smooth function that does not allow to easily extract the number of zero crossings ( cf .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and fig .",
    "[ f_oscillator ] ) .      in situations",
    "where a measured signal @xmath31 exhibits a lot of irregularity it is not quite clear how to define a phase  the signal might look far from a perturbed harmonic or even periodic one and marker events can not be identified unambiguously .",
    "the concept of the analytic signal as introduced by gabor @xcite offers a way to relate the signal @xmath31 to an instantaneous amplitude @xmath36 and a phase @xmath37 .",
    "the physical relevance of a such constructed phase is a question of its own ; for narrow - band signals or harmonic noise it has a clear physical meaning whereas the general case requires further considerations ( cf .",
    "appendix a2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the analytic signal approach extends the real signal @xmath31 to a complex one @xmath38 $ ] with the imaginary part @xmath39 resulting from an appropriate transformation of the real part @xmath31 . instead of taking @xmath40 as for the natural phase we search @xmath39 as the result of a convolution of @xmath31 with some appropriate kernel @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 now , _",
    "means that the kernel has to be chosen such that the method reproduces the phase of a harmonic signal .",
    "applying the convolution theorem it is easy to see that the fourier transform @xmath43 of the transformed signal @xmath39 should be related to the fourier transform @xmath44 of the original signal @xmath31 by a phase shift that transforms a cosine into a sine , i.e. , @xmath45 where sgn(@xmath46 ) is the sign function . by an inverse fourier",
    "transform we thus find that @xmath47 which implies that @xmath39 is related to @xmath31 via the hilbert transform @xmath48 the symbol @xmath49 in front of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hilberttrafo ] ) is a reminder that the integral has to be evaluated in the sense of the cauchy principal value .",
    "the fact that the hilbert phase @xcite @xmath50\\ ] ] arises as the result of a convolution instead of a differentiation makes it less sensitive to short - lived small fluctuations .",
    "this observation was already reported by vainstein and vakman @xcite .",
    "moreover , the construction by a convolution brings the hilbert phase in close contact with the wavelet transform that is widely used to compute a time - dependent spectral decomposition of non - stationary signals @xcite . by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourhilb ] ) it is evident that the fourier transform of the analytic signal @xmath51 satisfies the relation @xmath52\\,x(\\omega )    = 2\\,\\theta(\\omega)\\,x(\\omega)\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the step function .",
    "equation ( [ eq : anasigfourier ] ) shows that all positive fourier components of the original signal contribute with equal weights .",
    "selecting , instead , a certain frequency band by using a subsequent gaussian filter ( in frequency space ) corresponds to a convolution with the morlet wavelet ( gabor function ) .",
    "generalized phase definitions and the wavelet transform were employed to detect phase - synchronous activity in the brain @xcite and in a chaotic laser array @xcite .",
    "multistability is one of the crucial consequences of nonlinearity and plays a dominant role for many important topics , e.g.  evolution , information processing and communication , pattern formation , etc .",
    "frequently , fluctuations play a benificial role in that they effect transitions between the different states that are directly tied to the performance of a task . the phenomenon of sr @xcite , for instance , can be observed in a bistable system .",
    "typically , the information that is processed in a bistable system does not require to keep track of a continuum but is rather contained in the switching events between the two states @xcite .",
    "hence , it is desirable to link the dichotomous switching process to a description in terms of an instantaneous phase . since switching to and fro constitutes one cycle and , thus , corresponds to a phase increment of @xmath24 the linear interpolating phase @xmath25 can be readily constructed employing switchings as marker events of half - cycles .",
    "furthermore , the hilbert phase can be easily computed .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to use the switching process ( between @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) and construct a discrete instantaneous phase @xmath57 changing discontinuously at the switching events .",
    "the last - mentioned instantaneous phase is obtained simply by multiplying the number of switches ( or the number of renewals in renewal theory @xcite ) @xmath58 by the value @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "the instantaneous state , in turn , can be obtained from the discrete phase via @xmath61 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3phases ] we show how the three alternative phases @xmath62 and @xmath54 agree in the description of a dichotomous switching process . note that the natural phase @xmath6 is related to the underlying process in real phase space and , hence , can not be deduced from the two - state signal .",
    "the advantage of the discrete phase is that it allows an analytic treatment of effective phase synchronization in stochastic bistable systems .",
    "this will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "the robustness of the discrete phase with respect to noise comes into play not when making the `` transition '' from the switching process to the instantaneous phase @xmath57 but when constructing the switching events from the continuous stochastic trajectory . at the level of a markovian switching process noise",
    "enters only via its intensity that changes transition rates .      in systems of dimension @xmath63",
    "there are various ways how to define one or even more instantaneous phases : projecting the @xmath64-dimensional phase space onto 2-dimensional surfaces , choosing poincar sections or computing the hilbert phase for each of the coordinates .",
    "many of the methods can only be done numerically and always require to consider the dynamics in detail in order to check whether a made choice is appropriate .",
    "we will not elaborate these details here but refer to @xcite ( especially chap .",
    "10 ) and references therein .",
    "in this section we consider a stochastic bistable system , for instance a noisy schmitt trigger , which is driven externally either by a dichotomous periodic process ( dpp ) or a dichotomous markovian process ( dmp ) .",
    "the dichotomous character of the input shall be either due to a two - state filtering or be rooted in the generation mechanism of the signal .",
    "the bistable system generates a dichotomous output signal . for convenience",
    "we choose to label input and output states with values @xmath56 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "the dpp is completely specified by its angular frequency @xmath65 where @xmath2 is the half - period .",
    "accordingly , the dmp is fully characterized by its average switching rate @xmath66 .    since both input and output are two - state variables it is possible to study phase synchronization in terms of discrete indicating the discrete phase considered throughout this section ] input and output phases @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "consequently , also the phase difference @xmath69 is a discrete quantity that can assume positive and negative multiples of @xmath59 . from the definition of the phase difference",

    "<S> the phenomenon of frequency and phase synchronization in stochastic systems requires a revision of concepts originally phrased in the context of purely deterministic systems . </S>",
    "<S> various definitions of an instantaneous phase are presented and compared with each other with special attention payed to their robustness with respect to noise . </S>",
    "<S> we review the results of an analytic approach describing noise - induced phase synchronization in a thermal two - state system . in this context </S>",
    "<S> exact expressions for the mean frequency and the phase diffusivity are obtained that together determine the average length of locking episodes . a recently proposed method to quantify frequency synchronization in noisy potential systems </S>",
    "<S> is presented and exemplified by applying it to the periodically driven noisy harmonic oscillator . since this method is based on a threshold crossing rate pioneered by s.o . </S>",
    "<S> rice the related phase velocity is termed rice frequency . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the relation between the phenomenon of stochastic resonance and noise - enhanced phase coherence by applying the developed concepts to the periodically driven bistable kramers oscillator .    * </S>",
    "<S> studying synchronization phenomena in stochastic systems necessitates a revision of concepts originally developed for deterministic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this statement becomes obvious when considering the famous phase - locking effect @xcite : unbounded fluctuations that occur , for instance , in gaussian noise will always prevent the existence of a strict bound for the asymptotic phase difference of two systems . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a reformulation of the synchronization phenomenon in the presence of noise is possible by quantifying the average duration @xmath0 of locking epochs that are disrupted by phase slips . in case that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is some characteristic time of the dynamics , e.g.  the period of an external drive or the inverse of some intrinsic natural frequency , it is justified to speak about effective phase synchronization . * </S>"
