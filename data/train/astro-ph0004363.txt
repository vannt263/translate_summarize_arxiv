    "the infrared emission - line spectrum of a young stellar object ( yso ) is dominated by the interaction of the central star with the remnants of the clouds from which it formed .",
    "the intense uv radiation generated by accretion as well as by the central star itself causes dissociation of molecular material close to the yso and ionizes much of the atomic material , giving rise to typical nebular and recombination lines .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of the uv field with the remnants of the star s natal cloud will produce a photodissociation region ( pdr ; see hollenbach & tielens 1999 for a comprehensive review ) . in a pdr , heating of the gas occurs by collisions with electrons , photoelectrically ejected from grain surfaces .",
    "the gas in the surface regions of pdrs reaches temperatures of typically 500  k ( e.g. tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) , producing a distinctive infrared spectrum due to collisionally excited low - lying levels of many molecular and neutral species .",
    "another phenomenon associated with ysos are strong stellar winds , often collimated into a bipolar outflow .",
    "these will cause a shock as they drive a supersonic wave into the surrounding molecular cloud , heating it in the process .",
    "shocks are usually divided into two distinct categories : j- or jump - shocks , and c- or continuous - shocks . in j - shocks",
    "viscous heating of the neutrals occurs in a thin shock front in which radiative cooling is insignificant , while the post - shock gas is heated to several times 10@xmath5 degrees , dissociating all molecular material ( e.g. hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) .",
    "cooling of the post - shock gas occurs through atomic fine - structure lines as well as through re - formation of molecules .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "c - shocks are magnetized , non - dissociative shocks in which the physical conditions change more gradually from their pre- to post - shock values and cooling is mainly through radiation from molecular material ( e.g. kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) . if the temperatures in a c - shock become sufficiently high to start to dissociate molecules , the cooling through the molecular lines diminishes , and the shock temperature increases until it turns into a j - shock .",
    "shocks with a shock velocity larger than 40  km  s@xmath6 are usually j - shocks , whereas slower shocks are usually of c - type ( chernoff et al .",
    "1982 ) . in this paper",
    "we will illustrate the power of infrared spectroscopy to study the above mentioned phenomena using two young bipolar nebulae , s106 and cep  a.    the bipolar nebula s106 is one of the most studied hii regions in our galaxy .",

    "a dark lane , largely devoid of any optical or infrared emission , separates the two lobes of the hii region .",
    "this dark lane has been quoted many times as a prime example of a large ( 30 ) circumstellar disk , consisting of cool gas and dust , seen nearly edge - on ( bieging 1984 ; mezger et al . 1987 ) . however , loushin et al .",

    "radio - observations show that it contains two strings of about 13 ultracompact hii regions , arranged in a y - shape ( hughes 1988 ) .",
    "the source irs 6a ( lenzen et al . 1984 ) , located in the infrared nebula to the east of the core , is the dominant source of the eastern lobe at 20  @xmath4 m ( ellis et al . 1990 ) , but polarization measurements show that the nebula is illuminated by the compact radio source hw-2 ( hughes & wouterloot 1984 ) , located @xmath10  5   south of irs 6a ( casement & mclean 1996 ) .",

    "the relative discontinuities in s106 are close to the maximum possible values , indicating that the source is extended across the entire sws aperture at the longer wavelengths ( 33@xmath1 20 ) . in cep  a the discontinuities are smaller , pointing to a smaller size of the far - infrared source .    since both spectrometers on board iso use entrance apertures that are smaller than the beam size , a wavelength dependent correction has to be applied to the standard flux calibration when observing extended sources .",
    "we determined these correction factors by convolving the k - band images of s106 and cep  a east , with the beam profile and applied these to the data before further analysis .",

    "as can be seen from these plots , the pdr and j - shock models predict a fairly small ( 200540  k ) range of resulting excitation temperatures , whereas in the c - shocks this range is much larger ( 1001500  k ) .",
    "furthermore , we see that in the model predictions for shocks the resulting @xmath49 does not depend much on density , whereas for pdrs it does not depend much on @xmath51 , suggesting that once the mechanism of the h@xmath0 emission is established , it can be used to constrain @xmath54 or @xmath50 in a straightforward way .    comparing the excitation temperatures of 500 and 730  k for s106 and cep  a with those plotted in fig .",
    "8 , we note that for s106 this falls well within the range of pdr- and c - shock model predictions , but are too high compared to the ones expected from j - shocks . the observed bright pah emission features ( sect .  3 ) and the atomic fine - structure line spectrum ( sect .",
    "6 ) point towards a pdr origin for the h@xmath0 emission in s106 . the higher temperature for cep  a can only be reproduced by the c - shock models .",
    "therefore we tentatively conclude that a dense ( @xmath55 10@xmath56  cm@xmath2 ) pdr seems to be the best candidate to explain the observed h@xmath0 emission in s106 ir and a slow ( @xmath8 20  km  s@xmath6 ) non - dissociative shock can explain the observed warm column of h@xmath0 in cep  a east .",
    "since the regions we are looking at probably only fill part of the sws beam , the absolute intensity of the h@xmath0 emission listed in table  1 can also be reproduced by these same models by varying the beam filling factor .",
    "in both s106 ir and cep  a east several ro - vibrational emission lines due to gas - phase co were detected in the long - wavelength part of the lws spectra ( figs .",
    "5 and 6 ) .",
    "similar to what was done for the h@xmath0 emission in the previous section , we constructed a co excitation diagrams , using molecular data from kirby - docken & liu ( 1978 ) .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "the temperature and column of co resulting from the boltzmann fit to this excitation diagram are 420  k and 5.6 @xmath1 10@xmath21  cm@xmath37 and 340  k and 1.4 @xmath1 10@xmath21  cm@xmath37 for s106 and cep  a east , respectively .",
    "corresponding co masses are 1 @xmath1 10@xmath37  m@xmath3 ( s106 at 1200  pc ; for the 600  pc distance estimate this mass estimate would decrease to 3 @xmath1 10@xmath2  m@xmath3 ) and 1 @xmath1 10@xmath2  m@xmath3 ( cep  a east ) .",
    "the co excitation temperature of 420  k for s106 is somewhat lower than that found from the h@xmath0 lines , in agreement with what is expected from a pdr , in which the co emission arises in deeper embedded regions than the h@xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that a pdr is the most likely candidate for the source of the gas - phase co emission in s106 .",
    "for cep  a east the co excitation temperature of 340  k is much lower than that found from the h@xmath0 lines .",
    "this behaviour is hard to reconcile with an origin in the c - shock invoked to explain the h@xmath0 observations .",
    "however , a j - shock , necessary to explain the ionic lines which we will discuss in the next section , may produce the observed co emission while only emitting little warm h@xmath0 . since the lws co observations were made with a much larger beam than the sws h@xmath0 observations , an alternative explanation may be that we are observing emission from two spatially distinct regions .",
    "the relatively large mass of warm co as compared to that seen in h@xmath0 may also easily be explained in this scenario .",
    "the observed co lines have critical densities of around 10@xmath56  cm@xmath2 .",
    "therefore the detection of these lines also implies densities of this order of magnitude or higher in the originating region . for the shock seen in cep  a east",
    "this may not be unreasonable .",
    "however , assuming that these densities would exist in the entire s106 pdr would be implausible .",
    "if these co lines do indeed arise in the large - scale environment of s106 , the pdr must therefore have a clumpy structure ( e.g. burton et al .",
    "an alternative explanation of the presence of these lines , would be to identify the originating region with the surface of the extended disk - like structure surrounding s106 which could act like a pdr . with the present data - set we can not make a distinction between these two possibilities .",
    "important constraints on the physical conditions in the line emitting region come from the observed fine structure lines . as a first step towards identifying the mechanism responsible for the observed emission we can look at the mere presence of certain lines .",
    "the observed lines with high ionization potentials in s106 , such as [ oiii ] , [ ariii ] , [ neiii ] , [ niiii ] , [ feiii ] and [ siv ] can only originate in the hii region surrounding s106 .",
    "the pah emission as well as the molecular lines observed towards s106 are indicative of the presence of a pdr as well .",
    "this pdr might contribute to the observed [ feii ] , [ niii ] , [ siii ] , [ oi ] and [ cii ] emission .",
    "we thus need to model the fine - structure lines in s106 ir as arising in the combination of an hii model and a pdr .",
    "we have used the photo - ionization code cloudy ( version 90.04 ; ferland 1996 ) to generate model predictions for line strengths for the hii region surrounding s106 ir , assuming a spherical geometry and constant hydrogen density throughout the region .",
    "we generated a grid of models in which the input spectrum , taken from kurucz ( 1991 ) models for a stellar photosphere , and the electron density in the hii region were varied .",
    "the total luminosity of the model was fixed to the total bolometric luminosity of s106 of 4.2 @xmath1 10@xmath5  l@xmath3 ( computed from the spectral energy distribution using data from literature and assuming a distance of 1.2  kpc ) .",
    "the line ratios of the observed [ oiii ] and [ siii ] fine structure lines are expected to depend mainly on density , and hardly on the temperature .",
    "their behaviour in our hii region model together with the observed line ratios in s106 are shown in fig .",
    "10 . from the fact that both line ratios agree on",
    "the thus obtained value for the electron density in the hii region , 1.32.5 @xmath1 10@xmath58  cm@xmath2 , we conclude that our assumption of a constant density is reasonable .    several other lines ratios ( [ arii]/[ariii ] , [ neii]/[neiii ] and [ siii]/[siv ] ) depend mainly on the effective temperature of the star and do not depend on density much .",
    "their behaviour in the cloudy models for s106 is shown in fig .",
    "10 as well . from these plots",
    ", it can be seen that the source of ionizing photons should have a temperature between 37,000 and 40,000  k , corresponding to a spectral type of o6o8 , in good agreement with earlier determinations ( gehrz et al .",
    "1982 ; staude et al .",
    "1982 ) . however , not all observed line ratios yield the same temperature for the central star .",
    "most likely this is due to the fact that the kurucz models used for the input spectrum do not include the opacity shortward of the heii ionization limit due to the stellar wind , which is expected to be strong in the case of s106 .",
    "the true temperature for the central source is therefore expected to be around the lower range of temperatures deduced from the kurucz synthetic photospheres , i.e. around 37,000  k. for illustrative purposes , we also show the ratio of [ oi ] 63.2  @xmath4m/[oiii ] 51.8  @xmath4 m for our model hii region , showing that virtually all the atomic oxygen will be in the form of [ oiii ] and that we can thus safely attribute all of the observed [ oi ] emission to the pdr .    to be able to explain the observed intensity of 1.3 @xmath1 10@xmath37  erg  s@xmath6  cm@xmath6  sr@xmath6 for the [ siii ] line at 34.8  @xmath4 m in s106",
    ", the tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) pdr models require a density higher than @xmath8 10@xmath60  cm@xmath2 and @xmath51 @xmath55 10@xmath60  g@xmath52 .",
    "this regime can also reproduce the observed ratios of [ siii ] and the [ feii ] and [ oi ] lines , although to reproduce both the exact strength of the [ siii ] emission and the relative strength to that to the [ feii ] lines requires a [ feii ] depletion of @xmath8  30% higher than the one assumed in the tielens & hollenbach models .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that the pdr does nt fill the sws aperture at 35 micrometer ( 33@xmath1 20 ) completely , increasing the surface brightness of all lines .",
    "the predicted intensities of [ si ] and [ fei ] are sufficiently low to be undetectable , in agreement with the observations .    towards cep a east , only fine structure lines that can be produced in shocks were observed .",
    "in contrast to both c- and j - shocks , pdrs do not produce significant quantities of [ si ] emission ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",
    "therefore this line must be completely due to one or more shocks .",
    "c - shocks only contain trace fractions of ions and hence can not explain the observed [ feii ] , [ siii ] and [ cii ] emission .",
    "hence the simplest hypothesis would be to try to explain the observed fine - structure lines in cep  a in terms of a j - shock model .",
    "to explain the [ si ] surface brightness of 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath6 cm@xmath37  sr@xmath6 requires a moderately dense ( 10@xmath510@xmath60 cm@xmath2 ) pre - shock gas . if the shock does not fill the iso beam completely , as is expected , this number will go up .",
    "the absence of [ fei ] emission does indicate that we are dealing with higher ( 10@xmath6010@xmath56  cm@xmath2 ) densities , so line ratios seem to provide more reliable constraints in this case .",
    "however , the aperture sizes for lines measured at different wavelengths are also different in some cases , making this method only reliably applicable to line ratios measured in identical sws or lws apertures . therefore the ratio of [ feii ] 26.0  @xmath4 m to [ si ] 25.2  @xmath4 m might provide the most reliable indicator of physical conditions in the shock . to reproduce the observed value of 0.26 with the hollenbach & mckee ( 1989 ) j - shock models requires either moderately dense ( 10@xmath60  cm@xmath2 ) gas with a low ( 30  km  s@xmath6 ) shock velocity or a high ( 10@xmath56  cm@xmath2 ) density with a faster ( @xmath8 60  km  s@xmath6 ) shock . to have the predicted [ fei ] emission sufficiently low to explain our non - detections of this species , the moderately dense , slow j - shock model is required .",
    "this regime also reproduces the relative [ siii ] strength .",
    "as was discussed in the previous section , one or multiple j - shocks can not reproduce the observed h@xmath0 emission ( although a contribution to this can be expected ) .",
    "the success of the j - shock model in explaining the observed fine - structure lines and the absence of pah emission in cep  a east , excluding the possibility of a significant contribution from a pdr , leads us to pose that a combination of one or more j- and c - shocks must be responsible for the observed emission in cep  a. the presence of more than one type of shock in the region could be linked to the reported multiple episodes of outflow activity from the embedded source ( narayanan & walker 1996 ) . in the presence of both a j- and a c - shock ,",
    "the [ siii ] and [ feii ] emission would originate completely in the j - shock , whereas both the c- and the j - shock would contribute to the observed [ si ] and h@xmath0 spectra . with the j - shock parameters derived from the fine - structure lines , an additional c - shock component with a shock - velocity of about 20  km  s@xmath6 is required to reproduce the observed pure rotational h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the observed hot column of h@xmath0 in cep  a may then be due to formation pumping ( the effect that h@xmath0 gets re - formed with non - zero energy in the post - shock gas after being dissociated in the shock front ) in the j - shock . to have the ro - vibrational lines of comparable intensity as the rotational lines ( through collisional excitation )",
    "requires pre - shock densities of the order of 10@xmath56  cm@xmath2 . for both s106 ir and cep",
    "a , predicted lines strengths of the best fit models are also listed in table  1 .",
    "in the previous sections we saw that the infrared emission - line spectrum of s106 could be well explained by the presence of an hii region and a clumpy pdr .",
    "the average density in the hii region should be around 2 @xmath1 10@xmath58  cm@xmath2 .",
    "the density in the pdr , which was estimated to be 10@xmath6010@xmath56  cm@xmath2 , is several orders of magnitude higher , in agreement with one would expect in a scenario in which a young massive star has photo - ionized its natal cloud in all but the densest clumps .    in section  7",
    "we concluded that the incident fuv flux on the s106 pdr should be rather high ( @xmath55 10@xmath60  g@xmath52 ) .",
    "we also showed that the central source in s106 is of spectral type o8 , with a total luminosity of 4.2 @xmath1 10@xmath5  l@xmath3 . from a kurucz ( 1991 ) model for a stellar photosphere with @xmath61 = 37,000  k and @xmath62 = 4.0 , we compute that such a star emits a total fuv ( 613.6  ev ) flux of 3.6 @xmath1 10@xmath63  erg  s@xmath6  sr@xmath6 . to dilute this stellar fuv field to a value of 10@xmath6010@xmath56  g@xmath52",
    ", the pdr must be at a location 310 @xmath1 10@xmath58  au away from the central star , corresponding to a projected distance of 517 .",
    "this projected distance is independent of the assumed distance towards s106 .",
    "it is within the range allowed by the sws entrance apertures and is compatible with an origin in the @xmath8 30   diameter region of h@xmath0 emission in the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) image of s106 by hayashi et al .",
    "we conclude that a central o8 star is sufficient to produce the fuv radiation field reaching the s106 pdr .",
    "these results agree well with other determinations .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have spatially resolved the 157.7  @xmath4 m [ cii ] and 63.2  @xmath4 m [ oi ] emission in s106 and concluded that there is a pdr region with density @xmath33  10@xmath56  cm@xmath2 and strong ( up to 8 @xmath1 10@xmath60  g@xmath52 ) uv field in the immediate environment of s106 and a more extended dense ( 10@xmath6010@xmath56  g@xmath52 ) pdr region exposed to a lower intensity ( 300500  g@xmath52 ) uv field .",
    "we are clearly dominated by their first component .",
    "this same component may be identified with the high - density ( 10@xmath60  cm@xmath2 ) fluorescent h@xmath0 regions identified by hayashi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .    both the presence of [ si ] 25.2  @xmath4 m emission and the h@xmath0 spectrum point unambiguously to shocked gas as the origin of the infrared emission lines in cep  a east . a combination of a slow ( 20  km  s@xmath6 ) non - dissociative shock and a faster ( 3060  km  s@xmath6 ) dissociative shock are required to explain our iso spectra .",
    "the density of the pre - shock gas in cep  a east is similar to that in the s106 pdr : 10@xmath6010@xmath56  cm@xmath2 .",
    "our j - shock component may be identified with the [ feii ] 1.64  @xmath4 m clumps observed by goetz et al .",
    "the c - shocks could be due to their h@xmath0 knots which do not show ionic emission .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results derived here for the emission from the eastern lobe of cep  a with the results by wright et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , obtained using the same instruments on board iso , for the western part of the nebula .",
    "they derived a @xmath49 of 700 @xmath31 30  k for the h@xmath0 lines with upper level energies up to 7000  k , and a temperature range up to 11,000  k for the higher upper level energies .",
    "they explained this h@xmath0 emission as arising from a combination of at least two c - shocks with different pre - shock density , shock velocity and covering factor .",
    "in addition to this , they also reported emission from [ neii ] , [ si ] and [ siii ] , which they explained as arising in a planar j - shock with pre - shock density of 10@xmath5810@xmath5  cm@xmath2 and shock velocity 7080  km  s@xmath6 . qualitatively , the detected lines in the eastern and western part of the nebula are well in agreement .",
    "the main difference between the observed lines seems to be that they are much more intense in the western part of cep  a , indicating that the densities there are a factor of 100 higher than those obtained for the eastern lobe , but the shock velocities are comparable in both parts of the nebula .",
    "the similarity between these two parts of cep  a are in agreement with a scenario in which the driving source of the molecular outflow , hw-2 , went through multiple episodes of outflow activity , as suggested by narayanan & walker ( 1996 ) . in this scenario , the j - shock component could be due to the most recent period of enhanced mass loss , whereas one or more c - shocks could be due to older generations of outflows .",
    "alternatively , the stellar wind material could produce a ( fast ) j - shock while the surrounding molecular cloud might be swept up by a slower c - shock .    as was already remarked by staude & elssser ( 1993 ) , the differences between the environments of these two massive embedded ysos , s106 and cep  a , are remarkable .",
    "the mid- and far - infrared observations presented in this paper show that the difference between these two sources can not be due to a different orientation of their nebulae ; it can only be a reflection of their different evolutionary status , with cep  a being the younger of the two . in s106 the stellar wind and uv radiation of the exciting source",
    "have cleared and excited a sufficiently large region to create strong pdr emission , whereas in the case of cep  a , the central source is still heavily embedded and we only observe the interaction of the outflow with its surroundings . in due time , cep  a will clear its surroundings , ionize the hydrogen , and evolve into a bipolar nebula quite similar to s106 .",

    "<S> emission from the pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 and the infrared fine structure lines of [ cii ] , [ oi ] , [ si ] , [ siii ] and [ feii ] , as well as absorption bands due to h@xmath0o , co and co@xmath0 ice were detected toward cep  a. in s106 we detected emission lines of h@xmath0 , co , hi , and a large number of ionized species including fe , o , n , c , si , s , ne and ar . s106 also shows many of the infrared pah bands in emission . </S>",
    "<S> excitation temperatures and molecular hydrogen masses were derived from the low - lying pure rotational levels of h@xmath0 and are 500 and 730  k and 8 and 3 @xmath1 10@xmath2  m@xmath3 for s106 and cep  a , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since both objects are expected to have several solar masses of h@xmath0 in their environment , we conclude that in both cases the bulk of the h@xmath0 is cooler than a few hundred kelvins . </S>",
    "<S> excitation temperatures and line ratios were compared with those predicted by theoretical models for pdrs and dissociative and non - dissociative shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the [ si ] 25.2  @xmath4m/[siii ] 34.8  @xmath4 m ratio is a particularly useful shock versus pdr discriminant and we conclude that s106 ir is dominated by pdr emission while cep  a east has a large shock component . from an analysis of the ionic lines in s106 </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the central star must have a temperature around 37,000  k , corresponding to a spectral type of o8 . from its luminosity </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the driving source of cep  a must also be a massive early - type star . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of strong high - ionization ionic lines in its iso spectrum shows that cep  a has not yet created a significant hii region and must be younger than s106 , illustrating the process of the clearing of the surroundings of a massive young star . </S>"
