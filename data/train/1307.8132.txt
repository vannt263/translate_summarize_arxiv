    "the kondo problem describes a magnetic impurity embedded in a fermi sea@xcite .",
    "the spin of the impurity is screened by the spins of the electrons in the bulk forming a collective singlet state .",
    "even though this is one of the most studied and better understood problems in condensed matter physics , we keep finding that our knowledge is incomplete , and open issues remain . in particular , there are questions that require a good description of the states and correlations in real space . for instance",
    ", great attention has been payed to the subtle issues of how to measure , detect , and characterize the so - called `` kondo cloud''@xcite , or how to interpret the finite - size effects and competing energy scales arising when the conduction electrons are confined to a small spatial region in a `` kondo box''@xcite .",
    "moreover , systems where the spatial position of the impurity is relevant ( such as graphene nanoribbons , or topological insulators , where the physics of the edges is very different from the physics of the bulk ) are quite non - trivial and represent a challenge to current state - of - the - art methods .    in the most general formulation of the problem",
    "the coupling of the impurity with the lattice has terms of the form @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the position of the impurity and we used the usual notation , thus @xmath7 creates an electron at the impurity site with spin @xmath8 and @xmath9 destroys an electron with spin @xmath8 at the @xmath10 state ) .",
    "one of the usual approximations is to take simple forms for the dispersion @xmath11 or to ignore the momentum dependence of the couplings @xmath12 , disregarding the information about the specific structure of the lattice@xcite .",
    "most commonly , one finds the impurity interacting with a wide band with a linear dispersion , via a contact local potential .",
    "this corresponds to the impurity being scattered only by @xmath13-wave states , and the problem can be mapped to an equivalent one - dimensional one .",
    "systems where the effect of energy pseudogaps or van - hove singularities are important represent a challenge , and it is known , for instance , that the kondo effect in graphene is quite non - trivial@xcite .",
    "moreover , approximations on the couplings @xmath12 make it difficult to deal with problems where the location of the impurity is relevant . as an example of this later situation we can mention graphene nanoribbons , or topological insulators , where the physics of the surface / edges is very different from the physics of the bulk . at the same time ,",
    "experiments with adatoms on surfaces can be done with great degree of control using techniques such as stm @xcite , therefore , numerical methods that are able to deal with the spatial resolution of the kondo problem are highly desirable .",
    "numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , the optimal technique to study quantum impurities , does not work in a real space representation , but in energy space@xcite .",
    "until recently , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) was the only computational technique that could offer some detail on the spatial structure of the correlations in dimensions larger than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "very recently , remarkable developments in the understanding of the nrg construction and its wave functions have offered a glimpse at the spatial structure of correlations around the impurity@xcite . moreover , using some ingenuity it is possible to introduce arbitrary dispersion / densities of states for the conduction electrons@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a new computational approach that enables one to work with the lattice in a real space representation at arbitrary dimensions with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "the principal idea is to map , via a canonical transformation , the lattice onto a chain structure , in similar fashion to wilson s original nrg formulation@xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "same as in haydock s recursion method@xcite , the information about the lattice structure , and the hybridization to the impurity , is completely preserved .",
    "notice that this canonical transformation is exact , and the new representation of the hamiltonian can be tackled with other methods especially suitable for solving the one - dimensional problem such as the embedded cluster approximation ( eca)@xcite , or dmrg .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we describe the technical aspects of the rotation to the lanczos single particle basis that allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "we also offer a geometrical interpretation of the transformation and the entanglement reduction . in section",
    "iii we explain how to study interacting quantum impurity problems on arbitrary lattice geometries using the dmrg method , illustrating with several proof of concept scenarios , such as 2d and 3d systems , and carbon nanotubes .",
    "section iv focuses on the particular case of graphene nanoribbons and we numerically investigate the influence of the geometry and edge structure on the kondo physics .",
    "we close with a summary and conclusions in section v.    = 7.5 cm",
    "let us start with a simple hamiltonian with one impurity connected to one single lattice site .",
    "a more general case will be discussed below .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the many body impurity hamiltonian , @xmath17 is the lattice hamiltonian and @xmath18 describes the impurity - lattice interaction . for the anderson model ,",
    "the impurity is described by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the occupation operator for an impurity with spin @xmath8 , @xmath21 is a gate potential , and @xmath22 parametrizes the on - site coulomb repulsion between opposite - spin electrons .",
    "the corresponding hybridization term is introduced as @xmath23 where @xmath24 creates an electron at the impurity and @xmath25 destroys an electron at position @xmath26 , the lattice site connected to the impurity .",
    "alternatively , one could introduce the impurity via a kondo hamiltonian , with an interaction @xmath27    the main point of this proposal is to map a complex band structure , for example , a carbon nanotube , a graphene ribbon , or any 2d or 3d system , onto a semi - chain .",
    "this mapping can be done in such a way that an impurity connected to one or more sites of a real lattice is , after the mapping , connected to a single site of a chain .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional problem can then be solved with a method of choice , such as eca or dmrg .    in order to perform the mapping , we need to assume that the band describes non - interacting electrons via a quadratic tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "one can always map a complicated one - body hamiltonian onto a semi - chain by applying the lanczos method in the same spirit as wilson s nrg or haydock s recursion method@xcite . to start the change of basis ,",
    "we choose the orbital that is connected to the impurity as seed for the iterative procedure@xcite(we drop the spin index for now ) : @xmath28 the so - called lanczos basis is constructed as : @xmath29 where , @xmath30 this allows one to construct a basis where the lattice hamiltonian @xmath17 is tri - diagonal : @xmath31 this is an exact canonical transformation , from a single particle basis , onto another complete orthogonal basis .    in fig.[figure1](a )",
    "we show a schematic representation of the problem in real space .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the equivalent hamiltonian in the lanczos basis .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath32 ) become effective hopping terms , while the diagonal ones ( @xmath33 ) introduce local chemical potentials . in second quantization , it reads : @xmath34 where the new `` tilde '' operators refer to the lanczos orbitals along the chain and obey fermionic anti - commutation rules .",
    "notice that the first orbital , corresponding to the one connected to the impurity and used as seed , remains unaltered after the transformation , _",
    "i.e _ , @xmath35 .",
    "as a consequence , the hybridization hamiltonian @xmath18 remains unchanged .",
    "in the process of generating the new basis we find that :    1 .",
    "@xmath36 2 .",
    "@xmath37 3 .",
    "the basis @xmath38 is orthogonal , but it is not normalized .",
    "4 .   obviously",
    ", once one of the @xmath39 vanishes , the rest of the band will decouple .",
    "in fact , all @xmath40 , for @xmath41 , will not be defined ( the rest of the basis belongs to different channels / symmetry sectors ) . 5 .   as @xmath42 grows with @xmath43 , numerical errors due to finite numerical precision",
    "might appear . to avoid them , we have to re - normalize the states @xmath44 at each iteration .",
    "[ num1 ] 6 .   another numerical error to consider is the loss of orthogonality between vectors for large @xmath43 . to avoid that , and keep the basis complete , we orthogonalize each new vector with all the previous vectors at each iteration . [ num2 ]    the transformation",
    "can also be applied to problems where either the band , or the impurity , have a more complex structure , as described in the following sections .",
    "the structure of the lanczos orbitals can be interpreted geometrically in a very simple way , for a system such as the square lattice .",
    "the reference site where the impurity is attached becomes a center of symmetry for the point group operations of the lattice , as shown in fig.[figure1 ] .",
    "since the hopping hamiltonian obeys the same symmetries , the lanczos orbitals will belong to the same symmetry sector as the seed orbital .",
    "if the impurity is attached locally to a single site of the lattice , and this site is chosen as seed , then all the lanczos orbitals will have `` @xmath13-wave '' symmetry , invariant under rotations of the lattice . strictly speaking ,",
    "since we are not in the continuum , this corresponds to the trivial @xmath45 representation of the group or rotations @xmath46 of the square lattice .",
    "all other _ channels _ , corresponding to different symmetry classes , will form their own independent chains , and will be completely decoupled from the impurity .",
    "this yields a remarkable result : in order to study a system with @xmath47 sites ( where @xmath1 is the linear size , and @xmath2 the dimensionality of the problem ) , we only need to keep @xmath48 orbitals !    to clarify these ideas let us illustrate with a simple example : we focus on the nearest neighbors around the center of symmetry , and we label the corresponding single particle orbitals as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , as shown in fig.[figure1](a ) .",
    "the first lanczos orbital is simply given by @xmath51.\\ ] ] there are three other single particle orbitals that are not coupled by the hamiltonian",
    ". we could define them as , for instance : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        where we have used the fact that the wavefunctions transform as the different irreducible representations of the point group .",
    "if we use these orbitals as seeds for the lanczos iterations , each will generate another chain , or channel , but they will be totally decoupled from each other , and from the original center of symmetry , since the hamiltonian will not mix different symmetry sectors .",
    "we can also see that as the distance from the center increases , the number of linearly independent wavefunctions that we can construct , and consequently , the number of channels will also increase .",
    "the orbitals are then defined by their symmetry sector , or channel , and their radial distance from the center of symmetry , which is correlated to the linear distance along the equivalent 1d chain .",
    "notice that in a bipartite lattice , odd and even sites along the chain will correspond to orbitals with support on different sublattices , a result that will become important in the interpretation of numerical results .    as a consequence of these observations",
    ", we obtain an intuitive understanding of the behavior of the entanglement : the entanglement _ per channel _ between the region enclosed by an area of `` radius '' @xmath1 in the @xmath2-dimensional problem is exactly the same as the entanglement between the first @xmath1 sites of the chain , and the rest . in cases where the system under consideration is gapless , the chain is a critical one - dimensional system ( for square and cubic lattices , for instance ) , and the von neumann entanglement entropy is proportional to @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "all channels contribute to the entropy with similar factors .",
    "it can be seen that the number of channels is proportional to the area of the boundary @xmath54 .",
    "this yields a final result proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , based on these simple arguments , we can easily understand why free fermions in higher - dimensions have logarithmic corrections to the area law@xcite .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we only need to solve the problem in the channel that is coupled to the impurity , reducing the entanglement by a factor of @xmath0 !",
    "notice that these ideas are basically a generalization of the one dimensional case studied in ref .  .",
    "in a one dimensional impurity problem , one can apply reflection symmetry and make a `` folding '' transformation , mapping the single particle orbitals onto bonding and antibonding states . in that case , the impurity couples only to the bonding channel , while the anti - bonding remains decoupled .",
    "this translates into a reduction of the entanglement by a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "we point out that in generic situations , the coupling between the impurity and the lattice could be along a different channel in a different symmetry sector . moreover , it could couple to more than one channel at the same time . tackling this problem",
    "is explained in the next section .",
    "as discussed above , one of the central issues in the canonical transformation is how to pick the right seed @xmath57 .",
    "this is determined by the chemistry of the problem , and therefore several situations may arise . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the impurity may be coupled to a single site , but , in a more general case , it may couple to many lattice sites . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , as an illustration , we show the case of one adatom in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the adatom can sit on top of one of the atoms of the lattice [ panel ( a ) ] , or at the center of an hexagon [ panels ( b ) and ( c ) ] . in this latter case ,",
    "depending on the hybridization with the lattice , the impurity may couple symmetrically to all six sites , as shown in panel ( b ) , or may be connected along the bond between two carbon atoms , as illustrated in panel ( c ) . the general expression for the impurity - lattice coupling hamiltonian",
    "is given by @xmath58 then , we define a renormalized orbital @xmath59 and rewrite the coupling hamiltonian as : @xmath60 where we have used the definition @xmath61 .",
    "now , the seed can be defined as @xmath62    although here we illustrate the method with the example of an adatom , it could be generalized to the case of a substitutional impurity , or defect .",
    "we have not considered the situation in which the impurity has more than one orbital .",
    "in such a case , the resulting problem would map on an impurity coupled to two chains .",
    "this problem will be studied in future work .",
    "notice that this is possible because the coupling hamiltonian has only one - body terms , such as is the case of anderson - type hamiltonians . for coupling hamiltonians containing many - body terms@xcite ,",
    "if the impurity is connected to more than one site , it is not possible to choose such a simple seed . in that case , the proper way to identify the coupling hamiltonian is by doing a schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "the seed to use in that case can be obtained through a generalization of the ideas above .",
    "= 7.5 cm      as a first benchmark test we present calculations of one - body properties for a system without impurities .",

    "however , the kondo physics on its own can not explain the strong finite - size dependence of the correlation length , which _ decreases _ as the system size _",
    "increases_. this seems to be a behavior dominated by the geometry of the problem . since we are working with finite systems , this situation corresponds to that of a kondo box , and indicates that we are far from the universal kondo regime .",
    "this physics undoubtedly deserves further investigation .",
    "note that we also performed calculations for an impurity attached to the edge of an armchair nanoribbon ( not shown here ) , essentially reproducing the same behavior .",
    "we proceed in the same way to analyze the case of zigzag nanoribbons , for the same model and parameters as in the previous section . in this instance , however , we need to differentiate the edge states from the bulk states of the nanoribbon . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , edge states are localized and bulk states are metallic . we study a system with an @xmath94 unit cell , placing the impurity at the edge for one simulation , and at the center for another .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] . in panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we show the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit for the spin correlation between the impurity and the first site of the chain , for an impurity located at the edge and at the center , respectively . for the case of the impurity attached to the edge of the zigzag nanoribbon , panel ( a )",
    ", we observe saturation at @xmath105 .",
    "the saturation is less well characterized than in the case of armchair insulating nanoribbons , likely due to the proximity of metallic bulk states . when the impurity is coupled to a site in the center of the nanoribbon , as shown in panel ( b ) , the correlations scale linearly in @xmath68 , as expected for the gapless case .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the spin - spin correlations between the impurity and the lanczos orbitals of the chain , as a function of the distance from the impurity .",
    "the results for the impurity at the center are plotted in ( d ) , showing similar behavior as the metallic armchair ribbon .",
    "remarkably , the correlations do not display a noticeable decay in the observed range .",
    "however , the finite - size effects are quite dramatic , as seen in the results for larger systems . as in the previous section , we attribute this behavior to the fact that we are in a kondo box , far from the universal kondo regime .",
    "in this work we propose a canonical transformation based on the lanczos method to map complex single particle band structures , onto equivalent 1d systems .",
    "we point out that even though the recursion method has been available for some time , its application has typically been limited to spectral properties of non - interacting systems @xcite .",
    "we introduce many - body interactions in the hamiltonian that require the use of appropriate techniques to solve the equivalent problem , such as dmrg , eca , or qmc . for the case of single impurities",
    ", this transformation preserves the form of the hybridization hamiltonian between the impurity and the lattice , and gives us the resolution to study the behavior of correlations in real space .",
    "we have shown that complex systems , like cnts , either metallic or with insulating gaps , or presenting van hove singularities , can be perfectly treated with this method . using dmrg ,",
    "we are able to study fairly large systems . as a benchmark and illustration",
    ", we show that large @xmath2-dimensional systems can be studied with little effort , once their band structure is mapped onto the effective 1d hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , we have studied adatoms on carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons .",
    "the complex and rich electronic properties of these systems , as well as their geometry , make them especially suitable for the application of our method .",
    "we can clearly distinguish between insulating and metallic regimes , or edge and bulk states , depending on the geometry of the system , and the position of the impurity .",
    "it is important to point out that extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit can not be taken trivially . on the one hand , when the system under study is insulating , correlations decay exponentially , and we can easily obtain thermodynamic results .",
    "however , this is not as simple for the case of impurity problems in metallic hosts .",
    "we work with finite systems , far from the universal kondo regime .",
    "this regime , when @xmath106 , can only be reached with nrg , a method that is precisely designed to study this limit . despite this , the short distance behavior can be obtained fairly accurately using our approach .    when treating finite lattices , we need to recall that we are working in a kondo - box , where the inter - level spacing of the discrete band structure introduces an additional energy scale into the problem .",
    "we point out that carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons _ are _ finite and could be relatively small in size .",
    "our method is ideal to capture the physics of these problems .    using the lanczos transformation on problems with many - body interactions and phonons",
    "can be done in a similar fashion@xcite , but the resulting hamiltonian will be quite complicated and non - local . an alternative is to introduce correlations at the dynamical mean field level , as proposed in ref .",
    "( see also ref . ) .    in principle , any quadratic hamiltonian can be mapped onto an equivalent 1d system following our prescription .",
    "this opens the doors to problems with spin - orbit interaction , and superconductors ( at the mean field / bdg level ) .",
    "possible applications of the mapping include topological insulators , where the bulk and the boundary have very different electronic properties @xcite .",
    "even though we have used dmrg to solve the effective one - dimensional hamiltonian , one could use alternative methods , such as eca , or qmc , as the problem has no sign problem .",
    "one could also use these techniques to study time - dependent @xcite , and thermodynamic properties @xcite , or to calculate spectral functions @xcite .",
    "the method can also become a powerful tool to study quantum chemistry problems in which a magnetic atom is embedded into a system that may be described by a hckel - like theory@xcite .",
    "moreover , one could use it in conjunction with ab - initio band structure calculations , incorporating the information about the bulk system into the effective 1d chain , and the hybridization terms in the structure of the seed state , paving the way toward realistic first principles modeling and a better understanding of correlation effects in quantum impurity problems .",
