    "in 1991 , after months of patient `` work '' and based on a study of @xmath3 events , a gang of players reached an amazing conclusion : in eight roulette wheels of the gran casino of madrid , six numbers ( @xmath4 and its two neighbors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the opposite number in the roulette wheel , @xmath7 , and its two neighbors , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) occurred with an unexpectedly high frequency ( assuming that each of the @xmath10 numbers of the roulette wheel appears with the same frequency ) , while four numbers ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) rarely occurred .",
    "the gang won a large amount of money by betting in these roulette wheels .",
    "the casino never realized where the problem was , never understood the `` method '' used by the gang but , after many attempts , found its own method to defeat the gang : the casino started to regularly exchange the pieces of the roulette wheels and switch the numbers positions .",
    "this altered the roulette wheels original `` defects '' and the gang stopped winning  @xcite .",
    "the moral is that any winning strategy usually has an antidote .    in 1999 , vaidman  @xcite converted mermin s  @xcite version of the proof of bell s theorem without inequalities discovered by greenberger , horne , and zeilinger ( ghz )  @xcite into a game involving a team ( a gang ) of three players , each of them completely isolated in a booth , and an opponent ( a casino ) . under some assumptions , and using only classical resources ,",
    "the maximum probability for the team to win vaidman s game is 75% ( thus a casino gets profit by exploiting the remaining 25% ) .",
    "thanks to the fact that rules of the game do not forbid the players to share qubits prepared in some entangled state , there is a method which allows them to always win the game .",
    "however , there is a simple manipulation that nullifies the quantum advantage .",
    "a hidden assumption of the method is that all three players share a common reference frame .",
    "if the casino disorientates one of the players so that all three of them do not share a reference frame , then the advantage of the method is lost .",
    "the term `` unspeakable information '' was coined by peres and scudo  @xcite to designate information that can not be represented by a sequence of discrete symbols , such as a direction in space or a reference frame . in this paper",
    "we show that there is a method to always win vaidman s game without it being necessary that the players share unspeakable information .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we review the rules of vaidman s game and the original quantum method for always winning . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we propose a quantum method for always winning , even if the players do not share any reference frame .",
    "this method requires more qubits , and thus one might think that it must require collective measurements on several qubits , instead of single - qubit measurements , as in the original method ; in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we shall see that this is not the case . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we show other applications of the method .",
    "vaidman proposed the following game  @xcite .",
    "consider a team of three players , who are allowed to agree on a common strategy and make any preparation before they are taken to three remote and isolated booths .",
    "then , each player is asked one of the two possible questions : `` what is @xmath15 ? '' or `` what is @xmath16 ? ''",
    "each player must give an answer which is limited to one of only two possibilities :  `` @xmath17 '' or  `` @xmath4 . ''",
    "one of the rules of the game is that either all three players are asked the  @xmath15 question or only one player is asked the  @xmath15 question and the other two are asked the  @xmath16 question .",
    "the team wins if the number of  @xmath17 answers is odd ( one or three ) in the case of three  @xmath15  questions , and is even ( zero or two ) in the case of one  @xmath15 and two  @xmath16  questions .    assuming that the four possible combinations of questions ( i.e. , @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ; and  @xmath21 ) are asked with the same frequency , no classical protocol allows the players to win the game in more than  75% of the runs .",
    "for instance , a simple strategy that allows them to win in  75% of the runs is that each player always answers  @xmath4 to the  @xmath15 question and  @xmath17 to the  @xmath16 question .",
    "however , quantum mechanics provides a method to always win the game .",
    "the method for always winning is the following . before entering the isolated booths ,",
    "the players prepare a large number of three - qubit systems in the ghz state  @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then , for each three - qubit system , each of the players takes one of the qubits with him . in case a player is asked `` what is @xmath15 ? , '' he performs a measurement on his qubit of the observable represented by @xmath28 and gives the answer  @xmath17 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath29 , or the answer  @xmath4 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath30 .    in case a player is asked `` what is  @xmath16 ? , '' he performs a measurement of the observable represented by @xmath31 where  @xmath32 , or the answer  @xmath4 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath33 .",
    "the protocol described above allows the team to always win the game , because the state defined in eq .",
    "( [ ghz03 ] ) can also be expressed in the following four forms : @xmath34 it can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ zzz ] ) that , if all players measure  @xmath15 , then either all of them will obtain  @xmath35 or one will obtain  @xmath35 and the other two will obtain  @xmath36 .",
    "analogously , it can be inferred from eqs .",
    "( [ zxx])([xxz ] ) that , if one player measures  @xmath15 and the other two measure  @xmath16 , then either all of them will obtain  @xmath4 , or one will obtain  @xmath4 and the other two will obtain  @xmath17 .",
    "the method described above has one drawback that the adversary could use to keep the players from always winning . if the qubits are spin states of spin-@xmath37 particles , then the observables  @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be identified , respectively , with the spin components along two orthogonal directions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "such directions are determined by the preparation of the ghz state  ( [ ghz03 ] ) .",
    "this method requires all players to share the directions @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the duration of the game .",
    "however , if the opponent finds a way to confuse one of them , then the local measurements performed by the players will not be adequately correlated and thus the advantage provided by the ghz state is lost .",
    "fortunately , there is a method which is still valid even if the players do not share two directions .",
    "now , before entering the booths , the players prepare a large number of 12-qubit systems in the state @xmath40 where @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the four - qubit states @xmath44 introduced by kempe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of decoherence - free fault - tolerant universal quantum computation  @xcite , and recently obtained experimentally using parametric down - converted polarization - entangled photons  @xcite .",
    "then , for each 12-qubit system , the first player takes the first _ four _ qubits with him , the second player takes the next four qubits , and the third player takes the last four qubits . in case a player is asked `` what is @xmath15 ? , '' he performs on his four qubits a measurement of the observable represented by @xmath45 the observable @xmath46 has _",
    "three _ possible outcomes ( corresponding to its three eigenvalues , @xmath47 , @xmath17 , and @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , if the qubits have been prepared in the state @xmath48 given in eq .",
    "( [ ghz12 ] ) , then only two outcomes can occur ( those corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath47 and @xmath4 ) . measuring",
    "the observable @xmath46 on a system prepared in the state @xmath48 is then equivalent to reliably discriminating between the states  @xmath42 and  @xmath43 .",
    "the player gives the answer  @xmath17 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath42 , and the answer  @xmath4 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath43 .    in case",
    "a player is asked `` what is  @xmath16 ? , '' he performs a measurement of the observable represented by @xmath49 where @xmath50 measuring @xmath51 on a system prepared in the state  @xmath52 is equivalent to reliably discriminating between  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 .",
    "the player gives the answer  @xmath17 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath53 , or the answer  @xmath4 , if the outcome corresponds to  @xmath54 .",
    "the state @xmath48 can be expressed in the following four forms : @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ zzz ] ) , it can be inferred that if the three players perform measurements to discriminate between  @xmath42 and  @xmath43 , then they will always obtain an odd number of states  @xmath42 . from eqs .",
    "( [ zxx ] ) to ( [ xxz ] ) , it can be inferred that , if two players perform measurements to discriminate between  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 , and the third performs measurements to discriminate between  @xmath42 and  @xmath43 , then they will always obtain an odd number of states  @xmath54 and  @xmath43 .    for our purposes",
    ", the fundamental property of the state @xmath52 is that it is invariant under any transformation @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 , where @xmath2 is a unitary operation on a single qubit ) .",
    "this property derives from the fact that @xmath42 and @xmath43 and any linear combination thereof ( such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are invariant under the tensor product of four equal unitary operators , @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the state @xmath52 is invariant under local rotations , and the local observables @xmath46 and @xmath51 are invariant under @xmath59 and thus under rotations of the local setups @xcite .",
    "therefore , expressions  ( [ zzz])([xxz ] ) remain unchanged after local rotations .",
    "this implies that even if the adversary disorientates one or more players , the outcomes of the local measurements still possess the desired correlations , because the involved local measurements are rotationally invariant .",
    "one might think that measuring @xmath46 ( i.e. , distinguishing between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and @xmath51 ( i.e. , distinguishing between @xmath53 and @xmath60 ) could require collective measurements on each player s four qubits .",
    "however , as in the original method , only single - qubit measurements are needed .",
    "the states @xmath42 and @xmath43 are reliably distinguishable using single - qubit measurements because they can be expressed as @xmath61 therefore , if the local measurements are @xmath62 ( i.e. , the component along the @xmath38  direction of the first qubit ) , @xmath63 ( i.e. , the component along the @xmath38  direction of the second qubit ) , @xmath64 ( i.e. , the component along the @xmath39  direction of the third qubit ) , and @xmath65 ( i.e. , the component along the @xmath39  direction of the fourth qubit ) then , among the  @xmath66 possible outcomes ,  @xmath7 occur ( with equal probability ) only if the qubits were in the state @xmath42 , and the other  @xmath12 outcomes occur ( with equal probability ) only if the qubits were in the state @xmath43 . note that now @xmath38 and @xmath39 are not fixed directions , but any two orthogonal directions instead .",
    "this scheme to distinguish between @xmath42 and @xmath43 using only single - qubit measurements has recently been experimentally implemented  @xcite .",
    "the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not distinguishable using _ fixed _ single - qubit measurements . however , any two orthogonal states are distinguishable by single - qubit measurements _ assisted by classical communication _  @xcite .",
    "this means that there is a _ sequence _ of single - qubit measurements which allows us to reliably distinguish between @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this sequence , what is measured on one qubit could depend on the result of a prior measurement on a different qubit . a sequence of single - qubit measurements which allows us to reliably distinguish between @xmath53 and @xmath54 follows from the fact that these states can be expressed as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 note that , for instance , the state @xmath70 is _ not _ orthogonal to @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "the comparison between expressions  ( [ psi0loc ] ) and  ( [ psi1loc ] ) leads us to a simple protocol for reliably distinguishing between @xmath73 and @xmath54 using a sequence of single - qubit measurements .",
    "this protocol is shown in fig .",
    "[ flow02 ] .     protocol for reliably distinguishing @xmath53 and @xmath54 using a sequence of single - qubit measurements .",
    "example : first , measure @xmath15 on qubit  @xmath4 and @xmath16 on qubit  @xmath74 .",
    "if the results are , respectively , @xmath35 and @xmath75 , then measure the observable represented by @xmath76 on qubit  @xmath77 .",
    "if the result is @xmath78 , then measure the observable @xmath79 on qubit  @xmath7 .",
    "if the result is @xmath80 , then the state is @xmath54.,width=325 ]",
    "vaidman s aim was to reformulate the ghz proof of bell s theorem into a game `` which can convert laymen into admirers of quantum theory '' by showing its `` miraculous power ''  @xcite .",
    "one obvious application of the method for always winning vaidman s game introduced in this paper is thus to prove bell s theorem without inequalities when the local observers do not share any reference frame . according to eqs .",
    "( [ zzz])([xxz ] ) , one can predict with certainty the value of either @xmath81 or @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 ) from the results of spacelike separated measurements on the other two four - qubit systems . therefore , for any @xmath84 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be considered `` elements of reality , '' as defined by einstein , podolsky , and rosen  @xcite .",
    "however , it is impossible to assign predefined values , either @xmath17 or @xmath4 , to the six observables @xmath81 and @xmath82 satisfying all predictions given by eqs .",
    "( [ zzz])([xxz ] ) .",
    "this proof is of interest , since it shows that a perfect alignment between the source of entangled states and the local detectors does not play a fundamental role in bell s theorem .",
    "for instance , in 1988 yuval neeman argued that the answer to the puzzle posed by bell s theorem was to be found in the implicit assumption that the detectors were aligned .",
    "neeman apparently believed that the two detectors were connected through the space - time affine connection of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "a proof of bell s theorem without inequalities and without alignments involving two observers , eight - qubit states , and only fixed single - qubit measurements ( i.e. , without requiring a protocol like the one in fig .",
    "[ flow02 ] ) has been introduced in ref .",
    "the interest of the proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for the state  @xmath48 , given in eq .",
    "( [ ghz12 ] ) , and the local measurements of @xmath46 and @xmath51 , defined respectively in eqs .",
    "( [ calz ] ) and ( [ calx ] ) , is that such a proof is valid for 100% of the events prepared in the state  @xmath48 , instead of only for a small ( 8% ) subset of the events in ref .",
    ".    other interesting application of the state @xmath48 and the local observables @xmath46 and @xmath51 is the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem of impossibility of noncontextual hidden variables in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "mermin showed how the ghz proof of bell s theorem could be converted into a proof of the ks theorem  @xcite .",
    "analogously , the proof of bell s theorem using @xmath48 , @xmath46 , and @xmath51 could be converted into a ( subspace - dependent ) proof of the ks theorem , valid even for measurements along imperfectly defined directions .",
    "this is of interest , because it sheds some extra light on a recent debate about whether or not the ks theorem is still valid when ideal measurements are replaced by imperfect measurements  @xcite .",
    "vaidman s game can also be seen as a scenario in which the communication complexity of a certain task can be reduced if the players are allowed to share some prior entangled state . in vaidman",
    "s game the task is to always win the game . without quantum resources , this task requires at least one of the players to send @xmath4  bit to other player after the question ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) has been posed to him .",
    "however , if they initially share a ghz state , the task does not require any transmission of classical information between the players .",
    "a similar example of reduction of the communication complexity needed for a task if the parties share a ghz state was discovered by cleve and buhrman  @xcite , reformulated by buhrman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and attractively presented by steane and van dam  @xcite as follows : a secret integer number @xmath85 of apples , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath4 , or @xmath88 , is distributed among three players , alice , bob , and charlie , of the same team .",
    "each of them is in an isolated booth .",
    "the team wins if one of the players , alice , can ascertain whether the total number of distributed apples is even or odd .",
    "the only communication allowed is that each of the other two players can send @xmath4  bit to alice after seeing the number of apples each of them got . assuming that each of the  @xmath89 possible variations of apples occurs with the same probability and using only classical communication",
    ", alice can not guess the correct answer in more than  75% of the cases .",
    "however , the players can always win if each has a qubit of a trio prepared in the state @xmath90 given in eq .",
    "( [ ghz03 ] ) , and each player  @xmath84 applies to his qubit the rotation @xmath91 where @xmath92 is his number of apples , and then measures the spin of his qubit along the @xmath38  direction .",
    "finally , bob and charlie send their outcomes to alice .",
    "the success of the method is guaranteed by the following property : @xmath93 where @xmath94 can be reliably distinguished from @xmath90 by local measurements along the @xmath38  direction .",
    "this method assumes that all players _ share a reference frame _ during the protocol .",
    "however , such an assumption is not needed if each player replaces his qubit belonging to a trio prepared in  @xmath90 by four qubits belonging to a dozen prepared in  @xmath48 .",
    "the local operations [ i.e. , the rotation @xmath95 and the measurement along the @xmath38  direction ] are replaced by a protocol , using only single - qubit measurements , for reliably distinguishing between two four - particle states which are invariant under @xmath58 .",
    "other application in which the use of ghz states provides advantages over any classical protocol is the secret sharing scenario  @xcite : alice wishes to convey a cryptographic key to bob and charlie in such a way that they both can read it only if they cooperate .",
    "in addition , they wish to prevent any eavesdropper from acquiring any information without being detected .",
    "it is assumed that the players share no previous secret information nor any secure classical channel but , although it is not usually explicitly stated , it is assumed that all three parties _ share a reference frame_. once more , such a requirement can be removed if we replace the ghz state with the state  @xmath48 , and the measurements of  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 with measurements of @xmath46 and @xmath51 .      to sum up , the interest in rotationally invariant states ( i.e. , those invariant under @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a unitary operation ) goes beyond their use for decoherence - free fault - tolerant universal quantum computation  @xcite , solving the byzantine agreement problem  @xcite , and transmitting classical and quantum information between parties who do not share a reference frame  @xcite .",
    "_ entangled _ rotationally invariant states ( i.e. , those invariant under @xmath98 ) , like the state @xmath48 given in eq .",
    "( [ ghz12 ] ) , can be used to overcome certain assumptions in the proofs of nonexistence of hidden variables , can be applied to reduce the communication complexity of certain tasks , even if the parties do not share any reference frame , and to distribute secret keys among parties who do not share unspeakable information .",
    "this paper was sparked by a question raised by h.  weinfurter about the possibility of developing a ghz - like proof of bell s theorem involving observers who do not share a reference frame and using only single - qubit measurements .",
