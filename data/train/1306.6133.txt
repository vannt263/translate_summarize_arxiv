    "there is currently a surge of interest in alternative computing paradigms @xcite that can outperform or outright replace the present von neumann one @xcite .",
    "it is clear that such alternatives have to fundamentally depart from the existing one in both their execution speed as well in the way they handle information . for at least a couple of decades , quantum computing @xcite ( qc )",
    "has been considered a promising such alternative , in view of its intrinsic massive parallelism afforded by the superposition principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the range of qc applications is limited to a few problems such as integer factorization @xcite and search @xcite .    in order to obtain a paradigm shift",
    "we then need to look somewhere else but no farther than our own brain .",
    "this amazing computing machine is particularly suited for massively - parallel computation .",
    "it is polymorphic , in the sense that it can perform different operations depending on the input from the environment , and its storing and computing units  the neurons and their connections , synapses @xcite  are the _ same _ physical object .",
    "such a brain - inspired computing paradigm has been named _ memcomputing _ @xcite and relies on resistors @xcite , capacitors or inductors with memory ( collectively called memelements ) @xcite both to store the data and to perform the computation .",
    "the features of memelements that make them very attractive from a practical point of view are : _ i _ ) they are a natural by - product of the continued miniaturization of electronic devices , and _ ii _ ) they can be readily fabricated @xcite making memcomputing a realistic possibility .",
    "this work reports a memcomputing implementation based on solid - state memcapacitive systems @xcite ( capacitors with memory ) .",
    "while previous memcomputing schemes @xcite employ intrinsically dissipative memristive devices @xcite ( resistors with memory ) , we take advantage of very low power dissipation in memcapacitive systems @xcite to build a _ dynamic computing random access memory _ ( dcram ) capable of storing information and performing polymorphic logic computation .",
    "this new platform allows for massively - parallel logic operations directly in memory thus offering a starting point for a practical solution to the von neumann bottleneck problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , we would like to emphasize that our idea is not limited to the specific type of memcapacitive systems used for model calculations reported in this work .",
    "for example , ferroelectric capacitors @xcite used in feram @xcite and currently evaluated for new dram solutions are also promising candidates for dcram .        while the general topology of dcram ( fig .",
    "[ dcram ] ) is similar to that of conventional dynamic random access memory ( dram ) , its memory cells are solid - state memcapacitive systems @xcite .",
    "these are multilayer structures composed of insulating layers ( three in the particular realization we consider here ) alternated by metal layers .",
    "the most external insulating layers are made of high-@xmath0 materials with very high potential barrier so that negligible charge can pass trough them . on the other hand ,",
    "the intermediate layer is formed out of a low-@xmath0 material with low potential barrier .",
    "this choice allows for non - negligible charge migration between two internal metal layers at appropriate bias conditions .",
    "if the middle insulator layer is thin enough , the internal charge current is due to quantum tunnelling @xcite and can be easily tuned over a wide range of values @xcite .",
    "although no prototype of solid - state memcapacitive systems has been realized yet , we point out that its actual realization oriented to vlsi circuits may not be of a simple planar geometry .",
    "in fact , dram capacitors are normally of cylindrical shape .",
    "consequently , a possible realization of solid - state memcapacitive systems could consist of three cylindrical capacitors forming an effective solid - state memcapacitive system .",
    "the capacitance @xmath1 of the solid - state memcapacitive system we consider here is defined using the standard relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the charge on the capacitor plates ( external metal layers ) and @xmath4 is the voltage applied to the system .",
    "importantly , @xmath1 is a function of the internal state , namely , it depends on the ratio @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the internal charge ( see the top left inset in fig .  [ response ] below ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 can diverge and take negative values @xcite leading to a variety of transient responses .",
    "the internal memory of the memcapacitive system @xcite arises from the delay of the internal charge response caused by a tunneling barrier of the central insulator layer @xcite .",
    "the tunneling barrier can be lowered by a voltage bias applied to the capacitor plates . in this case , a finite internal current ( between the internal metal layers ) changing @xmath6 is possible .",
    "the internal charge @xmath6 becomes trapped when the shape of the potential barrier is restored .",
    "therefore , the applied voltage pulses can be used to control the internal charge @xmath6 , which can be subsequently stored . here",
    "we discuss the features of the solid - state memcapacitor as proposed in @xcite , using realistic values of parameters compatible with the 2012 international technology roadmap for semiconductors ( itrs ) specifications @xcite . from itrs 2012 ,",
    "the capacity of dram cell is about @xmath7 ff and the equivalent oxide thickness ( eot ) is @xmath8 nm for a high-@xmath9 material of @xmath10 .",
    "a rapid calculation shows that the area of the metallic layers of an _ equivalent _ planar capacitor ( common geometries for dram capacitors are not in general planar , several complex geometries , e.g. , cylindrical or pedestal structures , are employed by different manufacturers ) has to be of the order of @xmath11 @xmath12m@xmath13 , so we use this value in our simulations",
    ". moreover , the physical thickness of the insulator , from the eot and @xmath10 , ranges between @xmath14 nm . using these data",
    ", we consider the memcapacitor structure sketched in fig .",
    "[ dcram ] .",
    "the thickness of the two high-@xmath9 insulators is supposed to be @xmath15 nm and we assume they are made of standard modern high - k material ( e.g. tio@xmath16 ) with @xmath10 . finally in our simulations we consider transmission lines with common values for dram fabrication , i.e. , @xmath17 k@xmath18 mm@xmath19 and @xmath20 pf mm@xmath19 for a length of @xmath21 mm .",
    "physical parameters ( thickness and @xmath9 value ) of the low-@xmath9 layer require a more careful consideration since the lifetime of @xmath6 strongly depends on these two parameters .",
    "let us then focus on the _ storage mode _ , namely , the situation that follows a write operation ( application of 1 ns voltage pulse of certain amplitude ) . in order to model the least favorable conditions such as a strong external leakage current ( due to imperfect switches and other processes ) , we assume @xmath22 irrespective of the written bit .",
    "this choice is different from that in common dram where , in the storage mode , @xmath23 if the stored bit is 1 and @xmath22 if it is 0 . our main goal here is to evaluate the possibility of information storage on long time scales compared to typical dram decay times using , however , dram - like chip structure .    let us consider a physical model of solid - state memcapacitive system with a barrier height of 0.2 ev for the low-@xmath9 material and infinite barrier for the high-@xmath9 one .",
    "the equations governing the time variation of @xmath6 and @xmath3 can be written as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the tunnel current through the low-@xmath9 material , @xmath26 is the ( constant ) capacitance of the total memcapacitive system ( with respect to @xmath3 only ) and @xmath27 is the capacitance of the internal capacitor composed by the low-@xmath9 material and internal metal layers . if the barrier is sufficiently thin then the current can be approximated by the simmons formula @xcite .",
    "taking into account that @xmath28 and @xmath25 is monotonous with a unique @xmath29 at @xmath30 , there is unique steady - state solution @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "the top inset in fig .",
    "[ optimization ] shows that the current @xmath33 is very small at smaller values of @xmath34 suggesting the possibility of quite low charge relaxation rate at nonzero @xmath6 . at @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ dqdt ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath35 this equation describes the decay of the internal charge @xmath6 in the storage mode .",
    "[ optimization ] shows the decay of @xmath6 for several values of @xmath9 and layer thicknesses .",
    "it is worth noticing that at certain values of parameters , such as the thickness of 10 nm and @xmath36 , the information is stored for a long time .",
    "in fact , after @xmath37 s ( about @xmath38 days ) a reasonable amount of charge still remains in the memcapacitive system .",
    "thus , modifying the parameters of the memory cell ( the layer thickness , dielectric constant or even the barrier height ) one can select an appropriate lifetime of the internal charge @xmath6 .",
    "in our scheme , the binary information is encoded in the internal charge @xmath6 of the memcapacitive system .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath39 corresponds to logic @xmath21 , @xmath40 corresponds to logic @xmath29 , and the logic value is not defined when @xmath41 . the threshold @xmath42 is introduced to reliably distinguish logic values , and as such is defined according to the sensitivity of the voltage sense amplifiers ( vsa ) that we exploit to allow for the bit value detection .    when a voltage pulse is applied to a memory cell ,",
    "its current response strongly depends on its internal charge @xmath6 .",
    "we thus use this current response to read the information stored in the memory cell : the common solution ( widely used in consumer electronics including standard dram technology ) employs vsas .        as depicted in fig .",
    "[ vsa ] , the vsa is connected to the memory cell in series with a voltage pulse generator .",
    "the ideal characteristics of the vsa are presented in the left bottom inset of fig .",
    "it is important to know that vsa amplifies the response voltage @xmath43 if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a certain threshold voltage .",
    "generally , the delayed response of vsas is associated to the internal capacitances of the metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) structures they are made of . during the delay time , the voltage pulse generator induces the response voltage @xmath43 .",
    "being amplified , @xmath43 provides the value stored in the memory cell .    single cell response to a voltage pulse",
    "under read / write conditions as described in fig .",
    "[ dcram ] . in our simulations , the bit and dual bit lines are modeled as transmission lines with typical parameters for dram @xmath17 k@xmath18mm@xmath19 and @xmath20 pfmm@xmath19 assuming @xmath21 mm line length . the voltage pulse is a smooth square pulse of @xmath21 v amplitude and @xmath21 ns width starting at @xmath46 ns . the main graph is the current response measured at the end of the bit line for several initial values of the internal charge @xmath6 .",
    "the red line refers to @xmath47 initial condition . to quantify @xmath6 , an effective internal voltage difference ( ivd )",
    "is defined as @xmath48 with @xmath49 the geometrical capacitance of the intermediate layer , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the surface area , @xmath52 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath53 is the relative permittivity of the central layer , and @xmath54 is its thickness .",
    "the top right inset shows the cell s dissipated energy .",
    "bottom left inset : the effective internal voltage difference as a function of voltage pulse amplitude in @xmath21 s after the voltage pulse application . ]",
    "the write , read and logic operations with memcapacitive memory cells are performed with the help of control circuitry that provides appropriate signals . in order to make the discussion even more realistic , the parameters we have used throughout the simulations belong to the itrs 2012 standards @xcite .",
    "simulations have been carried out using the general purpose in - house nostos ( nonlinear circuit and system orbit stability ) simulator developed by one of the authors ( flt ) initially for studying circuit stability @xcite , and recently extended to analyze circuits including memory elements @xcite .",
    "let us consider the write operation first .",
    "for this purpose , we employ the circuit configuration shown in the top right corner of fig .",
    "[ dcram ] where the dual bit line ( dbl ) is grounded and the voltage pulse is applied to the bit line ( bl ) . as it is mentioned above ,",
    "applied voltage pulse lowers the potential barrier between the internal metal layers allowing for an internal charge redistribution .",
    "an important observation that one can make at this point is that the write process is of the threshold type .",
    "indeed , one can define a threshold voltage @xmath55 such that there is no significant charge transfer between the internal plates at applied voltage amplitudes below @xmath55 ( see the bottom left inset in fig .",
    "[ response ] ) . on the contrary , at pulse amplitudes exceeding @xmath55 a considerable amount of charge can tunnel between the internal layers . in our device structure ,",
    "@xmath55 is about @xmath8 v , which is much larger than the perturbations usually induced by mos transistor leakage currents . moreover ,",
    "the existence of @xmath55 results also in an internal charge saturation shown in the bottom left inset of fig .",
    "[ response ] .",
    "next , let us consider the read operation in dcram . similarly to dram , the read process is destructive ( see the top right plot of fig .",
    "[ vsa ] : when the voltage pulse acts , the information inside the memory cell is destroyed since the final state inside the memory cell is 1 ) and thus needs to be followed by a refresh operation . in order to have a better understanding , we consider the current response shown in fig .  [ response ] .",
    "one can notice significant variations in the cell response depending on the initial value of @xmath6 .",
    "these differences are used to measure the logic value stored in the cell with vsas similarly to dram technology .",
    "however , vsa amplifies a voltage difference above or below a certain voltage threshold . to meet the vsa modus operandi ,",
    "the current response can be transformed into the voltage response connecting the bit and dual bit lines to vsa input terminals . as the voltage pulse used in read changes the internal charge @xmath6",
    ", a suitable refresh operation is applied after the read .        in summary ,",
    "the sequence consists of two steps .",
    "first , a voltage pulse ( in our simulations , of @xmath8 ns length and @xmath21 v amplitude ) is applied by the generator .",
    "it produces a voltage response that is considered as input for vsa during its delay state .",
    "subsequently , if @xmath44 the vsa amplifies the voltage @xmath43 and 0 is written , on the contrary , if @xmath56 the vsa does not act and 1 is written .",
    "[ vsa ] reports simulations of the read - refresh process considering an extreme case of a partially decayed bit showing all the features mentioned above .",
    "moreover , we would like to emphasize that the dissipated energy has a significant dependence on the value of bit ( 0 or 1 ) .",
    "this is due to an asymmetry in vsa response .",
    "in fact , when @xmath44 ( vsa is activated ) the dissipated energy is about @xmath57 fj . in the opposite case",
    "( initial value is @xmath21 ) this energy is about 1 fj .    the top right inset of fig .  [ response ] shows the dissipated energy when a pulse of 1 ns length and 1 v amplitude is applied .",
    "in fact , this calculation gives a reference for the order of magnitude of the dissipated energy for all dcram operations ( write , read , computation ) because of close operating conditions .",
    "it is worth noticing that this energy is of the order of few fj , comparable to the best cases of extremely low - energy storage and computation @xcite , and computation only with cmos architectures @xcite .",
    "importantly , the information is stored directly in dcram saving the power usually needed to transfer it to / from the cpu .",
    "time variation of ivd and dissipated energy for the second logic gate of figure  [ computation ] .",
    "the voltage pulse amplitudes are @xmath58 v and @xmath59 v , and the pulse length is 1 ns . the evolution of ivd for both memory cells at different initial conditions are shown by different line styles in ( a ) and ( c ) . the dissipated energy is plotted in ( b ) and ( d ) . ]    let us consider the simplest realization of logic gates when 2 memory cells are used to store the input and ( after the computation ) the output values . for computation purposes ,",
    "these memory cells are coupled as shown in fig .  [ computation ] using appropriate switches at the end of the bl and dbl . as shown in fig .",
    "[ computation ] , the dynamics of the internal charges @xmath6 of two coupled cells subjected to a couple of synchronized voltage pulses depends on the initial combination of internal charges of these cells . in this way , the final values of the internal charges can be considered as a result of a logic operation over initial values stored at @xmath60 in these cells ( see fig .",
    "[ computation ] ) . as a specific example , let us consider configuration 2 from fig .  [ computation ] assuming that @xmath61 v and @xmath62 v amplitude voltage pulses are applied to the memory cells .",
    "[ computation1 ] demonstrates the evolution of @xmath6 for both cells .",
    "notice that the final values of @xmath6 in cells a and b realize or and and gates , respectively .",
    "the dissipated energy ( bottom plots in fig .  [ computation1 ] ) is quite low : it is less than @xmath63 fj in the worst case scenario , and , in the case of ( @xmath21 , @xmath29 ) initial configuration , it is much lower .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that , after computation ( see fig .",
    "[ computation1 ] ) , the bits stored in the cells are only partially written : the computation process must be completed by a refresh process , thus increasing the total required energy per operation by a few fj , depending on the actual realization of vsa .",
    "considering possible connections and device polarities one can find that two coupled cells can be used to form a ( redundant ) basis for a _ complete set of logic operations_. in fact , it is known @xcite that combining only and and not or or and not functions , any logic expression can be evaluated . in our case , with two coupled memory cells we can in fact perform 6 different two - bit operations , depending both on how the cells are coupled , and on the amplitudes of the applied voltage pulses .",
    "therefore , these two coupled memory cells form universal logic gates as it is exhaustively proved below .",
    "the universal gate offered by the dcram architecture is not its only advantage .",
    "dcram is capable of intrinsically _ parallel _ computation .",
    "in fact , after only one computation step , we find a different output on each memcapacitive system : this means two operations at the same time .",
    "as shown later , by connecting three memory cells and varying the pulse amplitudes and the connection topology , we can perform even more complex operations in one step , and obtain three different outputs written into each memory cell .",
    "more importantly , one can perform simultaneous operations over multiple groups of two or three coupled cells .",

    "shows how to perform all possible two - bit logic operations using dcram gates .",
    "we notice that in the worst case scenario , a three - bit registry ( three cells ) is needed ( the third bit , initially set to @xmath21 , is used to perform negation ) , and a two - level operation is required . compared with cmos nand logic or nor logic ,",

    "this is performed by transferring a significant amount of data processing directly into the memory , where the data is stored .",
    "although it is still an open question which specific algorithms will mostly benefit from such an approach , we expect that our scheme will be extremely useful in scientific calculations , image and video processing and similar tasks .    in order to make a specific estimation of computation speed - up using our approach ,",
    "let us compare a performance of a traditional personal computer equipped with typical dram chips with this of a dcram - based computer .",
    "for example , consider a 4 gb memory system , with two 2 gb ranks , each consisting of eight 256 mbx8 , 4-bank devices @xcite .",
    "moreover , each of the 4 banks in a 256 mb device is split into 8 arrays of 8 mb each .",
    "if there are 65,536 rows of 1024 columns of bits in each array , a row access provides a selection of 1024 bits per array , giving a total of 65,536 bits across 8 chips of 8 arrays each .",
    "this is the number of bits that can be involved simultaneously in a _",
    "parallel calculation using dcram , which lasts for about 20 ns ( accounting for a 4-level computation ) as discussed above ( here we assume that all 65,536 bits are grouped into small few - bits circuits at each calculation step ) .",
    "on the other hand , a standard cpu processes 64 bits per each clock cycle .",
    "accounting for the memory access time of 10 ns @xcite , we can conclude from this simple example that a dcram could be in principle up to 1000 times faster than the usual von neumann architecture .    finally , we emphasize again that an actual realization of dcram is not limited to the employment of solid - state memcapacitive systems considered in this work .",
    "other memcapacitive systems could serve as even better solutions for practical implementations of dcram .",
    "we thus hope that our results will be of interest to a wide community of researchers and lead to the next generation of brain - like computing memory .",

    "<S> the present von neumann computing paradigm involves a significant amount of information transfer between a central processing unit ( cpu ) and memory , with concomitant limitations in the actual execution speed . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been recently argued that a different form of computation , dubbed _ memcomputing _ [ _ nature physics _ * 9 * , 200 - 202 ( 2013 ) ] and inspired by the operation of our brain , can resolve the intrinsic limitations of present day architectures by allowing for computing _ and _ storing of information on the _ same _ physical platform . </S>",
    "<S> here we show a simple and practical realization of memcomputing that utilizes easy - to - build memcapacitive systems . </S>",
    "<S> we name this architecture dynamic computing random access memory ( dcram ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that dcram provides _ massively - parallel _ and _ polymorphic _ digital logic , namely it allows for different logic operations with the same architecture , by varying only the control signals . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by taking into account realistic parameters , its energy expenditures can be as low as a few fj per operation . </S>",
    "<S> dcram is fully compatible with cmos technology , can be realized with current fabrication facilities , and therefore can really serve as an alternative to the present computing technology . </S>"
