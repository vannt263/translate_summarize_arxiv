    "for some time flux tube models @xcite and wilson loop expansion calculations @xcite have been used to understand hadron states .",
    "the usual assumption is that the color field can be taken to lie on straight lines connecting the quarks .",
    "this `` straight line '' or `` rigid '' flux configuration is in the spirit of an adiabatic or born - oppenheimer approximation that is assumed to hold at least for slowly moving quarks .",
    "nesterenko @xcite points out that this adiabatic approximation can not be valid if the quark has angular acceleration .",
    "the argument is based on a classic theorem of ruled surfaces .",
    "the nambu - goto string action requires the string to sweep out a surface of minimal area .",
    "catalan s theorem @xcite states that if the string is straight there is only one minimal surface swept out ; a helicoid .",
    "this surface describes a meson state consisting of uniformly rotating quarks .",
    "as we will observe , a straight string with the end moving radially also sweeps out a minimal surface as long as the angular velocity is constant .",
    "this solution does not correspond to the motion of an actual meson since the quark plus string angular momentum is not conserved .",
    "however , one may take the point of view that the string shape can be studied with arbitrary end motion , such as caused by an arbitrary external force acting on the ends .",
    "the motion of the string with quarks at the ends is then a special case . in this paper",
    "we use the rigidly rotating solution as our starting point and consider angular acceleration of the endpoints as a perturbation .",
    "a rigidly rotating string with its endpoint quarks moving in perfectly circular orbits is not a realistic model for meson because quantum mechanics requires there to be some radial motion , and by angular momentum conservation , some angular acceleration as well .",
    "the string must be curved if it is to sweep out a minimal area while its endpoints undergo angular acceleration .",
    "we will discuss here the shape of the curved string and conclude that small curvatures do not change its dynamics .",
    "this result holds even for relativistic string motion .    in section [ sec : ng ]",
    "we define our notation for the nambu - goto action and obtain the string wave equation , angular momentum and energy relations .",
    "we also establish exact straight string solutions with arbitrary radial motion but constant angular velocity .",
    "an intuitive picture of a non - relativistic string is developed in section [ sec : nrstring ] .",
    "the relativistic shape equation and solutions for small angular acceleration are established in section [ sec : relstring ] .",
    "we demonstrate numerically in section [ sec : validity ] that size of the string deformations is small and therefore that the perturbative approach is sound .",
    "the angular momentum and energy for the curved string are considered in section [ sec : constants ] and our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the string action is proportional to the string tension @xmath0 and to the area swept out by the string .",
    "it is conventionally written in polyakov @xcite form as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a two - dimensional metric auxiliary field whose indices run over @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the string position and @xmath7 .",
    "the action is invariant under reparametrization of the coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and under weyl scaling of the metric @xmath10 because the metric @xmath2 has no dynamics , we may solve its field equations and substitute the result back into the action without changing the equations of motion for the other fields .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath2 , @xmath11 and invariance under weyl scaling ( [ weyl ] ) allow us to set @xmath2 equal to the induced metric @xmath12 from which we see that ( [ action ] ) reduces to , and is therefore classically equivalent to , the standard square - root nambu - goto action .",
    "we will fix the coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 by choosing @xmath3 to be equal to coordinate time @xmath13 , and @xmath4 to run linearly along the length of the string and have a fixed interval @xmath14 regardless of the physical length of the string .",
    "this simplifies the description of the end - points of the string , but unfortunately precludes the use of orthonormal coordinates . a more detailed explanation of the nambu - goto - polyakov string , its geometrical aspects , and its relation to qcd strings can be found in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions we take on @xmath6 are that one end is fixed and the other is arbitrarily forced , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a prescribed function of time .",
    "this simplifies our presentation because we are only examining the piece of string from the center of mass to one of the quarks .",
    "it is a trivial generalization to include quarks at both ends . to include the dynamics of a ( spinless ) quark on the end of the string",
    ", we would use its equation of motion , @xmath17 which is essentially newton s second law with the tension in the string providing the force .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ quarkeom ] ) arises from the variation of the boundary of the string when quarks are included from the beginning .",
    "our purpose here is not to solve for the actual motion of the string ",
    "quark system , which is a difficult problem , but rather to find the shape of a string given a prescribed motion of its end .",
    "knowing the shape of the string , and using eq .",
    "( [ quarkeom ] ) , we are in principle able to find the motion of the string  quark system . in practice , we use the expressions for the total energy and angular momentum and quark momentum in terms of the quark velocity to find the spectrum for the quantized string  quark system numerically .",
    "we demonstrate in appendix  [ app : cons ] that eq .",
    "( [ quarkeom ] ) is equivalent to the conservation of energy , angular momentum and the quark mass - shell relation .",
    "planar motion is best described in terms of complex coordinates instead of vector notation . in complex coordinates , the string position @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 with @xmath20 the metric @xmath2 , from eq .",
    "( [ embmetric ] ) , is @xmath21 where we adopt the notation @xmath22 .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider here the fixed end at @xmath23 and the moving end at @xmath24 .",

    "this is the solution that we will perturb to find the string shape when its end undergoes angular acceleration .",
    "our ansatz is @xmath27 from eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , we find the metric tensor @xmath28 where we define @xmath29 substituting the above into the string equations ( [ eom ] ) , we find that they are exactly satisfied .",
    "this result is the realization of catalan s theorem mentioned earlier , where the straight line to the quark sweeps out a helicoid of fixed pitch but arbitrarily varying radius .",
    "again we emphasize that this is a solution of the string equations ( [ eom ] ) only . in a realistic meson , for which eq .",
    "( [ quarkeom ] ) also holds for the quarks on the ends , we must perturb eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) to find a solution that takes into account the necessary angular acceleration of the ends .    for future reference",

    "if we define the moment of inertia of a uniform string of `` mass '' @xmath36 rotating about one end as @xmath37 then the low velocity limits of @xmath30 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are @xmath40 as one might expect , the string can be thought of as a rod of mass @xmath36 .",
    "in the above we have demonstrated that a uniformly rotating string can remain straight even if the length changes .",
    "when the end has angular acceleration the string must curve . to gain intuition we consider a quasi - newtonian string of `` mass '' density @xmath0 which rotates with instantaneous angular velocity @xmath41 about one end . in the rotating frame",
    "an element at distance @xmath42 is assumed to be in equilibrium under two forces , the tension force @xmath43 and the angular acceleration fictitious force @xmath44 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "the only other possible transverse force is the coriolis force due to the radial motion of the right end .",
    "however , the element does not experience a coriolis force since motion of the end only creates more string and the notion of longitudinal velocity has no meaning .",
    "this type of motion can be thought of as `` adiabatic '' since the resulting shape depends only on the end acceleration .",
    "the force equilibrium condition yields @xmath45 in terms of dimensionless variables , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the above equation is @xmath48 using the end condition @xmath49 , we find the non - relativistic string shape @xmath50 which is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : one ] .",
    "in order to find the relativistic string shape , in this section we consider the nature of small string deflections .",

    "we find that the displacement from the straight string satisfies @xmath64    for small rotational velocities @xmath65 , the string shape equation ( [ stringshape ] ) reduces to @xmath66 which is identical to the non - relativistic result , eq .",

    "these results indicate that the actual size of the displacement from the straight string in real mesons is smaller than @xmath87 , which illustrates the validity of the straight string approximation .",
    "note that numerical estimates shown in those figures were obtained using only the confining part of the heavy - light rft model with string tension @xmath88 .",
    "addition of the short - range one gluon exchange interaction would further reduce our results .",
    "we now compute the effects of the deformation away from straightness on string dynamics . to this end",
    "we compare the angular momentum , energy , and linear momentum of the actual string with that of the straight string .",
    "the similarities and differences are quite interesting .",
    "we proceed in each case by substituting the perturbed string form ( [ perturbx ] ) and the consequent perturbed metric into the desired dynamical quantities .      the expression ( [ j ] ) for the angular momentum to first order in small quantities becomes @xmath89 where we refer to eq .",
    "( [ jstraight ] ) for the straight string result . to compare with the straight string angular momentum we must have strings of the same length and with the same end velocity which requires that both @xmath90 and @xmath91 vanish .",
