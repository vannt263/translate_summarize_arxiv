    "filamentous networks @xcite are an important class of materials in which the interplay between stretching and bending energies and temperature lead to unique mechanical properties such as strong nonlinear response and strain stiffening @xcite , negative normal stress @xcite , non - affine response @xcite , crossover from non - affine to affine response @xcite , and power - law frequency dependence of the storage and loss moduli @xcite .",
    "they are a part of such important components of living matter @xcite as the cytoskeleton , the intercellular matrix , and clotted blood and of industrial materials like paper @xcite . here",
    "we introduce the diluted kagome lattice , shown in fig .",

    "effective medium theories ( emts ) @xcite have proven to be a powerful tool for the study of random systems .",
    "we use recently derived emts @xcite that treat bending as well as stretching forces in elastic networks to calculate the shear modulus @xmath5 as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and derive scaling forms for its behavior near @xmath4 and near the @xmath13 rigidity threshold at @xmath10 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath5 using numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations and emts are in qualitative agreement over the entire range of @xmath3 and in quantitative agreement near @xmath4 .",
    "our results are also in general agreement with those for the mikado model @xcite , including , in particular , a crossover from bending - dominated nonaffine response at low density ( small @xmath3 ) to stretching dominated affine response at high density ( @xmath3 near @xmath14 )",
    ". our model , however , highlights special properties of networks of straight filaments , including scaling collapse , described analytically by our emts , of the region near @xmath4 where filament length @xmath15 approaches infinity , and the underlying origins of affine response in this limit .     and @xmath16 horizontal bonds and @xmath17 bonds along the axis at an angle @xmath18 to the @xmath19-axis .",
    "the red sites on the lattice are crosslinks , and colinear sequences of bonds are filaments .",
    "only two filaments , shown with thicker bonds , traverse the lattice from top to bottom and support external stresses .",
    "one these makes an angle @xmath20 and one an angle @xmath21 with the @xmath19-axis , and the length of both is @xmath22 . in more general lattices ,",
    "sample crossing filaments can orient at any angle @xmath23 to the @xmath19-axis , but the projection of their length onto the vertical axis is @xmath24 , and thus their length is @xmath25 . ]    the building blocks of filamentous networks are typically semi - flexible polymers , characterized by a bending modulus @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the persistence length @xmath28 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath29 the temperature . where filaments intersect , physical or chemical crosslinks bind them together but do not inhibit their relative rotation .",
    "since only two filaments cross at a point , each crosslink is connected to at most four others .",
    "the average distance @xmath30 between crosslinks is less that @xmath27 . a remarkably faithful description of experimentally measured linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite elastic response is provided by a model in which elastic response is assumed to be affine and in which filamentous sections between crosslinks are treated as nonlinear central - force springs with a force - extension curve determined by the worm - like chain model @xcite augmented by an enthalpic stretching energy .",
    "this simple model , however , misses some important properties of filamentous networks , including the existence of a rigidity percolation threshold @xcite , nonaffine response @xcite , and crossover from bending - dominated nonaffine response at small @xmath31 @xcite , or low frequency @xcite , to almost affine , stretching dominated response at large @xmath31 or high frequency .",
    "the mikado model @xcite provides additional insights into the physics of filamentous networks . in this model ,",
    "straight filaments of length @xmath15 are deposited with random position and orientation on a two - dimensional flat surface and crosslinked at their points of intersection .",
    "filaments are treated as elastic rods with one - dimensional stretching and bending moduli , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , rather than as worm - like chains .",
    "numerical simulations on this model reveal a rigidity percolation transition from a floppy network to one with non - vanishing shear and bulk moduli and with non - affine bending dominated elastic response . as @xmath31",
    "is increased , response becomes more affine and stretching dominated , reaching almost perfectly affine response in the @xmath32 limit .",
    "our emts and numerical simulations yield similar results for the diluted kagome model .",
    "though the mikado and the diluted kagome lattice are quite similar with crosslinks of maximum coordination four and variable values of the ratio @xmath31 , they model slightly different parts of the phase space of possible two - dimensional filamentous networks . in particular , since the starting point of the diluted kagome lattice is the full lattice with all bonds occupied , it necessarily deals directly with the @xmath33 limit , which is not generally accessed in studies of the mikado model in which @xmath15 is restricted to be less than the sample width @xmath34 .",
    "the mikado model is an  off - lattice \" model , whereas the kagome model is lattice based .",
    "the latter property of the kagome model facilitates the application of lattice - based emts @xcite ( modified to include bending ) for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , in the mikado model , the distance between between crosslinks on a single filament follows a poisson distribution with no lower bound , whereas in the kagome lattice , this distance is an integral multiple of the lattice spacing with a lower bound of one lattice spacing .",
    "this difference leads , as we shall see , to a different scaling of the shear modulus in the bending dominated regime near @xmath4 .    as detailed in apps .",
    "[ app : asym ] and [ sec : appc ] , our emts clearly show that there are three critical points ( or fixed points in the renormalization - group sense ) : the trivial empty lattice point at @xmath35 ( which we ignore ) , the rigidity - percolation point at @xmath10 , and the @xmath4 full lattice point .",
    "it also provides analytic scaling relations for the the shear modulus @xmath5 as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in the @xmath36 limit near both @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "of particular interest is the behavior near @xmath4 , where the ratio @xmath37 of the shear modulus to its @xmath4 value @xmath38 can be expressed as a function of the single scaling variable @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the bending length @xmath41 is the average filament length and @xmath42 is the average spacing between crosslinks along a filament . as @xmath43 , @xmath5 approaches @xmath38 , but as @xmath44 , there is crossover to a bending dominated , nonaffine regime in which @xmath45 this behavior , which appears in our simulations , has also been observed in simulations in diluted three - dimensional lattices of four - fold coordinated filaments @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we speculate about the reasons for the same behavior appearing in both two- and three - dimensions .",
    "@xcite developed an off - lattice emt for filamentous networks that predicts a bending - dominated non - affine regime with a different power of @xmath31 , @xmath46 , than the one we predict .",
    "the origin of this different scaling is the absence of a lower cutoff in the poisson distribution of the distance between crosslinks in the mikado model compared to the fixed cutoff equal to the lattice spacing in the kagome model .",
    "the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite yields the kagome lattice scaling law if the probability distribution for distances is replaced by one with a fixed lower cutoff .     and the stretching dominated region in which @xmath47 .",
    "this boundary between stretching- and bending - dominated response was calculated using a formula that interpolates between the analytic emt expressions for @xmath5 near @xmath10 and near @xmath4 . ]",
    "our numerical simulations follow the emt prediction very closely with _ no _ adjustable parameters near @xmath4 if @xmath2 is not too large . for really small values of @xmath48 ,",
    "finite - size effects become important , and simulations can be fit with a combination of the exactly calculable finite size results at @xmath49 and the emt scaling form valid at infinite @xmath34 . near @xmath10 , simulations are consistent with a scaling function of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling-2 ] ) but with @xmath50 approximately @xmath51 rather than @xmath14 and with different values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    under periodic boundary conditions , the kagome lattice has exactly @xmath54 neighbors per site , where @xmath55 is the spatial dimension .",
    "if sites interact only via central - force springs on bonds and not by bending forces along filaments , the lattice is _ isostatic _ in that it has exactly enough internal forces to eliminate zero modes according the simple maxwell count @xcite : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number of zero modes and @xmath58 is the number of bonds . under",
    "free rather than periodic boundary conditions , sites on the boundaries have fewer than four neighbors , and there is an overall bond deficiency of @xmath59 . as a result , there are of order @xmath60 zero  floppy \" internal modes of zero energy in the absence of bending forces . under periodic boundary conditions",
    ", the simple maxwell count leads to @xmath61 , but the total number of zero modes ( as calculated by the dynamical matrix , whose normal modes are the  infinitesimal \" modes that result when the elastic energy is truncated to harmonic order ) , like the number under free boundary conditions , is of order @xmath60 rather than zero @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is a result of the existence of lattice configurations that can support stress in bonds while maintaining a zero force at each note @xcite .",
    "associated with each such configuration @xcite , called a  _ state of self stress _ \" , is an additional infinitesimal zero mode so that the maxwell count becomes @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of states of self stress .",
    "thus , in the undiluted central - force kagome lattice under periodic boundary conditions , @xmath64 is simply the number of states of self - stress .",
    "these states endow the undiluted central - force kagome lattice with affine response and non - zero bulk and shear moduli , proportional to the bond spring constant , and , thus , determine the approach to affine , stretching - dominated response as @xmath11 in the diluted lattice with nonzero @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the central - force zero modes associated with the states of self stress also control the form of the effective - medium equations and the scaling forms they predict .",
    "the addition of bending forces lifts all but the two trivial zero modes of rigid translation to finite frequency .",
    "this fact plays a central roll in our emt and is ultimately responsible for the form of the scaling function for @xmath5 near @xmath4 .",
    "we are ultimately interested in three - dimensional filamentous networks , which are subisostatic with @xmath65 because their maximum coordination number , like the that of two - dimensional networks , is four .",
    "if constituent filaments are straight , these networks have a state of self - stress for each filament in the undiluted limit , and their elastic moduli are non - zero , proportional to the bond - spring constant , and independent of @xmath2 @xcite . associated with each state of self - stress , there is an additional zero mode , but as in the kagome lattice , the addition of bending forces raises all but the three trivial zero modes of uniform translation to finite frequency and stabilizes the lattice .",
    "we will argue in sec .",

    "this leads to affine response in linear elasticity for any lattice in any dimension consisting of sample - traversing straight filaments with a sufficient number of orientations to ensure stability with respect to all strain @xcite . to see this , consider a crosslink ( node of the lattice ) at the origin on a filament parallel to the unit vector @xmath74 , and let it be connected to two other crosslinks on the same filament at respective positions @xmath75 and @xmath76 relative to the orign . under a uniform , affine deformation , the relative positions @xmath77 , @xmath78 transform to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the deformation tensor with components @xmath81 .",

    "when the lattice is diluted , not every crosslink is connected to two others , the above cancelation does not occur , and the result is nonaffine response with a bending component .    with these observations , we can calculate the shear modulus of any network of straight filaments with stretching energy only , i.e. , @xmath6 . for simplicity ,",

    "this work has also largely focused on what are really mechanical models with beam energies assigned to the filaments and the effects of thermal fluctuations ignored .",

    "filaments in real biological gels are not straight , and their energies are not described by that of an elastic beam .",
    "it is thus legitimate to ask how seriously one should take models such as those presented here as realistic descriptions of real bio - gels of semiflexible polymers . if constituent filaments are not straight , then in general , at least some of elastic moduli of even perfect lattices vanish in the absence of bending forces .",
    "prime examples of this behavior are found in the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice and the three - dimensional diamond lattice whose bulk moduli are nonzero but whose shear moduli vanish in the @xmath305 limit , but it has also been observed in a more realistic model of a filamentous lattice @xcite . if @xmath2 is needed to stabilize the system , the elastic response to external stresses will involve bending and thus be nonaffine .",
