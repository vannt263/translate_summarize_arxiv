    "potential precursors of early b to possibly late o stars with @xmath2m@xmath0 have been frequently revealed ( e.g.bontemps _ et al . _",

    "the larger effective jeans masses of these protostars can be explained by a combination of turbulence and magnetic fields at small scale ( mckee & tan @xcite ) , or by collapse from larger scales at which jeans masses are larger due to lower average densities ( e.g.hennebelle & chabrier @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical models reproduce up to 10m@xmath0 fragments from a 100m@xmath0 collapsing core ( commeron _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , further suggesting that the combined effect of magnetic fields and radiative feedback determines the early fragmentation of massive cores ( see also krumholz _ et al . _",

    "compact sources have been identified ( csengeri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and we have made substantial progress in characterising various evolutionary stages of massive clumps by using ancillary radio and mid - infrared data ( e.g.urquhart _ et al . _ @xcite ) , and assigned distances to a large number of sources ( wienen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . given its higher angular resolution ( 192 ) compared to _",
    "herschel _ at submillimeter wavelengths , the atlasgal survey is better suited to disentangle the more evolved from the pristine cold sources .",
    "selected from atlasgal , we identified a complete sample of 45 objects which are massive ( @xmath3650m@xmath0 ) and dense , with surface density exceeding the theoretical 1g@xmath4 threshold ( krumholz _ et al . _",

    "in addition they lack bright mid - infrared embedded objects , suggesting that they are in their earliest evolutionary phase .",
    "our selection of these mid - infrared quiet massive clumps is complete within 4.5 kpc , and to date represents the best potential sites to host the next generation of the most massive stars currently forming in our galaxy .",
    "we used alma to perform the first systematic survey at high angular - resolution to look for high - mass protostars in this sample of massive clumps . as a first step we present here the results of the atacama compact array ( aca ) observations , which provides a 35  angular resolution corresponding to @xmath50.050.1 pc physical scales ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this size - scale shows the fragmentation from clump to core scales , and reveals a sample of mdcs .",
    "the first result of this survey is to confirm the presence of compact embedded sources towards our selection of mid - infrared quiet atlasgal clumps .",
    "only one source out of the entire survey is found to be resolved out lacking embedded compact objects , while the rest all shows at least one centrally concentrated fragment .",
    "interestingly , the sample shows limited fragmentation , with only 23 mdcs revealed per clump , which is similar to earlier findings by motte _",
