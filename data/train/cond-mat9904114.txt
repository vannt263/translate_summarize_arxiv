    "solutions containing macromolecules are ubiquitous in the everyday life . from food colloids to the dna , we are surrounded by these giant molecules which directly or indirectly govern every aspect of our lives . in many cases the macromolecules in solution posses a net charge .",
    "the electrostatic repulsion between the polyions is , often , essential to stabilization of colloidal suspensions . in the biological realm",
    "the electrostatics is responsible for the condensation of the dna and formation of actin bundles , while various physiological mechanisms depend on the electrostatic interactions between the proteins and the microions . in spite of their ubiquity ,",
    "our understanding of polyelectrolyte solutions is far from complete .",
    "the effort to fathom the role of electrostatics as it applies to the colloidal suspensions goes back over half a century to the classic works of derjaguin and landau  @xcite and of verwey and overbeek ( dlvo).@xcite these in turn were based on the pioneering studies of gouy  @xcite and chapman  @xcite of double layers in metal electrodes . following these early contributions ,",
    "a large effort has been devoted to solve the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation in various geometries .",
    "the mean - field treatment , based on the solution of the pb equation , suggests that the interaction between two equally charged macroions in a suspension containing counterions is always repulsive.@xcite in recent years , however , this dogma began to be questioned based on simulations,@xcite analytical calculations  @xcite and experiments,@xcite which indicated that for small distances and large charge densities , two like - charged polyions might actually attract !",
    "the fundamental goal of this paper is to demonstrate that this attraction is linked to the correlations between the microions omitted in the mean - field theories , and to establish the conditions under which the attraction becomes possible .",
    "we shall consider the interaction between two infinite uniformly charged plates confining their own point - like counterions .",
    "the mean - field approximation for this system is obtained by solving the pb equation which , due to the planar symmetry , can be done analytically . once the density profile is obtained ,",
    "all the other thermodynamic quantities can be easily derived .",
    "thus , it is not difficult to demonstrate that the pressure at the mean - field level , in units of energy , is simply the density of counterions at the mid - plane between the plates .",
    "since this is always positive , no attraction is possible within the mean - field theory .",
    "realization that the correlations between the counterions can strongly modify the mean - field predictions goes back a number of years .",
    "one of the first approaches proposed by kjellander and marelja  @xcite was to include the correlations through the numerical solution of the anisotropic hypernetted chain equation ( ahnc ) .",
    "these authors found that the force per unit area ( pressure ) can become negative in the presence of divalent counterions .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations performed by guldbrand _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also indicate that as the surface charge density is increased , the pressure decreases if the distance between the charged surfaces is sufficiently small . as in the case of the ahnc calculations ,",
    "attraction was found only in the presence of divalent counterions .",
    "these authors , however , did not analyze the case of very high charge density and short distance between the plates .",
    "in addition , since in the above calculations it is difficult to separate the different physical contributions to the pressure , the mechanism that drives the attraction remains unclear .",
    "a different theoretical approach which attempted to shed some light on the mechanism of attraction was advanced by stevens and robbins.@xcite these authors proposed a density - functional theory similar to the one often employed in studies of simple liquids .",
    "this approach introduces a grand - potential free energy , @xmath0 $ ] , which is a functional of the non - uniform density of counterions @xmath1 .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the system are obtained through the minimization of the total free energy .",
    "the practical problem with this method is that the exact form of the functional is not known .",
    "when the correlations between the microions are omitted , the minimization of the grand potential , @xmath2 , becomes trivial and leads to the usual pb equation.@xcite in order to account for the correlations between the counterions , stevens and robbins  @xcite appealed to the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite within this approach an additional contribution , @xmath3 , is added to the mean - field expression , @xmath2 .",
    "the expression for @xmath3 adopted by stevens and robbins was obtained through the extrapolation of the mc data for the _ homogeneous _ one - component plasma ( ocp),@xcite but with the homogeneous density replaced by an _",
    "inhomogeneous _ density profile .",
    "the minimization of the free - energy functional allowed them to determine the density profile , @xmath1 , and the pressure , @xmath4 .",
    "the lda , however , is not without its own problems .",
    "the major drawback of this approach is that , for short distances and high charge densities , the lda is unstable .",
    "the reason for the instability is due to the fact that as the density of counterions in the vicinity of the plates increases , the chemical potential decreases , what attracts more particles to the region .",
    "this , in turn , leads to an unphysical `` chain reaction '' where all the counterions condense onto the plates .",
    "clearly , when the distance between the counterions becomes smaller than some threshold value , @xmath5 , the lda ceases to be a reliable approximation.@xcite    an improvement over the lda is , the so called , weighted density approximation ( wda).@xcite in this case , the excess free energy is taken to be a function of an _ average _ density , @xmath6 , averaged over a region of radius @xmath7 , where the interactions between the counterions are the strongest.@xcite the difficulty in the practical implementation of this scheme is the determination of a proper weight function . the simplest possible form for @xmath8 , used by stevens and robbins,@xcite was to assume that this function has a long - range variation comparable to the wall separation.@xcite in this case , the weighted density @xmath9 is approximated by the homogeneous density independent of @xmath10 .",
    "however , when the walls are not close , @xmath11 , the weighted function is no longer uniform and the approximation adopted by stevens and robbins becomes unrealistic .",
    "a beautiful explanation of the attraction between like - charged plates has been recently advanced by rouzina and bloomfield.@xcite these authors present a picture of attraction as arising from the ground - state configuration of the counterions . clearly at zero temperature",
    "the counterions will recondense onto the surface of the plates forming two intercalating wigner crystals .",
    "the authors advance a hypothesis that even at finite temperatures , relevant to the common experimental conditions , the attraction is still governed by the zero - temperature correlations .",
    "a somewhat different formulations based on field - theoretic methodology have also been proposed . in these approximations",
    "the attraction arises as a result of correlated fluctuations in the counterion charge densities.@xcite although providing a nice qualitative explanation of the origin of the attraction , these simple theories fail to yield a quantitative agreement with the simulations .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different form of the weighted - density approach , which rectifies the problems of the earlier theories while still remaining numerically tractable .",
    "the excess free energy and the weight function , @xmath8 , are derived from the debye - hckel - hole ( dhh ) theory of the ocp.@xcite the density profile is determined by minimizing the free - energy density with respect to the _ local _ density .",
    "once the density profile is obtained , the free energy of the system is calculated by inserting it into the expression for the free - energy functional .",
    "given the free energy , all the thermodynamic properties of the system can be easily calculated . a careful analysis of the behavior of the pressure as a function of the charge density and the distance between the plates allows us to explore the nature and the origin of the attraction .",
