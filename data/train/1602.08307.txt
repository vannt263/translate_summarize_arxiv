    "maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) is a standard approach to parameter estimation and inference , and a fundamental computational task in statistics .",
    "it consists of the following problem : given the observed data and a model of interest , find the probability distribution that is most likely to have produced the data . in the past decade ,",
    "algebraic techniques for the computation of maximum likelihood estimates have been developed with some success for algebraic statistical models for discrete data ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this article is concerned with the problem of maximum likelihood estimation for algebraic statistical models with singularities , in particular those which correspond to toric del pezzo surfaces with du val singular points .",
    "the importance of algebraic statistical models corresponding to toric varieties is due to their relation to log - linear statistical models which are widely used in statistics ( @xcite ) .",
    "another reason for studying the mle for such algebraic statistical models , is that they correspond to singular varieties .",
    "singularities play an important role in statistical inference as the commonly assumed smoothness of algebraic statistical models is very restrictive and is almost never satisfied for models of statistical relevance ( see [ @xcite , p. 100",
    "] , @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant definitions to this problem are given bellow .",
    "consider the complex projective space @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath1 . in our setting the coordinate",
    "@xmath2 represents the probability of the @xmath3-event therefore @xmath4 .",
    "the set of points in @xmath0 with positive real coefficients is identified with the probability simplex @xmath5 an algebraic statistical model is a closed subset @xmath6 of the complex projective space @xmath0 , with the model itself being the intersection of @xmath6 with the probability simplex @xmath7 .",
    "the data is given by a non - negative integer vector @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of times the @xmath3-event is observed .",
    "the maximul likelihood estimation problem consists of finding a model point @xmath10 which maximises the likelihood of observing the data .",
    "this amounts to maximising the corresponding likelihood function @xmath11 over the model @xmath6 , where here we ignore a multinomial coefficient .",
    "statistical computations are usually implemented in the affine @xmath12-plane @xmath4 .",
    "however , including the denominator makes the likelihood function a well - defined rational function on the projective space @xmath0 , enabling one to use projective algebraic geometry to study its restriction to the variety @xmath6 .",
    "the likelihood function might not be convex , so it can have many local maxima and the problem of finding and certifying a global maximum is difficult .",
    "therefore , in most recent works the problem of finding all critical points of the likelihood function is considered , with the aim of identifying all local maxima ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to solving a system of polynomial equations and these equations , defining the critical points of the likelihood function l , are called likelihood equations .",
    "the number of complex solutions to the likelihood equations equals the number of complex critical points of the restriction of the likelihood function l to the model m , which is called the maximum likelihood ( ml ) degree of the variety m.      in this article we are studying the maximum likelihood estimation problem for toric models which are models with a well behaved likelihood function .",
    "toric models are known as log - linear models in statistics , because the logarithms of the probabilities are linear functions in the logarithms of the parameters @xmath13 .",
    "they have the property that maximum likelihood estimation is a convex optimization problem . assuming that the parameter domain @xmath14 is bounded",
    ", it follows that the likelihood function has exactly one local maximum .",
    "we introduce toric models following the notation used in chapter 1.2 of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a non - negative integer @xmath16 matrix with the property that all column sums are equal : @xmath17 the @xmath18-th column vector @xmath19 of the matrix @xmath20 represents the monomial @xmath21 and the assumption that the column sums of the matrix @xmath20 are all equal means these monomials all have the same degree .",
    "the toric model of @xmath20 is the image of the orthant @xmath22 under the map @xmath23    maximum likelihood estimation for the toric model means solving the optimization problem of maximising the function @xmath24 subject to the constrains @xmath25 .",
    "this is equivallent to maximising function @xmath26 where @xmath27",
    "let @xmath28 denote the sufficient statistic , then the optimisation problem above becomes @xmath29    fix a toric model @xmath20 and data @xmath30 with sample size @xmath31 and sufficient statistic @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be any local maximum for the equivalent optimization problems above .",
    "then @xmath34    given a matrix @xmath35 and any vector @xmath36 , we consider the set @xmath37 this is a relatively open polytope and birch s theorem below asserts that it is either empty or meets the toric model in precisely one point .",
    "fix a toric model @xmath20 and let @xmath38 be a strictly positive data vector with sufficient statistic @xmath39 .",
    "the intersection of the polytope @xmath40 with the toric model @xmath25 consists of precisely one point .",
    "that point is the maximum likelihood estimate @xmath41 for the data @xmath42 .",
    "in the next section we will determine a closed form for the maximum likelihood estimates for all algebraic statistical models corresponding to toric del pezzo surfaces of degree three and four with du val singularities .",
    "the corresponing polytope of a toric del pezzo surface with du val singularities is a reflexive polytope . according to the classification results of reflexive polytopes ( see @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", there are 16 isomorphism classes of such two - dimensional reflexive polytopes , a list of which we provide bellow .",
