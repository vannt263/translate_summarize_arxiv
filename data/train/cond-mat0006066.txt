    "in the last decade the clustering instability of undriven granular gases was extensively researched . since the first explanation of the instability @xcite investigation had been done with several methods including stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite and fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the examination of the influence of nonlinear coupling between hydrodynamic modes was also performed @xcite , and the long time behavior of the clustered state was with mode - coupling theories examined @xcite .",
    "the evolution of vortex velocity patterns preceding the clustering instability is well understood @xcite , and the minimal system size , where the instability appears , and its dependence on the restitution coefficient are revealed @xcite .    a driven configuration , the uniformly sheared inelastic hard sphere gas ( with periodic boundary conditions ) shows also an instability and a resulting pattern formation . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this pattern formation was guided by an instability for the short times and a shearing caused convection for longer time - scales .",
    "the special importance of this system is the coupling of macroscopic and microscopic length - scales in sheared situations as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a more realistic configuration is the couette - flow , the shearing of the gas between two parallel walls moved in opposite directions . for this configuration with walls consisting of disks jenkins and",
    "richman derived boundary conditions for the momentum and heat transfer of the walls @xcite proceeding from their kinetic theory for dense granular gases @xcite . in subsequent years",
    "this theory was developed further @xcite for non maxwellian velocity distributions as in @xcite . in all of these papers",
    "the resulting hydrodynamic fields are symmetric ( density and granular temperature ) or antisymmetric ( flow field ) on the half - point between the two bounding walls . in view of the clustering instability it is of major interest",
    "whether this instability occurs in this configuration and , if so , what are its consequences in the couette - flow .",
    "this paper is devoted to the investigation of these questions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section ( [ simul ] ) we present molecular dynamic simulations of this system where we found an interesting sensitivity to the initial condition of the simulation and asymmetric hydrodynamic fields contradicting the results in @xcite .",
    "therefore we carried out the linear stability analysis ( sec .",
    "[ jrstab ] ) around the solution of jenkins and richman @xcite and found it to be unstable against certain fluctuations .",
    "we discuss the effect of this instability on the diffusion coefficient in sec .",
    "[ diffcoeff ] and close the paper with summary in sec .",
    "[ disco ] .",
    "the system considered here consisted of @xmath0 identical , inelastic hard disks with mass @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 confined in a rectangular area of the size @xmath3 .",
    "this two - dimensional area is bounded by two parallel walls from two sides which also define the direction @xmath4 and are of the length @xmath5 .",
    "the system is closed through periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the walls are @xmath6 distance apart ( @xmath7 direction ) .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is placed in the middle of the simulated system what sets the center of the wall disks to @xmath8 .",
    "the disks interact through the inelastic rough hard sphere potential meaning instantaneous two particle collisions characterized by given ratios of the final and initial velocities in the normal and tangential direction as the normal and tangential restitution coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 meaning the final and initial velocities . in case of sliding contacts @xmath13 is replaced by the ratio of tangential and normal momentum transfer characterized by the friction coefficient @xmath14 . as a driving force we move one of the walls with constant velocity @xmath15 .",
    "we investigated the system with the event - driven molecular dynamics method ideal for simulating instantaneous collision rules @xcite . characterizing the collisions we used @xmath16 and @xmath17 and varied @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we consider the system sized @xmath21 and the wall velocity @xmath22 if not otherwise mentioned .",
    "the post - collision velocities and angular velocities as a function of the pre - collision ones are ( for @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , @xmath23 @xmath24 being the normal vector of disk surfaces in collision @xmath25 in anti - clockwise direction .",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 are the moments of inertia of the disks .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 depends on the type of the collision in tangential direction , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the tangential velocity @xmath31 and @xmath32 separates the sliding and sticking regions in the angle of incidence @xmath33 , @xmath34    to avoid inelastic collapse @xcite , the intrinsic numerical breakdown of the method , we stopped the simulations when the time interval between two subsequent collisions became smaller than the precision of the computations as proposed in @xcite ; but this stop occurred only for the used smallest restitution coefficient @xmath35 and for special initial conditions where most of the particles did not move , and the well - known chain - like arrangement of particles could evolve after the simulation started . for the experiments below we used particle numbers",
    "@xmath36 meaning area fraction @xmath37 $ ] . as",
    "test runs for larger systems we used \\{@xmath38 } and \\{@xmath39 } parameter sets resulting in the same phenomenon .    using several different starting configurations we noticed that there appears a dense region at one of the walls in the system which is more and more distinct with decreasing @xmath18 and not recognizable for @xmath18 near @xmath40 , fig 1 . using randomly placed particles and an initial uniform velocity distribution with several mean values in the @xmath4 direction we observed that the initial value of the mean particle velocity determines the wall which is chosen for building up a clustered regime .",
    "if we define @xmath41 as @xmath42 we can characterize the final place as if @xmath43 the upper @xmath44 wall is chosen , if @xmath45 the lower @xmath46 one , fig 2 .",
    "we used different initial conditions to test this finding @xcite . with particles placed in a stripe in the middle of the system , organized on a lattice with initial velocity @xmath47 , and using two of them shot against the two wall with initial velocities which were galilei - symmetric with the situation of two walls moved with @xmath48",
    "we could maximize the time needed to develop the non - symmetric density field but it appeared also after this initial condition because numerical errors provide the needed fluctuations to drive the system in one of the steady states .",
    "we did simulations for smooth disks ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) as well and found the same effect .",
    "namely , if we chose @xmath18 to be small enough there is a distinct band of particles at one of the walls and for @xmath18 close to @xmath40 this band does not evolve",
    ". the normal restitution below which we can speak about an asymmetric phase depends on the density as for higher densities it appears at higher @xmath18 values on the same system size @xmath6 .",
    "it also depends on @xmath6 for fixed density as for larger @xmath6 the kinetic energy influx per particle decreases as it is proportionate with the length of the wall .",
    "the assumed critical restitution coefficient @xmath51 does not depend on the driving velocity as @xmath47 is the only parameter which includes dimensionality of time and changing @xmath47 is a rescaling of the time unit . for the investigation of intermediate @xmath18 values for which the dense stripe is not so definite we measured density and velocity profiles and the granular temperature in the system and found the same effect now in the asymmetric nature of this functions fig 3 .",
    "one can also observe that with decreasing restitution the minimum of the granular temperature moves to one of the walls .",
    "we found these results valid for a broad range of densities and for different system sizes .",
    "for low restitution there appeared a crystalline structure as compact layers near a wall .",
    "the fact that the simulations did not stop at such dense configuration implies that the disks moved around a fixed place and did not form a long enough connected line of particles in which inelastic collapse could occur @xcite .",
    "simulations with time step driven molecular dynamics using damped harmonic oscillator forces between the particles as a function of their overlap @xcite  for achieving velocity independent restitution  show the same clustering effect at the walls .",
    "this suggests that this effect is closely related to the dissipative collisions and does not require instantaneous collision rules .",
    "our above findings contradict the kinetic theoretical calculation of jenkins and richman @xcite and the improved versions of the problem @xcite inasmuch as the cited results are always ( anti)symmetrical profiles in the @xmath7 direction for the hydrodynamic fields of density , flow velocity and granular temperature .",
    "this contradiction raises the question of the stability of the ( anti)symmetric solution .",
    "moreover , it is plausible that in an elastic system the hydrodynamic profiles are symmetric , though this is not a steady state because of the ever rising temperature caused by viscous heating . therefore it is of interest to see weather a phase transition occurs in the system , specifically , weather there exists a critical @xmath18 value or the ( anti)symmetric solution becomes unstable at arbitrarily small inelasticity . because at high densities the instability in question arises at normal restitution closer to @xmath40 and kinetic theoretical calculations are more and more inadequate for increasing inelasticity it is reasonable to use kinetic theories for dense systems and we desist from the consideration of more sophisticated hydrodynamic equations for low density systems @xcite .",
    "another reason for taking theories for dense gases into consideration is that the underlying assumptions are more valid as the ratio of the simulated system size to the mean free path is much larger in a dense gas . for this reasons we performed a linear stability analysis of the jenkins - richman solution .",
    "we now first recite the equations of jenkins and richman @xcite and the boundary conditions and the solution of the problem @xcite .",
    "then we perform a linearization around this solution and calculate numerically the eigenvalues of the stability matrix .      in this section",
    "we briefly describe the jenkins and richman @xcite solution for a two - dimensional system of inelastic hard disks driven by two parallel bumpy walls . the hydrodynamic equations for the density @xmath52 , flow velocity @xmath53 and fluctuation energy @xmath54 for smooth disks without external forces are according to @xcite : @xmath55 here the dissipation rate @xmath56 and heat transport coefficient @xmath57 are of the form , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the enskog correction term accounting for excluded volume effects as a function of the packing fraction @xmath60 : @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the disk diameter .",
    "the constitutive relations for the energy flux @xmath63 and pressure tensor @xmath64 are , @xmath65 from the boundary geometry and the assumption of a maxwellian velocity distribution the momentum and fluctuation energy supplied by the wall in unit time and length are determinable @xcite .",
    "this needs an expansion in @xmath66 and assumptions on the dependence of given ratios of the hydrodynamic fields on @xmath67 ( see @xcite ) , what narrows the validity of the theory .",
    "the supplied momentum obtained that way is @xmath68 with @xmath69 and the supplied fluctuation energy is @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the normal and tangential vectors of the wall respectively and @xmath73 characterizes the bumpyness of the wall . for wall disks with the same disk diameter as of the gas particles it equals @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the distance separating the centers of two wall disks . for the wall geometry of our considered system @xmath76 and therefore @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in ( [ eq1],[eq2 ] )",
    "@xmath79 accounts for static correlation effects in collisions at the boundary and @xmath80 is the slip velocity , the difference between the velocity of the wall and the flow @xmath81 . from the equality of momentum and energy transfer of the wall for unit time and unit length",
    "the boundary conditions are : @xmath82 the solution can be calculated from these equations except one parameter  the value of solid fraction at the boundaries ( for fixed number of particles )  which must be iterated to get the given density in the system what we did numerically .",
    "thus the form of the hydrodynamic fields solving the boundary value problem is , with @xmath83 , @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath0 being the shear stress and pressure respectively and @xmath86 must be solved from @xcite , @xmath87 } { \\theta(\\theta/\\sin\\theta-\\cos\\theta ) } -1 \\right).\\ ] ] the density , calculated from @xmath88 must fulfill the condition that its integral on the whole system gives the prepared particle number . as mentioned , in that condition",
    "the only free parameter remains the density at the boundaries what must be calculated iteratively .      around the above solution of the boundary value problem we performed a linear stability analysis with the perturbed quantities , @xmath89 we split the velocity perturbation in the @xmath4 and @xmath7 direction and use plane waves for the perturbations , @xmath90 with this choice the resulting equations have the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the stability matrix with the elements given in appendix [ matrix ] .    with the help of maple v release 5 we analyzed the eigenvalues of the stability matrix @xmath93 for different densities , restitution coefficients , wave numbers and sites .",
    "on fig 4 - 7 we present results for some of the parameter sets which are representative for the different situations . with the choice of the negative sign in ( [ stab ] ) a negative eigenvalue means an unstable solution .",
    "all of the shown figures feature at least one eigenvalue which is negative in the small wave number region .",
    "this signalizes the unstable fluctuation .",
    "the upper zero point of this eigenvalue nears to the zero wave number as we increase the restitution coefficient and becomes smaller than @xmath94 , the smallest possible wave number in the system , at a certain value of @xmath18 what depends on the other parameters .",
    "however , this value is very close to @xmath40 what suggests that the symmetrical solution is always unstable linearly and nonlinear effects can move this transition point to higher inelasticities .",
    "we analyzed the most unstable direction of the solution also as we plotted the unstable eigenvalue for a given amplitude of the wave number and for the whole angle measured from the direction of the mean flow in anti - clockwise direction as seen in fig 8,9 .",
    "according to the figures the most unstable directions are close to the @xmath95 angles which are the same angles found to be the governing unstable directions in linear order for the pattern formation by tan and goldhirsch for the uniformly sheared granular gas @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the crossover to asymmetric stationary states of the system and try to show the effect of the instability discussed above on the transport coefficients .",
    "for this reason we measured the mean square displacement of the particles , @xmath96 and velocity correlation functions , @xmath97 in the system for stream - wise and perpendicular directions . in ( [ msqd ] ) and ( [ velcor ] ) the brackets @xmath98 mean space and ensemble averages over the whole system .",
    "@xmath99 was calculated from the measured average displacement of the particles averaged over several ( 50 - 100 ) runs and over particles .",
    "ensemble averages were carried out the following way .",
    "for every parameter set we let relax the system in its steady state .",
    "then measured granular temperature averaged over stripes of width @xmath100 generating the @xmath101 function . before every measurement we perturbed the velocities of every particle with a uniformly distributed velocity the support of the distribution being @xmath102 , where @xmath7 was the coordinate of the particle .",
    "after relaxation we carried out the measurement .",
    "the @xmath99 average velocity was evaluated from a linear fit on the averaged @xmath4 displacement of the particles being the steepness of @xmath4 as a function of time .    from the mean square displacement for long times",
    "we could evaluate the diffusion coefficient of the particles .",
    "we fitted a power law with two fit parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 on the mean square displacement restricted to long times .",
    "if the value of @xmath104 was up to errors ( @xmath106 ) near @xmath40 the system was assumed to be in a diffusive state . after that we took @xmath107 and fitted @xmath108 again for @xmath103 .",
    "the time the system evolves into this diffusive state depends on @xmath18 as suggested in @xcite for the homogeneous cooling state , and also depends on the steady state configuration which is also @xmath18 dependent .",
    "this has several reasons .",
    "first , to achieve this diffusive behavior in @xmath4 direction the particles have to experience the characteristics of the system  finiteness and inhomogeneity of the hydrodynamic profiles  therefore have to travel between the to walls several times .",
    "as @xmath18 decreases and a dense cluster evolves at one wall this recognition takes more and more time .",
    "also the form of the velocity correlation function shows increasing correlations with decreasing @xmath18 as expected .",
    "after a short ( @xmath109 ) fast decay @xmath110 shows an exponential decay up to times @xmath111 and changes to a slow decay for later times ( small @xmath18 ) or is relaxed ( large @xmath18 ) fig 10 .",
    "both the short - time correlations and the characteristic time of the exponential increases as we decrease @xmath18 , along with the earlier changeover to the slow decay if it is apparent .    the plot of the mean square displacement versus time diagram ( fig 11 ) shows a plateau value of the diffusion coefficient for larger values of @xmath18 . below",
    "@xmath112 @xmath103 increases fast with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "we suggest that this value marks the transition point where the particles begin to prefer one of the walls and the appearing dilute regions allow for a greater mobility for the particles . making use of the noticed exponential decay of the velocity autocorrelation @xmath110 we also estimated @xmath103 as the integral of a fitted exponential",
    ", @xmath113 knowing that it underestimates @xmath103 as @xmath114 is smaller than @xmath110 for very short and for long times , but it gives nearly the same result as the long time behavior of @xmath115 above the transition point and shows a smaller increase below it ( fig 11 ) .",
    "this breakup comes from the fact that under the transition point there appears a slow decay in the velocity correlation function after the exponential decay used to approximate it .",
    "the short - time exponential decay characterizes only the dilute part of the system .",
    "the slow decay thereafter comes from the averaged effects of the exigous diffusion in the dense region and from the influence of particles entrapped or emitted by the dense region from or to the dilute one . in absence of the asymmetric dense state above the transition point",
    "@xmath116 only the exponential relaxation appears .",
    "the buildup of correlations is also a cause for increasing times needed to reach the diffusive state thus increasing simulation time what restricted us to smaller system sizes for dense material as it did not allow fast computations .",
    "therefore the investigation of the size and density dependence of the transition point is left for later studies .",
    "the retrievable information from the mean square displacement in @xmath7 direction is bounded as the system itself namely it goes to a plateau value according to @xmath6 .",
    "this finiteness influences velocity correlations also .",
    "@xmath117 shows only short - time fast decaying correlations ( and there appear anti - correlations for small @xmath18 . ) with the methods discussed above we do not noticed any mark of the transition ( only a small sign as presented in @xcite for time - step driven simulations ) .    for more definite insights in the behavior of the system we carried out measurements specific to the configuration of the stationary states .",
    "we divided the system into stripes parallel to the walls and restricted the averages in ( [ velcor ] ) on particles starting from these stripes , @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes averaging over particles being in stripe @xmath12 at @xmath120 and the ensemble average described above .",
    "the velocity @xmath121 is the average velocity of particles starting from stripe @xmath12 at time @xmath122 .",
    "this velocity correlation function characterizes the stripe more and more as the difficulty to leave the stripe increases which is the case in the dense layer evolving at the wall .",
    "the fact that the velocity correlation function @xmath123 does not show a negative minimum at short times ( fig.10 )  which would be a sign of caging effects  suggests , that the particles essentially comoving with the wall move barely in the @xmath4 direction compared to one another . instead because of the sheared situation they are driven by diagonal collisions which dominate the motion and smooth out @xmath110 .",
    "there is a negative minimum in @xmath124 ( @xmath125 indexing the stripe nearest to the wall at the cluster ) but this includes the effect of the collisions with the wall particles which give a negative contribution as also seen on the velocity correlations in the stripe at the opposite wall .",
    "this appears also at restitution coefficients well above the transition .",
    "in this paper we considered a granular gas sheared by two bumpy walls . by means of molecular dynamics simulations we discovered that the system shows a spontaneous symmetry breaking as it evolves to a stationary state which is asymmetric in the hydrodynamic fields with respect to the centerline of the system .",
    "the location where this density maximum ( temperature minimum ) is shifted to from the symmetry axes is predetermined by the initial velocity distribution as the system chooses the wall according to this distribution as discussed in sec .",
    "[ simul ] . during the simulations , measuring the mean @xmath7 coordinate of the particles",
    ", we did not observe any switch between the possible two states where the asymmetry was explicit .",
    "we found in a linear stability analysis that the symmetrical solution proposed by jenkins and richman @xcite is unstable . in analyzing the solution @xcite",
    "one finds that the description of the asymmetric profiles would need higher order equations in @xmath67 as in @xcite .",
    "we do not consider this analysis as a strict result quantitatively . according to @xcite the equations of jenkins and",
    "richman are not suitable for linear stability analysis because they neglect the time dependence of the mean free path .",
    "but the equations with the corrected constitutive relations @xcite have the same dependence on the hydrodynamic field and differ in the @xmath18 dependence only .",
    "we assume that this correction terms can not stabilize the system but can at most increase the @xmath18 value under which the solution becomes unstable .",
    "we found a connection to the unstable directions observed in uniformly sheared granular gases @xcite .",
    "that suggests that not uniformly sheared systems possess the same instability but in the couette - case the pattern formation is repressed by the boundary conditions .",
    "however , the geometry of the boundary conditions ( walls ) plays a major role in stabilizing the flow fields leading to a stationary state . in the boundary conditions of jenkins and richman @xcite only static correlations",
    "are considered and dynamic correlations , the role of multiple and correlated re- collisions with the wall , are neglected .",
    "we measured the number of collision sequences which consist of collisions of a disk with two wall disks successively because such collisions provide disks leaving the wall in a steeper angle what can provide greater contribution to the pressure at lower granular temperature . in the asymmetric flow regime",
    "the number of such collisions is clearly higher at the preferred wall than at the other what supports our assumption .",
    "this is also implied by the fact , that in the final stationary state the minimum of the granular temperature is only at the wall for very high inelasticities or densities where we could observe closed layers of particles at the wall chosen . for moderate densities and restitution",
    "the temperature minimum remains in the bulk of the system , and the clustering process stops at a stable density profile .",
    "such effect was described for a constrained homogeneous system in @xcite .",
    "this boundary effects are one reason for the different results for the transition point obtained from the stability analysis or the measurement of the self - diffusion coefficient and velocity autocorrelation functions respectively . the found effect in the dependency of these functions on the normal restitution coefficient described in sec . [ diffcoeff ]",
    "is well described as a consequence of the transition .",
    "however , the system size used in the simulations is too small to compare the two results .",
    "we suggest that for larger systems where the jenkins - richman theory is more valid we would obtain larger values for the transition point but the involved measurements leave this for later studies . as a final note we would like to mention that in systems with elastic collisions with the wall disks the flow with the same parameters remains symmetric .",
    "the consequences of this paper are hard to verify in experiments because of the absence of gravity .",
    "however microgravity experiments for the same configuration are under way @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the two - dimensional case considered here would be realizable with disks on an air table as this would exclude gravity effects and would not interfere with the behavior of the disks in the crucial horizontal direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions could be achieved with two similar stadion - like chains of disks as performed in @xcite .",
