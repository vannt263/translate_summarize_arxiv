    "correlated electronic systems display some of the most fascinating phenomena in solid state physics .",
    "one of their typical characteristics is a strong sensitivity to small changes of external control parameters .",
    "hence , a precise understanding of the underlying physics and of the pivotal parameters controlling the observed phenomenology represents a crucial goal in contemporary condensed matter research , also in light of possible applications beyond the purely academic context .",
    "the intrinsic complexity of many - body physics prevents an exact ab - initio theoretical description of correlated materials .",
    "in fact , even one of the most basic models for electronic correlations , i.e. the hubbard model@xcite where only the local part of the coulomb interaction is retained , can not be exactly solved in the relevant cases of two or three dimensions . however , a great step forward in the theoretical analysis of electronic correlation in condensed matter was achieved in the last decades by means of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , and , for realistic material calculations , by its merger with ab - initio density functional approaches ( lda+dmft)@xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", dmft - based methods can be viewed as a quantum extension of the classical mean - field approaches .",
    "hence , the application of dmft implies neglecting all non - local spatial correlations albeit allowing for a very accurate ( and non - perturbative ) treatment of the most relevant part of the electronic correlations stemming from the ( single or multi - orbital ) hubbard interaction i.e. , their purely local part .",
    "the ability of dmft to capture these local quantum fluctuations is one of the keys behind its success in addressing many open questions in the physics of strongly correlated materials . among those , we recall the pioneering dmft description of the mott@xcite metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in v@xmath2o@xmath3@xcite , of the @xmath4 phase of pu@xcite , of the correlation effects@xcite in fe and ni , of the volume collapse in ce@xcite , of the unconventional pairing mechanism of superconductivity in fullerenes@xcite",
    "; most recently dmft has been also successfully applied to the analysis of the occurrence of kinks in the self - energy@xcite and in the specific heat@xcite of particular vanadates , such as srvo@xmath3 , and liv@xmath2o@xmath5 , as well as of the spectral and magnetic properties@xcite of fe - based superconductors .",
    "furthermore , it should also be recalled here , that dmft is a very flexible scheme , whose application is possible also beyond the standard case of bulk correlated systems .",
    "in fact , dmft - based methods have been recently used to study correlated nanoscopic@xcite and hetero - structures@xcite . for the latter case ,",
    "we want to focus here , in particular , on the theoretical predictions for the fermi - surface properties of layered ni - based heterostructures .",
    "the application of lda+dmft to this problem , and more specifically , to the case of a @xmath6 layered lanio@xmath3/laalo@xmath3 heterostructure has raised a considerable interest , as the dmft results of refs .",
    "clearly prospect the possibility to drive the fermi surface `` topology '' of these materials very close to the one of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "in fact , the electronic structure in the bulk nickelates , such as r@xmath7sr@xmath8nio@xmath5 , is typically characterized by _ two _ bands crossing the fermi level@xcite , which arise from the two @xmath9-orbitals of ni ( the `` planar '' @xmath10 and `` axial '' @xmath11-orbital ) . however , by growing heterostructures with planes of lanio@xmath3 intercalated with insulating planes of laalo@xmath3 and on substrates providing an epitaxial strain , such as srtio@xmath3 or prsco@xmath3 , the energetic configuration of the @xmath11 will be correspondingly disfavored@xcite , which corresponds to a ( by our definition positive ) crystal field splitting @xmath12 among the two ni @xmath13-orbitals . in this situation",
    ", lda+dmft calculations have shown that the inclusion of the correlation effects will always increase the original ( lda ) crystal field splitting between the two @xmath9-orbitals@xcite , leading , eventually , to a significant change of the `` topology '' of the fermi surface , i.e. to a situation in which only _ one _ band , with predominant @xmath14-character crosses the fermi level . hence , according to these lda+dmft calculations , in ni - based heterostructures it would be possible to `` artificially '' realize the electronic configuration of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates ( i.e. , single , almost half - filled orbital with @xmath14 symmetry close the fermi level ) , e.g. by modulating the strain through changing the substrate or the insulating layer . as the control of the low - fermi surface properties represents an essential ingredient for novel , alternative , realizations of high - temperature superconductivity , the importance of having highly accurate lda+dmft predictions becomes a crucial factor for engineering new materials .",
    "in contrast to these impressive applications of dmft - based methods , one important aspect should be stressed here : the lda+dmft procedure requires as an important step a downfolding to a chosen energy window around the fermi energy @xmath15 . for most of the above mentioned studies ,",
    "this window included only a few bands around @xmath15 of dominant 3d character .",
    "in such basis for the transition metal oxides the hybridization of 3d states and oxygen ligand 2p states is included _",
    "implicitely _ in the effective bands .",
    "in the recent past , however , it has become customary to include the oxygen 2p states _ explicitely _ ,",
    "i.e. to downfold to a larger energy window . in most of the cases ,",
    "these additional ( @xmath0- ) orbitals were way more extended than the correlated ones ( e.g. @xmath1 ) , and , hence , the local coulomb interaction between electrons occupying these additional orbitals ( @xmath16 ) and between electrons on different manifolds ( @xmath17 ) was either completely neglected , or , in some exceptional cases , treated at the hartree level@xcite . despite this approximation , it is quite intuitive to expect that the validity of lda+dmft calculations performed in an enlarged ( say : @xmath18 ) basis - set is more general than the corresponding one in the restricted @xmath1 manifold .",
    "in fact , quite generally : ( i ) performing a renormalization ( wannier@xcite projection , nmto@xcite downfolding , etc . ) on an enlarged basis - set allows for a better localization of the orbitals of the correlated manifold ( as the @xmath18-hopping processes are now explicitly included in the model ) ; and ( ii ) the possibility of describing explicitly charge - transfer processes between the @xmath1 and @xmath0-orbitals makes the theoretical modeling evidently closer to the actual material physics@xcite .",
    "notwithstanding these quite general arguments , the improvement of lda+dmft calculations on enlarged @xmath18 basis - sets w.r.t .",
    "the ones restricted to effective @xmath1-only basis , is not always apparent . in fact",
    ", there are cases for which a treatment on a larger basis set renders the comparison with experiment to be worse ! without attempting to give a complete review here , we recall that lda+dmft calculations including @xmath0-orbitals have improved the descriptions of the insulating behavior of nio@xcite and of the mit in nis@xmath2@xcite w.r.t .",
    "@xmath1-only calculations@xcite .",
    "also quite accurate results have been obtained for one- and two - particle properties of cobaltates ( such as srcoo@xmath3@xcite and lacoo@xmath3 @xcite ) and in several studies@xcite of the well - known class of iron - pnictides and calchogenides .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned successful applications of @xmath18 calculations , in other , equally important , cases the @xmath18 lda+dmft results are in partial or total contradiction with the @xmath1-only calculations , and/or with the experimental findings : no mit in v@xmath2o@xmath3 was found up to unrealistically large values of the coulomb interaction if the oxygen @xmath0-orbitals are included in lda+dmft calculations @xcite .",
    "more recently also the mott - hubbard insulating phase of la@xmath2cuo@xmath5 and lanio@xmath3 was reported to be missing in the @xmath18 framework@xcite , while these materials are found to be insulating in @xmath1-only calculations for plausible values of the @xmath19 interaction .",
    "these discrepancies between @xmath1-only and @xmath18 calculations regarding the mott - hubbard mit have already raised a discussion in the recent literature . in ref .",
    ", non - local correlations to be included beyond dmft@xcite have been considered as a cause of the discrepancy .",
    "in fact , a major role of spatial correlations in determining the onset of insulating phases is quite likely , especially in the case of two - dimensional cuprates .    however , there are also other discrepancies , whose discussion will be the object of the present work , which can be hardly attributed to the effects of non - local correlations .",
    "these discrepancies are observed for systems of more than one correlated @xmath1-orbital and in broad parameter regimes ( including high temperatures ) , where effects beyond dmft should not play a crucial role . in particular ,",
    "a striking disagreement between @xmath1-only and @xmath18 calculations was reported for the above - mentioned case of ni - based heterostructures .",
    "in fact , lda+dmft calculations performed including also the oxygen @xmath0-orbitals have shown@xcite exactly the opposite trend w.r.t .",
    "the previous ones : even in presence of a favorable crystal field splitting @xmath20 at the starting ( lda ) level , the net effect of the hubbard interaction was _ always _ to reduce the orbital polarization by filling back the @xmath11-orbital , which would prohibit _ de facto _ any possibility of realizing the cuprate conditions for the onset of an unconventional superconductivity .",
    "this second kind of discrepancies between lda+dmft performed with different ( @xmath1-only vs. @xmath18 ) basis - sets well illustrated by the contradicting results for the ni - based heterostructures , raises a quite general question about the proper use and interpretation of the growing number of lda+dmft calculations on extended basis sets .",
    "the correct determination of the orbital polarization and fermi surface properties is of great importance for future calculations of increasingly complex materials .",
    "in this paper we aim at understanding the relations between the results of existing lda+dmft calculations on different basis - sets for the fermi surface properties of multi - orbital systems and , ultimately , the origin of the qualitative discrepancies observed by following the standard implementation of the algorithms in different basis - sets . for this purpose , it is of primary importance to disentangle the main , qualitative , trends from the specific features of a selected case .",
    "hence , we will study model hamiltonians for different crsytal field splittings starting from a dp - basis ( 4 bands ) .",
    "subsequently , we perform a downfolding to an effective d - only basis and compare dmft ressults of both cases .",
    "this procedure will capture the above - mentioned discrepancy in the prediction of fermi surfaces of correlated multi - orbital systems and allow for a systematic study of this problem in the context of ni - based materials .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the models . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the disagreement in the calculation of the orbital occupations and the shape of the fermi surfaces between @xmath1-only and @xmath18 model for a fixed set of interaction parameters . at the end of sec .",
    "iii , we also provide an analysis of the role of hund s exchange @xmath21 . in sec .",
    "iv we study the origin of the observed inconsistencies by analyzing the dependence on the @xmath1-electron - density , and we discuss its possible relation with the crossover@xcite from high - spin ( hund s regime ) to low - spin ( cf regime ) .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the simplified model hamiltonians chosen to analyze the discrepancies between the existing lda+dmft calculations on different ( @xmath1-only vs. @xmath18 ) basis - sets for the prediction of the orbital polarization and the fermi surface properties of correlated multi - orbital systems .",
    "let us stress that , in this work , we aim at a basic understanding of the general physics underlying the contradicting outcomes of realistic calculations , rather than discussing the case of a specific material . as a guidance for the choice of the model , we recall ( see sec .",
    "i ) that important inconsistencies in the theoretical predictions emerged already when considering the presumably simple case of two correlated ( namely , @xmath9-)@xcite orbitals only , such as in the case of bulk nickelates@xcite and ni - based heterostructures@xcite .",
    "hence , we will introduce here two models ( distinguished for the different basis - sets ) , built with tetragonal symmetry , allowing for the simplest realization of the above - mentioned situation of two correlated orbitals ( identified with the two @xmath9 @xmath1-orbitals ) in the presence of a mimal number of extended ligand orbitals ( henceforth associated to @xmath0-orbitals ) .",
    "the models are inspired , to some extent , by the realistic calculations of nickelate heterostructures , i.e. with a focus on the orbital polarization in a quasi two - dimensional geometry .",
    "however , we will not consider here spatial correlations beyond dmft@xcite , the `` dimensionality '' entering explicitly only via the @xmath22-summations defining the local quantities .",
    "therefore , the results will depend mainly on the `` effective '' crystal field splitting , on the orbital occupation and on the electronic kinetic energies .",
    "furthermore , the general trends emerging from our dmft calculations are found to be stable w.r.t .",
    "the specific parameter choice of the @xmath18 and @xmath1-only models we are going to consider .",
    "hence , our study will provide useful indications to identify and clarify the global trends of the multi - orbital physics of this class of systems , _ at the dmft level_.    specifically , the model hamiltonians considered will be the following :    1 .",
    "the one - particle model hamiltonian for the larger basis - set , from which we start conceptually , is a @xmath18 four - band model ( fig.[fig01 ] upper panels ) , that includes explicitly two correlated @xmath1-orbitals ( e.g. , the nickel @xmath23-@xmath9 states ) , and two ligand ( e.g. , oxygen @xmath24 states ) .",
    "2 .   the model for the smaller",
    "basis - set is the ( lwdin ) downfolded@xcite version of the first one on the two correlated ( e.g. @xmath23-@xmath9 ) orbitals : it corresponds to the two - orbital @xmath1-only band - structure , shown with the corresponding orbital character in fig.[fig01 ] ( lower panels ) .",
    "note that , due to the downfolding , the band structure of the two models at the fermi level are identical by construction . yet",
    "the associated orbital character is different .",
    "while dmft calculations are often performed first in the smallest possible basis - set , for the definition of our one - particle model hamiltonians it is conceptually more logical to start from a larger ( @xmath18 ) basis - set . in our case , this includes two correlated @xmath1-orbitals and two ligand @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "the specific dispersion considered corresponds to a quasi two - dimensional geometry of the model , which can be thought of as one @xmath25- and one @xmath26-orbital on each ligand site .",
    "the overlap between the ligand orbitals and the two @xmath9 orbital gives the largest contribution to the hopping processes ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , for the sake of simplicity , the smaller direct hopping among @xmath1-orbitals is neglected ( @xmath28 ) . furthermore , in our one - particle hamiltonian the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 manifold",
    "are kept well distinguishble , in that a large enough @xmath18 splitting is assumed ( see below for details ) .",
    "these choices correspond to the minimal @xmath18 model with a realistic @xmath18 configuration in a ( quasi two dimensional ) cubic / tetragonal symmetry .",
    "the specific values of the parameters , e.g. , the @xmath18-hopping amplitude ( @xmath27 ) , on - site @xmath1/@xmath0 energies , and crystal field splitting among the @xmath1-orbitals ( @xmath29 ) have therefore been chosen to obtain a reasonable bandwidth for the bands close to the fermi level .",
    "our choice also ensures that the positive / negative values assumed by the splitting @xmath30 between the two downfolded @xmath1-orbitals in the small basis - set are plausible . this way we build up a one - particle low - energy hamiltonian similar to the 4-band cuprate hamiltonian derived in ref . , whereas the role of our `` axial '' orbital @xmath11 is played by the @xmath31-orbital of cu .",
    "formally , our @xmath18 hamiltonian in momentum space reads :    @xmath32    where the lattice spacing @xmath33 , @xmath34ev and @xmath35$]ev ( @xmath36$]ev ) for the reason explained above .",
    "the on - site energy of the @xmath0-states was fixed to @xmath37ev similar to the position of the @xmath0-bands in the nickelate systems . as for the fermi level",
    ", the model is assumed to have typically overall filling of @xmath38 electrons .",
    "this would correspond , ideally , to the situation of filled ligand bands and to a quarter - filled correlated two - band manifold at the fermi level .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , we show the band - structure of the four - band @xmath18 model corresponding to the two extreme values of @xmath29 we considered . in the band - structure and",
    "dos plots the black / red color encodes the @xmath1-character ( @xmath14/@xmath11 , respectively ) , and the yellow color encodes the @xmath0-character .",

    ", we note that , while locally the two @xmath9-orbitals are eigenstates of the tetragonal point group and do not hybridize ( pure black / red color of the dos ) , they do obviously hybridize non - locally along certain directions ( dark - red color , e.g. at the x point of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the overall width ( as well as the associated kinetic energy ) of the @xmath11 dos is smaller than the @xmath14 one , a typical feature of anisotropic materials and/or heterostructures with a quasi two - dimensional hopping geometry with suppressed hopping along the @xmath40-axis . more importantly for our purposes",
    ", we stress how the different original values of @xmath29 in the @xmath18 basis - sets correspond to situations with negative / positive difference between the center of mass of the non - interacting dos of our @xmath1-only model .",

    "we stress here , that @xmath30 can be interpreted , to a certain extent , as `` crystal field '' within the @xmath1-only manyfold .",
    "however , by adopting such a `` rough '' definition , one should keep in mind that @xmath30 is , in fact , a `` ligand field '' splitting , originated by an electrostatic madelung potential _ and _ a @xmath18-hybridization splitting .    before discussing some technical aspects of our dmft implementation in the next subsection",
    ", we recall that related two - band model hamiltonians , but _ without _ hybridization between the @xmath1-orbitals , have been studied with dmft in ref .",

    "however , in consideration of the discrepancies appearing when extending the basis - set by including less - correlated ligand @xmath0-orbitals in the self - consistent dmft loop , we will explicitly recall here some technical aspects of the dmft algorithmic procedure usually adopted in the cases of the extended @xmath18-basis - sets .",
    "extended models including ligand @xmath0-states explicitly have a structure like our 4-band hamiltonian ( [ eq : dpmodel ] ) . locally , i.e. integrated over the brillouin zone , such hamiltonian has the form :    @xmath43    the local basis is typically chosen in a way that the @xmath44 and @xmath45 blocks can be made internally diagonal after * k*integration so that the states can be labeled by a good _ local _ quantum number in the respective subspaces , such as the crystal field labels ( see dos plots in fig .",

    "note that the specific interaction values for the dmft calculations ( see next section for details ) have been chosen in order to reproduce a typical correlated metallic situation .",
    "due to the stronger localization of the @xmath1-orbitals in the @xmath18 models , the corresponding values of the local interaction on the @xmath1-orbitals have been correspondingly enhanced ( we assumed here a factor two for the parameter @xmath48 ) .",

    "specifically , for @xmath81 we observe generally an enhancement ( reduction ) of the occupation of the first(second ) , @xmath14- ( @xmath11- ) orbital , while for @xmath82 the trend is the opposite .",

    ", it appears that the high - frequency values of the self - energy do not represent the `` crucial '' parameter .",
    "instead , the trends in the orbital polarization and , therefore , the predicted physics are controlled by the low - frequency behavior of the self - energy : up to the mit the shape of the fermi surface is determined by the `` effective '' cf splitting given by @xmath94 i.e. as the original crystal field corrected by the difference of the real self - energies for @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig4_dp ] , the qualitative behavior as a function of @xmath30 appears similar as in the @xmath1-only case .",
    "however , an important difference should be noted : in spite of the relatively large separation ( @xmath105ev ) between @xmath1- and @xmath0-bands , the total occupation of the @xmath1-orbitals is now much larger than before ( @xmath106 ) due to the @xmath18 hybridization .",
    "quite remarkably , according to our dmft results of fig .",
    "[ fig4_dp ] , such an enhanced occupation of the `` correlated '' @xmath1-orbitals essentially survives also upon switching on the local interaction .",
    "this fact has an obvious impact on the final results for the orbital polarization @xmath83 , as now the sign of its change w.r.t .",

    "the analysis of the corresponding self - energies provides a further confirmation : fig .",
    "[ fig5_dp ] shows the plot of the zero frequency extrapolation of the real part of the self - energy ( compare to [ fig3_dp ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath1-only results now the interaction correction always reduces the initial crystal field , in agreement with the systematic depletion of the @xmath14-orbital ( reduction of @xmath83 ) observed in the whole parameter range considered .    on the basis of these results , it is interesting to examine the consequences for the shape of the fermi surfaces ( fs ) in the different cases . in fig .",
    "[ fig6_dp ] we show the fermi surfaces for two different values of @xmath30 for both the @xmath1-only and the @xmath18 basis - sets . in the upper row",
    "we show the non - interacting result and in the lower row the dmft one . in particular , the two values of @xmath30 have been chosen to present the extreme cases within our data range ( provided that the solution is metallic and has a fs ) . as for the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig6_dp ] , we start by considering the non - interacting fs of the upper row for the two different basis - sets : as a consequence of the lwdin downfolding , the shape of non - interacting fs corresponding to the same values of @xmath30 coincide , while the orbital character encoded by the colors differs in that the @xmath0 contribution is explicitly present in the @xmath18 case .",
    "additionally , for each case considered , the contribution to the fs of the @xmath11-orbital ( encoded by the red color and responsible for the formation of the `` cylindric''-shaped fs sheet around the @xmath107-point ) is stronger for negative values of @xmath30 than for positive .    by looking at the dmft data ( lower row ) for the @xmath18 4-band model",
    ", we see that the overall negative correction to @xmath86 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig5_dp ] gives a definite trend for the fermi surfaces : in the @xmath18 case , the interaction , _ independently _ of the sign of @xmath30 always enhances the @xmath11 contribution .",
    "this is reflected both in the orbital composition ( the interacting fs contain more red ) and in the shape ( enlargement of the central fs sheet ) . at the same time , our dmft data unveil quite different trends for the interacting fs of the @xmath1-only model : the @xmath11 contribution is enhanced _ only _ for @xmath82 , i.e. , only if the @xmath11 was from the beginning the lowest lying of the @xmath9-orbitals .",
    "in fact , coherently with the behavior of @xmath86 ( see fig .  [ fig3_dp ] ) , for positive values of @xmath30 , the interaction further reduces the @xmath11 contribution to the fs , which becomes progressively `` darker '' colored and more `` @xmath108''-shaped .",
    "let us note that , depending on the details of the dispersion of the specific @xmath1-only problem , there are cases in which , for @xmath109 the non - interacting fs still presents two - sheets , but the reduction of the @xmath11-character predicted by dmft , determines a transition to a single sheet fs in the interacting case , analogous to the one calculated in ref . .    summarizing the main outcome of the comparsion of our dmft calculations in different basis - sets for orbital occupations , crystal field corrections and fermi surface evolution , an evident _ qualitative _",
    "disagreement is observed , at least in the region of positive values of the initial crystal field @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth noticing that for positive values of @xmath30 , the trend we found in the @xmath18-basis - set is consistent with the results of the @xmath18 calculations for the ni - based heterostructures of ref . :",
    "there , it was shown , that even when starting from a relatively significant orbital polarization for the @xmath14-orbital at the lda level , the polarization was always strongly reduced by the interaction , which obviously has bad implications on the possibility of actually manipulating the fermi surfaces of the ni - based heterostructures in the `` desired '' cuprate - like way @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this discrepancy between @xmath1-only and @xmath18 results has been found here by also including the su(2 ) symmetry of the local interaction on the @xmath9-bands in both dmft calculations .",
    "this confirms the hypothesis of ref . that such a discrepancy in the theoretical predictions does not originate from a different treatment of the interactions between the calculations of refs . and @xcite , but rather from some more intrinsic difference in the calculations .",
    "the most evident systematic difference is the filling @xmath110 of the two @xmath9-orbitals , which , due to the @xmath18 hybridization is strongly increased w.r.t .",
    "the quarter - filling level of the @xmath1-only model .",
    "while this is rather obvious at the lda level , we note that the occupation of the @xmath1 manifold does not change much even in presence of the interaction , for typical choices of the double - counting term for the dmft ( see sec .",
    "ii , for details , and also ref . ) . quite interestingly , the possible role of an enhanced @xmath1-orbital occupation in @xmath18 calculations has been also recently addressed , for the different problem of the occurrence of the mit@xcite .",
    "the point we make here is that the hund s exchange @xmath21 has a strikingly different effect in the @xmath1-only and in the @xmath18 models , due to the fact that , close to half - filling , @xmath21 drives the system very effectively towards the hund s rule high - spin ground state @xcite . for the orbital polarization",
    "this means that @xmath21 does not play a decisive role for the quarter - filled @xmath1-only model while it becomes extremely important in the @xmath18 model , where @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath18 results can indeed be reconciled qualitatively if the hund s coupling @xmath21 for the @xmath18 model is equal to @xmath111ev or smaller .",

    "[ fig7_dp ] , in which the @xmath18 calculations have been performed reducing the value of @xmath21 from @xmath112ev to @xmath113ev , and @xmath114ev ( @xmath115ev is kept fixed , instead ) .    the combined analysis of the orbital occupation and of the self - energy ( at @xmath76 )",
    "results shows that the @xmath18 results of fig [ fig4_dp ] and [ fig5_dp ] change qualitatively already for the case @xmath113ev : the overall trend of strong reduction of occupation of the first @xmath14-orbital disappears for a large region of values of the initial crystal field @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the results already at @xmath21=0.5ev would lead to a physical situation which is qualitatively similar to that predicted by the @xmath1-only model . as one can expect , the change with respect to the previous @xmath18 results becomes even larger when setting @xmath114ev , as both trends of orbital occupation and effective crystal field become exactly opposite , with the @xmath14-orbital occupation always increased by the interaction irrespectively of the value of the initial @xmath30 .",
    "the sensitivity of the final @xmath18 results on the hund s coupling is very illustrative and shows the crucial role of the hund s exchange in this situation@xcite .",
    "from the marked discrepancy between @xmath18 and @xmath1 results , discussed in the previous section , a general question naturally arises : under which conditions can one expect to obtain a qualitatively similar dmft description of the interaction effects for @xmath1-only and @xmath18 calculations ?",
    "let us assume here that we have a very accurate estimate @xcite of the local interactions and especially of the hund s exchange @xmath21 .",
    "one of the most basic differences between the @xmath1-only and the @xmath18 calculations examined is the different value of the occupation of the @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "this difference is observed already at the level of the non - interacting model and is , remarkably , not strongly affected by the inclusion of the interaction : for the @xmath1-only model , the dmft calculations have been performed , as usual , at fixed filling , while the value of @xmath1-orbital occupation for the @xmath18 calculations presents moderate oscillations around a much larger value of @xmath116 , quite independently of the parameter set ( @xmath46,@xmath21,@xmath30 ) considered .",
    "since the filling of the _ correlated _ orbitals is a crucial factor to drive the system towards a mott - hubbard mit , this will naturally represent one of the key parameters to be considered when comparing lda+dmft calculations on different basis - sets .        to make our statement more quantitative ,",
    "we have performed several additional dmft calculations for the same @xmath1-only model as in sec .",
    "ii , but now varying systematically @xmath110 from the original quarter - filling level up to the much higher @xmath117 found in the @xmath18 calculations .",
    "the results for the orbital occupations and the self - energy at the fermi level are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8_dp ] in the upper and lower - row panels , respectively .",
    "by gradually increasing the total occupation of the @xmath1-orbitals , and focusing on the most interesting regime of @xmath81 , one observes that the parameter region where the crystal field `` drives '' the final result ( i.e. where its magnitude is enhanced by the interaction ) , shrinks , being confined to higher and higher values of the initial @xmath30 .",
    "looking at the self - energy plot for @xmath118 , a qualitative change in the trend of the effective crystal field w.r.t .",
    "the non - interacting one is found for @xmath119 .",
    "for @xmath120 the trend for the effective crystal field is _ opposite _ to that observed for quarter - filling , i.e. the original crystal field @xmath121 is _ reduced _ by the interaction .",
    "an analogous trend is also observed for the changes in the orbital occupations , w.r.t . the non - interacting ones .    by further increasing @xmath110 to @xmath122 ( second panels of fig .",
    "[ fig8_dp ] ) ) , the threshold @xmath123 is already shifted beyond the border of the parameter region considered ( @xmath124 ) . finally , if one performs the dmft @xmath1-only calculations for @xmath125 , which is roughly similar as in @xmath18 model , one indeed finds a similar behavior as for the @xmath18 model : the interaction correction to the crystal field ( fig .",
    "[ fig8_dp ] ) , overall negative for all positive values of @xmath30 considered , resembles that of the @xmath18 model in figs .",
    "[ fig5_dp ] , reflecting the tendency to deplete the @xmath108-orbital in presence of the electronic interaction .",
    "for a more general analyis of our data in the whole range of @xmath30 , let us first recall that , due to the different bandwidths of the two @xmath9-orbitals , no symmetric behavior between the regions of positive and negative @xmath30 can be expected .",
    "in particular , in the region @xmath82",
    "( i.e. , the less relevant one in the perspective of the ni - based heterostructures ) , the crystal field `` enhancement '' at quarter - filling was much larger than the corresponding one for @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3_dp ] ) , also as an effect of the closer proximity of the mit in this parameter region . hence , while the effects of an increased @xmath110 are always at work , here they become first visible as a gradual weakening of the quarter - filling trends ( e.g. , as a mitigation of the strongly negative correction to the effective crystal field for @xmath82 ) , before getting to an inversion of them : the gray shadow area , marking the onset of the mit for one of the two orbitals i.e. , the ( almost ) half - filled one , is shrinking in the @xmath126 plot , and essentially disappears at @xmath127 . only at higher densities",
    "one eventually observes a ( weak ) sign change of the effective crystal field correction at the lowest border of the parameter region considered ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the essential role played by the density of the @xmath1 manifold for determining the final dmft results on different basis - sets , at least for the important aspect of the fermi level properties .",
    "the starting value of @xmath110 will decide if , _ given a correct ab - initio estimate _ of the interaction parameters of the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian , the physics of the interacting system will be _ driven _ by the ( original ) crystal field , or rather by the hund s rule tendency for equally occupied orbitals .",
    "therefore , it will be _ a priori _ quite hard to reconcile dmft calculations performed on different basis - sets , without considering the corresponding occupation of the _ correlated _ manifolds .    from the perspective of actual material calculations ,",
    "the strong dependence of the final lda+dmft results for the ni - based heterostructures can be put in a rather general framework .",
    "in fact , the quarter - filling physics particularly favors the crystal field - dominated physics , since the hund s exchange is weaker in a system with one electron ( on average ) .",
    "hence , if the @xmath18 hybridization can drive the system away from this regime ( as is the @xmath18 model considered here with an average filling of @xmath117 ) , the hund s exchange will easily prevail over the crystal field effects .",
    "the same interpretation can likely explain , why the results of lda+dmft calculations for the fe - based superconductors do not display , in most cases , such crucial dependence on the basis - set considered .",
    "there , the five orbitals of the fe @xmath23 manifold are characterized by a small value of the _ overall _ orbital energy splitting @xmath129ev ( in comparison to the typical values of the order of @xmath103ev observed in many transition metal oxides ) .",
    "this corresponds to a situation of _ five _ partially filled ( @xmath130@xcite ) correlated orbitals all very close energetically to the fermi level , i.e. one of the most favorable playground for strong hund s exchange processes .",
    "hence , this case is well inside one of the two regimes , and moderate differences in the orbital occupation of the @xmath1 manifold in different basis - sets will _ not _ result in a qualitative discrepancy between different lda+dmft calculations , with the possible exception of the regimes closest to the mott transitions@xcite .",
    "we have thoroughly compared two models for transition metal oxides : a @xmath1-only model containing two effective @xmath1-orbitals and a @xmath18 model made of two @xmath1- and two @xmath0-orbitals . on the single - particle level without coulomb interaction ,",
    "the two models show the same low - energy physics and band - structure . however",
    "if the coulomb interaction is taken into account by means of dmft , this is not the case any more .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is the number of @xmath1-electrons . in the @xmath1-only model there is on average one @xmath1-electron per site . for the @xmath18 model on the other hand ,",
    "the bands are filled with altogether @xmath38 electrons per site : without hybridization the two @xmath0-orbitals at lower energy would be completely filled , and the @xmath1-orbitals in the vicinity of the fermi level would have the same filling ( one electron per site ) as for the @xmath1-only model .",
    "the @xmath1-orbitals hybridize however with the @xmath0-orbitals , and , hence , there is some admixture between the orbitals leading to a larger filling ( @xmath131 ) of the @xmath1-orbitals for the @xmath18 model .",
    "this different filling has dramatic consequences for the correlated solution of the two models . for the @xmath1-only model the coulomb interaction enhances the initial crystal field splitting , leading to a situation with one @xmath1-electron in the lowest - lying @xmath1-orbital .",
    "depending on the original crystal field ( e.g. , if @xmath81 ) , this can be the @xmath14-orbital , which hence dominates the low energy physics and fermi surface topology .",
    "this kind of physics can result in a very similar @xmath14-shaped fermi surface in ni - based heterostructures as in cuprates .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath18 model the hund s exchange favors a more even occupation of the two orbitals because the @xmath1 manifold is much closer to half - filling ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the initial crystal field splitting is therefore reduced and the local moment enhanced @xcite . however , if @xmath21 is low enough this tendency can be weakened recovering qualitatively the results of the @xmath1-only model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7_dp ] ) .",
    "vice versa , we have also verified that the @xmath1-only model displays a similar hund s physics as that of the @xmath18 model , if we enhance the @xmath1-electron occupation towards the one of the @xmath18 model .",
    "let us stress that , while an influence of the filling of the correlated manifold on the dmft results is not surprising in itself , our study identifies its crucial importance for the description of the low - energy physics .",
    "in particular , two important aspects have been determined : ( i ) the rapidity with which qualitative robust trends found in the @xmath1-only basis - sets can be reversed by slightly varying the density from the `` nominal '' one ( e.g , from @xmath39 in our case ) , ( ii ) the similarity of the interaction effects in different basis - sets observed in presence of a correspondingly similar occupation of the correlated orbitals .",
    "the findings of our model study have important consequences for the analysis and the interpretation of realistic lda+dmft calculations for several transition metal oxides and related correlated materials : the physical results for @xmath1-only lda+dmft calculations can indeed dramatically differ from calculations which also include the oxygen @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "in fact , since the additional @xmath0-orbitals lead to a different @xmath1-filling , this can determine the aforementioned dramatically different low - energy dmft physics .",
    "eventually , in the case of contradicting dmft prediction , experiments ( such as , e.g. , arpes or x - ray absorption spectroscopy or orbital reflectometry ) will show which of the two theoretical set - ups describes the physical reality better .",
    "furthermore we should note that , as the @xmath18 calculation is generally far away from an integer filling of the interacting @xmath1-orbitals , the occurrence of mott - hubbard metal - insulator transitions becomes more difficult@xcite .",
    "certainily one can expect non - local correlations beyond dmft@xcite to be of importance for ( quasi ) two - dimensional mott insulators .",
    "however , not showing a mott insulating phase in other specific cases might well be a deficit of the @xmath18 calculations or , at least , of the way such @xmath18 calculations are performed nowadays , e.g. , via the complete neglection of the @xmath18 interaction .",
    "let us emphasize , finally , that in other situations the physics of the @xmath1-only and @xmath18 calculation can be much more similar .",
    "this was e.g. observed in most of the dmft studies on iron pnictides . in these materials ,",
    "the presence of a large manifold of partially filled correlated @xmath23-orbitals all close to the fermi level is a common aspect for both @xmath18 and @xmath1-only calculations .",

    "<S> the effective crystal field in multi - orbital correlated materials can be either enhanced or reduced by electronic correlations with crucial consequences for the topology of the fermi surface and , hence , on the physical properties of these systems . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> recent local density approximation ( lda ) plus dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) studies of ni - based heterostructure have shown contradicting results , depending on whether the less correlated @xmath0-orbitals are included or not . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the origin of this problem and identify the key parameters controlling the fermi surface properties of these systems . without the @xmath0-orbitals </S>",
    "<S> the model is quarter filled , while the @xmath1 manifold moves rapidly towards half - filling when the @xmath0-orbitals are included . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the local hund s exchange , while rather unimportant for the former case , can play a predominant role in controlling the orbital polarization for the extended basis - set by favoring the formation of a larger local magnetic moment . </S>"
