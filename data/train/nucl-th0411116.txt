    "the surprising success of the statistical hadronization model in describing the multihadron production in high - energy nucleus - nucleus reactions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) as well as in elementary particle collisions @xcite gives rise to a question if the fluctuations , especially the second moments of multiplicity distributions , follow the statistical resonance gas results as well as the mean multiplicities ( the first momenta of multiplicities ) .",
    "even though the ce first momenta reach the gc values quite fast with increasing multiplicities @xcite , we have found that the variance of these values _ always _ stay different in the ce @xcite due to the lack of charge bath , i.e. due to the lack of fluctuations of the relevant net charges .",
    "in section [ theory ] we pose and solve the theoretical problems involved , and give results for the general hadron gas .",
    "the section [ numerical ] is devoted to the numerical studies employing the methods developed in previous section , and to the comparison of those with the ones given by the monte carlo ( mc ) procedure explained in ref .",
    "the central quantity in our discussion is the _ scaled variance _ of the multiplicity @xmath0 : @xmath1 this is a finite measurable parameter even at the infinite volume limit , and we will show it losing its volume dependence in large systems .",
    "it is worth stressing that for the poissonian distribution corresponding to boltzmann gc ensemble , @xmath2 .",
    "although we keep the theoretical discussion on the level of boltzmann approximation for brevity , we show also the full quantum statistics results in the section [ numerical ] .    in the ce ,",
    "the partition function does not factorize to one - species parts , but the different species are bound by the group factors giving delta functions over corresponding exact conservation laws . recall the form of the partition function for canonical hadron gas carrying baryon number @xmath3 , strangeness @xmath4 and electric charge @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6           z_{gc}(t , v,\\{\\lambda_{q_i}\\ } ) , \\label{eq : projection}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a @xmath9 group parameter and a wick - rotated fugacity factor @xmath10 is introduced for every charge in the grand canonical partition function @xmath11    by the substitution @xmath12 and still integrating over the three unit circles we may write    @xmath13    the first and second momenta of a given multiplicity of a hadron subset @xmath14 can be calculated by inserting fictitious fugacity to the generating function @xmath15 in equation ( [ eq : projection ] ) and performing the derivatives    @xmath16_{\\lambda_{j , i}=1 } & = \\sum_{j\\in h } z_j^1 \\frac{z_{\\vec{q}-{\\vec{q}}_j}}{z_{\\vec{q } } } +   \\sum_{j\\in h}z_j^1\\sum_{i\\in h}z_i^1 \\frac{z_{\\vec{q}-{\\vec{q}}_j-{\\vec{q}}_i}}{z_{\\vec{q}}}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using these , the scaled variance can be written as the sum of poissonian part and the canonical correction : @xmath17    for the large systems , the canonical correction factors can be solved by means of the asymptotic expansion , where the saddlepoint of the @xmath18 ( [ eq : partx ] ) coincides with the values of gc fugacities @xcite . in the general case of multi - hadron gas carrying total charges @xmath19 the asymptotic expansion of the partition function involves diagonalization of the hessian matrix    @xmath20 \\langle n_j \\rangle_{\\mathrm{gc}}\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    because this is real and symmetric , the diagonalization is done by the orthogonal matrix @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the hessian eigenvalues , and @xmath24 is constructed of corresponding eigenvectors . applying these and the notation @xmath25 for gc average multiplicities , the large volume limit of the eq .",

    ", we consider the scaled variance for the number of positively ( @xmath30 ) and negatively ( @xmath31 ) charged particles as well as the sum of all charged particles neglecting the multi - charged particles and the mixing between different charges ( non - diagonals in the hessian ) .",

    "yields @xmath36 this result serves as a `` rule of thumb '' for any charge under consideration  it applies trivially to baryons and strange particles too  but in quantitative comparisons one must relax the approximations used above . in case of one - charge system , such as pion gas ,",
