    "signals from supersymmetry ( susy ) are important targets for particle physics experiments .",
    "these signals range from the direct discovery of supersymmetric particles at high energy colliders to indirect signals at lower energy experiments through measurements of flavor - changing processes , magnetic and electric dipole moments , and so on .",
    "the set of possible signals and the promise of individual experiments for susy searches depend strongly on what model of susy breaking is assumed .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the characteristic features and predictions of well - motivated susy breaking scenarios .",
    "probably the most well - known scenario is that of susy breaking in the supergravity framework , i.e. , `` gravity - mediated '' susy breaking . in this framework ,",
    "susy breaking originates in a hidden sector and is transmitted to the observable sector though planck scale - suppressed operators . in particular , soft masses for squarks , sleptons , and higgs bosons are induced by direct khler interactions between hidden and observable sector fields .",
    "unfortunately , these khler interactions are not , in general , flavor - diagonal .",
    "squark and slepton mass matrices therefore typically have large flavor mixings , and these induce unacceptably large flavor - changing processes , such as @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "these difficulties , together commonly referred to as the susy flavor problem , may be avoided if the khler potential is somehow constrained to be flavor - diagonal .",
    "gauge - mediated susy breaking  @xcite is one proposal for solving this problem .",
    "recently the mechanism of `` anomaly - mediated ''",
    "susy breaking has been proposed as a possibility for generating ( approximately ) flavor - diagonal squark and slepton mass matrices  @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", susy is again broken in a hidden sector , but it is now transmitted to the observable sector dominantly via the super - weyl anomaly  @xcite .",
    "gaugino and scalar masses are then related to the scale dependence of the gauge and matter kinetic functions . for first and second generation fields ,",
    "whose yukawa couplings are negligible , wavefunction renormalization is almost completely determined by gauge interactions .",
    "their anomaly - mediated soft scalar masses are thus almost diagonal , and the susy flavor problem is solved .",
    "note that this solution requires that the anomaly - mediated terms be the dominant contributions to the susy breaking parameters .",
    "this possibility may be realized , for example , if susy breaking takes place in a different world , i.e. , on a brane different from the 3-brane of our world , and direct khler couplings are thereby suppressed  @xcite .    as will be discussed below",
    ", the expressions for anomaly - mediated susy breaking terms are scale - invariant .",
    "thus , they are completely determined by the known low energy gauge and yukawa couplings and an overall mass scale @xmath1 .",
    "anomaly - mediated susy breaking is therefore highly predictive , with fixed mass ratios motivating distinctive experimental signals , such as macroscopic tracks from highly degenerate wino - like lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one such prediction , assuming minimal particle content , is that sleptons are tachyons .",
    "several possible solutions to this problem have already been proposed  @xcite .",
    "we will adopt a phenomenological approach , first taken in ref .",
    "@xcite , and assume that the anomaly - mediated scalar masses are supplemented by an additional universal contribution @xmath9 . for large enough @xmath2 , the slepton squared masses are positive .",
    "along with the requirement of proper electroweak symmetry breaking , this defines the minimal anomaly - mediated model in terms of only 3 + 1 parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , and @xmath10 is the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "the simplicity of this model allows one to thoroughly examine all of parameter space .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of the phenomenology of the minimal anomaly - mediated model .",

    "[ sec : amsb ] with a brief discussion of the mechanism of anomaly - mediated susy breaking . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mam ] we review the tachyonic slepton problem and the universal @xmath2 `` solution , '' and present in detail the minimal anomaly - mediated model described above .",
    "the universal scalar mass @xmath2 breaks the simple scale invariance of expressions for soft terms .",
    "however , this breaking is rather minimal , in a sense to be explained , and the minimal anomaly - mediated model inherits several simple properties from the pure anomaly - mediated case .",
    "the naturalness of this model is examined in sec .  [",
    "sec : naturalness ] .",
    "we find that the minimal anomaly - mediated model exhibits a novel renormalization group ( rg ) `` focus point '' ( as opposed to fixed point ) behavior , which allows slepton and squark masses to be well above their usual naturalness bounds .",

    "the wino lsp scenario is realized in a large fraction of parameter space and has important new implications for both collider physics  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we find that naturalness and electroweak symmetry breaking favor light winos with the smallest possible mass splittings , i.e. , the ideal region of parameter space for wino searches and within the discovery reach of run ii of the tevatron .",
    "while anomaly - mediated models have the virtue that they predict very little flavor - changing in the first and second generations , they are not therefore automatically safe from all low - energy probes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowenergy ] we analyze several sensitive low - energy processes : @xmath5 , which probes flavor - changing in the third generation , and three important flavor-_conserving _ observables , the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon , and the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron .",

    "in supergravity , susy breaking parameters always receive anomaly - mediated contributions .",
    "however , in the usual gravity - mediated susy breaking scenario , susy breaking masses also arise from direct interactions of observable sector fields with hidden sector susy breaking fields .",
    "such contributions are usually comparable to the gravitino mass , and so anomaly - mediated contributions , which are loop - suppressed relative to the gravitino mass , are sub - leading . however , in a model with no direct coupling between observable and hidden sectors , the anomaly - mediated terms can be the dominant contributions . in this paper , we assume that this is the case , and that the anomaly - mediated terms are ( one of ) the leading contributions to the susy breaking parameters .",

    "the maximum allowed @xmath9 is thus roughly an order of magnitude below @xmath100 .",

    "<S> three lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) candidates exist : the wino , the stau , and the tau sneutrino . for the wino lsp scenario , light wino triplets with the smallest possible mass splittings are preferred ; such winos are within reach of run ii tevatron searches . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study a variety of sensitive low energy probes , including @xmath5 , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , and the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron .    </S>",
