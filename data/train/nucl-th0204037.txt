    "the special theory of relativity starts with the fundamental two postulates which are for relativity and the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames @xcite .",
    "the transformation between inertial frames is known as the lorentz transformation which satisfies the two postulates .",
    "therefore physical quantities and formulas are the same forms in all inertial frames .",
    "this is achieved by using the four vector notation which is combined with the space and time components , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and so on @xcite .",
    "however the separate notation of four vectors does not show the covariance manifestly in the transformation equations . the transformed coordinate system used in the standard texts @xcite has a little complicated transformation formulas , such as , @xmath3 thus , it is often doubtful that the transformed coordinate system has the same physical formulas as the original coordinate system has .",
    "these transformation equations are not true vector forms .",
    "they are merely components of the vector equation , because the basis vectors are used in common in the two frames .",
    "physical quantities are measured in an inertial frame with its own units of time and length .",
    "physical formulas composed of these quantities which are scalars , vectors or tensors are formed in a frame with its own unit vectors .",
    "therefore it is difficult to say relativity in the two frames with the above equations , because the transformed equations often suffer from unwanted factors , such as , the @xmath4 factor . due to this trouble maker , the biot - savart law , for an example in electromagnetism , is explained with sophisticated terms , such as , the duration time of measurement for the magnetic field come from the transformed electric field of a moving charged particle @xcite .",

    ". then the vector form of the velocity is @xmath10_{ij } ( v_j + \\epsilon_{jkl } \\omega_k x_l ) \\hat{e}'_i \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( v_j + \\epsilon_{jkl } \\omega_k x_l ) \\hat{e}_j \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } + \\mbox{\\boldmath{$ \\omega$ } } \\times\\mbox{\\boldmath{$r$}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unprimed basis vectors are transformed as @xmath11_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the acceleration is @xmath12_{ij } ( a_j + \\epsilon_{jkl } \\omega_k \\epsilon_{lmn } \\omega_m x_n + 2 \\epsilon_{jkl } \\omega_k v_l ) , \\label{accel}\\ ] ] where we consider a constant angular velocity .",
    "the vector form of the above equation is @xmath13 and , if a mass is multiplied to the equation , the newton s law is @xmath14 where the second term is the centrifugal force and the last term is the coriolis force as shown in the standard texts @xcite .",
    "therefore the position vectors in the two frames are written by @xmath15_{ij}x_j \\hat{e}'_i =   x_j \\hat{e}_j = \\mbox{\\boldmath{$r$}},\\ ] ] irrespective of the rotation angle which is constant or varying with time .",
    "since the mass times acceleration is expressed as the same forms in the two frames , the newton s law can be said to be expressed as covariant manner in the vector representation rather than in the component representation of the vector .",
    "there is no rotation matrix , namely , an unwanted factor , in eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) compared to eq .",
    "( [ accel ] ) .",
    "therefore the correct vector form of the lorentz transformation should be expressed with its own components and unit vectors .",
    "it is more natural that relativity can be expected after obtaining the correct vector form of the lorentz transformation . as learned from non - relativistic kinematics ,",
    "if a physical phenomenon is described with a geometrical picture , it is much easier to comprehend it .",
    "the correct vector forms of the lorentz transformation are well interpreted with geometrical pictures , which are the law of cosines and sines in hyperbolic trigonometry .",
    "it is of course already known that the velocity space of the special theory of relativity is a lobatchewsky space , that is , a hyperbolic space @xcite , but our interpretation gives more clear extended explanation for the hyperbolic space .",
    "so the thomas precession can be interpreted as the time rate of the angle defect .",
    "the outline of this paper is that a rotational transformation is adapted to a lorentz transformation in section ii in order to obtain the correct vector form of the lorentz transformation , the method of calculation for invariant quantities under the lorentz transformation and the geometrical interpretations of the lorentz transformation . in section",
    "iii , most of basic physical quantities are investigated under the lorentz transformation according to the guidelines of section ii , and developed further . in section iv",
    ", the lorentz transformation for an energy and a momentum is shown to be the law of cosines and sines in hyperbolic trigonometry . finally some conclusions are given . since spherical and hyperbolic",
    "trigonometries are not seen in the standard texts for physics , they are introduced in appendices a and b. spherical trigonometry is very useful to introduce an angle vector as shown in appendix a and to comprehend hyperbolic trigonometry and its space .",
    "a lorentz transformation is similar to a rotational transformation , if the relative velocity @xmath16 between two frames is regarded as tangent of a rotational angle @xmath17 , that is , @xmath18 .",
    "so the converse of the similarity is also true and gives us a good insight for the special theory of relativity .",
    "moreover they are expressed as the same transformation formulas in the euclidean space time .",
    "a rotated coordinate system @xmath19 with an angle @xmath20 around the z - axis of a coordinate system @xmath21 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has the components as follows @xmath22 then let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be assigned to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the above transformation becomes similar to a lorentz transformation as follows @xmath27 where @xmath4 is used as @xmath25 only in this section .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the difference between the rotational and the lorentz transformations comes from that between the metrics in the two transformations , if the coordinate @xmath28 is regarded as time axis and the coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 are done as space axes .",
    "hence the signs before the terms involving @xmath16 are different from those of the lorentz transformation .",
    "the vector forms of the lorentz transformation used in the standard texts@xcite are again written in the version of this rotational transformation by @xmath31 where the basis vectors are used in common in the two coordinate systems .",

    "are connected via this new relative velocity .",
    "the definition of the new relative velocity is exactly correct in a sense that , if we consider it in general situation , namely , curvilinear coordinate systems , the variation of a vector should take into account both its component and unit vector , such as , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the definition of a velocity should be @xmath37 even in the rectangular coordinate system , because the basis vectors are defined only in an inertial frame .",
    "the @xmath28 coordinate has the following transformation : @xmath38 because the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the two coordinate systems are identical as follows @xmath41 and we get the following equation : @xmath42 the component forms of the lorentz transformation to which we are accustomed can be calculated by multiplying the basis vectors to eqs .",

    "the origins of the two inertial frames which are the frame of a muon rest frame and the frame of an observer on the earth are coincided at the position and time that a muon is produced in the atmosphere by a cosmic ray .",

    "an inverse lorentz transformation can be obtained by applying the inverse matrix of the transformation to the transformation matrix equation eq .",

    "the unit vector of the relative velocity in the primed coordinate system is , therefore , calculated as @xmath81 which joins the first line of the transformation matrix equation for the basis vectors and forms a pair of the lorentz transformation for the unit vectors as follows @xmath82 where two unit vectors of @xmath83",
    "which are orthogonal to @xmath84 can be chosen as the remaining space basis vectors . using the transformation matrix equations for the coordinate and the unit vectors , the scalar and vector products of the unit vector of the relative velocity to the position vector in the primed coordinate system",
    "are directly calculated as @xmath85 where the vector product is not well defined in relativity .",
    "such an unsatisfactory definition may be due to a non - commutative property between the operation of a vector product and the lorentz transformation , or insufficient definitions for the extended indices , @xmath86 in the four dimension for a vector product . anyway the operation after the transformation needs a transformation rule for the vector product itself , that is , the symbol @xmath87 , but the transformation after the operation does not need to do so .",

    "( [ usualvectr ] ) can be also obtained form the scalar and vector products of the primed unit vector of the relative velocity to the transformed position vector as follows @xmath98 by using the above new relative velocity and the transformation for the unit vector .",

    "it is an interesting question whether an axial vector has the same transformation property or not .",
    "an angular momentum vector is the very axial vector .",
    "since the definition of an angular momentum vector consists of a position vector and a momentum vector for which we know well the lorentz transformation properties , by using the prescription for a vector product and the transformation matrices for the coordinate and the momentum , an angular momentum in the primed frame is calculated as @xmath179 where it is easy to calculate the transformation for @xmath180 by replacing the basis vectors in the above equation with the direction cosines of @xmath133 . at first view the angular momentum seems to be transformed like an unit vector under the lorentz transformation , but dose not so because it is difficult to confirm that @xmath181 .",
    "the best way in this situation is to calculate the transformation property of the magnitude of the angular momentum : @xmath182 where the following invariant relation : @xmath183 is used , which is similar to the equation @xmath184 .",
    "the magnitude of an angular momentum is not an invariant quantity in relativity , but invariant with @xmath185 .",
    "so it is necessary to calculate the transformation property of this physical quantity as follows @xmath186 this calculation shows some hints on the transformation property for the angular momentum , but not satisfactory . since a double cross product physical quantity can be represented as scalar product physical quantities , the following quantity for an angular momentum can be transformed properly under the lorentz transformation as @xmath187 \\sinh \\vartheta,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last term has the following transformation property : @xmath188 \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\hat{n } \\times [ \\hat{n } \\times ( e \\mbox{\\boldmath{$r$ } } - t \\mbox{\\boldmath{$p$ } } ) ] \\cosh \\vartheta + \\hat{n } \\times \\mbox{\\boldmath{$l$ } } \\sinh \\vartheta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is interesting that this transformation should be compared with eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) .",
    "thus the above two transformation equations and the invariance of the transverse components of the angular momentum and @xmath189 are regarded as the transformation rules for the angular momentum .",

    "so they transform like an axial vector under the lorentz transformation as follows @xmath194 this transformation shows that the origin of a magnetic field is due to the lorentz transformation @xcite , and is consistent with the biot - savart law . from this transformation property , the invariant quantity for the electromagnetic field can be obtained as @xmath195 since the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields are invariant under the lorentz transformation , if they are dropped out , the remaining parts are also invariant as follows @xmath196 which is known as the norm of electromagnetic 2-form or faraday @xcite .",

    "this equation shows that the angular velocity regarded as a proper vector in the standard texts has the same properties as the angle vector defined above .",
    "the angular acceleration is also calculated in the same way as the angular velocity is done .",
    "considering that the angular velocities of the rotation and the precession for a symmetrical top can not be interchanged , non - commutative properties of the rotations as mentioned in the standard texts @xcite may not be a proper reason for the insufficient definition of an angle vector .",
    "as the same way , we can not rotate a symmetrical top after precessing by using an angular acceleration , that is , a non - rotating symmetrical top does not precess .",
    "this angle vector addition rule also appears partly in the matrix for the eulerian angles in the rigid body motion .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a hyperbolic space directly which is known as a lobatchewsky space @xcite .",
    "so the hyperbolic space is supposed to be the space on an unit sphere as shown in the previous section with an imaginary radius which can be called a hyperbolic sphere here .",
    "if the metric for the space part is taken as @xmath303 , then the sine and cosine of the angle vector are written by hyperbolic sine and cosine as follows @xmath304 due to the metric the sum of two hyperbolic angle vectors is expressed with hyperbolic sines and cosines as @xmath305 where the last equation should have an imaginary term in order that the cosine squared and sine squared should be unity . since the last term is not imaginary in the scalar equation as @xmath306 which is also derived from the laws of sines and cosines for a hyperbolic triangle and its polar triangle as shown below .",
    "therefore , in principle , it may be possible to derive another form of law of sine in vector form as follows @xmath307 which is obtained in section iv in a different way as shown in appendix a.    the unit vectors for the directions of the hyperbolic angle vectors are defined globally , as shown in the spherical space , in the hyperbolic space where the triangle is .",
    "it is difficult to calculate the operations between such unit vectors because we do nt know how to draw the unit vectors in the hyperbolic space .",
    "instead of treating the unit vectors in such a way , it is much more proper and easy to treat the unit vectors as local variables than global ones at the starting and end points of the hyperbolic angle vectors . since a velocity in the lorentz transformation",
    "can be represented as a hyperbolic angle , the directions of the relative velocities in two inertial frames are defined as the unit vectors at the starting point and the end point of the hyperbolic angle on the hyperbolic sphere . therefore the unit vectors defined locally in the hyperbolic space are well interpreted as physical quantities and treated easily .",
