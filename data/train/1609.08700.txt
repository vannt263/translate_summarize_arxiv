    "the non - keplerian rotation curves of spiral galaxies provided the first observational evidence that galaxies are embedded in extensive dark matter haloes ( @xcite ) .",
    "historically , the 21-cm emission from atomic neutral hydrogen gas ( hi ) has been the main tool to derive galaxy rotation curves , because of its capability to trace the gravitational field beyond the optical stellar disc .",
    "however , hi is less useful in constraining the rotation curve in the central parts of discs usually due to insufficient spatial resolution and the lack of hi gas in the inner parts of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the interstellar medium in the centre is instead dominated by gas in the molecular and ionised phases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the rotation curves derived through co emission , the common tracer for the molecular gas distribution , often show non - axisymmetric signatures such as wiggles ( @xcite ) .",
    "hot ionised gas has the additional disadvantage that the observed rotation alone is often insufficient to trace the total mass distribution and that its velocity dispersion needs to be included .",
    "this velocity dispersion is generally influenced by a typically unknown contribution from non - gravitational effects such as stellar winds and shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these shortcomings of gas tracers can be overcome through careful correction and analysis .",
    "however , a broader shortcoming of gas tracers becomes apparent because of their dissipative nature .",
    "the gas is easily disturbed by perturbations in the plane from , for example , a bar or spiral arm ( @xcite ) .",
    "gas also settles in the galaxy disc plane ( or polar plane ) and is thus less sensitive to the mass distribution perpendicular to it .",
    "the typical velocity dispersions of the neutral and ionized gas , respectively , are @xmath410 kms@xmath5(@xcite ) and @xmath420 kms@xmath5(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) .    instead of gas",
    ", stars could be used as a tracer of the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "stars are present in all galaxy types , are distributed in all three dimensions , and are collisionless making them less susceptible to perturbations .",
    "the random motion of the collisionless stars tipycally ranges from 20 kms@xmath5to above 300 kms@xmath5(@xcite ) .",
    "this implies a scale height difference of over an order of magnitude between the gaseous and stellar components ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    however , we need to measure both the ordered and random motions of stars before they can be used as a dynamical tracer . their random motion can be different in all three directions , an effect known as the velocity anisotropy .",
    "this anisotropy requires more challenging observational and modelling techniques to uncover the total mass distribution .",
    "nonetheless , these techniques are becoming available .",
    "integral - field spectrographs like ` sauron `  ( @xcite ) , which is used in this study , allow us to extract high - quality stellar kinematic maps and enable us to perform dynamical models .",
    "a common approach for spiral galaxies is to apply the asymmetric drift correction ( adc ; @xcite ) to infer the circular velocity curve from the measured stellar mean velocity and velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "this approach is straightforward since the velocity and dispersion profiles can be obtained from long - slit spectroscopy , and no line - of - sight integration is required due to an underlying thin - disc assumption .",
    "using this method requires assuming both the disc inclination and the magnitude of the velocity anisotropy . as such , the adc approach is widely adopted in studies that use the stellar kinematics to infer the circular velocity curve .",
    "for example , when investigating the tully - fisher relation for earlier - type spirals ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , the speed of bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as the inner distribution of dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we adopt an alternative approach , namely fitting a solution of the axisymmetric jeans equations to stellar mean velocity and velocity dispersion fields to infer mass distributions .",
    "we apply this approach to the data acquired with the integral - field spectrograph sauron from inner parts of 18 late - type sb  sd spiral galaxies .",
    "these jeans models are less general than orbit - based models ( e.g. , schwarzschild s method ; @xcite ) but are far less computationally expensive while still providing a good description of galaxies dominated by stars on disc - like orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the applicability of these fitted jeans solutions even applies to dynamically hot systems such as lenticular galaxies .",
    "the jeans models take into account the two - dimensional information in the stellar kinematic maps as well as integration along the line - of - sight .",
    "we also compare the resulting circular velocity curves with those obtained through adc to investigate the validity of the assumptions underlying the simpler adc approach .    in section  [ s : observations ] , we summarise the sample including the ` sauron `  observations and near - infrared imaging .",
    "the jeans and adc modelling approaches are described in section  [ s : method ] and applied via markov chain monte carlo technique in section  [ s : analysis ] .",
    "we then compare the circular velocity curves from both modelling approaches in section  [ s : vcirc ] and discuss the possible reasons for the significant differences we find in section  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ s : concl ] .",

    "_ constant anisotropy in the meridional plane ( jam ) : _ whereas the velocity anisotropy @xmath332 in the equatorial plane is inherent in the solution of the axisymmetric jeans equations ( section  [ ss : axijeans ] ) , the velocity anisotropy @xmath333 in the meridional plane is a free parameter , given as @xmath334 .",
    "there is little evidence for strong variation of @xmath72 .",
    "for example , @xcite already argued that for spirals the @xmath333 is constant at approximately 0.6 , close to the measured value of @xmath335 in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "this ratio of the anisotropy is measured in a few spirals of type sa to sbc @xcite , yielding slightly larger constant values between 0.6 and 0.8 .",
    "based on long - slit spectra for a sample of 17 edge - on sb  scd spirals , @xcite also adopt constant values , although slightly lower : 0.5 to 0.7 . while radial variation of the anisotropy is not excluded , a constant value of @xmath72 should be sufficient for our analysis .",

    "_ dust ( jam , adc ) : _ the surface brightness distribution of the spiral galaxies that is used in both jam and adc modelling approaches can be strongly affected by extinction due to dust .",
    "we have tried to minimise the effects of dust in various ways ( g09 ) : ( i ) selecting galaxies with intermediate inclinations so that they are not edge - on ( where dust extinction is strongest ) or face - on ( where the stellar velocity dispersion would be significantly below the spectral resolution ) , ( ii ) inferring the surface brightness distribution from images in the near - infrared where the extinction is significantly smaller than in the optical , and ( iii ) fitting smooth , analytical mge profiles to the radial surface brightness profile after azimuthally averaging over annuli to suppress deviations caused by bars , spiral arms , and regions obscured by dust .",
    "the stellar kinematics are obtained from integral - field spectroscopy in the optical and thus could also be affected if the ( giant ) stars that contribute along the line - of - sight with different motions are affected by the dust in different ways . for example , if dynamically colder stars closer to the disc plane are relatively more obscured than dynamically hotter stars above the disc plane , the resulting combined ordered - over - random motion could be biased to lower values .",
    "the effects of dust are strongly reduced for lines of sight only a few degrees away from edge - on ( @xcite ) and the effects of extinction on the line - of - sight velocity are negligible : the change in @xmath339 is only 1.3% higher from the dustless case ( @xcite ) . given the selection in our sample , the effects of dust on the inferred circular velocity curves from both modelling approaches are expected to be minimal .    _",
    "thin - disc ( adc ) : _ circular velocity curves of spirals nearly always come from ( cold ) gas , which is naturally in a thin disc .",
    "the stellar discs of these late - type spiral galaxies are also believed to be thin , with inferred intrinsic flattening @xmath340 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even the bulges in late - type spiral galaxies are different from the classical bulges in lenticular galaxies .",
    "srsic profile fits to their surface brightness ( @xmath341 ) show that towards later - types , the bulges are smaller in size , have profiles closer to exponential ( @xmath342 ) than de vaucouleurs ( @xmath343 ) , and are flatter ( e.g. , g09 ) .",
    "hence , the thin - disc assumption adopted in the adc approach also seems to be reasonable .",
    "independent of the nature of the dynamically hot stellar ( sub)system , it seems that the local value of the ordered - over - random motion is the key for understanding of the adc and jam discrepancy .    to explore that , in fig .",

    "however , they note that there is some indication that this becomes less true as velocity dispersion approaches the rotation speed , as we find in this study . it is not excluded that there are strong streaming motions in the centers of the ` sauron `  galaxies due to presence of non - axisymmetric features , which prevent an accurate asymmetric - drft correction .    nevertheless , some of the discrepancy might be arise from jam overestimation of the m / l ratio .",
    "@xcite showed that the overestimation can be severe in face - on barred system .",
    "@xcite also discussed the possibility of an overestimation of the @xmath376 ratio due to disk averaging over various stellar populations .",
    "we do not exclude the latter since the region probed by our data is in the central part of the galaxies , where multiple stellar populations can be present .",
    "the former case should not influence some of our measurements , since all of our galaxies have intermediate inclinations .    in future studies",
    ", we will explore further this problem using large statistical sample of galaxies and morphologies .",
    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , traced by atomic gas , provide the most direct path to estimate the total galaxy masses outside the stellar disc .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to measure the rotation curve in the central parts of the galaxies , where the ionized and molecular gas dominate .",
    "gas settles in the equatorial or polar plane and is thus less sensitive to the mass distribution perpendicular to it .",
    "gas is also dissipative and easily disturbed by perturbations in the plane from features like bars or spiral arms .",
    "thus , stars appear to be a better tracer as they are distributed in all three dimensions and , being collisionless , they are less sensitive to perturbations .",
    "however , stars are not cold tracers as they move in orbits that are neither circular nor confined to a single plane .",
    "we therefore need to measure both velocity dispersions and line - of - sight velocities to recover the total mass distribution of galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we compare two different approaches for inferring dynamical masses of spiral galaxies : the commonly used asymmetric drift correction ( adc ) and the axisymmetric jeans equations .",
    "we used the stellar kinematics derived by integral field spectroscopy of a sample of 18 sb  sd galaxies , observed with the ` sauron ` spectrograph .",
