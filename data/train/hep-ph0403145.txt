    "the quarks with six different flavours are grouped into the three doublets @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 , in one - to - one correspondence to the three lepton doublets @xmath4,@xmath5 , @xmath6 , as shown in the schematic chart in fig .",

    "quarks and leptons interact in a similar way with the electroweak vector bosons @xmath7,@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , it is anticipated that the universal higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the quark and lepton masses ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , quarks interact `` on their own '' , revealing their specific property , the colour charge ( _ colour _ ) , a conserved quantum number which is absent for leptons .",

    ", the massless and electroweakly - neutral spin-1 particles ,    in these lectures i will discuss the quark - gluon `` corner '' of the standard model , introducing the basics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of quark - gluon interactions . throughout this survey , the main emphasis will be put on the relation between qcd and _ hadrons _ , the observed bound states of quarks .",
    "this first lecture is devoted to the basic properties of the quark - gluon interactions .",
    "i will frequently refer to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the more familiar theory of electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "interactions , which is a useful prototype of qcd .    in fig .",

    "for definiteness , i specify the quarks as having @xmath10 and @xmath11 flavours , the counterparts of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the standard model .",
    "the two interactions have many important similarities :    * the colour - charged quarks emit and absorb gluons in the same way as the electrically charged leptons emit and absorb photons ; * gluon and photon are massless ; * both gluon and photon have spin 1 .    being guided by this analogy , one would expect that gluon exchanges generate a coulomb - type interquark force , similar to the usual attraction / repulsion between the electrically charged particles . in reality ,",
    "quark - gluon interactions are far more complicated .",
    "in particular , since the colour charge has three components , quarks can change their color states after emitting / absorbing gluons , as indicated on the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] .",
    "hence , due to the colour conservation , gluons also carry colour quantum numbers , and , as a result , interact with each other .",
    "in fact , it is the gluon self - interaction that makes qcd - dynamics so peculiar .",

    "both theories have specific `` internal '' symmetries , named _ local gauge symmetries _ , to be discussed below .",
    "the lepton - photon dynamics is described by one compact formula of the qed lagrangian , @xmath14 where the physical degrees of freedom of the photon field ( the electric and magnetic fields ) are combined in the field strength tensor @xmath15 , with @xmath16 . in the above",
    ", @xmath17 is the lepton dirac field with spin 1/2 and mass @xmath18 , and a compact notation for the covariant derivative @xmath19 is introduced . starting from @xmath20 it is possible to derive dirac equations for the leptons and maxwell equations for the photon .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ lqed ] ) yields the basics elements of the qed feynman diagrams : the photon and lepton propagators and the lepton - photon interaction vertex . employing these elements ,",
    "one obtains the amplitude of a given e.m .",
    "process in a form of a perturbative expansion in the numerically small coupling @xmath21 .",
    "for us the most interesting property of @xmath20 is the gauge symmetry which reveals itself if one locally changes the phase of the lepton fields : @xmath22\\psi_l(x)\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "if one simultaneously adds the derivative of the same function to the photon field : @xmath25 the lagrangian ( [ lqed ] ) remains invariant .",

    "current @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "importantly , the local gauge symmetry implies that the photon mass vanishes , @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , adding to @xmath20 a mass term @xmath29 for the photon field would evidently violate the symmetry because the latter term changes under ( [ u1a ] ) .",
    "the particular case @xmath30 ( when only the lepton fields are transformed ) corresponds to the _ global _ gauge symmetry which is responsible for the e.m .",

    "all three conditions are valid for the ( infinite and continuous ) set of transformations ( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ u1a ] ) generated by the set of the arbitrary functions @xmath23 . indeed , performing two gauge transformations one after the other , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "is equivalent to the gauge transformation with @xmath42 .",
    "the unit element of this `` multiplication '' rule is simply the transformation with @xmath43 and the inverse element for each @xmath23 is @xmath44 . importantly , the group multiplication is commutative ( the group is abelian ) because the result of the overlap of two phase transformations is independent of their order .",
    "the group we are discussing is called @xmath45 .",
    "mathematically , it is equivalent to the group of rotations of the cartesian coordinate system around one of its axes .",
    "the rotation angle plays the same role as the phase @xmath46 .",
    "gauge transformations in qcd have a more rich geometry .",
    "they are somewhat similar to the general rotations in the 3-dimensional space , involving @xmath47 matrices , which do not commute .",
    "more specifically , a colour gauge transformation of the quark field @xmath48 with a given flavour @xmath49 , involves transitions between different color components , a sort of `` rotations of colour coordinates '' : @xmath50 the elements of the @xmath51 matrix @xmath52 depend arbitrarily on the 4-point @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , this matrix is unitary : @xmath53 or , in a symbolic form , @xmath54 . to explain why unitarity is necessary ,",
    "let me invoke the following physical argument .",
    "since photon does not distinguish quark colours , the only admittable form for the e.m .",
    "interaction of quarks is @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath57 and the summation goes over the quark colour indices .",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ su3transf ] ) applied to the quark fields yields @xmath58 clearly , only if ( [ unit ] ) is valid , @xmath59 remains invariant .",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath70 defined in ( [ matrix ] ) obeys unitarity and has a unit determinant @xmath71 .",
    "the ( infinite and continuous ) set of noncommutative @xmath72 matrices forms a group , which is called @xmath73 .",
    "one may ask : why there are eight independent functions @xmath74 determining the rotations of the three color states ? is nt eight too many ?",
    "the point is that the quark fields @xmath75 are complex functions , hence the matrix @xmath70 is also a complex function of @xmath24 determined by @xmath76 real functions .",
    "only 8 of them are independent because there are altogether 10 constraints : nine provided by the unitarity relation ( [ unit ] ) and one by the unit determinant . with eight `` rotation angles '' the group @xmath73 is of course quite different from the group of rotations in three dimensions which has only 3 parameters .",
    "the qcd lagrangian has to be exactly symmetric with respect to the local gauge transformations ( [ su3transf ] ) with matrices ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "this property serves as a guiding principle for constructing @xmath77 .",
    "we start from the part of the lagrangian which describes the propagation of free quarks : @xmath78 and yields the usual dirac equation for spin 1/2 particle for each quark with a given flavour and colour .",
    "similar to the case of qed , the expression ( [ quarkl ] ) is not invariant with respect to the local gauge transformations ( [ su3transf ] ) .",

    "\\label{quarkp}\\ ] ] to restore gauge invariance one follows the same scenario as in qed or in the electroweak theory @xcite .",
    "the idea ( put forward long ago by yang and mills ) is to introduce `` compensating '' spin-1 fields interacting with quark fields .",
    "there should be one separate spin-1 field for each of the eight degrees of freedom determining the gauge transformations ( [ su3transf ] ) . in this way",
    "eight gluons enter the game , with the following quark - gluon interaction term added to the lagrangian : @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the dimensionless coupling analogous to @xmath12 in @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to e.m .",
    "interaction , where the photon field is electrically neutral , the gluon fields also carry colour charge , so that the colour state of a quark changes after emitting / absorbing a gluon .",
    "the colour of the gluon distinguished by the index @xmath82 can be identified with a superposition of quark and antiquark colours .",
    "for example the gluon field @xmath83 is in the same colour state as the quark - antiquark pair @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85-fields in ( [ lintqcd ] ) have to be gauge - transformed in the following way : @xmath86 so that the overall change of @xmath87 cancels the symmetry breaking term on r.h.s . of ( [ quarkp ] ) .",
    "it is a simple exercise to check that the combination of transformations ( [ su3transf ] ) and ( [ atransf ] ) leaves the sum @xmath88 invariant .",
    "we see that in qcd the `` compensating '' transformation of gluon fields ( [ atransf ] ) is more complicated than its analog ( [ u1a ] ) in qed : the addition of the derivative over @xmath46-functions is accompanied by a `` color rotation '' .    to complete",
    "the lagrangian one has to add a gauge - invariant term describing the propagation of gluon fields : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the gluon field - strength tensor .",
    "the local gauge invariance of @xmath91 implies that gluons are massless . at the same time",
    ", @xmath92 is a more complicated object than its qed analog @xmath27 . indeed , substituting ( [ gmunu ] ) to ( [ gluel ] ) , we notice that not only the terms quadratic in @xmath85 emerge ( propagation of gluons ) but also the three- and four - gluon vertices ( gluon self - interactions ) . note that formally , both properties of gluons : colour quantum number and self - interactions are due to the noncommutativity of the gauge - transformation group ( the fact that @xmath93 ) . the final form of qcd lagrangian",
    "is obtained by adding together the three pieces introduced above : @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "to summarize , @xmath77 describes not only quark - gluon interactions but also _ gluodynamics _ , the specific gluon self - interactions which have no analog in qed .",
    "quantum correction ( when photons exchange virtual electrons via box diagrams ) . for a classical maxwellian electrodynamics , self - interacting e.m .",
    "fields would mean `` new physics beyond standard theory '' .",
    "i am not aware of any discussions of photon self - interactions in the times before quantum field theory .",
    "interestingly , the light emitting light was mentioned in poetry .",
    "i found the following sentence written in xiii century by armenian poet kostandin erznkazi @xcite : `` and so the light was born from the light , the great light of sun ... '' ( in translation from armenian ) ]    the quark and gluon propagators and vertices derived from @xmath77 are collected in table 1 .",
    "the formula of the gluon propagator has a certain degree of freedom related to the fact that the physical massless gluon has only two polarization / spin states whereas the field @xmath85 has four components . to make things working ,",
    "one follows the same recipe as in qed .",
    "an additional constraint on the gluon field is introduced , the so called gauge - fixing condition .",
    "the gluon propagator given in table  [ tab : fr ] corresponds to the usual feynman gauge .",
    "note that in qcd purely gluonic loop diagrams are possible , in which case one has to take care of subtracting the contributions of unphysical components of @xmath85 also in these loops .",
    "it is usually done by adding specially designed fictitious particles ( the so called fadeev - popov ghosts ) which only appear in the loops , and are not shown in table 1 .",

    "the flavour partners of the pion ( @xmath98-meson ) with @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) are listed in table  [ tab : mesons ] .",
    "almost all of them have been observed ; the masses and other characteristics are given in @xcite .",
    "the only temporary exceptions are the pseudoscalar @xmath101 meson ( @xmath102 ) and the vector @xmath103 meson ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "these two states are not yet in @xcite , due mainly to experimental reasons .    the _ heavy quarkonia _ , i.e. , the mesons consisting of heavy quark and antiquark ( @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) are of a special interest . here",
    "the masses of interacting quarks are large enough compared to their characteristic energies within hadrons : @xmath107 . in other words ,",
    "heavy quarks are nonrelativistic objects with respect to qcd interactions .",
    "it is therefore possible to approximate the quark - gluon interactions with a nonrelativistic potential , putting the hadronic calculus on the safe ground of quantum mechanics .",
    "the coulomb quark - antiquark potential @xmath108 , derived from the one - gluon exchange , is valid at small distances . to provide quark confinement ,",
    "a certain long - distance part of the potential , infinitely growing at @xmath109 should also exist ( e.g. , oscillator or linear potential ) .",
    "this part of the potential can not be directly calculated from @xmath77 and is usually modeled and fitted to the observed quarkonium spectra .",
    "importantly , numerical studies of qcd on the lattice confirm the existence of the confining potential force between heavy quark and antiquark .",
    "in addition to the exact colour- and space - time symmetries , qcd lagrangian possesses approximate flavour symmetries originating from the pattern of quark masses . since the latter",
    "are generated by some external mechanism , the flavour symmetries do not have fundamental roots in qcd .",
    "nevertheless , they provide very important relations for hadron masses and hadronic amplitudes .",
    "let us start with the @xmath110 and @xmath10 quarks and rewrite the qcd lagrangian , isolating these two flavours : @xmath111 the smallness of the @xmath110 and @xmath10 masses , @xmath112 , implies that also their difference is small : @xmath113 neglecting this difference we use a new notation for the common @xmath114 quark mass : @xmath115 in this approximation , @xmath116 where a new , two - component spinor field ( doublet ) is introduced : @xmath117 the theory described by the r.h.s . of ( [ qcdisosp ] )",
    "is not exactly qcd , but is very close to it .",
    "the new lagrangian @xmath118 contains two degenerate quark flavours and has a symmetry with respect to the general phase rotations in the `` two - flavour space '' : @xmath119 where @xmath120 are arbitrary ( @xmath24-independent ) parameters and @xmath121 are the @xmath122 pauli matrices .",
    "the symmetry transformations ( [ su2transf ] ) form a group su(2 ) . 2 matrix with the unit determinant . ]",
    "one has to emphasize that the approximate su(2)-flavour symmetry emerges `` by chance '' , simply because the @xmath110 and @xmath10 quark masses turn out to be almost degenerate . note also that e.m .",
    "interaction violates this symmetry , due to different electric charges of @xmath110 and @xmath10 quarks .",
    "but this @xmath123 effect is again small , at the same level of @xmath124 , as the @xmath125 violation due to the quark mass difference .",
    "the approximate degeneracy of @xmath110 and @xmath10 flavours manifests itself in hadrons . replacing @xmath110 quarks by @xmath10 quarks or vice versa in a given hadron , yields a different hadron which has a very close mass and other properties .",
    "this qualitative prediction is nicely confirmed by the measured mass differences between proton ( @xmath126 ) and neutron ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath128 and @xmath129/\\sqrt{2})$ ] , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , etc .. the typical mass splittings for the @xmath132 hadronic partners are at the level of few mev .",
    "thus , qcd nicely explains the origin of _ isospin _ symmetry introduced by heisenberg in 30 s in nuclear physics , to describe the similarities between the `` mirror '' isotopes , obtained from each other by interchanging protons and neutrons .",
    "the second part in the word isospin reflects the analogy with the electron spin symmetry , the degeneracy of the spin - up and spin - down electron states in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , one introduces a similar formalism in qcd , attributing isospin @xmath133   to the doublet of @xmath110 and @xmath10 quarks and treating these two flavours as `` up '' and `` down '' components with @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "the hadrons containing @xmath110 and @xmath10 quarks in different combinations form isomultiplets , with the isospin counting similar to the spin algebra in quantum mechanics . in the case of proton and neutron ,",
    "the diquark @xmath136 has isospin 0 , therefore , adding @xmath110 or @xmath10 quark to the diquark , we get the nucleon isodoublet ( @xmath133 ) consisting of proton with @xmath134 and neutron with @xmath135 .",
    "another isodoublet is formed by @xmath137 and @xmath138 , where @xmath139 quark , which has no isospin , is combined with @xmath110 and @xmath10 , respectively . in the same way ,",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath141 , or @xmath142 and @xmath143 build isodoublets .    note that antiquarks have the opposite signs of @xmath144 : @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) has @xmath135 ( @xmath134 ) . combining @xmath110 and @xmath10 quark with their antiquarks ,",
    "one gets four states .",
    "three of them belong to isotriplet ( @xmath147 ) : @xmath148 for example , pions ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , as well as @xmath98 mesons ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) form isotriplets .",
    "the fourth quark - antiquark state is an isosinglet ( @xmath155 ) : @xmath156 which deserves a separate discussion . in general , the @xmath157 and @xmath158 states transform into each other via intermediate gluons . in mesons",
    "this transition takes place at long distances , due to some nonperturbative mechanism , not necessarily described by diagrams with a fixed number of gluons . in any case",
    ", the transition amplitude has a characteristic scale of @xmath159 , much larger than the mass difference @xmath160 between the @xmath157 and @xmath158 states .",
    "the @xmath161 degeneracy yields two orthogonal physical states , the @xmath162 component of the isotriplet ( [ isotriplet ] ) and the isosinglet ( [ iso0 ] ) . turning to strange quarks",
    "one encounters the second @xmath155 state @xmath163 .",
    "the same gluonic transition mechanism provides a mixing between ( [ iso0 ] ) and the @xmath163-state , now , the difference between the masses is not small , being of @xmath164 .",
    "hence , the amount of mixing depends on the magnitude of the @xmath165 transition amplitude .",
    "the latter is quite sensitive to the spin - parity of the meson state .",
    "for example , the two isosinglet mesons with @xmath99 shown in table  [ tab : mesons ] have ( up to small deviations ) the following quark content : @xmath166 indicating that mixing in the @xmath167 channel is large .",
    "for the @xmath100 mesons the situation is completely different . from the quark content of the isosinglet",
    "mesons : @xmath168 one concludes that the transition from strange to nonstrange quark pairs in the @xmath169 state is suppressed .",
    "returning to the isospin symmetry , it is worth to mention that it yields useful relations between hadronic amplitudes . to give just one simple example ,",
    "let us consider the four observable hadronic decays of @xmath170 -meson .",
    "the amplitudes of these decays are related via isospin symmetry , so that only one amplitude is independent : @xmath171 to obtain these relations , one does not necessarily need to apply formulae for su(2 ) group . in the isospin limit , all four decays are described by a single quark diagram , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : kstkpi ] , where the initial and final mesons are taken in the valence - quark state .",
    "hadronic decays ; the four possible combinations of @xmath172 and @xmath173 correspond to the four decay modes related by isospin symmetry._,width=302 ]    each individual decay mode has its own combination of @xmath110 and @xmath10 quarks to be substituted in this diagram .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients @xmath174 originate from the quark content of @xmath150 . naturally , the hadronic amplitude attributed to the quark diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : kstkpi ] is a nonperturbative , long - distance object and can not be directly calculated in qcd .",
    "however all we need are the amplitude relations between individual decay modes and not the value of the amplitude itself . squaring the relations ( [ su2rel ] ) and taking into account the phase space ,",
    "one predicts the ratios of branching fractions confirmed by the experimental values given in @xcite .",
    "another flavour symmetry , widely used in hadron phenomenology , is @xmath175 corresponding to the limit of qcd with all three quarks , @xmath110,@xmath10 and @xmath11 , having equal masses . since in reality",
    "@xmath176 is only inessentially smaller than @xmath177 , the magnitude of @xmath175-violation in hadrons is not universal , depending on their quark content and quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath175 symmetry is very helpful in `` organizing '' the spectra of strange and nonstrange hadrons in multiplets .",
    "the light - quark meson multiplets are obtained by combining quark flavour - triplets and antiquark flavour - antitriplets . without using the specific rules of @xmath73-algebra , which can be found in many textbooks , it is easy to figure out that the nine quark - antiquark states split into a singlet @xmath184 and octet @xmath185 .",
    "the octet has its own isospin substructure .",
    "is a subgroup of @xmath175 . ]",
    "the singlet - octet pattern provides a reasonable description for pseudoscalar mesons , in particular , @xmath186 meson is close to the @xmath175 singlet state ( [ etaprime ] ) .",

    "however , this pattern is not universal .",
    "e.g. , in the case of vector mesons , @xmath191 and @xmath192 states in ( [ omega ] ) are neither octets , nor singlets . to complete the counting of meson @xmath175 multiplets",
    ", one has to mention also triplets and antitriplets of heavy - light mesons .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath193 quark , @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) form a triplet ( antitriplet ) .    generally , @xmath175 works quite well for baryons , because their characteristic mass scale is a few times larger than @xmath177 .",
    "importantly , the spin - parity of the lowest baryon @xmath175 multiplets is fixed , due to the total antisymmetry of the baryon `` wave - function '' in the @xmath175/spin / colour coordinates required by fermi - statistics .",

    "the fact that @xmath217 , together with the flavour - independence of quark - gluon interactions , allows one to consider an interesting limit of @xmath77 where both @xmath193 and @xmath218 quarks have infinitely heavy mass : @xmath219 at first sight , the limit is not justified , because in reality @xmath220 is substantially larger than @xmath221 . as we shall see , the fact that both masses are large turns out to be more important for qcd dynamics .",

    "the situation very much resembles the hydrogen atom where the total mass of the atom is a sum of an extremely large ( @xmath232 gev ) proton mass and a small energy of the electron cloud ( @xmath233 mev ) .",
    "the essential point is that the electron itself is nonrelativistic .",
    "one can isolate the electron mass from the rest of the energy , introduce the coulomb potential and kinetic energy , and eventually solve the equations of motion , determining the electron energy levels . in heavy hadrons",
    "the light - quark cloud is purely relativistic ( @xmath234 ) and has a complicated long - distance nature .",
    "nevertheless , one essential feature is common for both bound states . in the atom the energy of the electron cloud",
    "does not depend on the proton mass .",
    "likewise , in the heavy - light meson @xmath231 in ( [ massh ] ) is ( up to @xmath235 corrections ) independent of @xmath225 . from atomic physics we know that the electron energy levels in hydrogen and deuterium coincide to a great precision .",
    "the fact that deuteron is twice more massive than proton , does not play a role for the energy levels , because in both cases the atomic nuclei are static .",
    "important is that the electric charge does not change by switching from proton to deuteron .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath228 meson @xmath231 changes very little if one replaces @xmath225 by @xmath220 or by @xmath221 , because the colour charge of the heavy quark does not change .",
    "thus , the heavy - flavour symmetry is in reality the symmetry between the light - quark remnants of the heavy hadrons , so that the heavy - quark mass scale indeed plays a secondary role .    to achieve a quantitative level , a special formalism of _ heavy quark effective theory _ ( hqet ) was developed for applications of qcd to heavy - light hadrons .",
    "one starts from @xmath77 and introduces transformations which decouple the @xmath236 part of the heavy - quark field from the part which has the remnant momentum @xmath237 .",
    "only the latter part strongly interacting with the light quark - gluon cloud is relevant for qcd dynamics . in hqet one",
    "integrates out the heavy degrees of freedom and works with the lagrangian containing a new effective quark field carrying the flavour of @xmath238 but no mass .",
    "not only the static limit ( [ hlimit ] ) but also an expansion in powers of @xmath235 can be systematically treated .",
    "the field - theoretical aspects of heavy - mass expansion are nicely explained in the literature ( see e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) ; i will only focus on some important phenomenological consequences of heavy - flavour symmetry .",
    "one famous example is the @xmath239 decay involving weak @xmath240 transition in standard model .",
    "the unknown part of the decay amplitude is the hadronic matrix element @xmath241 determined by the long - distance interactions involving the initial and final heavy quarks as well as the surrounding light quark - gluon `` cloud '' .",
    "one chooses a special kinematical configuration , the `` zero recoil point '' where the momentum transfer to the lepton pair is equal to @xmath242 in the @xmath227 meson rest system @xmath243 this point correspond to the final @xmath226 meson at rest . in the heavy - quark limit",
    "the replacement of @xmath218 quark by @xmath193-quark does not change the hadronic state : @xmath244 and the matrix element ( [ zerorec ] ) reduces to a trivial normalization factor .",
    "one can therefore predict the decay amplitude in the zero recoil point up to @xmath235 corrections .",
    "in fact there is a theorem stating that these corrections are even smaller and start from @xmath245 , but to derive this and other important details one needs a full - scale hqet framework .    without resorting to the effective theory ,",
    "it is possible to understand the origin of another important symmetry emerging in the heavy - quark limit . in the hydrogen atom ,",
    "the electron and proton have magnetic moments related to their spins and yielding interactions with the external magnetic fields or with each other ( spin - spin interactions ) .",
    "the magnetic moments are inversely proportional to the masses , so that the proton magnetic moment plays no role for the electron energy levels . each level is degenerate with respect to the proton spin direction .",
    "since qed and qcd have very similar vector boson interactions with spin 1/2 particles , the spin @xmath246 quarks also have _ chromomagnetic _ moments . and interact with the `` magnetic '' parts of gluonic fields and with other quarks . for the heavy nonrelativistic quark the chromomagnetic moment is inversely proportional to the heavy quark mass @xmath225 . in the infinite mass limit the interaction vanishes and ,",
    "hence the light - cloud energy @xmath231 is independent of the spin orientation of the heavy quark .",
    "one arrives at a new classification of heavy - light states based on this _ heavy - quark spin symmetry_. instead of adding together the orbital momentum and the total spin of quarks as we did in ( [ spin ] ) it is more appropriate to introduce , for a @xmath247 meson ( @xmath248 ; @xmath249 ) , the total angular momentum of light degrees of freedom : @xmath250 adding the heavy quark spin @xmath251 to @xmath252 one gets degenerate doublets of heavy - light mesons with total angular momentum @xmath253 . at @xmath254",
    "one simply has @xmath255 and therefore a doublet of mesons with @xmath100 and @xmath99 consisting of @xmath227 and @xmath256 ( @xmath226 and @xmath257 ) in the @xmath218 quark ( charm ) sector .",
    "the mass differences within doublets are indeed very small @xcite : @xmath258 indicating that the heavy - quark spin symmetry works quite well , especially for the heavier @xmath218 quark .",
    "taking into account that the mass differences are @xmath259 effects , one expects that @xmath260 which is also in accordance with ( [ diffm ] ) and ( [ qmasses ] ) .",
    "i leave as an exercise to show that at @xmath261 there are two degenerate doublets : one with @xmath262 and another one with @xmath263",
    ".      the colour confinement principle does not exclude hadronic states with an `` exotic '' valence quark content , different from @xmath264 or @xmath265 .",
    "quarks , antiquarks and gluons can be added together in any combination , e.g. , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 or @xmath269 , provided they are in a colour - neutral state . since one can not calculate the spectrum of hadrons in qcd with a good precision , predictions of exotic states are generally model - dependent .",
    "it is always problematic to distinguish an exotic hadron from the excitation of an ordinary hadron with the same @xmath97 and flavour quantum numbers .",
    "moreover , in this case one expects mixing between ordinary and exotic hadrons .",
    "for example , if there is a @xmath99 state composed of two gluons @xmath267 ( _ glueball _ ) , it should be mixed with @xmath186 to a certain degree , so that @xmath186 acquires a glueball component .    therefore , the most interesting , `` smoking gun '' signatures are the hadrons with exotic quantum numbers ( flavour content and/or @xmath270 ) , forbidden for quark - antiquark mesons or three - quark baryons . for example",
    "it is impossible to arrange a flavour - neutral quark - antiquark state with @xmath271 . the @xmath272 and @xmath273 ( charge - conjugation ) parities of a fermion - antifermion state are determined by the rules : @xmath274 and @xmath275 , so that @xmath276 means @xmath277 .",
    "hence , the only possibility to have @xmath278 is @xmath279 .",
    "however , adding together even values of @xmath280 and @xmath281 one can not get @xmath282 . on the other hand ,",
    "adding one constituent gluon to a @xmath264 pair , one easily makes a `` hybrid '' meson with @xmath283 content and @xmath271 quantum numbers .",
    "searches for hybrid mesons are currently being carried out , but the experimental situation is not yet settled .",
    "the recently observed narrow baryon resonance @xmath284 decaying to @xmath285@xcite is another promising candidate for hadron exotics , a state @xmath286 with five valence constituents ( _ pentaquark _ ) .",
    "flavour symmetries are important model - independent tools to confirm / reject the experimental candidates for exotic resonances . in particular , an important task is to find the symmetry partners of these hadrons and to fill the relevant isospin and @xmath175 multiplets ( in case of the pentaquark it is actually the @xmath175 antidecouplet ) .",
    "in this lecture we return to the quark - gluon interactions at large momentum transfers ( short distances ) . in this region , practically at @xmath287 gev , @xmath288 is small , allowing one to apply the perturbative expansion .",
    "it is then possible to test qcd quantitatively , calculating various quark - gluon interaction processes at large @xmath238 and comparing the results with the available experimental data .",
    "note however , that the traditional way to study interactions by scattering one object on the other is not applicable to quarks and gluons .",
    "they simply are not available in free - particle states .",
    "one needs to trace quarks inside hadrons , where the long - distance forces are important .",
    "take as an example the elastic pion - proton scattering at large momentum transfers ( see fig .  [ fig : pin ] ) .",
    "here one has to combine the perturbative quark - quark scattering amplitudes ( two - gluon exchange ) with the `` wave functions '' of quarks inside the initial and final hadrons . to obtain these functions one needs to go beyond perturbative qcd",
    "therefore , an unambiguous extraction of the perturbative amplitude from the data on the scattering cross section is not a realistic task .",
    "the situation is not so hopeless , actually , since we have at our disposal electroweak bosons ( @xmath289 ) interacting with quarks in a pointlike way .",
    "electroweak interactions at large momentum transfer serve as external probes of short - distance dynamics . in lecture 1 , we already discussed one example : the quark - antiquark pair production in @xmath9 decay . to list all possible electroweak sources of quarks in a more systematic way , i start with the photon .",

    "due to asymptotic freedom of qcd , gluonic interactions of the produced quark pair are suppressed by small @xmath288 .",
    "hence , @xmath297 annihilation at high energies provides an almost pointlike source of quasi - free quark pairs . at long distances",
    "the created quarks and antiquarks are inevitably converted into some hadronic state . since in the total cross section the summation",
