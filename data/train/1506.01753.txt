    "wideband spectrum sensing , which consists of observing a wideband and identifying the portions that are occupied and those which are free , is essential in interweave cognitive radio networks [ 1 ] . in these networks , unlicensed or secondary users ( sus ) are prohibited from accessing an occupied band by the primary user ( pu ) .",
    "the su has to vacate the band and search for another unoccupied band if the pu appears , thus wideband sensing is a must .",
    "one of the main approaches to realize wideband sensing is to assume the feasibility of sampling the desired spectrum by the ordinary nyquist rate [ 2 ] . practically , high computational complexity and power consumption attached to the required ultra high sampling rates and high analogue to digital converter ( adc ) resolutions can be relaxed if the sensing performance is acceptable with ultra low precision adcs ( 1 - 3 bits ) [ 3 ] .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a wideband spectrum sensing system in which a 1-bit adc is employed .",
    "in fact , among all other adcs , a 1-bit adc consumes the minimum power for a given sampling frequency .",
    "current commercially available high - resolution high - speed adcs consume power on the order of several watts .",
    "for example , the recent 12-bit adc 12d1600qml - sp from texas instruments can process 3.2gsamples / sec at a power consumption of 3.88watts . on the other hand , a single high speed comparator ( 1-bit adc ) with the same operating frequency is designed to dissipate 20@xmath0watts [ 4 ] .",
    "further , the complexity is extremely reduced as automatic gain control is not required for these systems .",
    "also the hardware complexity for the digital signal processing modules including the fast fourier transform ( fft ) engine and the power detector will be significantly reduced due to the minimized bit - width for various building blocks .",
    "for instance , the fft module will not involve any multiplications and only additions / subtractions are required .",
    "motivated by the above , we present a complete architecture for the sensing engine .",
    "irrespective of the sensing period being long , the system performance for both non - quantized and 1-bit quantized systems is modelled analytically and evaluated by simulations .",
    "consider a cr system operating over a wideband channel divided into @xmath1 non - overlapping sub - bands .",
    "conventionally , it is assumed that the sub - bands have equal - size bandwidths @xmath2 [ 5 ] . at the cr receiver",
    ", the signal is sampled at the nyquist sampling rate @xmath3 .",
    "the received signal in the frequency domain can be represented by the @xmath4 vector given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the number of active primary signals that randomly occupy @xmath6 sub - bands and @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a diagonal @xmath9 channel matrix , @xmath10 is the spectrum of the @xmath11th primary signal over the @xmath11th sub - band , and @xmath12 is frequency domain independent and identically distributed circularly - symmetric additive white gaussian noise with zero - mean and variance @xmath13=n\\sigma^2_w$ ] , where @xmath14 denotes expectation .",
    "similar to [ 6 ] , it is assumed that the distribution of the received primary signal over a single sub - band is also circularly - symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) with zero - mean and variance @xmath15 .",
    "this assumption holds when primary radios deploy uniform power transmission strategies given no channel knowledge at the transmitter side [ 2 ] . that is the total power over the entire band is @xmath16\\,=\\,m\\sigma^2_s+n\\sigma^2_w$ ] where all interferers and the noise are assumed to be statistically independent",
    "finally , the channel is assumed to be static over the sensing interval .",
    "the architecture for the proposed one - bit quantized system is shown by fig .  [",
    "fig : onebitquantizerrssi ] . after the rf direct conversion processing",
    ", the baseband signal is sampled through a 1-bit quantizer to retrieve the sign from the sample value .",
    "a high speed buffer is employed to store one window of captured samples , precisely @xmath17 samples .",
    "the samples are segmented into non - overlapped captures where each capture has exactly @xmath1 samples .",
    "current rf processors fortunately provide the received signal power that is measured by a received signal strength indicator ( rssi ) block [ 7 ] .",
    "the measured value is reported to the digital processor through a stand - alone high resolution adc that operates at relatively low sampling rate , @xmath18 . in this work ,",
    "each capture is processed by the fft block to obtain the frequency spectrum over @xmath1 frequency pins where each pin corresponds to a single sub - band .",
    "the frequency transformation and scaling can be defined by , @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the capture index , @xmath21 is the sub - band index such that @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the measured signal power , and @xmath24 is an integer representing the window index over time . according to our model",
    ", the measured power value corresponds to @xmath25 . for each frequency pin @xmath21 and window index @xmath24",
    ", the energy contained in one window consisting of @xmath26 samples can be defined by @xmath27 as given by ( [ equ : decisionstatistic ] ) .",
    "hence , the decision statistic , @xmath28 , is defined to be a simple power estimator that is employed to decide whether this sub - band is a hole or not .",
    "for a large number of samples to average , the central - limit theorem is typically employed to approximate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the decision statistic @xmath30 as a normal distribution under both hypothesises [ 6 ] . in this section ,",
    "we provide exact closed - form expressions for the sensing performance independently on the averaging depth by considering first the non - quantized system .",
    "next , the effect of the 1-bit adc is demonstrated by evaluating the amount of noise power added to the frequency spectrum for both hypothesises .      for each sub - band , @xmath21",
    ", we wish to discriminate between the two hypotheses @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the first assumes that the primary signal is not in band and the second assumes that the primary user is present . using the average energy decision statistic , one can define these hypotheses under the assumption of infinite adc precision as given by ( [ equ : binaryhypotheses ] ) .",
    "@xmath33    as the wideband sensing objective is to explore the spectral occupancy of primary signals over numerous number of sub - bands ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) , the fft output sequence follows a cscg distribution by the central - limit theorem .",
    "let @xmath35 , the random variable @xmath27 follows a chi - square distribution with @xmath26 degrees of freedom [ 8 ] . by applying a linear transformation between random variables , one can obtain the pdf for the decision statistic as given by ( [ equ : energydistributionforz ] ) where @xmath36 .",
    "further , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) can be obtained in a closed - form as given by ( [ equ : energydistributioncdf ] ) .",
    "@xmath37    the quality of the detector is described by the receiver - operating - characteristics ( roc ) which represent the probability of detection , @xmath38 , and the probability of false alarm , @xmath39 , that are defined as the probabilities that the sensing algorithm detects a primary user under hypotheses @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . by varying a certain threshold @xmath42 for each sub - band @xmath21 ,",
    "the operating point of a detector can be chosen anywhere along the roc curve . @xmath39 and @xmath38 can be defined as given by ( [ equ : pfadefinition ] ) and ( [ equ : pddefinition ] ) , respectively .",

    "n l/(\\sigma_w ^2+\\sigma_s ^2)}\\label{equ : pddefinition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in conventional systems that consider the quantization effect [ 9 ] , the effect is modelled by adding one more term to the signal variance representing the quantization noise power which is a function of the adc resolution . unfortunately , this procedure can not be applied for the 1-bit quantizer case since the adc aggressively saturates the incoming signal to two possible outcomes @xmath44 that are uniformly distributed .    by introducing the power scaling operation after the fft module ,",
    "a total power transfer is guaranteed to the frequency domain since the defined transform itself is linear and unitary . however , the main objective of the transformation is to reshape the power across various sub - bands .",
    "if the input is left un - quantized , the information required for this redistribution process is known in full and the detection error is only introduced due to the noisy environment .",
    "when the input is quantized to a single bit and no power gain or loss is guaranteed , then simply the quantization effect can be interpreted as a power leakage process due to the reduced amount of information about the power distribution .",
    "let @xmath45 be the amount of leakage to all sub - bands where @xmath46 is a constant .",
    "since the occupied sub - bands are uniformly distributed across the whole band , the leakage will also be uniformly distributed across all sub - bands .",
    "then , the power contained by one sub - band under @xmath41 would be @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the snr over one sub - band .",
    "one part of the leaked power is distributed over the vacant sub - bands while the remaining part is added to the occupied sub - bands themselves .",
    "thus , one can write the power contained in one occupied sub - band as @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the contribution of this sub - band in the total leakage power . in this work ,",
    "we rely on extensive computer simulations by varying @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath6 , @xmath26 , and @xmath1 to find an optimum estimate for this constant which is found to be @xmath53 .",
    "and @xmath54    in the simulation , we consider a wideband system that employs a total band of @xmath55mhz which is divided into @xmath56 non - overlapped sub - bands , @xmath6 of which are occupied by primary signals .",
    "each of those allocated sub - bands carries qam signal that is passed over a blocking fading channel filter . to simulate the system behaviour ,",
    "@xmath57 trials are processed and the system performance is evaluated based on the decision outcomes . in each trial ,",
    "a single window is generated where the sub - band occupancies are never changed within a single window .",
    "the signs of the received samples are captured to be processed by the detector .",
    "first , the approximated roc proposed by [ 6 ] is compared to our exact closed - form roc performance under different snr values and for relatively high averaging rate ( e.g , @xmath58 ) .",
    "the performance curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rocunquannormalquancompare2mod ] .",
    "it is clear that the normal approximation introduces considerably large errors in performance even for relatively high averaging rate .",

    "more than 100 false alarm rates are simulated and different snr values are considered .",
    "[ fig : detectiondiffmsnr0quan2mod ] shows the exact match of the performance between the simulation and the analysis for all possible spectrum utilization ratios and for countable number of false alarm rates . although these results assume fixed values for other parameters such as @xmath59 and snr=0db , we rely on other results ( in fig .
