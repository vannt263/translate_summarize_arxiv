    "the solar system , for a long time , has been the only source of information about the fluorine abundance in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical origin of solar system s fluorine is not yet identified from the known theories of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the major problem with fluorine production is that , the element has only one stable , yet rather fragile , isotope , @xmath0f . in stellar interiors",
    "it is readily destroyed by hydrogen via @xmath0f(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o and helium via @xmath0f(@xmath1,p)@xmath3ne .",
    "the high f abundances which were measured , using infrared hf vibration - rotation transitions , in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars from the @xcite sample , provided clues for fluorine production in agb stars . the @xcite study measured f abundances in different populations : in galactic red giants ( a subset of jorissen et al . sample ) , in red giants in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , as well as in a few stars in the globular cluster omega centauri .",
    "concerning @xmath4cen , the f abundances found in that study were quite low .",
    "one possible interpretation was that the agb stars in @xmath4cen did not contribute significantly to the fluorine .",
    "however , this conclusion assumes that there has been effective agb pollution in @xmath4cen .",
    "apart from the third dredge - up of agb stars , the other two sources of fluorine are typeii supernovae ( sne ) explosions , and stellar winds from wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars .",
    "@xcite showed that in typeii sne , @xmath0f can be created by spallation of @xmath5ne by neutrinos . in massive or w - r stars ,",
    "@xmath0f is probably produced during he - burning phase and , before it gets annihilated , is ejected into space by strong stellar winds @xcite . in agb stars @xmath0f",
    "is predicted to be produced in the convective he - rich intershell and then dredged - up to the surface during the he - burning thermal pulses @xcite .",
    "the reaction chain for f production in the he - burning environments of agb and w - r stars is : @xmath6n(@xmath1,@xmath7)@xmath8f(@xmath9)@xmath8o(p,@xmath1)@xmath10n(@xmath1,@xmath7)@xmath0f .",
    "protons are provided by the @xmath6n(n , p)@xmath6c reaction with neutrons liberated from @xmath11c(@xmath1,n)@xmath2o .",
    "the @xmath6n and @xmath11c nuclei are the result of h - burning by cno cycling , and the initial @xmath11c stock acts as a limiting factor for the @xmath0f yield .",
    "the cunha et al.s same fluorine abundance results for the milky way were later discussed in @xcite in light of a chemical evolution model for the galaxy that took into account all possible sources for fluorine production .",
    "this chemical evolution model , however , can not be applied to the peculiar globular cluster @xmath4cen and the low fluorine abundance results for @xmath4cen remain puzzling .",
    "renda et al . suggest that both w - r and agb stars are significant sources of fluorine , and that is supported by the evidence of enhanced f abundance from fv and fvi absorption lines in the far - uv spectra of hot post - agb pg1159 stars @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite determine f abundances from the nebular emission lines : [ fii ] line at 4789  and [ fiv ] line at 4060 , for a sample of planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "fluorine is abundant in pne , and this provides evidence for the synthesis of fluorine in the agb phase .",
    "no evidence of enhanced fluorine resulting from spallation in typeii sne is suggested by the observations of fi interstellar absorption line at 955  in two sight lines towards the cep ob2 association using @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xcite",
    ".    extreme helium ( ehe ) stars , see for @xcite and the references therein , are suggested to have gone through agb phase in their earlier evolution , hence , fluorine should be present in their atmospheres .",
    "presence of fluorine in ehe s atmosphere can serve as a test bed for fluorine production in agb stars . in this letter , we present fluorine abundances for the sample of cool ehe stars from fi lines .",
    "high - resolution optical spectra of four cool ehes : fqaqr , lsiv-14@xmath16109 , bd-1@xmath163438 , and lsiv-1@xmath162 , were obtained at the w. j. mcdonald observatory s 2.7-m telescope with the coud cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph @xcite at a 2-pixel resolving power ( r = @xmath17 ) of 60,000 .",
    "the details of these observations are described in @xcite .",
    "the observations of the cool ehe lss3378 , described in @xcite , were acquired at ctio .    finally , spectra of hd168476 @xmath18 pvtel , the coolest member of the hot ehe stars , were obtained with the vainu bappu telescope ( vbt ) of the indian institute of astrophysics with a fiber - fed cross - dispersed echelle spectrometer @xcite .",
    "these spectra with a resolving power of about 30,000 were recorded on a 2048 @xmath19 4096 pixels ccd camera exclusively built for the spectrometer . the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) per pixel of the final co - added spectrum , from the exposures obtained on 2006 april 22 and 2006 may 15 , is @xmath2040 at about 6902 .",
    "in addition , mcdonald spectra of hr2074 , a normal a0 ia - type supergiant , and ksper , a h - deficient hot primary of a spectroscopic binary , were available for examination .",
    "the telluric absorption lines from the spectra of the programme stars were removed interactively using early - type rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we have used the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software packages to reduce the spectra , and the task @xmath21 within iraf to remove the telluric absorption lines . in figure 1 , the telluric absorption lines from the spectrum of the cool ehe lss3378 are not removed just to show their presence .",
    "the multiplets numbered 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 by @xcite are potential contributors of fi absorption lines to cool ehe stars spectra .",
    "complete listings of the wavelengths for lines of these multiplets from the 3@xmath22 ",
    "3@xmath23 transition array were compiled from the nist database .",
    "measured @xmath24-values were taken from @xcite who show that their results are in fair agreement not only with the semiempirical calculations of @xcite but also with earlier experimental determinations ; the latter on a relative scale .",
    "table 1 gives a partial list of these multiplets ; lines of very small @xmath24-value are omitted on the ground that their fi contribution must be very small .",
    "+ fi lines from @xmath25(@xmath26p)@xmath27  @xmath25(@xmath26p)@xmath28 transition array detected in the spectra of the analysed stars .",
    "the fi lines used in abundance determination for all the analysed cool ehes are shown in bold +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     eleven fi lines were identified as the principal or leading contributor to a stellar line - see table 1 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the window from 6900  to 6928  that represents a couple of fi lines at 6902.46 , and 6909.82 , where the cool ehe stars are ordered from top to bottom in order of decreasing effective temperature .",
    "all spectra are alligned to the rest wavelengths of the well known lines , that fall in the wavelength regions . at the bottom",
    ", ksper is added , which is known to be h - deficient @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of ksper very much resembles the spectrum of the cool ehe lsiv-14@xmath16109 , except for the ci lines which are extremely week or not present in the ksper s spectrum @xcite .",
    "singly ionized metal lines ( particularly feii ) are identified as contributor to a stellar line at or about fi lines in ksper s spectrum .",
    "note the presence of almost no lines in the ksper s spectrum at or about some contributing fi lines in cool ehes spectra ( figure 1 ) .",
    "only these fi lines , if not blended by ci lines , are identified as the sole major contributor to a stellar line in a cool ehe s spectrum .",
    "the pattern to be contrasted is , for example , the ci and fi lines show little variation in these cool ehe stars when compared to the metal lines ( e.g. , feii ) that show a considerable star to star variation ( figure 1 ) . finally , the spectrum of hr2074 , a normal a0 ia - type supergiant is shown at the top .",
    "lines of all elements expected and observed in the spectrum of a normal a0 ia - type supergiant were found .",
    "lines of ionized metals of the iron group are plentiful .",
    "these lines are much stronger when compared with those observed in hr2074 , a notable feature of the spectra of cool ehe stars and ksper , and attributable to the lower opacity in the atmosphere due to hydrogen deficiency .    for all fi lines",
    ", an attempt was made to conduct a thorough search for blending lines .",
    "databases examined included the kurucz s database , tables of spectra of h , c , n , and o @xcite , selected tables of atomic spectra of si @xcite , the nist database , and the new fei multiplet table @xcite .",
    "these provided not only wavelengths of potential blends but also estimates of a line s @xmath24-value .",
    "the spectrum of supergiant hr2074 was also considered ; fi is not represented in its spectrum .",
    "the contributors to a stellar line at or about fi lines are listed in table 1 ; the lines shown in bold are selected for abundance determination for all the analysed cool ehes .",
    "the additional fi lines listed in table 1 are in the missing wavelength regions of the mcdonald spectra , and , are only used in abundance determination for the cool ehe lss3378 .",
    "the fluorine abundances were determined from the fi lines listed in table 1 , by adopting the same procedure described in @xcite .",
    "a model atmosphere is used with the armagh lte code spectrum @xcite to compute the equivalent width of a fi line or a synthetic spectrum for a selected spectral window .",
    "the synthetic spectrum was convolved with a gaussian profile , to account for the combined effects of the stellar macroturbulence and the intrumental profile , before matching with the observed spectrum .",
    "the fact that several fi lines are blended with other lines requires that the fluorine abundance be extracted by spectrum synthesis .",
    "however , most of the fi lines are only slightly blended in the iron poor cool ehe stars : fqaqr , lss3378 , and lsiv-1@xmath162 .",

    "note that the derived fluorine abundances in lte represent only the first step defining the absolute f abundance in these stars ; more reliable values should , in principle , come from full non - lte calculations .",
    "a good number of fi lines were identified for the first time in the optical spectra of the sample of cool ehe stars .",
    "an abundance analyses of these spectra provide the first abundances of fluorine for cool ehe stars .",
    "the enhanced f abundances ( see figure 4 ) in cool ehes are evidence of nucleosynthesis in their earlier evolution .",
    "the abundances for the other elements presented in figure 4 are adopted from @xcite for fqaqr , lsiv-14@xmath16109 , bd-1@xmath163438 , and lsiv-1@xmath162 , from @xcite for lss3378 , and from @xcite and @xcite for ksper .",
    "the f , c , and o abundances in cool ehes are independent of the star s initial metallicity ( fe abundance ) ; the n abundances , however , show a clear trend with fe ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "these trends clearly suggest that f , c , and o abundances in cool ehes are associated with he - burnt material , and the n abundances are the result of h - burning via cno cycling ; the almost complete conversion of the initial c , n , and o to n is shown in the plot [ n ] vs [ fe ] of figure 4 . during the he - burning thermal pulses @xmath0f is produced , and the initial @xmath11c supply then acts as a limiting factor for the @xmath0f yield . to account for the enhanced f abundances , in cool ehes , with no trend with fe ,",
    "requires a primary @xmath11c supply instead of the secondary @xmath11c supply from the cno cycle ashes .",
    "note the [ f ] vs [ h ] trend of figure 4 .",
    "the f abundances in h - deficient pg1159 stars show a strong variation from star to star , ranging from solar to 250 times solar @xcite . the sample cool ehes show f enhancements about 100 times solar .",
    "note that the models of @xcite , for thermally pulsating agb stars , predict that the f enrichment in the intershell is a strong function of the initial stellar mass ; for solar metallicity models , log @xmath36 , which is about 100 times solar , is maximal at m = 3@xmath43 .",
    "lugaro et al .",
    "conclude that their f intershell abundances are not high enough to explain the enhanced f abundances which were measured in the agb stars from the jorissen et al . sample .",
    "the surface composition of these h - deficient stars : pg1159 and ehe , could be a result of final he - shell flash in a single post - agb star ( ff scenario ) , or a merger of two white dwarfs ( dd scenario ) .",
    "although the ff scenario accounts for pg1159 stars , present theoretical calculations @xcite imply higher c / he and o / he ratios than are observed in ehe stars .",
    "however , dd scenario can account for the observed surface abundances of most of the elements in ehes @xcite .",
    "enrichment of @xmath22-process elements , and also fluorine , is not expected for the ehes resulting from a merger of a he with a c - o white dwarf ( dd scenario ) as discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , synthesis of fluorine and @xmath22-process elements may occur during the merger and needs to be explored .",
    "the @xmath22-process elements are enriched in the cool ehe lss3378 ( see for example , [ zr ] vs [ fe ] of figure 4 ) . the neutron source in ehes showing enriched @xmath22-process elements",
    "is not known . @xmath11c(@xmath1,n)@xmath2o and",
    "@xmath3ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath44 mg are the two possible sources .",
    "if the latter reaction dominates , then f is unlikely to survive in the he - rich intershell , as the reaction rate of @xmath0f(@xmath1,n)@xmath3ne is much higher than that of @xmath3ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath44 mg @xcite . since @xmath0f is overabundant in cool ehes , [ an upper limit to the f abundance for the coolest hot ehe pvtel",
    "is also derived ( see table 2 ) ] , the reaction @xmath3ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath44 mg is unlikely to be the neutron source in ehe stars .",
