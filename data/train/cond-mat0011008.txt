    "ii the manner in which the ccm results for a localised approximation scheme called the lsub@xmath1 scheme ( in which we retain all @xmath2-body correlations defined on all possible locales of @xmath1 adjacent lattice sites ( @xmath3 ) ) are extrapolated to the limit @xmath18 . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results of our high - order treatment of the _ xxz _ model for these lattices , and finally our conclusions are presented in sec . iv .",
    "in this section , we firstly describe the general ground - state ccm formalism @xcite , and then show how to apply it to the specific case of the spin - half _ xxz _ model .",
    "this is then extended to deal with excited states .",
    "the exact ket and bra ground - state energy eigenvectors , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , of a many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath21 , @xmath22 are parametrised within the single - reference ccm as follows : @xmath23 the single model or reference state @xmath24 is required to have the property of being a cyclic vector with respect to two well - defined abelian subalgebras of _ multi - configurational _ creation operators @xmath25 and their hermitian - adjoint destruction counterparts @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 plays the role of a vacuum state with respect to a suitable set of ( mutually commuting ) many - body creation operators @xmath25 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , the identity operator .",
    "these operators are complete in the many - body hilbert ( or fock ) space , @xmath29 the _ correlation operator _",
    "@xmath30 is decomposed entirely in terms of these creation operators @xmath25 , which , when acting on the model state ( @xmath31 ) , create multi - particle excitations on top of the model state .",
    "we note that although the manifest hermiticity , ( @xmath32 is explicitly imposed .",
    "the _ correlation coefficients _",
    "@xmath33 are regarded as being independent variables , even though formally we have the relation , @xmath34 the full set @xmath33 thus provides a complete description of the ground state . for instance , an arbitrary operator @xmath35 will have a ground - state expectation value given as , @xmath36 we note that the exponentiated form of the ground - state ccm parametrisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ensures the correct counting of the _ independent _ and excited correlated many - body clusters with respect to @xmath24 which are present in the exact ground state @xmath19 .",
    "it also ensures the exact incorporation of the goldstone linked - cluster theorem , which itself guarantees the size - extensivity of all relevant extensive physical quantities .",
    "the determination of the correlation coefficients @xmath33 is achieved by taking appropriate projections onto the ground - state schrdinger equations of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , they may be determined variationally by requiring the ground - state energy expectation functional @xmath37 , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , to be stationary with respect to variations in each of the ( independent ) variables of the full set .",
    "we thereby easily derive the following coupled set of equations , @xmath38 { \\rm e}^s|\\phi\\rangle   = 0 , \\;\\ ; \\forall i \\neq 0 \\;\\ ; . \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq7 ] ) also shows that the ground - state energy at the stationary point has the simple form @xmath39 it is important to realize that this ( bi-)variational formulation does _ not _ lead to an upper bound for @xmath40 when the summations for @xmath30 and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) are truncated , due to the lack of exact hermiticity when such approximations are made .",
    "however , it is clear that the important hellmann - feynman theorem _ is _ preserved in all such approximations .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) represents a coupled set of nonlinear multinomial equations for the _ c_-number correlation coefficients @xmath42 . the nested commutator expansion of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian , @xmath43 + { 1\\over2 ! } [ [ h , s],s ] + \\cdots   \\;\\ ; ,   \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] together with the fact that all of the individual components of @xmath30 in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) commute with one another , imply that each element of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is linked directly to the hamiltonian in each of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "thus , each of the coupled equations ( [ eq7 ] ) is of linked - cluster type .",
    "furthermore , each of these equations is of finite length when expanded , since the otherwise infinite series of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) will always terminate at a finite order , provided ( as is usually the case ) only that each term in the second - quantised form of the hamiltonian @xmath21 contains a finite number of single - body destruction operators , defined with respect to the reference ( vacuum ) state @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the ccm parametrisation naturally leads to a workable scheme which can be efficiently implemented computationally .",
    "it is also important to note that at the heart of the ccm lies a similarity transformation , in contrast with the unitary transformation in a standard variational formulation in which the bra state @xmath44 is simply taken as the explicit hermitian adjoint of @xmath19 .",
    "we now wish to apply the general ccm formalism outlined above to the specific case of the spin - half _ xxz _ model , and we choose the nel state , in which the spins lie along the @xmath0-axis , to be the model state .",
    "furthermore , we perform a rotation of the local axes of the up - pointing spins by 180@xmath45 about the @xmath46 axis , so that spins on both sublattices may be treated equivalently .",
    "the ( canonical ) transformation is described by , @xmath47 the model state now appears @xmath48 to consist of purely down - pointing spins in these rotated local axes . in terms of the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath49 the hamiltonian may be written in these local axes as , @xmath50 \\ ; . \\label{eq : newh}\\ ] ] in this article , we also wish to perform high - order ccm calculations for this model , and in order to do this we firstly define the @xmath51 operators more explicitly , as @xmath52 , where the set - index @xmath53 .",
    "each of the single - site indices is allowed to cover _ all _ lattice sites , although double ( or greater ) occupancy of any particular site in any set @xmath54 is explicitly prohibited for the spin - half case , since @xmath55 .",
    "we analogously define the ket - state correlation coefficients as @xmath56 for a cluster @xmath54 defined above . by construction",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 are completely symmetric under the interchange of any two indices .",
    "it is also useful to define the following two operators , @xmath58 the similarity transform of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) may now be written in terms of these operators .",
    "we find explicitly that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 we note that the similarity - transformed hamiltonian acting on the model state @xmath61 has now been written purely in terms of spin - raising operators .",
    "the problem of determining a given ccm ket - state equation , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) for a given cluster of index @xmath54 , thus becomes an exercise in pattern - matching the spin - lowering operators in @xmath62 to the terms in @xmath63 contained in eqs .",
    "( [ eq13]-[eq15 ] ) .",
    "this task is perfectly suited to implementation using computer algebra techniques , and the ensuing set of coupled , non - linear ket - state equations is then easily solved ( for example , using the newton - raphson method ) .",
    "once the ket - state correlation coefficients have been determined it is then possible to find the bra - state coefficients similarly , as described in ref .",
    "one may finally calculate any ground - state expectation values that one wishes to obtain in terms of the coefficients @xmath64 .",
    "an example of this is the sublattice magnetisation , given by @xmath65 in the rotated spin coordinates defined above .",
    "the quantity provides a measure for the amount of nel ordering in the @xmath0-direction remaining in the ccm ground state , @xmath66 , with respect to the perfect ordering ( @xmath67 ) of the model state .",
    "the ccm formalism is exact in the limit of inclusion of all possible multi - spin cluster correlations within @xmath30 and @xmath68 , although in any real application this is usually impossible to achieve .",
    "it is therefore necessary to utilise various approximation schemes within @xmath30 and @xmath41 .",
    "the three most commonly employed schemes have been : ( 1 ) the sub@xmath69 scheme , in which all correlations involving only @xmath69 or fewer spins are retained , but no further restriction is made concerning their spatial separation on the lattice ; ( 2 ) the sub@xmath69-@xmath1 sub - approximation , in which all sub@xmath69 correlations spanning a range of no more than @xmath1 adjacent lattice sites are retained ; and ( 3 ) the localised lsub@xmath1 scheme , in which all multi - spin correlations over distinct locales on the lattice defined by @xmath1 or fewer contiguous sites are retained .",
    "note that for this system we also make the specific and explicit restriction that the creation operators @xmath70 in @xmath30 preserve the relationship that , in the original ( unrotated ) spin coordinates , @xmath71 in order to keep the approximate ccm ground - state wave function in the correct ( @xmath72 ) subspace . the number of such distinct ( or fundamental ) configurations for the ground state at a given level of approximation is labelled by @xmath73 .",
    "we denote as distinct configurations those which are inequivalent under the point and space group symmetries of the both the lattice and the hamiltonian .    in practice",
    "we find that the ccm equations often terminate at specific critical values ( denoted @xmath74 ) of the anisotropy parameter which are dependent on the particular approximation scheme chosen , such that no solution based on this model state exists for @xmath75 . at these _",
    "critical points _ the second derivative of the ground - state energy is found to diverge , and the critical points have been shown to reflect the corresponding phase transition point in the real system .",
    "we now turn our attention to the ccm parametrisation of the excited state developed by emrich @xcite , and as a specific example we present results for the high - order treatment of the excited states of the spin - half _ xxz _ model .",
    "an excited - state wave function , @xmath76 , is determined by linearly applying an excitation operator @xmath77 to the ket - state wave function of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , such that @xmath78 this equation may now be used to determine the low - lying excitation energies , such that the schrdinger equation , @xmath79 , may be combined with its ground - state counterpart of eq .",

    "\\phi \\rangle ) ~~ , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the excitation energy . by analogy with the ground - state formalism",
    ", the excited - state correlation operator is written as , @xmath82 where the set @xmath83 of multi - spin creation operators may differ from those used in the ground - state parametrisation in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) if the excited state has different quantum numbers than the ground state .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) implies the overlap relation @xmath84 . by applying @xmath85 to eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) we find that , @xmath86 e^s | \\phi   \\rangle ~~ , \\forall i \\ne 0 ~~ ,   \\label{temp1}\\ ] ] which is a generalised set of eigenvalue equations with eigenvalues @xmath87 and corresponding eigenvectors @xmath88 , for each of the excited states which satisfy @xmath84 .",
    "analogously to the ground - state case , we define the excited - state operators @xmath89 the state , @xmath90",
    "e^s | \\phi \\rangle$ ] , may now be divided into three elements , @xmath91 , such that ( after collecting together like terms ) we find the following expressions , @xmath92 we note again that @xmath8 runs over all nearest - neighbour lattice vectors and that terms which are equivalent under a lattice translation which connects one sublattice to the other have been collected together in eqs .",
    "( [ eq21])-([eq23 ] ) . in order to determine explicitly the eigenvalue equation of eq .",
    "( [ temp1 ] ) we now _ pattern match _ the configurations in the set @xmath93 to the spin - raising operators contained in @xmath94 , analogously to the ground - state procedure .",
    "for low orders of approximation , this may be performed readily by hand , although for higher orders of approximation may one must again use computational methods .",
    "we note that the lowest - lying excited states for the _ xxz _ model lie in the @xmath95 and @xmath96 subspaces with respect to the `` unrotated '' ground state .",
    "we thus restrict the `` fundamental '' clusters in the set @xmath70 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) to be those which reflect this property , and the number of such fundamental configurations for the excited state at a given level of lsub@xmath1 approximation is denoted by @xmath97 . in order to solve fully the eigenvalue problem at a given value of @xmath12",
    ", we note furthermore that one must firstly fully determine and solve the ground ket - state equations in order to obtain numerical values for the set @xmath42 which are then used as input to the eigenvalue problem of eq .",
    "( [ temp1 ] ) .",
    "the level of lsub@xmath1 approximation is also explicitly restricted to be the same for the ground and excited states , such that the calculation is kept as systematic and self - consistent as possible .",
    "finally , we note that for the specific case of the spin - half _ xxz _ model considered here , we only consider the lowest eigenvalue of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) in order to calculate the excitation energy gap .",
    "we furthermore note that this eigenvalue is not specifically restricted by our truncation procedure to be a real number as the generalised eigenvalue problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is not constrained to be symmetric .",
    "however , in practice we find that this eigenvalue is real at every value of @xmath12 considered , for each lattice , and at each level of lsub@xmath1 approximation .",
    "this provides a rather stringent check on the approximation scheme .",
    "we present results below of high - order ccm calculations for the spin - half _ xxz _ model for the linear chain , square lattice , and simple cubic lattice .",
    "in particular , we determine the ground - state energy , the sublattice magnetisation , and the lowest - lying excited - state energy for these models using the lsub@xmath1 approximation scheme .",
    "it is clearly useful to be able to extrapolate the `` raw '' ccm results , at each value of @xmath12 separately , to the limit @xmath98 . in the absence of any rigorous scaling theory for the results of lsub@xmath1 approximations",
    ", two empirical approaches are outlined below and utilised .",
    "the first approach , denoted to as `` extrapolated(1 ) ccm , '' assumes a leading `` power - law '' dependence of the lsub@xmath1 expectation values with @xmath1 .",
    "the value for the ground - state energy , sublattice magnetisation , or excitation energy ( at a given value of @xmath12 ) is denoted by @xmath99 for a given value of @xmath1 where @xmath100 .",
    "the index @xmath9 denotes the i@xmath101 data element of @xmath102 such elements , although we note that @xmath9 and @xmath1 do not have to be explicitly equivalent .",
    "the leading `` power - law '' extrapolation is now described by , @xmath103 we plot @xmath104 against @xmath105 and the best fit of the data set , @xmath106 , to the power - law dependence given above is obtained when the absolute value of the _ linear correlation _ of these points is maximised with respect to the variable @xmath107 .",
    "this value of @xmath107 is then assumed to be the extrapolated value for @xmath99 in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "the second such extrapolation scheme of the lsub@xmath1 data , denoted the `` extrapolated(2 ) ccm ''",
    "scheme , uses pad approximants in which the data set is modeled by the ratio of two polynomials , given by @xmath108 this furthermore implies that , @xmath109 we now wish to determine the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 in order to find the polynomials in the equation above , and the above equation is rewritten in terms of a matrix given by , @xmath112 ( note that @xmath113 . )",
    "this problem may be easily solved by inverting the matrix in order to determine the coefficients @xmath114 and @xmath115 at each value of @xmath12 separately . in the limit , @xmath98",
    ", it is seen that the extrapolated value of @xmath99 is given by @xmath116 .",
    "we furthermore note that the case @xmath117 corresponds also to a `` least - squares '' fit of the @xmath102 data points to a @xmath118-order polynomial .",
    "previous extrapolation results @xcite for the haf on the square lattice fitted @xmath99 against @xmath119 for the ground - state energy , @xmath120 , and the critical points , @xmath74 , while the sublattice magnetisation was fitted against @xmath121 .",
    "these `` rules '' were chosen because the ccm sub2-@xmath69 calculations for the square lattice haf were found to converge as a function of @xmath69 to their full sub2 solution in these ways , and so analogous rules were used for the lsub@xmath1 data .",
    "note that results for the haf on the square and simple cubic lattices using these procedures are also quoted below . for the spin - half square lattice",
    "haf , we find that the present rules are reasonable approximations for the scaling of the lsub@xmath1 results .",
    "finally , we note that the lsub2 results for @xmath99 and @xmath122 generally fit in rather poorly to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath99 and @xmath122 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "as we are interested in the asymptotic value of @xmath99 , it is found that we obtain better extrapolated results by discarding the lowest order lsub2 results where possible , i.e. , for the linear chain and square lattice results . hence for both extrapolation schemes used here , lsub@xmath1 results are used with @xmath123 for the linear chain , with @xmath124 for the square lattice , but with @xmath125 for the simple cubic lattice .",
    "the results for the ground - state energy , @xmath120 , of the ccm treatment of the spin - half linear chain _ xxz _ model regime @xmath126 are found to be in excellent agreement with exact results @xcite over the whole of this regime , ( and therefore no graphical plot of this data is given ) .",
    "table [ tab1 ] indicates the accuracy of the raw and extrapolated lsub@xmath1 for the spin - half linear chain haf ( @xmath16 ) in comparison with exact bethe ansatz @xcite results .",
    "it is seen that all of the extrapolated results for the ground - state energy , apart from those of the extrapolated(2 ) ccm scheme with @xmath127 , are accurate to at least five decimal places .",
    "indeed , the spin - half linear chain haf is the `` worst - case - scenario '' within this regime for such ccm calculations .",
    "thus , for @xmath128 even better accuracy is obtained , and indeed the ccm results are exact at all levels of approximation in the limit @xmath129 , in which case the model state is the exact quantum ground state .",
    "the results for the sublattice magnetisation , @xmath130 , of this model using the ccm are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the ccm results tend to the exact results as @xmath12 increases , although they are non - zero and positive at @xmath16 . the raw ccm results may be greatly improved by extrapolation , and the extrapolated(1 ) ccm results of @xmath131 is in good agreement with the exact result that @xmath130 becomes zero at @xmath16 .",
    "the extrapolated(2 ) ccm results do not perform quite as well as the extrapolated(1 ) ccm results , although they do present a very significant improvement on the raw lsub@xmath1 results . however , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the results of both extrapolations are in good qualitative agreement with exact results , and we note that the spin - half haf on the linear chain presents a particularly difficult challenge , since not only does all of the nel - like long - range order inherent in the model state disappear at this point but also there is an infinite - order phase transition at this point ( i.e. , one in which the energy and all of its derivatives with respect to @xmath12 are continuous ) .",
    "an indication of the efficacy of the ccm treatment of this model is also given for the lowest - lying excitation energy , as shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the extrapolated results are in excellent agreement with the exact result , and are very much better than those results of linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) over the whole of this regime . indeed , the manner in which the ccm results for the excitation energy behave as @xmath132 is in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the exact results .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the results of lswt in 1d which clearly show completely incorrect qualitative behaviour for @xmath87 near to @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , table [ tab1 ] indicates that the extrapolated(2 ) ccm results for the excitation energy of the spin - half linear chain haf are zero to three decimal places of accuracy .",
    "the extrapolated(1 ) results are also consistent with a gapless spectrum at @xmath16 .    the various ccm results for the ground - state energy of the spin - half square lattice _ xxz",
    "_ model are found to be in excellent mutual agreement over a wide range of @xmath12 .",
    "this may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in which both the `` raw '' ground - state energy ccm lsub@xmath1 results for @xmath133 and extrapolated ccm results are plotted for this model .",

    "[ fig3 ] that our results are in excellent agreement with those results of the qmc method given in ref .",

    "table [ tab2 ] illustrates the ccm results for the special case of the spin - half haf , and it is seen that ccm results are in excellent agreement ( see also for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) with those results of swt @xcite , finite - sized calculations @xcite , series expansions @xcite , and qmc techniques @xcite .",
    "however , our results for the spin - half square lattice haf perhaps indicate that the ground - state energy might be slightly lower than the best qmc estimate obtained to date of sandvik @xcite which is , namely , @xmath134 .",

    "we also note that the expansion coefficient of the @xmath117 pad approximant ( viz . , the series in integral powers of @xmath139 ) which becomes overwhelmingly dominant as @xmath132 is the coefficient which corresponds to the @xmath136 term .",
    "thus , the extrapolated(1 ) and extrapolated(2 ) results have independently reinforced what were the admittedly `` naive '' assumptions made in the `` previous '' extrapolation @xcite in which the ground - state energy for the square lattice haf is fitted to a quadratic function in @xmath136 .",
    "( note that similar results for the scaling of the ground - state energy are also observed for both the linear chain and simple cubic lattice . )",

    "however , we note that the extrapolated(1 ) ccm result for the haf of @xmath142 given in table [ tab2 ] probably lies slightly too low .",
    "this is because the critical exponent @xmath137 for the sublattice magnetisation appears to change very rapidly near to the haf point for the square lattice , where , for example , we find that @xmath143 at @xmath144 and that @xmath145 at @xmath16 .",
    "it is expected however that the inclusion of the second - order term to the extrapolation using a leading - order power - law scaling would remedy this situation .",
    "we may see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , however , that the extrapolated(2 ) ccm results appear to work extremely well up to and including the haf itself .",

    "these results look qualitatively very similar to those for the square lattice model and so are not plotted here .",
    "it is seen from table [ tab3 ] that the results for the ground- and excited - state properties of the cubic - lattice haf are in good agreement with those results of lswt .",
    "the results for ground - state energy of the spin - half cubic - lattice haf are shown in table [ tab3 ] , and it is seen that the lsub6 approximation is already quite near the converged limit .",
    "the extrapolated(1 ) and extrapolated(2 ) ccm results and the `` previous extrapolated ccm '' result for the ground - state energy are thus seen to be in mutual agreement with each other . for the sublattice magnetisation of the spin - half cubic - lattice haf ,",
    "the extrapolated ccm results give values of @xmath150 , and this result is in excellent agreement with the result of lswt of @xmath151 .",
    "by contrast , the extrapolated(1 ) ccm result appears to lie too low for the lowest - lying excitation energy of the simple cubic - lattice haf .",
    "however , the extrapolated(2 ) ccm @xmath117 and @xmath147 results indicate that the spin - half cubic - lattice haf is gapless with results of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively , which is once again consistent with the expected behaviour of this model .    the results for the critical point of the spin - half cubic - lattice _ xxz",
    "_ model appear to converge to a value near to @xmath16 , which is again believed to be ( or be near to ) the correct result .",
    "( note that with only two points an assumption must be made as to the scaling of @xmath74 with @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in analogy with sub2-@xmath69 results the lsub@xmath1 values for @xmath74 were plotted against @xmath136 and linearly extrapolated , and so these results are referred to as the `` previous extrapolated ccm '' result in table [ tab3 ] . )",
    "in this article new results have been presented for the ground - state properties of the spin - half _ xxz _ model on the linear chain , the square lattice , and the simple cubic lattice .",
    "a localised approximation scheme was utilised within the ccm ground - state formalism , and this allowed high - order calculations to be very efficiently performed .",
    "the results were seen to be in excellent agreement with exact bethe ansatz calculations for the linear chain and the best results of other approximate methods for the square and simple cubic lattices .",
    "these results were extrapolated using a number of techniques which extend previous heuristic attempts at extrapolation .",
    "the results so obtained are of very high quality across a very wide range of the anisotropy parameter @xmath12 , thus reinforcing our results at the specific point for the heisenberg antiferromagnet at @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , it was found from these calculations that our previous heuristic extrapolations for the ground - state energy of the spin - half square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet did , in fact , provide very reasonable results , and that the naive assumptions made in this extrapolation were largely justified .",
    "hence , for example , the previous `` best estimate '' of the ground - state energy of the spin - half square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet of @xmath154 was justified .",
    "furthermore , our ccm calculations for spin - half heisenberg antiferromagnet indicate that about 62@xmath17 of the classical nel ordering remains for the square lattice case , and that 83.6@xmath17 of the classical nel ordering remains for the simple cubic lattice case .",
    "a new formalism has also been introduced in order to treat for the first time the excited states of lattice quantum spin systems via the same high - order localised approximation scheme in a computationally efficient manner .",
    "the approximation level was kept at the same subapproximation level for both the ground and excited states , although the ccm ground - state correlations preserved the @xmath155 property of the ground state and the ccm excited - state correlations produced a change of @xmath156 with respect to the ccm approximation to the ket ground state .",
    "extrapolations were again attempted in the @xmath126 regime and very good correspondence of the extrapolated ccm results for the lowest - lying excitation energy were observed for the linear chain in comparison with the exact bethe ansatz results .",
    "furthermore , the results for the spin - half heisenberg antiferromagnet , for all of the lattices considered here , strongly indicate that the excitation energy gaps of these models are zero .",
    "future applications of the high - order formalism presented in this article will be to systems of complex crystallographic point- and space - group symmetries , e.g. , those of the cavo .",
    "another extension will be to apply these methods to systems of higher quantum spin number , @xmath157 .",
    "in particular , it would be of interest to apply the new high - order formalism for the excited state to the spin - one linear chain heisenberg antiferromagnet which contains an excitation energy gap . the high - order formalism",
    "might also be applied to systems with electronic ( rather than just spin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , the application of the ccm to spin systems at non - zero temperature remains a future goal .",
