    "in the theory of critical phenomena it is usually assumed that a physical system near a continuous phase transition is characterized by a single length scale ( the `` correlation length '' ) in terms of which all other lengths should be measured . when combined with the experimental observation that the correlation length diverges at the phase transition , this simple but strong assumption , known as the scaling hypothesis , leads to the belief that at criticality the system has no characteristic length , and is therefore invariant under scale transformations .",
    "this suggests that all thermodynamic functions at criticality are homogeneous functions , and predicts the appearance of power laws .",
    "it also means that it should be possible to rescale a critical system appropriately and obtain a continuum model ( the `` continuum scaling limit '' ) which may have more symmetries and be easier to study than the original discrete model defined on a lattice .",
    "indeed , thanks to the work of polyakov  @xcite and others  @xcite , it was understood by physicists since the early seventies that critical statistical mechanical models should possess continuum scaling limits with a global conformal invariance that goes beyond simple scale invariance , as long as the discrete models have `` enough '' rotation invariance .",
    "this property gives important information , enabling the determination of two- and three - point functions at criticality , when they are nonvanishing . because the conformal group is in general a finite dimensional lie group ,",
    "the resulting constraints are limited in number ; however , the situation becomes particularly interesting in two dimensions , since there every analytic function @xmath1 defines a conformal transformation , at least at points where @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the conformal group in two dimensions is infinite - dimensional .",
    "after this observation was made , a large number of critical problems in two dimensions were analyzed using conformal methods , which were applied , among others , to ising and potts models , brownian motion , self - avoiding walk ( saw ) , percolation , and diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) .",
    "the large body of knowledge and techniques that resulted , starting with the work of belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov  @xcite in the early eighties , goes under the name of conformal field theory ( cft ) . in two dimensions ,",
    "one of the main goals of cft and its most important application to statistical mechanics is a complete classification of all universality classes via irreducible representations of the infinite - dimensional virasoro algebra . partly because of the success of cft , work in recent years on critical phenomena seemed to slow down somewhat , probably due to the feeling that most of the leading problems had been resolved",
    "nonetheless , however powerful and successful it may be , cft has some limitations and leaves various open problems .",
    "first of all , the theory deals primarily with correlation functions of _ local _ ( or quasi - local ) operators , and is therefore not always the best tool to investigate other quantities .",
    "secondly , given some critical lattice model , there is no way , within the theory itself , of deciding to which cft it corresponds .",
    "a third limitation , of a different nature , is due to the fact that the methods of cft , although very powerful , are generally speaking not completely rigorous from a mathematical point of view .    in a somewhat surprising twist ,",
    "the most recent developments in the area of two - dimensional critical phenomena have emerged in the mathematics literature and have followed a new direction , which has provided new tools and a way of coping with at least some of the limitations of cft .",
    "the new approach may even provide a reinterpretation of cft , and seems to be complementary to the traditional one in the sense that questions that are difficult to pose and/or answer within cft are easy and natural in this new approach and vice versa .",
    "the main tool of this radically new approach is the stochastic loewner evolution ( @xmath3 ) , or schramm loewner evolution , as it is also known , introduced by schramm  @xcite .",
    "the new approach , which is probabilistic in nature , focuses directly on non - local structures that characterize a given system , such as cluster boundaries in ising , potts and percolation models , or loops in the @xmath4 model . at criticality ,",
    "these non - local objects become , in the continuum limit , random curves whose distributions can be uniquely identified thanks to their conformal invariance and a certain  markovian \" property .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of @xmath3s , indexed by a positive real number @xmath5 , and they appear to be the only possible candidates for the scaling limits of interfaces of two - dimensional critical systems that are believed to be conformally invariant .    in particular , substantial progress has been made in recent years , thanks to @xmath3 , in understanding the fractal and conformally invariant nature of ( the scaling limit of ) large percolation clusters , which has attracted much attention and is of interest both for intrinsic reasons , given the many applications of percolation , and as a paradigm for the behavior of other systems .",
    "the work of schramm  @xcite and smirnov  @xcite has identified the scaling limit of a certain percolation interface with @xmath0 , providing , along with the work of lawler - schramm - werner  @xcite and smirnov - werner  @xcite , a confirmation of many results in the physics literature , as well as some new results .",
    "however , @xmath0 describes a single interface , which can be obtained by imposing special boundary conditions , and is not in itself sufficient to immediately describe the full scaling limit of the system .",
    "in fact , not only the nature and properties , but the very existence of the full scaling limit remained an open question . this is true of all models , such as ising and potts models , that are represented in terms of clusters .",
    "werner  @xcite considered this problem in the context of @xmath6 for values of @xmath5 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for percolation ( corresponding to @xmath9 )",
    ", the same problem was addressed in  @xcite , where @xmath0 was used to construct a random process of continuous loops in the plane , which was identified with the full scaling limit of critical two - dimensional percolation , but without detailed proofs .    in this paper",
    ", we complete the analysis of  @xcite , making rigorous the connection between the construction given there and the full scaling limit of percolation , and we prove some properties of the full scaling limit , the continuum nonsimple loop process , including ( one version of ) conformal invariance .",
    "we do this in two parts .",
    "first , we give proofs in which we assume the validity of what we will call statement ( s ) ( see section  [ main - results ] ) , which is a specific version of the results of schramm and of smirnov  @xcite concerning convergence of percolation exploration paths to @xmath0 ( see the discussion towards the end of section  [ explo ] ) .",
    "since no detailed proof of statement ( s ) ( or indeed , any version of convergence to @xmath0 ) has been available , in appendix  [ convergence - to - sle ] we give a proof based only on that part of smirnov s results about the convergence of crossing probabilities to cardy s formula  @xcite ( see theorem  [ cardy - smirnov ] in appendix  [ convergence - to - sle ] ) .",
    "we note that statement ( s ) is restricted to jordan domains while no such restriction is indicated in  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ defs ] , we give necessary definitions and introduce @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ construct ] is devoted to the construction of the continuum nonsimple loop process . in section  [ lapa ] ,",
    "we introduce the discrete model and a discrete construction analogous to the continuum one presented in section  [ construct ] .",
    "most of the main results of this paper are stated in section  [ main - results ] , while section  [ proofs ] contains the proofs of those results , which use ( s ) .",
    "the long appendix  [ convergence - to - sle ] contains the proof of statement ( s ) ( it is a consequence of corollary  [ conv - to - sle-1 ] there ) and the short appendix  [ rado ] contains convergence results for sequences of conformal maps which are used throughout the paper .",
    "we remark that although our proof in appendix  [ convergence - to - sle ] of convergence of exploration paths to @xmath0 roughly follows smirnov s outline  @xcite , based on his proof  @xcite of convergence of crossing probabilities to cardy s formula and on the markovian properties of hulls and tips , there are at least two technically significant modifications .",
    "the first is that we use a different sequence of stopping times to obtain a markov chain approximation to @xmath0 , which results in a different geometry for the approximation ( see remark  [ remark - difference ] ) .",
    "the second is that the control of  close encounters \" by the exploration path to the domain boundary is not handled by general results for  three - arms \" events at the boundary of a half - plane , but rather by an argument based on continuity of crossing probabilities with respect to domain boundaries ( see lemmas  [ double - crossing ] , [ touching ] , [ equal ] and  [ mushroom ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can not use directly smirnov s result on convergence of crossing probabilities ( see theorem  [ cardy - smirnov ] ) , but need an extended version which is given in theorem  [ strong - cardy ] of appendix  [ convergence - to - sle ] .",
    "we conclude by noting that the convergence results of appendix  [ convergence - to - sle ] are sufficient not only for our purposes of obtaining the full scaling limit , but also for obtaining the critical exponents ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we will find it convenient to identify the real plane @xmath10 and the complex plane @xmath11 .",
    "we will also refer to the riemann sphere @xmath12 and the open upper half - plane @xmath13 ( and its closure @xmath14 ) , where chordal @xmath3 will be defined ( see section  [ sle1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 will denote the open unit disc @xmath16 .",
    "a domain @xmath17 of the complex plane @xmath11 is a nonempty , connected , open subset of @xmath11 ; a simply connected domain @xmath17 is said to be a jordan domain if its ( topological ) boundary @xmath18 is a jordan curve ( i.e. , a simple continuous loop ) .",
    "we will make repeated use of riemann s mapping theorem , which states that if @xmath17 is any simply connected domain other than the entire plane @xmath11 and @xmath19 , then there is a unique conformal map @xmath20 of @xmath17 onto @xmath15 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "when taking the scaling limit @xmath23 one can focus on fixed finite regions , @xmath24 , or consider the whole @xmath10 at once .",
    "the second option avoids dealing with boundary conditions , but requires an appropriate choice of metric",
    ".    a convenient way of dealing with the whole @xmath10 is to replace the euclidean metric with a distance function @xmath25 defined on @xmath26 by @xmath27 where the infimum is over all smooth curves @xmath28 joining @xmath29 with @xmath30 , parametrized by arclength @xmath31 , and where @xmath32 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "this metric is equivalent to the euclidean metric in bounded regions , but it has the advantage of making @xmath10 precompact . adding a single point at infinity yields the compact space @xmath33 which is isometric , via stereographic projection , to the two - dimensional sphere .      in dealing with the scaling limit",
    "we use the approach of aizenman - burchard  @xcite .",

    "we denote by @xmath48 its borel @xmath49-algebra .    for each fixed @xmath50 , the random curves that we consider are polygonal paths on the edges of the hexagonal lattice @xmath51 , dual to the triangular lattice @xmath52 .",
    "a superscript @xmath53 is added to indicate that the curves correspond to a model with a `` short distance cutoff '' of magnitude @xmath53 .",

    "we denote by @xmath59 its borel @xmath49-algebra .",
    "when we talk about convergence in distribution of random curves , we always mean with respect to the uniform metric  ( [ distance ] ) , while when we deal with closed collections of curves , we always refer to the metric  ( [ hausdorff ] ) or  ( [ hausdorff - d ] ) .",
    "[ ab ] in this paper , the space @xmath57 of closed sets of @xmath58 is generally used for collections of exploration paths and cluster boundary loops and their scaling limits , @xmath0 paths and continuum nonsimple loops .",

    "we give to the boundary of a domain of type  3 or 4 the orientation induced by how the curve @xmath38 winds around the points inside that domain . for a domain @xmath117 of type  1 or 2 which is produced by an  excursion \" @xmath118 from @xmath119 to @xmath120 , the part of the boundary that corresponds to the inner perimeter of the excursion @xmath118 ( i.e.",
