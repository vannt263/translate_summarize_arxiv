    "since rediscovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) phenomena , perovskite manganese oxides have attracted much attention . @xcite this family of compounds shows a variety of physical properties in magnetic ( ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism ) , charge ( metal , insulator , or charge ordering ) , and orbital / lattice ( orbital ordering and/or jahn - teller distortion ) degrees of freedom .",
    "phase transitions between different ordered phases can be controlled by chemical substitution of the _ a _ site in the general chemical formula _ a_mno@xmath4 .",
    "the magnitude of the cmr effect also changes drastically for different _",
    "a_-site ions , hence , one of the most important issues in this field is to understand the role of the _ a_-site substitution .",
    "the ferromagnetic metallic state , which is widely stable at low temperatures in these compounds , @xcite is basically understood by the zener s double exchange ( de ) mechanism . @xcite the kinetics of itinerant electrons in the mn @xmath5 bands strongly correlates with localized spins in the @xmath6 levels through the large hunds - rule coupling ; ferromagnetism of the localized spins leads to high conductivity of the electrons , and vice versa .",
    "thus , the issue is what is an additional element to the de interaction which is necessary to explain deviations from this canonical de behavior and instabilities towards a variety of different phases in the _ a_-site substituted materials .    among various manganese oxides , it has been recognized that la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath4 ( lsmo ) at @xmath9 is a canonical de system .",
    "@xcite namely , the simple de model can explain magnetic , transport and optical properties of this material quantitatively .",
    "for instance , the experimental value of the curie temperature @xmath10 is well reproduced by recent theoretical calculations in the de model .",
    "@xcite this material shows relatively high @xmath10 compared to other manganese oxides , which also suggests the stability of ferromagnetic metal due to the primary role of the de mechanism and the irrelevance of other additional factors .",
    "this canonical de system gives a good starting point to examine effects of the _ a_-site substitution .",
    "there are two different ways of the systematic _ a_-site substitution .",
    "one is the substitution with different ionic valences , such as the control of @xmath11 in la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath4 .",
    "the mixture of trivalent ( la@xmath12 ) and divalent ( sr@xmath13 ) ions effectively changes the nominal valence of manganese ion as mn@xmath14 , which controls the electron density in the mn - o network .",
    "the other substitution is by different ionic radii at a fixed valence , such as _ a_@xmath7_a_@xmath15mno@xmath16 for different combinations of , for instance , _",
    "a_=la , pr , nd , y and _ a_=ba , sr , ca at a fixed @xmath11 .",
    "these two different substitutions cause systematic and drastic deviations from the canonical de behavior in lsmo compounds at @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss mainly the latter _",
    "a_-site substitution with the ionic - radius control in the following .",
    "the change of the ionic radii is a sort of the chemical pressure , which modifies length and angle of mn - o - mn bonds .",
    "this leads to the change of effective transfer integrals between mn ions , namely , the bandwidth of the electrons .",
    "thus , this substitution has been often called the bandwidth control . this terminology ` bandwidth control ' , however , might be misleading : there are many experimental facts which can not be explained only by the change of the bandwidth .",
    "one is a rapid decrease of @xmath10 compared to the bandwidth change .",
    "@xcite @xmath10 decreases as the averaged radius of the _ a _ ions decreases ; however , the change of @xmath10 is much larger than that of the bandwidth which is estimated from the structural change .",
    "for instance , from la@xmath17sr@xmath18mno@xmath4 to la@xmath17ca@xmath18mno@xmath4 ( lcmo ) , @xmath10 decreases by about @xmath19% while the estimated bandwidth decreases by less than @xmath20% .",
    "@xcite since , in the de theory , @xmath10 is proportional to the bandwidth , the large change of @xmath10 can not be explained by the bandwidth change alone .",
    "there should be a hidden parameter which strongly suppresses the kinetics of the electrons .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the quenched disorder for a candidate of the hidden parameter in this _",
    "a_-site substitution . in general ,",
    "oxides are known to be far from perfect crystals . moreover , in these manganese oxides , the disorder is inevitably introduced since they are solid solutions of different _ a_-site ions .",
    "the importance of the disorder has been pointed out in several experimental results : ( i ) @xmath10 changes not only as the average of the ionic radius but also as its standard deviation . @xcite",
    "even if the average is the same , @xmath10 becomes lower for larger standard deviation .",
    "( ii ) the residual resistivity , namely , the value of the resistivity extrapolated to zero temperature , becomes larger for lower-@xmath10 compounds .",
    "@xcite ( iii ) _ a_-site ordered materials , in which different _ a _ ions form a periodic ordered structure , exhibit higher @xmath10 compared to compounds with random distribution of _ a _ ions in the same chemical formula .",
    "@xcite all these experimental results suggest that the disorder in the random mixture of different size ions scatters the itinerant electrons and suppresses the kinetics of them .    in this paper , we discuss the disorder effect on spin dynamics in the _ a_-site substituted manganites .",
    "the spin dynamics is another important indication of a hidden parameter .",
    "spin excitation spectrum shows qualitative changes for the _ a_-site substitution . in compounds with relatively high",
    "@xmath10 such as lsmo , the spin excitation shows a cosine type dispersion , which is similar to that of heisenberg spin systems .",
    "@xcite this behavior is well described by the de mechanism alone .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , in compounds with low @xmath10 such as lcmo , the spectrum shows significant deviations from this form , e.g. , some anomalies such as broadening , softening , and gap opening . @xcite to explain these anomalies is one of the crucial test for elucidating the hidden parameter .",
    "we will demonstrate here that the disorder gives a comprehensive understanding of systematic changes of the spin excitation spectrum as well as other experimental results described above .",
    "several other mechanisms have been proposed , for instance , antiferromagnetic interactions between localized spins , @xcite orbital degrees of freedom in the @xmath5 bands , @xcite the electron - lattice coupling , @xcite and the electron - electron correlation .",
    "@xcite through the detailed analysis of the spectrum , we will show that the disorder appears to be promising among these scenarios .",

    "[ sec : broadening ] , the experimental results in the bilayer compounds show the dominance of the marginally coherent regime . from the above conclusion , this indicates that in real materials the mesoscopic - scale disorder is more relevant than the atomic - scale disorder if the disorder plays a major role in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "possible sources of the mesoscopic - scale disorder are a large - scale inhomogeneity or clustering of the _ a _ ions , twin lattice structure , and grain boundaries .",
    "we propose here some experiments to test our disorder scenario .",
    "\\(i ) sample dependence : our scenario predicts a correlation between the sample quality and the anomalies in the spin excitation spectrum . even in the same chemical formula ,",
    "the extent of the anomalies may depend on the sample quality .",
    "the purity of samples can be measured independently , for instance , by the magnitude of the residual resistivity . in this test",
    ", we note that the _ a_-site ordered manganites @xcite will be useful . in these materials , the disorder strength due to the alloying effect in the _",
    "a_-site ions can be tuned to some extent by the careful treatment of the syntheses .",
    "it is interesting to compare the spin excitation spectrum in the _",
    "a_-site ordered compound with that in the ordinary solid - solution ( _ a_-site disordered ) compound in the same chemical formula .",
    "\\(ii ) comparison with the fermi surface : the spin excitation anomalies in our results appear strongly near the fermi wavenumber .",
    "it is crucial to compare the position of the anomalies with the information of the fermi surface .",
    "the fermi surface can be independently determined , for instance , by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "\\(iii ) doping dependence : closely related to the above test ( ii ) , the doping dependence is also a key experiment . in our scenario , by controlling the doping concentration , the position of the anomalies shifts due to the change of the fermi surface .",
    "moreover , the anomalies become more conspicuous for lower doping concentration .",
    "\\(iv ) high energy excitation : our scenario predicts the anticrossing instead of the softening .",
    "hence , near the zone boundary , there remains the higher energy excitation above the lower energy branch which looks like to be softened . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : softening ] , this point is different from several other theoretical proposals . at the same time , it is important to identify the optical phonon mode , especially near the zone center , for examining the relevance of the magnon - phonon coupling as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : softening ] .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to study the higher energy region over the whole brillouin zone .",
    "\\(v ) @xmath2 dependence of the linewidth : our results indicate that irrespective of the spatial dimension , the linewidth of the spectrum is proportional to @xmath2 near the zone center and shows a crossover to @xmath3 behavior as @xmath2 increases . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : omega and gamma ] , this @xmath2 dependence appears to be consistent with the experimental result in the bilayer manganite . in all other scenarios ,",
    "the linewidth in the ground state comes from the interplay between charge and spin which is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : broadening ] .",
    "this predicts @xmath210 behavior near the zone center .",
    "it is strongly desired to examine the linewidth more quantitatively especially in 3d compounds .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the disorder effects on the spin excitation spectrum in the double exchange model .",
    "we have applied the spin wave approximation in the lowest order of @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the analytical expressions are obtained for the spin stiffness , the excitation energy , and the linewidth .",
    "the most important result revealed by the extensive numerical calculations is that the spin excitation spectrum shows some anomalies in the presence of the disorder , such as broadening , branching , or anticrossing with gap opening .",
    "the origin of these anomalies is the friedel oscillation : disorder causes the @xmath166 oscillation of the spin and charge density in the fully polarized ferromagnetic state , which scatters the magnons to cause the anticrossing in their dispersion .",
    "thus , the spin excitation anomalies are the consequence of the strong interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "our results have been compared with experimental results in the",
    "_ a_-site substituted manganites which shows relatively low-@xmath10 , and the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "we have also compared our results with other theoretical proposals for the anomalous spin excitation in these manganites , and clarified the advantages of our disorder scenario .",
    "another important finding is the incoherence of the magnon excitation .",
    "we have shown that near the zone center the linewidth is proportional to the magnitude of the wavenumber @xmath2 , which becomes larger than the excitation energy which scales to @xmath3 .",
    "this incoherence comes from the local fluctuations of the transfer energy of itinerant electrons .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , we have obtained the crossover from this incoherent behavior to the marginally coherent one in which both the linewidth and the excitation energy are proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "we found that this crossover behavior depends on the nature of the disorder . comparing with experimental results in which the marginally coherent behavior is dominant ,",
    "we have concluded that in real materials the spatially - correlated or mesoscopic - scale disorder is relevant compared to the local or atomic - scale disorder .",
    "all the above anomalous features are obtained in the lowest order of the @xmath0 expansion , @xmath68 .",
    "up to @xmath68 , we have shown that the double exchange model with disorder is effectively mapped to the heisenberg spin model with random exchange couplings . in the absence of the disorder",
    ", the corresponding heisenberg model has the uniform nearest neighbor exchanges , whose spin excitation spectrum shows the cosine dispersion .",
    "@xcite even in this pure case , in the higher order of @xmath0 , there are some deviations from this cosine dispersion such as the magnon bandwidth narrowing or the softening , and the broadening .",
    "@xcite however , these higher order corrections are known to be small near the hole concentration @xmath211 where we are interested in .",
    "@xcite moreover , the spin excitation anomalies we obtained here are the primary effects in the @xmath0 expansion compared to the higher - order corrections .",
    "therefore , we believe that our results are relevant to understand the anomalous spin excitations in real compounds .",
    "our results give a comprehensive understanding of the systematic changes of the spin excitation spectrum in the _ a_-site substituted manganites .",
    "moreover , the disorder explains well the experimental facts which can not be understood only by the bandwidth control , such as the rapid decrease of @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite therefore , we conclude that the disorder plays an important role in the _",
    "a_-site substitution of the ionic radius control in cmr manganites .",
    "we comment on the relevance of another additional couplings due to the influence of the multicritical phenomena . as decreasing the ionic size of the _",
    "a_-site atoms , finally the system becomes the charge - ordered insulator with the orbital and lattice orderings , the ferromagnetic insulator , the antiferromagnetic insulator , or the spin glass insulator .",
    "@xcite the phase diagram often shows the multicritical behavior .",
    "these phase transitions might not be explained by the disorder alone . in the close vicinity of the multicritical phase boundary",
    ", we expect large fluctuations and critical enhancement of additional couplings , which possibly accelerate the suppression of @xmath10 and enhance the anomalies in the spin excitation spectrum . however , the multicritical phenomena is essentially the first order phase transition .",
    "hence , far from the phase boundary , for instance , in lcmo compounds , we believe that these additional couplings becomes irrelevant and the disorder plays a major role .",
