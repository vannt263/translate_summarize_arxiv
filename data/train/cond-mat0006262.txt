    "there are many physical examples in which a short - ranged tendency to order is opposed by a long - range frustrating interactions : in diblock copolymers formed by two mutually incompatible polymer chains attached to each other , the repulsive short - range forces between the two types of components tend to induce phase separation of the melt , but total segregation is forbidden by the covalent bonds that link the subchains together .",
    "a microphase separation transition occurs instead at low enough temperature , and the system then forms phases with a periodically modulation of structures rich in one component or the other , such as lamellar , hexagonal , or cubic phases@xcite . in a similar way , self - assembly in water - oil - surfactant mixtures results from the competition between the short - range tendency of water and oil to phase separate and the stoichiometric constraints generated by the presence of surfactant molecules , constraints that act as the electroneutrality condition in a system of charged particles @xcite .",
    "the same kind of physics also arises in quite different fields .",
    "for instance , stripe formation in doped antiferromagnets like cuprates has been ascribed to a frustrated electronic phase separation , by which a strong local tendency of the holes to phase separate into a hole - rich `` metallic '' phase and a hole - poor antiferromagnetic phase is prohibited by the long - range coulombic repulsion between the holes @xcite .",
    "a last example is provided by the structural or topological frustration in glass - forming liquids : the dramatic slowing down of the relaxation that leads to the glass formation has been interpreted as resulting from the presence of frustration - limited domains whose formation comes from the inability of the locally preferred arrangement of the molecules in the liquid to tile space periodically@xcite ; topological frustration may also lead to low - temperature defect - ordered phases such as the frank - kasper @xcite phases in bimetallic systems .    a coarse - grained description of the above mentioned situations involves lattice or continuum models with competing short - range and coulombic interactions .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study the phase diagram of such a model , namely the coulomb frustrated ising ferromagnet in which ising spins placed on a 3-dimensional cubic lattice interact via both nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic couplings and long - range coulomb - like antiferromagnetic terms .",
    "the model is introduced in more detail in section  [ sec : coulombfrus ] and its ground states as a function of the frustration parameter , i.e. of the ratio of the antiferromagnetic coupling strength over the ferromagnetic one , is studied in section  [ sec : phase - diagram - at ] . in section  [ sec : mean - field - theory ] , we investigate the finite - temperature phase diagram in the mean - field approximation . finally , the effect of the long - range nature of the frustrating forces , when comparing the phase behavior of the prototypical model with competing , but short - ranged interactions , the axial next - nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model@xcite , as well as the limitations of the mean - field approach are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where , @xmath1 are the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling strengths , @xmath2 are ising spin variables placed on the sites of a three - dimensional cubic lattice , @xmath3 denotes a sum restricted to nearest neighbors , @xmath4 is the vector joining sites i and j , and @xmath5 represents a coulomb - like interaction term with @xmath6when @xmath7.(in all the paper , the lattice spacing is taken as the unit length ) .",
    "in addition to considering the true coulombic term , @xmath8 , we have also studied , for mathematical convenience in the analytical treatment , an expression of @xmath5 in terms of the lattice green s function that satisfies the poisson equation on the three - dimensional cubic lattice . in the latter case , @xmath9 is then simply given , up to a multiplying factor of @xmath10 , as the inverse fourier transform of the inverse lattice laplacian , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of lattice sites and the sum over @xmath13 is restricted to the first brillouin zone . for large",
    "@xmath14 the lattice green s function behaves as @xmath15 so that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) has the proper asymptotic behavior . in practice , even at the next - neighbor distance , the difference between the true coulombic form and eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is very small @xcite .",
    "one has however to be careful about two points .",
    "the first one is that the @xmath5 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) has a nonzero , finite value at @xmath16 , @xmath17 , a value that must of course be excluded when considering the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) has been omitted in previous papers @xcite , but it leads only to very small corrections when the parameter @xmath18 is small . ] for instance , eq .",

    "the second point worth mentioning is that the @xmath26 expressed in terms of the lattice green s function has the same discrete symmetry as the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction whereas the true coulombic form has continuous rotational symmetry instead .",
    "the consequences are negligible for the ground - state and mean - field analyses , but may become important for the finite - temperature behavior of the system in other approximations@xcite .",
    "in the absence of the antiferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath27 ) the model reduces to the standard ising ferromagnet , and the ground state of the system is obtained when all spins are aligned in a ferromagnetic state .",
    "oppositely , when the ferromagnetic interaction is set to zero ( @xmath28 ) , the model is equivalent to a coulomb lattice gas and the ground - state of the system is a nel antiferromagnetic state .",
    "when @xmath29 , the coulombic interaction prevents the existence of a ferromagnetic phase , and in the thermodynamic limit , the total magnetization ( charge ) is constrained to be zero .",
    "instead , phases with modulated order , i.e. , with periodic patterns of `` up '' and `` down '' spins subject to the constraint of zero magnetization , are formed .",
    "we have studied these phases both analytically with the long - range interactions modeled by the lattice green s function and numerically with the true coulombic form .    for small values of the frustration parameter @xmath18 , the ground state consists of lamellar phases in which parallel planes of ferromagnetically aligned spins form a periodic structure along the orthogonal direction .",
    "the system in such state can mapped onto a finite one - dimensional system of length @xmath30 where @xmath23 denotes the width of the lamellae@xcite .",
    "the short - range ferromagnetic contribution to the energy per spin of a lamellar phase can be readily calculated , and one gets @xmath31    the coulombic energy due to the long - range competing forces can be calculated in reciprocal space by using the expression in terms of the inverse lattice laplacian ( see section  [ sec : coulombfrus ] ) . for a lamellar phase of period @xmath30",

    "correspondingly , the lattice fourier transform of the ising spin variable , @xmath34 , where n is the total number of lattice site , has its modulus given by @xmath35 one finds that the sum rule @xmath36 is properly satisfied and that the coulombic energy per site , @xmath37 , is equal to @xmath38\\\\ & = & q\\left[\\frac{\\pi m^2}{6}+\\pi\\left(\\frac{1 } { 3}-2v(0)\\right)\\right ] \\label{eq:9}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in appendix  [ sec : calc - coul - energy ] , we show that the same expression for the coulombic energy is obtained when performing the calculation in real space with an effective one - dimensional potential , this latter includes a convergence factor that helps handling conditionally convergent sums appearing as a result of the long - range nature of the forces and that is taken to zero at the end of the calculation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above calculation in reciprocal space implicitly assumes that the contribution from the @xmath39 term is zero ; physically , this means that the periodic system is embedded by a medium with infinite dielectric constant .",
    "( for a more detailed discussion , see ref@xcite . ) since for simulations on ionic systems , a similar choice is generally adopted@xcite , both numerical and analytical calculations for our model have been performed using such metallic boundary conditions .",

    "( the plot for the true coulombic potential is very similar . )",
    "the slope of each straight line corresponds to the coulombic energy and the intercept with the y - axis corresponds to the short - range ferromagnetic energy . for a given frustration parameter @xmath18 , the ground state is given by the straight - line that has the smallest energy . when @xmath41 , the ground state consists of lamellar phases whose period becomes larger and larger and whose range of stability decreases .",
    "the values of @xmath42 corresponding to transitions between two successive ground - state structures are obtained by solving the equation @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath18 goes to zero , @xmath23 is asymptotically given by @xmath44 a behavior that is analogous to that observed for lamellar phases of diblock copolymer systems at low temperature in the so - called strong segregation limit@xcite .",
    "note that for a large width @xmath23 , the difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and the value obtained fro the true coulombic term is only weakly varying with @xmath23 and can be taken as a constant , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) provides also a very accurate estimate both for the sequence of lamellar phases and for the transition values of @xmath42 for the true coulombic potential .",
    "when @xmath18 increases , the period of the lamellar phases decreases until one reaches @xmath45 for @xmath46 . for a region of the frustration parameter between @xmath47 and @xmath48 ,",
    "this lamellar phase is then the most stable phase . in a narrow interval between @xmath49 and @xmath50",

    "the stable phase is @xmath55 .",
    "note that tubular phases of type @xmath56 with both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are never stable .",
    "for @xmath59 , the ground state is a @xmath60 tube . in another interval @xmath61",
    ", the system looses translational invariance in the third direction , and one observes a cascade of `` parallepipedic '' phases @xmath62 , with @xmath63 decreasing as the frustration increases until @xmath64 . between @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,",
    "the stable phase is @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the ground state is the standard nel state @xmath69 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:3]a ) .",
    "it is noticeable that periodic structures of the type @xmath70 with @xmath71 and at least of the @xmath72 s finite always have higher energies than those of the sequences @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , whatever the value of the frustration parameter ( see appendix  [ sec : coul - energy - simple ] ) .",
    "the same analysis can be repeated with @xmath5 given by the true coulomb interaction .",
    "the exact same sequence of ground states as before is obtained , but the values of the frustration parameter at the transition points are somewhat shifted : for instance , the lamellar phase @xmath45 is the most stable phase when @xmath76 , the cascade of `` tubular '' phases @xmath77 occurs around @xmath78 , and @xmath55 is stable for @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) .",
    "the cascade of `` orthorhombic '' phases @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , appears around @xmath82 ( see fig .  [",

    "it is worth mentioning that the counterparts of the lamellar , tubular , and orthorhombic phases in diblock copolymer systems@xcite ( systems that are described at a coarse - grained level by the scalar field theory associated with the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) are the lamellar , columnar , and cubic phases , respectively .    in the region of stability of the lamellar phases , we have also investigated if more complex structures involving several one - dimensional modulations of ferromagnetically ordered layers could be present and if multiphase transition points at which more than simply two phases coexist could occur . for both questions ,",
    "the answer is negative . as an example , we give in appendix  [ sec : mix ] the analytical expressions for the energy of the mixed lamellar phases that are formed by mixing lamellae of width @xmath45 and lamellae of width @xmath84 with some given periodic modulation .",
    "the simplest of such phases , that following the notation used by fisher and selke in their study of the axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model@xcite we denote @xmath85 , consists of a periodic repetition of a fundamental pattern formed by a succession of @xmath86 lamellae of width @xmath87 followed by @xmath88 lamellae of width @xmath89 .",
    "( when @xmath90 , one recovers the simple lamellar phase of width @xmath89 , denoted @xmath91 , and when @xmath92 , one recovers the simple lamellar phase of width @xmath87 , denoted @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is easy to check that such mixed lamellar phases are never stable at zero temperature . in particular , they have a ( strictly ) higher energy than the pure lamellar phases at the zero - temperature transition point between the @xmath93 and the @xmath91 phases , at @xmath94 , so that this latter is a simple two - phase coexistence point .",
    "this conclusion remains unchanged when one considers even more complex mixed lamellar phases , such as @xmath95 , with @xmath96 integers for @xmath97 , whose fundamental period is formed by @xmath98 @xmath99 layer lamellae followed by @xmath100 @xmath101 layer lamellae , then by @xmath102 @xmath99 layer lamellae , and by @xmath103 @xmath101 layer lamellae , etc  , two successive lamellae being composed of spins of opposite signs .",
    "we have also studied one - dimensional quasi - crystalline arrangements of lamellae : by using binary substitution rules,@xcite we have built quasi - periodic structures by iteration , but we have always found ( numerically ) that their energy is higher than that of the pure lamellar phases .",
    "note finally that from the calculation of the energy of the mixed lamellar phases at zero temperature , one can also study the change of energy induced by adding defects in the pure lamellar phase @xmath91 .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sec : energy - defect-2 ] , adding defects always cost energy , the dominant effect being the increase in the short - range energy .",
    "the same analysis , leading to similar conclusion , can be repeated for the whole range @xmath104 over which lamellar phases are favored .",
    "to describe phases with a spatial modulation of the magnetization , we consider a local mean - field approximation . if @xmath105 denotes the local magnetization at site @xmath106 and @xmath107 its lattice fourier transform , the mean - field free energy @xmath108 is given by : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and the effective field on site @xmath106 , @xmath111 , is equal to @xmath112 , or in fourier transformed space , @xmath113    minimization of the free energy with respect to the local magnetizations leads to the self - consistent set of equations : @xmath114 for each lattice site .",

    "the fact that spin models with competing interactions can give rise to complex spatially modulated phases has been known for several decades .",
    "the annni model is one of the simplest and best - studied such system , in which ising spin variables situated on a lattice are coupled via nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interactions in ( @xmath205)-dimensional layers orthogonal to , say , the @xmath172 axis and via next - nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions along the @xmath172 axis@xcite .",
    "the major additional ingredient that is present in the coulomb frustrated ising ferromagnet and not is the previously studied models is the long - range nature of the competing antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "it is then worth reviewing some of the differences between the phase behavior of the three - dimensional coulomb frustrated ferromagnet and that of the three - dimensional annni and related models@xcite .",
    "first , the long @xmath206 range of the frustrating interaction forbids ferromagnetic ordering for any nonzero value of the frustration parameter @xmath124 , and , as a result , there is no lifshitz point@xcite in the model .",
    "secondly , there is no highly degenerate multiphase point at zero temperature ; this is in contrast with the annni model that possesses an infinitely degenerate multiphase point at zero temperature , a point from which springs an infinite number of distinct commensurate modulated phases@xcite .",
    "thirdly , the phase diagram of the coulomb frustrated ising ferromagnet , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , displays an infinite number of distinct flowers of complex spatially modulated phases that emerge from zero - temperature two - phase coexistence points , the extent of the flowers in @xmath150 phase diagram decreasing as the frustration parameter decreases .",
    "the long range of the antiferromagnetic interaction in the coulomb frustrated ferromagnet also brings about additional limitations on the mean - field approach . on general grounds",
    ", one can expect the mean - field description to reproduce the topology of the phase diagram correctly , but to become increasingly inaccurate as one approaches the transition line , both from below and from above , because it overlooks the role of fluctuations . in the present case ,",
    "the fluctuations have a major effect on the transition line : as argued by brazovskii@xcite on the basis of a self - consistent hartree treatment of a field - theoretical model analogous to the coulomb frustrated ising ferromagnet , and confirmed by monte carlo simulations@xcite , the fluctuations drive the order - disorder transition from second to first - order .",
    "the mean - field approach is thus questionable in the vicinity of the transition line ( which is why it may not be worth pursuing the search for devil s staircases as was done for the annni model@xcite ) .",
