    "a detection of signatures of primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) in the cosmic microwave background was claimed by the bicep2 experiment in 2014  @xcite .",
    "but this was shown to be likely caused by interstellar dust soon thereafter @xcite , and the search for true signatures of primordial gws is still ongoing .",
    "the detection of the gw signatures , if confirmed , would gain the greatest importance , among other things , from its link to cosmic inflation : primordial gws are seen as the smoking gun for the big bang  expansion . according to the inflation theory , the early universe experienced an extreme burst of expansion , which lasted a tiny fraction of a second , but smoothed out irregularities  inhomogeneities , anisotropies and the curvature of space , and made the universe appear homogeneous and isotropic  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that inflationary models of the early universe most likely lead to a multiverse  linde - guth .",
    "one such model is eternal inflation  @xcite : it proposes that many bubbles of spacetime individually nucleate and grow inside an ever - expanding background multiverse .",
    "the nucleation and growth of such bubbles can be modeled by a coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton , a type of quantum transition between two classically disconnected vacua at different energies ; the higher energy ( false vacuum ) , the lower energy ( true vacuum )  @xcite . a scalar field",
    "initially in the false vacuum state may tunnel quantum mechanically to the true vacuum state .",
    "this nucleates bubbles of the true vacuum ( new phase ) inside of the false vacuum ( old phase ) background ; through a first - order phase transition .",
    "these bubbles then expand and collide with each other .",
    "the mechanism of bubble collisions can be effectively modeled by the cdl instanton : as bubbles continue to collide repeatedly , the scalar field transitions back and forth repeatedly between the false vacuum and the true vacuum , eventually settling down in the true vacuum as the collision process is gradually terminated .    from the viewpoints of physical cosmology , bubble collisions and gws emitted from the collisions are interesting in the following contexts : ( 1 ) our primordial inflation would be completed by a second - order ( not by a first - order ) phase transition .",
    "however , there is a possibility that some weaker inflation could occur after the primordial inflation ; for example , thermal inflation  @xcite .",
    "it is quite probable that the thermal inflation is completed by a first - order phase transition , and therefore bubble collisions could take place through a cdl instanton .",
    "then there would be some signatures of bubble collisions , which would presumably be carried via gws @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) suppose that we live in a single large true vacuum bubble and that the boundary of our bubble would collide with another bubble that is located outside our observable universe @xcite .",
    "then there would exist some signatures of bubble collisions and these could be carried via gws . for scenario",
    "( 1 ) , the mechanism of bubble collision - gw emission should be modeled stochastically .",
    "however , for scenario ( 2 ) , the mechanism can be well approximated by a two - bubble collision model .",
    "there were numerous studies about bubble collisions and gws emitted from the collisions . among others , hawking _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and wu  wu studied the mechanism of the collision of two bubbles using the thin - wall approximation .",
    "johnson _ et al_.  @xcite and hwang _",
    "et al_.  @xcite investigated the collision of two bubbles in full general relativity via numerical computations .",
    "et al_. @xcite computed the gw spectrum resulting from two - bubble collisions in first - order phase transitions in flat spacetime using numerical simulations .",
    "et al_.  @xcite developed a model for the bubble velocity power spectrum to calculate analytically the gw spectrum generated by two - bubble collisions in first - order phase transitions in flat spacetime .",
    "in this paper , we focus on collisions of two equal - sized bubbles and compute gws emitted from the collisions in _ time domain_. largely , our analysis proceeds in two steps through sections  [ geometry ] and [ gw ] . in section  [ geometry ] , we study the mechanism of bubble collisions by means of a real scalar field and a quartic potential of this field , building the simplest possible model for a cdl instanton .",
    "einstein equations and a scalar field equation are derived for this system and are solved simultaneously for the full general relativistic treatment of the collision dynamics .",
    "et al_.  @xcite is closely reviewed for this purpose . in section  [ gw ] , using the scalar field model from section  geometry , we compute gws from the bubble collisions in a straightforward manner . in the quadrupole approximation , time - domain gravitational waveforms are directly obtained by integrating the energy - momentum tensors over the volume of the wave sources , where the energy - momentum tensors are expressed in terms of the scalar field , the local geometry and the potential ; therefore , containing all necessary information about the bubble collisions .",
    "part of computational results from ref .",
    "@xcite is recycled here to build the energy - momentum tensors . in parallel with the scalar field solutions in section  [ geometry ] , which have been obtained with various false vacuum field values  @xcite , we present gravitational waveforms emitted during ( i ) the initial - to - intermediate stage of strong collisions and ( ii ) the final stage of weak collisions :",
    "the former is obtained numerically , in _ full general relativity _ and the latter analytically , in the flat spacetime approximation . the thin - wall and quadrupole approximations are assumed to simplify our analysis and the next - to - leading order corrections beyond these approximations are disregarded . however , the approximations serve our purpose well : we aim to provide _ qualitative _ illustrations of the time - domain gravitational waveforms from the bubble collisions , which will be useful for constructing the templates for observation in the future .",
