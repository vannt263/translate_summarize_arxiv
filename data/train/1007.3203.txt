    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) consist of electrons and positrons accelerated by the pulsar wind termination shocks , giving rise to bright x - ray synchrotron emission from young pwne with ages up to several kyr .",
    "recent x - ray observations have shown the presence of the extended pwne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the pulsars with the age of up to @xmath010 kyr",
    ". however , we still do not know how the pwne evolve when they become older than the energy - loss time scales of electrons , and whether the accelerated electrons can escape the pwne or not .",
    "understanding the electron / positron escape process is important , since pulsars and pwne may be an important source of cosmic ray electrons and positrons @xcite , as recently suggested by pamela @xcite , atic @xcite , ppb - bets @xcite , fermi @xcite , and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite .    recently , the galactic plane survey by h.e.s.s .",
    "cherenkov telescopes has revealed about 50 very - high - energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the search for the counterparts in other wavelengths is ongoing .",
    "in fact , about a half of such vhe gamma - ray sources without any counterparts are now categorized as pwne , because possibly associated old x - ray pulsars are found later .",
    "hence these sources are keys to understand the pwn evolution and how the accelerated particles escape from the system .",
    "however , the problem is that such old pwne are rather faint in x - rays as opposed to in vhe gamma - rays @xcite . as the pwne ages",
    ", the x - ray emission becomes rapidly fainter , while the vhe gamma - ray luminosity keeps constant .",
    "previous x - ray observations did not have enough sensitivity to detect the probable faint nebulae .",
    "we thus need deep x - ray observations with low background to understand their x - ray properties .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite has carried out deep follow - ups for these sources to search for possible x - ray counterparts .",
    "actually , @xcite found a largely extended nebula from psr  b1823 - 13 associated with hess  j1825@xmath2137 , which could not be detected with _",
    "@xcite or _ xmm - newton _ @xcite observations .",
    "psr  j1809@xmath21917 is also in the same case with _",
    "@xcite and _ suzaku _ @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will make a systematic study of x - ray structure of such old pwne .",
    "the xis has a low and stable background , and is ideal for observing faint and extended sources like our targets .",
    "we selected the xis deep observations of the 3 pwne with vhe gamma - ray counterparts ( hess  j1825@xmath2137 , hess  j1809 - 193 , hess  j1718@xmath2385 ) and pulsars with known characteristic age ( @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 period and period derivative , respectively ) .",
    "for comparison , we also added a sample of five younger pulsars with vhe gamma - rays that have been observed with _",
    "chandra_. vela is not used in this paper although it is a well known pwn with tev emission , since it is too extended to cover by one or a few pointings of current x - ray observatories .",
    "table  [ tab : result ] lists the observational details and physical parameters of our samples , which cover most of the pwne with known periods and period derivatives , distances , and archival deep x - ray observations .",
    "our sample set covers the pwn candidates with ages in the range of @xmath0kyr up to @xmath0100  kyr .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows x - ray images above 2  kev of our sample : we did not use the photons below 2  kev to avoid possible contamination of thermal x - rays from the surrounding supernova remnants .",
    "all images are correct for exposure and vignetting . as can be seen , for the whole sample low surface brightness x - ray emission is detected from an extended region .",
    "this is the first discovery of low surface brightness , extended x - ray emission from pwne as old as  100 kyr . in order to measure the extent systematically , we made projected profiles using the rectangular regions shown in fig.[fig : image ] , and fitted these with a 1-d gaussian plus a constant background model to derive the typical size of the region , using the sigma of the gaussian ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we did not use the central pulsar region from the fitting to avoid their influence . as shown in fig.[fig : profiles ] , a gaussian profile provides a reasonable approximation for the surface brightness profiles .",
    "we defined the source size as 3 times of the @xmath6 in the gaussian fit .",
    "this is the value given in tab.[tab : result ] the best - fit parameters converted to the physical size are also shown in tab.[tab : result ] .",
    "the errors include both the statistical errors as given by the fits , and distance uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution ] shows the correlation between the characteristic ages of the host pulsars and the x - ray sizes of the pwne .",
    "it shows that the extent of the x - ray emission increases with @xmath7 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.72 .",
    "the pwne are not spherical , and as a result the derived sizes depend on the direction of profiles .",
    "however , the uncertainty is smaller than one order , and the correlation can not be removed with this effect .",
    "if we assume that the pwn age is equal to @xmath7 , fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] indicates that the x - ray emitting regions of pwne keep expanding up to @xmath0100  kyr .",
    "psr  b1706@xmath244 is recently detected in vhe gamma - rays @xcite , and it has largely extended x - ray emission @xcite . however , no x - ray observation covered the entire emission , and we could not measure the extension .",
    "there are some other pwne with known large extended x - ray nebulae , such as psr  j1016@xmath25857 @xcite and psr  j2021 + 3651 @xcite , from which no detection is reported in the vhe gamma - ray band .",
    "a rough estimation of their extent and comparing it to their pulsar characteristic ages , are consistent with the correlation that we find , even though these pulsars are younger than those in our sample . however , the sizes of these pwne are somewhat more uncertain , since these pwne are not fully covered by current x - ray observations .",
    "nevertheless , it suggests that the correlation between pwne x - ray extent and characteristic ages is not only valid for vhe gamma - ray emitting pwne , but also valid for pwne in general .",
    "we serendipitously found , for the first time , that the x - ray size of the pwne keeps increasing up to @xmath0100  kyr . in this section",
    ", we consider what makes such x - ray evolution of pwne .",
    "the energy loss time scale of the electrons emitting synchrotron x - rays with characteristic energy @xmath8 can be estimated as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic field strength . in the case of young pwne such as crab and vela",
    ", the magnetic field strength may be around 100  @xmath1 g  the equipartition magnetic field strength for these pwne is measured to be 60300  @xmath1 g @xcite .",
    "suppose that the x - ray emitting electrons are supplied by the wind termination shock , which has the radius of much less than @xmath01  pc @xcite .",
    "then , if the old pwne had similar magnetic field strength of about 100  @xmath1 g , their x - ray size would be much smaller than observed because the synchrotron cooling time scale of such electrons would be much smaller than @xmath0 kyr .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the observed correlation between the x - ray size and @xmath7 , the magnetic field strength inside the pwne must decrease with time .",
    "if the average magnetic field strength decays below 1  @xmath1 g for old pwne , the electrons can survive enough to emit synchrotron x - rays with largely extended feature of @xmath11  pc .",
    "typically , the older is a pulsar , the smaller is its spin down luminosity .",
    "simultaneously the magnetic field in the pwne may decrease , as the magnetic field at the light cylinder decreases with time , or because the expansion of the pwne dillutes the magnetic field , as the pulsar wind expands .",
    "alternatively , if the electron / positron energy density decreases with time due to adiabatic expansion , and/or synchrotron cooling , and if the magnetic field remains in rough equipartition with the particle energy density , one also expects a decrease of the magnetic field with time .    according to the model of @xcite ,",
    "the electrons in pwne are advected outwards .",
    "the advection speed depends on the @xmath12 parameter , which is defined as the relative energy flux of magnetic field to the kinetic energy flux . for larger @xmath12 ,",
    "the advection speed is larger , and the electrons can escape faster . in the case of young pwne such as crab and msh  15@xmath252 , @xmath12 is estimated to be very small , @xmath00.0030.03 @xcite , although @xcite suggested larger value ( @xmath12= 0.010.13 ) .",
    "the largely extended nebula can be achieved if @xmath12 becomes one order of magnitude larger when the system becomes @xmath0100  kyr old .",
    "so far we only considered that the growth of the pwne is caused by advection from the expanding electron / positron plasma .",
    "however , one should also consider the possibility of electron / positron transport by diffusion . for",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath13 one can assume @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a parameter showing deviations from bohm diffusion ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "one can eliminate @xmath17 by substituting the typical relation between synchrotron photon energy and electron energy @xmath18  kev .",
    "these can be subsituted in the expression for the diffusion length , @xmath19 at time @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "this gives for the required magnetic field , given @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 this equation shows that in order for a pwn to reach a size of 13  pc in x - ray due to particle diffusion , a magnetic field is required of 9  @xmath1 g ( 42  @xmath1 g ) for @xmath16 ( @xmath24 ) . in principle",
    "the time , t , can be smaller than the age of the pulsar , which would correspond to a recent diffusion of the electrons , whereas the oldest electrons have already escaped .",
    "the estimated magnetic field strength are therefore upper - limits .",
    "these values are not unreasonable , but a more thorough study is required to definitely decide whether the large x - ray extents of the pwne in our sample are due to diffusion or advection .",
    "our result suggests that the accelerated electrons and positrons on the termination shocks can escape from the host pwn systems keeping with enough energy to emit synchrotron x - rays . together with the fact that the majority of vhe gamma - ray unidentified sources are newly discovered old pwne",
    ", they could be the main contributor of cosmic ray electrons and positrons .    finally , we like to point out that the large extents of the pwne of ages up to @xmath0100  kyrs is also surprising , because pwne in a snrs should be crushed by the reverse shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas our result shows no evidence for an influence by the reverse shock .",
