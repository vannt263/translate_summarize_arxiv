    "a real monoenergetic neutron source in the mev energy region is not feasible , therefore `` quasi - monoenergetic '' neutron sources are used in different applications . among such sources , the ones based on the @xmath0li(p ,",
    "n ) reaction are widespread .",
    "although this reaction was measured many times by different authors at several laboratories ( see reviews on available data in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the measured data do not cover continuously the whole incident proton energy region and the whole kinematics region of secondary neutrons . therefore evaluated nuclear data libraries are needed for the @xmath0li(p , n ) reaction , to be used in simulations with transport codes of the `` quasi - monoenergetic '' neutron production from thick lithium targets in every particular application .    in refs.@xcite , an endf - formated data library for incident protons with energies up to 150 mev was developed . in those papers , the important @xmath0li(p , n@xmath1 ) and @xmath0li(p , n@xmath2 )",
    "reactions were evaluated from the experimental data , with their angular distributions represented using lengendre polynomial expansions .",
    "the decay of the remaining reaction flux was estimated from gnash nuclear model calculations .",
    "this leads to the emission of lower - energy neutrons and other charged particles and gamma - rays from preequilibrium and compound nucleus decay processes .",
    "examples of the use of these data in representative applications by a radiation transport simulation with the code mcnpx @xcite are also presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more recently , our data library was used successfully by simakov et al . in mcnpx simulations to study the activation cross sections on bi , au , co , and nb targets bombarded with quasi - monoenergetic neutrons produced from the p+@xmath0li reaction at the npi / e cyclotron facility @xcite .",
    "however , we never tested ourselves the p+@xmath0li data library with the latest los alamos monte carlo transport code mcnp6 @xcite . to fill this gap , here we test the applicability of mcnp6 @xcite to simulate quasi - monoenergetic neutron sources from interactions of proton beams with energies below 150 mev on thick @xmath0li targets .",
    "we used in our study the neutron spectra measured recently by uwamino et al . from a 2 mm thick @xmath0li target bombarded with protons of 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 mev @xcite and took advantages of an mcnpx input file kindly sent to us by dr .",
    "simakov to simulate the geometry of our problem ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , that we modified later for our mcnp6 needs .",
    "as a step of mcnp6 verification and validation ( v&v ) , we have simulated the neutron spectra from our target consisting of a 2 mm thick @xmath0li foil , 8 mm thick c beam stopper , and al holder for the li foils ( see @xcite and fig . 1 for details ) running mcnp6 both in a sequential mode and in parallel , with mpi , while using our p+@xmath0li data library .",
    "as expected , all results obtained with mcnp6 run with mpi coincide with the ones calculated in a sequential mode . as additional steps of mcnp6 v&v",
    ", we have calculated all the studied neutron spectra also using the bertini+dresner @xcite and cem03.03 @xcite event generators of mcnp6 .",
    "all our results are presented in fig .",
    "2 . just as expected for such low energies of incident protons , we can see that neither the bertini+dresner @xcite nor the newer cem03.03 @xcite event generators can reproduce satisfactorily the measured neutron spectra from our @xmath0li target : the higher the incident energy the better the agreement , but the quasi - monoenergetic neutron peak is not reproduced well by the models even at 40 mev . at the same time , all the mcnp6 neutron spectra calculated using the p+@xmath0li data library agree well with the measured data , including in the region of the quasi - monoenergetic neutron peak of interest to our study , for all tested bombarding energies of the proton beam .",
    "we have tested the applicability of mcnp6 to simulate quasi - monoenergetic neutron sources from interactions of proton beams with energies below 150 mev on thick @xmath0li targets .",
    "neutron spectra at zero degrees from a 2-mm @xmath0li layer backed by a 12-mm carbon beam stopper in an al flange bombarded with protons of 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 mev have been calculated with mcnp6 using the recent los alamos data library as well as using the bertini+dresner and cem03.03 event generators .",
    "our results show that the models ( event generators ) do not do well in describing such reactions , while mcnp6 using the lanl data library simulates production of neutrons from p + @xmath0li in good agreement with the measured data , including the region of the quasi - monoenergetic neutron peak of interest to our work .",
