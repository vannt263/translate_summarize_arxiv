    "the anomalous temperature dependence of hall coefficient in organic conductor @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 under pressure @xcite has been an unresolved problem for a long time .",
    "the issue was recently clarified by tight - biding band structure calculations which point out that the origin of this anomalous behaviour is the existence of a zero gap state ( zgs ) due to the presence of dirac points ( between valence and conduction bands ) exactly at the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "indeed when dirac points appear at the fermi energy , then electrons and holes pockets eventually disappear resulting in a semimetal phase with a vanishing density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "further tight - binding calculations , based on diffraction data under pressure @xcite , have established the robustness of the zgs under pressure .",
    "this robustness relies on the stability of dirac points at the fermi energy which itself is attributed to the persistence of an inversion symmetry under pressure .",
    "the scenario of the zgs has allowed much progress in the understanding of the physical properties of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the conditions for the existence and stability of dirac points at the fermi energy are still not well understood .",
    "indeed compared to graphene that has only two atoms per unit cell , the simplest tight - binding model of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 conducting plane contains six electrons for four distinct molecules @xmath7 per unit cells and seven distinct nearest neighbor transfer energies between them .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian matrix @xmath5 associated to @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 is then of size @xmath4 thus preventing much analytical treatment as opposed to tight - binding model of graphene that leads to a @xmath8 bloch hamiltonian matrix which allows full analytical understanding of dirac point properties @xcite . as a consequence , much understanding of the existence and stability of dirac points in @xmath0 filled @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 conducting plane relies on numerical diagonalization of the @xmath4 bloch hamiltonian matrix @xmath5 .",
    "many numerical studies have clearly established the existence and stability of dirac points under varying pressure ( e.g. pressure effect is encoded in the value taken by the seven transfer energies ) .",
    "they have shown that dirac points move in the brillouin zone by varying pressure and can merge at time reversal points for some critical pressure such that the system is fully gapped above this critical pressure .",
    "further studies have also examined the role of onsite potentials either due to anions or hartree mean - field electron - electron interaction . as a result",
    "it was shown that when such potentials break inversion symmetry between molecules @xmath9 and @xmath10 this prevents the appearance of dirac points @xcite    apart from these numerics , recent analytical approaches have obtained interesting results . on the one hand , by neglecting some transfer energies one can built an effective @xmath8 bloch hamiltonian matrix with only four transfer energies .",
    "it has been shown that this effective model leads to the so called tilted dirac cones with very anisotropic velocities @xcite .",
    "more recently an exact mapping of the @xmath4 hamiltonian matrix to a @xmath8 effective matrix model was built @xcite .",
    "this @xmath8 effective model encodes the dirac points physics in a self - consistent manner , it is however not clear how to reconstruct from such a reduced @xmath8 matrix the physical properties that concern only the valence and conduction bands of the full @xmath4 hamiltonian matrix . on",
    "the other hand mori@xcite recently examined a simplified @xmath4 bloch hamiltonian matrix , constrained by inversion symmetry , in which he considers only _ interchains _ transfer energies @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and where transfer energies @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) along the stacking axis are neglected such that no direct @xmath15 and @xmath16 hopping are allowed .",
    "this model appears exactly solvable and allows full analytical understanding of the existence and stability conditions of dirac points and their @xmath17 space motion under pressure .",
    "despite all these numerical and analytical studies , the question of the origin of the stability of the dirac points in @xmath0 filled @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 conducting plane is still pending . is inversion symmetry necessary or only convenient ? how important is the sign and modulus of each transfer energies for the stability of dirac points ?",
    "answering these questions remains crucial , because once the dirac points are well established it is then possible to consider only the @xmath8 effective low energy model that describes the valence and conduction bands in the neighborhood of the dirac point .",
    "such low energy model allows then to examine the novel physical properties associated to the presence of zgs with tilted dirac cones @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present a novel method to examine the existence and stability of dirac points in @xmath0 filled @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 conducting plane .",
    "shortly said , our method allows to obtain analytical albeit complicated expressions of eigen energy bands of the full @xmath4 bloch hamiltonian matrix @xmath5 in the presence of the seven transfer energies @xmath11 and @xmath13",
    ". however we show that to characterized the properties of dirac points between valence and conduction bands it is sufficient to study the properties of an alternative quantity @xmath18 that has a simpler analytical expression . we stress that equivalent quantities could be defined to study contact points between other neighboring bands as it was exemplified in a recent numerical study @xcite . using this quantity @xmath18",
    "we can then examine thoroughly the role played by the different transfer energies on the stability of dirac points and discuss the importance of inversion symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we setup the notations and present in more details the tight - binding model and associated bloch hamiltonian matrix of @xmath0 filled @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 conducting plane .",
    "we also present the different steps to derivate formal analytical expressions of eigen energy bands . in section iii as a first application of the method , we reconsider the simplified case of mori in which transfer energies @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) along the stacking axis are neglected . we explain how to generalize mori s result to system without inversion symmetry .",
    "we find that the absence of inversion symmetry is not detrimental to the existence and stability of dirac points .",
    "a possible explanation of this unexpected stability is the existence of a chiral symmetry which appears because the system becomes bipartite when the transfer energies @xmath13 are absent . in section",
    "iv we consider the full model with the seven transfer energies .",
    "we first introduce the alternative quantity @xmath18 . using this quantity @xmath18",

    "a key properties of these @xmath1-organic material is that these transfer energies can vary with the applied pressure @xmath31 .",

    ". we can rewrite @xmath51 where the @xmath52 matrix @xmath5 reads as @xmath53 with each matrix element given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "a key property of the matrix elements is that the modulus of each of them has a monotonous dependency in either @xmath56 $ ] for @xmath57 or @xmath58 $ ] for @xmath59 . as examples",
    "@xmath60 is a linear function of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 $ ] ) and @xmath63 is a linear function of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 $ ] ) .",
    "we denote @xmath66 , @xmath12 the four eigen energies ( bands ) obtained by diagonalizing matrix @xmath5 at a given @xmath17 with @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 is @xmath0 filled we call @xmath68 valence band and @xmath69 conduction band even though there might be some band overlap . in this framework , by varying @xmath17 over the whole brillouin zone one can explore the possibility of dirac point by searching for position @xmath70 around which the gap between valence band @xmath68 and conduction band @xmath69 vanishes linearly such that @xmath71 . in most previous works ,",
    "all this procedure is achieved through numerical diagonalization of matrix @xmath5 and until now it has prevented a clear understanding of role of the different transfer energies and of inversion symmetry on the existence and stability of dirac points .",
    "we now explain how one can go further with analytics and derivate formal analytical albeit complicated expressions for energy bands . as we already pointed out in the introduction we are not really going to use these expressions",
    ", nevertheless the formal derivation appears quite instructive and moreover it allows us to reach equations ( [ bcd ] ) and ( [ cubic ] ) which are the starting points of the analysis of dirac points properties presented in sections iii and iv .    to start with , we remind that @xmath66 is a root of @xmath72 with @xmath73 where coefficients @xmath74 are given by    @xmath75    note that @xmath76 for any @xmath77 while the sign of @xmath78 and @xmath79 depends on @xmath77 .",
    "the matrix @xmath80 is traceless and then we have @xmath81 . owing to this property",

    "the second step consists to relate @xmath87 to the three coefficients @xmath74 : @xmath88 using relations ( [ bcd ] ) , the third step consists to verify that the three quantities @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 are the three roots of the cubic polynomial @xmath93 given by @xmath94 from this point , using standard formula ( appendix a ) we can find the explicit form of the roots @xmath95 as function of coefficients @xmath74 and then obtain the expressions of the three quantities @xmath87 as @xmath96 , and @xmath97,@xmath98 for @xmath99 ( e.g @xmath100 ) .",

    "interestingly we obtain generalized conditions in cases where inversion symmetry is absent .    in section",
    "iv we discuss the general case of finite transfer energies along stacking @xmath29-axis @xmath105 ( e.g @xmath106 ) .",
    "in that situation the expressions of @xmath87 are too involved therefore we introduce an alternative quantity @xmath107 and derive an explicit condition on @xmath74 for the existence of a contact point at a position @xmath70 .",

    "<S> we reexamine the existence and stability conditions of dirac points between valence and conduction bands of @xmath0 filled @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 conducting plane . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the usual nearest neigbhor tight binding model with the seven transfer energies that depend on the applied pressure . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the four distinct molecules ( a , a , b , c ) per unit cell of the bravais lattice , the corresponding bloch hamiltonian is a @xmath4 matrix @xmath5 for each wave vector @xmath6 of the brillouin zone . in most previous works </S>",
    "<S> the study of dirac points was achieved through direct numerical diagonalization of matrix @xmath5 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we develop a novel analytical approach which allows to analyze the existence and stability conditions of dirac points from the knowledge of their merging properties at time reversal points . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> we can discuss thoroughly the role of each transfer integrals and demonstrate that inversion symmetry is convenient but not necessary . </S>"
