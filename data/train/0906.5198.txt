    "another interesting question arises when there is only a single @xmath18-brane @xmath202 , where @xmath3 is a fixed , connected submanifold of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the corresponding @xmath16-category would be an @xmath16-algebra .",
    "here it turns out that for poincar duality reasons it is more appropriate to consider hochschild cohomology .",
    "the question described in the introduction , regarding the relationship between these hochschild cohomology algebras and the chas - sullivan algebra structure on @xmath10 , was based on the idea that string topology , even in this  one @xmath18-brane \" setting should fit into costello s picture of a universal open - closed tcft .",
    "in particular the calculations described below verify that for a large class of submanifolds @xmath46 , the full subcategory of @xmath1 consisting of the single object @xmath3 still yields the full closed state space of string topology , @xmath203    an important idea that runs throughout the proofs of these statements is that of a  derived \" form of poincar duality .",
    "namely , instead of the classical setting where one has coefficients given by modules over the group ring @xmath204 $ ] , we need a version of poincar duality that applies to modules over the differential graded algebra @xmath62 . to be precise ,",
    "what we mean by @xmath62 is the dga corresponding to the @xmath205-module spectrum @xmath206 via the equivalence of @xcite , where here @xmath50 denotes a model of the based loop space which is a topological group , and @xmath205 is the eilenberg - maclane spectrum for the field @xmath2 .    more specifically , recall that for any connected space @xmath207 , one has natural eilenberg - moore equivalences , @xmath208 ( here and below we will suppress grading . )",
    "written on the level of chain complexes there are equivalences , @xmath209 the later equivalence being one of dga s .",
    "now suppose @xmath0 is a connected , closed , oriented manifold ( or more generally , a poincar duality space ) . then the fundamental class , @xmath210 \\in   tor_{c_*(\\omega m ) } ( k , k ) \\cong h_*(m ; k)$ ] is represented by a fundamental cycle @xmath210 \\in k \\otimes^l_{c_*(\\omega m ) } k$ ] .",
    "classical poincar duality can be viewed as saying that capping induces a chain homotopy equivalence , @xmath211 :   rhom_{c_*(\\omega m ) } ( k , k )   { \\xrightarrow}{\\simeq } k \\otimes^l_{c_*(\\omega m ) } k.\\ ] ] it follows from the work of dwyer - greenlees - iyengar @xcite and klein @xcite that indeed one has a chain equivalence , @xmath212 :   rhom_{c_*(\\omega m ) } ( k , p )   { \\xrightarrow}{\\simeq } k \\otimes^l_{c_*(\\omega m ) } p,\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is _ any differential graded module over @xmath62 , that is bounded below .",
    "this is the  derived \" form of poincar duality that we need . _",
    "this interpretation of the results of @xcite and @xcite was used by malm in @xcite to study other aspects of string topology in this algebraic setting .    in what follows",
    "we sketch how this duality is used to construct the string topology category @xmath1 .",
    "given a connected , closed , oriented submanifold @xmath46 , let @xmath213 be the homotopy fiber . because of our connectivity hypotheses , one can view @xmath213 as @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is a fixed basepoint .",
    "we then have homotopy fibrations , @xmath216 ( in the last sequence , we choose a specific equivalence between the homotopy fiber of @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the choice is not canonical since we are not assuming that the inclusion @xmath55 preserves basepoints .",
    "this choice , however , is not used in our definition of the string topology category below . )    from these fibrations we can regard @xmath219 as a @xmath42-module over @xmath62 . once again , what we mean by @xmath219 is the @xmath42-module corresponding to the module spectrum @xmath220 .",
    "a key observation is that the compactness of @xmath3 and @xmath0 impose a strong condition on @xmath219 . specifically , we have the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath0 be finite - dimensional connected complexes with @xmath221 , and @xmath222 the homotopy fiber of the inclusion @xmath223 .",
    "then @xmath224 is small as a @xmath225-module .",
    "there are equivalences @xmath226 ( the second of these equivalences depends on the choice of equivalence of @xmath218 and the homotopy fiber of @xmath217 above . ) furthermore , we have homotopy cartesian squares @xmath227 therefore an _ eilenberg - moore _ argument yields a chain homotopy equivalence @xmath228 we can then make the following equivalences : @xmath229    we remind the reader that in the above equivalences all gradings ( and grading shifts ) are suppressed .",
    "further , it is worth emphasizing that it is poincar duality for @xmath4 that is used in these equivalences .    by using cofibrant - fibrant replacements of @xmath230 ( for which we use the standard model structure on @xmath42-modules over @xmath62 , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we can regard the derived homomorphism complexes as possessing a strict composition pairing .",
    "this observation gives rise to the definition of the string topology category .",
    "[ definition ] let @xmath0 be a connected , closed , oriented manifold with fixed basepoint @xmath215 .",
    "the string topology category @xmath1 has as    1 .",
    "objects the pairs @xmath231 , where @xmath3 is a connected , closed , oriented submanifold @xmath46 and @xmath213 is a specific choice of model for the homotopy fiber of @xmath223 with an action of @xmath50 .",
    "morphisms from @xmath4 to @xmath5 the derived homomorphism complex @xmath232 computed via functorial cofibrant - fibrant replacement of @xmath233 .    in other words , @xmath1 is the full subcategory of the @xmath42-category of differential graded modules over @xmath62 with objects cofibrant - fibrant replacements of @xmath234 for @xmath46 a submanifold as above .",
    "we remark that this derived form of poincar duality has another interpretation , namely one of a derived and non - commutative analogue of local serre duality for a regular , @xmath27-dimensional local ring @xmath235 . for any @xmath235-module @xmath236",
    ", we have the isomorphism @xmath237.\\ ] ] indeed , the gorenstein property says that @xmath238 and ( [ iso ] ) follows by standard homological algebra arguments and finiteness of @xmath2 over @xmath235 ( a consequence of regularity ) .",
    "the gorenstein property of the dga @xmath239 follows from poincar duality for @xmath3 and from the eilenberg - moore isomorphism @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the cohomology - coefficient system over @xmath3 defined by the fibrewise chains of the path fibration @xmath242 .",
    "indeed , poincar duality identifies the last cohomology with the total homology of the based path space , shifted up by @xmath27 , and we conclude that the right - hand complex is isomorphic to @xmath2 placed in degree @xmath27 .",
    "regularity of @xmath243 ( i.e. , finiteness of @xmath2 as a @xmath244-module ) is a consequence of the fact that @xmath3 has a finite cell decomposition .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of the relationship of the gorenstein condition to topological duality phenomena .",
    "finally , we point out that this generalized notion of poincar duality ( i.e. , with coefficients being modules over @xmath62 ) is at the heart of the argument that shows that composition in this category realizes the string topology compositions on the level of homology , @xmath245    curiously , this is most easily seen on the level of spectra .",
    "as will be shown in @xcite , if one runs through the above chain level argument on the level of module spectra over ring spectra , then one proves a twisted form of atiyah duality : @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the thom spectrum of the virtual bundle @xmath248 obtained by pulling back the negative tangent bundle @xmath249 over @xmath7 via the map @xmath250 that evaluates a path at its starting point .",
    "we view this as a twisted form of atiyah duality , because in the case when @xmath251 , then @xmath252 , and @xmath253 .",
    "we then have the traditional form of atiyah duality : @xmath254 here @xmath255 is the sphere spectrum , and @xmath256 is the spanier - whitehead dual of @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of twisted atiyah duality has been studied before in several contexts .",
    "for example , in @xcite , it was studied in the context of  poincar duality with coefficients in a fibered spectrum \" .",
    "it also appeared , in a slightly different context in @xcite , and in @xcite . in the classical setting , as well as these  twisted settings \" , it is fairly standard to see that the composition pairings correspond , up to homotopy , to pairings constructed on the level of thom spectra via the pontrjagin - thom construction ( see @xcite for this type of argument ) .",
    "however the pontrjagin - thom constructions are precisely how the string topology pairings are defined , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when one passes to chains , this implies that the composition of morphisms in the string topology category , correspond , on the level of homology , to the open - closed string topology operations .",
    "details of these arguments will appear in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 is simply - connected , we have a useful `` dual '' model of @xmath1 which follows from the following alternative description of the path spaces @xmath257 , another consequence of the generalized form of poincar duality . here",
    "we regard @xmath53 as an @xmath258-algebra and we are relying on the existence of a model structures on modules over an @xmath258-algebra @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed , simply connected manifold , and @xmath259 connected , oriented , closed submanifolds . then there is a chain equivalence , @xmath260 equivalently , there is a chain equivalence @xmath261    furthermore , it turns out that the multiplicative structures are compatible with the equivalences of the previous lemma and as a consequence , we obtain the following comparison result . recall that when comparing enriched categories , the correct notion of equivalence is given by considering enriched functors which induce equivalences on mapping objects and an underlying equivalence of `` homotopy categories '' ( e.g. , defined by passing to @xmath262 for @xmath42-categories or components for spectral categories )",
    ". we will refer to such equivalences in general as dwyer - kan equivalences , although in special cases they tend to have specific names ( e.g. , quasi - equivalence of @xmath42-categories ) .    for @xmath0",
    "a closed , simply connected manifold , there is a zigzag of dwyer - kan equivalences between the string topology category @xmath1 and the full subcategory of the category of @xmath53- submodules , with objects cofibrant - fibrant replacements ( as @xmath53-modules ) of the cochains @xmath263 for @xmath46 a connected , oriented submanifold .",
    "the hochschild homology statement in theorem  [ bct1 ] follows from an identification @xmath264 .",
    "this in turn is obtained as a straightforward consequence of the general theory developed in @xcite ; the thick closure of @xmath1 inside the category of @xmath62-modules is the entire category of finite @xmath62-modules .",
    "this is essentially a morita equivalence result . when one restricts to a single object @xmath3 , ( the  one - brane \" situation ) , the endomorphism algebra is equivalent to @xmath9 . in this case analysis of the hochschild ( co)homology requires a more involved morita theory .",
    "this is because it is definitely not the case in general that there is a morita equivalence between the category of @xmath265-modules and the category of @xmath9-modules .",
    "here the situation is a kind of koszul duality , and so whereas the hochschild homologies of the path algebras vary as @xmath3 varies ( explicit descriptions will be given in @xcite ) , it is reasonable to expect that the hochschild cohomologies should coincide . to approach these calculations ,",
    "the following basic principle is used in @xcite :    let @xmath235 and @xmath236 be two differential graded algebras over a field @xmath2 , and suppose there exist @xmath266 ( differential graded ) modules satisfying the following equivalences : @xmath267 then their hochschild cohomologies are isomorphic , @xmath268    using this result , given a submanifold @xmath46 , one considers @xmath269 the @xmath266 modules are both given by @xmath270 .",
    "we already know that @xmath271 , for any @xmath46 , when @xmath0 is simply connected .",
    "the hochschild cohomology calculations are then reduced to a question about `` double centralizers '' : @xmath272 is equivalent to @xmath273 if there is an equivalence @xmath274 keller @xcite has shown a more general formulation of the sufficiency of a double - centralizer condition for the equivalence of hochschild cohomology for @xmath42-categories ( and note that there is also a generalization of his theorem to @xmath275 cohomology and spectral categories using the technology of @xcite ) .",
    "the question of the existence of such equivalences can be studied using the generalized morita theory of dwyer , greenlees , and iyengar @xcite , and leads to the following characterization :    [ doublecent ] assume @xmath0 is simply connected . then for any @xmath46 in @xmath14 , @xmath276 here @xmath277 is the bousfield localization of @xmath62 with respect to the homology theory @xmath278 , defined on the category of @xmath62-modules given by @xmath279 ( note that this is best regarded as a completion process , despite the terminology of localization ; we will refer to local objects as @xmath219-complete . )",
    "an immediate corollary is that the double centralizer property holds if and only if @xmath225 is @xmath280-complete .",
    "therefore , we are immediately led to study the following question : for which submanifolds @xmath46 is @xmath62 in fact @xmath219-complete",
    "? counterexamples ( obtained in consultation with bill dwyer ) exist that suggest that this does not always hold .",
    "however , we can show the result in certain useful special cases .",
    "in particular , we know that @xmath62 is @xmath219-complete in the following cases :    1 .",
    "the inclusion map @xmath55 is null homotopic .",
    "this implies that @xmath281 , and @xmath282 .",
    "the inclusion @xmath55 is the inclusion of the fiber of a fibration @xmath58 .",
    "more generally there is a sequence of inclusions , @xmath283 where each @xmath60 is the inclusion of the fiber of a fibration @xmath284    these results also have consequences for certain module categories related to the rings we are considering .",
    "denote by @xmath285 the endomorphism ring @xmath286 , which as noted above provides a strictly multiplicative model of @xmath9 .",
    "[ module ] when the double centralizer condition holds , the following categories of modules are dwyer - kan equivalent :    1 .   the thick subcategory of @xmath53-modules generated by @xmath53 ( i.e. , the perfect modules ) .",
    "2 .   the thick subcategory of @xmath62-modules generated by the trivial module @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   the thick subcategory of @xmath285-modules generated by @xmath287 . notice that this latter module is equivalent to @xmath263 .",
    "note that the equivalence of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) was shown in @xcite ; their methods extend to provide the comparison to ( 3 ) .",
    "these equivalences of categories of modules are relevant to the floer theory of compact lagrangians in the cotangent bundle @xmath13 , as we discuss in section 3 .    finally , we point out that there are spectrum level analogues of the above theorems ( with essentially similar proofs ) , in particular theorem [ bct1 ] as stated in the introduction .",
    "[ spectrum ] there is a string topology category , enriched over spectra , which by abuse of notation we still refer to as @xmath1 , whose objects again are determined by elements of @xmath29 .",
    "the morphism spectrum between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the analogous mapping spectrum @xmath288 and has the homotopy type of @xmath247 , the thom spectrum of the virtual bundle @xmath248 , where @xmath289 is the tangent bundle of @xmath4 , pulled back over @xmath290 via the evaluation map that takes a path @xmath291 to its initial point @xmath292 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath275 of this category is the suspension spectrum of the free loop space ( with a disjoint basepoint ) , @xmath293    moreover , the analogue of the above hochschild cohomology statement is the following :    [ onebranespec ] assume that @xmath0 is a simply connected , closed manifold .",
    "then given any connected , closed , oriented submanifold @xmath46 for which the double - centralizer condition holds , then the thom spectrum @xmath294 is a ring spectrum , and its topological hochschild cohomology is given by @xmath295 and the equivalence is one of ring spectra .",
    "this section is speculative , regarding the possible relationships between the string topology category @xmath1 , and the fukaya category of the cotangent bundle @xmath13 .",
    "the fukaya category is an @xmath16- category associated to a symplectic manifold @xmath296 . here",
    "@xmath297 is a symplectic @xmath298-form .",
    "recall that for any smooth @xmath27-manifold @xmath299 , @xmath13 has the structure of an _ exact symplectic manifold .",
    "that is , it has a symplectic @xmath298-form @xmath300 which is exact . in the case",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is the liouville one - form defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath303 be the projection map .",
    "let @xmath304 , and @xmath305 .",
    "then @xmath306 is the given by the composition , @xmath307 there has been a considerable amount of work comparing the symplectic topology of @xmath13 with the string topology of @xmath0 .",
    "this relationship begins with a theorem of viterbo @xcite , that the symplectic floer homology is isomorphic to the homology of the free loop space , @xmath308 the symplectic floer homology is computed via a morse - type complex associated to the ( possibly perturbed )  symplectic action functional \" , @xmath309 .",
    "the perturbation is via a choice of hamiltonian , and so long as the hamiltonian grows at least quadratically near infinity , the symplectic floer homology is described by the above isomorphism .",
    "the precise relationship between the floer theory of the symplectic action functional @xmath310 and morse theory on @xmath8 was studied in great detail by abbondandolo and schwarz in @xcite . in particular",
    "they were able to show that a  pair of pants \" ( or  quantum \" ) product construction in @xmath311 corresponds under this isomorphism to a morse - theoretic analogue of the chas - sullivan product in @xmath10 . in @xcite",
    "this product was shown to agree with the chas - sullivan construction . _    the objects of the fukaya category @xmath312 are exact , lagrangian submanifolds @xmath313 . the morphisms are the  lagrangian intersection floer cochains \" , @xmath314 .",
    "these floer cochain groups are also a morse type cochain complex associated to a functional on the path space , @xmath315 if @xmath316 and @xmath317 intersect transversally , then the critical points are the intersection points ( viewed as constant paths ) , and the coboundary homomorphisms are computed by counting holomorphic disks with prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "of course if @xmath318 were actually a morse function , satisfying the palais - smale convergence conditions , then these complexes would compute @xmath319 .",
    "one knows that this morse condition is _ not satisfied , but there are examples , when this homological consequence is nonetheless satisfied .",
    "namely , let @xmath46 be an oriented , closed submanifold .",
    "let @xmath320 be the conormal bundle .",
    "that is , for @xmath321 , @xmath322 consists of those cotangent vectors which vanish on the subspace @xmath323 .",
    "notice that the conormal bundle is always an @xmath27-dimensional submanifold of the @xmath324-dimensional manifold @xmath13 .",
    "it is a standard fact that the conormal bundle @xmath325 is a ( noncompact ) lagrangian submanifold of @xmath13 .",
    "notice that for any two closed , oriented submanifolds @xmath259 the following path spaces in the cotangent bundle and in the base manifold @xmath0 are homotopy equivalent : @xmath326 the following was recently proven by abbondandalo , portaluri , and schwarz @xcite : _",
    "let @xmath329 be the full subcategory of the fukaya category generated by conormal bundles of closed , connected , submanifolds of @xmath0 .",
    "then there is a dwyer - kan equivalence with the string topology category , @xmath330    1 .   in this conjecture one probably wants to study the  wrapped \" fukaya category as defined by fukaya , seidel , and smith in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath331 , its conormal bundle is a cotangent fiber , @xmath332 .",
    "abouzaid @xcite has recently described the @xmath16 relationship between the floer cochains @xmath333 and the chains of the based loop space , @xmath62 .",
    "there are other potential relationships between the fukaya category and the string topology category as well .",
    "for example , fukaya , seidel , and smith @xcite as well as nadler @xcite building on work of nadler and zaslow @xcite showed that when @xmath0 is simply connected , the fukaya category @xmath334 generated by compact , exact lagrangians with maslov index zero , has a fully faithful embedding into the derived category of modules over the floer cochains , @xmath335 where @xmath0 is viewed as a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath13 as the zero section .",
    "furthermore , one knows that the floer cohomology , @xmath336 is isomorphic to @xmath337 , and recently abouzaid @xcite proved that @xmath338 as @xmath16- differential graded algebras .",
    "so @xmath334 can be viewed as a sub-@xmath16-category of the derived category of @xmath53-modules .",
    "when @xmath0 is simply connected , recall that the string topology category @xmath1 can also be viewed as a subcategory of the category of @xmath53- modules . from nadler s work we see that the relationship between the compact fukaya category @xmath334 should be equivalent to the  one - brane \" string topology category , @xmath339 , which is the full subcategory of @xmath1 where the only @xmath18-brane is the entire manifold itself .",
    "this category , in turn , generates the derived category of perfect @xmath340-modules .",
    "the significance of this potential relationship is amplified when one considers recent work of hopkins and lurie @xcite classifying  extended \" topological conformal field theories .",
    "this can be viewed as a direct generalization of the work of moore - segal , and of costello discussed above . in their classification scheme ,",
    "such a field theory is determined by an appropriately defined ",
    "calabi - yau \" category enriched over chain complexes . the category of perfect @xmath53-modules is such a category .",
    "moreover generalized morita theory implies that this category is dwyer - kan equivalent to the category of @xmath2-finite @xmath62-modules .",
    "thus these categories should determine an extended field theory , which should correspond to string topology .",
    "on the other hand , by the above remarks , the fukaya category @xmath341 should also determine a field theory , presumably the  symplectic field theory \" of eliashberg , givental , and hofer @xcite applied to @xmath13 .",
    "one can therefore speculate that this line of reasoning may produce an equivalence of the symplectic field theory of @xmath13 , and of the string topology of @xmath0 .",
    "there is evidence that such an equivalence may exist , for example the work of cielebak and latchev @xcite .",
    "pursuing this relationship using the hopkins - lurie classification scheme could lead to a very satisfying understanding of the deep connections between these two important theories .",
