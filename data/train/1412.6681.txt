    "the higgs boson discovery @xcite , is the first out of all the pivotal _ experimental _ particle physics discoveries which relies , to such a large extent , on the _ theoretical _ calculations of the standard model ( sm ) background .",
    "given its importance for the future experimental program in high energy physics , it should be of utmost interest to keep exposing the theoretical background calculations to a broad spectrum of experimental and theoretical stress tests , no matter how widely this discovery is acclaimed .",
    "majority of the sm background processes leading to higgs - like signatures have already been identified and extensively studied experimentally , using the data extrapolation driven techniques , and theoretically , using the existing monte carlo generators of sm processes .",
    "the basic two questions which have motivated our studies presented in this and in two other papers @xcite are :    1 .   is the list of the background sources complete ? 2 .",
    "are various approximations inherent in the monte carlo generators , used in the determination of the experimentally irreducible background , controlled to the claimed precision ?    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite , we have concentrated our attention on the double drell  yan process ( ddyp ) , considered to be negligible in the atlas and cms analyses .",
    "we have demonstrated , using a simplified model of ddyp , the appearance of a peak in the four - lepton invariant mass , @xmath4 , distribution which mimics the @xmath5 gev higgs signal in its @xmath6 decay channel .",
    "higgs - like \" peak is generated by the interplay of a steeply falling @xmath4 distribution and the kinematical threshold effect driven by the experimental cuts on the outgoing leptons variables .",
    "the cuts influencing the background peak position are similar in the atlas and cms analyses and are therefore reflected in similar peak positions within a @xmath7 gev interval .",
    "the coincidence of the higgs peak and the ddyp peak could be accidental .",
    "it is , however remarkable , that once the absolute normalisation of the ddyp contribution is fixed using the lhc @xmath8 cross - section data @xcite , the ddyp process could provide an alternative explanation of the higgs - like excesses of the events both in the @xmath6 and in the @xmath9 channels .",
    "the claim of the atlas and cms collaborations that ddyp can be neglected as a potentially alarming source of background was based on the assumption of uncorrelated : ( 1 ) longitudinal momentum , ( 2 ) transverse position , ( 3 ) flavour , ( 4 ) charge and ( 5 ) spin of the partons taking part in ddyp , and on the assumption of the process independent value of @xmath10 , governing the strength of double - parton scattering ( dps ) processes @xcite . the above , in our view unjustified , assumptions lead to a significant underestimation of the contribution of ddyp to the higgs searches background . as we argued in @xcite , its contribution",
    "must be , given the lack of the adequate theoretical calculations , determined experimentally , e.g.  by using experimental methods proposed therein and in @xcite .",
    "in the current paper we study another potentially important contribution to the higgs searches background , which has not been entirely taken into account in the atlas and cms papers @xcite , namely the processes of emission and subsequent internal conversion of off - shell ( virtual ) photons radiated by quarks and leptons participating in the production and leptonic decays of @xmath11 bosons .",
    "examples of the feynman diagrams corresponding to these processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ ps - diagrams ] .",
    "production processes contributing to the higgs searches background .",
    "the final - state leptons are produced by the decays of the @xmath11 boson and by the internal conversions of virtual photons , @xmath12 .",
    "the virtual photons can be emitted at an arbitrary stage of the parton shower.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the matrix element ( me ) contribution to these processes  for the case of _ quark  antiquark annihilations _ ",
    "was considered in the atlas and the cms analyses @xcite and evaluated using the powheg - box / zz next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) me generator ( powheg ) @xcite . the powheg quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation contribution to the higgs searches background in @xmath13 channel was found to be the dominant one @xcite .",
    "the _ first _ question which , in our view , must be addressed is if the contribution of the _ quark  gluon scattering processes _ can be neglected .",
    "these processes are suppressed by an @xmath14 factor .",
    "however , this suppression may be to a great extent neutralised by a large value of the ratio of the gluon to quark parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the @xmath15-domain which is pertinent to the higgs signal extraction .",

    "gluon scattering diagrams for @xmath11 pair production are shown in fig .",
    "[ qg - diagrams ] .",
    "pair production in quark  antiquark and quark ",
    "gluon scattering.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the _ second _ question is whether the contribution of processes in which virtual photons are emitted by _",
    "parton showers _ ( ps ) , both for the quark  antiquark and quark  gluon collisions , can be neglected for the inclusive four - lepton analysis .",
    "the strength of this contribution increases with decreasing off - shellness of virtual photons proportionally to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the invariant mass of the four - lepton system and @xmath18 is the virtual photon mass @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the latter question , while the former one will be addressed in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "the  ps \" question can not , at present , be answered at nlo precision , because an appropriate nlo monte carlo generator producing interleaved qed and qcd parton showers , including the full set of the re - summed @xmath19 corrections to the inclusive production of vector bosons , does not exist .",
    "the studies presented in this paper are based on the leading - order ( lo ) pythia  8 event generator @xcite , which has inferior quality with respect to powheg in calculating the nlo me contribution to the four - lepton final state .",
    "however , virtual photon emissions by the initial and final state quarks and leptons are included in all stages of the qcd / qed - interleaved parton shower .",
    "the pythia ps description of the virtual photon emissions has never , to our best knowledge , been tested in the kinematical domain discussed in this paper .",
    "therefore , an evaluation of its precision is the prerequisite for its subsequent use in the studies of the higgs searches background .",
    "such an evaluation is presented in section [ calibration ] , following the introductory discussion of the background sources to the higgs searches in the four - lepton channel .",
    "this discussion is presented in section [ background ] . in section [ results ] the results of our calculations are presented .",
    "the proposal of an experimental test aiming to verify the importance of the qed / qcd ps contribution to the higgs - boson searches background is discussed in section [ verification ] .",
    "the dominant _ irreducible background _ contribution to the higgs boson searches in the @xmath20 decay channel arises from the direct production of ( @xmath21 ) pairs @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use the term @xmath22 for the opposite sign and same flavour lepton pair with its invariant mass higher or equal @xmath23 gev and the term @xmath24 for the pairs with in the remaining mass region .",

    "we focus our attention on the first two contributions .",
    "the amplitude level mechanism of the ( @xmath21 ) pair production can be represented as the drell  yan production of @xmath30 accompanied by the initial or final state radiation of @xmath12 , followed by its conversion into the opposite charge and same flavour lepton pair , but its contribution to the @xmath24 mass region is negligible . ] .",
    "the off - shell photons can be radiated both by the final state leptons coming from the @xmath31-boson decays , and by the initial and ( in the case of the quark ",
    "gluon processes ) final state quarks . at the cross - section level ,",
    "their origin can not be unambiguously identified and the corresponding interference terms as well as the interference terms arising , in the case of the 4@xmath32 and 4@xmath33 final states , from the presence of indistinguishable fermions must , in principle , be taken into account . however , for the higgs boson mass region discussed in this paper , the interference effects are expected to be small @xcite .    in the atlas and cms papers @xcite the irreducible background to the @xmath0 decay channel is claimed to be controlled , for the quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation contribution , within @xmath34@xmath35% accuracy .",
    "this uncertainty was estimated by varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales , and by varying pdfs within their uncertainty range .",
    "the missing contribution of the quark ",
    "gluon scattering processes and the missing ps contribution were not accounted for in the quoted above accuracy estimation .",
    "the event generator which was used in @xcite for the determination of the quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation background and its uncertainty was powheg @xcite .",
    "this me generator does not cover entirely the phase space of virtual photon emissions , in particular the region populated by virtual photons emitted at the  early stage \" of the ps development .",
    "as long as the region of @xmath36 gev is avoided in the higgs searches , such an approximation is claimed to be justified @xcite . for the searches reported in @xcite , which open the phase space towards smaller masses ,",
    "the validity of such a statement remains to be verified .",
    "the effect of the two approximations made in @xcite : ( 1 ) the missing contribution of the quark  gluon processes and ( 2 ) the missing ps contribution , even if expected to be small , and consequently not taken into account in the atlas and cms analyses , needs to be estimated to gain a full confidence in the claimed precision of the irreducible background level .",
    "it remains to be mentioned that the contribution of the quark ",
    "gluon scattering processes in which virtual photons are emitted in ps initiated by the final - state recoil quark may also influence the size of the _ reducible background _ contribution .",
    "the reducible background @xcite is dominated by @xmath37 events ( mostly @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) which give rise to the detector reconstructed objects faking the isolated lepton identification signatures .",
    "this background is detector and analysis method dependent .",
    "its size was estimated using data driven methods @xcite . in general , these methods define control regions to monitor the background level and subsequently extrapolate its magnitude to the signal region , based on the assumption that the @xmath38 and @xmath39 events are the sole background sources .",
    "the processes of radiation of virtual photons by the outgoing quarks ( so far not taken into account in the atlas and cms analyses ) produce isolated leptons already in the `` @xmath31 plus a single light - flavour jet '' events , as long as @xmath40 is large enough to sweep out the leptons outside of the recoil quark jet cone .",
    "inclusion of such a process could influence the shapes of the lepton track s  distance of the closest approach \" ( dca ) and the lepton candidate isolation criteria , leading to an underestimation of the reducible background level .",
    "this effects is expected to be significantly amplified in the kinematical region selected for the higgs bosons searches in which @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass of the @xmath43-quark .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the processes of radiation of large mass virtual photons are not generated by the standard versions of the ps generators used by the lhc experiments .",
    "the fully inclusive @xmath44 processes , including both the quark  antiquark and quark  gluon collisions , were generated for 8 tev proton ",
    "proton collisions using pythia  8.180 .",
    "only the leptonic decays were retained .",
    "the minimal mass of the @xmath44 boson was set to be @xmath23 gev .",
    "the minimal transverse momentum cut - off of virtual photons was equalised for the quark and lepton emissions to be @xmath45 gev for time - like showers and @xmath46 gev for space - like showers .",
    "both cuts are significantly lower than the invariant masses of the virtual photons studied in this paper , @xmath47  5 gev .",
    "the phase space for the generated virtual photon masses up to the value of @xmath48 gev was open .",
    "hadronisation processes , except for prompt decays , were switched off , and the default cteq  5l pdfs @xcite were used .    for the calibration of the pythia generator precision in describing the processes of large - mass virtual photon emissions by parton showers , we analyse first",
    "its performance for the processes of @xmath31-boson decays into four leptons , @xmath49 .",
    "technically , we select the region of @xmath50 where , for @xmath47  5 gev , a large majority ( more than @xmath51 ) of virtual photons are emitted by the leptons coming from the @xmath31-boson decays . this _",
    "region is particularly well suited for testing how precisely the pythia ps recoil model mimics the exact me calculations .    throughout this paper",

    "the origin of the latter was traced back to the mother leptons and their four - momenta were added to the four - momenta of the mother leptons to form dressed leptons .",

    "the @xmath52 pair production events of powheg - box version 2129 were generated and analysed in our studies .",

    "we shall use only the algorithmic association of leptons to the @xmath22 and @xmath24 pairs , defined in section  [ calibration ] .",

    "the extension of the  leptonic calibration \" of the pythia precision to quark radiation processes is based on the assumption that the strength of the qcd confinement forces and the precise values of the quark masses , which , in principle , may lead to significant differences in photon emissions by leptons and quarks , become irrelevant for the process of highly virtual , @xmath70 , photon emissions . assuming its validity , quarks , except for the differences in the electric charges ,",
    "can be considered as equivalent emitters of highly virtual photons as leptons .",

    "these processes indeed can be neglected at such a precision level for the phase - space cuts applied in the higgs boson targeted searches @xcite .",
    "a measurement method tailored for pinning down the ps effects , of particular importance for searches of alternative / complementary mechanisms producing the excess of events in the 125 gev mass region , has been proposed .",
    "this method allows the ps effects to be established experimentally in the ps - sensitive @xmath102 gev mass region , where we predict the @xmath99@xmath100 excess of data with respect to the powheg background for the @xmath97 tev sample of the @xmath75 events collected at the lhc .",
    "the sensitivity to the ps effects is expected to increase in the the subsequent phase of the lhc operation and may become important already for the canonical phase - space cuts",
    ".    it would be advantageous if the corresponding experimental studies could be supported on the theoretical side by constructing a mc generator for the four - lepton production processes in which , on top of the powheg nlo qcd me calculations , the interleaved nlo qcd and qed parton showers ( including virtual photon emissions ) are incorporated .",
