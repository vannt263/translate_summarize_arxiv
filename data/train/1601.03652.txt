    "the role of clouds in brown dwarf ( bd ) and extra - solar giant planet ( egp ) atmospheres has been an intense subject of research for the past twenty years , since the first observations of these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while cloudy atmosphere models reproduce the observed reddening in infrared ( ir ) j - h and j - k colors @xcite , several problems remain unsolved :    * the driving mechanism of the cloud dynamics remains poorly understood .",
    "although convective overshooting has been proposed for such a mechanism @xcite , the low variability of l dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which points to a relatively steady process , seems incompatible with the transient nature of overshooting .",
    "furthermore , the change of regime in this mechanism and the sharpness in effective temperature of the lt transition , so in short the very physical nature of this transition remain so far unexplained . *",
    "neither the j band brightening nor the feh resurgence at the l / t transition are understood .",
    "although holes in the cloud cover can reproduce these features @xcite , @xcite recently showed that the variability of the spectrum is not compatible with holes but rather with height variations .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite is indeed that the explanation for the re - emergence of feh still remains to be found . *",
    "the absorption feature at 10 @xmath3 m is not well reproduced with the current cloud models .",
    "although some observations do suggest the presence of silicate dust @xcite , the absorption feature is not present in all observed spectra and , for the ones that display it ( e.g. 2m224 , 2m0036 , 2m1507 , and 2m2244 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cloud models can not reproduce _ both _ the nir reddening and the 10-@xmath3 m absorption . *",
    "signatures of cloud polarization expected from cloud models remain undetected @xcite . even though l dwarfs might not rotate fast enough nor have low enough surface gravity to be sufficiently oblate to produce detectable polarization @xcite , this lack of detection questions the cloud hypothesis .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the spectra and near - ir colors of t and y dwarfs can be reproduced without clouds if ( i ) non - equilibrium chemistry of nh@xmath2 is taken into account , and ( ii ) the temperature gradient in the atmospheres of t dwarfs is reduced . in this paper , we explore a similar mechanism for l dwarfs and hot egps , using denis - p 0255 and hr8799c , respectively , as typical templates , and show that these effects adequately reproduce both the feh resurgence and the j - band brightening at the l / t transition .",
    "we show that a physical process responsible for the temperature gradient reduction in l and t dwarf atmospheres is the chemical or ( compositional ) convection triggered by a thermo - chemical instability at the co / ch@xmath0 and n@xmath1/nh@xmath2 transitions .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications and the limitations of this scenario .",
    "we use the same setup as described in @xcite i.e. , a 1d spectral code atmo with correlated - k coefficients for the radiative transfer , developed and tested in @xcite , coupled to the chno - based chemical network of @xcite .",
    "we improved our chemical and opacity database with the inclusion of the feh molecule and used @xcite for the line list , @xcite broadening coefficients , and @xcite for the chemical equilibrium of feh . in @xcite , we applied the calculations to t dwarfs and showed that a reduced temperature gradient in the atmosphere , as reproduced with an effective adiabatic index ( @xmath4  1.2 - 1.3 ) lower than the equilibrium value ( @xmath4  1.3 - 1.4 ) correctly reproduces the observed spectra and the reddening in j - h colors , yielding a synthetic spectrum similar to the one with the inclusion of clouds @xcite .",
    "we have explored these effects on the egp hr8799c ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_hr8799c ] ) and the l dwarf denis - p 0255 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_d0255 ] ) . as seen in figures [ fig : spec_hr8799c ] and [ fig : spec_d0255 ] , the models reproduce the observed spectra very well provided that ( i ) we include non - equilibrium chemistry and quench co / ch@xmath0 ( i.e. prevent the formation of ch@xmath0 ) , ( ii ) we decrease the adiabatic index to @xmath4  1.05 in the lower part of their atmospheres .",
    "the only difference with the t - dwarf modeling of @xcite is that we modify the adiabatic index only within the layers corresponding to the emerging flux bands .",
    "the global effect of the modification of the adiabatic index along the l sequence and the l / t transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_lt ] , and the modified layers are indicated in the pressure / temperature ( pt ) profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] .",
    "the data for hr8799c are taken from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_hr8799c ] , the blue spectrum is the out - of - equilibrium model obtained with a value of the turbulent diffusion coefficient k@xmath5 = 10@xmath6 @xmath7s@xmath8 .",
    "such a high value is consistent with the convective velocities computed in the model for these low gravities .",
    "the 3.78-@xmath3 m flux is higher in our model , but ph@xmath2 opacity could be significant around 4 @xmath3 m and is not included in our models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our out - of - equilibrium cloudless model with a modified adiabatic index provides a better fit to the nir data between 1 and 2 @xmath3 m compared to the cloud models @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature , surface gravity and radius we derive are compatible with evolutionary models @xcite and suggest a lower - mass , younger object (  3 m@xmath9 at 10 m@xmath10 ) than previous studies .",
    "since we used a higher metallicity , however , different c / o ratios could also lead to a good fit with slightly different values of effective temperature , surface gravity and radius .",
    "these effects need to be investigated in more details in follow - up studies .",
    "the spectrum of denis - p 0255 was obtained from @xcite .",
    "this object is a typical late type l dwarf ( l8 ) which has a characteristic reddening in j - h and j - k. the model we used includes a zone with a modified adiabatic index @xmath11=  1.05 in the deep atmosphere . as a result , the atmospheric profile has cooler deep layers and hotter upper ones than the equilibrium atmosphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the fluxes in y and j bands are reduced and the ones in h and k bands are enhanced .",
    "the modeled spectrum shows that this effect adequately reproduces the main characteristics of the data , provided ch@xmath0 is still reduced compared to the equilibrium value ( with now a value k@xmath5 = 10@xmath12 @xmath7s@xmath8 , consistent , again , with the convective velocities computed in the model for these gravities ) .",
    "the effect is similar to what was inferred in @xcite for t dwarfs at the n@xmath1/nh@xmath2 transition .",
    "l dwarfs just require a lower value of the adiabatic index in order to produce a stronger reddening .",
    "pressure / temperature structures of our models along the l sequence ( t@xmath13=1600k to t@xmath13=1400k ) and along the l / t transition at constant effective temperature ( @xmath11=1.05 to @xmath11=1.2 ) . ]",
    "from our t - dwarf modeling in @xcite , it was unclear whether the need to use cooler deep atmospheric layers was due to a real effect ( fingering convection ) or was rather a way to mimic the effect of clouds .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_lt ] displays the evolution of the spectrum along the l sequence ( from t@xmath13 = 1600 k to 1400 k ) .",
    "as expected , we clearly see a weakening of the feh spectral signature as a function of decreasing effective temperature . the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_lt ] illustrates the evolution of the spectrum at constant t@xmath13 (= 1400 k ) along the l / t transition when varying the modified adiabatic index from a value @xmath11 = 1.05 , for l dwarfs , to @xmath11 = 1.2 - 1.3 , for early t dwarfs .",
    "observations @xcite indeed suggest that the l / t transition occurs at relatively constant effective temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_lt ] clearly shows that along this transition our models naturally yield a resurgence of the feh absorption feature and a brightening of the j band flux similar to what was found in observations .",
    "the l dwarf reddening is due to cooler deep atmospheric layers than the ones corresponding to a radiatively stable atmosphere , a consequence , as detailed in the next section , of the enhanced energy transport due to local chemical turbulence , triggered by the thermo - chemical instability .",
    "as one moves towards cooler atmospheres when transitioning towards t dwarfs , the instability vanishes .",
    "turbulent dissipation warms up the deep atmosphere , steepening the temperature gradient ( yielding a larger effective adiabatic index ) , increasing the feh abundance and the flux in these hotter layers , compared to the l - dwarf profile .",
    "this global effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] . along the l sequence ,",
    "the atmospheric profiles keep cooling down , notably in the deeper layers ( p @xmath14 1 bar ) , due to the smaller thermal gradient ( i.e. the smaller effective adiabatic index ) . along the l / t transition ,",
    "the deep layers warm up , yielding a steeper temperature gradient , while the upper layers keep cooling down .",
    "an alternative suggested scenario to explain the resurgence of feh and the j band brightening is holes in the cloud cover @xcite although it appears to be partly excluded by @xcite .",
    "we rather suggest that the proper explanation for these puzzling spectral behaviors is ( i ) cooler deep atmospheres for l dwarfs than obtained with cloudy atmospheres , the conventional explanation for the past 20 years , yielding the j - h and j - k reddening , and ( ii ) a warming up of the deep layers at the l - t transition , due to small - scale turbulent dissipation , which explains both the feh resurgence and the j band brightening .",
    "although we have a model that can reproduce all the observed effects , we need an explanation for the change in the modified adiabatic index and the transition from @xmath11 = 1.05 to 1.2 - 1.3 . in @xcite",
    ", we proposed that small scale  diffusive  turbulence , more efficient than radiative transport , induced by fingering convection triggered by thin dust condensation , would be responsible for the decrease of the temperature gradient .",
    "we revisit this scenario and rather suggest that the real culprit is the instability of carbon and nitrogen chemistry in bd and egp atmospheres . within the temperature range of interest , carbon is preferentially in form of co at high temperature and of ch@xmath0 at low temperature .",
    "similarly , nitrogen changes from n@xmath1 at high temperature to nh@xmath2 at low temperature .",
    "the net reactions for these transitions are : @xmath15 it is quite clear that the part of the atmosphere in the methane or ammonia dominant state will have a higher mean molecular weight than the corresponding co or n@xmath1 dominated one , since there are globally fewer molecules in these latter states . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known from chemical network studies that the chemistry for these transitions can be very slow @xcite .",
    "therefore , atmospheres with these chemical transitions can develop an instability similar in nature to fingering double diffusive convection , but with the chemical reactions themselves now playing the role played otherwise by molecular diffusion , leading to a thermo - chemical instability .",
    "the analogy is as follows : at the ch@xmath0/co transition , if a perturbation drives some ",
    "mixture down in the  co+3h@xmath1  ( warmer ) deeper layers , and if we are in the stable radiative part of the atmosphere , because of the slowness of the chemical reaction the mixture will stay in its methane - rich state and sink because of its higher molecular weight .",
    "the same process can happen at the n@xmath1/nh@xmath2 transition .",
    "the extent of the unstable zone can be estimated by using an extension of the ledoux criterion @xcite : @xmath16    we have replaced the usual molecular diffusion coefficient by @xmath17 with @xmath18 the timescale of the chemical reaction and @xmath19 the typical size of the unstable structures .",
    "we have computed the timescales for the reactions using the equations given by @xcite , and we assumed that the typical size of the unstable structures is 1% of the scale height ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion on the size of the fingers expected in the stellar context ) . in order to be conservative",
    ", we use an upper limit for @xmath20 , given by @xmath21 .",
    "the unstable regions are portrayed in the top panel of fig .",

    "other cmds with the nir bands y , j , h , and k give a similar good match between our models and the observations since , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_d0255 ] , the nir spectra are well reproduced .",
    "we also illustrate the transition from l to t with a model at constant effective temperature and an adiabatic index varying from 1.05 ( l ) to 1.25 ( t ) ( orange line in fig .  5 ) .",
    "this highlights the occurence of the j - band brightening in our ( cloudless ) 1d models , even though a detailed sequence based on consistent evolutionary models is needed to properly take into account the evolution of gravity , effective temperature and modified adiabatic index .",

    "in this paper , we show that :    * conditions characteristic of the atmospheres of l dwarfs favor the onset of a thermo - chemical instability at the co / ch@xmath0 transition , while conditions typical of t dwarf atmospheres yield the same instability at the n@xmath1/nh@xmath2 transition .",

    "such studies require non - trivial numerical explorations .",
    "although by no means providing a proof , several features bring support to the reality of this instability .",
    "first , its disappearance when the atmosphere becomes stable again ( according to condition [ eq : ledoux ] ) could explain the sharpness in effective temperature of the l / t transition .",
    "second , turbulent energy transport , triggered by the instability of the co / ch@xmath0 and n@xmath1/nh@xmath2 transitions , decreases the temperature gradient in the atmosphere , leading to the reddening of l and t dwarfs , respectively .",
    "third , the strength of the instability being intrinsically linked to the magnitude of the mean - molecular - weight gradient , the fact that the gradient associated to the co / ch@xmath0 transition is larger than the one at the n@xmath1/nh@xmath2 transition ( because of the c / n @xmath32 4 abundance ratio * ? ? ?",
    "* ) explains the stronger reddening for l dwarfs than for t dwarfs .",
    "fourth , the turbulence induced by co or temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere during the transition from co to ch4 at the l / t transition could explain the observed variability .",
    "thus the fluctuations observed by doppler imaging reflect the ones in co abundances or in temperature @xcite .",
    "given the coherence of this global picture , we conclude that clouds are not needed to explain the main characteristics of the emission spectra of bds and directly imaged egps .",
    "we emphasize that this does not imply an absence of clouds .",
    "given the possibility of many stable condensates , and the presence , according to the present scenario , of turbulent layers , these atmospheres very likely present some cloud cycles .",
    "furthermore , some observations , such as the absorption in the 10  @xmath3 m window ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest the presence of condensates .",
    "current cloud models , however , do not well reproduce this signature ( see * ? ? ? * ) , requiring a revision of the models in order to reproduce both this signature and the nir color reddening .",
    "not only does the present scenario completely change our present understanding ( and non understanding ) of bd and egp atmospheres , but , if correct , it shows that the same physical mechanism , namely chemical or fingering convection , induced by a thermo - chemical instability , would take place in environments as different as earth oceans @xcite , the earth core - mantle boundary @xcite , and exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres , nicely illustrating the universality of physical processes in nature .",
