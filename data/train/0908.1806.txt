    "actinide oxides play a dominant role in the nuclear fuel cycle .",
    "@xcite for many years , uranium dioxide has been the main fuel component in commercial nuclear reactors .",
    "the `` burning '' of uo@xmath0 results in considerable amounts of np and pu isotopes , as well as smaller quantities of minor actinides such as am , cm , bk and cf . in original , `` once through '' reactors , the highly radioactive waste that is produced resulted in very troublesome long time storage requirements ; particularly of pu .",
    "however , it was soon realized that the pu could be reprocessed from the spent fuel and used as alternative fuel in a new generation of reactors .",
    "the environmental and energy production issues apart , the fact that pu is obtained from the decommisioning of nuclear weapons is yet another important consideration concerning its use as nuclear fuel .",
    "a mixture of uo@xmath0 and puo@xmath0 , the so - called mixed oxide ( mox ) , where pu is blended with either natural or depleted uranium , constitutes the preferred , pu containing , fuel in existing nuclear reactors . lately , np , as well as the minor actinides that accumulate during nuclear reactor operation , are also being considered for reprocessing .",
    "@xcite once separated from the spent fuel , these actinides can either be incorporated in durable ceramic waste for safe long time storage ( and possible later recovery ) or transmuted from long - lived isotopes to less radiotoxic short - lived isotopes through irradiation , thus taking part in the fuel cycle and reducing the long term nuclear waste management problem .",
    "again oxides are being considered both with respect to the materials being used as fission / transmutation targets ( ao@xmath0 )  @xcite and for the direct storage in the shape of durable ceramic glasses ( ao@xmath0 , a@xmath0o@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite for example puo@xmath0 has long been the compound of choice for depositing pu in long time repositories , given the observed stability with respect to oxidation .",
    "@xcite    regarding their behaviour under both reactor operation and storage conditions , it is crucial to understand the thermochemistry , thermophysics , and materials science of the actinide compounds . given the toxicity of the materials involved , computer simulations , such as thermodynamic modelling  @xcite or , as in the present paper , electronic structure calculations can provide fundamental insights at a level not achieveable through experiment alone . here",
    "we wish to focus specifically on the @xmath5-electrons , their contribution to the groundstate electronic properties of the actinide oxides , the role they play with regards to stability towards oxidation , and their behaviour under ionic bonding conditions .",
    "when modelling the electronic structure of actinide materials , the most distinguishing feature is the increasing importance of correlations across the series from u to cf , as the nature of the @xmath5-electrons changes from delocalized in the early actinides to localized in the later actinides .",
    "@xcite electronic structure calculations , based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , do not take into account strong on - site correlations beyond the homogeneous electron gas , and therefore can not adequately describe the localized phase of actinide materials .",
    "thus the lsda ,  @xcite or even the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite ( which extends beyond the lsda by taking into account charge density gradients ) , wrongly predicts a metallic ground state for uo@xmath0 , puo@xmath0 and pu@xmath0o@xmath1 , although the equilibrium lattice parameters and cohesive properties are found to be in rather good agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite    a number of schemes have been developed that augment the standard bandstructure framework to include the effects of strong correlations on the electronic structure . in the lda+u approach  @xcite an effective coulomb parameter @xmath6 is introduced that separates the @xmath5-manifold into the upper and lower hubbard bands and removes @xmath5-degrees of freedom from the fermi level . the more advanced dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approach provides a description of the competing trends towards localization on the one hand and itineracy on the other hand by taking into account the local quantum fluctuations missing in the static lda+u treatment  @xcite ; albeit still at the cost of the introduction of the @xmath6-parameter .",
    "the hybrid density functional  @xcite theory implements an exchange - correlation functional where a fraction of the exact non - local exchange interaction from hartree - fock theory is mixed with the local or semi - local exchange energy of lsda or gga with the result that the troublesome effects of the known self - interaction error present in the standard lsda and gga calculations are reduced .",
    "the self - interaction corrected ( sic)-lsd approach  @xcite used in the current work removes the self - interaction error that occurs in the lsda , thereby leading to an improved description of the static coulomb correlations of the f - electrons .",
    "the self - interaction correction associates an energy gain with electron localization , which competes with the opposing trend of band formation , providing a dual picture of combined localized and band like @xmath5-electrons .",
    "the method is fully _ ab - initio _ as both kinds of electrons are treated on an equal footing , with no adjustable parameters .",
    "a comparative study of mno , involving sic - lsd , lda+u , and the hybrid functional methods , was published by kasinathan _",
    "et al._.  @xcite    the present paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we give a short introduction to the sic - lsd band structure method . in section iii , we present our sic - lsd results for the ground state properties of ( a ) the monoxides , ( b ) the sesquioxides , and ( c ) the dioxides where we also consider oxidation / reduction energies . in section iv , we give a summarizing discussion of the results , also concerning the relation between @xmath5-electron localization and oxidation by comparing to the lanthanide oxides .",
    "the conclusion of our paper is presented in section v.",
    "the lsd approximation to the exchange and correlation energy introduces an unphysical interaction of an electron with itself  @xcite which , although insignificant for extended band states , may lead to uncontrollable errors in the description of atomic - like localized states , for example the @xmath5-electrons in the later actinides .",
    "the sic - lsd method  @xcite corrects for this spurious self - interaction by adding to the lsd total energy functional an explicit energy contribution for an electron to localize . the resulting , orbital dependent , sic - lsd total energy functional has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8+v_{ext}[n ] \\\\         & + & e_{xc}^{lsd}[n_{\\uparrow},n_{\\downarrow } ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "e_{so}&=&\\sum_{\\alpha } ^{occ.}\\langle \\psi_{\\alpha } | \\xi(\\vec{r})\\vec{l}\\cdot\\vec{s } | \\psi_{\\alpha } \\rangle , \\\\",
    "\\delta e_{sic}&=&\\sum_{\\alpha } ^{occ.}\\delta _ { \\alpha } ^{sic}=\\sum_{\\alpha } ^{occ . }",
    "\\left \\ { u[n_{\\alpha}]+e_{xc}^{lsd}[n_{\\alpha } ] \\right \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the sums run over all occupied electron states @xmath9 . as usual , the lsd total energy functional ( 2 ) is decomposed into the kinetic energy , the hartree energy , the interaction energy with the atomic ions , and the exchange and correlation energy .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction ( 3 ) couples the band hamiltonian for the spin - up and spin - down channels , _",
    "i.e. _ a double secular problem must be solved .",
    "the spin - orbit parameter , @xmath10 in atomic rydberg units , is calculated from the self - consistent potential .",
    "the self - interaction energy ( 4 ) consists of the self - coulomb and self - exchange - correlation energies of the occupied orbitals @xmath9 with the orbital charge density @xmath11 .    for itinerant states",
    ", the self - interaction @xmath12 vanishes identically , while for localized ( atomic - like ) states @xmath12 may be appreciable .",
    "thus , the self - interaction correction constitutes a negative energy contribution gained by an electron upon localization , which competes with the band formation energy gained by the electron if allowed to delocalize and hybridize with the available conduction states .",
    "different localized / delocalized configurations are realized by assuming different numbers of localized states - here @xmath5-states on actinide - atom sites . for @xmath13- and @xmath14-states",
    ", @xmath12 is never competitive compared to the corresponding gain in band formation energy , and turns out to be positive . since the different localization scenarios constitute distinct local minima of the same energy functional , @xmath15 , their total energies may be compared and the global energy minimum then defines the ground state total energy _ and _ the valence configuration of the actinide - ion .",
    "this latter is defined as the integer number of electrons available for band formation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the atomic number , @xmath18 is the number of atomic core electrons , and @xmath19 is the number of sic - localized @xmath5-electrons . in the remainder of this paper we will be using two interchangeable nomenclatures , @xmath20 and a@xmath21 , to describe the configuration of the actinide ion , implying @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively",
    ". the total number of @xmath5-electrons may be larger than @xmath24 , since , in addition to the @xmath24 localized @xmath5-states , the band states also contribute to the total @xmath5-count on a given ion .",
    "note that our calculated valencies refer to the number of actinide electrons that contribute to bonding , and thus do not necessarily coincide with the nominal ( ionic ) valency of a compound : for puo@xmath0 for example , the pu@xmath2 would agree with an ionic picture , while the pu@xmath3 , and pu@xmath25 valency configurations would indicate more covalent behaviour .",
    "the sic - lsd approach is fully ab - initio , as both localized and delocalized states are expanded in the same set of basis functions and are , thus , treated on an equal footing . if no localized states are assumed , @xmath15 coincides with the conventional lsd functional , _",
    "i.e. _ , the kohn - sham minimum of the @xmath26 functional is also a local minimum of @xmath15 .",
    "given the total energy functional @xmath15 , the computational procedure is as for the lsd case , _",
    "i.e. _ minimization is accomplished by iteration until self - consistency . in the present work ,",
    "the electron wavefunctions are expanded in the linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) basis functions.@xcite the atomic spheres approximation ( asa ) is used , whereby the crystal volume is divided into slightly overlapping atom - centered spheres of a total volume equal to the actual volume .",
    "a known shortcoming of the asa is that different crystal structures have different degrees of overlap of the asa spheres resulting in substantial _ relative _ errors in the evaluation of the total energy . while this inhibits the comparison of energies of different crystal structures , when comparing the energies of different localization scenarios within the same crystal structure , the asa error is of minor influence . to improve the packing of the structure empty spheres",
    "have been introduced on high symmetry interstitial sites .",
    "there exists to date no convincing evidence that actinide oxides can form in the 1:1 stoichiometry . the experimental lattice parameters that we cite in table [ monoxidestable ] come from early reports on these compounds , and have so far not been confirmed .",
    "there have been no claims of bulk uo having ever been synthesized , and reports of an uo surface phase on u metal for low exposures to o,@xcite and uo thin films  @xcite could not be reproduced.@xcite it has been suggested that the observed thin films actually represent uranium oxynitrides ( un@xmath27o@xmath28 ) and oxycarbides ( uc@xmath27o@xmath28 ) , that form in the presence of n@xmath0 or c , and at low oxygen pressure.@xcite it has similarly been concluded that neither bulk npo , nor a corresponding npo surface phase will form.@xcite preparation of puo and amo ,  @xcite as well as possibly bko ,  @xcite has been neither substantiated , nor has it been dismissed .    .actinide monoxide data .",

    "the numbers indicate the ground state valency configurations that we have determined for a given compound .",
    "bold large letters are used to indicate those compounds that actually do exist in nature .",
    "it clearly emerges that only in those cases where the calculated ground state valency agrees with the nominal charge expected from an ideal ionic picture , does the corresponding oxide seem to form . in other words , those oxides where our calculations predict a valency configuration that is not in agreement with simple charge counting",
    "will not form naturally , and the excess / shortage of charge indicates that oxidized / reduced compound will be favoured instead .",
    "these trends emphasize the very ionic nature of bonding in the actinide oxides .",
    "it is interesting to compare these trends in oxidation of the actinides to the corresponding behaviour of the lanthanides.@xcite in the latter the 4@xmath5 electrons are overall more tightly bound to the lanthanide ion , which will favour lower oxidation numbers , compared to the spatially more extended 5@xmath5 electrons .",
    "the corresponding calculated valency configurations@xcite are shown in table [ review ] ( the lower 4 rows ) .",
    "the effect of the increased localization can be observed from the fact that a number of the lantanide monoxides actually exist , and it emerges from sic - lsd studies that especially for the half - filled and filled shell @xmath5-electron systems , i.e. for euo and ybo , the divalent configuration is energetically most favorable .",
    "all the lanthanide sesquioxides occur in nature , and the ground state configuration of the corresponding lanthanide ions is trivalent . even though the 4@xmath5-electrons tend to be more localized , the 3 + valency occurs naturally , which is in agreement with the trivalent configuration being the most favourable for the lanthanide metals . with respect to further oxidation to the tetravalent dioxide , only ceo@xmath0 , pro@xmath0 ( not shown in table [ review ] ) , and tbo@xmath0 , are found to occur naturally or ( for tbo@xmath0 ) under high o pressure , indicating that an additional @xmath5-electron only delocalizes in the very early lanthanides ,",
    "i.e. in ce and pr , where the @xmath5-electrons are less tightly bound , or in the middle of the series , where tetravalent tbo@xmath0 is favoured by the half - filled shell configuration.@xcite higher oxidation numbers than iv do not exist for the lanthanide oxides .",
    "again we observe that agreement between nominal charge and calculated ground state valency is required for a given compound to exist .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of actinide oxides and specifically monoxides , sesquioxides and dioxides , within the ab initio sic - lsd band structure method . by studying the oxidation and reduction reactions we have been able to conclude that the dioxides , from np onwards , are the most stable compounds among the studied actinide oxides .",
    "our study reveals a strong link between the preferred oxidation number and the degree of localization which is confirmed by comparing to the ground state configurations of the corresponding lanthanide oxides .",
    "the ionic nature of the actinide oxides is reflected in that only those compounds can form where the calculated ground state valency agrees with the nominal valency expected from a simple charge counting .",
