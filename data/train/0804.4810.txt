    "two of them correspond to forward - scattering processes whose couplings are denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 in standard @xmath34-ology notation.@xcite in addition , there are two backward - scattering processes which describe `` true '' backward scattering ( @xmath35-processes ) and umklapp scattering ( @xmath36-processes ) . due to the su(2 ) symmetry of the spin sector ,",

    "the renormalized fermi velocities are @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here and in the following , we use the lattice constant as the unit for the coupling constants as well as for the fermi velocities .",
    "the spin - charge coupling term with coupling constant @xmath49 describes umklapp scattering processes between electrons with the same spin .",
    "this interaction term formally occurs in the zeroth order of the expansion of the fermion fields with respect to the lattice constant .",
    "it is clear , however , that @xmath50 type processes can give contributions only for non - local interactions .",
    "moreover , this spin - charge coupling term breaks the global spin su(2 ) symmetry of the system .",
    "therefore , in order to preserve this symmetry , and in order to treat the non - local interactions in a consistent way , the next - to - leading terms have to be taken into account in the expansion of the fermion fields . to first order , among other contributions , three new spin - charge coupling terms appear in the hamiltonian .",
    "we find that the spin and charge velocities are changed by the term @xmath51 , and the symmetry - restoring non - local interaction terms are given by    [ eq : ham_nextorder ] h^(1)(x ) = & ( _ x _ s,+ ) ( _ x _ s,- ) ( 2_c ) + - & ( _ x _ c,+ ) ( _ x _ c,- ) ( 2_s ) + + & ( _ x _ c,+ ) ( _ x _ c,-)(_x _ s,+ ) ( _ x _ s,- ) .",
    "the first two terms correspond to backward and umklapp scattering , respectively , between electrons with opposite spins , and the third term describes backward - scattering processes between electrons with equal spins .",
    "initially , all these couplings are equal to @xmath49 , @xmath52 the su(2 ) symmetry of the spin sector assures @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55",

    "we note that the renormalization of the fermi velocities , which is a secondary effect , will not be taken into account in the following .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath60 can not be solved exactly . however , a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis permits the investigation of the relative importance of the various couplings . in the rg procedure , the couplings are considered to be a function of some scaling parameter @xmath61 , e.g. , the logarithm of the effective bandwidth .",
    "as the scaling parameter is taken to infinity , the flow of the couplings shows which of them are important and which can be ignored , depending on whether or not they tend to zero , to a finite value , or to infinity .",
    "for example , when all couplings but the forward scattering terms tend to zero , the hamiltonian  @xmath62 describes a luttinger liquid with freely propagating charge and spin degrees of freedom .    the one - loop rg equations for our five dimensionless running coupling constants @xmath63 read  @xcite    [ eq : rg_cs ]    = & 2 _",

    ", we note that we have started our analysis assuming that there is neither a charge gap nor a spin gap .",
    "this implies that a weak - coupling fixed point corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "equations   immediately imply that @xmath67 also , and that only @xmath68 remains undetermined .",
    "a linear stability analysis of the fixed - point line shows that it is stable against small perturbations @xmath49 and @xmath59 , that it is marginally stable against small perturbations @xmath58 and @xmath56 , and that its stability with respect to perturbations @xmath57 depends on the sign of the fixed - point value @xmath68 ( stable for @xmath69 , unstable for @xmath70 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the weak - coupling regime , it is convenient and sufficient to consider the rg equations without the spin - charge coupling terms , i.e. , we may consider the rg equations for @xmath71 .",

    ", a gap opens in the spin spectrum .",
    "if @xmath74 , this coupling is marginally irrelevant , i.e. , the spin mode remains soft . in the charge sector , @xmath75 initially , and this relation remains valid under the rg flow .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider eq .",

    "it is seen that for @xmath76 the charge mode becomes gapped because @xmath77 flows to infinity , otherwise the charge excitations remain gapless .",
