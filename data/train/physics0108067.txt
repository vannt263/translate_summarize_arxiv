    "it is known that many bubbles levitated in a liquid form a stable structure named `` bubble grapes '' when a weak standing sound wave is applied @xcite . in this stable structure , bubbles or clusters of them maintain a distance each other and tend not to collide , contrary to predictions given by the classical theory by bjerknes which allows either only attraction or repulsion .",
    "the distance between bubbles or clusters in the structure is comparable to their sizes .",
    "a similar phenomenon can be observed in a strong acoustic field @xcite in which bubbles form a complex filamentary structure varying slowly , whose scale is much smaller than the wavelength of the acoustic field .    in order to understand these phenomena",
    ", one should know thoroughly how the mutual interaction of the bubbles influences their acoustic properties . in ref .",
    "@xcite , zabolotskaya showed theoretically that the effective resonance frequencies of two interacting bubbles rise or fall as bubbles approach each other and that the variation in the resonance frequencies may sometimes causes the change of the sign of the secondary bjerknes force , which is an interaction force acting between pulsating bubbles , at a certain distance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , doinikov and zavtrak introduced a similar result by taking the multiple scattering of sound between two bubbles into account .",
    "they explain the origin of the change in the sign of the force as follows : when two bubbles oscillate in phase , their surfaces move against each other resulting in a stiffening of the bubbles .",
    "this may increase the effective resonance frequencies ( or eigenfrequencies ) of both bubbles and may sometimes cause the change in the sign of the force from attractive to repulsive .",

    "they determined that even when the distance between two bubbles is much larger than their equilibrium sizes the magnitude of the force becomes much larger than that predicted by a linear theory , and the sign of the force changes near the dynamical brake threshold or around the _ nonlinear _ resonance frequency . in ref .",
    "@xcite , doinikov showed that a neighboring bubble drastically varies the magnitude and sign of the primary bjerknes force , which an incident sound wave exerts on a bubble , in a strong acoustic field .    in this paper , following zabolotskaya s approach ,",

    "the model predicts only two eigenfrequencies when @xmath79 , as in zabolotskaya s model , and gives @xmath80 when @xmath81 and both bubbles make contact with each other , i.e. , @xmath82 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , zavtrak also discussed the eigenfrequency of the present case by means of a mathematical model in which multiple scattering between two bubbles is taken into account by the legendre polynomial expansion . in the case of @xmath82 ,",
    "zavtrak s model gives @xmath83 , which is in close agreement with the result obtained by kobelev and ostrovskii .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq24 ] ) gives @xmath84 which is lower by about 2 % than these values .",
    "this quantitative discrepancy is caused from the difference of functions for describing the scattered sound wave by a bubble .",
    "the amplitude of the scattered wave is assumed to be inversely proportional to @xmath66 in the model used here ( see eq .",

    "as discussed above , three eigenfrequencies changing with the distance between bubbles appear in each graph except for the case of @xmath81 where only one decreasing eigenfrequency appears .",
    "it should be noted that the larger bubble , whose partial resonance frequency is lower than that of the smaller bubble , has the highest eigenfrequency among those of a pair of bubbles .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the opinion represented in refs .",

    ", we can observe that , as the viscous effect grows strong , i.e. , the mean radii of the two bubbles become smaller , the subeigenfrequencies vanish gradually from the large - distance region ( and sometimes from the small - distance region ) and only the fundamental eigenfrequency remains . in the case of @xmath96 @xmath97 m , the subeigenfrequencies of a larger bubble disappear , and when the sizes of two bubbles are close each other the fundamental eigenfrequency and the higher one of subeigenfrequencies of a smaller bubble vanish in the small - distance region .",

    "this result means that in a high - viscosity case the effective resonance frequencies of both bubbles decrease monotonically as @xmath99 decreases .",
    "these results show that the influence of the mutual interaction on the eigenfrequencies depends on the viscosity of the surrounding material and is weakened as the viscous effect becomes stronger , i.e. , the threshold of the distance for the appearance of the subeigenfrequencies is shortened .    from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can expect that when @xmath100 @xmath97 m , @xmath101 @xmath97 m , and @xmath102 , for example , the signs of the primary bjerknes force acting on bubbles 1 and 2 change twice as the two bubbles approach each other since the curves shown in the figure for this case close with the line @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) at two points .",
