    "in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory there is a large class of two - dimensional models whose basic magnitudes can be computed exactly@xcite .",
    "the mathematics and physics of these integrable models are very rich , constituing areas of intensive investigation .",
    "there are in contrast very few integrable models in higher dimensions@xcite , where almost all the models which are interesting from a physical point of view are believed to be non integrable .",
    "these facts represent a major conceptual and technical gap between the 2d and the higher dimensional worlds , which would be desirable to fill in .",
    "the lack of exact techniques has always motivated the construction of approximative methods which very often give good quantitative and qualitative results .",
    "these methods can be roughly classified according to four main categories , namely : perturbative , variational , numerical and renormalization group , every one having advantages and limitations .",
    "the perturbative methods can be developed in a systematic way but are restricted to small values of the coupling constants .",
    "the variational ones give in general non perturbative results but rely on aprioristic or intuitive conjectures .",
    "the numerical approaches are in general unbiased but limited to small lattices . finally , the rg techniques when combined with one of the previous ones are very powerful for the study of critical phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the first two methods .",
    "our aim is to combine perturbative and variational techniques choosing the best of each and by passing some of their limitations .",
    "the problem we cope with is the construction of the ground state of a local lattice hamiltonian of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a coupling constant .",
    "our strategy is to use perturbation theory to set up a variational approach to the computation of the ground state wave function .",
    "the starting point is the choice of an exponential ansatz for the exact ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "the peculiarity of this ansatz is that , under certain assumptions about the ground state of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath3 , the whole hierarchy of perturbative equations can be solved systematically in terms of a collection of irreducible local operators @xmath9 , which are characterized by the order @xmath10 at which the operator @xmath11 first appears in perturbation theory .",
    "each operator @xmath11 comes in the ansatz multiplied by a weight @xmath12 higher powers .",
    "the data @xmath13 contain all the information required to built up the ground state . for small lattices it is easy to construct this set and therefore obtain the exact ground state , but for large lattices we have to resort to some kind of approximation .",
    "the natural thing to do is to truncate the ansatz considering only those operators @xmath11 with a level equal or less that a given number @xmath14 , which is the order in perturbation theory where one is working at .",
    "the problem is then to find the weights @xmath15 for @xmath16 . at this point",
    "one can follow two different paths : i ) use the truncated ansatz as a trial state in a standard variational fashion or ii ) take the truncated ansatz as the exact ground state of a hamiltonian which should be sufficiently close to the original one . in this paper",
    "we shall develop the approach i ) and leave the approach ii ) for another publication .",
    "we have so far outlined the main ideas and techniques which will be exemplified in the case of the ising model in a transverse magnetic field ( itf ) , but it should be clear from the exposition that they apply to more complicated models as for example the chiral potts model , the xxz- model , etc .    trial wave functions with an exponential or , more generally , product structure are known as jastrow wave functions and has been applied to a wide variety of problems in different areas as for example , liquid @xmath17he @xcite , nuclear matter @xcite , solid state physics @xcite and more recently in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite . in quantum mechanics",
    "a jastrow wave function is simply the exponential of the potential energy , @xmath18 and becomes exact for the simple harmonic oscillator . in a many body problem one replaces @xmath19 in the exponential by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some two body effective potential . in this paper",
    "we shall consider discrete versions of generalized jastrow states in contrast of the continuous versions described above . to our knowledge",
    "there is not in the literature a general and systematic study of this type of wave functions except for some interesting observations and discussions confined to particular models @xcite . among these observations",
    "is the fact that the norm of the jastrow wave functions coincides , in certain cases , with the partition function of an associated classical statistical mechanical model defined in the same dimension , with the variational parameter playing the role of inverse temperature . indeed , in the example of the itf we find that the norm of the exponential ansatz is given by the partition function of a classical ising model with couplings among the spins dictated by the familly of operators @xmath9 and as many coupling constants as weights @xmath22 . working with these generalized jastrow wave functions requires the knowledge of thermodynamic quantities such as internal energies , susceptibilities , etc .",
    "the calculation of these quantities is in general a difficult task and this imposes limitations to the variational approach i ) mentioned above .",
    "however in certain occasions the computation can be carried out exactly .",
    "this happens when the associated statistical system which underlies a particular ansatz is integrable .",
    "if the quantum hamiltonian is one dimensional then the statistical system is also one dimensional and the corresponding partition function can be easily computed .",
    "things are more interesting in two dimensions where , as we said in the introduction , most of the hamiltonians are not exactly solvable .",
    "the approximation method that we propose bring us to statistical systems in the same dimension , and therefore in two dimensions we may some times make contact with 2d integrable models .",
    "this opens the possibility of using the huge amount of information known in integrable 2d systems in the study of 2d quantum systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the p / v method . in section 3",
    "we apply the general ideas presented in section 2 to the ising model in a transverse magnetic field , making special emphasis in the 1d and 2d cases . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions and future prospects .",
    "all the technical details and computations are included in four appendices .",
    "let @xmath23 be a local lattice hamiltonian where @xmath3 is a hamiltonian whose ground state @xmath4 is non degenerate . we suppose that @xmath4 and its energy @xmath24 are known exactly .",
    "if @xmath8 is sufficiently small one can use standard perturbation theory to expand the ground state wave function @xmath25 and energy @xmath26 of @xmath23 as follows ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are subjected to satisfy a set of equations linking quantities of the same order @xcite . in order to write this set of equations",
    "we shall assume that @xmath25 can be reached from @xmath30 with the action of an operator of exponential type ,    @xmath31    the relation between the perturbative expansion ( [ 1 ] ) and the operators @xmath32 is given by a non - abelian version of the schur polynomials ,    @xmath33    if the operators @xmath32 commute among themselves then the above expressions coincide with the schur polynomials @xmath34 as functions of the variables @xmath32 .",
    "the equations satisfied by @xmath35 and @xmath36 translate now into a set of equations for @xmath32 and @xmath36 which we pass to derive .    introducing ( [ 3 ] ) into the eigenvalue equation ,    @xmath37    and multiplying on the left hand side by the inverse of the exponential one gets ,    @xmath38    to simplify ( [ 6 ] ) we use the identity @xcite ,    @xmath39    where    @xmath40 \\ ; , \\;\\ ;",

    "in particular the hermiticity properties of @xmath43 are not fixed a priori .",
    "there are two main choices that can be made in terms of hermitean or antihermitean operators .",
    "if @xmath43 is choosen to be antihermitean , then eq.([3 ] ) becomes a unitary transformation which preserves obviously the norm of the state , @xmath44 .",
    "moreover if that @xmath45 has an off diagonal form , then @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "when this happens it is customary to perform a unitary transformation ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is obliged to satisfy ,    @xmath49 + h_1 = 0 \\label{12}\\ ] ]    in order to cancel the terms proportial to @xmath8 in @xmath50 .",
    "this equation coincides with the first order equation in ( [ 10 ] ) but expressed in a matrix form , i.e. the dependence on the state @xmath30 has been dropped .",
    "finally the `` effective hamiltonian '' @xmath50 has the expansion ,    @xmath51 + o(\\l^3 ) \\label{13}\\ ] ]    these kind of unitary transformations are extensively used in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics@xcite , and have also been considered from a more mathematical point of view @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the study of those solutions to equations ( [ 10 ] ) which are hermitean .",
    "an immediate consequence of this choice is that the norm of the state @xmath25 is no longer the unity and in fact it will be an important quantity to compute ,    @xmath52    a peculiarity of equations ( [ 10 ] ) is that all the operators @xmath32 appear always involved in nested commutators .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath3 and @xmath45 are local operators defined on a lattice , i.e. operators involving a finite number of lattice variables located within a neighbourhood , whose size is independent of the size of the whole lattice .",
    "this kind of operators go , in the thermodynamic limit , to local operators in the continuum .",
    "we shall also assume that the number of degrees of freedom per site is finite .",
    "we want to investigate under which conditions the solution of the equations ( [ 10 ] ) can be given by a family of local operators .",
    "that this kind of solutions may exist is suggested by the property mentioned above about the nested structure of equations ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the commutator of local operators is again a local operator and therefore each equation ( [ 10 ] ) reduces to a sum of local operators acting on the unperturbed ground state .",
    "the other ingredient we shall require to achieve a local solution is an unperturbed ground state @xmath30 with an ordered structure , which can be ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , or of some more general type .",
    "this is sufficient to guarantee that the operators @xmath53 and @xmath32 should produce local disturbances acting on @xmath30 .",
    "there are many physical systems where these conditions are fullfilled .",
    "the reason for requiring an ordered ground state is that in this case equations ( [ 10 ] ) become a system of linear equations with a number of unknowns depending on the dimension of the lattice but not on its size .",
    "it will also depend on the order of perturbation theory and the number of lattice variables at each point .",
    "the aim of the above considerations is to make plausible the existence of solutions of the perturbative equations in terms of local operators @xmath32 , but of course it does not constitute a proof . later on",
    "we shall go through particular examples to show that this kind of solutions do indeed exist .",
    "in the case of the ising model , and we suspect it is a general feature , every operator @xmath32 is given by a sum of irreducible local operators which we denote by @xmath11 ,    @xmath54    where the coefficients @xmath55 are obtained by solving equations ( [ 10 ] ) . and where each operator @xmath11 is a product of pauli matrices located at different points of the lattice . the sum over @xmath56 in ( [ 15 ] ) is finite and contains in general operators that have already appeared in the solution of equations of lower order .",
    "it is convenient to define the level @xmath10 of @xmath11 as the order in perturbation theory at which this operator appears for the first time in the solution of equations ( [ 10 ] ) ,    @xmath57    introducing ( [ 15 ] ) into ( [ 3 ] ) and interchanging the order of the sums @xmath58 , we rewrite the exponential ansatz as follows ,    @xmath59    where @xmath15 is the `` weight '' of @xmath11 in the ground state ,    @xmath60",
    "the factor @xmath61 in eq.([17 ] ) has been introduced for later convenience .",
    "definition ( [ 18 ] ) implies that @xmath15 has a taylor expansion starting at @xmath62 , and containing non vanishing terms of higher powers whenever @xmath11 appears in the solution of eqs.([10 ] ) .",
    "the knowledge of a single function @xmath15 will in general require solving the entire hierarchy ( [ 10])!. at this stage one may wonder whether there are other alternatives to compute the functions @xmath22 rather than solving the whole hierarchy ( [ 10 ] ) . to handle this problem",
    "it is illustrative to compare equations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "they both give two different perturbative approximations to the ground state . while ( [ 3 ] ) is an expansion in the coupling constant @xmath8 , eq.([17 ] ) is a kind of cluster expansion . in a sense",
    "they are conjugated perturbative expansions . exploiting this analogy",
    "we shall propose an alternative way for computing @xmath15 .",
    "in standard perturbation theory one truncates the state excluding corrections beyond a given power @xmath63 .",
    "the analog of this for ( [ 17 ] ) will be to truncate the sum over @xmath56 to contain only those operators @xmath11 with a level @xmath10 less or equal than a given order @xmath14 ,    @xmath64    in eq.([19 ] ) we leave open the possibility that the weights @xmath65 depend on the order of the approximation @xmath14 .",
    "the problem now is how to determine @xmath65 . in this paper",
    "we shall use a variational method which consist in taking ( [ 19 ] ) as a trial wave function for the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath65 are of course the variational parameters .",
    "minimization of the energy of this state will give the weights @xmath65 as functions of @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that this minimization procedure should agree with the result obtained in perturbation theory to the same degree of accuracy , i.e.    @xmath67    on the other hand , it is well known that if one takes the perturbative solution to an order @xmath14 as a trial wave function then the variational energy agrees with the perturbative expansion to order @xmath68 @xcite ,    @xmath69    this fact already illustrates at the perturbative level the usefulness of combining both perturbative and variational techniques order correction of the wave function allows the computation of the energy to order @xmath70 according to the formula @xmath71 . ] .",
    "next we consider the non - perturbative aspects of ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "the question is whether this ansatz can be extended to large values of @xmath8 remaining close to the exact ground state .",
    "in particular in the limit @xmath72 we wish the state @xmath73 to flow to the ground state manifold of the hamiltonian @xmath45 , i.e.    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the ground state energy of @xmath45 .",
    "if this equation holds then @xmath76 will interpolate in a continuous way the ground state of @xmath3 and those of @xmath45 , giving certain validity to the results obtained for the intermediate values of the coupling constant @xmath8 , where a weak or a strong coupling expansion are dubious .",
    "a sufficient set of conditions for eq.([22 ] ) to hold is the existence , within the family of operators expanded by @xmath77 , of an hermitean operator @xmath78 having a common eigenvector , say @xmath79 , with the hamiltonian @xmath45 , and such that @xmath79 and @xmath4 have non - vanishing overlap ,    @xmath80    under these conditions it is easy to see that the ansatz @xmath76 for @xmath81 flows to @xmath79 in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "the interest of conditions ( [ 23 ] ) is that they strongly restrict the possible solutions of the perturbative equations ( [ 10 ] ) ( see appendix c for concrete examples ) .",
    "in this section we shall study in detail the ising model in a transverse field .",
    "let us introduce our notations and some generalities valid in any dimension .",
    "the model is defined in a hypercubic lattice in d dimensions and @xmath82 sites with a hamiltonian given by @xcite ,    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are pauli matrices acting at the site @xmath86 , with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 is any of the lattice vectors @xmath90 . the cases @xmath91 and @xmath92 correspond to a linear chain and a rectangular planar lattice respectively .",
    "we shall suppose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the phase diagram of this hamiltonian as a function of @xmath8 and the temperature is well known @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to zero temperature , whose analysis is interesting because it shows a simple but non trivial example of quantum critical phenomena @xcite . in this case",
    "there is a critical transverse field @xmath93 below which there are two ferromagnetic ground states characterized by the non vanishing of @xmath94 . for @xmath95",
    "the ground state is disordered and @xmath96 but @xmath97 .",
    "near @xmath93 the critical behaviour of the @xmath98 ising model with transverse field as a function of @xmath8 at @xmath99 is the same as the critical behaviour of the classical ising model in two dimensions as a function of @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the ising model hamiltonian in 1d is related to the transfer matrix of the 2d statistical ising model .",
    "the analogy between the quantum critical behaviour of the d - dimensional itf and the statistical critical behaviour of the ising model in d+1 dimensions for d=1 is believed to hold for @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "this fact is not peculiarity of the itf but a property which holds more generally @xcite .    in @xmath98",

    "the density energy at the critical field is ,    @xmath106    for dimensions higher than one the exact solution is not known and only approximations are available @xcite . in the next subsections we shall obtain variational upper bounds for the exact energy .",
    "it is also possible to obtain a lower bound for the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( [ 24 ] ) ,    @xmath107    there are two extreme cases where one can find the exact ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ 24 ] ) . at @xmath108",
    "there are two ferromagnetic ground states corresponding to @xmath109 given by ,    @xmath110    where @xmath111 denote the eigenstates of @xmath85 with eigenvalues @xmath112 respectively .",
    "the density energy of these states is ,    @xmath113    at @xmath114 the ground state is the non degenerate disordered state ( @xmath115 ) ,    @xmath116    whose energy is given in the limit @xmath117 by ,    @xmath118    the hamiltonian ( [ 24 ] ) commutes with the spin rotation operator ,    @xmath119    and therefore its spectrum can be split into an even @xmath120 and odd @xmath121 sectors .",
    "the ground state ( [ 31 ] ) of the disorder phase belongs to the even sector whereas in the ordered phase there is a ground state belonging to each of the two sectors .",
    "we shall study the ordered and disordered phases independently . in the next two subsections we present the results of the computation of the energy and the variational parameters using the variational method .",
    "the details of their derivation will be presented in the appendices .",

    "the ground state is degenerate and therefore we could not in principle apply the techniques of section 2 .",
