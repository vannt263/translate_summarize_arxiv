    "the brightness of the nova increased very slowly .",
    "the maximum brightness was attained on july 10.0 ut at @xmath19 = 6.53 ( munari et al . , 2007b ) which was followed by a flattening of the light curve and then a slow decline during which the nova underwent four more re - brightenings ( tanaka et al .",

    "2007a ; poggiani 2008 ) .",
    "the spectra recorded during the pre - maxima phase were dominated by the strong balmer and he i lines along with weak features of emission lines of fe ii multiplets , mg ii , n ii ,",
    "si ii , ca i and [ o i ] .",
    "all of these emission lines exhibited narrow and sharp profiles with typical full widths at half maxima ( fwhm ) of about 480 - 540 km s@xmath6 , as measured from balmer lines , which is a value range generally associated with fe ii type novae .",
    "most of the strong emission lines were accompanied by absorption components of p - cygni profiles , blueshifted by 400 - 500 km s@xmath6 .",
    "munari et al . (",
    "2007b ) estimated a reddening of @xmath20 = 0.36 from the na i d1 and d2 lines .",
    "no significant change in the spectra was noticed during the pre - maximum evolution except the disappearance of he i lines and the emergence of fe ii multiplets in emission on 2007 may 11 ( munari et al .",
    "+ significant changes in the spectra were noticed during and after the initial maximum .",
    "the spectra , observed during and a short time after the initial maxima on 2007 july 10 , were characterized by a smooth underlying continuum with numerous weak absorptions along with strong emission lines of balmer series and feii multiplets ( iijima 2007b , munari et al .",
    "also , the he i lines which had disappeared on 2007 may 11 , reappeared on 2007 july 12 .",
    "also a remarkable change was noticed in the line profile widths .",
    "the emission lines which were narrow in the pre - maxima stage , become strong and broad ( fwhm @xmath5 1150 km s@xmath6 , munari 2007b ) which indicated the presence of fast hot winds .",
    "the nature of the spectra did not change much during the remaining part of the evolution till 2007 nov 2 ( tanaka et al . 2011 ) ; the spectra were dominated by strong emission features of h , fe ii and he i lines along with weak emission features of oi , nii , cii .",
    "many of these emission features were accompanied by sharp p - cygni profile which disappeared gradually with time .",
    "further spectroscopic follow up during the declining phase by poggiani ( 2010 ) reported the appearance of forbidden lines , e.g. , [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007 , and [ fe vi ] , [ fe vii ] , [ ca v ] which suggests that v5558 sgr had entered the nebular phase .",
    "overall , the spectral behavior of v5558 sgr before and after the maximum , is very similar to that of v723 cas ( iijima 2007b ; poggiani , 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "poggiani ( 2010 ) estimated the characteristic time t@xmath21 ( time taken to decline by 3 magnitudes from visual maximum ) = 170 @xmath4 2 days making the nova a slow one according to the definition of speed class ( payne - gaposchin 1957 ) . using the value of t@xmath21 poggiani ( 2010 ) revised the estimated value of the distance to be 1.3 - 1.6 kpc and absolute magnitude ( m@xmath22 ) at maximum in the range of 6.3 - 5.9 in agreement with the value of 6 @xmath4 1 observed in case of slow novae v723 cas and hr del . using these values poggiani ( 2010 )",

    "we have certain reservations on poggiani s ( 2010 ) method of deriving the distance which is discussed in section 3.2 + the first infrared observations of v5558 sgr were formally reported by lynch et al .",
    "the infrared spectrum ( 0.8 - 2.5 @xmath0 m ) observed on 2007 september 12 , showed strong and narrow ( fwhm @xmath5 620 km s@xmath6 ) emission lines of h i , he i , oi , ca ii , fe ii , and [ n i ] .",

    "the observations are is described in section 2 and the results in section 3 .",
    "v5558 sgr was observed in the near - infrared @xmath1 ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath0 m ) region using the 1.2 m telescope at mount abu infrared observatory operated by physical research laboratory , india .",
    "observations were taken on 7 epochs in the pre - maxima rising phase and on 1 epoch in the post - maxima phase .",
    "the nova could not be followed in the months of mid - june to mid - october due to monsoon season .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath1 spectra presented in this paper were obtained in each of @xmath23 bands at similar dispersions of @xmath5 9.75  / pixel using the near infrared imager / spectrometer with a 256@xmath7256 hgcdte nicmos3 array .",
    "each time a set of at least two spectra of the object at two dithered position along the slit were taken . in the same manner , a set of two spectra of a nearby comparison star ( sao 161564 , spectral type b9.2/a0v , @xmath19 = 5.126 ) at similar airmass as the object were taken at the same grating position in order to remove the atmospheric absorption effects from the nova spectra .",
    "each set of two images were subtracted from each other to eliminate the background counts which comprises of emission from sky and dark counts from the detector . from these subtracted images spectra",
    "were extracted using iraf tasks . the spectra were wavelength calibrated using a combination of oh sky lines and telluric lines that register with the stellar spectra . following the standard procedure ,",
    "hydrogen paschen and brackett absorption lines were removed from the spectra of the comparison star and the nova spectra were then divided by the spectra of the comparison star .",
    "the ratioed spectra were multiplied by a blackbody curve generated at the effective temperature of the comparison star to get the final spectra .",
    "however , caution should be taken while considering any spectral feature around 1.12 @xmath0 m in the @xmath24 band and between 2 to 2.05 @xmath0 m in the k band , especially , in the early phase spectra when the emission lines are not so strong .",
    "this is because some differences in airmass between the nova and comparison star remained .",
    "hence , the ratioing process , while removing telluric features , leaves some residuals in these wavelength regions where telluric absorption due to atmospheric oxygen and carbon - dioxide respectively are strong .",
    "the log of spectroscopic observations are provided in table 1 .",
    "+ near - infrared photometric observations of the nova in the @xmath1 bands were done in photometric sky conditions using the imaging mode of the nicmos3 array .",
    "several frames , both of the nova and a selected standard star ( sao 186544 , spectral type b0.5ib / iic , @xmath19 = 6.02 ) in each of the @xmath25 filters , were recorded in 5 dithered positions offset typically by 20 arcsec .",
    "near - infrared @xmath1 magnitudes were then extracted using apphot package in iraf following the regular procedure for photometric reduction ( e.g. banerjee @xmath10 ashok , 2002 ) followed by us .",

    "the partial @xmath19 band light curve for the first 250 days , to specially highlight the secondary maxima , is shown in figure 1 while the entire lightcurve over an extended period of 6.25 years from @xmath26 is shown in figure 2 . in figure 1",
    "we also show the near - infrared @xmath1 light curves .",

    "abu observations ( see table 2 ) and smarts / ctio 1.5 m telescope facility ( walter et al . , 2012 ) . the epochs of mount abu infrared observations are marked by vertical dashes on the light curve .",
    "after the outburst the light curve rises very slowly .",
    "we find from aavso data that the nova took about sixty days to reach @xmath19 = 8.5 from the discovery magnitude 10.3 . after staying at @xmath19 = 8.5 , for a few days ,",
    "the nova underwent its first episode of rebrightening to reach m@xmath27 = 6.48 on 2007 july 10.56 ( jd = 2454292.06 ) which is in line with the findings of munari et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "following this , the brightness of v5558 sgr started to decrease . during the declining phase , v5558 sgr showed at least four more secondary outbursts occurring on july 25 ( @xmath19 = 7.7 , t = 101.6 days ) , august 12 ( @xmath19 = 7.0 , t = 119 days ) , september 25 ( @xmath19 = 7.1 , t = 163 days ) and october 31 ( @xmath19 = 7.4 , t = 199.6 days ) respectively , where t = days after commencement of the eruption . after the fifth maxima v5558 sgr declined slowly ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the near - infrared light curves are seen to mimic the behavior of the optical lightcurve and do not warrant any special comments . during the pre - maximum stage",
    "a gradual rising is seen in all the three near - infrared @xmath1 bands similar to optical light curve , the j - h and h - k values were about 0.2 and 0.3 respectively .",
    "we do not have any near - infrared observation during the first maximum .",
    "however , the smart / ctio observations during the other secondary maxima show that the j - h and h - k have been about 1.1 and in the range of 0.6 - 1.0 , respectively . from near - infrared observations we do not notice any excess in any of the near - infrared @xmath1 light curves which indicates that no dust has been formed in the nova ejecta",
    ". + the light curve shows all the characteristics of the j class of novae based on the classification system of strope et al .",
    "j class of nova show jittering or flare - ups of substantial amplitude which could be thought of as outbursts above a smoothed light curve that follows the universal decline law predicted by hachisu @xmath10 kato ( 2006 ) .",
    "strope et al . (",
    "2010 ) listed 14 novae that belong to j type .",
    "while we compare the light curve of v5558 sgr with these novae , we find close similarities with v723 cas and hr del out of these 14 novae . both of v723 cas and hr del showed a prolonged pre - maximum halts , v723 cas took 100 days and hr del took 180 days respectively to reach the maximum .",
    "both of these novae showed multiple outbursts , v723 cas showed 6 outbursts in between 100 and 425 days and hr del showed 5 outbursts in between 180 and 380 days .",
    "+    the cause behind the occurrence of multi - outbursts , as observed in this nova , is not well understood .",
    "previous studies of slow novae have shown that multi - outbursts might take place on white dwarfs of mass @xmath5 0.6 m@xmath9 which is close to the critical value required beginning of the thermonuclear runaway event ( for example , friedjung et al .",
    "1992 ; kato et al .",
    "however , recent calculations with opal opacities , show that thermonuclear runaway may occur even in much less massive white dwarfs ( wds ) , e.g. , 0.2 - 0.5 m@xmath28 wds ( shen et al . 2009 ) . in a recent study ,",
    "kato @xmath10 hachisu ( 2009 , 2011 ) pointed out that two different types of evolution of slow novae of a certain range of wd masses , @xmath5 0.5 - 0.7 m@xmath28 may take place .",
    "one is the evolution with optically thick winds and the other is without optically thick winds .",
    "the wind - type novae show a sharp peak in the optical light curve and the light curve decays quickly . on the other hand novae without an optically thick wind evolve very slowly and stay at an extended low - temperature stage for a long time , which makes a long - lasting flat optical peak .",
    "they suggested that transition from the state of non - optically thick winds to a state of optically thick winds may take place .",
    "such a transition may be accompanied by violent activities like oscillatory behaviors in the light curves of few slow novae which are considered as some relaxation processes associated with the transition .",
    "this kind of transition in low - mass wds ( @xmath29 0.6 m@xmath28 ) in close binary system , may be triggered by the companion star through the effects of ( 1 ) spin - up by the companion motion , ( 2 ) gravity of the companion star , and ( 3 ) drag luminosity due to frictional energy deposition . incorporating these effects",
    ", the authors @xmath30 generated two trial models adopting a parameter set of the mass of white dwarf and companion , chemical composition of the envelope and the orbit .",
    "the trial light curves successfully reproduced the flat phase of static evolution followed by a smooth decline due to wind mass loss . from this",
    "study the wd mass was estimated to be about 0.6 m@xmath28 for all three novae , v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr .",
    "if the data points of the 5 major rebrightenings or secondary maxima are excluded , then it is found that the entire light curve can be fit by one uniform curve that initially rises and then declines .",
    "this uniform curve , on which the secondary maxima sit , is shown by the gray line which is obtained by a least - squares minimized polynomial fit .",
    "from this smooth curve , we estimate that maximum to be reached on 5 july 2007 at v = 8.3 ; t@xmath31 and t@xmath21 , the times to decline by 2 and 3 magnitudes from visual maximum , to be 281 @xmath4 3 and 473 @xmath4 3 days respectively .",
    "v5558 is therefore an unusually slow nova ; possibly one of the slowest ever known ( from the selection of well - observed novae by warner(1995 ) , only do aql has larger t@xmath31 and t@xmath21 values of 430 and 900d respectively ) .",
    "the validity of using maximum magnitude - rate of decline ( mmrd ) relations for such extremely slow novae is debatable because most mmrd relations are obtained as outcomes of fits of m@xmath27 to t@xmath31 or t@xmath21 values in which the latter have much smaller values .",
    "for example , considering two well known relations , in the sample used by della valle @xmath10 livio ( 1995 ) the largest value of t@xmath31 is 117d and in the downes and duerbeck ( 2000 ) mmrd sample there is only one nova with t@xmath31 greater than 100 days ( viz .",
    "hr del with t@xmath31 = 172d ) . in general",
    "not many very slow novae are known ; capaccioli et al .",
    "( 1990 ) cite the case of one nova in the lmc with t@xmath31 = 117d while darnley et al ( 2006 ) give instances of four novae with t@xmath31 exceeding 100d viz .",
    "817.2 , 198 , 100.3 and 331d respectively .",
    "we thus estimate m@xmath27 and the distance to the nova using a different approach .",
    "the variation of the extinction with distance towards the nova is shown , for a ten arc minute field around the object , in the bottom panel of figure 2 based on modeling of the galactic extinction by marshall et al .",
    "two values of the excess @xmath32 have been estimated for v5558 sgr using independent approaches . from the interstellar nai d1 and d2 lines ,",
    "munari et al ( 2007a ) obtain @xmath32 = 0.36 while rudy et al ( 2007 ) obtain @xmath32 @xmath5 0.8 based on the relative strengths of the o i 8446 and 12187   lines .",
    "both methods are known to yield reliable estimates of the reddening . using both these values of @xmath32 , and the relations a@xmath27",
    "= 3.1@xmath32 and a@xmath27 = 11a@xmath33 , the distance to the nova from figure 2 ( bottom panel ) is then constrained to lie in the range 1.3 and 1.8 kpc ( i.e @xmath34 = 1.55 @xmath4 0.25 kpc ) .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath1 spectra of v5558 sgr are presented in figures 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the lines are marked on the figures and a list of the identified lines are given in table 3 .",
    "the epochs of our observations are indicated by bars on the abscissa on top in figure 1 .",
    "the presented near - infrared data covers the premaxima evolution till jun 10 , our last data is on oct 20 , 11 days before the fifth maximum which was reached on 31 october .",
    "none of our spectra unfortunately coincide with the rebrightenings to monitor spectral changes that took place at these secondary maxima .",
    "+ in the initial stage , during 2007 april 26 - june 10 , the @xmath1 spectra show strong emission lines of hi ; these include pa@xmath35 and pa@xmath36 in the j band , br10 to 19 in the h band and br@xmath35 in k band . except the paschen and brackett series lines ,",

    "our @xmath24 band has poorer resolution than the @xmath37 , gives values of @xmath5 240 - 260 km s@xmath6 for both lines indicating a very slow velocity for the ejecta . during the pre - maxima phase",

    "in addition , a small fraction of novae display characteristics of both classes and these are referred to as `` hybrid '' or `` fe iib '' novae .",
    "these novae have strong fe ii lines soon after the outburst which are broader than those seen in typical `` fe ii '' novae and subsequently display `` he / n '' spectrum .",
    "an example of `` hybrid '' nova is v574 pup ( naik et al . 2010 ;",
    "also see williams 1992 ) .",

    ", the principal differentiating feature between the two classes is the strong presence of carbon lines in `` fe ii '' novae and their absence in he / n novae .",
    "the strongest of these c lines appear in the j band at 1.166 and 1.175 @xmath0 m and in the h band at 1.6890 @xmath0 m and several lines between 1.72 to 1.79 @xmath0 m . on the other hand , he / n novae",

    "few near - infrared lines of nitrogen are detected in both fe ii or he / n spectra ( for e.g the 1.2461 , 1.2469 @xmath0 m lines ) but they are invariably stronger in he / n novae as observed in optical spectra also ( williams 1992 ) .",
    "+ v5558 sgr comes closest to being classified as a hybrid nova but with an anomalous component .",
    "the hybrid tag is justified because it showed a transition from one class to another but the anomaly arises because the transition was in the reverse direction viz from he / n to feii instead of the other way around .",
    "only one other hybrid nova t pyx has shown such a similar reverse transition , both in the optical and near - infrared ( see joshi et al .",
    "2014 for the near - infrared behavior and references therein for the optical results ) .",
    "let us review the optical and near - infrared behavior of v5558 sgr and compare them using the present results and those from tanaka et al ( 2011 ) because they share common dates ( or very nearby ) of observation between the two .    in the optical , on april 16 it appeared as a he / n type nova but by 2007 april 25 fe ii lines and a fe ii class spectrum appeared showing that it had evolved from the he / n type to the fe ii type .",
    "t pyx made a similar transition within a week or less ( joshi et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the near - infrared , there is no spectrum on 16 april to compare with the optical .",
    "but for the tanaka et al ( 2011 ) spectrum of 25 april in the optical , the near - infrared spectra of 26 april is available and this is certainly not of the fe ii type .",
    "no prominent ci lines are present as was clearly seen in t pyx .",
    "the near - infrared spectra at this stage more closely resemble the he / n class ( there is a caveat attached to this sentence which we qualify later ) .",
    "all subsequent optical spectra between 25 april to 10 june are of typical of the fe ii class but surprisingly all the near - infrared spectra during this same time are more close to the he / n type .",
    "this is a major difference in the optical and @xmath47 behavior and a significant finding from this work .",
    "this adds complexity to any unification scheme ( williams 2012 ; shore 2013 ) that tries to explain fe ii , he / n and hybrid novae simultaneously .    in the paradigm proposed by williams ( 2012 ) , the the he / n spectra have their origin in the material lost from the white dwarf surface during the thermonuclear runaway .",
    "that is why the he lines , responsible jointly with n lines for the creation of the he / n tag , are only seen immediately after the outburst before the he - rich nova ejecta material intermingles with a large circumbinary envelope of gas whose origin is the secondary star . the dominance of the he lines is thus decreased .",
    "the fe ii spectra point to their formation in this large circumbinary envelope of gas which is proposed to be created by the impact of the nova ejecta with the secondary star . depending on the proximity of the secondary star , the wd ejecta mass , and the radiation field impinging on the secondary star",
    ", the secondary star could be stimulated to eject mass .",
    "hybrid objects are explained by changing parameters in the two emitting regions ( one comprising of the wd ejecta material and the other of the circumbinary envelope ) during the post outburst decline . how the contrasting ir behavior ( vis - a - vis the optical behavior ) in v5558 sgr could be reconciled within this scheme will be interesting to see .",
    "we do not have a easy or straightforward answer to explain the observed behavior but are working on a general model that tries to reproduce both the fe ii and he / n type spectra .",
    "in such a model , we feel there is a need for including an additional parameter which considers the changing excitation and ionization conditions in the ejecta resulting from changes in the central wd s temperature .",
    "if we do not take help of the optical spectra and base a classification solely on just the near - infrared spectra during and around maximum ( i.e. spectra between april to june ) , the caveats associated with a he / n classification throughout this period are as follows .",
    "first the he lines , the important ones being expected at 1.0830 , 1.7002 and 2.0581 , are very weak or missing .",
    "however ni is present in the form of ni 1.2461 , 1.2469 @xmath0 m right from the earliest stage at a strength roughly consistent with that expected in the he / n class .",
    "but there is another troubling anomaly .",
    "the observed width of the lines are very narrow whereas he / n novae invariably have line widths of several thousands of km / s .",
    "thus , on the whole , the spectra of v5558 sgr emphasizes both the complexity and the diversity of novae spectra .",

    "representative results for four days viz .",
    "2007 april 29 , may 05 , jun 10 and oct 20 are presented in figure 7 which represents the observed strength of the brackett lines with respect to br14 normalized to unity .",
    "debelending of the h lines with contaminating lines ( for e.g. br 10 and br 11 with feii lines ) was done either manually ( see figure 8 as an example ) or using iraf tasks .",
    "the observed h line strengths , presented in table 3 , were then compared with that expected by using case b emissivities from storey @xmath10 hummer ( 1995 ) . from recombination theory it is qualitatively expected , under optically thin conditions , that when strengths of lines of the same series are compared , a lower line of the series should be stronger than a higher line . for example , it is expected that br@xmath35 ( corresponding to a transition between levels 74 ) is expected to be significantly stronger than any higher line of the series like br10 or br11 ( transitions between 10  4 and 11  4 respectively ) . but the reverse is actually being observed here on all epochs except for 2007 20 october .",
    "this clearly indicates that at these epochs the br @xmath35 line is optically thick and possibly so are the other br lines also .",
    "the comparison has been made here with a representative case b model at t = 10000k and density = 10@xmath39 @xmath41 but our conclusions will remain equally valid for case b values over an extended parameter space of electron density n@xmath48 varying between 10@xmath49 and 10@xmath50 @xmath41 and temperature varying between 5000 and 20000 k. this may be seen for e.g. in a similar detailed graphical illustration done for the novae rs oph @xmath51 and t pyx @xmath52 .    because the br lines appear optically thick , their actual strengths are unknown and hence it is not possible to estimate the mass of the nova by comparing observed and predicted case b line luminosities .",
    "however , the emission measure @xmath53 can be constrained where @xmath54 is the linear size of the emitting region .",
    "the values of the opacity @xmath55 for different hi lines for transitions between levels @xmath56 at different temperatures and densities are known ( tabulated in hummer @xmath10 storey 1987 ; storey @xmath10 hummer 1995 ) .",
    "the optical depth at line - center @xmath57 can be calculated using @xmath58 = @xmath59 , where @xmath54 is the path length in cm . from figure 8 , among the brackett lines , it can be clearly seen the br @xmath35 line is definitely optically thick .",
    "thus we use the br@xmath35 line and assume with considerable certainty that its optical depth is greater than unity i.e. @xmath58(br@xmath35)@xmath60 1 .    from storey @xmath10 hummer ( 1995 )",
    "we note that the value of the opacity factor @xmath55 does not vary too much with density or temperature for the near - infared hi lines including br@xmath35 ( the quantitative change is mentioned a sentence later ) .",
    "since in the early outburst stages , the electron density in the nova ejecta is expected to be high ( values as high as @xmath61 = 10@xmath62 @xmath41 are even invoked ) we make a conservative estimate that @xmath61 is in the range 10@xmath63 to 10@xmath50 @xmath41 . using the range of values of @xmath55 between 1.3 @xmath7 10@xmath64 to 7.46 @xmath7 10@xmath64 corresponding to @xmath61 values varying between 10@xmath63 to 10@xmath50 @xmath41 for a representative temperature @xmath65 = 10@xmath66 k , we get the emission measure @xmath67 to be in the range 1.3 @xmath7 10@xmath68 to 7.7 @xmath7 10@xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "approximate constraints on the electron density can be obtained if we can take @xmath54 to be the kinematic distance @xmath70 traveled by the ejecta where @xmath71 is the velocity of ejecta and @xmath72 is time after outburst . using a representative value of @xmath71 = 250 kms@xmath6 as discussed earlier and @xmath72 ranging from 12 to 188 days , and applying the constraint that @xmath58(br@xmath35)= @xmath59 @xmath60 1 ; we obtain lower limits for @xmath61 in the range 1.7 @xmath7 10@xmath63 @xmath41 to 1.6 @xmath7 10@xmath39 @xmath41 ( assuming @xmath61 = @xmath73 ) .",
    "these lower limits are likely to be smaller than the actual @xmath61 values because @xmath58(br@xmath35 ) can be considerably @xmath60 1 that has been used above . the density in the ejecta is seen to be fairly high over the duration of our observations .",
    "it is worth noting lynch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that high densities of 10@xmath39 @xmath41 or more tend to thermalize the level populations through collisions and thereby bring about deviations from case b predictions as is observed here .    by 20 october , the ejecta appears to have diluted sufficiently to be optically thin and the line strengths follow a caseb distribution well .",
    "we estimate of the mass of the emitting gas at this epoch using the same approach as in some earlier novae by using the following relation ( banerjee et al .",
    "2010 , raj et al .",
    "2013 ) :    @xmath74    where @xmath34 is the distance , @xmath75 the proton mass , @xmath76 the observed flux in a particular line , @xmath77 the corresponding case b emissivity ; @xmath19 is the volume of the emitting gas which equals @xmath78 $ ] , where @xmath79 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the filling factor , velocity and time after outburst , respectively . we assume t = 10000k and n@xmath48 to be @xmath5 10@xmath39 @xmath41 prompted both by the goodness of the fit in the bottom panel of figure 7 and for the following additional reason .",
    "as discussed above , n@xmath48 was close to @xmath5 10@xmath39 @xmath41 during our june observation ( 57d after outburst ) but most likely had an even higher value .",
    "if the ejecta subsequently diluted geometrically ( n@xmath48 @xmath80 r@xmath81 ) thereafter upto 20 october ( 188d after outburst ) , the density would drop by a factor of 10 ( i.e. square of 57/188 ) . based on this choice of n@xmath48 , we estimate the mass of the gas in the ejecta in the range ( 6.0 @xmath4 1.5 ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 .",
