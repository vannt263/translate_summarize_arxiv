    "quantum key distribution ( qkd)@xcite is one of the most realistic applications in quantum information",
    ". it aims at extending a secret key between two distant parties , commonly noted as alice and bob .",
    "the unconditional security has been proven even when an eavesdropper , eve , has unlimited computation power permitted by quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "the best known protocol of qkd is the bb84 protocol@xcite presented by bennett and brassard in 1984 . in bb84 , alice encodes the key information randomly into the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bases and sends quantum pulses to bob .",
    "bob measures the received pulses in two bases randomly .",
    "after that , they compare the basis through an authenticated classical channel . the key can only be extracted from the pulses where they use the same basis and this results in that on average half of the raw data is discarded .",
    "that is , the basis - sift factor is @xmath4 in the original bb84 protocol .",
    "this factor can be improved by the efficient bb84 scheme proposed by lo et al .",
    "@xcite . in the efficient scheme ,",
    "alice and bob put a bias in the probabilities of choosing the @xmath0 basis and @xmath1 basis , which can make the basis sift - factor close to @xmath5 in the infinitely long key limit .",
    "the efficient bb84 scheme is experimentally demonstrated in 2009@xcite .    in practical qkd systems , a highly attenuated laser or a weak coherent state source",
    "is widely used to substitute for a perfect single - photon source which is beyond state - of - the - art technology .",
    "a weak coherent state source contains multi - photon components ( details shown in methods ) .",
    "when multi - photon states are used for qkd , eve can launch attacks , like the photon - number - splitting ( pns ) attack@xcite , to break the security . since eve could have a full control of the quantum channel",
    ", she can make the transmittance of multi - photon states to be @xmath5 in the pns attack . in a conventional security analysis@xcite ,",
    "alice and bob have to assume all the losses and errors come from the single - photon components in the worst scenario case . as a result",
    ", the performance of qkd is very poor . to improve the performance of the weak coherent state qkd , hwang proposed the decoy - state method@xcite . instead of sending one coherent state , alice sends pulses with different intensities , so that she can obtain more information to monitor the quantum channel . to maintain the detection statistics of coherent states with different intensities , eve is not able to change the transmittances of single - photon and multi - photon state freely without being noticed by alice and bob .",
    "the security of the decoy - state method is proven@xcite , along with various practical schemes@xcite .",
    "follow - up experimental demonstrations show that the decoy - state method is a very effective way to improve qkd performance@xcite .",
    "naturally , we can improve the decoy - state method by applying the biased - basis idea of the efficient bb84 protocol .",
    "there are a few observations .",
    "first , alice does not need to choose basis when she chooses the vacuum decoy state .",
    "second , if alice and bob mainly choose one basis , say @xmath0 basis , for key generation , they effectively treat @xmath1 basis as for quantum channel testing . in this sense ,",
    "the functionality of @xmath1 basis is similar to the decoy states .",
    "intuitively , one may expect to combine decoy states and @xmath1 basis together .    here",
    ", we propose a new decoy - state method with biased basis choice , following the widely used decoy - state scheme , vacuum+weak decoy - state method@xcite ( a quick review is shown in methods ) , where alice sends out pulses with three different intensities , vacuum ( with an intensity of 0 ) , weak decoy ( with an intensity of @xmath6 ) and signal ( with an intensity of @xmath7 ) states .    1",
    ".   alice prepares _ all _ the signal pulses ( @xmath7 ) in the @xmath0 basis , where the final secure key is extracted from . 2 .",
    "she prepares weak decoy pulses ( @xmath6 ) in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 with certain probabilities .",
    "if she chooses the vacuum decoy state , she does not need to set any basis .",
    "4 .   bob measures the received pulses in the @xmath1 basis and @xmath0 basis with probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the scheme is summarized in table [ tab : biased : scheme ] . in the new scheme ,",
    "only 4 sets of preparations are used by alice .",
    "compared to the original vacuum+weak decoy - state method , where 6 sets are used , the proposed scheme can simplify the system and reduce the cost of random numbers . later in the simulation , we will show that this scheme can also improve the qkd performance .    following the gllp security analysis@xcite , the key generation rate@xcite",
    "is given by @xmath10+q_0\\ } , \\\\",
    "i_{ec } & = fq_{\\mu}h(e_{\\mu } ) , \\\\ q & = \\frac{n_\\mu p_{z}}{n_{total } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the raw data sift factor , including basis - sift factor and signal - state ratio ; @xmath12 is the cost of error correction and the rest terms in the bracket is the rate of privacy amplification ; @xmath13 is the error correction inefficiency ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the overall gain and quantum bit error rate ( qber ) ; @xmath16 is the gain of the single - photon components and @xmath17 is its corresponding phase error rate ; @xmath18 is the background gain ; @xmath19 is the binary shannon entropy function .",
    "note that in our scheme , the final key is extracted from @xmath0-basis measurement results , so all the variables in equation   should be measured in the @xmath0 basis .",
    "the phase error rate @xmath17 can not be measured directly , which , instead , can be inferred from the error rate in the @xmath1 basis@xcite .",
    "the gain and qber , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , can be measured from the experiment directly .",
    "alice and bob need to estimate @xmath16 and @xmath17 for privacy amplification . according to the model reviewed in methods",
    ", we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the yield of single - photon components measured in the @xmath0 basis and background rate , respectively . in order to lower bound the key rate equation",
    ", one can lower bound @xmath24 , @xmath26 and upper bound @xmath17 .",
    "since that both the vacuum state and the single - photon state are basis independent , the yields of vacuum states and single - photon states in different bases are equal @xmath27 while a multi - photon state is basis dependent , whose basis information may be revealed to eve by , for example , pns attack@xcite , so for any @xmath28-photon state ( @xmath29 ) , in general , @xmath30 that is , depending on the basis information , eve may set the yield of @xmath28-photon state different for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bases . as for the error rates , the phase error probability in the @xmath0 basis equals to the bit error probability in the @xmath1 basis @xmath31 then , in the finite - key - size situation where",
    "statistical fluctuations should be taken into account@xcite , we have @xmath32 given @xmath33 , we can upper bound @xmath17 by the random sampling argument ( details shown in methods ) .",
    "we need to point out that even though the single - photon state is basis independent , the error rates in two basis may not be the same @xmath34 this can be easily seen by considering a simple intercept - and - resend attack where eve measures all the pulses in the @xmath0 basis , and then she will not introduce any additional error in the z basis @xmath35 , but @xmath36 .",
    "in our simulation , the parameters of the experimental setup are listed in table [ tab : mifluc : setuppara ] .",
    "statistical fluctuations are taken into account in the simulation ( details shown in methods ) .",
    "we compare the key generation rate in our scheme with that in the standard bb84 protocol with the vacuum+weak decoy - state scheme .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : mifluc : keyrate ] .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : mifluc : keyrate ] , the key rate of the proposed biased scheme is larger than that of the standard bb84 with vacuum+weak decoy states by at least @xmath2 . when the transmission loss is @xmath37 , the key rate improvement can go up to @xmath38 . as the transmission loss increases , the improvement of the biased scheme decreases .",
    "this is because at a larger transmission loss , more pulses for decoy states are needed and bob also needs a larger @xmath8 to estimate the privacy amplification part in eq .  .",
    "the improvement comes from the fact that @xmath39 is less than @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath39 approaches to @xmath4 , the biased scheme becomes similar to the original scheme , where @xmath40 .",
    "it is an interesting prospective question how to apply our scheme to qkd systems with high channel losses@xcite .    for a practical qkd system",
    ", one needs to optimize the bias @xmath39 for the key rate .",
    "the dependence of the optimal bias on the transmission loss is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mifluc : pz ] , from which we can see that the optimal @xmath41 is about 0.95 when the transmission loss is below @xmath42 db and decreases as the transmission loss increases . the minimal optimal @xmath41 is about 0.6 , which is close to 1/2 .",
    "that is why our scheme approaches the standard bb84 with the vacuum+weak decoy - state scheme as the transmission loss increases .",
    "in conclusion , we combine the decoy - state qkd with a biased basis choice to enhance the system performance . the key point of our scheme is increasing the raw data sift factor by setting all signal states in one ( @xmath0 ) basis .",
    "we take statistical fluctuations into account and use a rigorous method to upper bound the phase error rate of the single - photon components of the signal state . comparing the result with that in the standard decoy - state bb84 protocol",
    ", we find an improvement in the key generation rate .",
    "meanwhile , we reduce the complexity of the qkd system by assigning all signal states in the @xmath0 basis .",
    "define @xmath44 as the yield of an @xmath28-photon state ; @xmath45 as the transmittance of the channel measured in @xmath46 ; @xmath25 as the background count rate . then , in a normal channel when there is no eve s intervention , @xmath44 is given by : @xmath47      the error rate of @xmath28-photon states @xmath51 is given by @xmath52(1-y_{0 } ) } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the probability that a photon hits the erroneous detector and @xmath54 .",
    "the overall qber is given by @xmath55        here , we review the random sampling argument  @xcite : using the bit error rate measured in the @xmath1 basis , @xmath33 , to estimate the phase error rate in the @xmath0 basis , @xmath17 , for privacy amplification .    if the key size is infinite , we know that @xmath57 .",
    "otherwise , given @xmath33 , @xmath58 ( the number of decoy states that alice sends and bob measures in the @xmath1 basis ) , and @xmath59 ( the number of signal states that alice sends and bob measures in the @xmath0 basis ) , we can give a probabilistic upper bound of @xmath17 such that it is lower than @xmath17 with a small probability @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the deviation of the phase error rate from the tested value .",
    "here , @xmath60 is a controllable variable and is equal to @xmath63 in the simulation .",
    "we have @xmath64 where the function @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 . given @xmath60 , we compute the value of @xmath68 and find the value @xmath69 which is the root of equation  .",
    "we get the probabilistic upper bound + @xmath70      in this protocol , alice and bob use two decoy states to estimate the low bound of @xmath71 and the upper bound of @xmath72 .",
    "first , they implement a vacuum decoy state to estimate the background counts in signal states @xmath73      note that in our scheme all the parameters for estimating @xmath77 are measured in the @xmath0 basis and the parameters for estimating @xmath78 are measured in the @xmath1 basis . and we must lower bound @xmath25 to obtain the lower bound of the key rate@xcite",
    ". the @xmath78 we get here will substitute @xmath79 in equation  .",
    "the total number of pulses sent by alice is composed of four cases @xmath80 since that alice sends all signal states in the @xmath0 basis and the final key is only extracted from the data measured in the @xmath0 basis , the parameter @xmath11 in equation   is given by @xmath81 we follow the statistical fluctuation analysis proposed by ma _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
