    "the star detector subsystems @xcite relevant to jet analysis are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) immersed in a 0.5 t longitudinal magnetic field and used to reconstruct charged particle tracks with pseudorapidity @xmath9 , the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) with towers at @xmath10 and the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter ( eemc ) with towers at @xmath11 .",

    "they resulted in a 37% increase in jet acceptance over the 2006 run .",
    "upgrades in the data acquisition system , daq1000 , allowed star to record events at several hundred hz during the 2009 run , with only 5% dead time for the jet data , compared with 40 hz with 40% dead time during the 2006 run .",

    "many charged hadrons deposit a mip ( minimum ionizing particle ) , while others shower and deposit a sizeable fraction of their energy when passing through . the strategy adopted in analyses through 2006 was to subtract a mip from an emc tower with a charged track passing through . in the 2009 run",
    ", the total momentum of the charged track is subtracted from the struck emc tower .",
