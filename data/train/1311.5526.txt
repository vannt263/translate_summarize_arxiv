    "quantum spin ice has highlighted the quantum dynamics of emergent magnetic monopoles and the associated gauge fields  @xcite in frustrated pyrochlore magnets.@xcite in particular , the ground state of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 may be described as a u(1 ) quantum spin liquid hosting gapped bosonic spinon excitations carrying the monopole and fictitious gapless photon excitations  @xcite or a ferromagnetically ordered higgs phase achieved by a bose condensation of spinons.@xcite in the latter case , the u(1 ) gauge invariance associated with the global phase of spinon wavefunctions is spontaneously broken and the gauge fields and thus the fictitious photons acquire a mass through the anderson - higgs mechanism.@xcite this provides a magnetic analogue of superconductivity on the lattice problem as an ideal laboratory for addressing the lattice gauge theory  @xcite in the u(1 ) case . in the early study , a first - order phase transition was observed around @xmath7  k on powder samples of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3.@xcite however , the nature of the transition and the low - temperature phase have been the subject of intense debate.@xcite    an emergence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) order has been reported for a single - crystal sample studied by neutron diffraction measurements.@xcite polarized neutron - scattering experiments on the same single crystal have shown a full depolarization of the incident neutron spins indicating the formation of ferromagnetic domains.@xcite the paramagnetic state is well described with a magnetic coulomb liquid behavior characterized by the growth of a broadened pinch - point singularity  @xcite in the energy - integrated diffuse scattering profile with decreasing temperature,@xcite and the observed ordered structure well below the transition temperature @xmath8  k  @xcite is consistent with the theoretical prediction of a formation of nearly collinear ferromagnetic moments parallel to @xmath9 $ ] in the higgs phase.@xcite long - range magnetic order , however , has only been detected in the single crystals of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 studied in refs .   and  .",
    "there is a sharp anomaly in the temperature dependence of the specific heat , @xmath1 at @xmath4 in these crystals , while other single crystal samples have either a broader peak or no peak at all in @xmath1.@xcite a possible crystallographic and/or chemical disorder of the crystals including the effects of strain and stuffing , i.e. an excess of yb ions occupying the ti sites , that has been detected from exafs  @xcite and neutron - scattering studies,@xcite may explain this discrepancy .    given these contrasting results on single crystals , experiments on polycrystalline samples may provide key information to solve this problem .",
    "most authors report a sharp peak in @xmath1 at low - temperature for powder samples of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3,@xcite while the peak temperature ranges from 0.24 to 0.265  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c](a ) ) . muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) experiments on different powder samples have provided contradictory data : a short - time decay of the @xmath0sr asymmetry was observed at 0.2  k in an early study  @xcite indicating at least a near freezing of the magnetic moments , while this behavior was not observed in more recent work.@xcite moreover , long - range magnetic order has not been observed by neutron diffraction  @xcite and spin echo  @xcite experiments on polycrystalline yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , although magnetic bragg scattering at reciprocal lattice vectors are much harder to detect on powders than in single crystals .",
    "comprehensive investigations on both powder and single - crystal yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 are therefore required in order to resolve these controversies and to determine whether the ground state of quantum spin ice yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 belongs to a magnetic higgs phase or a u(1 ) quantum spin liquid .    in this paper , we present @xmath0sr and specific - heat measurements on both polycrystalline and high - quality single - crystal samples of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "a sharp maximum in the temperature dependence of the specific heat reveals the presence of a magnetic transition at a @xmath4 of 0.26 and 0.21  k for the powder and the single - crystal samples respectively , with a magnetic entropy released between 50  mk and 30  k that amounts to @xmath5 per yb .",
    "zero - field ( zf ) and longitudinal - field ( lf ) @xmath0sr measurements show that below @xmath4 , static magnetic moments exist in both samples .",
    "the magnetic volume fractions are estimated to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the powder and single crystal , respectively .",

    "the @xmath0sr measurements on our powder and single - crystal samples were performed using the musr spectrometer at isis where a pulse of muons with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath19  ns is produced every 20  ms .",
    "the samples were mounted on pure ag plates using general electric ( ge ) varnish and covered with silver foil .",
    "the samples were cooled to 50  mk in an oxford instruments @xmath14he-@xmath15he dilution refrigerator and the data were collected on heating .",
    "the 100% spin - polarized muons are implanted into a sample and after coming to rest the muon spin precesses in the local magnetic environment . the muons decay with a half - life of @xmath20s , emitting a positron preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay . two sets of detectors , up and down stream of the sample ,",

    "the asymmetry of the @xmath0sr time spectrum is then obtained as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents a relative counting efficiency of the forward and backward detectors.@xcite the data were normalized after subtracting a well characterized constant background signal in the asymmetry time spectra that arises from the high - purity silver sample holder . for the zf muon experiments , stray fields at the sample position were compensated to within @xmath25 t by an active compensation coils system .",
    "lf spectra were collected with magnetic fields up to 0.25  t applied along the direction of the incident muons .",
    "let us start with the temperature dependence of the zf asymmetry time spectra , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zfmusr ] for the powder and the single crystal .",
    "both data sets have been normalized by the value @xmath26 . in the case of the powder sample , the asymmetry shows an exponential decay with time at 0.5  k. this indicates that the yb spins are totally fluctuating in time , yielding a slow relaxation of the muon spins .",
    "the relaxation becomes faster with decreasing temperature down to 0.3  k. eventually , at 0.25  k , slightly below the @xmath4 determined from the @xmath1 data , the asymmetry exhibits a kink , which is characterized by a steep initial drop in a fast time domain within 0.5  @xmath0s , followed by a slow relaxation .",
    "the observation of an initial drop in the asymmetry indicates that the muon spins are depolarized more quickly than in the pulse duration of 70  ns .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the sample contains magnetic moments which are either static or quasi - static within the @xmath0sr time window 10  ps to 1  @xmath0s.@xcite our results on this powder sample are comparable with previous results on other polycrystalline samples.@xcite the single crystal shows similar behavior to our powder sample , but the relaxation of the muon spins is slightly slower at both 0.4 and 0.3  k. at @xmath27  k , we again observe a rapid initial drop in the asymmetry followed by a slow relaxation , although the size of the initial decrease in asymmetry is reduced from that of the powder .",
    "these @xmath0sr time spectra can be analyzed successfully by using a two - exponential relaxation function ,    @xmath28    with the first and second terms representing the fast and slow relaxation components , respectively , i.e. , the relaxation rate @xmath29 .",
    "this gives a minimal effective model for treating magnetic transitions and a magnetically ordered volume fraction in ordered phases.@xcite figure  [ fig : musr_ad](a ) shows the value of the initial asymmetry , @xmath30 , normalized by the value at 0.6  k , for the slowly relaxing component of both the powder and single - crystal samples .",
    "@xmath30 is nearly temperature independent at high temperatures , starts to decrease below 0.35 and 0.3  k for the powder and the single crystal respectively , and falls to an almost constant value below 0.2  k. note that @xmath30 reduces to about @xmath31 and @xmath32 of its high - temperature values for the powder and the single crystal , respectively .",
    "this means that the volume fraction of static or quasi - static magnetic moments is estimated to be nearly @xmath10 for the powder , since it is close to an ideal value @xmath33 , and about @xmath11 for the single crystal.@xcite figure  [ fig : musr_ad](b ) shows the relaxation rate @xmath34 for the slowly relaxing component of both the powder and single - crystal samples .",
    "the relaxation rates are almost the same at around 1  k , are gradually enhanced with decreasing temperature , reach the maximum around 0.25  k , and are nearly saturated at lower temperatures .",
    "however , @xmath34 for the powder data exhibits a stronger enhancement by a factor of about two , as compared with the single - crystal data .",
    "the peak of @xmath34 around 0.25  k indicates that the time scale of magnetic fluctuations is slowing down and crosses the @xmath0sr time window , 10  ps - 1  @xmath0s , around this temperature .",
    "although it is thought that the transition here is first - order , it is accompanied by a moderately high intensity of slow magnetic fluctuations .    to confirm that the `` nearly static magnetic moments '' observed with the zf @xmath0sr results are indeed static , we have also measured the asymmetry with longitudinal fields applied along the direction of the initial muon spin polarization .",
    "figures  [ fig : lfmusr](a ) and  [ fig : lfmusr](b ) show the lf @xmath0sr time spectra observed at 0.1 and 0.7  k on the powder sample and figs .",
    "[ fig : lfmusr](c ) and [ fig : lfmusr](d ) those at 0.075 and 0.7  k for the single crystal .",
    "again , all the curves are normalized by the value @xmath35 at zero field and then fit using eq .  .",
    "clearly , the slower relaxation rate @xmath34 decreases monotonously with increasing longitudinal field both well below and well above @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , at 0.7  k , the asymmetry still shows a single slow exponential time decay even in a magnetic field of 0.25  t. this indicates that all the yb spins are fluctuating and that some of the magnetic excitation spectra lie in the @xmath0sr time window in this field range . on the other hand , well below @xmath4 ( at 0.1  k for the powder and at 0.075  k for the single - crystal ) , with increasing field , the whole asymmetry spectra shows an upward parallel shift with no crossing .",
    "this shift is accompanied by a recovery of the initial loss in the asymmetry and a reduction of the long - time depolarization rate @xmath34 .",
    "this decoupling behavior seen in the time spectrum is typical for a case in which a static internal magnetic field appears at a muon site .",
    "namely , this provides evidence that the magnetic moments inside both the powder and single - crystal samples are indeed static . note that an observation of the muon spin precession is not necessary to draw this conclusion.@xcite    we can try to estimate the magnitude of the ordered internal magnetic field . to do this",
    "we follow a method used previously  @xcite and discussed in detail in ref .  , the equation adopted is    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the applied external field , and @xmath39 is the internal field at the muon site .",
    "there are certain conditions for this function to be applicable .",
    "the internal fields at muon sites must have the same amplitude but their directions at different sites throughout the sample may be random .",
    "these conditions can be realized in powder samples . adopting this method the magnitude of the ordered internal magnetic field for the polycrystalline sample",
    "can be estimated from the initial drop in the asymmetry at zero field to be @xmath40  mt . a similar calculation for the single - crystal sample gives a value of @xmath41  mt .",
    "this latter value must be treated with some caution given the limitations of the analysis discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , we included it here for completeness .",
    "we also note that the initial drop in the asymmetry eventually disappears at 0.25  t , which is actually of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "we now compare our results with previous work .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the results of zf @xmath0sr measurements on a powder sample .",
    "their results are in reasonable agreement with ours , but are insufficient to conclude that the magnetic moments in the sample are either static or quasi - static , because they did not perform lf @xmath0sr measurements .",
    "our lf @xmath0sr data for the powder sample are quite similar to those obtained by de rotier _",
    "_ , although the presence of a clear minimum in their relaxation data at short times led them to suggest that the muons were detecting a field distribution influenced by disorder , and that this disorder probably resulted from the geometrical frustration of the magnetic interactions.@xcite they used a gaussian - broadened gaussian function that assumed that the muons see different environments , each of them characterized by a dynamical kubo - toyabe function , to fit their data and concluded that yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 presents dynamical short - range correlations at low - temperature .",
    "there is no strong evidence for a shallow minimum at short times in the lf relaxation data for our powder sample , although there is a hint of such a dip in the data collected in 0.03  t ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lfmusr]a ) .",
    "we see no dip the lf asymmetry spectra for the single - crystal .",
    "as discussed above , our data are consistent with the moments being static , while a disordered but static scenario is precluded by the absence of any residual magnetic entropy at the lowest temperature in our heat capacity data .",
    "recently , dortenzio _ et al .",
    "_ also performed zf and transverse - field @xmath0sr experiments on different powder and single - crystal samples.@xcite however , their asymmetry time spectra never show any significant difference in the initial ( @xmath42 ) value between at 1  k and 16  mk , which are strikingly different from those obtained by hodges _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and in our work . the differences between our @xmath0sr results and those of ref",
    "could be ascribed to a sample dependence issue . in particular , the specific heat of single crystals strongly depends on the sample . for the single crystals studied in refs .   and",
    ", @xmath1 only exhibits a broad bump followed by a large tail continuing down to 0.1  k , at which temperature the value of @xmath1 is about five times larger than that of our powder sample ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] ) .",
    "the single - crystal @xmath1 data of ref .  , in which long - range magnetic order was not observed with neutron scattering,@xcite has a peak at 0.26 and broad shoulder around 0.20  k. to the best of our knowledge , @xmath0sr experiments have not been reported on this sample .",
    "our single - crystal exhibits a single sharp peak in @xmath1 at @xmath43  k. the magnitude of @xmath1 at 0.1  k is still double that of our powder sample .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the estimated @xmath11 for the static magnetic volume fraction of our single - crystal sample compared with an almost perfect ( @xmath10 ) magnetic volume fraction for our powder sample .    in the case of powder samples , the differences between our @xmath0sr results and those of ref .",
    "can not simply be understood from the behavior of the specific heat , since the different powder samples used for our work , by yaouanc _ et al._,@xcite , and by dortenzio _",
    "et al._,@xcite all exhibit similar anomalies in @xmath1 at the temperature of @xmath44  k which is higher than the @xmath1 anomaly reported in the early powder work  @xcite as well as for our single crystal , see fig .  [",
    "fig : c ] .",
    "finally we note that in the case of the first - order phase transition expected here , measurements of @xmath1 made using a heat pulse - relaxation method may not fully determine the true peak height , since one needs to measure the latent heat .",
    "our results provide compelling evidence that in both our powder and single - crystal samples of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , the yb moments undergo long - range magnetic order below @xmath4 ( @xmath44  k for the powder and @xmath43  k for the single crystal ) .",
    "the @xmath0sr results indicate the formation of static magnetic moments , while the loss of magnetic entropy from high temperature to well below @xmath4 indicates that these static magnetic moments are ordered .",
    "the data are consistent with our previous observations on the same single - crystal sample of a ferromagnetic order with an extremely slow relaxation by neutron diffraction  @xcite and polarized diffuse neutron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the low - frequency magnetic excitation spectral density within the @xmath0sr time window below @xmath4 is compatible with a higgs mechanism by which pyrochlore `` photons '' acquire an energy gap due to a coupling to spinons that carry emergent magnetic monopoles .  @xcite    uncertainties in estimating both the magnetically static volume fraction using @xmath0sr and the magnetic entropy associated with order from heat capacity data , leave open the possibility that either a fraction of the magnetic moments throughout the bulk of the sample , or all the moments in some macroscopic portion of the samples ( especially for the single - crystal ) , remain dynamic or disordered . using the data presented here , it is problematic to comment on the structure of the magnetic order , i.e. whether it is a simple ferromagnet or has a ferromagnetic component . why some samples , and particularly some single - crystals , appear to exhibit long - range magnetic order while others do",
    "not also remains an open issue .",
    "clearly more research , and especially work which correlates the low - temperature magnetic properties with the structure and chemistry of yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 will be required , before the properties of this fascinating and important material are fully understood .",
