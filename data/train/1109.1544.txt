    "<S> we perform scanning - gate microscopy on a quantum - point contact . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined in a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas of an algaas / gaas heterostructure , giving rise to a weak disorder potential . </S>",
    "<S> the lever arm of the scanning tip is significantly smaller than that of the split gates defining the conducting channel of the quantum - point contact . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to observe that the conducting channel is shifted in real space when asymmetric gate voltages are applied . </S>",
    "<S> the observed shifts are consistent with transport data and numerical estimations .    quantum - point contacts ( qpcs ) are the building blocks of most electronic nanostructures . despite their conceptual simplicity , they show intriguing properties like quantized conductance @xcite and rich many - body physics @xcite . local - probe techniques like scanning - gate microscopy ( sgm ) proved to be particularly powerful tools to extract a wealth of information about qpcs and two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in general @xcite .    with the advent of high - mobility samples and the discovery of very fragile quantum effects  most notable the 5/2-fractional quantum hall state  </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to gain a quantitative understanding of local potential fluctuations in the 2deg and the behavior of quantum states , in particular edge channels , in a qpc . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , conventional transport experiments were performed in which asymmetric top - gate voltages were used to tune the potential landscape in the qpc channel @xcite . here , we use sgm to image and quantify the shift of the conducting qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> this is an essential part in understanding the influence of top - gates on the underlying high - mobility 2deg .    . </S>",
    "<S> up to 13 conductance steps appear as hyperbolic - shaped features in the plane of the two top gates . </S>",
    "<S> we define the asymmetry in top gate voltages as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the white circles are points at the indicated values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the distances of the conducting qpc channel to the left and right top gates as described in the main text below . </S>",
    "<S> inset : topography of a nominally identical qpc ( discussed in ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the channel formed by the two top gates with applied voltages @xmath4 and @xmath5 has a width of 200 nm . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) depletion curve of the qpc under investigation here as a function of top - gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> depletion under the top gates is reached for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> conductance steps are smeared out because of the rather high temperature of @xmath7 . close to pinch - off , a weak 0.7-anomaly is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the qpc is pinched off at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) conductance of the qpc as a function of tip voltage @xmath9 for a tip height of 50 nm above the gates and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] ]    the sample under investigation is a high - mobility gaas - qpc with mobilities of more than @xmath11 at temperatures below 4.2 k. the measurements were performed at temperatures of around 10 k where mobilities are lower . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density is @xmath12 with a corresponding fermi wavelength of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the 2deg resides in a quantum well ( qw ) which is buried 160 nm below the surface . in order to reach these high mobilities , the qw is symmetrically @xmath14-doped with si - donors at depths of 70 nm and 250 nm . remaining donor electrons which do not contribute to the 2deg fill states in the @xmath15-valleys of alas layers close to the doping planes . </S>",
    "<S> two further si donor layers at 40 nm and 680 nm are expected to partially form dx - centers ; their purpose is to compensate for surface states and substrate impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the gating properties of this kind of heterostructures are described in detail in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> it is not obvious _ a priori _  in particular because of hysteresis effects @xcite  whether sgm would work on such a device .    </S>",
    "<S> the qpc is formed by two metallic top gates which form a gap of width @xmath16 as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](a ) . at low temperatures , conductance plateaus spaced by @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> appear when the top gates are used to pinch off the conducting qpc channel . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](a ) , such a pinch - off curve is shown for a device of ( nominally ) identical geometry @xcite . the differential conductance @xmath18 is measured in four - terminal configuration via lock - in technique . after numerical derivation with respect to the gate voltages @xmath5 and @xmath4 , the transconductance @xmath19 ( along the bisecting line of the plane ) is shown in color as a function of the voltages applied to the two top gates . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance steps show up as hyperbolicly shaped curves of elevated transconductance . </S>",
    "<S> we define the asymmetry of top - gate voltages as @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> if we apply the same voltages to both top gates , we denote this with just @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> conductance quantization is barely visible for the qpc under investigation here because of the elevated temperature , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 2deg below the top gates is depleted at @xmath22 and the qpc channel is formed . </S>",
    "<S> it is pinched off at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that these are about the same values as for the reference device shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](a ) and discussed in ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> we place the metallic tip of our home - built cryogenic atomic - force microscope 50 nm above the qpc channel ( height above the metallic gates ) and use it as a local gate by applying a voltage @xmath9 to the tip @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> negative tip voltages lead to a decrease in qpc conductance as expected and shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](c ) . extrapolating the linear behavior of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](d ) leads to an estimated pinch - off voltage of @xmath23 which can not be reached in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the experiment performed by topinka _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which was interpreted in terms of backscattering of electrons off a tip - induced depletion pivot . </S>",
    "<S> we define the lever arms @xmath24 of the top gates and the tip as the slope of the curves ( in the linear regime ) in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] ( b ) and ( c ) and extract @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the values for @xmath27 vary by a factor of @xmath28 depending on the value of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath29 is very small . </S>",
    "<S> this may result from the particular sample design and the 2deg being deep below the surface embedded between special doping layers .    </S>",
    "<S> we now perform sgm , meaning that we fix the top - gate and tip voltages and scan the tip at a constant height above the qpc . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the spatially resolved current map shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted lines trace the edges of the top gates . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainity of the alignment of the sgm image and the edges of the gates as determined from electrostatic - force microscoy corresponds roughly to the geometric width of the qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> since the tip is negatively biased at @xmath30 and the current @xmath31 is mainly determined by the conductance of the qpc , we expect the current to decrease when the tip approaches the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> the overall behavior does indeed follow the expectation . unexpectedly , however , we find a spot of less suppressed current close to the center of the qpc where the two dashed lines cross in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will speculate on its physical origin below . </S>",
    "<S> the current map is asymmetric , i.e. lines of constant current have an elliptic shape . </S>",
    "<S> this might reflect the tip shape . </S>",
    "<S> however , since this asymmetry is aligned with the gate arrangement , we consider it more likely to be due to a screening effect of the tip - induced potential by the gates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig02](b ) presents line cuts along the horizontal and vertical dashed lines of the sgm image in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current decreases when the tip approaches the qpc until it increases again yielding a local current maximum which reflects the spot of less suppressed current of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the width @xmath32 of the tip - induced potential is extracted by fitting the outer data points ( blue data points without the enhanced current ) with a lorentzian curve of the form @xmath33 , where we interpret @xmath34 as the position of the qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> the fits yield a width of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the horizontal and vertical cuts , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller value of @xmath37 is expected because the tip - induced potential is wider than the qpc channel and is therefore affected by screening of the gates @xcite .    in order to further explore the properties of the qpc , we scan the tip along the horizontal dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02](a ) and change the asymmetry @xmath1 according to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry then follows the dashed line in the plane of the two gate voltages in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](a ) , where the average current of each horizontal line was subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , one expects that the qpc channel is shifted laterally if the gate - voltage asymmetry is changed  for more negative @xmath1 the channel is pressed to the right and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior was indeed theoretically predicted @xcite and experimental results were interpreted assuming such a shift @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a direct experimental observation of a shift has not been shown yet .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurement shows , firstly , that the position of the spot of less suppressed current is observed at @xmath39 ( black , dashed line ) , independent of gate asymmetry ( within the experimental accuracy ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore speculate that this spot is due to the geometrical arrangement of the gate electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , @xmath40 should depend on @xmath1 ; in particular , @xmath40 should shift in parallel to @xmath34 ( see below ) if the spot was due to a certain tip geometry . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the overall decrease in current  measured by @xmath34 as explained below  is shifted to the left for more positive @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be observed more clearly when looking at the line cuts for @xmath41 presented in panel ( b ) : the local maxima of all curves indicating @xmath40 coincide with each other ( vertical dashed line ) , but the overall decrease in current is shifted to the left for increasing asymmetry as intuitively expected .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , a seeming shift of the position of a quantum dot was identified as being due to electrostatic effects ; a real physical shift of the quantum dot could not be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> here , we observe a physical shift of the qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> if the shift was due to electrostatic effects , @xmath40 would show the same shift . since this is not the case , </S>",
    "<S> the observed shift of the qpc channel is physical .    </S>",
    "<S> we follow the procedure described above for extracting the magnitude of the shift : fitting the decrease in current with a lorentzian yields @xmath34 which we normalize such that @xmath42 for @xmath43 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](c ) , the position of the qpc channel extracted from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](a ) for seven different gate - voltage asymmetries is plotted ( red circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total shift is @xmath44 in the investigated range of asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the qpc channel can also be estimated from the transport data presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the seven circles correspond to the gate - voltage asymmetries for which the shift was determined from the sgm data . the width @xmath45 of the qpc channel can be estimated from @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of conducting qpc modes . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distance @xmath3 from the channel center to the right top - gate edge is then estimated by half the fermi wavelength times the number of modes that are added by following the dotted horizontal line until the 2deg below the right top gate is not depleted anymore at @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields the distance @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding analysis gives @xmath50 for the distance from the channel center to the left top - gate edge . </S>",
    "<S> the sum @xmath51 is slightly larger than the separation @xmath16 of the two gates . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is repeated for the other six data points . </S>",
    "<S> the channel position is then defined as @xmath52 and normalized as above . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the qpc channel extracted this way are also plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](c ) as green squares . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between both methods  despite the rough estimate for the width of the qpc channel  is very good and supports the assumption that a lateral shift of the qpc is both induced and detected in the presented experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main result of this paper .    for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we compare our experimental data with the analytic prediction for the total potential @xmath53 in the plane of the 2deg from ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath54-axis is parallel to the dashed line in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01](a ) ; the @xmath55-axis is the normal to the surface of the semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath56 is then the sum of two contributions of different origins , @xmath57 where the first contribution depends on the gate voltages @xmath58 with characteristic functions @xmath59 and the second is due to charged donors in the slit between the gates . </S>",
    "<S> this function has a minimum along the @xmath54-axis within the slit which forms the qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> its position @xmath34 depends on the gate voltages and can thus be shifted as a function of asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the minima for the parameters of our sample and the different gate asymmetries ; the result is shown as blue stars in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kink at @xmath60 occurs because in the model the qpc shift can not exceed the width @xmath16 of the qpc , i.e. @xmath61 . theory and experiment agree within a factor of 2 which is reasonably good . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical overestimation of the shift is due to the following two reasons : ( i ) in the theory , the length of the qpc channel is assumed to be much longer than its width @xmath62 and the depth of the 2deg is assumed to be marginal compared to the width @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are experimentally not fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the x - electrons and the 2deg itself can ( self - consistently ) screen the influence of the gates @xcite  a possibility which is not implemented in the theory .    finally , we want to comment on the physical origin of the spot of less suppressed current inside the qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that its position @xmath40 is independent of applied gate voltages indicates that the origin is linked to the topographic gate - electrode arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the tip - induced potential may be screened efficiently by the gates at the spot such that the current through the qpc increases . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative , more subtle explanation is that the precise tuning of the qpc at the spot leads to a parallel conductance of @xmath15-electrons . such an effect has been observed in conventional transport for certain gate voltages @xcite .    in conclusion , we presented scanning - gate measurements on a qpc processed on a high - mobility al@xmath63ga@xmath64as heterostructure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments proved that it is possible to perform sgm on such a structure which is not obvious because of hysteretic effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was not possible to deplete the 2deg underneath the tip completely . </S>",
    "<S> this may open new possiblities to perform future experiments in the weakly invasive regime . in sgm images , </S>",
    "<S> an unexpected spot of less suppressed current showed up close to the center of the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> its origin has not been completely understood yet but is probably due to a screening effect . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we imaged directly how the qpc channel shifts when different asymmetric gate voltages were applied . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with an estimate from direct transport data gives excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with a theoretical model neglecting self - consistent effects is reasonable and deviations are qualitatively understood . for the future , sgm on high - mobility structures can be used to locally investigate electron - electron interactions @xcite  this is of particular interest when these structures are tuned into the ( fractional ) quantum hall regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results presented here suggest that this endeavor should be feasible . </S>"
