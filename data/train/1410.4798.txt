    "these effects are usually parametrised by contact interactions , which are local , non - renormalisable operators .",
    "for instance , the process @xmath5 can be sensitive to the four fermion operator [ atlas ] _ q = u , d(^p_l q ) ( ^p_l ) where @xmath6 . with 20 fb@xmath7 of data at 8 tev in the centre - of - mass frame",

    "various recent papers @xcite have explored what can be learned from contact interaction studies , if the lhc finds no new particles .",
    "two difficulties arise in attempting to apply currently available contact interaction ( ci ) bounds to specific new physics ( np ) models : + * 1 ) * experimental limits exist only for a selection of cis , among the large collection labelled by the chirality , flavour and gauge charge of participating fermions , as well as the lorentz structure of the interaction . since the magnitude and sign of the interference with the standard model ( sm ) depends on these labels , it is improbable that an available limit will be applicable to the interactions induced by a particular model . +",
    "* 2 ) * in the sensitivity range of colliders , it is unlikely that the ci approximation ( that @xmath10 for the heavy mediating particle ) is satisfied in any but the most strongly coupled of models .",
    "a non - local , or `` form factor '' parametrisation of the distribution tails might address both points : with a judicious choice of functional form , it may include non - local interactions mediated by propagating particles , and its coefficients may be simply calculated in many models . in this paper , we focus on the process @xmath11 at the lhc , and parametrise the @xmath12 cross - section as : = ( 1 + a + b )  , [ dream ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are coefficients to be determined , respectively of mass dimension -2 , -4 , -2 , @xmath16 is the drell - yann ( dy ) cross - section for @xmath17 exchange .",

    "then section [ sec : ptoff ] argues that for a generic model , @xmath21 and @xmath15 can be estimated from the partonic cross - section with simple approximations to the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",

    "constraints on leptoquarks @xcite and contact interactions involving two quarks and two leptons have been widely studied @xcite , both from precision and collider data .",

    "( [ dream ] ) with @xmath22 , was proposed in @xcite to address the first problem above .",
    "our form - factor generalisation is perhaps an old - fashioned version of `` simplified models''@xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to justify replacing @xmath8 as the coefficient of a four - fermion operator , by the non - local coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "we focus on a particular model , a scalar leptoquark @xmath24 with interaction @xmath25@xcite , and argue that the partonic cross - section is better approximated by an expansion in @xmath26 than in @xmath27 .",
    "we imagine this could be generalised to any particle exchanged in the @xmath1-channel , and will discuss multiple particle exchange in a later publication .",
    "the partonic cross - section for @xmath28 , mediated by neutral gauge bosons and @xmath1-channel @xmath24 exchange , is : _ lq & = & _ dy + [ sighlq ] where the gauge bosons are taken to be the massless @xmath29 with couplings @xmath30 , because @xmath31 .",

[ lqff ] and are plotted in figure [ fig : rxs ] . already two terms give a reasonable fit to the exact result , and are only slightly more complicated than a ci , so we opt for the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ dream ] ) , despite that in principle , form factors can be the most general functions of the available variables , restricted only by symmetries .",
    "notice that for @xmath34 , we could also expand @xmath35 , which corresponds to parametrising leptoquark exchange by a tower of local operators , including dimension - eight cis @xmath36 .",
    "but this expansion is less useful , because it fails in the regime @xmath37 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : rxs ] by the black lines exiting the top and bottom of the plots .",
    "the continous black line is @xmath38 expanded to second order in @xmath27 ( the ci approximation ) , and the dashed line includes third order in @xmath27 .",
    "this poor convergence motivates our interest in form factors , as opposed to cis .",
    "so we are abandonning the theoretical attractions of the operator product expansion and local effective field theory@xcite , because there is insufficient hierarchy between @xmath20 and @xmath39 to justify truncating the expansion in local operators at the lowest orders .",
    "a curious feature of eq . ( [ lqff ] ) is the @xmath40 contribution to the @xmath41 term , which is usually @xcite absent in the ci approximation .",
    "this neglect is justified , because the ci limit is @xmath42 , and colliders are sensitive to ci with @xmath43 , which implies @xmath44 . in the case of form factors , it is convenient to neglect this contribution in our preliminary analytic estimates eqns ( [ 8b ] ) -([eq2.1.14 ] ) , but we will see that it should be included",

    "however , this depends on pdfs , binning and the particle s properties , so we will discuss in a later publication the prospects of extracting the properties of the resonance from a form factor parametrisation of the cross - section .",

    "the approximation of neglecting the @xmath71 term ( see the end of section [ sec : civsff ] ) allows a clear distinction between the model - dependent constants @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the free parameters @xmath72 which we wish to constrain . in the next section , data will give allowed ellipses in @xmath21 space , for particular values of @xmath73 .",
