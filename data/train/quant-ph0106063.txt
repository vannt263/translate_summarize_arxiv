    "_ information _ , to be useful , must be encoded in the state of a physical system .",
    "thus , although information can have more than one meaning , it always has something to say about the state of the system it is encoded in .",
    "conversely , the average information needed to specify the state of a system drawn at random from some known probability distribution is proportional to the _ entropy _ of the corresponding statistical mechanical `` system '' .",
    "it follows that entropy can be understood as a measure of the system s information storage capacity .",
    "the physics of information is a fertile area of research which promises to become increasingly important as computers and nanotechnology approach the limits of what is physically possible @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "information is usually binary encoded into an array of two - state systems , each of which can hold one bit of data , where the two `` states '' correspond to the minimum or maximum value of a continuous degree of freedom .",
    "ordinarily such physical _ bits _ obey classical mechanics , but many examples of two - state quantum systems are known , for example adjacent pairs of energy levels in atoms , photon polarizations , or the magnetic dipole orientations of fermions .",
    "these quantum bits , or _ qubits _ as they are called , have a number of distinctive and nonintuitive properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the number of parameters needed to specify ( the statistics of measurement outcomes on ) the _ joint _ state of an array of @xmath3 qubits is generally @xmath4  exponentially larger than the @xmath3 needed for an array of classical bits !",
    "these new degrees of freedom are due to the existence of non - separable or _",
    "entangled _ states , which may be thought of as providing direct paths between pairs of states related by flipping more than one bit at a time .",
    "a further mysterious property of these quantum states stems from the fact that it is impossible ( so far as is known ! ) to determine just where on the pathways between states the qubits are .",
    "this is because the act of _ measuring _ the qubits states ( however this may be done ) always `` collapses '' them into one of their extremal states @xcite .",
    "a _ quantum computer _ is an array of distinguishable qubits that can be put into a known state , evolved under a sequence of precisely controlled interactions , and then measured .",
    "it has been shown that such a computer , _ if _ one could be built , would be able to solve certain problems asymptotically more rapidly than any classical device .",
    "unfortunately , quantum systems are exceedingly difficult to isolate , control and monitor , so that at this time only simple prototype quantum computers have been operated in the laboratory . although far from competitive with today s laptops , these prototypes are of great scientific interest .",
    "this is because quantum computers provide a paradigm for the study of a number of poorly understood issues in quantum mechanics , including _",
    "why _ the particular classical world we inhabit is singled out from the myriads allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "this is widely believed to be the result of _ decoherence _ : the decay of accessible information due to the entanglement generated by the interactions between the system with its environment @xcite .",
    "the reason such issues are poorly understood , even though the microscopic laws of quantum mechanics are complete and exact , lies in our very limited ability to integrate these laws into precise solutions for large and complex quantum systems , or even to gain significant insights into their long - term statistical behavior .",
    "the intrinsic complexity of quantum dynamics is in fact precisely what makes quantum computers so powerful to begin with",

    ", we shall limit ourselves to the qubit interactions most often encountered in physical implementations , namely the interaction between the magnetic dipoles of spin @xmath0 particles such as electrons , neutrons and certain atomic nuclei .",
    "these will be assumed to have fixed positions , so their spatial degrees of freedom can be ignored .",
    "examples of such systems , often involving @xmath5 or more spins ( qubits ) , are widely encountered in chemistry and condensed matter physics , and can readily be studied by various spectroscopies , most notably nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite .",
    "it will be assumed in the following that the reader has at least a basic familiarity with geometric algebra , as found in e.g.@xcite .",
    "this brief account of the msta is intended mainly to introduce the notation of the paper , while at the same time providing a taste of how the msta applies to quantum information processing .",
    "more introductory accounts may be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-particle msta is the geometric algebra @xmath6 generated by @xmath3 copies of minkowski space - time @xmath7 .",
    "we let @xmath8 denote a basis set of vector generators for this algebra , satisfying @xmath9 the superscripts refer to separate particle spaces ( @xmath10 ) and the subscripts label spacetime vectors ( @xmath11 ) , while @xmath12 is the standard minkowski metric of signature @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 can be thought of as a basis for relativistic _ configuration space _ , and the msta is the geometric algebra of this space .",
    "the even subalgebra of each copy of the spacetime algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of euclidean three - dimensional space @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the specific map depends on a choice of timelike vector , and the algebra then describes the rest space defined by that vector .",
    "it is convenient in most applications to identify this vector with @xmath16 , and we define @xmath17 each set of _ spatial vectors _ @xmath18 generates a three - dimensional geometric algebra .",
    "it is easily seen that the generators of different particle spaces _ commute _ , so that the algebra they generate is isomorphic to the kronecker product @xmath19 . for this paper we will work almost entirely within this ( non - relativistic ) space , but it should be borne in mind throughout that all results naturally sit in a fully relativistic framework .    to complete our definitions , we denote the pseudoscalar for each particle by @xmath20 for the bivectors in each spatial algebra we make the abbreviation @xmath21 .",
    "the reverse operation in the msta is denoted with a tilde .",
    "this flips the sign of both vectors and bivectors in @xmath15 , and so does not correspond to spatial reversion .",
    "there are many ways to represent multiparticle states within the msta . here",
    "we are interested in an approach which directly generalizes that of hestenes for single - particle non - relativistic states .",
    "we will represent states using multivectors constructed from products of the even subalgebras of each @xmath15 .",
    "that is , states are constructed from sums and products of the set @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 runs over all particle spaces .",
    "this algebra has real dimension @xmath25 , which is reduced to the expected @xmath26 by enforcing a consistent representation for the unit imaginary .",
    "this is ensured by right - multiplying all states with the _ correlator _ idempotent @xmath27 the correlator is said to be _ idempotent _ because it satisfies the projection relation @xmath28 in the case of two spins , for example , we have @xmath29 , so that any term right - multiplied by @xmath30 is projected by @xmath31 back to the same element .",
    "the correspondence with the usual complex vector space representation is obtained by observing that ( for e.g.  two spins ) every spinor may be written uniquely as @xmath32 where the @xmath33 are `` complex numbers '' of the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 real , and the role of the imaginary is played by the ( non - simple ) bivector @xmath37 the complex generator @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 , which ensures consistency with the standard formulation of quantum theory . as in the single - particle case ,",
    "the complex structure is always represented by _ right - multiplication _ by @xmath38 .",
    "while this approach may look strange at first , it does provide a number of new geometric insights into the nature of multiparticle hilbert space @xcite .",
    "as an application of the msta approach , we consider a simple model system of interacting qubits .",
    "this exhibits all of the complexity of multiparticle quantum systems generally , including the role of entanglement and the distinction between classical and quantum theories .",

    "the spin operators are simply @xmath49 where the @xmath50 are the pauli matrix operators .",
    "the classical energy of  ( [ clse ] ) gives rise to a quantum hamiltonian containing 2 terms .",
    "the first involves @xmath51 , which is replaced by the operator @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the gyromagnetic ratios of particles 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "this operator acts on a four - dimensional complex vector space . to form the msta equivalent of this we write @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an ( uninterpreted ) imaginary unit .",
    "each factor of @xmath57 has an equivalent action in the msta given by left - multiplication with @xmath58 in the corresponding particle s space .",
    "it follows that we can replace @xmath59 we can already see , therefore , that the hamiltonian is going to become a 4-vector in the msta .     between them , and the angle @xmath60 it makes with the dipole ( left ) ; corresponding potential energy surface ( assuming the dipoles are confined to the plane as depicted on the left ) showing that there are two minima , two maxima , and four saddle points ( right ) . ]     between them , and the angle @xmath60 it makes with the dipole ( left ) ; corresponding potential energy surface ( assuming the dipoles are confined to the plane as depicted on the left ) showing that there are two minima , two maxima , and four saddle points ( right ) . ]    for the second term we let @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 is the unit vector parallel to the line between the dipoles centers .",
    "we next form the operator for @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 the msta equivalent of this is simply @xmath65 the role of the hamiltonian in the msta is therefore assumed by the 4-vector @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "this definition of @xmath69 is chosen so that schrdinger s equation takes the simple form @xmath70 > from this one can immediately see a key feature of the msta approach , which is that all references to the tensor product have been removed .",
    "all one ever needs is the geometric product , which inherits all of the required properties from the relativistic definition of the msta .      in the more conventional , matrix - based approach to quantum theory",
    "the propagator in the current setup would be simply @xmath71 . in finding the msta equivalent of this",
    "we appear to have a serious problem . in equation  ( [ sche ] )",
    "the 4-vector @xmath69 acts from the left on @xmath72 , whereas @xmath73 sits on the right .",
    "in fact , this is more of a notational issue than a foundational one .",
    "we simply define an operator @xmath74 to denote right - multiplication by @xmath73 when acting on a multiparticle state , namely @xmath75 we are then free to write @xmath74 anywhere we chose within a multiplicative term , and to let it distribute over addition like a multiplicative operator .",
    "this notational device is extremely useful in practice , though occasionally one has to be careful in applying it .",
    "the propagator can be obtained in a number of ways .",
    "one is to write @xmath76 where @xmath77 the multivector @xmath78 constitutes a geometric representation of the particle interchange operator , since @xmath79 , and hence satisfies @xmath80 .",

    "in addition , up to now we have only applied the propagator to spinors , where the complex structure is given by right - multiplication with @xmath73 .",
    "such a representation is not appropriate for density operators , because to apply it we would have to decompose our density operator into a sum over an ensemble of known pure states , apply the propagator to each state s spinor , and then rebuild the density operator from the transformed ensemble .",
    "this is clearly undesirable , so we should re - think the role of the imaginary in the propagator for the density operator .    to do this , we must first understand the role of @xmath56 in the propagator , where it appears multiplying the ( hermitian ) hamiltonian @xmath186 .",
    "the terms in @xmath187 involving odd numbers of particles have an immediate counterpart in the msta as products of odd numbers of bivectors .",
    "these exponentiate straightforwardly in the msta , and here the role of the imaginary as a pseudoscalar is clear .",
    "it is the terms in @xmath187 involving even numbers of particles which are the problem .",
    "when these are converted to products of even numbers of bivectors , a single factor of @xmath56 is left over . to see its effect we return to a pure state and consider @xmath188",
    "thus we see that , applied to density operators ( or any other observables ) , the imaginary unit interchanges even and odd terms ( in their number of bivectors ) , in addition to squaring to @xmath189 .",
    "it follows that the left - over factor of @xmath56 in the even terms converts them to odd terms , thereby ensuring that the hamiltonian generates a compact group while at the same time _ labeling _ these terms to keep them separate from the original odd terms .",
    "this is quite different from other occurrences of the imaginary !",
    "a simple way to represent this in the even msta is to introduce a `` formal '' imaginary unit @xmath190 , and to redefine the even msta density operator as @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "then , provided any residual factors of the even msta operator @xmath74 are replaced by @xmath190 , everything works simply . in writing @xmath194 in this way we have also recovered a more standard , hermitian representation , which permits the mean expectation values of any observable @xmath195 to be computed by essentially the usual formula : @xmath196 the geometric interpretation of this new imaginary operator @xmath190",
    "will be further considered on a subsequent occasion .",
    "we are now ready to see how things look to one spin when no information about the other(s ) is available .",
    "clearly this depends on the ( unknown ! ) configuration of the other spin(s ) , and we expect that the `` generic '' case will result in a very complicated trajectory , which may also be _ incoherent _ in the sense that the length of the spin vector is not preserved . somewhat surprisingly , the situation is simplified substantially by assuming that the spin of interest has an environment consisting of a great many others , whose dynamics are so complex that their spin vectors can be treated as completely random . under these circumstances , neither the exact starting state of the environment , nor any subsequent change in it , will change the way our chosen spin ( henceforth numbered @xmath197 ) sees it . as a result of this assumption and the linearity of quantum dynamics , we need only figure out how its basis states @xmath198 evolve in order to determine its evolution in general .    to see how the @xmath199 evolve , we return to the propagator of equation  ( [ prop1 ] ) , which we now write in the form @xmath200 the phase term has no effect , and for the interchange term we find that @xmath201 we then need to apply the term in @xmath202 .",
    "this commutes with @xmath78 , so we only need to transform the separate bivectors . for the case of @xmath203",
    "this final term has no effect , and we have @xmath204 for @xmath205 we need the result @xmath206 combining this with the preceding we see that @xmath207 with a similar result holding for @xmath208 .    as a simple model , suppose that our initial state is described by a known state of particle  1 , encoded in the density operator @xmath209 , and with the state of the second spin taken to be totally random .",
    "to evolve the density matrix of particle  1 we write @xmath210 and evolve each term as above .",
    "we then project @xmath211 back into the first particle space ( by throwing out any terms involving other spins ) and reform the polarization vector .",
    "we then find that : @xmath212 of course , the same result is obtained if everything is rotated to some other orientation , for example if the other spin is along @xmath106 and @xmath117 is replaced by the rotated spin vector .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the spin , which measures how much information about its state has been lost to the environment , is given ( in bits ) by @xmath213 the signed lengths of the spin polarization vectors and the corresponding von neumann entropies are plotted in fig .",

    "we have also seen how information on the state of a qubit can be lost through its interactions with an environment , although the poncaire recurrence times for the simple one - qubit environments we have considered are short enough to allow us to also see the underlying periodic behavior .",
    "this constitutes the simplest case of an old and venerable problem in solid - state nmr spectroscopy , which is to predict the spectral line - shape ( decay envelope ) of a _",
    "macroscopic _ system of dipole - coupled spins such as calcium fluoride @xcite .",
    "here an exact treatment is out of the question , since the analytic evaluation of even the three - spin propagator is a reasonably challenging ( though solvable ) problem .",
    "nevertheless , we believe the insights provided by geometric algebra , particularly into the constants of the motion , offer the hope of further progress .",
    "more generally , quantum mechanical explanations of apparently irreversible processes are becoming increasingly important in many fields @xcite , and further have the potential to finally clarify in just what sense classical mechanics can be regarded as a limiting case of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these problems typically involve the spatial degrees of freedom , and hence are truly infinite dimensional .",
    "most of what is known about _ decoherence _ in such systems therefore comes from the analysis of simple and highly tractable environmental models such as a bath of spins or harmonic oscillators . because of its potential to provide global insights into the full spacetime structure of such models",
