    "the set of faces of a ( central ) hyperplane arrangement , and more generally the set of covectors of an oriented matroid , provide an important source of examples in the class of finite monoids known as",
    "_ left regular bands_. such monoids have been the focus of much research interest , following the celebrated work of bidigare , hanlon and rockmore  @xcite who showed that a number of well - known markov chains , including the tsetlin library and the riffle shuffle , are random walks on the faces of a hyperplane arrangement , and that the representation theory of the hyperplane face monoid could be used to analyze these markov chains .",
    "this observation created substantial interest in random walks on hyperplane face monoids and related semigroups  @xcite and the theory of left regular band walks more generally @xcite , and in various aspects of the representation theory of hyperplane face monoids @xcite , general finite left regular bands @xcite and @xmath0-trivial monoids  @xcite , as well as the study of several related ( quasi)varieties of semigroups and monoids  @xcite .",
    "the representation theory of hyperplane face monoids is also closely connected to the solomon descent algebra ( see @xcite for further details ) and hyperplane face monoids themselves also arise in connection with combinatorial hopf algebras @xcite .",
    "the study of the tropical complex generated by the columns of a real @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 ( see section [ sect : tropfaces ] ) was initiated by develin and sturmfels @xcite .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that such a tropical complex can be viewed as the analogue of the abstract simplicial complex of faces resulting from a real hyperplane arrangement , by associating to each column of @xmath2 a min - plus linear form specifying a min - plus hyperplane ( this will be explained in detail in section 3 ) .    in the case of real hyperplane arrangements ,",
    "the corresponding face poset is a monoid with a natural geometrically ( or combinatorially ) defined product .",
    "there is no obvious analogous monoid structure on the face poset of a tropical hyperplane arrangement , but we shall show instead that the hyperplane face monoid @xmath3 of the classical _ braid arrangement _ ( see section [ sect : braid ] ) acts upon the set of faces determined by @xmath4 min - plus tropical hyperplanes in @xmath5 .",

    "we give a purely combinatorial characterization of the types of @xmath6 , and use this to give a combinatorial argument showing that @xmath3 acts on the set of all types . to this end",

    "it is then clear that the map @xmath51 defined by @xmath52 is constant on faces and that distinct faces have distinct images under @xmath53 .",

    "the chambers are those elements of the image in which each component is non - zero , and the face @xmath56 corresponding to the common intersection of all hyperplanes in @xmath57 is identified with the all - zero sequence .",
    "it is well known ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) that the set of all faces @xmath54 of any finite linear hyperplane arrangement can be endowed with the structure of a monoid , whose identity element is @xmath56 , and whose product can be defined geometrically as follows . for faces @xmath58 and @xmath59 of a given hyperplane arrangement , choose points @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "the min - plus semiring is defined similarly , and negation provides an isomorphism between these two structures , allowing one to easily interpret min - plus results in the max - plus setting and vice versa . the word _",
    "tropical _ is used throughout the literature to describe a number of algebraic and geometric constructions involving either the max - plus or min - plus semiring .",
    "for example , it is clear that these operations extend naturally to give notions of addition and scalar multiplication of vectors , hence giving @xmath5 the structure of a ( semi)module over the max - plus or min - plus semiring .",

    "( t3 ) suppose that @xmath53 and @xmath87 are partial bijections contained in @xmath167 with the same domain @xmath32 $ ] and image @xmath33 $ ] . by our previous remarks",
    ", it suffices to show that if @xmath53 is contained in @xmath446 then @xmath87 is contained in @xmath451 too .",
    "assume by relabelling if necessary that @xmath452 $ ] , and that @xmath453 for all @xmath454 $ ] , with @xmath87 a non - identity permutation of @xmath270 $ ] . since @xmath53 ( the identity map on @xmath270 $ ] ) and @xmath87 are both contained in @xmath167 , by definition we know that : @xmath455 for each @xmath456 $ ] we define @xmath457 so that by we have @xmath458 .",
    "since @xmath53 ( the identity ) is contained in @xmath446 it follows that @xmath459.\\ ] ]    now fix @xmath18 and look at the orbit , @xmath460 say , of @xmath18 under @xmath87 . by applying and to each of the elements @xmath461 $ ] in turn , we obtain : @xmath462 note that if @xmath463 then by definition we see that @xmath464 .",
    "since @xmath465 is contained in this intersection , we must have @xmath466 .",
    "continuing in this way we note that @xmath467 from which we conclude that these indices all coincide and hence by combining the information above we see that the set @xmath468 contains the entire orbit of @xmath18 under @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , @xmath469 for all @xmath470 , hence showing that @xmath87 is contained in @xmath446 as required .    since @xmath471 for all @xmath331 it follows that if a type @xmath167 is equal to @xmath472 for some other type @xmath473 , then @xmath473 must be a face of @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that each maximal dimensional cell contained in @xmath6 is a fixed point of the right action of @xmath3 . thus ( just as in the case of usual hyperplane arrangements ) , this right action can not be used to generate a random walk on the maximal dimensional cells ( `` chambers '' ) of the tropical hyperplane arrangement .",
    "we also note that although @xmath3 acts upon @xmath6 , this action does not immediately restrict to give an action on the max - plus polytope generated by the columns of @xmath2 ( that is , the collection of bounded cells ) .",
    "for example , acting upon the face @xmath153 of the tropical hyperplane arrangement given in example 3.1 by the element @xmath474 gives the unbounded face @xmath172 , which is not contained in the max - plus column space of @xmath2 .",
