    "the relevance of bessel functions to the solution of a great variety of problems in physics and engineering is widely known and does not need to be stressed . in particular , zeros of the different kinds of those functions are closely related to energies of bound or resonant physical systems .",
    "for instance , the @xmath2-zeros of the hankel function @xmath5 for positive values of @xmath0 determine the poles of the amplitude of scattering of various kinds of waves by spheres and cylinders @xcite .",
    "almost four decades ago we considered @xcite the zeros of the modified bessel function of the third kind , @xmath1 , also known as modified hankel function or macdonald function .",
    "information about the @xmath0-zeros of @xmath1 for positive order @xmath2 was found in the book by watson @xcite . however , our interest , motivated by a quantum mechanical problem , was on @xmath0-zeros when @xmath2 assumes purely imaginary values .",
    "for that case it was already known @xcite that @xmath1 presents an infinity of zeros , all of them located on the positive real semiaxis of the complex @xmath0-plane .",
    "we showed that these positive zeros , labelled according to decreasing values , form a sequence tending to be a geometric progression with ratio @xmath6 .",
    "we gave , also , asymptotic approximations to the position of the largest zeros for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "further discussions of the properties of the zeros of @xmath1 , @xmath2 pure imaginary , have been carried out by laforgia @xcite and by dunster @xcite .",
    "zeros of @xmath1 with complex @xmath2 have been less studied . in view of their application in the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic inhomogeneous conducting media ,",
    "nalesso @xcite has considered the @xmath2-zeros of @xmath7 for fixed positive values of @xmath8 .",
    "but , to our knowledge , a discussion of the @xmath0-zeros of @xmath1 for arbitrary complex @xmath2 is still lacking .    in recent years , stimulated by review papers by lozier and olver @xcite and by the dlmf project , a considerable number of new algorithms for the computation of special functions have been published . concerning the macdonald function , refs .",
    "@xcite are to be noticed . as a general rule ,",
    "algorithms lose accuracy in the vicinity of the zeros .",
    "hence the interest of having a knowledge , at least approximate , of the location of those zeros . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath1 presents only a finite number of @xmath0-zeros in the riemann sheet @xmath9 if @xmath2 is real , whereas an infinity of zeros occur if @xmath2 is pure imaginary .",
    "it has therefore seemed to us interesting to study the evolution of the @xmath0-zeros of @xmath1 as the modulus and/or argument of @xmath2 are continuously changed .    in what follows",
    ", we consider only values of @xmath2 in the quadrant @xmath10 and @xmath0 is assumed to lie in the principal riemann sheet , @xmath9 , for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetry relations @xmath11 allow to extend our results to values of @xmath2 in all quadrants . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "9.6.4 ) @xmath12 valid when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are analytically continued to every riemann sheet , proves that the pattern of @xmath0-zeros of the hankel function @xmath15 results from that of @xmath1 by rotation by an angle of @xmath16 around the origin .",
    "we discuss in section 2 the behaviour of the zeros for decreasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "the case of large values of @xmath3 is considered in section 3 , where asymptotic approximations to the zeros are given .",
    "numerical results for the zeros of @xmath1 with moderate @xmath3 are presented graphically in section 4 .",
    "finally , the particular case of real @xmath2 is commented in section 5 .",
    "the particular case of pure imaginary @xmath2 revealed @xcite that , as @xmath3 goes to zero , all zeros of @xmath1 approach the origin .",
    "therefore we start by assuming @xmath18 in the expression of @xmath1 as a sum of two convergent ascending series ( * ? ? ?",
    "9.6.2 and 9.6.10 ) @xmath19 valid for @xmath2 different from an integer .",
    "obviously , the zeros of @xmath1 should satisfy the relation @xmath20 that , in the case of being @xmath18 , can be approximated by @xmath21 where @xmath22 could in principle take the values @xmath23 , although , according to that obtained in the case of @xmath2 being pure imaginary , actually existing zeros correspond to @xmath24 these values of @xmath22 will be used as a label to characterize each zero in the form @xmath25 .",
    "ignoring , in the crudest approximation , the last term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ seis ] ) , one has @xmath26 the behavior of the zeros @xmath25 as @xmath3 decreases can be immediately obtained from these expressions by using the series expansion ( * ? ? ?",

    ", it turns out @xmath32 these two equations allow us to obtain a picture of the behaviour of the zeros of @xmath1 as @xmath3 tends to zero .",
    "for instance , let us assume that @xmath3 decreases with @xmath4 fixed . if @xmath33 , the zeros @xmath25 approach the origin along the positive real semiaxis , as described in ref .",
    "if @xmath34 , @xmath35 tends to zero whereas @xmath36 decreases without limit . in other words , the zeros approach the origin spiraling clockwise infinitely . according to eq .",
    "( [ ddos ] ) , most of zeros ( or even all of them , for sufficiently small @xmath3 ) occur outside the principal riemann sheet . for @xmath37 , eqs .",
    "( [ duno ] ) and ( [ ddos ] ) are no more valid because , as we will see later , the possibility exists of @xmath25 going to infinity for certain values of @xmath2 .",
    "the behaviour of the zeros in this case is much more complicated and will be described in section 5 .",
    "we have already mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) allows one to obtain the zeros of the macdonald function from those of the hankel function , and viceversa .",
    "previous research , by other authors @xcite , on the @xmath2-zeros of the hankel function shows that , for large values of @xmath39 , they occur at @xmath40 .",
    "asymptotic expansions of @xmath14 valid in the transition region should then be used to obtain approximate expressions of its @xmath0-zeros for @xmath38 . from eqs .",
    "9.3.23 and 9.3.24 of ref .",
    "@xcite , by using eqs .",

    "9.3.25 and 9.3.26 of the same reference . a more powerful asymptotic expansion of @xmath14 exists ( * ?",
    "9.3.37 ) , but its coefficients are much more complicated and , although reversion of that expansion could be done by means of a procedure due to fabijonas and olver @xcite , we find preferable , for the sake of simplicity and transparency , to work with eq .",
    "( [ dtres ] ) .",
    "a simple inspection of that expansion shows that , for large @xmath3 , it vanishes for values of @xmath45 verifying @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents each one of the zeros of the airy function , given in table 10.13 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath48 is to be determined . trying an expansion of the form @xmath49 and using taylor expansions of the airy function and of its derivative around @xmath47 , it is straightforward , with the aid of a computer algebra software package , to check that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dtres ] ) cancels out for @xmath50 approximate values of the @xmath0-zeros of @xmath15 are then given by @xmath51 reversion of this relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 would provide an approximation for the @xmath2-zeros of @xmath15 when @xmath39 is large , @xmath52 to be compared with those given in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) , the @xmath0-zeros of @xmath53 are given approximately by @xmath54    the usefulness of eqs .",
    "( [ dsiete ] ) and ( [ docho ] ) is restricted to the first values of @xmath55 , due to the fact that @xmath56 increases with @xmath57 .",
    "this makes the the omitted terms in the expansion ( [ dsiete ] ) to increase and invalidates their suppression .",
    "besides this , @xmath58 , given by ( [ dcuatro ] ) , increases with @xmath57 and , for a given @xmath2 , may reach a value such that expansion ( [ dtres ] ) ceases from being useful .",
    "if zeros corresponding to a large @xmath57 are to be considered , approximate values can be obtained following a procedure , already used by magnus and kotin @xcite and by cochran @xcite , consisting in taking logarithms in eq .",
    "( [ cuatro ] ) , @xmath59 and approximating the logarithms of the gamma functions by their asymptotic expansions ( * ? ? ? * eq .",

    "moreover , for a given value of @xmath3 , the approximation ( [ vuno ] ) looses accuracy as @xmath4 goes from @xmath63 towards @xmath64 and becomes completely useless for real @xmath2 . a numerical comparison of the values obtained with eqs .",
    "( [ docho ] ) and ( [ vuno ] ) for moderate values of @xmath57 and @xmath22 shows that both labels coincide .",
    "we have used a numerical procedure to explore the behaviour of the @xmath0-zeros of @xmath1 , as a function of @xmath2 , for moderate values of @xmath3 . in order to simplify the presentation of the results ,",
    "two different situations have been considered : ( i ) variable @xmath3 with fixed @xmath4 , and ( ii ) variable @xmath65 keeping @xmath3 fixed .",
    "the resulting trajectories of the first , second , and third zeros are represented in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . for",
    "the evaluation of @xmath1 , expression ( [ tres ] ) has been used .",
    "more sophisticated algorithms can be found in the literature @xcite , but either they have been conceived only for particular ( real or pure imaginary ) values of the variable or the order , or they become unnecessarily complicated for our purpose of giving a merely qualitative description of the zeros . for the location of these , the newton method has been used .",
    "let us mention , however , other existing techniques like , for instance , the auxiliary tables for the evaluation of the @xmath2-zeros of @xmath1 , for @xmath0 real or pure imaginary , proposed by cochran and hoffspiegel @xcite , the finite element approximation method , applied by leung and ghaderpanah @xcite to a very precise determination of the zeros of @xmath66 , and a procedure , applied by segura @xcite to the computation of zeros of bessel and other special functions , that uses fixed point iterations and does not require the evaluation of the functions .    a double precision fortran code was used to compute the expression @xmath67 whose zeros coincide with those of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tres ] ) .",
    "the two series were summed term by term until the absolute value of the ratio of the last term to the partial sum turned out to be less than @xmath68 .",
    "a warning message was foreseen for the case of the number of summed terms becoming larger than @xmath69 , but this limit was never reached .",
    "fortunately , zeros at large values of @xmath39 occur for values of @xmath2 either of large modulus or in the neighbourhood of @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "in the first case , the series in ( [ extra ] ) converge reasonably , from the numerical point of view ; in the second case , analytical methods can be used to approximate the zeros .",
    "typical runs of our procedure can be seen in table 1 , which shows intermediate results in the determination of the first , second and third zeros of @xmath1 , with @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "initial approximate values of the zeros , for a given @xmath2 , were obtained by extrapolation of the trajectories followed by the zeros as @xmath2 varies . besides the smallness of the values of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath74 , their changes of sign in the successive steps of the newton method make us to be confident about our results .",

    "of course , the locations of these zeros are the same in all sheets .    the aproximate expression ( [ docho ] ) for the first zeros of @xmath1 ( @xmath86 ) is valid also in this case . equation ( [ vuno ] ) , instead , is not applicable because the assumption @xmath87 , used in its derivation , is not justified . also , eqs .",
