    "in this paper , we use first principles calculations to study the physical and electronic properties of hypothetical polar oxysulfide perovskite solid solutions of the chemical formula pbtio@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "we seek to identify new photovoltaic materials for efficient solar energy conversion .",
    "photovoltaic materials must have band gaps in the range 1.1 - 2 ev to provide strong light absorption and energy conversion .",
    "the best single - junction materials , such as silicon , cdte , and copper indium selenide , exhibit gaps near the shockley and queisser ( sq ) detailed balance model optimal value of 1.3  ev . photons with energies less than the band gap will not promote electrons to the conduction band , while electrons absorbing photons with energies greater than the conduction band minimum will lose energy as the electrons decay to the band edge . to surpass the single - material sq limit , photovoltaics with a range of band gaps",
    "are arranged in multi - junction solar cells , @xmath8 @xmath9 cuin@xmath2ga@xmath10se@xmath11 and ingap / gaas / ingaasn / ge.@xcite in addition to a good match between the band gap and the solar spectrum , excited carrier recombination must be prevented in order to obtain the photocurrent .",
    "this is typically done by an electric field generated at a @xmath12 junction that moves the holes and the excited electrons in opposite directions .",
    "another recently studied method has been to use ferroelectric materials , for which the strong inversion symmetry breaking and spontaneous polarization give rise to the separation of charge carriers in the bulk of the material ( bulk photovoltaic effect ) .",
    "the known perovskite bifeo@xmath0@xcite and new materials including [ knbo@xmath0]@xmath14[bani@xmath15nb@xmath15o@xmath16@xmath17,@xcite kbife@xmath7o@xmath18,@xcite and bi@xmath19ti@xmath0o@xmath20-lacoo@xmath0@xcite are examples of polar oxide materials with band gaps in the visible range in which the bulk photovoltaic effect has been observed .",
    "we choose the classic pbtio@xmath0 ( pto ) ferroelectric perovskite oxide as a basis for alloying with sulfur on the oxygen sites .",
    "pto is highly polar ( @xmath21 = 0.88 c / m@xmath22 ) and has an indirect band gap of 3.45 - 3.6 ev.@xcite excitation across the gap is essentially a charge transfer from the o 2@xmath23 orbitals to the ti 3@xmath24 orbitals .",
    "therefore , substitution of the more electronegative oxygen by the less electronegative sulfur should lead to a lower band gap , while possibly preserving the ferroelectricity .",
    "the substitution of oxygen by sulfur or vice versa in order to tailor band gaps is well documented in other materials.@xcite unlike replacement of oxygen with nitrogen or titanium with nickel to lower band gaps,@xcite the substitution of isovalent sulfur in place of oxygen does not require vacancies to preserve charge neutrality .",
    "while simple corner - sharing oxysulfide perovskites have yet to be reported in the literature , closely related and more complicated oxysulfides do exist .",
    "they have been reported as either ruddlesden - popper phases@xcite or as layered materials with perovskite - like oxide layers alternating with either antifluorite or rock salt sulfide layers.@xcite thus the current work is novel in that it explores the feasibility of synthesizing a purely corner - sharing perovskite phase .",
    "all density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in this study are performed using the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the dft packages we use in this study are abinit@xcite and quantum espresso.@xcite the atoms are represented by norm - conserving optimized pseudopotentials @xcite generated using opium , @xcite and all , except oxygen , are further refined using the designed non - local methodology .",
    "@xcite we pseudize the following orbitals : @xmath25 and @xmath26 for o ; @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for s ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for pb ; and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for ti .",
    "the pseudopotentials are optimized for a 50 ry plane - wave cutoff , and all solid - state calculations use this value .",
    "abinit is used for relaxation calculations , in order to determine unit cell parameters , atomic positions , and relative energies . for the standard perovskite unit cell of five atoms , a monkhorst - pack ( mp )",
    "k - point grid@xcite of 8@xmath358@xmath358 is used ( though results using a 4@xmath354@xmath354 grid are quite similar to those using an 8@xmath358@xmath358 grid ) . for calculations requiring a doubling of the unit cell in a cartesian direction , the mp grid is set to 4 for that dimension .    in order to determine the preferred location of s atoms for pbtio@xmath1s@xmath2 with @xmath3 = 1 and @xmath3 = 2",
    ", we perform two sets of calculations . in the first set",
    ", a five - atom unit cell is used .",
    "we evaluate all the possible locations of a minority species anion in a tetragonal perovskite cell .",
    "we also consider the paraelectric , cubic perovskite and displace the anions above and below an imaginary center plane that intersects four of the six anions of the octahedron .",
    "for initial cell parameters , we use two strain states as well : a compressed case and an expanded case . for the compressed case , the cell parameters are @xmath6 = 3.87  and @xmath36 = 4.07  for the tetragonal cells and @xmath6 = 4.09  for the cubic cells .",
    "( as will be shown later , the cell parameters used for the tetragonal / compressed case were calculated from a five - atom pto relaxation . )",
    "the @xmath6 lattice parameter in the cubic case is determined by setting the pb - o - pb face diagonal length equal to twice the sum of the ionic radii of a 12-coordinated pb@xmath37 ( 1.49  ) and a six - coordinated o@xmath38 ( 1.40  ) .",
    "@xcite for the expanded cells , cell parameters are increased by a factor of 1.31 , which represents the radius ratio of six - coordinated s@xmath38 ( 1.84  ) to six - coordinated o@xmath38.@xcite    for the second set of calculations , we consider ten - atom unit cells consisting of two pto unit cells with either the @xmath6 or the @xmath36 lattice parameter doubled .",
    "ten - atom unit cells also accommodate @xmath3 = 0.5 concentrations .",
    "we evaluate all of the cases in which a s atom may occupy any of the six o positions for the @xmath3 = 0.5 system , and all of the ways that two minority species anions may occupy the six anion locations for the @xmath3 = 1 and @xmath3 = 2 systems .",
    "the systems @xmath3 = 0 and",
    "@xmath3 = 3 , with only one anion species , have only one configuration and were relaxed from five - atom cubic unit cells with an initial starting @xmath6 lattice parameter derived from ionic radii sums .    in order to extend our analysis to lower concentrations of s , we create unit cells by inserting one , two and three pto layers into the relaxed @xmath3 = 0.5 structure while keeping the s atom confined to the ( 001 ) .",
    "these compositions have @xmath3 = 0.33 , 0.25 , and 0.2 respectively .",
    "all systems are considered to be fully relaxed when successive self - consistent iterations yield total energy differences less than 10@xmath39 ha / cell and atomic forces less than 10@xmath40 ha / bohr .",
    "the findsym package@xcite is used to determine the space groups of the relaxed structures . in order to assess whether or not any of the systems prefer a glazer tilt system structure,@xcite a set of relaxation calculations",
    "is performed on 40-atom 2@xmath352@xmath352 unit cells for the @xmath3 = 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 3 compositions .",
    "the starting locations of the s atoms for @xmath3 = 0.5 , 1 , and 2 are determined from the earlier five- and ten - atom relaxations .",
    "polarization calculations are carried out using abinit , while band gap and projected density of states ( pdos ) calculations are performed using quantum espresso with 12@xmath3512@xmath3512 k - point grids .",
    "post - dft band gap investigation is carried out using the pbe0@xcite method as implemented in quantum espresso , and the @xmath4@xcite method as implemented in abinit.@xcite the nature of the bonding in @xmath3 = 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 2 systems is assessed using a bader charge analysis package.@xcite",
    "our calculated results for the end member , pbtio@xmath5 , are in agreement with earlier published theoretical work.@xcite the relaxed lattice parameters are @xmath6 = 3.87 and @xmath36 = 4.07  , yielding a @xmath41 ratio of 1.05 .",
    "we find an indirect ( x-@xmath42 ) band gap of 1.47 ev and polarization ( strictly in the @xmath43 direction ) of 0.85 c / m@xmath44 .",
    "these results , as well as all the physical and electronic properties for pbtio@xmath1s@xmath2 @xmath3 = 0 and @xmath3 = 3 and high symmetry pbtio@xmath1s@xmath2 @xmath3 = 0.2 - 2 are listed in tables [ elecres ] and [ elecres2 ] . since the lda calculated band gap underestimates the experimental band gap , post - dft methods must be applied . for pto",
    ", we calculate a band gap of 3.44 ev using the pbe0 method , ( with the @xmath45 parameter set to 0.25 ) , and a gap of 4.10 ev by the @xmath4 method . to our knowledge",
    ", only one other theoretical study@xcite has applied the @xmath4 method to calculate the band gap in pto and the calculations are consistent .",
    "since the @xmath4 result overestimates the experimental pto band gap , we investigate whether the semi - core states incur greater exchange - correlation errors by calculating the @xmath4 gap without the semi - core states of pb and ti in the valence space .",
    "however , this leads to only a 0.2 ev reduction in the pto band gap .",
    "we therefore surmise that the pbe0 method is probably a slightly better predictor of the band gap for the oxysulfide systems .",
    "we do not use the lda+@xmath46 method , as an earlier paper reports a band gap of only 2.17 ev with this technique.@xcite    within the cubic corner - sharing motif , pbtis@xmath5 is found to be a @xmath6@xmath47@xmath48@xmath49@xmath48@xmath49 tilt system with @xmath6 12@xmath50 and @xmath48 15@xmath50 , as determined from the 40-atom 2@xmath352@xmath352 relaxation .",
    "a further relaxation , this time on a standard 20-atom unit cell arranged in the @xmath51 structure , yields the same structure as the 40-atom relaxation .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ground state for pbtis@xmath5 arranged in the corner - sharing perovskite mode is @xmath51 . while the lda electronic structure calculations predict that it is metallic and nonpolar , the pbe0 calculated gap is 0.86 ev . with the minimum representation for the @xmath51 tilt system being a 20-atom unit cell , the @xmath4 method",
    "is not applied here as it is computationally expensive .",
    "@xcite also , if we restrict the five atom unit cell to the @xmath52 space group , which is higher in relative energy to the @xmath51 phase , even though an lda band gap calculation again shows the compound to be metallic , a gap of 1.60 ev is obtained by the pbe0 method and a 1.19 ev gap by the @xmath4 method . with a band gap in the visible range and associated polarization stemming from its non - centrosymmetric nature ,",
    "pbtis@xmath5 arranged in the @xmath52 space group has the properties required for a bulk photovoltaic effect material .",
    "this contrasts with the low energy @xmath51 formation , which is centrosymmetric and thus not suitable for bulk photovoltaic effect purposes .",
    "however , tempering these results is the fact that pbtis@xmath5 has not been made , and the only synthesized stoichiometries known for the pb - ti - s system are misfit layered compounds with chemical formula ( pbs)@xmath53(tis@xmath11 ) and ( pbs)@xmath53(tis@xmath11)@xmath54.@xcite in these compounds , distorted rock salt - like pbs layers are intercalated with tis@xmath11 edge - sharing sheets .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that for the perovskite structure evaluated in ten - atom unit cells , the lowest energy state of pbtio@xmath1s@xmath2 @xmath3 = 0.5 , 1 , and 2 is tetragonal with the minority species atoms located on apical sites of the octahedra .",
    "the resulting structures for @xmath3 = 0.5 and 1 , as well as for @xmath3 = 0.2 , 0.25 , and 0.33 , are tetragonal with @xmath6 lattice parameters within 2.5% of the parent , pbtio@xmath5 .",
    "our results also show that the use of cs@xmath11(@xmath55 ) and h@xmath11s(@xmath55 ) to replace o with s in pto is a viable method to synthesize the compounds with @xmath3 = 0.2 - 0.5 . with respect to electronic properties , the polarization values of the @xmath3 = 0.2 - 1 materials are greater than that of the parent pto and increase with increasing s concentration .",
    "the band gaps of the @xmath3 = 0.2 - 2.0 systems were evaluated by the post - dft method of pbe0 , and , for @xmath3 = 0.5 , 1 and 2 , by the @xmath4 method as well , and found to be in the visible range .",
    "thus , pbtio@xmath1s@xmath2 @xmath3 = 0.2 - 2 are predicted to have significant polarization and low band gaps , and should be considered solar bulk photovoltaic material candidates .",
