    "one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology is to probe einstein s general relativity ( gr ) at any scale beyond the classical tests that confirmed such a theory in the weak field limit and at solar system level .",
    "gr is assumed as the standard theory of gravity describing astrophysical structures up to the whole observed universe ; however there are some inconsistencies at ultraviolet scales ( e.g. the initial singularity , the quantum gravity issue ) and infrared scales ( e.g. cosmic acceleration , concordance problem , flatness problem , galaxy rotation curves , large scale structure , massive stars formation ) that strongly suggest that einstein s approach should be revised or at least extended .",
    "furthermore , astrophysical observations of the last decades suggest that new ( dark ) ingredients are necessary to achieve a self - consistent cosmological model .",
    "in particular , the observations suggest the hubble flow is currently accelerating , and the simplest way to explain the cosmic acceleration is to insert a cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) in the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology @xcite , representing about @xmath6 of the total amount of energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the galaxy rotation curves and the large scale structure could be dynamically addressed by introducing huge amounts of dark matter ( about the 25@xmath7 of the total matter ) .",
    "only 5@xmath7 of the cosmic budget is constituted by standard matter as stars , neutrinos , radiation , heavy elements and free cosmological hydrogen ad helium .",
    "alternative approaches to gr could be pursued with the aim to explain the observed acceleration and missing matter without introducing new ingredients up to now not observed at fundamental scales .",
    "the so - called @xmath0-gravity is considered as a possible , straightforward mechanism to explain the cosmic acceleration without inserting unknown elements as dark energy and dark matter , but extending the geometric part of the field equations by relaxing the strict hypothesis that the gravitational action has to be restricted to @xmath4 as in the hilbert - einstein one @xcite .",
    "these theories have been investigated both at cosmological scales and in the weak field limit @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a late accelerating behavior can be easily recovered @xcite and it can be related to an early inflationary expansion @xcite . furthermore , modifying the gravity action by assuming non - linear lagrangians , one obtain corrections to the gravitational potential which can be useful for astrophysical phenomenology at galactic scales .",
    "in particular , without the introduction of dark matter , the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the haloes of galactic clusters can be dynamically addressed @xcite .",
    "several of these extended models reproduce solar system tests so they are not in conflict with gr experimental results but simply extend them @xcite .",

    "finally , it is worth noticing that the newtonian value is an upper limit for the jean mass coinciding with @xmath4 .",
