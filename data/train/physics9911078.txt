    "apart from their technological importance , emulsions have served as model systems accessible to rigorous theoretical modeling .",
    "the study of emulsions consisting of droplets of a liquid dispersed in another liquid has thus contributed substantially to our understanding of the rheology of complex fluids . however , although major theoretical achievements date back to the beginning of the @xmath0 century , further progress turned out to be difficult .",
    "the macroscopic rheological properties of emulsions are determined by the reaction of the individual drops to the flow field , which in turn is modified by the presence of other drops .",
    "the mutual hydrodynamic interactions of drops complicates substantially the mathematical description .",
    "moreover , depending on system parameters and flow type , droplets may break under steady flow conditions if a certain critical strain rate is exceeded .",
    "rigorous calculations of the constitutive equation have therefore concentrated on very dilute emulsions and on conditions where drops are only weakly deformed .",
    "sometimes , however , it is desirable to have an approximate expression , which  though not rigorous  can serve for practical purposes as a quantitative description in the parameter region beyond the ideal limits . as far as the dependence of the viscoelastic properties of an emulsion on the volume fraction @xmath1 of the dispersed phase is concerned , such an approximation has been given by @xcite .",
    "it is not rigorous beyond first order in @xmath1 but serves well some practical purposes even at rather high volume fractions .",
    "it seems not reasonable to look for a comparably simple approximation for the dependence of shear viscosity @xmath2 on shear rate @xmath3 that covers the whole range of parameters , where all kinds of difficult break  up scenarios are known to occur . in the next section ,",
    "we propose instead a less predictive expression which contains an average drop size @xmath4 ( that may change with shear rate ) as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "the latter has to be determined independently either from theory or experiment .",
    "it turns out , however , that for a substantial range of viscosity ratios and shear rates , the expression for @xmath5 is to a large extent independent of morphology . for conditions , where drops do not break outside this region , we point out a similarity relation between this expression and the frequency dependent viscoelastic moduli @xmath6 , @xmath7 , similar to the _",
    "rule in polymer physics .",
    "more precisely , we show that in the limit of small drop deformation , the constitutive equation of an emulsion composed of newtonian constituents of equal density can be obtained from the frequency dependent linear response to leading order in capillary number @xmath8 and ( reciprocal ) viscosity ratio @xmath9 .",
    "and we argue that the identification is likely to represent a good approximation beyond this limit in a larger part of the @xmath10 parameter plane .",
    "experimentally , this similarity relation can be tested directly , without interference of theoretical modeling , by comparing two independent sets of rheological data . in summary ,",
    "our theoretical discussion provokes two major empirical questions .",
    "( 1 ) if drops break : does the expression for the viscosity derived in eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) describe the data with @xmath4 the average drop size at a given shear rate ? ( 2 ) if drops do not break below a certain characteristic capillary number @xmath11 : does the proposed similarity rule hold ? to what extent does it generalize to non ",
    "newtonian constituents ? in section",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we address mainly the second question by experiments with a quasi ",
    "static droplet phase of a mixture of moderately viscoelastic polymer solutions .",
    "a common way to characterize the rheological properties of complex fluids such as emulsions , suspensions , and polymer solutions , is by means of a _ constitutive equation _ or an equation of state that relates the components @xmath12 of the _ stress tensor _ to the _ rate  of  strain tensor _ @xmath13 .",
    "this relation can account for all the internal heterogeneity and the complexity and interactions of the constituents if only the system may be represented as a homogeneous fluid on macroscopic scales .",
    "the form of possible constitutive equations is restricted by general _",
    "symmetry arguments _ , which provide guidelines for the construction of phenomenological expressions @xcite . on the other hand , for special model systems",
    "the constitutive equations may be calculated directly at least for some restricted range of parameters .",
    "an early example for a direct computation of the constitutive equation of a complex fluid is einstein s formula @xmath14 for the shear viscosity @xmath15 of a dilute suspension ( particle volume fraction @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is obtained by solving stokes equation for an infinite homogeneous fluid of viscosity @xmath17 containing a single solid sphere . for a sufficiently dilute suspension",
    ", the contributions of different particles to the overall viscosity @xmath2 can be added independently , giving an effect proportional to @xmath1 . in close analogy",

    "this expression includes einstein s result as the limiting case of a highly viscous droplet , @xmath21 . as in einstein",
    "s calculation , interactions of the drops are neglected .",
    "the result is independent of surface tension @xmath22 , shear rate @xmath3 , and drop radius @xmath4 ; i.e. , it is a mere consequence of the presence of a certain amount @xmath1 of dispersed drops , regardless of drop size and deformation ( as long as the latter is small ) .",
    "moreover , the dynamic ( frequency dependent ) linear response of an emulsion has been calculated by @xcite .",
    "his results are quoted in section  [ sec : cox - merz ] below .    under steady flow conditions ,",
    "drop deformation itself is proportional to the magnitude of the rate  of  strain tensor @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , for simple shear flow with constant shear rate @xmath23 , the characteristic measure of drop deformation for given @xmath24 is the _ capillary number _ @xmath25 also introduced by @xcite .",
    "it appears as dimensionless expansion parameter in a perturbation series of the drop shape under shear .",
    "to derive taylor s eq.([eq : taylor ] ) it is sufficient to represent the drops by their spherical equilibrium shape .",

    "the refined analysis did not affect the off ",
    "diagonal elements of the constitutive equation , i.e.   taylor s eq.([eq : taylor ] ) for the viscosity , but it gave the ( unequal ) normal stresses to order @xmath27 .",
    "another limit , where exact results can be obtained , is the limit of large viscosity ratios @xmath21 @xcite . to clarify the physical significance of the different limits we want to give a brief qualitative description of the behavior of a suspended drop under shear , based on work by @xcite and @xcite .    in a quiescent matrix fluid of viscosity @xmath17 ,",
    "a single weakly deformed drop relaxes exponentially into its spherical equilibrium shape ; i.e. , defining dimensionless deformation by @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the major and minor axis of the elongated drop , one has for a small initial deformation @xmath31 , @xmath32 the characteristic _ relaxation time _",
    "@xcite @xmath33 also characterizes the macroscopic _ stress relaxation _ in an unstrained region of a dilute emulsion . at @xmath34",
    "one observes the characteristic relaxation mode in the frequency dependent moduli .",
    "the relaxation time diverges for @xmath35 since it takes longer for a weak surface tension to drive a viscous drop back to equilibrium . what happens if the matrix is steadily sheared at shear rate @xmath36 ?",
    "for @xmath37 , the flow induced in the drop by the external driving is weak compared to the internal relaxation dynamics and the equilibrium state is only slightly disturbed , i.e. , the drop is only weakly deformed .",
    "similarly , for large viscosity ratio @xmath24 , the elongation of the drop becomes very slow compared to vorticity , and hence again very small in the steady state , even if @xmath38 is not small .",
    "technically , this is due to the asymptotic proportionality to @xmath9 of the shear rate within the drop . in both limits of weak deformation , the time @xmath39 also controls the orientation of the major axis of the drop with respect to the flow according to @xmath40 eq.([eq : d_relax ] ) and eq.([eq : angle ] ) both can be used to determine the surface tension @xmath22 from observations of single drops under a microscope . in passing ,",
    "we note that the classical method based on the result obtained by @xcite for the steady  state deformation , can only be used if @xmath24 is not too large , whereas eq.([eq : d_relax ] ) and eq.([eq : angle ] ) are more general .",
    "the exact calculations mentioned so far became feasible because ( and are applicable if ) deviations of the drop from its spherical equilibrium shape are small . on the other hand , if neither the capillary number ( or @xmath38 ) is small nor the viscosity ratio is large , i.e. , @xmath41 drops can be strongly deformed by the symmetric part of the flow field .",
    "experiments with single drops by @xcite and others have shown that this eventually leads to drop break  up if @xmath24 is smaller than some critical viscosity ratio . no general rigorous result for the viscosity of an emulsion is known in this regime , where arbitrary drop deformations and break  up may occur .",
    "below we will also be interested in such cases , where the conditions required for the rigorous calculations are not fulfilled .      for the following discussion",
    "we introduce some additional notation .",
    "the rate  of  strain tensor @xmath13 and the vorticity tensor @xmath42 are defined as symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient @xmath43 . in particular , for a steady simple shear flow @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the components @xmath46 of the stress tensor in the shear plane ( @xmath47 ) as obtained for finite @xmath24 by @xcite read @xmath48 as usual , the material derivative has been defined by @xmath49 where summation over repeated indices is implied , and the first two terms vanish for steady shear flow . note",
    "that since @xmath50 is diagonal , eq.([eq : schowalter ] ) implies @xmath51 , and hence eq.([eq : taylor ] ) remains valid to first order in @xmath8 as we mentioned already .    ) , ( [ eq : cm_miracle ] ) for the viscosity @xmath2 of an emulsion give rigorous results . in the shaded region",
    "they predict @xmath2 to be practically independent of capillary number .",
    "the frame of the box is meant to comprise the whole @xmath26-@xmath24 parameter plane from zero to infinity ( small reynolds number understood ) .",
    "the curved solid line is a sketch of the break  up curve for steadily sheared isolated newtonian drops according to @xcite .",
    "dashed lines indicate schematically our viscosity measurements ( see section  [ sec : experiment ] ) . ]",
    "can we extrapolate the exact second order result eq.([eq : schowalter ] ) for the stress tensor to arbitrary @xmath8 and @xmath24 by using the constraints provided by general invariance arguments ?",
    "for example , since the shear stress has to change sign if the direction of the shear strain is inverted whereas the normal stresses do not , the shear stress and the normal stresses have to be odd / even functions of @xmath3 , respectively . from this observation",
    "we could have foreseen that eq.([eq : taylor ] ) can not be improved by calculating the next order in @xmath3 , i.e. , by considering droplet deformation to lowest order .",
    "more important are galilean invariance and invariance under transformations to rotating coordinate frames , which give rise to the material derivative introduced above . applying the operator @xmath52 to eq.([eq : schowalter ] )",
    "adds to the right hand side of the equation a term @xmath53 plus a term of order @xmath54 , so that one obtains ( in the shear plane ) @xmath55 as another short  hand notation we have introduced a second characteristic time @xmath56 , which to the present level of accuracy in @xmath1 is given by @xmath57 it sets the time scale for _ strain relaxation _ in an unstressed region and was named _ retardation _",
    "time by @xcite .",
    "@xcite realized that up to the partly unknown terms of order @xmath58 on the right  hand side , eq.([eq : acrivos ] ) belongs to a class of possible viscoelastic equations of state already discussed by @xcite .",
    "hence , setting @xmath59 on the right  hand side of eq.([eq : acrivos ] ) , we can define a ( minimal ) model viscoelastic fluid that behaves identical to the emulsion described by eq.([eq : schowalter ] ) for small shear rates .",
    "in contrast to eq.([eq : acrivos ] ) , the truncated formula for the viscosity @xmath60\\ ] ] thus obtained has a manifestly non  perturbative form .",
    "however , no phenomenological parameters had to be introduced .",
    "note that eq.([eq : miracle ] ) comprises both exactly known limits : @xmath61 for fixed @xmath24 , and @xmath21 for arbitrary @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , @xcite have forgotten a term @xmath62 in their eq.(3.6 ) for @xmath46 in the limit @xmath21 for fixed @xmath26 . if the latter is included ,",
    "eq.([eq : miracle ] ) is also in accord with their @xmath63analysis .",
    "moreover , eq.([eq : miracle ] ) has the proper limiting behavior for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , i.e.  @xmath66 , which is an extreme case of eq.([eq : restriction ] ) .",
    "since we assume equal densities for the two phases , the two  phase fluid actually reduces to a one  phase fluid in this degenerate case , and the viscosity is simply @xmath17 , independent of morphology . for illustration , the rigorous limits of eq.([eq : miracle ] ) in the @xmath10 plane",
    "are depicted graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] . following @xcite , a qualitative break  up curve for single drops under steady shear is also sketched . in summary",
    ", eq.([eq : miracle ] ) is correct for arbitrary @xmath24 if @xmath67 , and for arbitrary @xmath8 if @xmath21 , and for small and large @xmath8 if @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , one can expect that eq.([eq : miracle ] ) works reasonably well within a large parameter range ( small reynolds number understood ) .",
    "this is further supported by the observation that the error made in going from eq.([eq : schowalter ] ) to eq.([eq : miracle ] ) rather concerns the _ shape _ of the droplet than its _ extension _ ( it consists in truncating a perturbation series in shape parametrisation ) .",
    "the final result , though sensitive to the latter , is probably less sensitive to the former .",
    "nevertheless , one would not be surprised to see deviations from eq.([eq : miracle ] ) when drops become extremely elongated .",
    "finally , due to changes in morphology by break  up and coalescence , the avarage drop size @xmath4 may change .",
    "observe , however , that for most viscosity ratios ( @xmath24 not close to unity ) , eq.([eq : miracle ] ) is practically independent of capillary number ( and thus of @xmath4 ) when break  up might be expected according @xcite and others . as an analytic function that is physically known to be bounded from above and from below ( the latter at least by the viscosity of a stratified two  phase fluid depicted in fig .  [ fig : mixing ] ) , @xmath68 has to have vanishing slope in the @xmath69direction for large @xmath8 .",
    "according to eq.([eq : miracle ] ) , @xmath68 is almost independent of @xmath8 for @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the turning point in the dilute limit , determined by @xmath72 . for finite volume fractions @xmath73 from eq.([eq : tau_1_oldroyd ] ) replaces @xmath39 .",
    "hence , for @xmath74 , eq.([eq : miracle ] ) and its extension to higher volume fractions derived below in eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) are practically independent of drop deformation and morphology . for finite volume fractions a rough interpolation for @xmath71 derived from eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) is given by @xmath75 . in a large part of parameter space we thus expect eqs.([eq : miracle ] ) , ( [ eq : cm_miracle ] ) to be applicable to monotonic shear histories with @xmath4 given by the average initial radius of the droplets . for non",
    " monotonic shear histories , there can of course be hysteresis effects in @xmath76 that result from morphological changes for @xmath74 .",
    "these can only be avoided by substituting for @xmath4 the radius corresponding to the actual average drop size at the applied shear rate @xmath36 .     of the continuous phase / the viscosity @xmath2 of the whole emulsion , within / outside the `` free  volume  sphere '' of radius @xmath77 .",
    "]      a general limitation of the equations discussed so far , is the restriction to small volume fractions . above",

    "any direct ( coalescence ) and indirect ( hydrodynamic ) interactions of droplets have been neglected in the derivation .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions can approximately be taken into account by various types of cell models .",
    "recently @xcite proposed a self  consistent method analogous to the clausius  mossotti or lorentz  sphere method of electrostatics .",
    "for the case of a disordered spatial distribution of drops his results reduce to those already obtained by @xcite .",
    "oldroyd artificially divides the volume around a droplet of viscosity @xmath78 into an interior `` free volume '' with a viscosity @xmath17 of the bare continuous phase and an exterior part with the viscosity @xmath2 of the whole emulsion ( see fig .",

    "one should expect eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) to be applicable within a large range of shear rates , viscosities , and volume fractions .",

    "[ fig : mixing ] . since our data favor eq.([eq : cm_taylor ] ) over eq.([eq : choi ] ) , and similar observations have been made by others before ( see section  [ sec : experiment ] ) , we will not pursue this alternative approach further in the present contribution .",
    "( chosen arbitrarily ) .",
    "the dot  dashed and dashed _ straight _ lines pertain to dilute emulsions described by the extrapolation formula eq.([eq : miracle ] ) , which reduces to taylor s formula eq.([eq : taylor ] ) for small capillary numbers .",

    "it is interesting to observe that if morphology is conserved ( drop size @xmath4 independent of shear rate ) for @xmath93 , our eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) for the nonlinear shear viscosity is closely related to the expressions for the frequency dependent complex viscosity @xmath94 of an emulsion of two incompressible newtonian liquids as derived by @xcite , @xmath95 for convenience , we also give the corresponding viscoelastic shear modulus @xmath96 , @xmath97 obviously , the shear  rate dependent viscosity of eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) is obtained from the real part of the complex frequency dependent viscosity @xmath98 by substituting @xmath36 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 in the same way , the first normal stress difference @xmath101 from eq.([eq : schowalter ] ) is obtained to leading order in @xmath1 and @xmath36 from @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 reverting the line of reasoning pursued so far , we can conclude that to leading order in @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 the weak deformation limit of the constitutive equation of emulsions is obtained from the linear viscoelastic spectra @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "further , this identification can possibly be extended ( at least approximately ) into regions of the @xmath10 plane where the critical capillary number for drop breakup is somewhat larger than @xmath71 of eq.([eq : region ] ) . in hindsight , it is not surprising that in the case of weakly deformed drops the frequency dependent viscosity and the steady shear viscosity are related .",
    "note that under steady shear , drops undergo oscillatory deformations at a frequencey @xmath106 if observed from a co  rotating frame turning with vorticity at a frequency @xmath107 .",
    "if we take eq.([eq : first_normal_stress ] ) seriously beyond the rigorously known limit , we obtain an interesting prediction for the first normal stress difference .",
    "in contrast to eq.([eq : fnsd_schowalter ] ) , eq.([eq : first_normal_stress ] ) implies that the first normal stress difference saturates at a finite value @xmath108 ^ 2 $ ] for high shear rates .",
    "thus , although the initial slope of the first normal stress difference with @xmath3 increases with @xmath24 , its limit for large @xmath3 decreases with @xmath24 .",
    "finally , we remark that based on qualitative theoretical arguments , the similarity relation contained in eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) and eq.([eq : first_normal_stress ] ) has recently been proposed also for polymer melts @xcite .",

    "the volume fraction of the dispersed phase is chosen to be @xmath113 . ]",
    "generalization of the above theoretical discussion to the case of non  newtonian constituents is not straightforward . indeed , as @xcite already knew , his linear  response results quoted in eq.([eq : eta_w_oldroyd ] ) and eq.([eq : g_w_oldroyd ] ) are readily generalized to viscoelastic constituents by replacing the viscosities @xmath114 in the expression for @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 ) by complex viscosities @xmath117 @xcite . as a consequence , the decompositions of @xmath115 and @xmath116 in real and imaginary parts",
    "are no longer those of eqs.([eq : eta_w_oldroyd ] ) and ( [ eq : g_w_oldroyd ] ) , and @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 are given by more cumbersome expressions . for the steady  state viscosity , on the other hand , one has to deal with a non  homogeneous viscosity even within homogeneous regions of the emulsion , since the strain rate itself is non  homogeneous and the viscosities are strain rate dependent .",
    "we do not attempt to solve this problem here , nor do we try to account for elasticity in the nonlinear case .",
    "yet , it is an intriguing question , whether the similarity rule eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) can be generalized to the case of non - newtonian constituents if the constituents themselves obey the cox ",
    "merz rule ( what many polymer melts and solutions do ) . if both constituents have similar phase angles @xmath122 the generalized viscosity ratio @xmath123 that enters the expressions for @xmath115 and @xmath116 , transforms approximately to @xmath124 by applying the cox ",
    "merz rule .",
    "therefore , in this particular example , eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) supports the expectation that the generalization may work at least approximately .",
    "if , on the other hand , the phase angles of the constituents behave very differently , the answer is less obvious .",
    "this problem has been investigated experimentally and is further discussed in section  [ sec : experiment ] .    in any case , the generalization can only work if the representation of the emulsion by a simple shear  rate dependent viscosity ratio @xmath125 , with @xmath36 the external shear rate , is justified . in the remainder of this section we construct an argument that allows us to estimate the effective shear  rate dependent viscosity ratio that should replace @xmath24 in eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) .",
    "we take into account the deviation of the strain rate from the externally imposed flow only within the drops , because outside the drops the discrepancy is always small . inside a drop",
    ", the strain rate can be small even for high external shear rates if the viscosity ratio @xmath126 is large .",
    "since we are looking for an effective viscosity @xmath127 for the whole drop to replace the viscosity @xmath128 at small shear rate , we replace the non  newtonian drop of non  homogeneous viscosity by an effective pseudo  newtonian drop of homogeneous but shear  rate dependent viscosity .",
    "a possible ansatz for @xmath129 is obtained by requiring that the total energy dissipated within the drop remains constant upon this substitution .",
    "hence , we have @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 denote the rate  of  strain fields in the real drop and in the corresponding model drop of effective viscosity @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "they both depend on the position within the drop , whereas the average strain rate @xmath133 that enters the right  hand side of eq.([eq : dissipation ] ) does not .",
    "since the strain field @xmath132 within a drop of homogeneous viscosity is unique for a given system in a given flow field , @xmath129 itself can be expressed as a function @xmath134 of the average strain rate . here , we approximate this functional dependence by the strain rate dependence @xmath135 of the viscosity of the dispersed fluid .",
    "further , neglecting drop deformation we calculate @xmath136 from the velocity field within a spherical drop @xcite and obtain @xmath137 a different prefactor ( @xmath138 in place of @xmath139 ) in the expression for the effective strain rate @xmath140 was obtained by @xcite using instead of the average in eq.([eq : avg_strain ] ) the maximum norm of @xmath132 . to obtain the correction to eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) due to eq.([eq : eta_eff ] ) in the case of non  newtonian constituents , the implicit equation for @xmath141 has to be solved for given functions @xmath142 and @xmath135 . for shear thinning constituents , eq.([eq : eta_eff ] ) implies a tendency of eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) to overestimate @xmath143 if @xmath36 and @xmath24 are large . in the actual case of interest , for the constituents that were used in the experiments discussed in section  [ sec : experiment ] , the viscosity ratio @xmath24 ( @xmath128 and @xmath17 taken at the external shear rate @xmath3 ) varies almost by a factor of 10 .",
    "however , the corrections discussed in this section only become important for high shear rates , where the constituents are shear thinning .",
    "in this regime , the viscosity ratio ( viscosities taken at the external shear rate ) only varies between @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and hence the corrections expected from eq.([eq : eta_eff ] ) are at best marginally significant at the level of accuracy of both eq.([eq : eta_eff ] ) and the present measurements .",
    "therefore , a representation of the drops by pseudo  newtonian drops of homogeneous but shear  rate dependent viscosity is most probably not a problem for the measurements presented in the following section .",
    "the question as to a generalization of the similarity rule eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) to non ",
    "newtonian constituents seems well defined .",
    "the experimental investigation deals with a phase separated aqueous solution containing a polysaccharide ( alginate ) and a protein ( caseinate ) . this type of solutions are currently used in the food industry .",
    "the methods for characterizing the individual polymers in solution are in general known , especially when dealing with non  gelling solutions where composition and temperature are the only relevant parameters",
    ". the polymers are water soluble .",
    "when the two biopolymers in solution are mixed , a miscibility region appears in the low concentrations range and phase separation at higher concentrations .",
    "the binodal and the tie lines of the phase diagram can then be established by measuring the composition of each phase at a fixed temperature . in general , the rheological behavior of phase separated systems is difficult to investigate , and a suitable procedure is not fully established . in some cases , two  phase solutions",
    "macroscopically separate by gravity within a short period of time , but in some other cases ( such as ours ) they remain stable for hours or days without appearance of any visible interface .",
    "these `` emulsion type '' solutions have no added surfactant . following approaches developed for immiscible blends",
    ", one may try to characterize the partially separated solution as an effective emulsion if the coarsening is slow enough . in order to establish a comparison between phase separated solutions and emulsions ,",
    "it is necessary to know    * the volume fraction of the phases , * their shear ",
    "rate dependent viscosities ( flow curves ) , * their viscoelastic spectra , * the interfacial tension @xmath22 between the phases , * the average radius of @xmath4 the drops      a difficulty when working with phase separated solutions , as opposed to immiscible polymer melts , arises from the fact that each phase is itself a mixture ( and not a pure liquid ) and therefore the rheology of the phase depends on its particular composition .",
    "if one wishes to minimize the number of parameters , it is important to keep the composition of the phases constant upon changing the volume fractions .",
    "this can be achieved by working along a tie line of the phase diagram . and",
    "this is precisely the procedure that we followed .",
    "the polymers were first dissolved , then a large quantity of the ternary mixture was prepared ( 350 ml ) and was centrifuged .",
    "the two phases were then collected separately .",
    "both pure phases were found to be viscoelastic and to exhibit shear thinning behavior , which is especially pronounced for the alginate rich phase with @xmath147 , while the caseinate rich phase is almost newtonian below @xmath148 s@xmath149 .",
    "the viscosity of the alginate rich phase is higher than that of the caseinate rich phase for shear rates below @xmath150 s@xmath149 and lower for higher shear rates .",
    "we checked that both phases obey the usual cox ",
    "merz rule in the whole range of applied shear rates .    by mixing various amounts of each phase",
    ", the volume fraction of the dispersed phase was varied between @xmath151 and @xmath152 while the composition of each phase was kept constant .",
    "in particular , the temperature was kept constant and equal to the centrifugation temperature in order to avoid redissolution of the constituents . to prepare the emulsion ,",
    "the required quantities of each phase were mixed in a vial and gently shaken .",
    "then the mixture was poured on the plate of the rheometer ( ar 1000 from ta instruments fitted with a cone and plate geometry 6 cm/@xmath153 ) and a constant shear rate was applied . the apparent viscosity for a particular shear rate",
    "was then recorded versus time until it reached a stable value . by shearing at a fixed shear rate",
    ", one may expect to create a steady size distribution of droplets , with a shear rate dependent average size .",
    "after each shear experiment a complete dynamic spectrum was performed . in this way , shear rates ranging between @xmath154 s@xmath149 and @xmath155 s@xmath149 were applied .",
    "the analysis of each spectrum according to @xcite allowed us to derive by curve fitting the average drop radius @xmath4 at the corresponding shear rate .",
    "more technical details about the experimental investigation along with more experimental results will be presented elsewhere . here , we concentrate on the analysis of those aspects of the rheological measurements pertinent to the theoretical discussion in section  [ sec : theory ] .      in this section",
    "we present our experimental observations and address the questions posed at the end of the introduction .",
    "before we present our own data we want to comment briefly on related data recently obtained for polymer melts by @xcite .",
    "these authors measured the shear  rate dependent viscosity of binary polymer melts and compared them to the low volume fraction limit of eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) , i.e.  eq.([eq : miracle ] ) , and to ( a truncated form of ) results of @xcite .",
    "they reported much better agreement with eq.([eq : miracle ] ) than with the truncated series from @xcite .",
    "comparison with the full expressions of @xcite would have made the disagreement even worse ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "the average radius @xmath4 that enters the equation , was determined independently for each shear rate applied .",
    "the constituents where moderately non ",
    "newtonian polymer melts , the viscosity ratio varying between @xmath156 over the range of shear rates applied .",
    "hence , these experiments , are located in the interesting parameter range , where eqs.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) and eq.([eq : miracle ] ) for @xmath157 are expected to be sensitive to drop deformation and break  up .",
    "surprisingly , the results show that they describe the data very well over the whole range of shear rates although one would not necessarily expect average drop deformation to be very small .",
    "unfortunately , drop sizes have not been reported by the authors , so conclusions concerning the location in the @xmath10 parameter plane and the validity of the similarity rule eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) can not be drawn . also the question , whether eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] )",
    "holds for small viscosity ratios @xmath158 , can not be answered .",
    "( opaque squares ) and the real part @xmath159 of the dynamic viscosity @xmath160 ( lines ) of a droplet phase of a mixture of weakly viscoelastic polymer solutions ( alginate / caseinate ) . also shown",
    "is eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) for the viscosity of an emulsion of newtonian constituents evaluated for the actually non ",
    "newtonian viscosities of the constituting phases with the drop size obtained from the spectra ( open triangles ) . due to the scatter in the dynamic viscosity at low frequencies",
    "there is an uncertainty in the average drop size , resulting in corresponding error bars ( multiple points ) for eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) . ]",
    "our own measurements were located in about the same @xmath161range . as we noted in the preceding section ,",
    "only the ratio @xmath146 enters rheological equations and knowledge of either @xmath4 or @xmath22 allows the other quantity to be inferred from rheological measurements .",
    "@xcite determined the interfacial tension of the alginate / caseinate system used in our experiments by observing drop relaxation under a microscope and analyzing the data according to section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "they found @xmath162 n / m . using this",
    ", we obtained an average drop size @xmath163 m from the measured spectra @xmath104 , @xmath164 according to @xcite for the experiments reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : cox - merz ] . by the method based on @xcite",
    ", we could not detect a decrease in drop size with shear rate as expected from the phenomenological phase diagram for single newtonian drops under shear as established by @xcite and others .",
    "thus , the limit of high capillary numbers and moderate viscosity ratios ( the region above the break  up curve ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] has been accessed experimentally .",
    "corresponding locations have been indicated qualitatively in the figure by dashed lines . with the drop size being constant , one can try to test the proposed similarity rule eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) . by identifying the axis for frequency @xmath99 and shear rate @xmath36 , data for the real part @xmath159 of the frequency dependent dynamic viscosity @xmath165",
    "are compared to data for the shear  rate dependent viscosity @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cox - merz ] .",
    "the emulsion containing @xmath152 of the alginate rich phase and @xmath166 of the caseinate rich phase has been prepared at room temperature as described in the preceding section .",
    "steady shear rates ranging between @xmath154 s@xmath149 and @xmath155 s@xmath149 corresponding to capillary numbers @xmath167 have been applied . the shear viscosity ( opaque squares )",
    "is reported in the figure for each of these individual measurements .",
    "the multiple data sets for @xmath118 ( lines ) taken each between two successive steady shear measurements , superimpose fairly well ; i.e.  the spectra appear to be remarkably independent of the preceding steady shear rate .",
    "the good coincidence of @xmath168 and @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cox - merz ] show that the data obey the proposed similarity rule eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) over a large range of shear rates .",
    "the agreement near @xmath169 s@xmath149 is a consequence of the proximity to the trivial limit @xmath64 , @xmath170 .",
    "nevertheless , the data provide strong evidence that eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) is an excellent approximation for a large range of viscosity ratios and capillary numbers .",
    "similar results ( not shown ) have been obtained for other volume fractions .",
    "comparison with eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) represented by the open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : cox - merz ] , on the other hand , is less successful at large shear rates , although it is still not too far off for a theoretical curve without any adjustable parameter .",
    "a discrepancy had to be expected as a consequence of the non  newtonian character of the constituents at large shear rates , which is definitely not taken into account in eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) .",
    "for the plot of eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : cox - merz ] we merely substituted @xmath171 taken at the external shear rate @xmath36 for @xmath24 .",
    "the average drop size @xmath4 was obtained from fitting the viscoelastic moduli .",
    "the scatter in the dynamic viscosity data gives rise to an uncertainty in @xmath4 , which is reflected by the multiple open triangles at low shear rates .",
    "it seems that the similarity rule eq.([eq : modified_cox - merz ] ) is more general than eq.([eq : cm_miracle ] ) , i.e. , it still holds for rather viscoelastic constituents ( that obey the usual cox  merz rule ) , where the latter fails .",
    "this relation certainly deserves further investigation with different materials and methods .",
    "in summary , we have succeeded in establishing an analogy first between a partially phase  separated polymer solution and an emulsion , and further between the viscoelastic spectrum of the system and its nonlinear shear viscosity even in the case of ( moderately ) non  newtonian constituents .",
