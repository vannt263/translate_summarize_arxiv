    "wavefront dislocations ( phase singularities or optical vortices ) were introduced in 1974 in a seminal paper by nye and berry [ 1 ] which gave rise to the field of singular optics [ 2 ] .",
    "a non - singular wave locally looks like a segment of a plane wave with parallel wave fronts , well - defined phase , and current flowing in the direction of wave propagation .",
    "nye and berry demonstrated that , in general , the wavefronts in 3d space contain topological dislocation lines , akin to those in crystal lattices , where the phase becomes singular and currents coil around the lines forming _ optical vortices_. the dislocations are characterized by a quantized vortex strength , also called topological charge .",
    "one can distinguish _ screw _ and _ edge _ wavefront dislocations where the vortex lines are , respectively , _",
    "parallel _ and _ orthogonal _ to the wave propagation direction .",
    "in general , mixed _ edge - screw _ dislocations , with the vortex core _ tilted _ with respect to the phase fronts , are possible .",
    "importantly , only screw dislocations are generic in _",
    "monochromatic _ wave fields , while generic edge - screw dislocations require additional _ temporal _ variations [ 1,2 ] .    in 1992",
    "allen _ et al .",
    "_ revealed a close relation between optical vortices and wave _ orbital angular momentum _ ( oam ) [ 3 ] .",
    "they showed that axially - symmetric higher - order optical beams in free space bear screw dislocations along their axes and possess intrinsic oam directed along the beam axis .",
    "this oam is quantized with its magnitude ( in units of @xmath0 per one photon ) being equal to the vortex charge .",
    "thus , monochromatic _ vortex beams _ represent the oam states of light , and nowadays they play an important role in classical and quantum optics [ 4 ] . remarkably , the above phase - dislocation- , vortex- , and oam- properties are generic for all types of linear waves , both classical and quantum , independently of their nature .",
    "in particular , vortex beams with oam were recently described and generated in electron microscopes [ 5,6 ] , as well as employed in acoustics [ 7 ] .    for monochromatic vortex wave beams ,",
    "the intrinsic oam is _ collinear _ to the momentum , with its projection on the beam axis ( helicity ) being quantized . in other words",
    ", such oam behaves very similar to the _ spin _ of a massless particle ( even for nonrelativistic electrons [ 5 ] ) .",
    "then , a natural question arises : `` _ _ can a generic wave packet or beam carry a well - defined intrinsic oam in an arbitrary direction , i.e. , tilted with respect to the propagation direction ? _ _ '' .",
    "it would seem that the direction of the intrinsic oam is associated with the direction of the vortex line , and the tilted oam should appear in states with tilted vortices , i.e. , mixed _ edge - screw _ wavefront dislocations . as we pointed out , such dislocations are generic for _ polychromatic _ fields and our question essentially requires studying vortex beams and oam in _ space - time _ [ 8,9 ] .    in this paper , we address the above question and extend the concepts of intrinsic oam and vortex beams to polychromatic states in space - time .",
    "we analyze the scalar klein - gordon wave equation , so that its relativistic and nonrelativistic limits describe both massless optical fields and massive schrdinger particles , assuming that the polarization effects can be neglected .",
    "we show that the existence of spatio - temporal vortex beams with tilted oam follows from the requirement of relativistic invariance and can be obtained via lorentz transformations of the usual spatial vortex beams [ 9 ] .",
    "hence , the spatio - temporal oam wave states can naturally appear from moving sources emitting stationary ( monochromatic ) vortex states in their rest frames .",
    "as such , our results have implications in optics of moving media [ 10 ] , quantum communications with satellites [ 11 ] , collisions of high - energy particles with oam [ 12 ] , and astrophysical applications of oam of light [ 13,14 ] .",
    "we start with the klein - gordon wave equation in units @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scalar wave function .",
    "the plane - wave solutions of this equation are : @xmath4 & \\equiv & \\exp \\left ( { ik^\\mu   r_\\mu   } \\right)~,\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega^2 - k^2 \\equiv k^\\mu   k_\\mu & = & m^2~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the standard four - vectors in the minkowski space - time with signature @xmath7 .",
    "the second equality in eq . ( 2 ) is the dispersion relation which determines the _ mass hyperboloid _ ( or the light cone at @xmath8 )  a hypersurface in momentum @xmath9-space , where we only consider the positive - energy domain @xmath10 .",
    "we deal with the klein - gordon equation because it possesses relativistic space - time symmetry and is able to describe both quantum massive particles of different energies and classical waves .",
    "( indeed , for @xmath11 it can be reduced to the schrdinger equation , whereas in the relativistic limit @xmath12 it becomes the usual wave equation ) . alongside the wave function @xmath3",
    ", we will use its plane - wave ( fourier ) spectrum @xmath13 , defined with the explicit delta - function of the dispersion ( 2 ) : @xmath14 the simplest monochromatic solutions of wave equations , which carry oam , are _ bessel beams _ [ 15 ] .",
    "these represent eigenmodes of the @xmath15-components of the momentum , @xmath16 , and oam , @xmath17 , and can be constructed as a superposition of multiple plane waves ( 2 ) with fixed @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "it is important to also describe the expectation values of energy - momentum and coordinates of the beam [ 9,16 ] .",
    "the normalized ( per one particle ) expectation values of the energy , transverse coordinates , momentum , and oam for the bessel beam are : @xmath51 hereafter @xmath52 denotes the unit basis vector of the corresponding @xmath53-axis , whereas the subscript `` @xmath54 '' indicates the transverse @xmath55-components of a vector . as expected , the oam is collinear with the momentum , @xmath56 .",
    "the inner product in eq .  ( 6 ) implies integration over the proper area of space .",
    "formally , the bessel beams are not localized , i.e. , can not be normalized in the whole space .",

    "we verified numerically that the normalized energy , momentum , and oam of such beam are in perfect agreement with eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) when the integration is performed over the area @xmath65 .",

    "1a ) , geometrically , @xmath66 represents the radius - vector of the _ center of the circle _ , whereas @xmath67 points in the direction _ normal to the circle _ and has a magnitude equal to the vortex charge @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the collinearity @xmath56 holds true for any circle on the isofrequency sphere , i.e. , for any axially - symmetric monochromatic beam .",
    "however , as soon as we abandon the monochromaticity constraint , it is possible to construct a bessel - beam - type solution with @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , _ any _ circle in @xmath21-space can serve as a plane - wave spectrum for the beam .",
    "the only fundamental constraint of the mass hyperboloid ( 2 ) can always be satisfied by choosing the corresponding frequencies @xmath69 .",
    "thus , considering different spectral circles with vortex phases ( see an example in fig .",
    "2a ) , we obtain different vortex solutions of the wave equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the center of the circle and the normal to the circle still represent the mean momentum and intrinsic oam of the beam , respectively .",
    "the simplest transformation shifting the spectral circle away from the isofrequency sphere is a uniform transverse shift ( e.g. , along the @xmath70-axis ) of all the wave vectors in the bessel - beam spectrum ( fig .",
    "2a ) : @xmath71 solutions with spectrum ( 9 ) are polychromatic because of the @xmath72 dependence ( here @xmath73 is the wave vector component of the original monochromatic beam ) . remarkably , the beam spectrum ( 9 ) represents a circle with an azimuthal phase gradient not only when projected onto the @xmath74 plane , but also a similar vortex loop around @xmath75 in the @xmath76 plane .",
    "thus , this is a vortex loop on the mass hyperboloid in @xmath77 space , which demonstrates its _ spatio - temporal _ nature , see fig .  3a .",
    "formally , the wave function of the beam can be written as a fourier integral ( 3 ) with the delta - function spectrum ( 4 ) shifted by the transformation ( 9 ) .",

    "the intensity distribution represents the bessel function : @xmath80 ^ 2 $ ] , but the current and phase distributions differ significantly as compared with the monochromatic beam ( 5 ) ( fig",
    "indeed , there is a net transverse current flowing in the @xmath70-direction ( because of the mean @xmath81 ) , whereas the phase dislocation in the beam centre becomes of mixed _ edge - screw _ type .",
    "this is seen from the fork - like pattern of the phase fronts instead of the radial pattern characteristic of screw dislocations . calculating the wave - field distributions at @xmath82",
    ", we see that the beam _ moves in the transverse @xmath70-direction _ and experiences shape distortions .",
    "the deformations represent _ diffraction in time _",
    "caused by the accumulated phase difference between waves with different frequencies ( 10 ) .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "2b shows that this diffraction breaks the @xmath28th - order phase dislocation at @xmath79 into @xmath83 basic dislocations of strengths at @xmath82 .",
    "this can be regarded as a temporal manifestation of the general instability of higher - order vortices with respect to perturbations [ 1,2,19 ] .",
    "the moving edge - screw dislocation reveals a spatio - temporal character of the shifted - spectrum vortex beam . to illustrate this",

    ", we obtain @xmath88 here the beam centroid moves in the transverse direction according to the free - space equation of motion : @xmath89 .",

    "note that lorentz transformation to a moving reference frame , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is velocity ) , provides a boost of the four - momentum in the spectrum , @xmath93 , and can generate polychromatic moving solutions .",

    "while we have discussed the simplest _ vortex - beam _ configurations , belonging to the bessel - beam family , note that optical vortex _",
    "lattices _ can appear from the generic interference of only three monochromatic plane waves [ 22 ] . in a similar manner ,",
    "an infinite lattice of spatio - temporal vortices can appear from the generic interference of three plane waves with different wave vectors and frequencies .",
    "this offers a simple way of generating spatio - temporal vortices in an optical laboratory .    in this work we only considered scalar waves and orbital angular momentum . for vector ( e.g. , electromagnetic ) waves carrying _ spin _ angular momentum",

    "indeed , the spin angular momentum is produced by a circulating _ spin current _ , which , however , does not transport energy [ 17,23 ] .",
    "this current is unrelated to phase gradients and have specific properties distinct from those of the regular orbital current .",
    "although one could expect that the integral angular momentum of the beam is transformed in the same way independently of its spin or orbital nature , the internal deformations of the beam can be different .",
    "for instance , it is known that spin has a purely _ intrinsic _ nature , and can not have extrinsic contributions produced by the relativistic hall effect , eq .",
