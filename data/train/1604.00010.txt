    "we define ` warm jupiters ' to be gas - giant planets with projected mass @xmath7 jupiter masses ( @xmath8 ) and semimajor axis in the range @xmath9 au . as of september 2015 @xmath10",
    "warm jupiters had been discovered in radial - velocity ( rv ) surveys , compared to 40 planets in the same mass range with @xmath11 au ( commonly called ` hot jupiters ' ) and @xmath12 with @xmath13 au .",
    "the warm jupiters have median eccentricity @xmath14 and median pericenter distance @xmath15 au .",
    "most ( @xmath16 ) are in single - planet systems without any detected companions , although recent studies suggest that roughly half of the warm jupiters ( and also the hot jupiters ) have distant ( @xmath17 au ) planetary - mass companions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the warm jupiters is unexplained .",
    "both hot and warm jupiters are thought to have formed beyond the ice - line at a few au and then migrated inward ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main candidate mechanisms for large - scale orbital migration are disk - driven migration and high - eccentricity migration . in the former process",
    ", the planet migrates by transferring its orbital angular momentum to the surrounding gaseous protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in the latter the planet attains very high eccentricity by one of a variety of mechanisms and then tidal dissipation from the host star circularizes the orbit at small semimajor axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    neither of these mechanisms can easily account for the warm jupiters . for disk - driven migration",
    "it is unclear why the migration stopped partway ( e.g. , @xcite ) and why most of the warm jupiters have relatively high eccentricities ( @xmath18 ) , as disk - planet interactions tend to damp rather than excite the eccentricities @xcite , and eccentricity excitation through planet - planet gravitational scattering after migration is ineffective , because scattering at small semimajor axes generally leads to collisions between the planets @xcite . for high - eccentricity migration ,",
    "the main challenge is to explain why most of the warm jupiters have pericenter distances @xmath19 au at which tidal forces are too weak to produce significant migration .    in this paper",
    ", we study a mechanism that overcomes  or at least alleviates  this last difficulty within the high - eccentricity migration scenario .",
    "we argue that warm jupiters periodically reach smaller pericenter distances than their current ones by exchanging angular momentum with a distant massive perturber ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this picture ,",
    "warm jupiters are observed today at the low - eccentricity ( or large pericenter distance ) phase of such oscillations , while migration occurs during the high - eccentricity phase ; thus , given enough time , all warm jupiters would evolve into hot jupiters .",
    "one possibility for the distant massive perturber is a stellar or planetary companion on a highly inclined orbit . in this case",
    "warm jupiters may exchange angular momentum with the perturber through kozai ",
    "lidov oscillations ( @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the stellar - companion scenario is able to produce some but not all of the hot jupiters @xcite , and it can reproduce the orbital architecture of the highly eccentric ( @xmath20 ) warm jupiter hd 80606b ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , @xcite showed that the stellar - companion scenario can not produce all of the hot jupiters , and also generally can not produce enough warm jupiters  the migration proceeds too fast so the migrating planet spends only a small fraction of its lifetime at intermediate semimajor axes between the cold ( @xmath21 au ) and hot jupiters ( @xmath22 au ) .",
    "alternatively , the kozai ",
    "lidov oscillations can be driven by a distant and highly inclined planetary companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a second possibility is that the warm jupiters change their orbital angular momenta through secular perturbations from a nearly coplanar and eccentric perturber such as a distant giant planet @xcite . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "this planetary - companion scenario can account for most of the hot jupiters , but it produces warm jupiters at a rate that is too low and with eccentricities that are too large compared to the observations .    in this work",
    "we examine the effects of secular gravitational interactions with a distant perturber considering the general case in which the perturber ( either a planet or a star ) is in an eccentric and/or highly inclined orbit .",
    "thus , these perturbations include the kozai ",
    "lidov mechanism , the coplanar and eccentric case , and possible combinations of these two .",
    "although our main results are applicable to either the planetary- or the binary - companion scenarios , we focus most our attention on the former scenario because it seems to be a more promising mechanism for explaining the warm jupiters .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of the stellar - companion scenario in  [ sec : binary ] .",
    "the frequency and orbital properties of distant ( @xmath23 au ) companions of the warm jupiters are largely unknown ; the principal constraints come from linear trends in the radial - velocity curves of the host star .",
    "one critical and largely unconstrained orbital element for our purposes is the mutual inclination between the planet and the companion orbit @xmath24 , which has been measured only in a few exceptional examples such as kepler-419 b and c ( @xmath25 au , @xmath26 au , @xmath27 ; @xcite ) and upsilon andromedae c and d ( @xmath28 au , @xmath29 au , and @xmath30 ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite examined stars hosting warm jupiters and a second planet at larger semimajor axis and observed that the sky - plane apsidal separations @xmath31 clustered around @xmath32 .",
    "they argued that this clustering implies that the mutual inclinations @xmath33 oscillate between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we first describe the properties of an outer perturber that are needed to produce low- or moderate - eccentricity warm jupiters .",
    "the characteristic timescale for the eccentricity oscillations due to an outer perturber is the kozai ",
    "lidov timescale @xcite : _",
    "= ( 1-e^2)^3/2 , [ eq : tau_kl ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the masses of the host star , the planet , and the outer perturber ( the planetary or stellar companion ) .",

    "the period of the eccentricity oscillations is longer than the kozai ",
    "lidov timescale by a factor of order @xmath44 because the oscillations arise from octupole rather than quadrupole terms in the gravitational potential from the outer perturber @xcite . in this case",
    "the conditions for eccentricity oscillation are even more stringent than those we give below .    in order for a migrating warm jupiter ( @xmath45 ) to be undergoing eccentricity oscillations",
    ", we require at least the following two conditions :    1 .   the migration rate must be slow relative to the oscillation period due to secular perturbations .",
    "+ more specifically , the secular torque from the companion should be strong enough that it can change the planet s pericenter distance before tidal dissipation is able to shrink the semimajor axis . in the opposite limit , when the migration is fast",
    ", the planet migrates at roughly constant angular momentum , thereby producing only high - eccentricity warm jupiters , with pericenters small enough that tidal dissipation is always important @xcite .",
    "+ we can quantify the condition for slow migration by comparing the timescale on which the secular torque changes the pericenter distance , @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and the migration timescale @xmath48 . in the high - eccentricity limit ( @xmath49 ) which is relevant for migration ,",
    "the former timescale can be computed from @xmath50 and reduces to @xmath51 , , in which case the expression for @xmath52 in equation ( [ eq : r_p ] ) changes only slightly : the coefficient changes from 0.01 au to @xmath53 au , the exponent of @xmath39 changes from 3 to @xmath54 , and the exponent of the square brackets changes from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the results in @xcite are unchanged if he used the expression @xmath52 from equation ( [ eq : r_p ] ) . ] while the latter is @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the love number of the planet and @xmath59 is the viscous time of the planet .",

    "we have @xmath65 and the planet migrates fast , at roughly constant angular momentum . on the contrary",
    ", if @xmath66 is even slightly larger than @xmath52 the strong dependence of tidal dissipation on @xmath66 ensures that @xmath67 and the planet undergoes slow migration .",
    "2 .   the pericenter precession rate due to extra forces must be slow relative to the precession due to secular perturbations .",
    "+ if the inner planet is undergoing slow migration and its migration timescale is less than the age of the system , then the eccentricity oscillations will continue down to a critical semimajor axis @xmath68 at which extra forces make the inner orbit precess fast enough that the eccentricity oscillations are quenched . as shown by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "if the dominant precession force is general relativity , as is often the case , this critical semimajor axis is a_in , crit & & 0.5 ( ) ^4/7 ( ) ^2/7 + & & ( ) ^6/7 .",

    "we now study the time - averaged eccentricity distribution of a planet that undergoes migration due to secular gravitational interactions from an outer perturber .",

    "although this choice of parameters is somewhat arbitrary , it is motivated by one of the models of @xcite , who shows that the detection probability with signal - to - noise ratio 10 and @xmath312 observations is 1 for @xmath313 and drops to 0.5 and 0.1 for @xmath314 and @xmath315 , respectively .",

    "we have examined the expected eccentricity distribution of warm jupiters that migrate through a combination of secular gravitational interactions with a distant companion and tidal dissipation ( `` high - eccentricity migration '' ) .",
    "our main result is that the expected distribution is approximately flat ( @xmath320 ) .",
    "this result partially resolves the well - known problem that warm jupiters can not have reached their current semimajor axes through high - eccentricity migration because their pericenter distances are too large to allow for significant tidal dissipation by the host star .    however , our model can not fully reproduce the eccentricity distribution of the warm jupiters because it does not produce enough planets with eccentricities @xmath321 ( figure [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is eliminated if we consider only warm jupiters in systems containing outer planetary companions or linear rv trends suggesting a distant stellar or planetary companion  and of course such a companion is required in our model .",
    "the population of low - eccentricity warm jupiters ( @xmath1 ) must be largely formed by a different mechanism .",

    "in what follows , we describe other results and predictions from high - eccentricity migration and compare our work with previous studies .",
    "we discuss how the hot jupiter population produced in our simulations of high - eccentricity migration compares to the observed population .",
    "first , in our simulations the ratio between the number of hot jupiters and the number of gas giant planets is @xmath322@xmath323 . this ratio is consistent with the observed rate of @xmath324@xmath325 , derived using the occurrence rate of hot jupiters , @xmath326@xmath327 @xcite , and that of gas - giant planets at au distances , @xmath328 @xcite .",
    "however , the hot jupiter production rate derived from our models depends strongly on the initial conditions because the planets migrate only if they initially have either high mutual inclinations or large eccentricities ( panel b in figure [ fig : pop ] ) .",
    "second , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : sma ] and shown in figure [ fig : a_sim_rv ] , our model predicts that the semimajor axes of hot jupiters are strongly concentrated in the range @xmath259@xmath260 au ( orbital period of @xmath324@xmath329 days ) , roughly consistent with the distribution observed in both the rv and _ kepler _ samples @xcite .",
    "this pile - up arises because there is a minimum pericenter distance at which the eccentricity excitation is limited by extra precession forces ( general relativity and/or tidal bulges , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "third , the obliquity distribution predicted by our population synthesis model is broad ( see upper panel in figure [ fig : psi ] ) .",
    "we successfully reproduce the observed ratio between the numbers of retrograde and prograde systems , but fail to explain the sharp peak in the distribution at projected obliquities @xmath330 produced by @xmath272 of the observed sample of hot jupiters .",
    "roughly @xmath331 of the hot jupiters with low obliquities ( @xmath274 of the current sample ) , must be produced by a different mechanism .    in summary ,",
    "based on the production rates , the semimajor axis and stellar obliquity distributions we suggest that high - eccentricity migration can account for most of the hot jupiters .",
    "a fraction of the low - obliquity hot jupiters must be formed by a different mechanism .",
    "we discuss how the warm jupiter population produced in our simulations compares to the observed population .",
    "our model can explain the eccentricity distribution of warm jupiters observed in samples b or c of  [ sec : ecc_obs ] , i.e. , the 15 systems with outer planetary companions or the 22 systems with companions or rv trends . for comparison",
    "the total number of systems with warm jupiters is 96 .",
    "thus , our model can potentially account for @xmath332 to @xmath333 of the whole population of warm jupiters  more in the likely case that not all companions have been detected so far .",
    "an independent estimate of the production rate of warm jupiters is given by our population synthesis models .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : rate ] , we find that the relative rates of production of hot and warm jupiters do not depend strongly on the initial conditions , and our model predicts that the ratio of hot jupiters to warm jupiters should be roughly 2 .",
    "this is larger than the observed ratio in the rv sample , @xmath243 , by a factor of @xmath244@xmath245 .",
    "therefore , if our mechanism accounts for most of the hot jupiters ( see previous subsection ) , then we expect that it also accounts for @xmath222@xmath246 of the systems with warm jupiters , consistent with the estimate from the preceding paragraph .    in summary , by comparing the relative production rates of hot and warm jupiters with the inferred values from observations , we conclude that our mechanism can account for @xmath222@xmath246 of the systems with warm jupiters .",
    "this number matches the fraction of @xmath2 derived from the eccentricity distribution of warm jupiters in systems with outer companions .",
    "we have shown that our model can account for most of the hot jupiters and @xmath2 of the warm jupiters .",
    "two natural predictions from the high - eccentricity migration model discussed in this paper are : ( i ) the presence of long - period planetary companions in most of the hot jupiter systems ; ( ii ) the presence of long - period planetary companions in at least @xmath2 of the warm jupiter systems , typically those in which the warm jupiter has @xmath18 .",
    "recent studies show that the occurrence rate of distant ( @xmath334@xmath335 au ) planetary - mass companions of hot jupiters is @xmath336 , which is consistent with the prediction that high - eccentricity migration can account for most of the hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite constrain the occurrence rate of long - period ( @xmath17 au ) planetary - mass companions of warm jupiters to @xmath337 .",
    "this number is larger than the @xmath2 predicted by our model of high - eccentricity migration , but we expect that a fraction of these systems with the most distant of the planetary companions do not contribute to the warm jupiter formation because the kl oscillations can be quenched by gr ( see eq .

    "[ sec : itot ] our model predicts that the systems with hot and warm jupiters should have outer planetary companions in inclined orbits .    for hot jupiters ,",
    "we find that the distribution of mutual inclinations peaks at @xmath285 with a spread of @xmath338 around this value ( see the black line in figure [ fig : inc ] ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : itot ] , this peak is a feature of the kozai  lidov oscillations of the inner planet in which the planet circularizes when it reaches a maximum eccentricity , which generally happens at a minimum inclination close to @xmath285 .    in contrast , the warm jupiters should have companions with larger mutual inclinations than the hot jupiters , typically in the range @xmath339@xmath269 ( see figure [ fig : inc ] ) . as described in  [ sec : itot ] , the larger value arises because hot jupiters are found at the minimum inclination achieved during a kozai ",

    "at present little is known about the mutual inclinations of massive planets .",
    "a notable exception is an astrometric measurement of the mutual inclination of @xmath340 and c and d , @xmath341 @xcite .",
    "we expect that the _ gaia _ space telescope can measure this angle for many of the hot and warm jupiters with detected outer companions out to @xmath244 au ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : psi ] we expect that the warm jupiters formed by secular planet - planet interactions will have an approximately uniform distribution of stellar spin - orbit angles in the range @xmath342@xmath343 ( see the lower panel in figure [ fig : psi ] ) .",
    "future space missions such as _ tess _ @xcite and _ plato _ @xcite will discover hundreds or even thousands of warm jupiters in bright stars amenable to rossiter - mclaughin measurements of the projected spin - orbit angle .",
    "ground - based transit surveys are also expected to find many warm jupiters , with periods @xmath344 days ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion on the expected rates ) .",
    "two recent examples are hats-17b with a period of 16.3 days @xcite and wasp-130b with a period of 11.2 days @xcite",
    ".    it would be particularly informative to compare the obliquities of the warm jupiters in eccentric orbits with outer companions , which can likely be explained by high - eccentricity migration , to a sample of low - eccentricity warm jupiters without outer companions , which must have formed by a different mechanism and presumably have much smaller obliquities .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of recent work on high - eccentricity planet migration .",
    "@xcite suggested that a population of 6 systems with eccentric warm jupiters and outer planetary companions might be undergoing kozai  lidov migration .",
    "this claim is based on the clustering of the relative apsidal angles of these planets at around @xmath32 . since the outer companions in these systems are eccentric ( @xmath345@xmath266 ) and the kozai ",
    "lidov oscillations are modulated by the octupole timescale , the authors argue that these planets are undergoing a slow version of kozai  lidov migration , which preferentially produces warm jupiters over hot jupiters .",
    "our results are consistent with @xcite in the sense that we find that in a steady state the planets that are most likely to be observed as warm jupiters tend to have a significant octupolar modulation of the eccentricity oscillations ( because such planets spend less time at very high eccentricities and therefore have slower migration rates ) .",
    "in particular , in figure [ fig : n_e_erg_quad ] we show the family of eccentricity distributions for a migrating planet in two limits : the quadrupole approximation ( no octupole contribution ) and the ergodic approximation ( strong octupole contribution ) .",
    "this figure shows that in the quadrupole approximation the eccentricity distribution diverges as @xmath346 , while in the ergodic approximation the distribution is a decreasing function of the eccentricity as @xmath346 .",
    "however , contrary to the results by @xcite , we do not observe a significant clustering of the relative apsidal angles ( @xmath347 , the difference in the longitudes of pericenter measured relative to the invariable plane ) around @xmath32 in our simulated systems containing warm jupiters .",
    "these results suggest that either ( i ) the clustering observed by dawson & chiang , which looks persuasive but is based on only six systems containing a warm jupiter and an outer companion , is an unlikely statistical fluke ; ( ii ) the clustering arises through some unrecognized selection effect ; or ( iii ) the clustering arises for particular ranges of other other orbital elements that are much more densely populated in real systems containing warm jupiters than in our simulations .",
    "these issues deserve further investigation .",
    "@xcite proposed that most hot jupiters , but almost no warm jupiters , could be formed by a process he called `` coplanar high - eccentricity migration''secular interactions of two nearly coplanar eccentric planets . consistent with these results we find that planets starting with low mutual inclinations and high eccentricities migrate rapidly ( see panel a of figure [ fig : ss_e ] ) and are , therefore , expected to produce hot jupiters rather than warm jupiters .",
    "@xcite have recently studied the possibility that a population of warm jupiters migrating through the kl mechanism can be depleted as the host star evolves off the main sequence and grows in radius .",
    "these authors study the eccentricity distribution of the warm jupiters and , in contrast to the present paper ( see figure [ fig : e_sim_ss ] ) , find that the eccentricity distribution is strongly peaked at low eccentricities ( figure 17 of frewen & hansen ) .",
    "we may understand this difference from the particular set of initial conditions used by @xcite , in which the inner and outer planet both start on nearly circular orbits ( @xmath348 ) .",
    "this choice limits the family of eccentricity distributions in figure [ fig : n_e_erg_quad ] to only one , which would be approximated by the dashed black and blue lines in the top panel of figure [ fig : n_e_erg_quad ] ( quadrupole approximation with @xmath349 ) .",
    "however , their calculations do not show the extra lower - amplitude peak at @xmath76 found in our quadrupole distributions , possibly because this peak is shifted to a range of lower values in @xmath350 since their warm jupiters are initialized at @xmath351 au and reach minimum pericenter distances @xmath352 au .",
    "note that even if the inner planet starts in a circular orbit , but the perturber is eccentric so its potential has a significant octupolar moment , the expected eccentricity distributions are generally not peaked at low eccentricities ( see solid lines in figure [ fig : n_e_erg_quad ] ) .",
    "very recently , @xcite carried out a numerical study of the formation of hot and warm jupiters from kozai ",
    "lidov oscillations induced by planetary perturbers .",
    "consistent with our main result , their simulations show that the warm jupiters formed by this mechanism have a nearly flat eccentricity distribution .",
    "however , the authors claim that most of the observed warm jupiters with outer planetary companions are not formed through high - eccentricity migration .",
    "their claim is based on the observation that if the inner planet in these systems started migration beyond @xmath318 au , then these systems would have been dynamically unstable .",
    "while the dynamical stability of the pre - migration system is an important constraint on the observed systems , all of the systems in our population synthesis study are stable ( according to equation [ eq : stability ] ) so this result does not affect our numerical experiments .",
    "the main results of this paper are valid whether the outer perturber is a planet or a star ( see , e.g. , figure [ fig : ss_e_param ] ) .",
    "we have assumed a planetary - mass companion in most of our discussion , motivated by the observation that warm jupiters in systems with outer planets have a broad eccentricity distribution consistent with our model , whereas those in systems without outer planets mostly have @xmath353 .",
    "here we briefly discuss what conditions are required for the stellar - companion scenario to explain the warm jupiters .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : conditions ] , there are at least two conditions for a migrating warm jupiter to be undergoing eccentricity oscillations :    *   _ the migration rate must be slow relative to the secular perturbations_. as shown by @xcite , the kozai ",
    "lidov mechanism in wide stellar binaries ( @xmath354 au ) generally leads to fast migration and , therefore , produces almost no warm jupiters ( similar results are shown in @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior is mostly due to the strong octupole - level modulation of the kozai ",
    "lidov mechanism in stellar binaries , which pumps up the eccentricity to extremely high values , enhancing the fraction of the planets that migrate rapidly ( in the sense of equation [ eq : r_p ] ) or are tidally disrupted .",
    "we expect that this effect is more pronounced in stellar binaries for two different reasons .",
    "first , stellar binaries are more eccentric ( mean eccentricity of @xmath355 at separations of @xmath356 au ; e.g , @xcite ) than the cold jupiters ( mean eccentricity of @xmath357 ) and , therefore , the octupole forcing can have more dramatic effects in stellar binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , contrary to the case of stellar companions , the orbits of planetary companions can change their angular momentum significantly in timescales comparable to that of the octupole , often leading to less extreme eccentricities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . *",
    "_ precession due to secular perturbations has to be faster than the precession due to general relativity_. from equation ( [ eq : acrit ] ) we observe that this requirement implies that warm jupiters within @xmath358 au must have stellar binary companions with masses of @xmath359 ( @xmath360 ) within @xmath361 au ( @xmath362 au ) .",
    "the frequency of stellar companions at these orbital separations in warm - jupiter systems remains largely unconstrained , and the constraints on stellar companions in hot - jupiter systems are difficult to interpret .",
    "recently @xcite searched for low - mass stellar companions within @xmath362 au around systems with hot jupiters ( not warm jupiters ) .",
    "they found no evidence of an excess of binary companions relative to field stars , suggesting that hot jupiters are not preferentially formed in these systems .",
    "then , if most hot jupiters are not formed by the kl mechanism in stellar binaries within @xmath362 au , we expect that only a small fraction of the warm jupiters can be explained by this channel because our numerical experiments indicate that the rate of formation of hot jupiters is higher that of warm jupiters ( a factor of @xmath363 for binaries , see below ) , while the observations indicate the opposite  there are twice as many warm jupiters than hot jupiters . on the other hand , @xcite recently found evidence that the stellar multiplicity fraction of companions at @xmath364 au is a factor of @xmath365 higher for stars hosting a gas giant planet candidate from the kepler sample , compared to a control sample with no planet detections .",
    "we have carried out a population synthesis study similar to that in figure [ fig : pop ] , but changing the semimajor axis and mass ranges of the perturber from @xmath366@xmath367 au and @xmath368 to @xmath369@xmath370 au and @xmath371 , so the the amplitude of the quadrupole potential @xmath372 in equation ( [ eq : phi_0 ] ) lies roughly in the same range .",
    "we observe that the ratio of hot jupiters to warm jupiters formed in these simulations is @xmath373 , compared to @xmath237 in the planetary case .",
    "we also repeated the experiment with a broader eccentricity distribution  uniform in @xmath374 over @xmath238 $ ] compared to @xmath204 $ ] , which is more appropriate for stellar binaries . as expected from our previous discussion , we find that the ratio of hot jupiters to warm jupiters increases , from @xmath373 to @xmath375",
    ". finally , we checked that the eccentricity distributions of the warm jupiters from these experiments are consistent with those from our simple models in  [ sec : ss_e ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "the eccentricity distribution of the warm jupiters predicted by our model is approximately flat regardless of the whether the outer perturber is a planet or a star .",
    "however , the ratio of warm jupiters to hot jupiter is lower ( by a factor @xmath376 ) in the binary - companion case compared to the planetary - companion case , making the latter channel a more likely explanation of the warm jupiters .",
    "in  [ sec : e_ergodic ] we have explored a new analytical model to approximate the time - averaged eccentricity distribution of the inner binary in a hierarchical triple system .",
    "this model is based on the ergodic hypothesis , in which we assume that the planetary orbits randomly populate all the available phase space allowed by conservation of energy .",
    "we have shown that this model can reproduce the eccentricity and momentum coordinate @xmath377 distributions obtained from numerical three - body integrations when the inner orbit populates a significant fraction of its available phase - space ( see figure [ fig : compa55 ] ) .",
    "this last condition is satisfied when there is a strong octupole - level gravitational perturbation from the outer orbit . for simplicity",
    "our discussion assumed that the inner body is a test particle , but the model can be extended to massive inner bodies .",
    "the ergodic hypothesis is motivated by the observation that a distribution function that is uniform on the energy surface in a canonical phase space is always a solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation if the motion is governed by a hamiltonian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus we expect the distribution of systems over the energy surface to be uniform if either the initial conditions sample the phase space uniformly or the motion is sufficiently irregular that the trajectory samples most of the phase space .",
    "a more speculative application of the ergodic hypothesis to planetary systems is described by @xcite .",
    "we have studied the steady - state orbital distribution of giant planets migrating through the combination of secular gravitational perturbations due to a planetary or stellar companion and friction due to tides raised on the planet by the host star ( `` high - eccentricity migration '' ) .",
    "we have shown both analytically and numerically that the eccentricity distribution of warm jupiters arising from this migration mechanism is approximately flat .",
    "this distribution is inconsistent with the observed eccentricity distribution of all of the warm jupiters , which decays approximately linearly from @xmath378 to @xmath111 ( fig.[fig : hist ] ) , but roughly consistent with the eccentricity distribution of warm jupiters with detected outer planetary companions , such as would be required for high - eccentricity migration to occur .",
    "both the observed eccentricity distribution and the observed ratio of hot jupiters to warm jupiters are consistent with a model in which @xmath379 of warm jupiters and most of the warm jupiters with eccentricity @xmath380 are produced by high - eccentricity migration .",
    "we also find that high - eccentricity migration induced by a distant planetary companion can account for the semimajor axes , the stellar obliquities , and occurrence rates of most of the hot jupiters .",
    "thus we are led to a model in which ( i ) high - eccentricity migration produces most of the hot jupiters ; ( ii ) high - eccentricity migration produces the @xmath2 of warm jupiters with @xmath381 ; ( iii ) most of the remaining population of low - eccentricity warm jupiters must be accounted for by a different mechanism .",
    "we also provide predictions for the mutual inclinations , spin - orbit angles , and other properties of the hot and warm jupiters produced by high - eccentricity migration that can be used to test this model .",
    "we calculate the time - averaged eccentricity distribution for the orbit of an inner test particle that evolves due to the quadrupole potential from an external body .",
    "we work in a coordinate system centered on the host star , of mass @xmath36 , in which the equator coincides with the orbit of the outer body .",
    "we use delaunay elements @xmath382 , @xmath383 , @xmath384 ; their conjugate angles @xmath385 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 are respectively the mean anomaly , argument of pericenter , and longitude of the node of the test particle",
    ".    the doubly time - averaged hamiltonian that represents the gravitational potential of the outer body up to quadrupole order is obtained by converting equation ( [ eq : phi_oct ] ) to orbital elements and dropping terms of order @xmath138 : _ q=- .",

    "since the hamiltonian is time - independent , the energy is also conserved .",
