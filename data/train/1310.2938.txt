    "furthermore , all these techniques reach their limit at @xmath16 due to the lack of mature cluster components .",
    "it is important that we go to higher redshifts to probe the epoch of cluster formation .",
    "first of all , some of the most massive clusters at @xmath15 appear remarkably mature , with a sufficiently deep potential well of dark matter halo , red sequence , and icm in place , suggesting formation redshifts for most of their stellar contents much beyond 2 @xcite . secondly , opposite to the morphology / star formation ",
    "density relation seen in the local universe @xcite , galaxies in dense regions at high redshifts are found to experience enhanced star formation , interactions , and/or accelerated evolution , and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity @xcite although a full consensus has not yet been reached .",
    "thus , for a full census of cluster formation , it is important that we study them near the peak in the cosmic star formation and agn activity at @xmath17 @xcite .    at @xmath18 ,",
    "the so - called `` proto - clusters '' are predicted to have significant , large - scale overdensities of galaxies , allowing us to trace the evolution of clusters beyond the limit of traditional techniques .",
    "some observational efforts have been made to search , identify , and characterize these proto - clusters with different techniques .",
    "overdensities of narrow - band - selected emission line galaxies have been found around highly biased tracers like radio galaxies @xcite and in `` random '' fields . also , galaxy concentrations having a similarly narrow range in velocities have been discovered as part of spectroscopic follow - up of photo-@xmath19 or color - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "although limited by small number statistics , these studies have revealed some intriguing properties of proto - clusters .",

    ", the galaxies are on average older than field galaxies @xcite , supporting the picture of accelerated galaxy formations in dense environments well before the clusters were fully formed .",
    "recently , abnormal metallicities for proto - cluster galaxies have been reported @xcite .",
    "merging subclusters showing properties consistent with transitional stages between proto - clusters and clusters are also found @xcite .",
    "a rich set of questions could be studied with proto - clusters .",
    "are the abundance and growth of clusters consistent with the concordance cosmology and models of structure formation ?",
    "how exactly do clusters assemble from the filamentary cosmic web , and how do they evolve from `` proto '' to mature ?",
    "how do their galaxies become quenched in concordance with the red sequence and the morphology  density relation ? however , it has been a challenge to answer such questions , mainly due to the observational and the intrinsic variety of the `` proto - cluster zoo '' , combined with the fact that cluster progenitors , like clusters , are extremely rare .",
    "one way in which this could be achieved is through a more thorough comparison between theoretical predictions and simulations .",
    "@xcite used analytical descriptions of structure formation theory to derive the total dark matter overdensity associated with one of the first proto - clusters discovered at @xmath22 , allowing them to infer a total mass for the descendant cluster and its likely redshift of virialization ( see also @xcite for a similar case study at @xmath16 ) .    in reality , the cluster formation process is much more complex as it depends on the hierarchical growth of dark matter and galaxies in three - dimensions on both large and small scales .",
    "a first step toward tracing the progenitor structures of galaxy clusters in @xmath23cdm was performed by @xcite .",
    "they used cosmological ( @xmath24-body ) simulations to statistically quantify the overdensities in dark matter ( halos ) associated with clusters .",
    "they showed that some of the structures observed at high redshifts indeed have properties expected of proto - clusters , and derived probabilities for a given overdensity in dark matter to evolve into a cluster by @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite used an extremely large - volume simulation to study the evolution of the most massive halos at @xmath25 , pointing out that the most massive halos do not always become the most massive clusters at @xmath1 .",
    "the key factor that determines the final fate of high redshift halos is the surrounding matter overdensity on very large - scales , which is a much better indicator of its @xmath1 mass , @xmath26 , than the halo mass by itself .",
    "one complication of these kinds of theory  observation comparisons is the connection between the dark matter and the galaxies .",
    "@xcite ran hydro - dynamical simulations of cluster formation to compare the properties of galaxies and the icm with those in a well - studied proto - cluster at @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite used the millennium run ( mr ) simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation to predict the physical and observational properties of brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "an even closer match between simulations and observations can be achieved by constructing mock redshift surveys , and mimicking the various observational selection effects .",
    "for example , using this technique @xcite was able to compare observations and simulations of the environments of quasi - stellar objects at @xmath25 as possible progenitor regions of galaxy clusters .",
    "it has become clear that if we want to directly target the epoch of cluster formation , we need to develop reliable tools that can relate the main observables of proto - clusters to their main physical characteristics .",
    "analogous to studies of galaxy formation , these tools need to be able to distinguish between structures of different masses , ages , and formation histories . in this paper ,",
    "the first of a series of papers on the early formation history of galaxy clusters , we will present the characteristic properties for a sample of @xmath28 galaxy proto - clusters in the mr .",
    "we study the statistical properties of overdensities in the distribution of dark matter , dark matter halos , and galaxies as a function of redshift , observational window size , and various halo and galaxy tracers . by comparing with random regions ,",
    "we derive the conditional probability that a structure with a given large - scale mass distribution is indeed a proto - cluster .",
    "we also show how the @xmath1 cluster mass can be estimated from the overdensity of galaxies , and how we could distinguish between progenitors of `` fornax '' , `` virgo '' , and `` coma '' type clusters at redshifts as high as @xmath29 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our simulations - assisted approach and give our main definitions related to proto - clusters . in section 3",
    ", we present the @xmath23cdm predictions for cluster assembly , size growth , overdensity evolution for fields and proto - clusters , as well as the identification and mass estimation for proto - clusters . in section 4",
    ", we discuss our results and make a preliminary comparison with recent observations .",
    "we summarize our work in section 5 .",
    "if unspecified , the cosmological parameters used are based on @xmath301 : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath307 cosmology is used when we present a comparison of the results for different cosmologies .",
    "although cluster formation is a continuing process throughout the history of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in this paper we will focus on @xmath37 as it marks the boundary between the epoch at @xmath38 , in which we find the first observational evidence of large virialized clusters , and the epoch in which those first galaxy clusters are presumed to have been forming .    the need for a simulations - assisted approach is obvious .",
    "first , limited by the small number of observed proto - clusters and their varying selection techniques , it is premature to constrain models using these results .",
    "however , based on observations of the local universe and the initial conditions imprinted in the cosmic microwave background , sophisticated cosmological simulations have been able to make highly physically motivated predictions for the high redshift universe .",
    "second , with the coming of future redshift surveys which will provide detailed information with large statistics , it becomes more and more important to extract equally detailed predictions from simulations in order to understand the non - trivial relations between model parameters and observables .",
    "finally , predictions from simulations are crucial to help design observations and optimize analysis techniques . here",
    "we describe the simulations and our methodology in this work .      to study the high redshift progenitors of the most extreme present - day structures and their galaxy contents , we require simulations that span an enormous range in physical length scales , masses , and redshifts , and also have a fine treatment of the most important baryonic processes .",
    "therefore , in this work we use the mr dark matter @xmath24-body simulation @xcite and a recent semi - analytic galaxy formation model @xcite . for detailed descriptions of the methods and implementation , we refer the reader to previous works by the mr group ( e.g. ,",

    "the field dark matter density and the subhalo catalog were stored for these 64 `` snapshots '' .",
    "the merger trees were then constructed by identifying and linking the progenitors and descendants .",
    "recently , a new run based on the @xmath307 cosmology @xcite was released @xcite . in this paper",

    "the basic recipes include gas cooling and infall , reionization heating , black hole growth , agn and supernova feedback , and a realistic gradual gas stripping process that operates when galaxies become satellites .",
    "the free parameters in the model are then determined by matching with the observed galaxy abundance as a function of galaxy properties in the local universe .",

    "specifically , @xcite have shown that for galaxy clusters in the local universe , the cluster abundance , cluster galaxy luminosity function , and galaxy number density profiles match very well with those found in large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey .",

    ", we do not use any photometric predictions of galaxies , as this will add significant additional uncertainties and model assumptions . in future work , however , we will use the millennium run observatory @xcite , a virtual observatory framework built on top of the millennium sam galaxy catalog , in order to more realistically compare simulations with observations .",
    "observationally , galaxy clusters are identified by overdensities of galaxies , dark matter , and hot icm on scales of about 1 mpc .",

    "it is a common belief that the dark matter halo mass is the most important underlying property when distinguishing between clusters , groups , and field galaxies .",
    "all other features of galaxy clusters can , to the first order , be treated as manifestations of halo mass and assembly history .    for these reasons , in the simulations we will define a galaxy cluster as a gravitationally bound and virialized dark matter halo ( and its associated galaxies ) with halo mass @xmath46 @xmath11 @xmath41 .

    "defined by the mass within the radius where the halo has an overdensity equal to the spherical collapse model threshold in our cosmology .",

    "it is important to note that for most practical purposes , the term proto - cluster does not refer to a single virialized object , but rather to a large region in space containing all the dark matter and baryons that merge into one massive bound virialized structure by @xmath1 . by tracing the halo merger trees of all @xmath1 clusters in the mr simulation ,",
    "we are able to identify proto - clusters at high redshifts and quantify their properties predicted in a @xmath23cdm universe . based on these definitions ,",
    "we compile a sample of 2832 galaxy clusters with a halo mass of @xmath46 @xmath11 @xmath41 at @xmath1 .",
    "this sample consists of 1976 low - mass `` fornax - type '' clusters of 1.37@xmath50 @xmath11 , 797 intermediate mass `` virgo - type '' clusters of 3@xmath51 @xmath11 , and 59 high - mass `` coma - type '' clusters of @xmath52 @xmath11 .",
    "the three - dimensional locations of the clusters in the mr are indicated in figure . 1 .",
    "because of the hierarchical nature of the structure formation , galaxy clusters formed in regions with the largest initial overdensities all the way from small to large - scales .",
    "therefore , the progenitors of galaxy clusters have manifested themselves since the earliest time by overdensities of dark matter , halo number , and galaxy number within a certain volume .",
    "we use the common definitions of matter , halo , and galaxy overdensities as follows : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are overdensities of dark matter , halo , and galaxy number , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the ensemble averages of the density of dark matter , halo , and galaxy number , respectively . the ergodic principle is applied to calculate these values .",
    "when calculating @xmath62 and @xmath8 , properties of halos ( usually mass ) and galaxies ( e.g. , stellar mass and sfr ) need to be specified .",
    "in addition , these overdensities are typically calculated in windows with different sizes , shapes , and weighting profiles . in this work , we use tophat weighted cubic windows of various sizes in comoving coordinates .",
    "these windows should be large , ranging from a few to several tens of mpc , in appreciation of the fact that galaxy proto - clusters are generally very large .",
    "in this section we present @xmath23cdm predicted properties of proto - clusters extracted from the mr simulation and sam galaxy catalog . in the previous section , we identified 2832 galaxy clusters with halo mass @xmath63 @xmath11 @xmath41 at @xmath1 ( see figure 1 ) . here",
    "we trace their progenitors to high redshifts .",
    "the center of a proto - cluster is defined as the center of mass of its member halos .",
    "to relate the structures to observables , we quantify the key features such as mass , size , assembly history , overdensities of dark matter , halo , and galaxies . by comparing proto - cluster regions with random fields",
    ", we are able to statistically classify structures given a set of observed features .",
    "the length scales presented here are in comoving units .      under our definition ,",
    "the birth of a galaxy cluster can be dated to the redshift at which the mass of the main halo first exceeded @xmath64 @xmath11 .",
    "further relaxation and virialization may be achieved after about one dynamical time , which is about @xmath65 yr , an order of magnitude shorter than the hubble time . in figure 2 ( left ) , we show the most massive progenitor halo mass , @xmath66 , of our mr cluster sample binned by @xmath26 as a function of redshift .",
    "results based on @xmath301 ( solid ) and @xmath307 ( dotted ) cosmologies are presented .",
    "medians and @xmath67 scatter ( 15.865th and 84.135th percentile ) of each bin are plotted . in general , massive clusters form earlier .",
    "the assembly redshifts for `` coma '' ( @xmath68 @xmath11 ) , `` virgo '' ( 3@xmath69 @xmath11 ) , and `` fornax '' ( 1.37@xmath50 @xmath11 ) type clusters are about 1.52.3 , 0.71.6 and 0.21 , respectively . that is to say ,",
    "the first objects that reached the `` threshold '' cluster mass of @xmath70 @xmath11 were likely the progenitors of `` coma - type '' and more massive clusters at around @xmath71 , while low - mass clusters made the transition from proto - cluster to cluster much more recently .",
    "the high value of @xmath72 and low value of @xmath73 in the @xmath301 run partially compensate each other ( demonstrated in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that clusters form at only slightly higher redshifts ( @xmath74 ) compared to the @xmath307 run .",
    "our results of cluster halo mass growth are consistent with those found by the rhapsody cluster simulations @xcite .",
    "we note that cluster formation and halo assembly are ongoing processes .",
    "according to figure 2 ( left ) , to keep increasing the mass , a high redshift proto - cluster must be surrounded by many smaller halos waiting to be assembled onto the main halos .",
    "the sizes of these extended structures are quantified in the right panel of figure 2 ( see the next subsection for details ) .      at the redshifts prior to that at which a cluster assembles most of its mass into one single structure , a proto - cluster consists of many halos separated within a much larger volume . to quantify the spatial distribution and the size of the whole structure ,",
    "we introduce , for the first time , an effective radius @xmath2 of proto - clusters .",
    "we define @xmath2 by the second moment of the member halo positions weighted by halo mass , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total mass of the proto - cluster in bound halos at the redshift of interest , @xmath77 is the mass of each halo and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the position of each halo and the center of mass for the whole proto - cluster , respectively .",
    "we set a lower limit of @xmath2 to the half mass radius of the main cluster halo since once a cluster finished its assembly into a single halo , equation ( 4 ) gives a spatial dispersion of zero . in this case",
    ", the size of the main halo properly indicates the scale at which the mass is distributed .",
    "we note that in our definition @xmath2 is fundamental and sam independent .",
    "@xmath2 is representative of the proto - cluster size , in a sense that a significant fraction of mass is within this radius . at @xmath80 , about @xmath81 of the mass in bound halos and @xmath82 of the total mass of the proto - cluster is distributed inside @xmath2 , and these fractions are independent of cluster mass . later in the paper , we will use these fractions to construct a way to estimate cluster mass observationally using overdensity and effective volume .",
    "the defined @xmath2 is not sensitive to outliers or the likely departure from spherical symmetry .",
    "figure 2 ( right ) shows @xmath2 for ( proto-)clusters as a function of redshift binned by @xmath26 .",
    "results based on @xmath301 ( solid ) and @xmath307 ( dotted ) cosmologies are presented .",
    "the lines and error bars indicate the medians and @xmath67 scatter ( 15.865th and 84.135th percentile ) for each bin .",
    "we note that the sizes of proto - clusters evolved largely in the past .",
    "as expected , more massive proto - clusters occupied larger comoving volumes .",
    "the effective diameter @xmath83 at @xmath84 for a `` coma '' , `` virgo '' , and `` fornax '' type proto - cluster is expected to be @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 mpc ( comoving ) , respectively . at @xmath88 ,",
    "these sizes increase to be about @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 mpc ( comoving ) .",
    "another way to look at the effective radius @xmath2 is that @xmath2 is very close to the radius of the lagrangian volume of a halo in the simple tophat spherical collapse model .",
    "for example , a typical `` virgo - type '' cluster reaches @xmath70 @xmath11 at @xmath92 ( figure 2 , left ) . assuming this halo is formed under the growth of a tophat density perturbation , the radius of this overdense region is @xmath93 cmpc at @xmath94 , which agrees well with the @xmath2 shown in figure 2 ( right )",
    ". the high @xmath72 and low @xmath73 in the @xmath301 run leads to slightly smaller proto - clusters compared to those in the @xmath307 run at a given redshift .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the slightly higher cluster formation redshifts in @xmath301 .",
    "however , the differences between the two cosmologies are only at a level of few percent .",
    "since this characteristic radius does not contain the entire proto - cluster mass , the overdensity associated with a proto - cluster often extends even farther ( see next subsection ) .      to further demonstrate the large sizes of proto - clusters , as well as the detailed spatial distribution of proto - cluster galaxies as a function of cluster mass and redshift , we perform a stacking analysis of regions centered at proto - clusters .",
    "figure 3 shows the stacked overdensity profiles of three populations of galaxies in three present - day mass bins ( left to right ) at redshifts 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "the effective radius @xmath2 defined in section 3.2 for each subsample and redshift is shown with red lines , showing how the observed density profiles are linked to the more fundamental and relatively model - independent @xmath2 . in all cases ,",
    "the density profile shows a steeper increase toward the center for more biased galaxy populations , exactly as expected .",
    "more massive galaxies ( dotted lines ) result in larger overdensities compared to less massive galaxies ( dashed lines ) .",
    "galaxies selected on the basis of a sfr @xmath95 @xmath11 yr@xmath96 result in the lowest overdensities .",
    "the implications of using these different tracer populations will be discussed below .",
    "the galaxy overdensities that will be presented throughout this paper correspond to the values measured when integrating these density profiles over some given volumes .",
    "although individual structures show certain degrees of non - spherical symmetry and complicated topology associated with cosmic filaments , these averaged profiles are illustrative of the overall large sizes of proto - clusters that can be compared with real observations .",
    "we also note that some galaxies at the outskirts , although associated with the proto - cluster overdensities , will not become cluster members by @xmath1 , but in the future , in appreciation of the fact that cluster formation is an ongoing and inside - out hierarchical process .      the basic physical property determining the fate of structures is the initial density contrast of dark matter as a function of scale shortly after recombination .",
    "this density contrast then evolves under gravitational contraction .",
    "therefore , we expect that the present - day mass of the structures is closely related to the overdensity of dark matter at high redshift averaged over appropriate volumes .",
    "we test this scenario and quantify the correlation and scatter using our large cluster sample and 10,000 random regions drawn from the mr simulation . in the top eight panels of figure 4 , we plot the probability density distribution of dark matter overdensity , @xmath97 for ( proto-)clusters ( black ) and random regions ( gray ) at @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath97 in left and right panels are calculated using tophat cubic windows with 13.4 mpc and 24.1 mpc comoving on a side , respectively .",
    "the probability density distributions here by definition are normalized to @xmath99 when integrating from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , for the bottom panels , we plot the medians and @xmath67 scatter of these distributions for random regions ( gray ) , all ( proto-)clusters ( black ) , and also ( proto-)clusters binned by @xmath26 ( red , green and blue ) as functions of redshift .",
    "the high @xmath97 tails of the random regions may cover parts of nearby cluster or group regions .",
    "it is clear that proto - cluster regions have a higher @xmath97 , and thus they stand out from random fields in overdensity space at all redshifts .",
    "therefore , if we can infer @xmath97 from observables , we should be able to identify proto - clusters long before virialization , and even pin down their approximate @xmath1 masses .",
    "also shown here is that @xmath97 increases with cosmic time for initially overdense regions .",
    "for the random regions , the medians slightly decrease with time and the scatter increase .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of structure formation that `` the rich get richer '' and the voids become emptier . since in the nonlinear regime of structure formation , most of the volume in the universe is underdense , the median @xmath97 of random regions drops .",
    "the relatively large windows we used are motivated by the sizes of proto - clusters presented previously . in smaller windows , @xmath97 are naturally higher since matter is clustered and the center of proto - clusters are close to the local maximum of @xmath97 .",
    "what we really need is to choose an appropriate window to maximize the ability to distinguish the structures of interest . in general",
    ", larger windows are better for more massive clusters and at higher redshifts ( recall figure 2 ) . in figure 4 , 13.4 mpc windows do a better job in separating low - mass proto - clusters from the fields in the @xmath97 distribution at all redshifts .",
    "but the most massive proto - clusters stand out from the field and lower mass clusters by using the larger 24.1 mpc window .",
    "this can be seen in the bottom right panel : the red line is completely separated from the green line without overlap of their scatter .",
    "larger windows make the fractional - scatters of @xmath97 of massive proto - clusters smaller .",
    "the process of galaxy formation occurs in the gravitational bound halos at the local minimums of the potential well .",
    "the overdense nature of proto - cluster regions should manifest itself not only in terms of the continuous matter distributions presented above , but also in the distribution of the individual halos and galaxies already present in that region .",
    "we test this and quantify the scatter by performing the same analysis as in the previous subsection , but now we look at the overdensity of halo number density , @xmath62 .",
    "when counting halo number , the mass of halos needs to be specified .",
    "here we show the case for @xmath102 @xmath11 halos .",
    "figure 5 shows the probability density distribution function of @xmath62 for random regions ( gray ) , all ( proto-)clusters ( black ) , and ( proto-)clusters binned by @xmath26 ( red , green , and blue ) at @xmath103 .",
    "results with @xmath301 ( solid ) and @xmath307 ( dotted ) cosmologies are presented and they are quantitatively similar .",
    "again , data using two different windows are plotted .",
    "similar to figure 4 , proto - cluster regions have high @xmath62 , and thus stand out from random fields .",
    "the most massive ones can be better identified using 25 mpc windows .",
    "the bottom panels of figure 5 clearly show some interesting differences from the @xmath97 evolution of figure 4 .",
    "given the same minimum halo mass at different redshifts , the median values of @xmath62 decrease with cosmic time , even though the structures are growing .",
    "this is because halos with a certain mass at high redshift are more biased than their lower redshift `` counterparts '' , and the real descendants of these high redshift halos evolve to be more massive .",
    "more biased populations are clustered stronger , and thus give higher @xmath62 at higher redshifts .",
    "the choice of the limiting halo mass should be driven by observational practicalities . in order to suppress the statistical noise arising from the discrete nature of halos",
    ", one could , in principle , go to lower mass thresholds to obtain more halos . on the other hand",
    ", this may not always be possible due to the observational constraints ( e.g. , sensitivity of the survey ) .      in the previous sections we showed that proto - clusters can be identified by mass and halo overdensity ( @xmath97 and @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , @xmath97 and @xmath62 are usually not direct observables . in order to bridge the gap between observations and theory , we therefore extract the detailed properties of proto - clusters at the level of direct observables provided by their galaxies as predicted by the sam .",
    "we count the overdensity of galaxies in proto - clusters and random regions , with galaxies selected by different criteria such as stellar mass and sfr .",
    "figure 6 shows the probability density distribution function of @xmath8 for random regions ( gray ) , all ( proto-)clusters ( black ) and ( proto-)clusters binned by @xmath26 ( red , green , and blue ) .",
    "results with @xmath24-body simulations and galaxy models based on @xmath301 ( solid ) and @xmath307 ( dotted ) cosmologies are presented , and they are quantitatively similar . at @xmath37 , the progenitor of a `` coma '' , `` virgo '' , and `` fornax '' type cluster",
    "is expected to have a 15/25 mpc scale galaxy overdensity @xmath104/@xmath105 , @xmath106/@xmath107 , and @xmath108/@xmath109 , respectively , traced by sfr @xmath95 @xmath11 yr@xmath96 galaxies .",
    "remarkably , proto - clusters of different @xmath26 can be separated rather cleanly according to @xmath8 .",
    "this is also true when we use other selection criteria such as stellar mass ( not shown here ) .",
    "again , a large window size is better to identify the most massive proto - clusters .",
    "the threshold of 1 @xmath11 yr@xmath96 chosen here corresponds to the typical limiting sfr achieved by current surveys of ly@xmath20 emitters ( laes ) and lbgs ( slightly more biased ) .",
    "interestingly , the time evolution of the median @xmath8 are relatively flat compared to @xmath97 and @xmath62 shown previously .",
    "this is because the growth of structure and the underlying @xmath97 is counteracted by the decrease of galaxy bias due to selection .",
    "given our constant sfr selection threshold at all redshifts , we are selecting a lower bias population at lower redshifts ( see the galaxy bias in table 1 ) .",
    "this competition is also there for the case of @xmath62 in figure 5 .",
    "if using bright galaxies with @xmath110 @xmath11 , a 15/25 mpc @xmath8 of @xmath111/@xmath112 , @xmath113/@xmath114 , and @xmath115/@xmath116 is expected at @xmath84 for `` coma '' , `` virgo '' , and `` fornax '' type proto - clusters , respectively . in this case ,",
    "@xmath8 increases with redshift due to the steeper evolution of galaxy bias at a fix stellar mass threshold compared to structure growth .    from the underlying mass overdensity @xmath97 , bound units of dark matter",
    "@xmath62 to the final manifestation , @xmath8 , the overdensity@xmath1 structure relation holds remarkably well , giving us great confidence that we can indeed use any of these criteria to find and study the early progenitors of galaxy clusters .",
    "next , we examine how well @xmath8 can be mapped to the underlying @xmath97 by directly plotting @xmath8 vs. @xmath97 ( figure 7 ) . in this plot ,",
    "red dots are regions targeted at the center of proto - clusters .",
    "black dots are random regions that cover @xmath117 volume ( assuming a sphere with radius @xmath2 ) of the most nearby proto - cluster and gray dots are random regions that are consistent with the field .",
    "the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath97 is very tight at all redshifts , thus it is robust to estimate @xmath97 from the measurement of @xmath8 . in order to do this",
    ", one needs to take into account the bias ( defined as @xmath118 ) of the galaxy population that was used to trace the dark matter . in table 1",
    "we give the bias parameters measured for the three populations of galaxies used in our analysis ( i.e. , samples defined as having sfr @xmath95 @xmath11 yr@xmath96 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the bias was assessed at a scale of about 7.5 mpc ( i.e. , half of the size of the window used to calculate the overdensities ) .",
    "we note that although galaxy bias in general is scale dependant , it is fairly constant at scales greater than about 1 mpc , which corresponds to scales beyond a single halo @xcite .",
    ".[tab : galaxy bias]galaxy bias b ( @xmath121 mpc ) as a function of redshift and galaxy type [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     tables 2 , 3 , and 4 further list the @xmath97 , @xmath62 and @xmath8 required to identify a structure as a proto - cluster with @xmath122 and @xmath123 confidence for various redshifts , windows , halo , and galaxy populations .",
    "the corresponding galaxy bias is listed in table 1 .      in order to study the evolution of proto - clusters into clusters , it is extremely important that we compare structures at different redshift by statistically linking structures having a similar @xmath26 .",
    "we thus need to derive reliable methods for estimating the total @xmath1 cluster mass based on the main proto - cluster observables such as their sizes and overdensities . here",
    "we will address this problem in two ways .",
    "first , we will derive the empirical relation between overdensity and @xmath1 cluster mass based on our simulations .",
    "however , because the simulations are not necessarily representative of the true universe , we will also use them simply to test the general concept of estimating the @xmath1 descendant mass of proto - clusters based on methods suggested in literature .",
    "the first method is to use the correlation between overdensity ( of mass , halos , and galaxies ) and the total @xmath26 directly .",
    "figure 9 and 10 show the @xmath26 of our mr sample as functions of @xmath97 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "again , data using two different windows and at @xmath103 are plotted .",
    "the lines and error bars indicate the median and @xmath67 scatter binned by @xmath97 or @xmath8 . as we expect",
    ", large - scale overdensities defined in fixed volume windows increase with the @xmath26 .",
    "this allows us to estimate @xmath26 without further assuming a volume which contains @xmath26 . a large window size , again , provides better measurements of @xmath26 for the most massive proto - clusters . in general , the errors that arise due to the intrinsic scatter are about 0.2 dex in mass for both @xmath97 and @xmath8 ( slightly larger ) .",
    "second , we perform an analysis motivated by the widely used analytic formula first applied to a @xmath124 proto - cluster with estimated @xmath26 of @xmath125 @xmath11 by @xcite : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the true volume containing all of the mass which will be bound and virialized by @xmath1 , and @xmath97 and @xmath59 are the mass overdensity in @xmath127 and the average density , respectively . the @xmath97 is inferred from the observed galaxy overdensity , @xmath8 , and the linear galaxy bias , b ( @xmath128 ) . in principle , complexities introduced by peculiar velocities need to be considered ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "we note that all our numerical results of overdensity and volume presented in this paper refer to the true geometric positions , not considering redshift - space distortions .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in this mass estimation ( equation ( 5 ) ) is the volume , which should be large enough to cover the entire structure .",
    "also , it needs to be shown that the overdensity is large enough for the structure to collapse by @xmath1 .",
    "this is usually done by translating @xmath129 ( inferred from the observed @xmath8 through the bias parameter ) , which is assumed to be described by the spherical collapse model , to the linear regime overdensity ( e.g. , equation ( 18 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and then comparing its growth as a function of redshift with the spherical collapse threshold @xmath130 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these assumptions may introduce systematic and random errors in the mass measurement for any given proto - cluster .    in order to circumvent this series of assumptions and simplifications , we propose a modification based on the insights drawn from simulations . as we proposed in section 3.2 the effective radius ,",
    "@xmath2 can serve as a characteristic size for proto - clusters , as about @xmath131 of the mass in bound halos at the concerned redshift is distributed inside @xmath2 . from equation ( 5 ) , we then have : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the effective volume and @xmath134 is the mass overdensity in @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath136 is a correction factor that relates the mass found within the effective volume to the total mass of the cluster .",
    "it is important to note that our definition of @xmath2 is based only on the mass in bound halos found in the simulation . in reality",
    ", a significant fraction of the mass in the proto - cluster region will be in the form of smaller , unresolved halos as well as uncollapsed dark matter . in order to check the completeness of mass when applying a characteristic volume defined by the effective radius , we plot the enclosed mass @xmath137 in cubic regions centered at the proto - cluster as a function of box size @xmath138 in figure 11 .",
    "what we found is that independent of cluster mass and redshift , a proto - cluster has about @xmath139 of mass ( both bound in halos and unbound in between halos ) inside a cubic region of 2@xmath2 .",
    "this provides a universal correction factor when estimating the proto - cluster mass using equation ( 6 ) of @xmath140 .",
    "figure 12 shows the total mass estimated by our proposed @xmath141 ( equation ( 6 ) ) across the mass and redshift range of interest . as we see @xmath141 works fairly well to reproduce the intrinsic mass @xmath26 .",
    "the errors are in general less than a factor of 2 and the results show no significant bias for different intrinsic cluster masses and at different redshifts .",
    "practically , @xmath141 can be observationally obtained using derived @xmath97 and a volume corresponding to @xmath2 . by definition ( equation ( 4 ) )",
    ", @xmath2 is based on spatial distribution of halo mass , which can be estimated from the observed spatial distribution of galaxies and their inferred halo masses , or by mapping overdensity profiles of proto - cluster galaxies ( see figure 3 ) .      in some of the real observations traced by narrow - band - selected emission line galaxies or samples with photometric redshift , galaxy overdensity",
    "is basically measured in excess of surface density , @xmath142 . in these cases ,",
    "the full width of the redshift range , @xmath143 , for the narrow - band filter or the photometric redshift uncertainty equivalently sets a window with a depth that is often larger in the radial dimension than that assumed by our 15 or 25 mpc cubic windows . as @xmath143 increases",
    ", the projection of the low density proto - cluster outskirts and physically unassociated interlopers diminishes the significance of proto - cluster overdensity , while the projection of overlapping structures can also spuriously boost the observed overdensity .",
    "we demonstrate and quantify this effect by adjusting the depth of the applied windows to the comoving length @xmath144 set by given @xmath143 .",
    "figure 13 shows the @xmath8 as a function of @xmath143 for proto - clusters and 10,000 random regions at @xmath94 traced by galaxies with @xmath145 @xmath11 yr@xmath96 .",
    "the effectively larger windows with increasing @xmath143 smooth the density field , decrease the scatter within each bin , and largely diminish the proto - cluster overdensity .",
    "for example , for star - forming ly@xmath20 emitting galaxies at @xmath94 selected with a typical narrow - band filter ( fwhm @xmath146 @xmath147 , corresponding to a @xmath143 @xmath148 and @xmath149 mpc ) , the surface density of proto - clusters ( @xmath150 ) drops @xmath151 40% from the values calculated with a 15 mpc cubic window . at a @xmath143 @xmath152",
    ", it becomes difficult to distinguish proto - clusters from random fields , except for the most overdense systems . on the other hand ,",
    "if accurate spectroscopic redshifts are obtained , one might still need to correct for the redshift - space distortion due to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of proto - cluster galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if the desired window depth to calculate @xmath8 is relatively small .",
    "the line of sight velocity dispersion of our `` coma- '' , `` virgo- '' , and `` fornax- '' type sample at @xmath22 are at the level of @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 km s@xmath96 , respectively , and they are @xmath156@xmath139 higher at @xmath157 .    in figure 13 , we use shaded bars to mark the different regimes that can be probed by different selection techniques : ( 1 ) a spectroscopic survey in which the redshift uncertainty is set by the velocity distribution of the proto - cluster ( full width of 2@xmath158 and assuming @xmath158 of up to 460 km s@xmath96 ) , ( 2 ) a narrow - band ly@xmath20 survey using a typical narrow - band filter of fwhm @xmath159@xmath160 @xmath147 , and ( 3 ) a photometric redshift survey for which @xmath143 @xmath161 .",
    "it is worth noting that although they will be highly incomplete , techniques with large @xmath143 are still valuable for selecting candidates of proto - cluster .",
    "these candidates will then likely be the progenitors of more massive clusters , as shown in figure 13 .",
    "such structures will be interesting `` by - products '' of upcoming dark energy galaxy surveys .",
    "the search for proto - clusters and the characterization of their main properties offer great challenges and opportunities for the study of cluster formation .",
    "complementary to ongoing observational efforts , our results demonstrate that invaluable insights and quantitative descriptions can also be gained from simulations .",
    "for example , in this paper we have given , for the first time , detailed predictions based on @xmath28 simulated galaxy clusters , while only @xmath162 proto - clusters ( or candidates thereof ) are known from observations .",
    "what have we learned from these simulations predictions ?",
    "as shown in figure 2 , at @xmath37 most cluster progenitors are not yet virialized at the mass scale of present - day clusters ( defined as having a mass @xmath45 @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of extended x - ray emission in observations beyond @xmath16 to date .",
    "however , according to figure 2 , the rarest progenitors of the most massive `` coma - type '' clusters formed as early as @xmath163 , indicating the possibility of x - ray emitting icms yet to be discovered at @xmath37 .",
    "this is also suggested by the hydro - dynamical simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "however , despite the fact that luminous or detectable levels of x - ray emission will be absent for most forming clusters at such high redshifts , we have clearly demonstrated that one can , in principle , already identify the progenitors of massive clusters out to much higher redshifts by simply focusing on their overdensities of galaxies . once identified",
    ", it will be much more efficient to target these structures for faint , diffuse x - ray emission rather than to perform deep blind searches with current x - ray missions .",

    "if we tune our simulations predictions to this particular observational configuration ( not shown here ) and compare them with the observed properties of tn j13381942 , we find that it is most likely the progenitor of a `` virgo - type '' galaxy cluster .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who estimated that @xmath249 @xmath11 based on simple analytical arguments ( e.g. , using equation ( 5 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , from figure 2 we find that this type of proto - cluster is expected to first pass the cluster mass `` threshold '' of @xmath70 m@xmath165 near @xmath250 .    despite the convenience to evaluate @xmath8 within windows of a fixed size , it is important to study the true extension and topology of overdensities .",
    "based on our results presented in section 3.2 and 3.3 , proto - clusters can be significantly larger than assumed in some of the literature which has focused on trying to identify only the core regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although regions exist that show large overdensities on relatively small scales , these will be more prone to projection effects or confusion with the field , and they offer less leverage in determining the true scale of the overdensity .",
    "for example , if a @xmath84 overdense clump of size @xmath251 physical mpc is to be the progenitor of a @xmath4 @xmath11 cluster , it is likely that this clump is surrounded by a significant overdensity out to @xmath252 comoving mpc across with an effective diameter of 2@xmath253 cmpc that encompasses about 40% of the mass . if such a large - scale overdensity is not seen , then it is most likely the progenitor of a much less massive cluster or group . on the other hand ,",
    "extremely large - scale structures with a scale of @xmath254 comoving mpc have also been found at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the central parts of these structures might form massive virialized clusters by @xmath1 , it is unlikely that the collapse of the entire structure will have been completed by @xmath1 .",
    "the present - day mass of the descendant cluster , @xmath26 , is the main physical quantity that should be used to link proto - clusters at high redshift to clusters at low redshift .",
    "as we have shown in this paper , many properties such as the size , virialization redshift and overdensity correlate well with @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 can serve as the principle parameter to classify and characterize structures across the `` proto - cluster zoo '' summarized in table 5 .",
    "galaxy formation processes and time scales are expected to systematically differ along this mass sequence .",
    "for example , cluster red sequences are expected to form earlier in more massive proto - clusters . using the overdensity ",
    "cluster mass ( @xmath8@xmath26 ) relation presented in figures 9 and 10 , as well as the calibrated volume  overdensity approach ( equation ( 6 ) ) with a correction factor @xmath140 , we have shown that several , relatively safe methods exist for estimating @xmath26 with a small intrinsic scatter ( @xmath255 dex , figure 12 ) .",
    "while the most popular method for estimating the total mass of proto - clusters is currently through the use of equation ( 5 ) , this method has a disadvantage in that it requires knowing not only the overdensity , but also the total size of the volume that will have collapsed at @xmath256 .",
    "our first method presented in figures 9 and 10 circumvents this complication by directly calibrating the relation between overdensity and @xmath26 for a fixed window size .",
    "the main disadvantage of course is that this relation is not simulations - independent .",
    "however , as simulations improve , so will the calibration . in the mean time",
    ", it should be possible to use the predictions to establish at least a relative mass scale for proto - clusters found in observations .",
    "it is important to note that a very large number of proto - clusters are needed before we can draw any statistically significant conclusions related to cluster formation from observations , due to the relatively large dispersion in , e.g. , the sizes and overdensities found even for progenitors of clusters having the same mass at @xmath1 . as we have demonstrated in section 3.9 and figure 13",
    ", the uncertainty in the redshift measurements largely diminishes the feasibility to distinguish proto - cluster regions from random fields due to projection and smoothing .",
    "therefore , the ideal tracer galaxies for proto - clusters are not necessarily the most abundant galaxy population in proto - clusters .",
    "emission line galaxies such as laes are good tracers provided that their spectroscopic redshifts are obtained . on the other hand",
    ", it is crucial to get a better handle on the bias of galaxy tracers since the statistical and systematic errors will directly propagate into the derived physical properties of the proto - clusters .",
    "a unique upcoming large area ly@xmath20 survey , the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex , pi : g. hill ) , may generate the first large sample of hundreds to thousands of proto - clusters at @xmath257 .",
    "hetdex is going to perform a blind integral - field unit spectroscopic survey using the upgraded 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope to probe a @xmath15110 gpc@xmath258 volume .",
    "likewise , the hyper suprime - cam and the prime focus spectrograph on the subaru telescope will perform deep , large area imaging and spectroscopic surveys of lbgs and laes allowing the discovery of a large number of proto - clusters and associated galaxies .",
    "meanwhile , the large volumes and precise redshift information of these surveys will largely improve the constraint on galaxy bias .",
    "based on the framework presented in this paper , we will be able to construct the first large statistical samples of proto - clusters from such surveys",
    ". then we will be able to estimate their @xmath1 masses and construct bins corresponding to the progenitors of different present - day mass clusters .",
    "this will finally allow us to systematically compare the properties of clusters and their galaxies at different redshifts and perform a full census of cluster evolution during the `` cosmic noon '' .",
    "in order to pave the way for large , statistical studies of galaxy cluster formation that will be possible with upcoming surveys , we have data - mined the @xmath23cdm mr dark matter and semi - analytic simulations to study the progenitors of 2832 galaxy clusters ( @xmath259 @xmath11 @xmath41 ) and their galaxy populations across cosmic history ( @xmath260 ) . in this first paper",
    ", we present , for the first time , the bulk properties such as the evolution in total mass , size , and overdensity of proto - cluster regions as a function of , e.g. , redshift and present - day cluster mass .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "a proto - cluster can be defined as a large - scale structure which will evolve into a galaxy cluster by @xmath1 , and its @xmath1 mass ( @xmath26 ) is closely related to its main properties at all redshifts ( e.g. , size , dark matter and galaxy overdensity , virialization redshift ) . before the cluster assembly redshift ( defined as the redshift at which the proto - cluster first contains a halo of @xmath70 m@xmath165 ) , the structure is not virialized on a cluster - scale .",
    "the basic observational features of the proto - cluster are ( 1 ) one or a few massive halos and galaxies in the core region of the overdensity , and , more importantly ; ( 2 ) a significant overdensity in mass , halos , and galaxies that extends out to very large comoving scales ( many mpc ) that can already be identified in the large - scale structure as early as @xmath6 .    \\2 . in order to assess when proto - clusters first became clusters , we track the evolution of each cluster s most massive progenitor halo over 13 gyr ( figure 2 , left ) . if we follow the convention and define a galaxy cluster as a bound object with a mass that exceeds @xmath70 @xmath11 , different ( proto-)clusters first pass this threshold in the redshift range from @xmath261 to @xmath71 depending on their final mass .",
    "the typical cluster with a mass similar to that of the virgo cluster passes this threshold at @xmath250 .",
    "however , the most massive clusters ( coma - type clusters or more massive ) reach the threshold mass as early as @xmath262 , indicating that massive , and perhaps x - ray luminous , structures already exist at these early times .",
    "we define an effective radius @xmath2 ( equation ( 4 ) ) that encapsulates @xmath15165% ( 40% ) of the mass in halos ( total mass ) of a proto - cluster .",
    "the proto - cluster effective diameter @xmath83 is in the range @xmath263 mpc at @xmath264 ( figure 2 , right ) .",
    "progenitors of more massive clusters are larger than those of less massive clusters at all redshifts , while the progenitors regions of all clusters were larger at higher redshifts .",
    "we quantify the overdensities associated with proto - clusters in terms of the dark matter , dark matter halos , and galaxies as a function of @xmath26 , redshift , selection window size , and various halo and galaxy selection criteria ( figures 35 ) . by comparing with random regions ,",
    "we derive the conditional probability for an observed structure being a true proto - cluster given a set of observables .",
    "our predictions based on large - scale galaxy overdensities are particularly useful , as we lack the means of directly measuring dark matter mass at high redshifts .",
    "we present two estimators for deriving @xmath26 based on the correlation between @xmath26 and the observed galaxy overdensity ( section 3.8 ) .",
    "we show that the mass of present - day clusters can be `` predicted '' from the observed galaxy overdensity at high redshift with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath265 dex in @xmath26 ( figures 912 ) .",
    "this is promising for future studies as it will allow us to study the evolution of clusters all the way from the proto - cluster phase to their present - day state , properly binned in redshift and ( present - day ) cluster mass .",
    "projection effects arise when the data allows one to only measure galaxy surface overdensities instead of volume overdensities .",
    "although this has a minor effect on the significance of the overdensities measured from narrow - band - selected or spectroscopic samples , it has a major effect on our ability to identify and correctly classify proto - clusters using much cruder selections based on ( broad - band ) color selection ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "we present and discuss a wide range of proto - clusters ( and candidates thereof ) selected from the literature ( see table 5 ) .",
    "in general , these structures with galaxy overdensities of order of a few measured over fields 1020 mpc ( comoving ) in size , are very similar to those predicted by our simulations , indicating that they may indeed represent the earliest stages of cluster formation .",
    "our work demonstrates the feasibility of extending current studies of cluster evolution at low redshift into the epoch at @xmath17 where the clusters and their galaxies were actually forming .",
    "the first large statistical studies of such systems can be undertaken with data from upcoming surveys such as hetdex and subaru / hyper suprime - cam that should generate very large maps of the large - scale structure in three dimensions based on laes and lbgs .",
