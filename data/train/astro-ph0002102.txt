    "the astrophysics data system ( ads ) provides access to the astronomical literature through the world wide web ( www ) .",
    "it is widely used in the astronomical community .",
    "it is accessible to anybody world - wide through a forms based www interface .",
    "a detailed description of the history of the ads is presented in the ads overview article ( @xcite , hereafter overview ) .",
    "the system contains information from many sources ( journals , other data centers , individuals ) .",
    "a detailed description of the data that we get and how they are included in the ads is presented in the ads data article ( @xcite , hereafter data ) .",
    "the incoming data are processed and indexed with custom - built software to take advantage of specialized knowledge of the data and the astronomical context .",
    "a description of this processing is given in the ads architecture article ( @xcite , hereafter architecture ) .",
    "this article describes the development and the current status of the ads abstract service user interface and search engine .",
    "the ads was created as a system to provide access to astronomical data ( @xcite ) . in 1993",
    "the ads started to provide access to a set of abstracts obtained from the nasa / sti ( national aeronautics and space administration / scientific and technical information ) project ( @xcite ) .",
    "the user interface was built with the proprietary software system that the ads used at that time .",
    "the search engine of this first implementation used a commercial database system .",
    "a description of the system at that time is in @xcite .    in 1994 , the world wide web ( www , @xcite ) became widely useful through the ncsa mosaic web browser ( @xcite ) .",
    "the design of the ads abstract service with a clean separation between the user interface and the search engine made it very easy to move the user interface from the proprietary ads system to the www . in february 1994 , a www interface to the ads abstract service was made available publicly .",
    "the www interface to the ads is described by @xcite and @xcite . within one month of the introduction of the www interface ,",
    "the usage of the abstract service tripled , and it has continued to rise ever since ( ) .    with the increased usage of the system due to the easy access through the www , severe limitations of the underlying commercial database system very quickly became apparent .",
    "we soon moved to an implementation of the search engine that was custom - built and tailored to the specific requirements of the data that we used .    in january 1995 we started to provide access to scanned journal articles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the user interface to these scans provided the user with the capability to access the scans in various formats , both for viewing and for printing .    with time , other interfaces to the abstracts and scanned articles were developed to provide other data systems the means to integrate ads data into their system ( @xcite ) .    with the adoption of the www user interface and the development of the custom - built search engine ,",
    "the current version of the ads abstract service was basically in place .",
    "the following sections describe the current status of the different access capabilities ( sections  [ dataretrieval ] and [ cookies ] ) , the search engine ( sections  [ searchengine ] and [ optimization ] ) , access statistics for the ads system ( section  [ accessstats ] ) , and future plans for the ads interface and search engine ( section  [ future ] ) .",
    "the ads services can be accessed through various interfaces .",
    "some of these interfaces use www based forms , others allow direct access to the database and search system through application program interfaces ( apis ) . this section describes the various interfaces and their use , as well as the returned results .        \\a . user interface    the main query forms ( figures  [ queryforma ] ,  [ queryformb ] ,  [ queryformc ] ) provide access to the different abstract databases . these forms are generated on demand by the ads software .",
    "this allows the software to check the user identification through the http ( hypertext transfer protocol ) cookie mechanism ( see section  [ cookies ] ) , so that the software can return a customized query form if one has been defined by the user .",
    "it also adapts parts of the form according to the capabilities of the user s web browser .",
    "the query form allows the user to specify search terms in different fields .",
    "the input parameters in each query field can be combined in different ways , as can the results obtained from the different fields ( figure  [ queryforma ] ) .",
    "the user can specify how the results are combined through settings on the query form ( figure  [ queryformc ] ) .",
    "the combined results can then be filtered according to various criteria ( figure  [ queryformb ] ) .",
    "the database can be queried for author names , astronomical objects names , title words , and words in the abstract text .",
    "references can be selected according to the publication date .",
    "the author name , title , and text fields are case insensitive .",
    "the object field is case sensitive when the iau ( international astronomical union ) circulars ( iauc ) object name database is searched , since the iau object names are case sensitive . in the author and object name fields ,",
    "the form expects one search term per line since the terms can contain blanks . in the title and text fields line breaks are not significant .    [",
    "[ author - name - field ] ] author name field + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the author names are indexed by last name and by a combination of last name and first initial , separated by a comma . to account for differences in the spelling of the same author name ,",
    "the search system contains a list of author names that are spelled differently but are in fact names of the same author .",
    "this allows for automatically retrieving all versions of common spelling differences .",
    "this is useful for instance for german umlaut spelled as muller and mueller , or variations in the transliteration of names from non - english alphabets like cyrillic .",
    "an example of such an entry in the author synonym list is :    .... afanasjev , v afanas'ev , v afanas'iev , v afanasev , v afanasyev , v afans'iev , v afansev , v ....    without this synonym replacement capability , author searches would obviously be much less effective . on user request",
    "we also include name changes ( e.g. due to marriage ) in the author synonym list .",
    "combinations of search results within the author field use `` or '' , `` and '' , or simple logic ( see below ) , depending on user selection .",
    "author names are quite often spelled differently in different publications .",
    "first names are sometimes spelled out , sometimes only first initials are given , and sometimes middle initials are left out .",
    "this makes it impossible to index all different spellings of a name together automatically .    to handle these different requirements ,",
    "author names are indexed three times , once with the last name only , once with the last name and first initial , and once with the complete name as it is specified in the article .    to access these different indexes ,",
    "we provide two user interfaces for author queries .",
    "the regular user interface allows the user to search for either a last name or a last name combined with the first initial .",
    "this allows for fairly discriminating author searches .",
    "it is a compromise between the need to discriminate between different authors , and the need to find all instances of a given author .",
    "it identifies all different versions of a given author quite reliably , but it indexes together different authors with the same first initial . for cases where this search method is not discriminating enough , we provide a second user interface to the index of the full names , which does not attempt to index different spellings of the same author together .",
    "when the user selects `` exact author search '' and specifies an author s last name or last name and first initial , a form is returned with all distinct full author names that match the specified name .",
    "the user then selects all the different spellings of the desired name and queries the database for articles that contain any one of these different versions of an author s name .",
    "for instance specifying :    .... eichhorn , g ....    in the exact author name form returns the list :    .... eichhorn , g. eichhorn , gerhard eichhorn , guenther eichhorn , gunther ....    selecting the first , third , and fourth author name from that list will return all articles by the first author of this article",
    ". any articles by the second author containing only the first initial will also be returned , but this is unavoidable .    [",
    "[ object - name - field ] ] object name field + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this field allows the user to query different databases for references with different astronomical objects .",
    "the databases that provide object information are : simbad ( set of identifications , measurements and bibliographies for astronomical data ) at the centre des donnes astronomique de strasbourg ( cds ) , france ( @xcite ) ; the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) at the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) , jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , pasadena , ca ( @xcite ) ; the iau circulars ( iauc ) and the minor planet electronic circulars ( mpec ) , both provided by the central bureau for astronomical telegrams ( cbat ) at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics in cambridge , ma ( @xcite ) ; and a database with objects from publications from the lunar and planetary institute ( lpi ) in houston ( mainly lunar sample numbers and meteorite names ) .",
    "the user can select which of these databases should be queried .",
    "if more than one database is searched , the results of these queries are merged .",
    "the lpi database does not have any entries in common with the other databases .",
    "the simbad , ned , and iauc databases sometimes have information about the same objects .    [ [ title - and - abstract - text - fields ] ] title and abstract text fields + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    these fields query for words in the titles of articles or books , and in the abstracts of articles or descriptions of books respectively .",
    "the words from the title of each reference are also indexed in the text field so they will be found through either a title or a text search . before querying the database the input in these fields is processed as follows :    \\1 .",
    "apply translation rules .",
    "this step merges common expressions into a single word so that they are searched as one expression .",
    "regular expression matching is used to convert the input into a standard format that is used to search the database .",
    "for instance _",
    "m 31 _ ( with a space ) is translated to _ m31 _ ( without a space ) for searching as one search term . in order to make this general translation , a regular expression matching and substitution",
    "is performed that translates all instances of an ` m ' followed by one or more spaces or a hyphen followed by a number into ` m ' directly followed by the number .",
    "other translation rules include the conversion of _ ngc 1234 _ to _ ngc1234 _ , contractions of _ t tauri , be star , shoemaker levy _ , and several others ( see architecture ) .",
    "remove punctuation . in this step",
    "all non - alphanumeric characters are removed , unless they are significant ( for instance symbols used in the simple logic ( see below ) , ` + ' and `  ' before numbers , or ` . ' within numbers ) .",
    "translate to uppercase .",
    "all information in the index files is in uppercase , except for object names from the iau circulars .",
    "remove kill words .",
    "this step removes all non - significant words .",
    "this includes words like ` and ' , ` although ' , ` available ' , etc ( for more details see architecture ) .    in the title and text fields , searching for phrases",
    "can be specified by enclosing several words in either single or double quotes , or concatenating them with periods ( ` . ' ) or hyphens ( `  ' ) .",
    "all these accomplish the same goal of searching the database for references that contain specified sequences of words .",
    "the database is indexed for two - word phrases in addition to single words .",
    "phrases with more than two words are treated as a search for sets of two - word phrases containing the first and second word in the first phrase , the second and third word in the second phrase , etc .",
    "searching    after the search terms are pre - processed , the databases of the different fields are searched for the resulting list of words , the results are combined according to the selected combination rules , and the resulting score is calculated according to the selected scoring criteria .",
    "these combination rules provide the means for improving the selectivity of a query .    [ [ search - word - selection ] ] search word selection + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the database is searched for the specified words as well as for words that are synonymous with the specified term .",
    "one crucial part to successful searches in a free text search system is the ability to not only find words exactly as specified , but also similar words .",
    "this starts with simply finding singular and plural forms of a word , but then needs to be extended to different words with the same meaning in the normal usage of words in a particular field of science . in astronomy for instance `` spectrograph '' and `` spectroscope ''",
    "have basically the same meaning and both need to be found when one of these words is specified in the query .",
    "even further reaching , more discipline - specific synonyms are necessary for efficient searches such as `` metallicity '' and `` abundance '' which have the same meaning in astronomical word usage . in order to exhaustively search the database for a given term , it is important to search for all synonyms of a given word .",
    "the list of synonyms was developed manually by going through the list of words in the database and grouping them according to similar meanings .",
    "this synonym list is a very important part of the ads search system and is constantly being improved ( see architecture ) .",
    "the list of synonyms also contains non - english words associated with their english translations .",
    "these words came from non - english reference titles that we included in the database .",
    "this allows searches with either the english or non - english words to find references with either the english word or the non - english translation .",
    "we are in the process of extending this capability by including translations of most of the words in our database into several languages ( german , french , italian , spanish ) .",
    "this will allow our users to phrase queries in any of these languages .",
    "we expect to complete this project sometime in 2000 .",
    "by default a search will return references that contain the search word or any of its synonyms .",
    "the user can choose to disable this feature if for some reason a specific word needs to be found .",
    "the synonym replacement can be turned off completely for a field in the `` settings '' section of the query form .",
    "this can be used to find a rare word that is a synonym of a much more frequent word , for instance if you want to look for references to `` dateline '' , which is a synonym to `` date '' .",
    "synonym replacement can also be enabled or disabled for individual words by prefixing a word with ` = ' to force an exact match without synonym replacement . when synonym replacement is disabled for a field , it can be turned on for a particular word by prefixing it with ` # ' .    [",

    "combination by ` or ' : the resulting list contains all references that contain at least one of the search terms",
    "combination by ` and ' : the resulting list has only references that contain every one of the search terms .",
    "combination by simple logic : the default combination in this logic is by ` or ' .",
    "individual terms can be either required for selection by prefixing them with a ` + ' , or can be selected against by prefixing them with a `  ' . in the latter case",
    "only references that do not contain the search term are returned .",
    "if any of the terms in the search is prefixed by a ` + ' , any other word without a prefix does not influence the resulting list of references .",
    "however , the final score ( see below ) for each reference will depend on whether the other search terms are present .",
    "combination by full boolean logic : in this setting , the user specifies a boolean expression containing the search terms and the boolean operators ` and ' , ` or ' , and ` not ' , as well as parentheses for grouping .",
    "a boolean expression could for instance look like :    ( pulsar or `` neutron star '' ) and ( `` red shift '' distance ) and not 1987a    this expression searches for references that contain either the word pulsar or the phrase `` neutron star '' and either the phrase `` red shift '' or the word distance ( `` or '' being the default ) , but not the word 1987a .",

    "this score is calculated according to how many of the search items were matched .",
    "the user has the choice between two scoring algorithms :    .... 1 .",
    "proportional scoring 2 .   weighted scoring ....",
    "these scoring algorithms have been analyzed by @xcite .    in proportional scoring , the score is directly proportional to the number of terms found in the reference . in weighted scoring ,",
    "the score is proportional to the inverse logarithm of the frequency of the matched word .",
    "this weighting gives higher scores for words that are less frequent in the database and therefore presumably more important indicators of the relevance of a match . in the settings section of the query form",
    "the user can select which type of scoring should be used for each query field separately .",
    "the default setting for title and text searches is the weighted scoring . for author searches proportional",
    "scoring is the default .",
    "once the score for each query field is calculated , the scores are normalized so that a reference that matches all words in a field receives a score of 1 .    the normalized scores from the different fields are then combined to calculate a total score .",
    "again the result is normalized so that a reference that matches all words in each query field has a score of 1 .",
    "the user can influence this combining of scores from the different search fields by assigning weights to the different fields .",
    "this allows the user to put more emphasis in the selection process on , for instance , the object field by assigning a higher weight to that field .",
    "another use of the weight field is to select against a field .",
    "for instance specifying an object name and an author name and selecting a negative weight to the author field will select articles about that object that were _ not _ written by the specified author .",
    "the relative weights for the different search fields can be set by the user .",
    "the ads provides default weights as follows :    .... authors : 1.0 objects : 1.0 title :    0.3 text :     3.0 ....    these default weights were determined on theoretical grounds , combined with trial and error experimentation .",

    "sometimes it is important for our users to be able to see what words are in a particular synonym group to properly interpret the search results .",
    "another question that is asked is what words are in the database and how often .",
    "the list query page ( linked to the words `` authors '' , `` title words '' , and `` text words '' above the corresponding entry fields on the main query form ) allows the user to find synonym groups and words in the database .",

    "its position is contained in the structure of the last reference identifier .",
    "this auxiliary block is merged with the original one .",
    "the identifier for each reference is the position of the bibliographic code for that reference in the list of all bibliographic codes .",
    "this system saves one lookup of the identifier in a list of identifiers , since the number can be used directly as an index in the array of bibliographic codes .",
    "as mentioned above , the index files contain information about two blocks of data , the data for the individual word and for the synonym group to which this word belongs .",
    "when a search with synonym lookup enabled is requested , the block of data for the whole synonym group is used , otherwise the data for only the individual word is returned .",
    "all the processing that enables these two types of searches is done during indexing time , therefore the speeds for both searches are similar .    even though our synonym list is quite extensive ( see architecture ) our users will sometimes use words that are not in the database or the synonym list . in these cases",
    "the search software uses a stemming algorithm from the unix utility ispell to find the stem of the search word and the searches for the word stem .",
    "the indexing software has indexed the stems of all words in the database together with their original words ( see architecture ) .",
    "this word stemming is done as a last resort if no regular match has been found in an attempt to find any relevant references .      in order to be able to search for families of words",
    ", a limited wildcard capability is available .",
    "two wildcard characters are defined : the question mark ` ? '",
    "is used to specify a single wildcard character and the asterisk ` * ' is used to specify zero or more wildcard characters .",
    "the ` ? ' can be used anywhere in a word .",
    "for instance a search for _ m1 ?",
    "_ will find all messier objects between m10 and m19 .",

    "adsorb_.    the asterisk can only be used at the beginning or at the end of a word . for instance _ 3c * _ searches for all 3c objects .",
    "_ sorb _ searches for words that end in _ sorb _ like absorb , desorb , etc .",
    "when synonym replacement is on , all their synonyms ( e.g. absorption ) will be found as well .",
    "the ` ? ' and the ` * ' can be combined in the same search string .        as mentioned above",
    ", the user can select between four types of combination methods : `` or '' , `` and '' , simple logic , and full boolean logic .",
    "for the first three cases , the references for all search terms are retrieved and sorted first .",
    "the reference lists are then merged by going through the sorted reference lists sequentially and synchronously and selecting references according to the chosen logic .",
    "the search algorithm for the full boolean logic is different .",
    "the boolean query is parsed from left to right . for each search term",
    "a function is called that finds the references for this term .",
    "a search term is either a search word , a phrase , or an expression enclosed in parentheses . if the search term contains other terms ( if it is enclosed in parentheses )",
    ", the parsing function is called recursively .",
    "the next step is to determine the boolean operator that follows the search term , and then to evaluate the next search term after the operator .",
    "once the reference lists for the two terms and the combining operator are determined , the two lists are combined according to the operator .",
    "this new list is then used as the first term of the next expression .",
    "if the boolean operator is ` or ' , the combining of the lists is deferred , and the next operator and search term are evaluated .",
    "this ensures the correct precedence of ` or ' and ` and ' operators .    the ` not ' operator is implemented by getting the reference list for the term , making a copy of all references in the database , and then removing the references from the search term from the complete list",
    "this yields a very large list of references .",
    "if the first search term in a boolean expression is a ` not ' term , the search will take very long , because this large list has to be propagated through all the subsequent parsing of the boolean expression .",
    "care should therefore be taken to put a ` not ' term to the right of at least one other term , since processing is done left to right .",
    "as an example , figure  [ pseudocode ] shows the processing of the boolean expression mentioned in section  [ dataretrieval ] :    .... ( pulsar or `` neutron star '' ) and     ( `` red shift '' distance ) and     not 1987a ....      in addition to the information about the references for each word , the index file also contains its frequency in the database .",
    "the frequency is already pre - calculated as int(10000/(log(frequency ) ) ) during indexing ( see architecture ) .",
    "this saves considerable time during execution of the search engine since all server calculations can be done as integer computations , no floating point operations are necessary . during the first part of the search , this frequency is attached to each retrieved reference . in the next step ,",
    "the retrieved references are combined according to the selected combination logic for that field .    for ` or ' combination logic , the lists retrieved for each word are merged and uniqued . as described in section  [ optimization ] , this is done by going through the sorted reference lists synchronously and adding each new reference to the output list .",
    "the score for that reference is determined by adding up the frequencies from each of the lists for weighted scoring , or by setting a score equal to the number of matched words for proportional scoring .    for ` and ' combination logic , only references that appear in every one of the lists are selected . each of these references receives a score of 1 .    for simple logic and full boolean logic ,",
    "the score for the returned references is determined only from the search terms that were combined with ` or ' .",
    "all words that have mandatory selection criteria ( prefixed by ` + ' or `  ' in simple logic , and combined with ` and ' or ` not ' in full boolean logic ) do not affect the final score .",
    "after the posix threads for each search field are started , the main program waits for all threads to complete the search .",
    "when all searches are completed the search engine combines the results of the different searches according to the selected settings .",
    "if for instance one field was selected as required for selection in the settings section of the query form , only references that were found in the search for that field will be in the final reference list .",
    "the combined list is then uniqued and sorted by score .",
    "the resulting list of references is passed back to the user interface software .",
    "if the user did not specify any search terms , a date range has to be selected .",
    "the software queries the database for all references in the selected date range and uses this list for further processing , e.g. filtering ( see section  [ filters ] ) .      the score for each reference in the final results list",
    "is determined by adding the scores from each list multiplied by the user specified weight for each field and then normalizing the score such that a reference that matches all search terms from all fields receives a score of 1 .",
    "after the search is completed according to the specified search words and the settings that control the combination logic and the scoring algorithms , the resulting list of references can be filtered according to several criteria . during the design of the software a decision had to be made whether to filter the results while selecting the references or after completing the search .",
    "the first approach has the advantage that the combining of the selected references will be faster because fewer references need to be combined .",
    "the second approach has the advantage that the first selection is faster .",
    "we chose the second approach because , except for selecting by publication date , only a small number of queries use filtering ( see section  [ accessstats ] ) .",
    "because of that , filtering by publication date is done during selection of the references , while the other filtering is done after the search is completed .",
    "references can be filtered by five criteria :    .... 1 .",
    "entry date in the data base 2",
    ".   minimum score 3 .",
    "journal 4 .",
    "available links 5 .",
    "group membership ....    \\1 .",
    "entry date and minimum score .",
    "these two filters can be used to query the database automatically on a regular basis for new information that is relevant to a selected topic .",

    ", the query will retrieve all references that fit the query and that were entered within the last seven days .",
    "the minimum score can be used to limit the returned number of references to only the ones that are really relevant .",

    "if the last option is selected , the user can specify one or more journal abbreviations ( e.g. apj , aj ( astronomical journal ) ) that should be selected .",
    "more than one abbreviation can be specified by separating them with semicolons or blanks .",
    "the filter for journals can also include the volume number ( but not the page number ) .",
    "the journal abbreviation is compared with the bibliographic codes over the length of the specified abbreviation .",
    "for instance if the user specifies _ apj _ , the system selects all articles published in the apj , apj supplement and apj letters . _",

    "available links .",
    "this filter allows the user to select references that have specific other information available .",
    "the returned references can be filtered for instance to include only references that have data links or scanned articles available .",
    "as an example , a user needs to find on - line data about a particular object .",
    "a search for that object in the object field and a filter for references with on - line data returns all articles about that object that link to on - line data .",
    "\\5 . groups .",
    "we provide the capability to build a reference collection for a specific subset of references .",
    "this can be either articles written by members of a particular research institute or about a particular subject .",
    "currently there are 5 groups in the ads .",
    "we encourage larger institutes or groups to compile a list of their references and send it to us to be included in the list of groups .",
    "the search engine is entirely custom - built software . as mentioned in the introduction , the first version of the abstract service used commercial database software . because of too many restrictions and serious performance problems , a custom - designed system was developed .",
    "the main design goal was to make the search engine as fast as possible .",
    "the most important feature that helped speed up the system was the use of permanent shared memory segments for the search index tables . in order to make searching fast , these index tables need to be in random access memory . since",
    "they are tens of megabytes long , they can not be loaded for each search .",
    "the use of permanent shared memory segments allows the system to have all the index tables in memory all the time .",
    "they are loaded during system boot .",
    "when a search engine is started , it attaches to the shared segments and has the data available immediately without any loading delays .",
    "the shared segments are attached as read - only , so even if the search engine has serious bugs , it can not compromise the integrity of the shared segments . using shared segments with the custom - built software",
    "improved the speed of a search by a factor of 2  20 , depending on the type of search .",
    "access to the list files ( see section  [ searchalgorithm ] ) was optimized too . these files can not be loaded into memory since they are too large ( each is over one hundred megabytes in size ) . to optimize access to these files ,",
    "they are memory mapped when they are accessed for the first time . from then on they can be accessed as if they were arrays in memory .",
    "the data blocks specified in the index tables can be accessed directly .",
    "access is still from file , but it is handled through the paging in the operating system , rather than through the regular i / o system , which is much more efficient .    once the search engine was completed and worked as designed , it was further optimized by profiling the complete search engine and then optimizing the modules that used significant amounts of time .",
    "further analysis of the performance of the search engine revealed instances where operations were done for each search that could be done during indexing of the data and during loading of the shared segments .",
    "overall these optimizations resulted in speed improvements of a factor of more than 10 over the performance of the first custom - built version .",
    "these optimizations were crucial for the acceptance of the ads search system by the users .    in order to further speed up the execution",
    ", the search engine uses posix threads to exploit the inherent parallel nature of the search task .",
    "the search for each field , and in the case of the object field for each database , is handled by a separate posix thread .",
    "these threads execute in parallel , which can provide speedups in our multiprocessor server . even for single processor systems",
    "this will provide a decrease in search time , since each thread sometimes during its execution needs to wait for i / o to complete . during these times",
    "other threads can execute and therefore decrease the overall execution time of a search .",
    "another important part of the optimization was the decision on how to structure the index and list files .",
    "the index files contain the word frequency information that is used to calculate scores for the weighted scoring ( see section  [ abstracts]c ) .",
    "the score for a matching reference is calculated from the inverse logarithm of the frequency of the word in the database .",
    "this requires time consuming floating point calculations . to avoid these calculations during the searches ,",
    "the floating point arithmetic is done at indexing time .",
    "the index file contains the inverse log of the word frequency multiplied by a normalization factor of 10,000 .",
    "this allows all subsequent calculations to be done in integer arithmetic , which is considerably faster than floating point calculations .",
    "another optimization was to pre - compile the translation rules ( see section  [ abstracts ] ) .",
    "these translation rules are pre - compiled and stored in a shared memory segment to which the search process attaches .",
    "this allows for faster execution of these pattern matching routines .",
    "overall , these optimizations improved the speed of the searches by two orders of magnitude between the original design using a commercial database and the current software .",
    "the ads software keeps extensive logs about the use of the search and access software . in this section ,",
    "usage statistics for the search software and for access patterns to the article service are reported .",
    "if not otherwise indicated , the statistics in this section are for the one - year period from 1 april 1998 through 31 mar 1999 .",
    "the ads is accessed by users from many different countries . in the one - year period of this section",
    "the ads was accessed by 127,000 different users , using 100,000 different hosts from 112 different countries .",
    "an individual user is defined as having a unique cookie ( see section  [ cookies ] ) .",
    "users without cookies are distinguished by the hostnames from which the requests came .",
    "this may overestimate the number of users , since some users may have more than one cookie , for instance when accessing the ads from home .",
    "the number of different hosts is a lower limit of the number of users .",
    "many hosts are used by multiple users , so the real number is certainly considerably higher than that .",
    "the development of the number of users and queries over the life of the ads is described in overview .",
    "this section describes some more detailed investigations of the access statistics .",
    "the total number of users at first comes as quite a surprise .",
    "the number of working astronomers in the world is probably between 10,000 and 20,000 .",
    "the number of ads users is much larger than that .",
    "this is probably due to several factors .",
    "first , there are certainly many accidental users .",
    "they somehow find our search page through some link , execute a query to see what they get back , and then never come back because it is of no interest to them .",
    "other possible users are media people .",
    "there are certainly many reporters occasionally looking up something in astronomy .",
    "i have spoken with several of them that use the ads occasionally for that .",
    "another group of users are amateur astronomers .",
    "the ads was described in sky & telescope by a few years ago .",
    "this has certainly made amateur astronomers aware of this resource .",
    "the number of amateur astronomers world - wide is certainly in the millions , so they comprise a potentially large number of users .",
    "another large group of users visits the ads through links from other web sites .",
    "one particularly popular one is nasa s image of the day , which frequently includes links to abstracts or articles in the ads .",
    "since this nasa page is visited by millions of people , a large number of them will access the ads through these links .",
    "the use of the ads in different countries depends on several factors .",
    "one of these is certainly the population of the country .",
    "figure  [ qupop ] shows the number of queries per capita as a function of the population of the country ( @xcite ) .",
    "there seems to be an upper limit of about 0.1  0.2 queries per person per year .",
    "the one exception is the vatican with almost 3 queries per person per year .",
    "this is understandable since the vatican has an active astronomy program , which generates a large number of queries for a small population .",
    "another factor for querying the ads is the funding available for astronomy in a country , and the available infrastructure to do astronomical research .",
    "figure  [ gdprefs ] shows the number of references retrieved per capita as a function of the gross domestic product ( gdp , @xcite ) of the country .",
    "the symbols are the internet codes for each country .",
    "the highly industrialized countries cluster in the upper right part of the plot ( area 1 ) .",
    "a closeup of this region is shown in figure  [ gdprefsclose ] .",
    "other clusters are the countries of the former soviet union ( area 2 ) , and central and south american countries ( area 3 ) .",
    "the high number of references retrieved per capita combined with the lower gdp per capita of the former soviet union is probably due to a recent decline in gdp , but a still existing infrastructure for astronomical research .",
    "the ads is used 24 hours per day .",
    "the distribution of queries throughout the day is shown in figure  [ 24hqu ] .",
    "this figure shows the number of queries at the two largest mirror sites , as well as the queries at the main ads site .",
    "the usage distribution data are for the time period from 1 november 1998 to 31 march 1999 , not the full year , to avoid complications due to different periods where daylight savings time is in effect .",
    "the queries at the main site are separated into us users and non - us users on the basis of their internet hostnames .",
    "all the individual curves show a distinct two - peaked basic shape , with additional smaller peaks in some cases .",
    "this distribution of queries over the day shows the usage throughout a workday , with a small minimum during lunch hour .",
    "the sao - us distribution does not show a real minimum between the two peaks , presumably because of the distribution of us researchers over three time zones .",
    "there are three features in this figure that deserve special notice .",
    "the first is that the shape of the accesses to the ads mirror in france is the same as the shape of the non - us access to the sao site .",
    "this indicates that the large majority of the non - us use on the sao site is from european users .",
    "this non - us usage is about 50% higher than the total usage of the ads mirror site at the cds in france .",
    "the reason for this is most probably the fact that the connectivity within europe is not yet very good . we know that for instance that our users in england and sweden have better access to the main ads site in the usa than to our mirror site in france .",
    "the same is true for other parts of europe .",
    "another reason for the use of the usa site by european users is the fact that our european mirror sites do not yet have the complete set of scanned articles on - line .",
    "this forces some users to access the main ads site in order to retrieve scanned articles .",
    "second , there is a slight peak in the distribution of queries to the nao mirror in japan around 21:00 utc ( universal time coordinated , formerly greenwich mean time ) .",
    "this is probably due to us west coast users using the japanese mirror site instead of the us site .",
    "the access to japan is frequently very fast and response times from japan may be better than from sao during peak traffic times .",
    "third , there is a distinct peak in the sao - us usage at 9:00 utc .",
    "this feature was so unusual that we tracked down the reason for it .",
    "it turns out that one of our users has set up web pages that include about 200 links to ads abstracts .",
    "he had set up a link verifier that every night at 9:00 utc checked all the links on his pages .",
    "this meant that the link verifier executed 200 queries every night at the same time , which showed up in this evaluation of our access statistics .",
    "the following section shows statistics of how our users use the different capabilities of the ads query system .",
    "figure  [ fieldhist ] shows a histogram of the relative usage of the different search fields ( authors , objects , title , text ) .",
    "it shows clearly that the majority of queries are queries by author name ( 66% ) .",
    "object names are used in fewer than 5% of the queries .",
    "the title field is used in about 21% of the queries , and the text field in 26% .",
    "queries that use more than one field make up about 18% of the total .",
    "this usage pattern justifies for instance including tables of contents ( tocs ) in the database that do not have abstracts for searching .",
    "since a large part of the usage is through author and title queries , such toc entries will still be found .",
    "figure  [ numsearchitems ] shows the number of queries as a function of the number of query items in each input field .",
    "the query frequency generally decreases exponentially with increasing number of search terms . for title and text queries ,",
    "the frequency is approximately constant up to 3 query words , before the frequency starts to decrease . for abstract queries",
    "there is a significant increase in frequency of queries with more than 20 query words , for title queries there is a similar increase for queries with more than about 8 query words .",
    "this is due to queries generated through the query feedback mechanism which allows the user to use a given abstract and its title as a new query .",
    "figures  [ settingsuse1 ] and [ settingsuse2 ] show the usage of non - default query settings ( see section  [ searchalgorithm ] ) .",
    "the default settings were chosen to suffice for most queries .",
    "figure  [ settingsuse1 ] shows the percentage of non - default settings for the different settings and query fields available .",
    "it shows that 29% of author queries , 78% of title queries , and 85% of text queries use non - default settings .",
    "this was at first disappointing , because it suggested that the default settings might not be a reasonable selection of settings .",
    "the two main settings that were non - default were combining words with `` and '' ( see section  [ abstracts].b.ii ) , and disabled weighted scoring ( see section  [ abstracts].c ) . on closer examination of the statistics it turns out that the straight weighting settings come from mainly two systems , the nasa techreports and the international society for optical engineering ( spie ) .",
    "both of these systems use our perl scripts ( see section  [ perlaccess ] ) to access the ads database .",
    "they do not set our normal default settings during these queries .",
    "figure  [ settingsuse2 ] shows the non - default settings for all queries that did not come from either of these two servers .",
    "there is still a small percentage of queries that use straight weighting , probably mostly due to other systems that use our perl script interface routines .",
    "the one remaining non - default setting that is used frequently is the combination of words with `` and '' .",
    "we believe that the `` or '' combination as default is more useful since it returns more information .",
    "the beginning of the list of returned references is the same , regardless of whether `` and '' or `` or '' combination is selected , since references that match all words are sorted to the beginning of the list . when `` or '' combination is selected , partial matches will be returned after the ones with perfect matches .",
    "this is desirable since there may be relevant references that for some reason do not match all query words .",
    "the other selecting mechanism that is available is the filtering of references according to what other information is available for a reference .",
    "the usage of the filtering is shown in table  [ filteruse ] . about 10% of the total queries",
    "use the filter option .",
    "almost all of these filter by journal or select refereed journals only .",
    "the sum of the numbers for required data types adds up to more than the number for `` required data '' , since more than one data type can be selected .",

    "we always welcome suggestions for improvements and usually implement reasonable suggestions very quickly ( within days or a few weeks ) . because of this rapid implementation of new features we have hardly any backlog of improvements that we want to implement .",
    "there are currently two larger projects that we are investigating .",
    "we plan to convert all our scanned articles into electronic text through optical character recognition ( ocr ) . in order to be able to search full text articles we will need to develop new search algorithms .",
    "our current search system depends on the abstracts being of fairly uniform length .",
    "this caused some problems at one time when we included sets of data with abstracts that were 4 - 5 times as long as our regular abstracts .",
    "these long abstracts would be found disproportionally often in searches with many query words ( for instance in query feedback searches ) , since they generally matched more words .",
    "we had to reduce the sizes of these abstracts in order to make the searching work consistently with these data sets .",
    "ocrd full text will require new search algorithms to make the search work at all .",
    "we currently estimate that the implementation of the full text search capability will take at least 2 years .",
    "the scanned articles frequently contain plots of data . for most of these plots",
    "the numerical data are not available .",
    "we plan to develop an interface that will allow our users to select a plot , display it at high resolution , and digitize the points in the plot by clicking on them .",
    "this will allow our users to convert plots into data tables with as much precision as is available on the printed pages . at this time",
    "we do not know how long it will take us to implement this new capability .",
    "we are currently investigating several new data compression schemes that would considerably reduce the size of our scanned articles .",
    "this could considerably improve the utility of the ads article service , especially on slow links .",
    "we plan to be quite conservative in our approach to this , since we do not want to be locked into proprietary compression algorithms that could be expensive to utilize . at this point",
    "we do not have any time frame in which this might be accomplished .",
    "the ads abstract service has been instrumental in changing the way astronomers search and access the literature .",
    "one of the reasons for the immediate acceptance of the ads by the astronomical community when the www based version became available was the ease of use of the interface .",
    "it provided access to many advanced features , while still making it extremely easy to execute simple queries .",
    "most of the use is for simple queries , but a significant number of queries utilize the more sophisticated capabilities .    the search engine that provides this access was crucial to the success of the ads as well .",
    "the most important aspects of a search engine are its speed and its flexibility to accommodate special features .",
    "the custom - designed software of the ads search engine proved that at least in some instances a custom design has considerable advantage over a general purpose system .",
    "the search speed that we were able to achieve and the flexibility of the custom design that allows us to quickly adapt to our users needs have justified the efforts of developing a system from scratch that is tailored to the specific data set .    the ads had 31,533 users issue 780,711 queries and retrieve 15,238,646 references , 615,181 abstracts , and 1,119,122 scanned pages in november , 1999 . since the start of the ads we have served 311,594.261 references and 17,146,370 scanned article pages .",
    "these numbers speak for them self about the success of the ads .",
    "funding for this project has been provided by nasa under nasa grant ncc5 - 189 ."
