    "the nuclear force is the heart of nuclear physics . yet , in spite of 70 years of research , we do not fully understand it .",
    "i will critically review some recent advances ( sec .  2 ) and then point out future directions ( sec .",
    "3 ) that may have the potential to finally crack the case  in the course of the new millennium .",
    "i define ` recent progress ' as the progress of the past decade ( i.  e. , the 1990 s ) . in this decade",
    ", we have seen advances in @xmath0 phenomenology as well as theory . in this section , i will focus on phenomenology .",
    "more fundamental issues are addressed in sec .",
    "3 .      in spite of the huge @xmath0 database available today ,",
    "conventional phase shift analyses are by no means perfect .",
    "for example , the phase shift solutions obtained by bugg  @xcite or the vpi group  @xcite typically have a @xmath1datum of about 1.4 , for the energy range 0425 mev .",
    "this may be due to inconsistencies in the data as well as deficiencies in the constraints applied in the analysis . in any case",
    ", it is a matter of fact that within the conventional phase shifts analysis , in which the lower partial waves are essentially unconstrained , a better fit can not be achieved .",
    "about two decades ago , the nijmegen group embarked on a program to substantially improve @xmath0 phase shift analysis . to achieve their goal ,",
    "the nijmegen group took two decisive measures  @xcite .",
    "first , they ` pruned ' the data base ; i.e. , they scanned very critically the world @xmath0 data base ( all data in the energy range between zero and 350 mev of laboratory energy published in a regular physics journal between january 1955 and december 1992 ) and eliminated all data that had either an improbably high @xmath2 ( off by more than three standard deviations ) or an improbably low @xmath2 ; of the 2078 world @xmath3 data below 350 mev 1787 survived the scan , and of the 3446 @xmath4 data 2514 survived .",
    "secondly , they introduced sophisticated , semi - phenomenological model assumptions into the analysis .",
    "namely , for each of the lower partial waves ( @xmath5 ) a different energy - dependent potential is adjusted to constrain the energy - dependent analysis .",
    "phase shifts are obtained using these potentials in a schroedinger equation . from these phase shifts the predictions for the observables",
    "are calculated including the @xmath2 for the fit of the experimental data .",
    "this @xmath2 is then minimized as a function of the parameters of the partial - wave potentials .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the nijmegen analysis is a _ potential analysis _ ; the final phase shifts are the ones predicted by the ` optimized ' partial - wave potentials which involve 39 parameters .    in the combined @xmath3 and @xmath4 analysis  @xcite , the fit for 1787 @xmath3 data and 2514 @xmath4 data below 350 mev results in the ` perfect ' @xmath1datum = 0.99 _ for the @xmath0 database available in 1993 .",
    "_ since then , many @xmath3 data of high precision have been taken ( particularly at iucf  @xcite ) .",
    "today the @xmath3 database consists of 2932 data ( below 350 mev ) for which the nijmegen analysis produces a @xmath1datum = 1.09not quite perfect anymore .      in the 1990 s",
    ", one focus has been on the quantitative aspect of the @xmath0 potentials .",
    "even the best @xmath0 models of the 1980 s  @xcite fit the @xmath0 data typically with a @xmath2/datum @xmath6 or more .",
    "this is still substantially above the perfect @xmath2/datum @xmath7 . to put microscopic nuclear structure theory to a reliable test , one needs a perfect @xmath0 potential such that discrepancies in the predictions can not be blamed on a bad fit of the @xmath0 data .    based upon the nijmegen analysis and the ( pruned ) nijmegen 1992 database , new charge - dependent @xmath0 potentials were constructed in the early / mid 1990 s .",
    "the groups involved and the names of their new creations are , in chronological order :    * nijmegen group  @xcite : nijm - i , nijm - ii , and reid93 potentials .",
    "* argonne group  @xcite : @xmath8 potential .",
    "* bonn group  @xcite : cd - bonn potential .",
    "all these potentials have in common that they use about 45 parameters and fit the pruned 1992 nijmegen data base with a @xmath2/datum @xmath7 .",
    "however , since 1993 the @xmath3 database has substantially expanded and for the current database the @xmath2/datum produced by some of these potentials is not so perfect anymore ( see sec .  2.3.2 . and table  [ tab_chi2 ] below ) .    concerning the theoretical basis of these potential",
    ", one could say that they are all  more or less  constructed ` in the spirit of meson theory ' ( e.g. , all potentials include the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) contribution ) .",
    "however , there are considerable differences in the details leading to considerable off - shell differences among the potentials .",
    ".modern high - precision @xmath0 potentials and their predictions for the two- and three - nucleon bound state . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_chi2 ]      @xmath0 potentials designed for nuclear structure purposes are typically fitted to the @xmath0 scattering data up to pion production thereshold or slightly beyond ( e.  g. , 350 mev ) .",
    "a very basic reason for this is that a real potential can not describe the inelasticities of particle production . on the other hand ,",
    "nuclear structure calculations are probably sensitive to the properties of a potential above 350 mev .",
    "for example , the brueckner @xmath9-matrix , which is a crucial quantity in many microscopic approaches to nuclear structure , is the solution of the integral equation , @xmath10 notice that the potential @xmath11 is involved in this equation for all momenta from zero to infinity , on- and off - shell .",
    "now , it may very well be true that , as the momenta increase , their importance may decrease ( due to the short - range repulsion of the nuclear force and the associated short - range suppression of the nuclear wave function ) .",
    "however , it is also true that the impact of the potential does not suddenly drop to zero as soon as the momenta involved become larger than the equivalent of 350 mev lab .  energy .",
    "thus , there are good physics arguments why @xmath0 potentials should extrapolate in a reasonable way towards higher energies .",
    "we have investigated this issue and found good and bad news .",
    "the good news is that most potentials reproduce in most partial waves the @xmath0 phase shifts up to about 1000 mev amazingly well .",
    "the bad news is that there are some singular cases where the reproduction of phase parameters for higher energies is disturbingly bad .",
    "the two most notorious cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_extra ] . above 350 mev ,",
    "the @xmath12 mixing parameter is substantially underpredicted by both nijmegen potentials ( n - i and n - ii ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , for @xmath12 , both potentials follow very closely the nijmegen psa  @xcite ( solid dots in fig .",
    "[ fig_extra ] ) up to 350 mev .",
    "thus , these potentials are faithfull extrapolations of the nijmegen psa to higher energies . since this extrapolation is wrong , the suspicion is that the nijmegen psa has a wrong trend in the energy range 250 - 350 mev .",
    "new data on @xmath3 spin transfer coefficients  @xcite in the energy range 300 - 500 mev could resolve the issue .",
    "a similar problem occurs in @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_extra ] ) . here , the dashed curve (",
    "n - i ) is the extrapolation of the nijmegen psa , indicating that the analysis may have the wrong trend in the energy range 200 - 350 mev .",
    "we note that , in the two channels discussed , the inelasticity has little impact on the phase parameters shown and would not fix the problems .",
    "the moral is that one should not follow just one analysis , particularly , if that analysis is severely limited in its energy range .",
    "it is important to also keep the broad picture in mind .",
    "we asked the question : how perfect are the perfect potentials  on quantitative grounds ?",
    "the concise and discreet answer is : some high - quality potentials have room for improvement .",
    "during the past decade or so , the research on the @xmath0 interaction has proceeded essentially along two lines .",
    "there was the phenomenological line which has produced the high - precision , charge - dependent @xmath0 potentials  @xcite .",
    "this was practical work , necessary to provide reliable input for exact few - body calculations and nuclear many - body theory .",
    "the goal of the second line of research was to approach the problem on a more fundamental level . since about 1980",
    ", we have seen many efforts to derive the nuclear force from the underlying theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . due to its nonperturbative character in the low - energy regime",
    ", qcd can not be solved exactly for the problem under consideration .",
    "therefore , so - called qcd - related or qcd - inspired models have been developed , like , skyrmion or soliton models  @xcite and constituent quark cluster models  @xcite .",
    "the success of these efforts is mixed .",
    "predictions are typically only of qualitative nature ; and if predictions are quantitative then it s due to an admixture of traditional meson exchanges .    in summary ,",
    "one problem of the current status in the field is that quantitative models for the nuclear force have only a poor theoretical background , while theory based models yield only poor results .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and practice has become rather larger than smaller , in the course of the 1990s .",
    "another problem is that the ` theory based models ' are not strictly derived from qcd , they are modeled after qcd  often with handwoven arguments .",
    "thus , one may argue that these models are not any better than the traditional meson - exchange models ( that are nowadays perceived as phenomenology ) .",
    "the purpose of physics is to explain nature in fundamental terms .",
    "the two trends just discussed are moving us away from this aim , which is reason for serious concern .",
    "therefore , the main goal of future research on the nuclear force must be to overcome the above discrepancies . to achieve this goal ,",
    "_ we need a basic theory that is amenable to calculation and yields quantitative results .",
    "_      in recent years , the concept of effective field theories ( eft ) has drawn considerable attention in particle and nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ effective _ field theories may suggest a difference to _ fundamental _ field theories .",
    "however , it is quite likely that all field theories ( including those that we perceive presently as fundamental ) are effective in the sense that they are low - energy approximations to some ` higher ' theory .",
    "the basis of the eft concept is the recognition of different energy scales in nature .",
    "each energy level has its characteristic degrees of freedom .",
    "as the energy increases and smaller distances are probed , new degrees of freedom become relevant and must be included .",
    "conversely , when the energy drops , some degrees of freedom become irrelevant and are frozen out .    to model the low - energy theory , one relies on a famous ` folk theorem ' by weinberg  @xcite which states :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if one writes down the most general possible langrangian , including _ all _ terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles , and then calculates matrix elements with this langrangian to any given order of perturbation theory , the result will simply be the most general possible s - matrix consistent with analyticity , perturbative unitarity , cluster decomposition , and the assumed symmetry principles .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the essential point of an effective field theory is that we are not allowed to make any assumption of simplicity about the lagrangian and , consequently , we are not allowed to assume renormalizability .",
    "the langrangian must include all possible terms , because this completeness guarantees that the effective theory is indeed the low - energy limit of the underlying theory .",
    "now , this implies that we are faced with an infinite set of interactions . to make the theory managable",
    ", we need to organize a perturbation expansion . then , up to a certain order in this expansion , the number of terms that contribute is finite and the theory will yield a well - defined result .    in strong interactions ,",
    "the transition from the ` fundamental ' to the effective level happens through a phase transition that takes place around @xmath14 gev via the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which generates pseudoscalar goldstone bosons .",
    "therefore , at low energies ( @xmath15 ) , the relevant degrees of freedom are not quarks and gluons , but pseudoscalar mesons and other hadrons .",
    "approximate chiral symmetry is reflected in the smallness of the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the effective theory that describes this scenario is known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath16pt )  @xcite .    if we believe in the basic ideas of eft , then , at low energies , @xmath16pt is as fundamental as qcd at high energies .",
    "moreover , due to its perturbative arrangement , @xmath16pt can be calculated : order by order .",
    "so , here we may have what we were asking for at the end of the previous sub - section : _ a basic theory that is amenable to calculation . _",
    "therefore , @xmath16pt has the potential to overcome the discrepancy between theory and practice that has beset the theoretical research on the nuclear force for so many years .",
    "the idea to derive nuclear forces from chiral effective lagrangians is not new .",
    "a program was started some 10 years ago by weinberg  @xcite , ordez  @xcite , and van kolck  @xcite .",
    "after the program was initiated , considerable activity ensued  @xcite .",
    "even though all authors start from chiral effective langrangians , there are considerable differences in the details . among all these effeorts , the recent work by epelbaum , glckle , and meiner  @xcite is particularly promising .",
    "the details of how to derive the @xmath0 potential from chiral effective langrangians ( up to next - to - next - to - leading order ) are explained in the contribution by epelbaum to these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "therefore , i will not go into this and , instead , recommend to the interested reader to study this beautiful contribution .",
    "however , i like to point out one attractive point of the @xmath16pt approach .",
    "if , in the traditional approach , one wants to reproduce , e.  g. , the experimental binding energies of the triton , the alpha particle or other nuclei , one complements the @xmath0 potential with a ( phenomenological ) three - nucleon force ( 3nf )  @xcite . since different @xmath0 potentials leave different discrepancies to experiment ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab_pots ] ) , the 3nf is adjusted from potential to potential . from a more fundamental point of view , this proceedure is very unsatisfactory , since it lacks any underlying systematics . however , within the framework of traditional meson theory , there is nothing else you can do , because there is no _ a priori _ connection between the off - shell @xmath0 potential and the existence of certain many - body forces .    in the framework of @xmath16pt",
    ", there is this connection from the outset . in each order of @xmath16pt ,",
    "the two - nucleon force is well - defined on- and off - shell _ and _ it is also well - defined which 3nf terms occur in that order . at least that s how it should work ` in theory ' .",
    "how it works out in practise remains to be seen .",
    "we need very accurate chiral potentials to pin down these subtleties .",
    "in the past decade , we had essentially two major advances . on the practical side ,",
    "high - precision phenomenological @xmath0 potentials were constructed ( some of which need improvement to keep up with new , more accurate @xmath0 data and recent progress in charge - dependence ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "nuclear physicists became conscious of chiral symmetry ( an important symmetry of qcd ) .",
    "the dynamics created by this symmetry may finally produce @xmath0 potentials that are theoretically sound _ and _ of ` high - precision ' .",

    "<S> have been constructed which are , essentially , phenomenological models . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials are now commonly used as input for exact few - body calculations and microscopic nuclear many - body theory . </S>",
    "<S> i will critically analyses those models and point out their strenghts and weaknesses . </S>",
    "<S> particular emphasis will be on charge dependence . </S>",
    "<S> other recent research was conducted on a more basic level : understanding the nuclear force in terms of the fundamental theory of strong interactions , qcd . </S>",
    "<S> predictions from this sector are typically qualitative in nature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the main problem of the current status in the field is that quantitative models for the nuclear force have a poor theoretical background , while theory based models yield poor results . </S>",
    "<S> the chief challenge for the new millenium is to overcome this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> chiral effective field theory may be a suitable tool to solve the problem . </S>"
