    "a better knowledge of the neutrino property is regarded as one of the crucial keys in searching for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "recent experiments of neutrino oscillation have been able to uncover part of the neutrino properties , such as the neutrino mixing angles and the mass squared differences responsible for the solar neutrino problem and the atmospheric neutrino deficit  @xcite .",
    "however , there exists an ambiguity in the sign of the squared difference @xmath6 involved in the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the two scenarios are referred to as the normal ( @xmath7 ) and the inverted ( @xmath8 ) mass hierarchies .",
    "furthermore , although an upper bound on the mixing angle @xmath0 is established by @xmath9  @xcite , a definite determination of this angle has not been achieved yet .",
    "the rich physical content of a core - collapse supernova makes the supernova neutrino one of the most promising tools for the study of unknown neutrino properties and the supernova mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the supernova neutrinos are unique in that both neutrinos and antineutrinos are produced at very high densities and high temperatures before propagating through matter of varying densities . due to the wide range of matter density in a supernova , the neutrinos may go through two or even three ( if the regeneration effect due to the earth matter occurs ) separate flavor conversions before reaching the terrestrial detectors .",
    "furthermore , the matter - enhanced oscillations  @xcite in a core - collapse supernova lead to a striking feature that a small variation of the mixing angle @xmath0 can significantly alter the neutrino spectra . for supernova neutrinos ,",
    "the main physical consequence arising from the ambiguity of the mass hierarchy is that both the higher and the lower level crossings occur in the @xmath10 sector if the mass hierarchy is normal , while the higher crossing occurs in the @xmath11 sector and the lower crossing occurs in the @xmath10 sector if the mass hierarchy is inverted .",
    "the future galactic supernova is capable of inducing roughly @xmath12 neutrino events at the terrestrial detectors , and is expected to provide a much better statistics than the sn1987a  @xcite did .",
    "this promising characteristic has motivated a wealth of discussions on how the neutrino fluxes from a supernova can facilitate the search of the unknown neutrino properties  @xcite .",
    "as generally realized , the main difficulty in extracting information from the supernova neutrinos arises from the poorly known exploding mechanism .",
    "incomplete knowledge of the supernova leads to , among others , an uncertainty in the density profile of a supernova .",
    "the supernova neutrinos are usually assumed to propagate outward through an inverse power - law matter density , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "however , due to lack of statistically significant real data , there is no clear evidence showing that the density distribution @xmath15 provides a reliable connection between the dynamics of flavor conversion and the expected neutrino events at the detectors . in addition , the shock propagation in a supernova  @xcite represents a time - dependent disturbance to the matter density and causes a sizable effect to the neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "since only the matter density near a resonance point is relevant to the flavor conversion and any local deviation from @xmath14 can not be ruled out , the profile @xmath15 should not be considered as a satisfactory description to the density shape for the purpose of extracting neutrino properties from the observation of supernova neutrinos .    in this work , possible consequences resulting from variation of the density profile are examined .",
    "the aim is to analyze the neutrino survival probabilities and to study how the uncertainty in @xmath2 would affect the determination of the mixing angle @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the @xmath2-dependent formulation of the survival probabilities for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in section iii , parameters obtained from the solar , the atmospheric , and the terrestrial experiments are taken as the input for constructing the 3d plots of the probability functions .",
    "the probability functions under both the normal and the inverted mass hierarchies are analyzed . in section iv , we discuss the feasibility of probing the neutrino mass hierarchy and @xmath0 with the properties of the probability functions . in section",
    "v , the discussion is expanded to include the earth matter effect .",
    "we then summarize this work in section vi .",
    "the density profile of matter encountered by the propagating neutrinos plays a crucial role in the dynamics of flavor conversion . in the literature",
    ", the neutrino flavor conversion in media of various density profiles has been widely discussed .",
    "however , the exact solution is obtained only for a few specific density distributions : the linear , exponential , hyperbolic tangent , and the @xmath16 profiles .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that for an arbitrary inverse power - law density @xmath13 , an extra correction factor @xmath17 ( a function of @xmath2 and the mixing angle ) can be supplemented to the standard landau - zener  @xcite formulation of the level crossing to account for the effect due to deviation from a linear density profile .    with the extremely high electron number density in a supernova ,",
    "the effective mixing angles in matter for the neutrino and the antineutrino become @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , respectively . using the standard parametrization of the neutrino mixing matrix : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ,",
    "the survival probabilities for @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be written respectively as  @xcite    @xmath25    @xmath26    for the normal hierarchy and    @xmath27    @xmath28    for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "note that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) represent the higher and the lower level crossing probabilities for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , respectively . for arbitrary density profile and mixing angle ,",
    "the landau - zener formula is modified as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 are the adiabaticity parameters , @xmath35 are the mixing angles between the @xmath36th and the @xmath37th mass eigenstates , and @xmath38 are the correction factors to a non - linear profile .",
    "note that @xmath39 , and that @xmath32 can be obtained directly from @xmath31 by replacing @xmath35 with @xmath40 .    for a typical core - collapse supernova ,",
    "the electron number density can be written as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the electron number per baryon , @xmath43 is the baryon mass , and @xmath44 is a constant representing the scale of the density varies very weakly with @xmath45 over the range @xmath46  @xcite . ] .",
    "the adiabaticity parameter for this density profile has the general form    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the fermi constant , @xmath49 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath50 . in the numerical calculation",
    ", it would be more convenient to write @xmath51 and @xmath52 as the euler integral representation of the hypergeometric function :    @xmath53^{(\\frac{n-1}{2n } ) } dt .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above expressions for @xmath54 , @xmath34 , and @xmath38 can be applied to an arbitrary profile and to both large or small mixing angles .",
    "it was pointed out  @xcite that there exists a subtlety in the physical meaning of resonance conversion : for the large mixing angle , the adiabaticity parameters , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , should each be calculated at the point of maximum violation of adiabaticity ( pmva ) instead of the point of resonance . note that while the values of @xmath34 depend on the locations where they are calculated , the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 remain invariant . to simplify the calculation",
    ", we choose to evaluate @xmath57 and @xmath58 at the locations of resonance .",
    "with the numerical input of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath44 ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) , the survival probability functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 reduce to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the ambiguity of the mass hierarchy gives rise to four distinct probability functions to be investigated : @xmath68 , @xmath69 for the normal hierarchy and @xmath70 , @xmath71 for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "their properties can be examined by a series of 3d plots in the @xmath72 parameter space . as an illustration",
    ", we show only the 3d plots of @xmath68 for several @xmath2 values in fig .",
    "1 . from the 3d plots of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71",
    ", it can be concluded that all the probabilities exhibit no significant energy dependence except for the low energy end .",
    "this behavior implies that when the adiabaticity parameters in eq .",
    "( 6 ) are calculated , the impact coming from the variation of @xmath2 and @xmath0 dominate over that of the variation of energy in the typical range , @xmath73 mev .",
    "since the neutrino population is extremely small at the low energy end of the spectrum , it would be convenient to simply take the average energies , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath74 mev and @xmath75 mev , in the numerical calculation .",
    "this approximation further reduces the probabilities to functions of only @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the survival probabilities for @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be plotted in the @xmath76 space , as shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that if @xmath77 , the values of all the probability functions approach a constant @xmath78 regardless of the mass hierarchy and the value of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the mass hierarchies are indistinguishable and the information about @xmath0 is lost if @xmath77 . as @xmath2 increases from @xmath79 , the probability functions of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "2 are seen to drop through a transition near @xmath80 , while that of @xmath4 in fig .",
    "3 jump through a transition near @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath68 and @xmath71 exhibit an extra non - trivial structure for @xmath82 . in the following discussion",
    ", we divide @xmath2 into three regions : @xmath77 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the probability functions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 shall be discussed separately .",
    "we first note that the condition @xmath84 is satisfied if the higher crossing is extremely non - adiabatic : @xmath85 , as implied by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pe ] ) and  ( [ eq : pei ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath68 and @xmath70 are indistinguishable if the values of @xmath2 and @xmath86 result in @xmath85 , which occurs in part of the @xmath5 parameter space , as can be seen by comparing figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) . to account for the @xmath2-dependent transition of both @xmath68 and @xmath70 in the range @xmath87",
    ", we note that the adiabatic parameter at the lower crossing takes the form @xmath88 which yields @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( non - adiabatic transition ) for @xmath77 . on the other hand",
    ", the same expression leads to @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( adiabatic transition ) when @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 goes through a transition from @xmath89 to @xmath91 as @xmath2 varies from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath95 at @xmath96 , while @xmath97 at @xmath98 if @xmath99 .",
    "this result implies that the uncertainty of @xmath2 between @xmath98 and @xmath96 could lead to a variation of the survival probability by a factor of two and complicate the interpretation of the @xmath3 events .",
    "the 3d plots of @xmath70 and @xmath68 in the @xmath76 space become distinguishable for @xmath100 if @xmath101 .",
    "note that for @xmath82 , @xmath92 and @xmath68 becomes @xmath102 where @xmath29 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pc ] ) , and the adiabaticity parameter @xmath55 in @xmath29 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) : @xmath103    for @xmath104 , the subtle dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath2 and @xmath86 can be seen clearly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nud ] ) and fig .",
    "2 . for small @xmath105 and large @xmath0 ( near the right corner of fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , the higher level crossing is adiabatic ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) .",

    "the higher level crossing becomes non - adiabatic ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) for relatively larger @xmath105 and smaller @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nud ] ) begins to dominate , and @xmath111 . note that since the two values of @xmath29 , @xmath110 and @xmath107 , give rise to the above two distinct values of @xmath68 representing the two sides of the fast transition area in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the condition @xmath112 should reasonably describe the fast transition of @xmath68 for @xmath82 . furthermore , due to the smallness of the upper bound on @xmath0 , the arguments in the numerator of eq .  ( [ eq : pc ] )",
    "satisfy the relation @xmath113 which implies that @xmath114 at the narrow transition region",

    ". take @xmath14 for example , the sudden probability transition is located near @xmath122 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 if @xmath124 , which is unique to the normal mass hierarchy .",

    "2 .    eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) suggests that a slight variation of the power may cause an ambiguity in the interpretation of @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy that are derived from the observation of neutrino events . note that",
    "although the numerical values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) vary with the input parameters , the physical content remains unaltered .",
    "we summarize this subsection as follows .    1 .",
    "given the input values of @xmath61 , @xmath127 , and @xmath44 , it can be shown that @xmath31 is adiabatic ( @xmath91 ) for @xmath82 and non - adiabatic ( @xmath89 ) for @xmath77 .",
    "2 .   for the normal mass hierarchy ,",
    "the two distinct values of @xmath59 due to @xmath110 and @xmath107 for @xmath82 are separated by the condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "3 .   in principle , a direct observation of the @xmath3 events could be used to distinguish the mass hierarchy if the values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 result in @xmath101 , as suggested by figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "the survival probabilities of @xmath4 are described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pa ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : pai ] ) for the normal and the inverted mass hierarchies , respectively .",
    "the 3d plots of @xmath69 and @xmath71 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that @xmath39 , and that @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath32 can be obtained respectively from @xmath56 , @xmath52 , and @xmath31 by the swap @xmath130 . since @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath77 , it follows that    @xmath133    this explains why the mass hierarchies are also indistinguishable from observing the @xmath4 events if @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the transition behavior of @xmath69 and @xmath71 for @xmath83 can be explained in the way similar to that of @xmath68 and @xmath70 .    for @xmath82 ,",
    "the lower level crossing becomes adiabatic : @xmath134 .",
    "if the higher crossing remains non - adiabatic ( @xmath132 ) , it leads to @xmath135 , which is slightly higher than that for @xmath77 .",
    "however , when @xmath30 departs from unity , there would be a sudden drop of the probability function if the mass hierarchy is inverted : @xmath136 , as shown in fig .",
    "the sudden drop of this probability function is similar to that of @xmath68 for the neutrino sector , and can be characterized by the same condition for that of the neutrino , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) , with a slight change of the numerical values .",
    "the properties of all the probability functions for @xmath82 and @xmath77 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we shall now investigate whether and how the information about the mass hierarchy and @xmath0 could be extracted from the observation of supernova neutrinos . although the uncertainty in the density profile is unavoidable due to incomplete knowledge of the supernova mechanism , the results in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 may still provide a useful guideline .",
    "we summarize the hints as follows .    1 .",
    "as suggested by figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , the mass hierarchy may be identified as normal if the survival probability of @xmath3 is observed to be extremely small , @xmath137 , if @xmath138 . on the other hand , an extremely small survival probability for @xmath4 , @xmath139 ,",
    "would signal an inverted hierarchy , as suggested by figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "although this feature provides no information about the mixing angle @xmath0 , it predicts the mass hierarchy without knowing the details of the density shape , _",
    "i.e. _ , the exact value of @xmath2 is irrelevant . note that the numerical values would vary slightly with the input parameters . 2 .",
    "if @xmath140 is observed , the power @xmath2 of the density profile is limited to @xmath77 and a significant deviation from @xmath14 is implied .",
    "the information about mass hierarchy or @xmath0 is unavailable in this case .",
    "if @xmath141 can be deduced from experiments , then @xmath82 , @xmath121 , and the inverted mass hierarchy are implied .",
    "these conditions lead to @xmath142 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath143 is observed , it implies that ( i ) the mass hierarchy is normal and @xmath0 is undetermined ( figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) ) , or ( ii ) the mass hierarchy is inverted and @xmath120 ( figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) ) .",
    "a further observation of the earth matter effect may be useful in selecting the correct scenario .",
    "4 .   from figs . 2(a ) and 3(b ) , it is seen that @xmath0 can be sensitive to the direct observation of @xmath68 or @xmath71 in only part of the parameter space .",
    "as discussed earlier , the prediction of @xmath0 depends crucially on the exact value of @xmath2 in this part of parameter space .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to establish a satisfactory constraint on @xmath0 from a direct observation of @xmath59 or @xmath60 alone .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq : g ] ) suggests that a deviation of @xmath144 from @xmath14 could result in an uncertainty in the prediction of @xmath0 by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "a better knowledge of @xmath2 or an extended analysis that includes the earth matter effect would help set the constraint of this tiny mixing angle .",
    "the regeneration effect of the supernova neutrinos when crossing the earth has been widely discussed  @xcite . since the earth matter density , @xmath145 a few @xmath146 , is roughly the same order of magnitude as the density for the lower level crossing in a supernova , the neutrino fluxes may receive sizable modification due to the oscillation effects in earth . in general ,",
    "the earth matter effect is signaled by the flux difference observed at two terrestrial detectors @xmath147 and @xmath148  @xcite : @xmath149 @xmath150 for the normal mass hierarchy , and @xmath151 @xmath152 for the inverted mass hierarchy . in the above expressions , @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) is the observed @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) flux at the detector @xmath155 , @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) is the probability that a @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) arriving at the earth surface is detected as a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at the detector , and @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) is the initial flux for the specific neutrino ( antineutrino ) , with @xmath162 .",
    "the earth matter effects could affect ( i ) @xmath3 flux only ; ( ii ) @xmath4 flux only ; ( iii ) both @xmath3 and @xmath4 fluxes .",
    "we assume that the suppression of matter effect , if any , is due solely to the smallness of @xmath29 .",
    "possible consequences of the above three scenarios are summarized in table ii and discussed below :    1 .",
    "if the earth effect is observed only in the @xmath3 flux ( @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) , it requires an extremely small @xmath29 under the inverted hierarchy , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : einv ] ) and  ( [ eq : aeinv ] ) .",
    "results in table i show that @xmath165 is possible when @xmath82 and @xmath166 .",
    "these conditions lead to a lower bound on @xmath0 : @xmath167 .",
    "if the earth effect is observed only in the @xmath4 flux ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) , then eqs .",
    "( [ eq : enor ] ) and  ( [ eq : aenor ] ) suggest that @xmath29 is extremely small and the mass hierarchy is normal .",
    "this leads to the same constraint : @xmath167 .",
    "if the earth matter effect is observed in both the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 fluxes , then @xmath170 is required .",
    "it can be seen from table i that this condition can be satisfied if ( i ) @xmath82 and @xmath120 , or ( ii ) @xmath77 . note that , as discussed earlier , the observation of supernova neutrino loses its predictive power if @xmath77 .",
    "even from the first condition : @xmath82 and @xmath120 , an evident constraint on @xmath0 is still not available unless the uncertainty of @xmath2 can be reduced significantly .",
    "furthermore , this scenario provides no information about the mass hierarchy .",
    "there is a possibility that the constraint on @xmath0 might be available from checking the signs of @xmath171 and @xmath172 , if the earth matter effect is observed in both the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 fluxes .",
    "suppose that one of the two detectors , @xmath148 , is not shielded by the earth matter .",
    "it then leads to the replacements : @xmath173 and @xmath174 , which satisfy @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "since the average energies obey the hierarchy : @xmath177 and @xmath178 , there exists an energy @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) at which @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) changes sign  @xcite . in general , @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) in @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) , and @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) in @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of @xmath31 varies from 0 ( for @xmath82 ) to @xmath191 ( for @xmath77 ) , and @xmath32 varies from 0 to @xmath192 .",
    "thus , @xmath193 is always positive , while @xmath194 flips sign over the transition region @xmath195 .",
    "the above arguments suggest the following :    1 .",
    "if @xmath171 and @xmath172 are both observed to be negative at the high energy end of the spectrum , or both positive at the low energy end , then it implies @xmath196 ( from table i ) , @xmath82 , and @xmath166 .",
    "this leads to the constraint : @xmath167 .",
    "however , the mass hierarchy is undetermined from this result .",
    "2 .   if @xmath171 and @xmath172 are of opposite signs , then @xmath197 , and @xmath77 .",
    "no further information about @xmath0 or the mass hierarchy is available .",
    "we summarize the above results in table iii .",
    "the supernova neutrinos may provide a promising future for the study of unknown neutrino properties . however , the detailed knowledge of the core - collapse supernova event is still far from complete .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in the original neutrino fluxes and in the effects due to the shock propagation , the original neutrino spectra can be further deformed by the flavor conversion when the neutrinos propagate through matter of uncertain density profiles .    in this work ,",
    "parameters obtained from recent experiments are taken as the input for the purpose of analyzing the survival probabilities of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is suggested that the influence coming from the energy variation can be excluded .",
    "the effort is then focused on investigating how the unknown mass hierarchy , the mixing angle @xmath0 , and the uncertainty in @xmath2 would affect the probability functions .",
    "it is shown that the non - trivial behavior of the probability functions can be well illustrated by the 3d plots in the @xmath76 parameter space , and that the uncertainty of @xmath2 could lead to ambiguity in the interpretation of @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy .",
    "roughly speaking , the probability functions behave differently in three regions of the parameter space : @xmath77 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 . as far as the mass hierarchy and the mixing angle @xmath0 are concerned , the information is lost if the supernova neutrinos encounter a relatively steep density profile ( @xmath77 ) near the location of flavor conversion .",
    "for a not as steep density profile ( @xmath83 ) , all the probability functions go through a transition that is governed by the variation of @xmath2 .",
    "this transition depends only very weakly on the mass hierarchy and @xmath0 . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the probability functions vary with the mass hierarchy , the value of @xmath2 , and @xmath0 in a non - trivial fashion , as depicted clearly by figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "furthermore , this non - trivial structure is found to be divided by a function of @xmath2 and @xmath0 through the condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .    for the qualitative observation of the earth matter effect",
    ", it can be shown that the constraint on @xmath0 would be available only if @xmath82 . however , the exact value of @xmath2 is irrelevant to the constraint as long as @xmath2 is greater than @xmath198 .",
    "it is hoped that eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) and the 3d plots of the probability functions could provide a guideline to finding useful observables from the future supernova neutrino experiments , and to better help shed light on the desired understanding of the neutrino properties .",
