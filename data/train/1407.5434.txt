    "since the introduction of the burger s equation by bateman@xcite , many authors have used variety of numerical methods in attempting to solve the burger s equation .",
    "various forms of the finite element methods are constructed to compute the burger s equation numericallyad , ad1,nu2,sku , ad5,ofem3,bspgal , qq , zi . the spline collocation procedures are also presented for getting solutions of the burger s equationrt , er , ras , cbspcol , irk , ram , qbspcol2,qbspcol , dag , quincol .",
    "the spline functions are wished to be accompanied to the numerical method to solve the differential equations since the resulting matrix system is always diagonal and can be solved easily and approximate solutions having the accuracy of the degree less than the degree of the spline functions can be set up .",
    "high order continuous differentiable approximate solutions can be produced for the differential equations of higher order .",
    "the numerical procedure for nonlinear evolution equations based on the the b - spline collocation method have been increasingly applied to various fields of science .",
    "however application of the ctb collocation method to non linear evolution problems are a few in comparison with the method the collocation based on the b - spline functions .",
    "the numerical methods for solving a type of ordinary differential equations with quadratic and cubic ctb are given by a. nikolis in the papersg1,g2 .",

    "the another numerical method employed the cubic ctb are set up to solve a class of linear two - point singular boundary value problems in the study@xcite . very recently a collocation finite difference scheme based on new cubic ctb is developed for the numerical solution of a one - dimensional hyperbolic equation ( wave equation ) with non - local conservation condition@xcite .",
    "a new two - time level implicit technique based on the cubic ctb is proposed for the approximate solution of the nonclassical diffusion problem with nonlocal boundary condition in the study@xcite .",
    "some researches have established types of the b - spline finite element approaches for solving the burger s equation  but  not with ctb as far as we know the literature .    in this paper , ctb are used to establish a collocation method  and then the suggested numerical method is applied to find the numerical solutions of burger s equation .",
    "it is also well - known that this problem arise in many branch of the science and the development of the numerical methods for the burger s equation have been attracted for finding the steep front solutions .",
    "the use of the lower  viscosity in the burger s equation cause the appearance of the steep front and shock wave solutions . that makes difficulty in modelling solutions of the burger s equation when solved numerically .",
