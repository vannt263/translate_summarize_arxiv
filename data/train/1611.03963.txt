    "magneto - electric coupling in magnetic materials and heterostructures enables control of magnetization by electric field , which is the key requirement for realization of energy - efficient spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "recent progress in this field includes demonstration of electric field induced magnetization reversal @xcite and ferromagnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "however , ferromagnetic resonance driven by electric field can not be used for generation of spin waves with wavelengths smaller than the excitation region , which limits its applicability in nanomagnonic devices based on short - wavelength spin waves @xcite . here",
    "we report parametric excitation of spin waves in a ferromagnet by alternating electric field . unlike ferromagnetic resonance",
    ", parametric resonance can be employed for generation and amplification of short - wavelength spin waves and thus our work is an important step towards the development of energy - efficient nanomagnonics .    a prominent manifestation of the magneto - electric coupling in magnetic films and heterostructures is modification of magnetic anisotropy by electric field @xcite .",
    "this recently discovered effect takes place at the interface between a ferromagnetic metal ( e.g.  fe ) and a nonmagnetic insulator ( e.g.  mgo ) @xcite and originates from different rates of filling of @xmath0-like electron bands in response to electric field applied perpendicular to the interface @xcite . since electrons in different bands contribute unequally to the uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) at the interface , electric field can be used to modulate pma .",
    "this voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy ( vcma ) is promising for energy - efficient manipulation of magnetization @xcite because , unlike spin torque ( st ) , vcma does not rely on high electric current density resulting in large ohmic losses . in this work ,",
    "we employ vcma modulation at microwave frequencies in order to excite parametric resonance of magnetization in a nanomagnet @xcite .",
    "parametric excitation of magnetization by external magnetic field has been thoroughly studied in bulk and thin - film ferromagnets @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "a parameter of the magnetic system ( external field ) is modulated with a frequency at twice a spin wave frequency @xmath1 of the system .",
    "parametric excitation is a nonlinear process , in which the parametric drive acts as negative effective magnetic damping competing with positive intrinsic damping @xcite . at a threshold amplitude of the parametric drive , the negative damping exceeds the intrinsic damping and magnetization oscillations at half the drive frequency are excited .",
    "parametric excitation of magnetization has several important advantages over direct excitation by external magnetic field with a frequency at @xmath1 .",
    "first , parametric excitation efficiently couples not only to the uniform precession of magnetization but also to spin wave eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "this allows excitation of short wavelength spin waves by simply choosing the parametric drive frequency to be twice the desired spin wave frequency .",
    "second , parametric pumping can be used for frequency - selective amplification of spin waves @xcite and phase error corrections @xcite .",
    "all these properties of parametric pumping form a highly desirable set of tools for the nascent field of nanomagnonics @xcite . however , parametric excitation of spin waves by microwave magnetic field in metallic ferromagnets is not energy - efficient because of the relatively high threshold fields ( tens of oe ) @xcite . here",
    "we show that replacing magnetic field pumping by electric field ( vcma ) pumping solves this problem and allows parametric excitation of magnetic oscillations in metallic ferromagnets by a low - power microwave drive .",
    "we demonstrate parametric excitation of magnetization in 70nm@xmath2150 nm elliptical nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) schematically shown in fig.[f : fmr]a .",

    "the equilibrium direction of the co@xmath3fe@xmath4b@xmath3 free layer magnetization is normal to the sample plane due to interfacial pma @xcite .",
    "prior to patterning , the multilayers are annealed for 2 hours at 300@xmath8c in a 10koe in - plane magnetic field that sets the pinned layer exchange bias direction parallel to the mtj long axis .",
    "all measurements reported in this article are made in the setup schematically shown in fig.[f : fmr]a that allows application of dc and microwave voltages to the mtj and measurement of dc and microwave signals generated by the mtj .",

    "the hysteresis loop and micromagnetic simulations confirm the out - of - plane easy axis of the free layer ( see supplementary section 1 ) .",
    "the center of the loop is shifted from zero field due to a residual 0.06koe stray field from the saf .",
    "we employ spin torque ferromagnetic resonance ( st - fmr ) to characterize the spectral properties of spin wave eigenmodes of the mtj . in this technique , a small amplitude microwave drive current @xmath14 applied to the mtj excites oscillations of magnetization at the drive frequency @xmath15 .",

    "the data in fig.1e in the main text gives vcma efficiency @xmath82oe / v , which is typical for this material system @xcite .",
    "for the theoretical description of parametric resonance of the mtj free layer we employ a single - mode approximation .",
    "we expand the free layer magnetization into static and dynamic parts : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the unit vector in the direction of the static magnetization , @xmath85 is the coordinate - dependent vector structure of the spin wave mode , and @xmath42 is the dimensionless amplitude of this mode .",
    "starting from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation , the following nonlinear equation describing the dynamics can be derived @xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the spin wave mode angular frequency , @xmath88 is the nonlinear frequency shift of the mode , @xmath89 is the damping rate of the mode , @xmath90 is the effective pumping field amplitude , @xmath91 is the pumping frequency , @xmath92 is the efficiency of parametric interaction , and @xmath93 describes thermal noise ( see ref .   for details ) . in these notations ,",
    "the parametric resonance threshold field is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , @xmath81 is the gyromagnetic ratio taken to be 176ghz / t , @xmath96t@xmath97m / a is the permeability of vacuum , and the damping rate @xmath98ghz @xcite .",
    "averaged ellipticity of the spin wave mode @xmath99 is given by @xcite : @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes a spatial average over the free layer volume .",
    "we calculate the quasi - uniform mode ellipticity from the micromagnetic mode profile .",
    "this calculation gives @xmath102 , which results in @xmath103 = 6.5ka / m = 82oe .",
    "this gives the threshold voltage for excitation of parametric resonance @xmath104 = 0.156v .",
    "this micromagnetic value of @xmath39 is significantly higher than that given by the macrospin approximation with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 ( with @xmath107ka / m ) , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are components of the free layer demagnetization tensor @xcite , and @xmath110ghz is the spin wave mode frequency .",
    "the higher value of ellipticity ( @xmath111 ) in the macrospin approximation leads to a lower parametric threshold : @xmath103 = 45oe and @xmath39 = 0.085v .",
    "as expected , the experimentally measured value of the threshold voltage @xmath39 = 0.136v is much higher than that given by the macrospin approximation but it is similar to that appropriate for micromagnetic profile of the quasi - uniform mode .",
    "the 15% discrepancy between the measured and the theoretically predicted threshold could arise from deviation of the free layer shape from the ideal elliptical shape assumed in the simulations and from over - estimation of the damping parameter of the free layer .",
    "to determine the threshold voltage for parametric excitation @xmath39 from the experimental data in fig.3 of the main text , we fit these data to theoretical expressions of the oscillation power as a function of the drive amplitude @xmath17 .",
    "these expressions are derived below for two limits : @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "well below the threshold ( @xmath48 ) , the nonlinear frequency shift in eq . can be neglected and the parametric resonance frequency @xmath38 is equal to twice the spin wave mode frequency ( @xmath112 ) . in this limit , the reduced integrated power @xmath40 of the spin wave mode is given by the expression below when the free layer is driven exactly at the parametric resonance frequency @xmath38 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes a thermal average . in deriving this expression , we assumed white thermal noise : @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are constants .",
    "here we also employed the linear relation between the effective ( vcma ) pumping field amplitude @xmath90 and the microwave voltage amplitude @xmath17 , which is evident from fig.1e of the main text .    by expanding the noise term into fourier series",
    ", we obtain the following expression for reduced power spectral density @xmath44 of the spin wave mode oscillations : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a constant . setting @xmath122 in eq .",
    ", we obtain an expression for the peak value of the reduced psd that is observed at @xmath123 : @xmath124          well above the threshold ( @xmath51 ) , the integrated power of the parametrically excited quasi - uniform mode is nearly temperature independent and can be approximated by its zero - temperature value @xcite . neglecting the thermal noise term in eq .",
    ", we derive : @xmath126    we assume that the deviation of @xmath38 from @xmath61 is small , so that the second term in the parentheses can be neglected compared to the first term . in this case , eq . takes a simple form : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a constant .      the fitting of the normalized peak power data shown in fig.3 of the main text to eq .",
    "and eq . was performed by the least squares method with @xmath50 , @xmath53 and @xmath39 as fitting parameters .",
    "a range of data near the threshold voltage must be excluded in the fitting procedure because neither eq . nor",
    "is valid at the threshold voltage .",
    "we chose the data range where @xmath129v for the low - power fit and the data range where @xmath55v for the high - power fit ( the excluded data range is @xmath130v ",
    "@xmath131v ) because the best fit parameters do not change significantly upon further extension of the excluded data range .",
