    "we would expect that the stress induced through a contraction of the ho silicide @xmath24- and @xmath25-axes at the interface , would be released through an expansion in the perpendicular direction and such behaviour has been directly observed in other rare earth silicide surfaces @xcite . in particular , ye have reported an expansion in the @xmath6-axis of the silicide relative to the bulk value for dy on si(100 ) @xcite .",
    "one explanation of this observation could be that the silicide is incommensurate with the si substrate .",

    "this large value of the silicide @xmath6-axis does not make sense according to the established trend in strain either , as it would be expected that the lack of strain at the interface would not cause any expansion in the @xmath6-axis of the silicide relative to the bulk value .",
    "thus it can be concluded that it is not the bulk form of the silicide that is present on the surface ; it must be some intermediate form",
