    ". it would be very helpful to check the simulation approach for a case for which meaningful validation data is available to check the results .",
    "therefore , before turning our attention to the interesting problem of h - ingestion events in metal - poor stars , we perform for the first time 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of the h - ingestion flash in sakurai s object ( v4334 sgr ) , a post - agb star that experienced a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) .",
    "real - time observations of the light curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as post - flash abundance observations @xcite provide constraints on the details of the he - shell flash with h - ingestion in this case .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath29 times faster rise time of sakurai s object compared to standard mixing - length theory ( mlt ) stellar evolution predictions can be accounted for if it is assumed that in h - ingestion phases the convective mixing efficiency is reduced by a factor of @xmath30 to @xmath31 , which leads to a h - combustion energy release closer to the stellar surface , where the time scale for thermal response is shorter .",
    "@xcite showed that an early mixing split between the he - shell flash convection zone ( reduced in size ) and the newly emerging h - burning convection zone prevents standard stellar evolution models from reproducing the observed abundance features , especially the pronounced overabundance of first - peak neutron capture elements .",
    "however , an assumed mixing permeability of the interface between the two convection zones lasting for @xmath32 after the h - ingestion event started does enable one to account for most observed abundance features .    in both cases",
    "1-d stellar evolution assumptions fail to reproduce key observables . in sect.[sec : method ] we describe the method and how the simulations were performed , while sect.[sec : results ] presents our main findings and discussion of the results .",
    "we use the 3-d gas dynamics code and the initial setup method described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the code features the piecewise - parabolic - boltzmann ( ppb ) moment - conserving advection scheme ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provides an effective resolving power of the fluid distribution that requires two to three times the grid resolution to be matched by a code based on the piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ) without ppb .",
    "as in previous investigations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we adopt a monatomic ideal gas equation of state which represents the conditions in he - shell flash convection in the post - agb he - shell flash model for sakurai s object well ( fig.[fig : initial_star ] ) .",
    "the nuclear burn module considers just the @xmath10 reaction @xcite with an energy release of @xmath33 .",
    "the two - fluid setup consists of a convectively unstable shell and a stable layer below with initially the @xmath0-rich fluid conv , and a stable layer above the convection zone with the h - rich fluid h+he. both of these composite fluids have realistic mean molecular weights reflecting the abundance mix for intershell and envelope material according to the corresponding stellar evolution model .",
    "the nuclear burn module takes appropriately into account that in each of the fluids only a certain fraction participates in the nuclear reaction .",
    "we ignore for now the energy release of @xmath34 from the subsequent @xmath35-decay of @xmath36  with a half life of @xmath37 .",
    "using the reaction rate length scale introduced by @xcite as a 1-d estimate of the geometric scale of the h - burning layer @xmath36  would decay after being homogenized throughout a layer approximately 20 times the thickness of the burn layer .",
    "here we are interested in the emergence and initial evolution of any hydrodynamic response to h - ingestion and burning which we assume to depend on the localized energy release from the @xmath38 reaction .    the full @xmath1 shell of the convectively unstable layer is included in the simulation , which ensures that any global or large - scale motions can be captured .",
    "the initial setup has been constructed by using the model at @xmath39 from @xcite , which was taken from the @xmath40 post - agb stellar evolution track presented first in @xcite and further modified in @xcite .",
    "the convection is driven by a constant heating of @xmath41 corresponding to the he - shell flash luminosity of the @xmath39 stellar evolution model .",
    "the initial stratification ( fig.[fig : initial_star ] ) is constructed from piecewise polytropic layers that closely resemble the stellar evolution model .",
    "a reflective spherical outer boundary condition is located at @xmath42 .    for our simulation approach",
    "we have investigated in detail the numerical resolution requirements @xcite .",
    "in addition we have performed numerous test simulations for the sakurai s star setup , on the canadian westgrid computer orcinus with grid sizes up to @xmath2 while simulations with @xmath2 , @xmath43 and @xmath3 grids where performed on nsf s blue waters sustained petaflops computing system at ncsa .",
    "the ppmstar code @xcite , which was originally designed to run on the los alamos roadrunner machine ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , performed our run at @xmath3 resolution within a single four - day period on blue waters .",
    "it ran on @xmath44 cpu cores , roughly half the blue waters machine , at a sustained rate of @xmath45 with 64-bit precision . at this computing rate , it took about @xmath46 of real time to simulate @xmath47 of time for the star and to write to disk @xmath48 of visualization data . with @xmath49 data dumps , @xmath50 of data from this run was written , which was used to generate the movies at http://www.lcse.umn.edu/movies .",
    "the movies were generated using our hvr volume rendering utility on the gpu nodes on blue waters .",
    "this computational performance was possible , because our code scales extremely well on blue waters .",
    "each node with @xmath51 cpu cores ran eight mpi processes , each with four threads updating a tiny grid brick of just @xmath52 cells .",
    "we present the results from two runs with a @xmath2 a @xmath3 grid for a minimum duration of @xmath53 star time .",
    "the simulations start in the same way as the entrainment simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "an initial transient phase of less than @xmath54 quickly gives way to fully developed he - shell flash convection with dominant global modes that cause hydrodynamic shear instabilities at the top convection boundary .",
    "downdrafts of h - rich material from above originate where large - scale upwellings and consequently coherent horizontal motions along the convective boundary converge .",
    "h - rich clouds descend into the deeper layers and represent a large - scale inhomogeneous distribution in the region where protons start to react with @xmath0 . during this initial phase of @xmath55",
    "the spherically and radially averaged velocities in both runs agree reasonably well ( fig.[fig : initial_star ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the overall entropy in the convection zone rises due to the addition of energy from nuclear reactions , and mixing throughout the convection zone is efficient enough to maintain a flat spherically averaged entropy profile .",
    "the h - accumulation rate ( entrainment minus burning ) is @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 runs during this initial quiet phase , about a factor four smaller than the converged entrainment rate of @xmath58 found by @xcite for slightly different runs without h burning . as discussed there , this entrainment rate is too small to cause hydrodynamic feedback from the burning of entrained h if the entrainment rate is equated with the h burn rate .",
    "it is therefore consistent that we do not observe noticeable differences in the early quiescent phase between these simulations with h burning and the entrainment simulations of @xcite without h burning .",
    "the quiescent phase lasts for around @xmath59 . in test simulations with a sponging boundary condition",
    "the motions in the upper stable layer are much more pronounced in this setup .",
    "these and other details of the simulations can alter the duration of the quiescent phase significantly .",
    "however , none of our tests indicate that nature of the violent events to follow depend on the details of the quiescent lead - up phase .",
    "the convection hydrodynamics changes dramatically around @xmath59 ( fig.[fig : initial_star ] ) when a major global fluid flow oscillation is about to be launched .",
    "the overall shape of the rise and decay of the oscillation mode agrees well between the two runs , the major difference being that in the lower resolution run the event starts @xmath60 earlier .",
    "the visualization of the 3-d flow for time @xmath61 shows the moment when the flow has already started to respond strongly to the energy input from h burning ( fig.[fig : fv_vort ] ) .",
    "the fractional volume images from the two runs appear to differ more than at the later time ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , this is mostly because we see in the @xmath2-run image a later time in the event .",
    "overall the agreement between the two runs is good .    during the lead - up to this transition at @xmath63 eventually a large enough reservoir of h",
    "is accumulated in the upper part of the convection zone ( fig.[fig : profiles ] ) so that pockets of h - rich material advected into the burn region carries an increasing fraction of fuel . at that point",
    "individual , particularly strong ignition events launch very pronounced , identifiable upwellings .",
    "as these hit the stiff convective boundary above they are deflected in all directions and create enhanced levels of entrainment .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability vorticity - entrainment trains can be clearly identified in the vorticity image ( top row , fig.[fig : fv_vort ] ) .",
    "the horizontal flows proceed along the convective boundary all the way to the antipode where their collision is forcing the h - rich entrainment layer into a downdraft .",
    "this next fuel - enhanced advection stream causes an even more violent ignition event and subsequent launching of the next fast upwelling , which in turn causes the next circumferential flow back close to the point of origin of the first ignition .",
    "this oscillatory back - and - forth repeats for about a dozen times and is clearly identifiable in the averaged velocity time evolution shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : initial_star ] .",
    "we refer to this new phenomenon in stellar physics as the global oscillation of shell h - ingestion ( gosh ) . during the rise time of @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    "are accumulated in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 runs , corresponding to an accumulation rate of @xmath67 and close to the critical entrainment rate for hydrodynamic feedback estimated in @xcite . these highly time - variable and global fluid flows",
    "are better observed in the animated movies available at http://www.lcse.umn.edu/movies .",
    "although the gosh proceeds beyond the initial rise time , its amplitude decreases until convective motions in the upper region of the initially unstable zone are significantly suppressed ( see vorticity image at later time and spherically averaged radial and horizontal velocities shown in fig.[fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "this suppression follows from the entrainment of entropy that goes along with the entrainment of h - rich material from the stable layer above the convection zone ( lower panel fig.[fig : profiles ] ) . in the simulation a new upper boundary of the he - luminosity driven convection forms at @xmath68 that can be seen clearly in both runs for the later time in the fractional volume and the vorticity image .",
    "however , the burning of entrained h - rich material continues to add entropy to the convection zone as well and causes an entropy plateau to develop in the upper region .",
    "the @xmath3 run did not yet get to that point when we stopped it .",
    "but the @xmath69 run with its generally higher entrainment rate shows an upper convection zone is about to form between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "when we continued this lower - resolution run beyond @xmath72 it developed a further non - radial , violent event in which the velocity amplitude in the upper layer above the initial convection zone increases significantly .",
    "this simulation outcome is not reliable because the outer boundary of the domain needs to be moved further out to simulate this following phase accurately . during",
    "the gosh significant and mostly tangential motions are set in place in the stable layer above the convection zone that die down when the oscillations subside . in terms of the averaged velocities ( as those shown in fig.[fig : profiles ] ) these motions are agreeing fairly well between the two grid simulations up to @xmath62 when the gosh is ending . at later times",
    "larger differences are evident .",
    "this is the phase that we need to explore in more detail with higher resolution grids .",
    "what connections can we make between these preliminary results of the 3-d hydrodynamic simulations and the constraints we have so far from comparing simulations with calibrated 1-d models ?",
    "@xcite reproduced observed n - capture element abundances by assuming a constant entrainment rate of @xmath73 for @xmath74 to @xmath75 before terminating further neutron exposure by assuming mixing between the upper and lower region of the convection became inefficient .",
    "our simulations so far show that compared to the very low entrainment we found in he - shell flash convection without feedback from h burning @xcite , entrainment rates are significantly enhanced by the gosh .",
    "however , the gosh leads as well , at least initially , to a self - quenching of convective motions close to the original upper convection boundary due to the entrainment of entropy .",
    "convection is restarted in this layer by h burning and during one ( or perhaps several ) subsequent violent outburst(s ) the entrainment rates may further increase .",
    "these enhanced entrainment rates will have to be sustained so that the observed 2-dex enhancement of first - peak elements sr , rb , zr , y can be reproduced .",
    "in which way this may be possible will have to be revealed by future simulations .",
    "the present simulations show that the h - ingestion is proceeding through periodic bursts of global - mode oscillations and highly variable entrainment rates , and we will have to investigate if such entrainment histories would fundamentally allow the reproduction of the observed abundance features in sakurai s object . in our present simulations the reflective boundary condition is likely unrealistic when the flow becomes very violent in the initially stable layer above .",
    "the location of h - ingestion energy release is related to the time - scale of the born - again light curve of vltp objects @xcite . during the long quiescent phase of our 3-d simulations h",
    "burning takes place in deeper layers of the he - shell flash convection zone , around @xmath76 .",
    "however , when the feedback from h burning becomes evident burning moves up to @xmath77 to @xmath78 , and here the new convective boundary forms after the gosh .",
    "@xcite has associated the light curve time scale of sakurai s object with the mixing efficiency .",
    "our 3-d setup ( fig.[fig : initial_star ] ) is based on this same @xmath40 1-d model used by @xcite .",
    "the unmodified stellar evolution track shows the h - burning location at @xmath79 ( corresponding to a radius @xmath80 ) with a born - again time of @xmath81 , compared to @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for a modified model with reduced mixing efficiency calibrated to reproduce the observed time of @xmath84 . the entropy profile ( fig.[fig : profiles ] ) shows that the h - burning location in the 3-d hydrodynamic simulation indeed agrees very well with the lower - mixing efficiency solution of the calibrated 1-d model , and would lead to a fast born - again time as observed .",
    "this agreement between the location of h - burning in a stellar evolution model calibrated from the light curve , and the location found in the 3-d simulation that has no free parameters provides a first validation of our simulation approach .",
    "our simulations show highly non - radial , global and variable modes with periods of the order of a convective turn - over time .",
    "these global modes of the h - ingestion event can not be captured in 1-d models .",
    "however , 1-d stellar evolution simulations do agree with some aspects of our 3-d simulations , as for example the relatively early emergence of a h - burning convection zone in terms of the entrained mass of h , and the fact that energy - release from h - burning has some influence on the convective properties of the he - burning shell .",
    "this is , for example , opposite to the finding of @xcite that h is mixed all the way to the bottom of the he - shell flash convection zone ( their fig.9 ) , a result that we do not confirm in our 3-d simulations ( fig.[fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "however , the low - z agb thermal pulse has due to lower density a smaller gas pressure fraction ( @xmath85 ) compared to post - agb h - ingestion case where @xmath86 .",
    "this may limit direct comparisons between their and our work .",
    "another difference is that the transition to a h - burning driven convection zone that we report here appears after @xmath87 in our simulation , whereas the @xcite runs stop after @xmath88 .",
    "perhaps those authors did not see a significant hydrodynamic response from h - burning energy release because they stopped the run too early .",
    "however , as we have pointed out here , even with our much longer simulations we can be certain that we have not yet seen the full story of the h - ingestion flash .",
    "finally , we note that our results reported here have to be considered as preliminary .",
    "we have to postpone a more detailed analysis of the results of our simulations until we are able to carry the high resolution run further forward in time .",
