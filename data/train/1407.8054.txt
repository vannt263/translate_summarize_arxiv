    "due to its multifaceted roles in nuclear physics and astrophysics  @xcite as well as new physics beyond the standard model  @xcite , the symmetry energy has become a hot topic in current research frontiers of nuclear physics and astrophysics  @xcite . during the last decade , a lot of experimental , observational and theoretical efforts have been devoted to constraining the magnitude @xmath7 and density slope @xmath8 of the symmetry energy at nuclear saturation density @xmath9 ( @xmath10 @xmath5 ) , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . although important progress has been made , large uncertainties on the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 still exist ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "for instance , while the @xmath11 is determined to be around @xmath13 mev , the extracted @xmath12 varies significantly from about @xmath14 to @xmath15 mev , depending on the observables and analysis methods . to better understand the model dependence and narrow the uncertainties of the constraints is thus of extreme importance .    while many studies on heavy ion collisions and neutron stars have significantly improved our knowledge on the symmetry energy , more and more constraints on the symmetry energy have been obtained in recent years from analyzing the properties of finite nuclei , such as the nuclear binding energy  @xcite , the neutron skin thickness  @xcite , and the resonances and excitations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been realized that the properties of finite nuclei usually provide more precise constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath8 at subsaturation densities rather than at saturation density @xmath9 .",
    "this feature is understandable since the characteristic ( average ) density of finite nuclei is less than @xmath9 . for example , the average density of heavy nuclei ( e.g. , @xmath1pb ) is about @xmath16 @xmath5 , and thus the properties of heavy nuclei most effectively probe the properties of nuclear matter around @xmath16 @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a quite accurate constraint on the symmetry energy at the subsaturation cross density @xmath4 @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath17mev , has been recently obtained from analyzing the binding energy difference of heavy isotope pairs  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the fact that many and precise constraints on the magnitude of @xmath18 around @xmath19 have been obtained , to the best of our knowledge , so far there is only one experimental constraint on the density slope @xmath3 which was obtained from analyzing the neutron skin data of sn isotopes  @xcite .",
    "knowledge on @xmath3 is not only important for understanding the density dependence of the symmetry energy itself , but also plays a central role in determining the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei and the core - crust transition density in neutron stars .",
    "therefore , any new constraints on @xmath3 will be extremely useful .    in the present work , with the precise knowledge of @xmath2",
    ", we demonstrate that the electric dipole polarizability @xmath20 in @xmath1pb measured at the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) via polarized proton inelastic scattering at forward angles , can put a strong limit on the @xmath3 .",
    "we emphasize since at forward angles coulomb excitation dominates , the extracted @xmath20 at rcnp is expected to be a relatively clean isovector indicator with less uncertainties from strong interaction .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter , given by its binding energy per nucleon , can be written as @xmath21where @xmath22 is the baryon density , @xmath23 is isospin asymmetry , @xmath24 is the eos of symmetric nuclear matter , and the symmetry energy is expressed as @xmath25around a reference density @xmath26 , the @xmath27 can be expanded in @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density slope parameter which characterizes the density dependence of the symmetry energy around @xmath26 .",
    "our calculations in the present work are based on the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach with the so - called standard skyrme force ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which includes @xmath31 parameters , i.e. , the @xmath32 skyrme force parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath36 . instead of directly using the @xmath32 skyrme force parameters",
    ", we can express them explicitly in terms of @xmath32 macroscopic quantities , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the incompressibility @xmath39 , the isoscalar effective mass @xmath40 , the isovector effective mass @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , the gradient coefficient @xmath44 , and the symmetry - gradient coefficient @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", we can examine the correlation of properties of finite nuclei with each individual macroscopic quantity by varying individually these macroscopic quantities within their empirical ranges .",
    "recently , this correlation analysis method has been successfully applied to study nuclear matter properties from analyzing nuclear structure observables  @xcite , and will also be used in this work .",
    "the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) provides an important microscopic approach to calculate the electric dipole polarizability in finite nuclei . within the framework of rpa theory , for a given excitation operator @xmath46 , the reduced transition probability from rpa ground state @xmath47 to rpa excitation state @xmath48",
    "is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the unoccupied ( occupied ) single nucleon state ; @xmath51 is the reduced matrix element of @xmath46 ; and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the rpa amplitudes .",
    "the strength function then can be calculated as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy of rpa excitation state @xmath56 .",
    "thus the moments of strength function can be obtained as : @xmath57 in the case of electric dipole ( @xmath58 ) response , the excitation operator is defined as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are proton , neutron and mass number , respectively ; @xmath63 is the nucleon s radial coordinate ; @xmath64 is the corresponding spherical harmonic function . for a given skyrme interaction",
    ", we can calculate the inverse energy - weighted moment @xmath65 using the hf - rpa method , and then obtain the electric dipole polarizability @xmath66 as @xmath67        for the theoretical calculations of electric dipole polarizability in @xmath1pb in the present work , we employ the skyrme - rpa program by col@xmath68 _",
    "@xcite . in this program , the shf mean field and",
    "the rpa excitations are fully self - consistent .",
    "in particular , we calculate the isovector dipole strength in @xmath1pb with a spherical box extending up to @xmath69 fm , a radial mesh of @xmath70 fm and a cutoff energy of @xmath71 mev which denotes the maximum energy of the unoccupied single - particle states in the rpa model space . then the inverse energy - weighted moment @xmath65 is evaluated with an upper integration limit of @xmath72 mev according to the experimental energy range  @xcite , and thus the electric dipole polarizability @xmath20 can be calculated invoking eq .  .",
    "the electric dipole polarizability @xmath20 has been shown to be a sensitive probe of the symmetry energy  @xcite .",
    "in particular , based on the droplet model , roca - maza _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the following relation : @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the mean - square radius and @xmath75 is the symmetry energy coefficient of a finite nucleus of mass number @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , using the empirical relation @xmath76  @xcite and expanding @xmath77 as @xmath78 roca maza _",
    "et al . _ demonstrated that @xmath79 is correlated with both @xmath80 and @xmath12 .",
    "particularly , based on a large and representative set of relativistic and nonrelativistic nuclear mean - field models , they found a strong linear correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath12 and then extracted the constraint @xmath82 mev from the combination of the experimental determination of @xmath79 with the empirical estimate of @xmath83 mev .",
    "one can see that the uncertainty of the estimated @xmath80 leads to a large error of @xmath84 mev for @xmath12 .    instead of expressing @xmath77 in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath12 as in eq .",
    "( [ esymra ] ) , one can also express @xmath80 in terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 noting @xmath88  @xcite , one can then see from eqs .",
    "( [ alphaddm ] ) and ( [ esymr0rc ] ) that @xmath79 in @xmath1pb is also correlated with both @xmath86 and @xmath85 . as we will see in the following , the microscopic rpa calculations indeed show that @xmath89 is sensitive to @xmath80 and @xmath12 as well as to @xmath86 and @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath85 has been stringently constrained recently ( see , e.g. , @xmath90 mev in ref.@xcite ) , the @xmath79 in @xmath1pb can thus be used to constrain the @xmath86 parameter .",
    "to examine the correlation of the @xmath20 in @xmath1pb with each macroscopic quantity , especially on @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we show in fig .",
    "[ alphad ] the @xmath20 in @xmath1pb from shf with the skyrme force msl0  @xcite by varying individually @xmath92 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath37 , and @xmath36 within their empirical uncertain ranges , namely , varying one quantity at a time while keeping all others at their default values in msl0 , for @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ alphad ] that , as eq .",
    "( [ alphaddm ] ) suggests , the @xmath66 in @xmath1pb exhibits strong correlations with both @xmath97 and @xmath98 , while much weaker correlation with other macroscopic quantities .",
    "particularly , the @xmath20 decreases sensitively with @xmath99 while increases rapidly with @xmath100 , implying a fixed value of @xmath20 will lead to a strong positive correlation between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the results for @xmath101 @xmath5 just confirm the correlations of @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath12 reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "for @xmath95 @xmath5 , given that the symmetry energy at @xmath102 @xmath5 has been well constrained as @xmath103 mev , one thus expects the @xmath20 in @xmath1pb can constrain stringently the parameter @xmath104 .    fixing the values of other @xmath105 macroscopic quantities , i.e. , @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath93 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 at their default values in msl0",

    "as expected , it is seen from fig .",
    "[ alphadlc ] that the @xmath20 in @xmath1pb increases ( decreases ) with @xmath104 ( @xmath2 ) for a fixed @xmath107 ( @xmath104 ) . by comparing with the experimental data @xmath108 @xmath109",
    ", one can extract a strong constraint of @xmath110 mev .     in @xmath1pb as a function of @xmath3 for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "the open ( solid ) up- and down - triangles represent the results with @xmath111 and @xmath112 mev , respectively , from shf - rpa calculations with the values of other parameters fixed in msl0 ( obtained in optimization ) .",
    "the band indicates the experimental value of @xmath113 @xmath109 from rcnp  @xcite . ]",
    "the above constraint of @xmath110 mev has been obtained by neglecting the weak correlations between the @xmath20 in @xmath1pb and other @xmath105 macroscopic quantities . to test the robustness of this constraint and to obtain a more precise constraint , for fixed",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , we optimize all other @xmath105 parameters instead of simply fixing them at their default values in msl0 , by minimizing the weighted sum of @xmath114 evaluated from the difference between shf prediction and the experimental data for some selected observables using the simulated annealing technique  @xcite . in particular , in the optimization , we chose the following experimental data of spherical even - even nuclei , i.e. , ( i ) the binding energy @xmath115 of @xmath116o,@xmath117ca , @xmath118ni , @xmath119sr , @xmath120zr , @xmath121sn , @xmath122sm , @xmath1pb  @xcite ; ( ii ) the charge rms radii @xmath123 of @xmath116o , @xmath117ca , @xmath124ni , @xmath119sr , @xmath120zr , @xmath125sn , @xmath122sm , @xmath1pb  @xcite ; ( iii ) the breathing mode energy @xmath126 of @xmath120zr,@xmath127sn,@xmath122sm and @xmath1pb  @xcite . in the calculation of the breathing mode energy @xmath128",
    ", we evaluate the inverse energy - weighted sum rule @xmath65 with the constrained hartree - fock ( chf ) method and obtain the energy - weighted sum rule @xmath129 using the double commutator sum rule  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the optimization , we constrain the macroscopic parameters by requiring that ( i ) the neutron @xmath130 energy level splitting in @xmath1pb should lie in the range of @xmath131 mev ; ( ii)@xmath132 should be greater than @xmath133 and here we set @xmath134 ( @xmath135 is nucleon mass in vacuum ) to be consistent with the extraction from global nucleon optical potentials constrained by world data on nucleon - nucleus and ( p , n ) charge - exchange reactions  @xcite . as usual , in the optimization , we assign a theoretical error @xmath136 mev to e@xmath137 , @xmath138 fm to @xmath139 while use the experimental error for breathing mode energy @xmath140 with a weight factor @xmath141 , so that the respective @xmath142 evaluated from each sort of experimental data is roughly equal to the number of the corresponding data points  @xcite .    using the above optimization process , we evaluate the electric dipole polarizability @xmath20 in @xmath1pb as a function of @xmath3 for a fixed @xmath2 , and the results are shown in fig  [ alphadlc ] by solid up - triangles ( down - triangles ) for @xmath106 mev . it should be noted that for each pair of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with fixed values , the other @xmath105 macroscopic quantities have been optimized accordingly as described above .",
    "it is interesting to see that the values of @xmath20 with optimization are quite consistent with the results using the default values in msl0 without optimization and only show a small upward shift compared with the latter . comparing the results from optimization to the experimental data , one can obtain a constraint of @xmath6 mev , which is again in good agreement with the constraint @xmath110 mev extracted using the default values in msl0 .",
    "these features demonstrate the validity of neglecting the weak correlations between the @xmath20 in @xmath1pb and other @xmath105 macroscopic quantities .",
    "the present constraint on @xmath3 further agrees very well with the constraint @xmath143 mev extracted from analyzing the experimental data on the neutron skin thickness of sn isotopes  @xcite .",
    "this is a very interesting finding since these two constraints are obtained from two completely independent experimental observables .",
    "in addition , using the constrained @xmath2 and @xmath3 together with the corresponding @xmath105 other optimized quantities , one can easily extract the @xmath7 and @xmath144 at saturation density @xmath9 , and the results are @xmath145 mev and @xmath146 mev , which are essentially consistent with other constraints extracted from terrestrial experiments , astrophysical observations , and theoretical calculations with controlled uncertainties  @xcite . especially , our present results agree surprisingly well with the constraint of @xmath147-@xmath148 mev and @xmath149-@xmath150 mev ( at 95% confidence level ) obtained from analyzing the mass and radius of neutron stars  @xcite as well as that of @xmath151-@xmath152 mev and @xmath153-@xmath154 mev extracted from the experimental , theoretical and observational analyses  @xcite .",
    "our results are also in agreement with the constraint of @xmath155 mev and @xmath156 mev from analyzing pygmy dipole resonances ( pdr ) of @xmath157sn  @xcite and that of @xmath158 mev and @xmath159 mev from analyzing pdr of @xmath160ni and @xmath161sn  @xcite . in addition , our results are further consistent with the constraint of @xmath162 mev and @xmath163 mev extracted from analyzing the experimental data of the binding energy difference of heavy isotope pairs and the neutron skins of sn isotopes  @xcite as well as the constraint of @xmath164 mev and @xmath165 mev from a new finite - range droplet model analysis of the nuclear mass  @xcite .        given that the neutron skin thickness @xmath166 of @xmath1pb is uniquely fixed by the slope parameter @xmath3 at @xmath102 @xmath5  @xcite , we can also extract a constraint @xmath167 fm for @xmath1pb by using the optimized parameters together with @xmath103 mev and @xmath6 mev .",
    "our result is consistent with the estimated range @xmath168 fm in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained by analyzing the experimental @xmath20 in @xmath1pb with an empirical range of @xmath169 .",
    "one can see that our present constraint on @xmath166 of @xmath1pb has higher precision , indicating a more precise constraint on the symmetry energy at a subsaturation density is very helpful to extract @xmath166 of @xmath1pb from the electric dipole polarizability .",
    "our result further agrees with the constraint @xmath170 fm obtained from the @xmath1pb dipole polarizability by using an empirical correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath166 of @xmath1pb  @xcite , the constraint @xmath171 fm extracted very recently from coherent pion photoproduction cross sections  @xcite , and within the experimental error bar the constraint @xmath172 fm extracted from the prex at jlab  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been well established that the core - crust transition density @xmath173 in neutron stars , which plays a crucial role in neutron star properties  @xcite , is strongly correlated with the density slope @xmath12 of the symmetry energy ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same correlation analysis method as in this work has been successfully applied to study the correlation between @xmath173 and the various macroscopic quantities , and indeed a strong correlation between @xmath173 and @xmath12 has been found . as mentioned in ref .",

    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the electric dipole polarizability @xmath20 in @xmath1pb is sensitive to both the magnitude @xmath2 and density slope @xmath3 of the symmetry energy at a subsaturation cross density @xmath4 @xmath5 , and it decreases ( increases ) with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , leading to a positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 for a fixed value of @xmath20 in @xmath1pb . using the experimental value of @xmath20 in @xmath1pb measured at rcnp and the very well - constrained range of @xmath2 ,",
    "we have obtained a strong constraint on the slope parameter @xmath6 mev .",
    "this constraint is in surprisingly good agreement with the previous solely existing constraint @xmath143 mev from neutron skin data of sn isotopes , demonstrating the robustness of these constraints on the value of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "the present constraint of @xmath3 further leads to @xmath145 mev and @xmath178 mev for the symmetry energy at saturation density , the neutron skin thickness @xmath179 fm for @xmath1pb , and @xmath180 @xmath5 for the core - crust transition density of neutron stars .",
    "these results are nicely consistent with many other constraints extracted from terrestrial experiments , astrophysical observations , and theoretical calculations with controlled uncertainties .",
    "our present results are based on the standard shf energy density functional .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the results change if different energy - density functionals , e.g. , the relativistic mean field model or the extended non - standard shf energy density functional , are applied .",
