    "due to the inherent scarcity of frequency spectrum and increasing wireless traffic demands nowadays , frequency reuse has become an essential key technological issue associated with contemporary wireless communication systems .",
    "frequency reuse intrinsically causes interference between wireless links in not only homogeneous but also heterogeneous systems using the same frequency .",
    "accordingly , the state of the aggregate interference at an arbitrary position in the random node topology has become of great importance .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the interference of carrier sense multiple access / collision avoidance ( csma / ca ) networks . in particular , we analyze the aggregate interference in randomly deployed ieee 802.11 distributed coordination function ( dcf ) networks . from an understanding of the distribution of the aggregate interference at the protocol level , we can control this interference using the relationships discovered among the protocol parameters . to the best of our knowledge , there has been no massive test at the simulator level for the aggregate interference of csma / ca networks .",
    "thus , we test as well as analyze the interference at the protocol level .",
    "consequently , our goal in this study is to obtain the statistical inference of the aggregate interference and verify the results via simulations .",
    "most of the work previously done in this area focused on aloha - like systems in which the aggregate interference can be analyzed by assuming that transmitting nodes have independent locations and behaviors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although broadband cellular systems such as lte , lte - a , wcdma or its femto cell networks can also be modeled using this transmission - independent behavior , this is not a realistic assumption for csma / ca networks in which a certain interference level always needs to be maintained in a distributed manner . in a network of csma / ca nodes ,",
    "every communication entity first senses the ongoing transmission in the channel and then determines when to start transmitting .",
    "the inappropriateness of the independent model in such a scenario was noted in @xcite , in which the authors proposed the alternative dependent point process to mimic real csma / ca networks .",
    "however , this proposed point process still can not describe the dcf operation , in which collision and idle time , as well as successful transmission , can occur even in the exclusion area by carrier sense .",
    "compared with these previous research efforts , our work is the first to investigate the exact distribution of aggregate interference in csma / ca networks and to validate it by means of massive simulations .",
    "our paper has the following notable results :    * * owing to the possibility of concurrent transmission incurred by dcf operation occurring within an exclusion area , csma / ca random networks can only be modeled by the poisson point process ( ppp ) , not the dependent point process . *",
    "section [ sec : deppp ] addresses the difference between the dependent and independent point processes , and explains how real csma / ca networks can be dealt with . * * we derive the effective node density reflecting csma / ca mac layer operation .",
    "* section [ sec : mod_density ] explains this .",
    "this section is the core of our work since all the cross - layer parameters are coupled to model the network behavior .",
    "further , this is used in ppp shot noise analysis , which is the result of the first item .",
    "* * aggregate interference in ppp shot noise analysis using our derived effective node density is verified using the ns-2 network simulator and matlab simulations .",
    "* unlike other related theoretical analyses of stochastic geometry researches , we verify exactly how much our model reflects the ns-2 simulation results .",
    "we also compare our results with the matlab simulation on dependent point processes and thereby show that the ppp model with our new effective node density performs the best in modeling the aggregate interference .",
    "related issues are outlined in section [ sec : simul ] . *",
    "* the aggregate interference is either normal nor log - normal distributions * , as contrary to the most common assumption that the aggregate interference follows normal ( in dbm unit ) or log - normal ( in @xmath2 unit ) distributions .",
    "in this section , we focus on determining which type of point process is suitable for modeling csma / ca networks . a generic wireless network consisting of multiple randomly deployed nodes can be described via a point process . in the point process , a mark ( a scalar or a vector ) can be assigned to each point independently , which is useful for modeling node - oriented properties such as transmission power , medium access delay . in particular , the case where the number of nodes in a network is poisson - distributed and their positions at a given time instant are independent of each other , is adequately explained by means of the ppp .",
    "the method to derive the aggregate power emitted from points at an arbitrary position under independent marked ppp was previously studied as _ shot noise field _ , which was originally used to model the noise in electronic circuits in the time domain .",
    "however , the ppp approach as it currently exists may be insufficient to model the csma / ca .",
    "the reason is that the carrier sensing philosophy is not reflected in it .",
    "ppp is a typical _ independent _ point process in which the points are deployed independently of each other . on the other hand , in the carrier sensing operation , a sensing node always senses the shared medium and it delays its transmission once it senses that the medium is busy .",
    "the result is that active nodes are affected by each other , which means that the process is not independent .",
    "let us now consider the dependent point process as a possible alternative . here",
    ", the dependent point process means that some initially deployed points are discarded or selected by the metric related to the other points marks or locations .",
    "there are two dependent point processes most related to the modeling of csma / ca networks @xcite , @xcite : the matern hardcore ( mhc ) process and the simple sequential inhibition ( ssi ) point process . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors are also motivated by the inappropriateness of ppp , i.e. , the independence of points . in the paper , they compared the aggregate power distributions of ppp , mhc , and ssi with simulations , and concluded that ssi is the most appropriate one for modeling csma networks . however , their result is not fully acceptable because the operation they used in the simulation was not the real one but a modified version of a dependent point process based on ieee 802.15.4 phy parameters .",
    "more specifically , they neither considered any details of practical mac layer parameters nor channel characteristics . leaving this result aside , their mhc and ssi",
    "are fundamentally based on the hard exclusion area ; nevertheless , they contain ambiguities in the determination of this area .",
    "to further illustrate the issue , let us look at our simulation results .",
    "we simulated a realistic csma / ca network using ns-2 in order to observe the concurrent transmission behavior .",
    "[ fg : num_tx_exam ] shows our simulation topology and the effect on the distribution of the number of concurrent transmitting nodes . in the grid topology",
    ", the black dot represents the transmitter and the corresponding receiver is located at 5 ( m ) right and 5 ( m ) up away from its transmitter ; the receiver is omitted from the figure . in the simulation ,",
    "a 500 b payload was given to each transmitter and the traffic was saturated .",
    "the distance between the two nearest black dots was 50 ( m ) , and the carrier sensing ( cs ) threshold was tuned so that the resulting cs range was 70 ( m ) , derived using equation ( [ eq : effect_r ] ) .",
    "all other parameters were the same as those in table [ simul_ns2 ] .",
    "the large circle including set c nodes in the center denotes a cs area of the white dot ( one of the transmitters ) , while the smaller circle including set b nodes has a radius that is one half of the cs range .",
    "we depicts the relative time durations on the number of concurrent transmissions in each set in the bar plot .    in the graph ,",
    "two things are of note : first , there is a time period in which two nodes are concurrently transmitting when all transmitters are even in each other s cs area ( see the set b in the bar plot ) .",
    "second , there is a time period in which the medium is idle in the full cs area ( set c ) .",
    "the first case occurs due to cs failure or collision in real situation .",
    "mhc and ssi are fully _ dependent thinning _ of ppp with the exclusion area , and they can not model these events . the resulting effective node density of the dependent point process is likely to be lower than that of the real one .",
    "these approaches may work well in collision - less csma / ca networks where slot time is zero and backoff time is a continuous random variable ( rv ) @xcite , rather than real situations .",
    "the second case occurs due to the idle time from the binary exponential backoff ( beb ) and the dcf .",
    "this waste of time resource is the intrinsic cost of the distributed random access mac . in the dependent point process ,",
    "any point having none of the other points in its exclusion area always survives .",
    "the resulting effective node density of this process is likely to be higher than that of the real one . _ as a result , the real operation of a csma / ca network has both factors having higher and lower effective node density than that of the dependent point process .",
    "_ this difference is from the lack of mac layer operation modeling in the dependent point process .",
    "these collision events occur with a certain probability in real situations .",
    "this means that the concurrent transmission in an exclusion area occurs with some probability , not with deterministic patterns .",
    "this stochastic characteristic of real networks is appropriately modeled using the independent point process . therefore , we believe that a possible way to model a csma / ca network is again to use the independent ppp , but with a _",
    "new _ effective active node density reflecting mac layer operations .",
    "this is notable since recent research efforts such as @xcite and literatures therein point out that csma / ca can be modeled with mhc point process , which is different from our conclusion . at the very least",
    ", the aggregate power at an arbitrary position can be elaborated more when using ppp with a new effective node density rather than pure ppp or mhc / ssi .    for our analysis",
    ", we consider the infinite planar where the transmitting nodes are deployed randomly at positions specified by a poisson distribution with its intensity @xmath3 .",
    "each node transmits with a constant power @xmath4 .",
    "the radio channel attenuates with the pass - loss exponent @xmath5 and rayleigh fading .",
    "then we have cdf and pdf of the aggregate interference @xmath6 at an arbitrary receiver as follows @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a complementary error function .",
    "our idea is to use the above pdf and cdf again for calculating the aggregate interference of the csma / ca network , but with a new density @xmath9 , called _ effective active node density _ reflecting all the csma parameters .",
    "section iii is devoted to describing how we obtain @xmath9 , and its verification by massive ns-2 simulations is contained in section iv . for the readers who are more interested in our results , please directly jump to section iv .",
    "let us introduce a cs range @xmath1 so that a sensing node can sense any on - going transmission in this range .",
    "then within the disk of radius @xmath10 , every node senses each other .",
    "we set this disk as _ sharing area_.    cs is based on the threshold @xmath11 , i.e. , if the sensed power level at a sensing node is greater or lower than @xmath11 , a sensing node regards the channel is busy or idle , respectively .",
    "assuming there is only one interferer near the sensing node , the cs probability versus the distance to this interferer is calculated as followings :    @xmath12=\\mathbb{p}[\\frac{p_i}{r^4}+\\nu \\ge \\gamma],\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is a random variable ( rv ) representing the product of the fading effect and the constant transmission power from a typical node @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the distance between the sensing node and the interferer , and @xmath16 is the receiver noise power . considering rayleigh fading , @xmath13 follows @xmath17 with a constant transmission power @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , with the cs range @xmath1 , we convert the stochastic cs to a deterministic one .",
    "first , the average sensing area is calculated by integrating the parts of the circumference , of which the radius and the center are @xmath15 and the sensing node , respectively .",
    "the cs probability of a point on this circumference is from : @xmath18 { \\rm{d}}r \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_0^\\infty 2\\pi r e^{-\\frac{1}{p}(\\gamma-\\nu)r^4 } { \\rm{d}}r \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\pi^{3/2}}{2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma-\\nu}{p}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming that the deterministic cs region should have the same average sensing area ( sensing resolution ) as the stochastic cs , the following equation is derived : @xmath19 finally , we get the cs distance @xmath1 as follows : @xmath20 by this deterministic cs distance , which we will call _ effective carrier sensing range _ , the interference is regarded as boolean at a given distance rather than stochastic .",
    "let us consider an infinite plane with the nodes randomly deployed .",
    "suppose an arbitrary disk having of radius @xmath0 in the plane ( sharing area ) , where every nodes in this area can sense other nodes transmissions by the definition of cs range @xmath1 . by ppp ,",
    "the number of deployed nodes in the sharing area follows poisson distribution with the parameter @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22=\\frac{\\{\\lambda\\pi ( \\frac{r}{2})^2\\}^n}{n!}\\exp(-\\lambda\\pi ( \\frac{r}{2})^2)\\ ] ]    once we know @xmath23 $ ] , we will derive the probability on the number of active nodes , @xmath24 in the sharing area @xmath25 $ ] and the power distribution at an arbitrary time instant in the sharing area .",
    "these will be explained in the following subsections . for the purpose ,",
    "let us define the following probability : * definition 1 .",
    "* @xmath26 is the probability that there are on - going transmissions in a given sharing area at a certain time .",
    "consider the ieee 802.11 dcf protocol for csma / ca mac .",
    "if all the transmitting nodes can sense each other in a sharing area and the given traffic to each node is a saturated one , we know the steady - state behavior in this area . as shown in @xcite and subsequent research efforts , the backoff stage of each node in the network is random at a certain time and this can be elaborated through a two - dimensional markov chain .",
    "we have two main quantities for addressing this : @xmath27 is the probability that the collision happens conditioned on the transmission of each node , and @xmath28 is the transmission probability of a node at a randomly chosen time slot .",
    "these two quantities are derived by finding the steady - state solution of the discrete time markov chain .    by following the notations of @xcite",
    ", we have the beb dynamics with @xmath29 maximum backoff stage , @xmath30 maximum retry limit and @xmath31 initial window size . the probability @xmath28 that a node transmits in a randomly chosen time slot",
    "is :    l[eq : tau ] = \\{+-}^-1 .",
    "again , @xmath27 is obtained through :    @xmath32    where @xmath24 is the number of active ( contending ) nodes .",
    "we can solve the system dynamics by solving two independent equations and and the existence of this solution is guaranteed by the fixed point theorem @xcite .",
    "since we know @xmath28 , we can obtain the steady state power density .",
    "the probability that @xmath14 nodes transmit simultaneously at an arbitrary time slot , given that @xmath24 transmitting nodes are deployed in a sharing area is : @xmath33=\\binom{a}{m}\\tau^m(1-\\tau)^{a - m}\\nonumber\\\\ m={0,\\dots , a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each transmitting node s operation in a sharing area is synchronized since the medium is sensed perfectly and every node has the inner clock .",
    "thus , idle time is also segmented into multiple slot times ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , all events ( idle time slot , successful and collision time slot ) can be distinguished by their durations . at an arbitrary time",
    ", the sharing area medium is in one of three events and we call this random time slot as the _ virtual time slot_. the virtual time slot has the random duration @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the payload size is the same as @xmath36 for all nodes . in basic mode ,",

    "once the transmission starts , irrespective of success or not , the packet of size @xmath44 is transmitted first .",
    "and then the remaining parts ( @xmath45 or @xmath40 ) are determined according to the existence of collision . of course",
    ", in rts - cts mode , successful slot time and collision slot time will be changed into @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the duration of rts and cts packet , respectively .",

    "the distribution of the number of concurrent transmissions ( which is also the power distribution ) is based on this pmf . in each virtual slot , the number of concurrent transmissions is various from 0 to @xmath24 . and",
    "even when the number of concurrent transmitting nodes are given , the virtual slot consists of nobody transmission portion and somebody transmission portion . in the basic mode , nobody transmits during @xmath34 . during @xmath38 and @xmath40 in the both of successful and collision slot time , nobody transmits , too . during packet transmission time",

    "we ignored the propagation delay , even though this exists in the simulator , since the value was quite small compared to the other transmission times .",
    "a generated traffic of 5,000,000 packets per second ( pps ) was given to all the transmitters .",
    "this means a value of 0.2 ( @xmath87s ) for inter - arrival time from the application layer to the physical layer , which is less than the whole transmission time for one successful packet , i.e. , @xmath88 , which is enough for the traffic to be saturated .",
    "all @xmath26 in this subsection refer to @xmath62 , the final solution of @xmath26 for simplicity of expression . in fig .",
    "[ fg : pon ] , @xmath26 are shown for various combinations of mac parameters .",
    "the factor that affects @xmath26 the most is the effective cs distance @xmath1 , followed by @xmath3 , the initial node density . as @xmath3 increases , @xmath26 naturally increases due to the increased congestion level with semi - log style trend .",
    "if there is only the reduced idle time factor without increasing collision probability , as in @xcite s ideal csma , the rate of increase of @xmath26 must be a log function style .",
    "however , our model reflects the increased collision probability and reduced idle time simultaneously , as obtained in real situations .",
    "the resulting @xmath26 shows a mixture of linear and log functions . within the same @xmath1 ,",
    "the combination of mode and payload size that has the lowest @xmath26 is the rts mode and short payload . in other words ,",
    "the order of @xmath89 is for lower @xmath26 . in general , rts - cts mode has a lower congestion level than the basic mode since the system cost was only the rts - cts packet collision and the waiting time for retransmission compared to the basic mode .",
    "a large payload in the basic mode makes for a higher congestion level .",
    "however , in the cases of some @xmath3 values , rts - cts packets were small enough to compensate for the payload size .",
    "therefore basic-500b might have higher @xmath26 than rts-1000b . in this case ,",
    "the effect of mode was weaker than that of the payload size .",
    "this @xmath26 was used in the new density @xmath9 and we plotted this as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : new_density ] .",
    "this figure shows that the smaller @xmath1 makes for a higher @xmath9 , which is the opposite case to @xmath26 .",
    "this is understandable since a smaller @xmath1 signifies more insensitivity to the interference around .",
    "therefore , we expected the result of @xmath90 , the aloha system , to approach the line @xmath91 in the figure .",
    "this line also represents wireless access systems that have no mac , such as macro or femto cellular systems .",
    "the curve @xmath9 is a version of @xmath3 filtered by the csma / ca and beb mechanism . by showing the @xmath91 line and the curves together , fig .",
    "[ fg : new_density ] also addresses how large the gap between these two node densities is and how effectively csma / ca mac operates .",
    "the bold curves are from : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the exclusion distance with an ambiguity . for comparison",
    ", we put @xmath1 into @xmath93 in this figure .",
    "this expression is the approximated node density for modeling mhc adopted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the variation of @xmath9 is higher than @xmath94 for varying @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath94 is used for modeling dependent point processes , it can not trace the real operation .",
    "as shown in the next section , our aggregate power distribution adopting this @xmath9 is the most elaborate among other point processes . therefore , fig .",
    "[ fg : new_density ] shows the gap in aggregate interference between simplified mhc and the real situation .",
    "this is significant because this simplified mhc expression is widely used in academia @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the pdf and cdf of the analysis in each node density showed high correlations with those of the ns-2 simulations , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : pdf1 ] and [ fg : cdf1 ] .",
    "we depict all the pdfs in a log scale .",
    "although at first glance they resemble a log - normal distribution , they are asymmetric based on the main lobe .",
    "therefore , they are definitely neither normal nor log - normal distributions .",
    "this is notable as some research efforts in the signal processing field assume that the aggregate interference follows normal ( in dbm unit ) or log - normal ( in @xmath2 unit ) distributions . for the other features , the higher the mean of the aggregate power , the lower the probability of that mean value .",
    "therefore , low - mean high - probability and high - mean low - probability patterns are shown in all the results .",
    "this is because the total sum of the probability is fixed to 1 and the x - axis is log - scaled and not linear .",
    "compared with dependent point processes , at any given @xmath3 value , our analysis is the closest one to the simulation results , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fg : pdf0001 ] and fig .",
    "[ fg : pdf0005 ] . the interference of mhc ( matern)is always less than that of ssi since mhc is the lower bound of ssi , which is also commented on in @xcite .",
    "however , these two are not as sensitive as our model to variations in node density .",
    "moreover , these two do not have sufficient mac and phy layer parameters to reflect the real situation , while our analysis can model any combination of the system parameters , as in fig .",
    "[ fg : pdf_mac ] .    as shown in the figures so far",
    ", our model of the interference has slightly lower values than that of the simulation in each case .",
    "this is mainly because the simulator allows the _ capture _ situation . in our analysis ,",
    "the collision between transmitters is regarded as a failure of transmission and this increases each collided nodes backoff stages . in contrast",
    ", there might be a successful transmission even when multiple nodes in a cs area are transmitting at the same time .",
    "this is because if the ratio of one incoming signal to the others is guaranteed to be higher than a certain threshold , this stronger incoming signal can always be decoded . in our analysis",
    ", we ignored that situation in order to simplify the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , our result is competitive .    from these results , we learned the following lessons :",
    "if the network is required to maintain a lower interference than a certain level , there are multiple combinations of parameters that need to be controlled . since the pdf of the aggregate interference is a function of @xmath9 , there are multiple combinations of parameters that can result in the same value of @xmath9 .",
    "those controllable parameters are @xmath1 , transmission mode , payload size , etc .",
    "this can be used for the interference management in uncontrolled interference limited systems such as cognitive radio networks .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the aggregate interference from randomly deployed csma / ca nodes .",
    "csma / ca mac operations on the stochastic geometry makes the understanding of a node s behavior difficult .",
    "however , the homogeneity of ppp provides a clue to solving the problem .",
    "we derived the effective active node density by spatially quantizing the infinite space and analyzing the steady - state power distribution on this quantization unit .",
    "verification is also nontrivial since much repetition is needed in order to get sound statistical inference from the random topology .",
    "although the exact closed form expression of the interference distribution can not be obtained , the analysis framework proposed in this paper shows high applicability to many related problems in modern wireless networks where the amount of interference in a random node geometry significantly affects system performance .",
    "the power distributions @xmath96 of and are conditioned on @xmath24 , while @xmath24 is conditioned on @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the marginal pmf of @xmath26 is obtained by summing all of the probabilities on conditioned variables , as in .",
    "the condition on @xmath24 is eliminated using . the condition on @xmath97",
    "is eliminated by the homogeneity of ppp , i.e. , every geometric subset satisfies poisson distribution on the number of points in that subset , i.e. , .    in",
    ", @xmath98 is from the fact that the possibility of a sharing area being  on \" is zero when there is no initial deployed nodes and active nodes .",
    "@xmath99 is from and .",
    "@xmath100 is from . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath101 includes @xmath26 term , which is also the marginal pmf from the unconditional event of channel busyness .",
    "therefore , equation has the unknown variable @xmath26 on both sides of the equation and the solution can be obtained by solving the weighted eighth order polynomial of @xmath26 , where the weight is the product form of poisson and binomial probabilities .",
    "more specifically , @xmath102 is the eighth - order polynomial of the unknown @xmath26 and all other terms are known , and @xmath103 is a constant from poisson distribution for the given @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , summing the product of these two terms for varying @xmath76 from @xmath104 to @xmath105 also results in an eighth - order polynomial .",
    "since there is no general solution for polynomials with order higher than four and @xmath76 goes to infinity , we can not derive the closed form expression of @xmath62 , the solution of @xmath26 .",
