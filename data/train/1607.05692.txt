    "frustration is a common feature in complex physical systems since it generally characterizes competing needs that are impossible to be fulfilled simultaneously .",
    "it is not a phenomenon that , per se , is connected to the quantum nature in our world .",
    "frustration is to all of us a known experience if an obstacle prevents the satisfaction of desire . even in the jurisdiction definitions of frustration",
    "can be found . in strong contrast",
    "to entanglement that is lacking in a classical world .",
    "it can lead to correlations that are stronger than those that can be generated with classical systems .",
    "two particles can share information that is stored in the whole system but is not available in the separated systems .",
    "even stronger for multipartite systems sharing of information of two particles limits the share of information with other particles ( monogamy ) , there is a trade off of shared information . though both phenomena are distinct properties of systems , they are not unrelated , revealing the interplay for many particle systems is the focus of this paper .    in the last years researches have developed several toolboxes to compute the local and global ground states of physical systems consisting of many particles exposed to different interactions  @xcite . with this progress",
    "the computation of entanglement , defined onto states given a certain subalgebra structure , has become a possible enterprise .",
    "indeed , for a plethora of models entanglement in many body systems has been shown to play a fundamental role ( for an overview see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for instance the area law  @xcite is one that allows to understand the emergent of topologically ordered phases of matter  @xcite .",
    "entanglement explains the local thermalization  @xcite or the selection of a particular subset of states from a huge ground state space  @xcite .",
    "even the absence of entanglement gives a strong insight into the type of macroscopic phases that are realized  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the standard density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) algorithm , also known as matrix product formalism , allows to relate properties as polymerisation to entanglement  @xcite by reordering the particles . however , also more refined quantities can be introduced . in ref .",
    "@xcite macroscopic observables capable in detecting ( genuine ) multipartite entanglement have been shown to work , including non - zero temperatures . here , the authors compared the minimal energy of ground states to the minimal energy when optimised over the set of states with particular entanglement features .",
    "if both minimal energies do not overlap , then clearly there is entanglement in the game .",
    "this entanglement - energy gap witnesses via the macroscopic observable , energy , the presence of multipartite entanglement .",
    "most works have so far focussed on the analysis of frustration originating from the impossibility for a many - body system to satisfy all the energy constraints simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "recent works  @xcite have introduced a measure of frustration that allows to tackle both the frustration originating of classical ( geometric ) or quantum sources . in particular , extending the classical toulouse condition a set of inequalities bounded by entanglement was put forward .",
    "if we think of maximally entangled states in the context of quantum information theory they differ only in their local information , in the choice of the reference system .",
    "they describe the same resource of information . therefore , any proper entanglement measure has to assign the same value to each one of those .",
    "complex many bodies are characterized by shaping different orders .",
    "thus frustration marks a difference between the particular realization of configurations .",
    "immediately , the question arises how frustration and entanglement interplay ? despite growing interest in entanglement in condensed matter systems , up to our best knowledge this question has not been tackled and it presents the main aim of this contribution .    for",
    "that we introduce a family of hamiltonians with short- and long - ranged interactions and two - body heisenberg - like interactions ( section  [ family ] ) .",
    "then we start the analysis by having only one antiferromagnetic interaction turned on .",
    "this leads to separable local ground states for which obviously the entanglement is zero ( section  [ withoutentanglement ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the case when interactions in all three spatial directions are turned on ( section  [ withentanglement ] ) .",
    "in particular we find a continuity in the behaviour going from short- to long - ranged interactions , though huge differences in the properties of local and global ground states are present .",
    "this in turn makes our family of hamiltonians a rich research object allowing us some general conclusions about the interplay between frustration and entanglement ( section  [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "our family of many body systems undergoes two - body heisenberg - like interactions on a one - dimensional ring of an even number @xmath0 of spin-@xmath1 particles with periodic boundary conditions . for sake of generality",
    "we consider systems invariant under spatial translations and only distance depending interactions are considered .",
    "given these constraints the hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 are the standard pauli operators defined on the @xmath5-th spin of the one - dimensional ring with periodic boundary condition ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath7 are the anisotropies in the different spatial directions .",
    "since the different spatial directions are interchangeable , without loss of generality , we may fix @xmath8 and consider the behaviour of the system varying only the anisotropies @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the interval @xmath11 $ ] .    for this parameter space",
    "we observe three different local ground states of any pair of spins @xmath12 , namely for @xmath13 an antisymmetric maximally entangled state , @xmath14 , and for the opposite case @xmath15 a symmetric maximally entangled state , @xmath16 , whereas for @xmath17 we have a twofold degenerated local ground state which projector is the sum of the projectors of the two above maximally entangled states ( these two maximally entangled states are two out of the four so called bell states defined in eq .  [ bellstates ] ) .",
    "the distance between two particles @xmath5 and @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 .",
    "the strength of the distance depending interactions are modelled by @xmath20 . for @xmath21 all spins are interacting with all other ones with the same strength , thus this is the infinite - ranged interaction case .",
    "the other extreme case is obtained for @xmath22 , where we basically have only nearest neighbour interactions , i.e. a short - ranged interactions . in - between we have the long - ranged interactions .",
    "we have also for some cases tested an exponential function for the distance @xmath19 rather than the above polynomial .",
    "we have not observed any qualitative difference .",

    "for @xmath24 the frustration value is diverging , whereas for @xmath25 it reaches a finite value .",
    ", width=283 ]    we start the analyzes of frustration for the family of hamiltonians  ( [ generalhamiltonian ] ) by first discussing the case with the choices @xmath26 .",
    "this is an antiferromagnetic ising model with short - range or long - range interactions modeled by the parameter @xmath20 @xmath27 the local ground states ( tracing out the remaining spins ) and the global ground states can be analytically derived . to compute frustration",
    "we explore the quantity introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . independently of the interaction strength @xmath20 any pair of spins @xmath12 occupies a two - fold degenerated hilbert space which is spanned by two separable states @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , the projector onto the local ground space is given by @xmath30 the global ground state @xmath31 is always degenerated .",
    "in contrast to the local ground states , however , the global ground states depend on the strength @xmath20 of the interacting spin pairs . in the computation of the frustration the degeneracy of the hilbertspace",
    "is taken into account by a kind of thermodynamic mixtures , i.e. all possible ground states are mixed with equal probabilities . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this obtained maximally mixed ground state and all substates conserve all the symmetries of the hamiltonian under investigation .",
    "thus they represent the system s properties accordingly  @xcite .",
    "the quantity measuring frustration of a pair of spins @xmath12 is then defined by @xmath32 and gives in our case @xmath33 where the last equality holds because our model is invariant under spin inversions .",
    "since the global ground state is alternating between up and down states so called nel states the number of states in the state @xmath34 depends on the distance between the spins ( strictly speaking only for @xmath35 ) .",
    "the state for any two spins @xmath12 tracing out any other spins is for odd distances @xmath36 with @xmath37 @xmath38 or for even distances @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xmath41 frustration @xmath42 does therefore have a dependence on the distance between the spins : in the odd case the number of states @xmath43 is zero ( @xmath44 ) and in the even case the number of states @xmath43 is maximal ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "consequently , independent of the strength @xmath20 the frustration quantity @xmath42 attains the two dichotomic values @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "however , we want to have a quantity that is also sensitive to the distance s strength @xmath20 , therefor we define the following function @xmath48 this function weights each frustration between any two spins by the strength and the distance . in case",
    "the number of spins in the chain @xmath0 is an integer multiple of @xmath49 , we find @xmath50 whereas for @xmath51 with @xmath37 we obtain @xmath52 in the thermodynamic limit both functions should coincide which is indeed the case , the characteristic frustration of the system becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the riemann zeta function . only in the case of @xmath55 the riemann zeta function is converting to a finite value . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we have plotted our characteristic frustration function for different @xmath20 and @xmath0 . as can be observed for @xmath55 the frustration has a finite value with increasing @xmath20 it converges to zero .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath24 the value diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us further discuss this case by looking closer to the limiting case of @xmath21 , i.e. all spins are equally interacting with any spin independently of the distance . in this case the spins can be reordered arbitrarily as long half of all spins are taking to be spin up and the other half is spin down .",
    "in the ground space we have therefore @xmath56 possibilities , thus the degeneracy of the ground state space grows exponentially . at first sight",
    "one would assume that the reduced density matrices become inaccessible , however , since all possible global ground states are mixed equally , tracing out leads to an analytic density matrix .",
    "the number of states for which any two spins are in the state @xmath57 is giving by fixing these two spins and a variation over all possibilities for the remaining spins obeying the total @xmath58 structure @xmath59 dividing this number by all possible global ground states derived above , we find the frustration of any pair of spins to be dependent on the length of the chain @xmath0 @xmath60 notably this function does not exceed @xmath61 . now computing our characteristic frustration function  ( [ characteristicfrustration_general ] )",
    "we find @xmath62 it is extremely notable that this function can be also obtained from eq .",

    "( [ characteristicfrustration2 ] ) by performing the limit @xmath63 .",
    "this fact implies a consistency and a continuity of @xmath64 even if the behaviour of the degree of degeneracy of the ground state space is exponential .",

    "the local grounds states are still maximally entangled , but via the antisymmetric bell state @xmath68 . above the dotted curves , depending on the size @xmath0 , the family of hamiltonians lead to non - degenerated global ground state , whereas the remaining region posses degenerated global ground states . in particular in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the global ground state is degenerated only in the case of both parameter @xmath65 being negative . ]",
    "now we proceed by considering also non - zero values of the @xmath69- and @xmath70-interaction in addition to the one in @xmath71 ( fixed with @xmath8 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is obviously no longer decomposable into local commuting ones .",
    "these models are no longer analytically solvable , thus we developed a numerical approach for finite size models ( lanczos algorithm ) from which we extrapolate to the thermodynamical case .",
    "in general we expect that frustration can have contributions from a classical , geometrical source ( competing interactions as in the first case analyzed ) , however , also contributions from the quantum feature `` entanglement '' .",
    "our aim is to understand this origin . due to the symmetries of the interaction terms",
    "the local ground states of two spins are generally maximally entangled states , i.e. one out of the four so called bell states latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{bellstates }     with the antiferromagnetic interaction turned on ( @xmath8 ) the antisymmetric bell state @xmath73 with total spin zero or the symmetric bell state @xmath74 with total spin one is favoured ( basis choice @xmath71-basis ) .",
    "for entanglement theory those four ( two ) bell states do not differ in their entanglement property since they are connected by local unitaries .",
    "in particular any basis of maximally entangled states may be constructed out of one seed state by then applying in one subsystem unitaries ( pauli matrices or generally weyl operators ) .",
    "this general property has been utilized in discussing separability properties extensively or are relevant in experimental realizations of mixed states  @xcite . for the discussion here it is important to note that the amount of entanglement ( measured by any proper entanglement measure ) is the same for both bell states @xmath75 under investigation since they differ only by a local unitary operation , e.g. @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "the aim is now to show how the local - to - global properties of the system under investigation influence each other .",
    "rotating locally the hamiltonian  ( [ generalhamiltonian ] ) along the @xmath71-axis leads to local rotations of the pauli - matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in particular for the case @xmath78 , if we apply to @xmath79 spin particles such a @xmath71-rotation we can change the sign of @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively . thus there exists a bijective map between models above and below the symmetry line @xmath80 .",

    "we choose even number of spins such that the frustration of classical origin can be assumed to be zero ( see previous section ) , consequently being only sensitive to frustration originating from entanglement .",
    "but since there is no long - range interaction , we have no competing forces , but since frustration is still finite ( see fig .  [ figure4 ] ) we conclude it is of quantum origin .    in strong contrast to the other limiting case of long - ranged interactions ( @xmath81 ) . here",

    "surprisingly , we find that the values of our characteristic frustration function are depending on @xmath0 but not on the specific values of @xmath65 and is given by @xmath102 and thus frustration takes values form @xmath95 ( @xmath103 ) to @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
