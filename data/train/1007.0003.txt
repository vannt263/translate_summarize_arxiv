    "the bimodality of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) durations @xcite is indicative of separate progenitor populations for long- and short - duration grbs . while direct observational support exists for the massive star origin of long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the most popular progenitor model for short grbs",
    "is the coalescence of compact object binaries with neutron star and/or black hole constituents ( ns - ns / ns - bh ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the key predictions of this model is that some systems will experience large velocity kicks at birth , leading to eventual mergers well outside of the host galaxies , in galactic halos and the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "these models predict that @xmath20 of all mergers will occur at offsets of @xmath21 kpc for milky way mass galaxies . in such environments the resulting afterglow emission",
    "is expected to be fainter than for bursts occurring in coincidence with their host galaxies due to the low ambient density @xcite .",
    "a subset of ns - ns binaries ( @xmath22 ) may be formed dynamically in globular clusters @xcite , leading to possible large offsets and low ambient densities despite an absence of kicks .",
    "the distribution of offsets for such binary systems can in principle be calculated from the spatial distribution of globular clusters , and initial predictions are that @xmath23 of these systems will have offsets of @xmath21 kpc ( depending on the mass of the galaxy ; @xcite ) .",
    "an additional expectation is that dynamically - formed binaries will be heavily skewed to lower redshifts due to the additional time delay between the formation and core - collapse of the globular clusters @xcite .",
    "other progenitor systems for short grbs have also been proposed , including young magnetars @xcite , accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of neutron stars @xcite , and delayed magnetar formation through binary white dwarf mergers or white dwarf aic @xcite .",
    "these models are partially motivated by observations that can not be easily accommodated in the standard ns - ns merger model , such as extended soft @xmath0-ray emission on timescales of @xmath24 s ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by phenomena such as short - duration giant flares from soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the general expectation is that these alternative progenitors will not experience kicks , and will therefore lead to bursts in coincidence with host galaxies .",
    "the detection of short grb afterglows starting in mid-2005 provided an opportunity to investigate the various progenitor models through a range of observational tests : the redshift distribution @xcite , the host galaxy demographics @xcite , the afterglow properties @xcite , and perhaps most importantly , their locations relative to the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "as of mid-2010 , x - ray and optical afterglows have been detected from 40 and 20 short grbs , respectively , with the latter sample providing accurate sub - arcsecond positions .",
    "of these 20 events , 15 directly coincide with host galaxies with a wide distribution of apparent magnitudes , and redshifts of @xmath25 or beyond ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the remaining five events do not appear to coincide with galaxies , and therefore provide an opportunity to assess the possibility of large progenitor offsets , and to test the validity of the ns - ns merger models .",
    "significant offsets have been claimed previously , in particular for grbs 050509b and 060502b with projected offsets of @xmath26 and @xmath27 kpc , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , in both cases only x - ray positions are available ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 radius , respectively ) , and the error circles contain several galaxies consistent with a negligible offset @xcite . moreover , in the case of grb050509b the x - ray error circle intersected the outer regions of the host , raising the possibility that the progenitor system was formed in , rather than kicked to , the outskirts of the host . this possibility raises a crucial point , namely that a substantial physical offset from the center of the host does not necessarily point to a progenitor kick if the burst still closely coincides with the host light distribution @xcite .",
    "an illustrative example of this point is grb071227 whose optical afterglow position coincides with the outskirts of edge - on disk galaxies , with an offsets of about 15 kpc from the host center @xcite .",
    "large offsets have also been speculated in a few cases with precise optical afterglow positions ( grbs 061201 , 070809 , and 080503 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these claims have not been investigated systematically , mainly because they were treated on a case - by - case basis , with probabilistic arguments that prevented conclusive associations .",
    "these cases , combined with the ambiguity inherent to x - ray positions , demonstrate that bursts with optical afterglows are essential for reaching any robust conclusions about progenitor offsets ( due to kicks and/or a globular cluster origin ) .    here",
    "we present the first systematic study of short grbs with optical afterglows and no coincident hosts , which combines their afterglow properties with the large - scale environments .",
    "the purpose of this study is to statistically assess the possibility of offsets and to compare this with alternative explanations ( e.g. , a high redshift origin ) . to achieve this goal we set our study in the broader context of short grbs that have optical afterglows _ and _ coincident hosts , as well as short grbs with only x - ray positions .",
    "as we demonstrate throughout the paper , such a combined study is essential since offsets or high redshifts are expected to jointly affect both the afterglow properties and the large - scale environments .",
    "our study also provides a robust statistical assessment of _ a posteriori _ chance coincidence probabilities , and the expected number of spurious associations , which can not be properly assessed for individual bursts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we present deep optical observations of the environments of grbs 061201 , 070809 , 080503 , 090305 , and 090515 , as well as spectroscopic observations of bright galaxies near the burst positions for grbs 061201 , 070809 , and 090515 .",
    "we study trends in the afterglow and prompt emission properties of bursts with and without coincident hosts in  [ sec : ag ] , and determine _ a posteriori _ probabilities of chance coincidence as a function of projected angular offset for galaxies near the position of each burst in ",
    "[ sec : hosts ] .",
    "we also determine projected physical and host - normalized offsets , and use these in conjunction with the afterglow and prompt emission properties to address two scenarios for the short bursts with optical emission and no coincident bright hosts : ( i ) an origin in faint galaxies at @xmath12 (  [ sec : highz ] ) , or ( ii ) substantial offsets from galaxies at @xmath30 or @xmath7 (  [ sec : kick ] ) . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we present the offset distribution of all short grbs with optical afterglows ( in the context of scenario ii ) , and compare this distribution with predictions for ns - ns kicks and dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries .",
    "we further investigate whether the circumburst densities that are required for the measured optical magnitudes can be accommodated with a halo or igm origin .",
    "we draw conclusions about the progenitors of short grbs from our systematic study in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we include in this investigation all 20 short grbs with optical afterglow detections as of june 2010 .",
    "this is the full subset of events for which sub - arcsecond positions are available .",
    "we stress that this sample represents only about 1/3 of all short grbs discovered to date , and about 1/2 of the sample with x - ray afterglow detections .",
    "thus , it is not a complete sample of short grbs , but it is the only subset for which we can investigate the possibility of large offsets with meaningful statistical significance . as we demonstrate in  [ sec : disc ] , we do not expect this sample to be strongly biased with respect to circumburst density , at least for @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "the properties of the 20 short grbs , as well as events with deep optical limits , are summarized in table  [ tab : shbs ] .",
    "as can be inferred from the table , some of the 20 events with only x - ray detections do not have optical follow - up observations , suggesting that the sample with optical afterglows may be largely representative .",
    "for the purpose of our investigation we define three sub - samples that will be used throughout the paper : ( i ) _ sample 1 _ : short grbs with detected afterglows and coincident host galaxies ( 15 bursts ) ; ( ii ) _ sample 2 _ : the 5 short bursts with detected optical afterglows and no bright coincident hosts ; and ( iii ) _ sample 3 _ : short grbs with detected x - ray afterglows ( from the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ) but no optical detections despite rapid follow - up observations ( 11 bursts ) .      for the bursts in _ sample 2 _ we use deep space- and",
    "ground - based optical observations to place limits on the brightness of underlying galaxies , and to assess the probability of chance coincidence for nearby galaxies .",
    "for grb061201 we use _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observations obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the f814w filter , with a total exposure time of 2244 s @xcite . for grb070809",
    "we use @xmath33-band observations obtained on 2008 january 14 ut with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) mounted on the magellan / clay 6.5-m telescope , with a total exposure time of 1500 s. for grb080503 we use hst wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) observations in the f606w filter from 2009 january 30 ut , with a total exposure time of 4000 s @xcite .",
    "we also use the limits on a coincident host inferred from a deeper stack of hst observations by @xcite , with @xmath34 mag . for grb090305",
    "we use ldss3 @xmath33-band observations obtained on 2010 may 8 ut with a total exposure time of 2400 s. finally , for grb090515 we use @xmath33-band observations obtained with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) mounted on the gemini - north 8-m telescope from 2009 may 15 ut with a total exposure time of 1800 s.    the ground - based observations were reduced and analyzed using standard routines in iraf .",
    "the analysis of the hst observations is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the limiting magnitudes for all five observations are listed in table  [ tab : nohost ] , and images of the five fields are shown in figures  [ fig:061201][fig:090515 ] .",
    "in addition to the imaging observations , we obtained spectroscopic observations of galaxies near the positions of grbs 061201 , 070809 , and 090515 .",
    "our observations of a galaxy located @xmath35 from the afterglow position of grb061201 ( marked `` s4 '' in figure  [ fig:061201 ] ) revealed a star forming galaxy at @xmath36 @xcite ; see figure  [ fig:061201spec ] .    for grb070809 we obtained spectra of two galaxies located @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the optical afterglow position ( marked `` s2 '' and `` s3 '' , respectively in figure  [ fig:070809 ] ) using ldss3 on 2008 january 14 ut .",
    "the galaxy at a separation of @xmath37 was previously identified as a star forming galaxy at @xmath39 by @xcite . here",
    "we find that the object at a separation of @xmath38 is an early - type galaxy at @xmath40 , with no evidence for on - going star formation activity ( figure  [ fig:070809spec ] ) .",
    "finally , for grb090515 we obtained multi - object spectroscopic observations with ldss3 for nearly 100 galaxies within a @xmath41 field centered on the grb position .",
    "these observations provide redshifts for several galaxies near the host position , including a star forming galaxy at @xmath42 ( @xmath43 offset ; `` s1 '' in figure  [ fig:090515 ] ) , an early - type galaxy at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 offset ;  s5  ) , and a star forming galaxy at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 offset ; `` s6 '' ) ; see figure  [ fig:090515spec ] . in an upcoming paper",
    "we will demonstrate that the galaxy at @xmath44 is a member of a cluster .",
    "we begin our investigation by assessing the distribution of optical afterglow magnitudes for the three samples defined in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the observed magnitudes and limits as a function of time after the burst are shown in figure  [ fig : optag1 ] .",
    "the median observation time for the sample is about 8.5 hr after the burst .",
    "the distribution of detected optical afterglow magnitudes is broad , ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 mag .",
    "the limits range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 mag ( with the exception of grb080702 which only has a shallow limit of about 21 ab mag : @xcite ) .",
    "the mean brightness and standard deviation for _ sample 1 _ are @xmath52 mag .",
    "this is substantially fainter , by about an order of magnitude , than the afterglows of long grbs on a comparable timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also remarkably similar to the prediction of @xmath53 mag at @xmath54 hr by @xcite .",
    "since the available limits are at least @xmath55 mag , we conclude that the bursts lacking optical detections are drawn from a population with fainter afterglows .",
    "for the 5 bursts in _ sample 2 _ we find a median and standard deviation of @xmath56 mag , about 1.4 mag fainter than the bursts with coincident hosts .",
    "the cumulative distributions for the three samples normalized to the fiducial time of @xmath57 hr after the burst are shown in figure  [ fig : optag2 ] .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that there is only an @xmath58 probability that _ sample 1 _ and _ sample 2 _ are drawn from the same underlying distribution of optical afterglow brightnesses .",
    "similarly , the probability that _ sample 1 _ and _ sample 3 _ are drawn from the same underlying distribution is @xmath59 ( an upper limit since the bursts in _ sample 3 _ are not detected in the optical ) .",
    "on the other hand , the probability that _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3 _ are drawn from the same underlying distribution is high , @xmath60 .",
    "the overall faintness of the optical afterglows in _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3 _ can be explained in two primary ways .",
    "first , they could result from systematically lower circumburst densities . in the standard afterglow model with @xmath61 , the afterglow flux scales as @xmath62 for a uniform medium @xcite .",
    "thus , a difference of about @xmath63 mag can be explained with a density that is about an order of magnitude lower than for the bursts in _",
    "sample 1_.    alternatively , the fainter fluxes may be due to higher redshifts for _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3 _ compared to _",
    "sample 1 _ since the optical flux also scales as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the @xmath63 mag difference corresponds to @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for a _ sample 1 _ mean redshift of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "similarly , the flux also depends on the total energy , with @xmath70 , and therefore a difference of @xmath63 mag can be explained with an energy release lower by about a factor of 3 .    the various scenarios ( lower density , lower energy , or higher redshift )",
    "can be further explored through a comparison of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission , and the relation between the optical and x - ray afterglow brightness . in the framework of the standard grb model we do not expect lower densities to impact the prompt emission since it is expected to be produced by internal processes ( shocks or magnetic dissipation ) that do not depend on the external medium . on the other hand , lower energies or higher",
    "redshifts will tend to systematically affect the prompt and afterglow emission .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fg_fx_t90 ] we plot the distributions of @xmath0-ray fluence ( @xmath71 ) , afterglow x - ray flux at the fiducial time of 8 hr ( @xmath72 ) , and duration ( @xmath73 ) for the three samples .",
    "these distributions allow us to explore the underlying reason for the difference in optical afterglow brightness between the three samples .",
    "first , we find that the distribution of @xmath71 values for _ sample 1 _ has a mean value that is about a factor of 5 times larger than for _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3_. this is indicative of higher redshifts for the latter two samples if the isotropic - equivalent energies of all short grbs are similar , or alternatively a lower energy scale if the redshifts are similar .    in the same vein , we find that the distributions of @xmath72 values for _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3 _ have lower means than for _ sample 1_. this result is indicative of overall fainter afterglow emission for the former two samples , and this can again be explained in the context of lower energies or higher redshifts . unlike in the case of the @xmath0-ray emission ,",
    "a lower circumburst density would also account for the fainter x - ray fluxes if @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we find that the durations of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3 _ are shorter by about a factor of 2 compared to the events with optical afterglows and coincident hosts , although there is substantial scatter in all three samples .",
    "the shorter durations are not trivially explained in the context of lower energies , higher redshifts , or lower densities .    to explore this result in more detail",
    "we plot the observed fluence as a function of duration for the events in all three samples ( figure  [ fig : t90_fg ] ) .",
    "we find that there is a mild positive correlation between the two quantities , but that the events in _ sample 1 _ appear to have larger fluences at a given duration compared to the events in _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3_. this is indicative of lower @xmath0-ray fluxes for the latter two samples , possibly as a result of higher redshifts .",
    "higher redshifts will also shift the intrinsic durations of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3 _ into better agreement with the bursts in _",
    "sample 1_.    we therefore conclude that the differences in prompt emission and optical / x - ray afterglow properties are consistent with a higher redshift origin for the bursts in _ sample 2 _ and _ sample 3_. the fainter afterglow emission is also consistent with lower density environments for these two samples , although this does not clearly explain the differences in prompt emission ( at least in the framework of the standard grb model ) .",
    "we return to the discussion of low density versus a high redshift origin in  [ sec : hosts ] when we investigate the host galaxy properties .",
    "in addition to the overall faintness of the optical and x - ray afterglows , a substantial difference in density may also be imprinted on the _ ratio _ of optical to x - ray brightness .",
    "this is because the synchrotron cooling frequency depends on density as @xmath75 , and is therefore expected to transition across the x - ray band as the density decreases . for @xmath76",
    "the x - ray and optical bands occupy the same portion of the synchrotron spectrum , with a resulting spectral index of @xmath77 to @xmath78 while for @xmath79 ( i.e. , high density ) , the spectrum between the two bands will be steeper , reaching a maximum value of @xmath80 when @xmath81 . in figure  [ fig : opt_xray ] we plot the x - ray flux versus optical magnitude for all three samples .",
    "for each burst the fluxes in the optical and x - rays are taken at similar times after the burst , or extrapolated to a common time .",
    "the correction factors due these extrapolations are generally @xmath82 ( table  [ tab : shbs ] ) . for the combined _ sample 1 _ and _ sample 2 _ we find a clear correlation between the fluxes in the two bands , leading to a mean optical to x - ray spectral index of @xmath83 .",
    "this is essentially indistinguishable from the ratio for long grbs , @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the median values are consistent with @xmath85 , but exhibit dispersion that is likely due to scatter in the values of @xmath86 and/or the location of @xmath87 relative to the x - ray band .",
    "the similarity of @xmath88 for long and short grbs does not necessarily indicate that the densities are similar for the two samples .",
    "in particular , if @xmath87 is located close to the x - ray band for long grbs , while for short grbs @xmath89 ( due to a lower density ) , the effect on @xmath88 will be marginal , particularly within the overall observed scatter .",
    "for example , with @xmath90 the difference in @xmath88 between a model with @xmath87 exactly intermediate between the optical and x - ray bands , and a model with @xmath91 , is @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , the scatter resulting from a range of @xmath93 is of the same order , @xmath94 .",
    "similarly , the nearly equivalent median @xmath88 values may indicate that for both grb populations @xmath91 . in this case , the resulting lower limits on @xmath87 therefore prevent the use of @xmath88 as an indicator of density .    comparing _ sample 1",
    "_ and _ sample 2 _ , we find no clear difference in @xmath88 ( figure  [ fig : opt_xray ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the bursts in _ sample 3 _ , which are all consistent with the same relation given the optical upper limits and a mix of x - ray detections and upper limits .",
    "thus , the ratio of optical to x - ray flux does not allow us to distinguish redshift / energy and density effects between the three samples .    to summarize , the optical afterglows of short grb without coincident hosts ( or with only optical limits ) are systematically fainter than those of short grbs with coincident hosts .",
    "the same is true for their x - ray fluxes and @xmath0-ray fluences .",
    "the fainter afterglows may reflect lower densities ( by an order of magnitude ) , but this does not naturally explain the lower @xmath0-ray fluences . alternatively , the fainter afterglows and @xmath0-ray fluences can be explained as a result of higher redshifts ( @xmath1 ) or lower energies ( by about a factor of 3 ) .",
    "we next turn to an analysis of the large - scale environments of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ , partly in comparison to the hosts of bursts in _",
    "sample 1_. as indicated in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we place limits of @xmath95 mag on the brightness of any galaxy underlying the five short grb positions ( table  [ tab : nohost ] ) .",
    "these limits are several magnitudes fainter than the measured brightnesses of short grb hosts at @xmath96 ( _ sample 1 _ ) .      to assess the potential that galaxies near each of the 5 bursts are the hosts , we calculate their probability of chance coincidence .",
    "we follow the methodology of @xcite , namely , we determine the expected number density of galaxies brighter than a measured magnitude , @xmath97 , using the results of deep optical galaxy surveys @xcite : @xmath98 the probability for a given separation , @xmath99 , is then given by @xmath100 where we use the fact that for offsets substantially larger than the galaxy size , @xmath101 is the appropriate radius in equation  [ eqn : prob ] @xcite .    the resulting distributions for each field are shown in figure  [ fig : prob1 ] .",
    "we include all galaxies that have probabilities of @xmath102 .",
    "we find that for 4 of the 5 bursts , faint galaxies ( @xmath103 mag ) can be identified within @xmath104 of the afterglow positions , with associated chance coincidence probabilities of @xmath105 ; in the case of grb090515 we do not detect any such faint galaxies within @xmath106 of the afterglow position .",
    "for grb080503 we also include the galaxy at an offset of @xmath107 and @xmath108 mag identified by @xcite based on their deeper stack of hst observations . on the other hand , for 4 of the 5 bursts we find that the galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence , @xmath109 , are brighter objects with offsets of about @xmath110 from the burst positions ; only in the case of grb080503 the lowest chance coincidence is associated with the nearest galaxy ( see @xcite ) .    for comparison",
    "we repeat the same analysis for short grbs from _ sample 1 _ which have faint coincident hosts ( grb060121 : 26.0 ab mag ; grb060313 : 26.6 ab mag ; and grb070707 : 27.3 ab mag ) .",
    "the results of the probability analysis are shown in figure  [ fig : prob2 ] .",
    "we find that in all three cases , the coincident hosts exhibit the lowest probability of chance coincidence , @xmath111 . only in the case of grb070707",
    "do we find galaxies with @xmath112 arcsec that have @xmath113 .",
    "thus , these three bursts are consistent with negligible offsets from faint galaxies , presumably at @xmath7 .",
    "the use of _ a posteriori _ probabilities to assign _",
    "unique _ galaxy associations is fraught with difficulties .",
    "first , for a given apparent brightness , galaxies located further away from the grb position , potentially due to larger kicks and/or longer merger timescales in the ns - ns merger framework , have higher probabilities of chance coincidence .",
    "since we have no _ a priori _ model - independent knowledge of the range of possible kicks and merger timescales , we can not rule out galaxies at very large offsets for which @xmath114 . indeed , a reasonable constraint of @xmath115 km s@xmath116 and @xmath117 gyr leads to only a weak constraint on the offset of @xmath18 mpc . at @xmath118 ( @xmath69 )",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , a projected distance at which nearly all galaxies will have a chance coincidence probability of order unity .",
    "a second difficulty is that we are using angular offsets , which ignore the potential wide range of redshifts ( and by extension also luminosities ) of the various galaxies .",
    "for example , if the faint galaxies with small offsets are located at @xmath7 , the corresponding physical offsets are @xmath8 kpc , while if the galaxies at @xmath121 offsets are located at @xmath15 ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) , the offsets are only somewhat larger , @xmath122 kpc .",
    "a galaxy at an even lower redshift , @xmath123 , with an offset of 50 kpc will be located about @xmath124 from the grb position and incur a large penalty in terms of chance coincidence probability .",
    "it is important to note , however , that galaxies at lower redshift will generally have brighter apparent magnitudes , partially compensating for the larger angular separations ( equations  [ eqn : gal ] and [ eqn : prob ] ) . in only a single case ( grb070809 )",
    "we find a galaxy with @xmath113 at @xmath125 ( which at @xmath126 for this galaxy corresponds to a physical offset of about 100 kpc ) .",
    "a final complication , which is not unique to this subset of events , is that we can only measure projected offsets , @xmath127 .",
    "the measured offsets can be used as lower limits on the actual offsets , while for the overall distribution we can apply an average correction factor of @xmath128 , based on the expectation value for the projection factor , @xmath129 .    despite these caveats",
    "we can address the probability that _ all _ of the associations are spurious .",
    "this joint probability is simply the product of the individual probabilities @xcite .",
    "for the faint galaxies at small angular separations the probability that all are spurious associations is @xmath130 , while for the galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence the joint probability is nearly 30 times lower , @xmath131 .",
    "conversely , the probabilities that _ none _ of the associations are spurious are @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively . these values indicate the some spurious coincidences may be present for _ sample 2_. indeed , the probabilities that 1 , 2 , or 3 associations are spurious are @xmath134 $ ] and @xmath135 $ ] , respectively . these results indicate that for the faint galaxies it is not unlikely that @xmath136 associations ( out of 5 ) are spurious , while for the brighter galaxies @xmath137 associations may be spurious .",
    "this analysis clearly demonstrates why a joint statistical study is superior to case - by - case attempts to associate short grbs with galaxies at substantial offsets .",
    "we therefore conclude that despite the weaknesses inherent to _ a posteriori _ probabilities , we conclude that there is stronger statistical support for an association of at least some of the 5 bursts in _ sample 2 _ with bright galaxies at separations of @xmath138 , than for an association with the faint galaxies at separations of @xmath139 .",
    "clearly , we can not rule out the possibility that in reality the hosts are a mix of faint and bright galaxies with a range of angular offsets of @xmath140 .",
    "we note that if deeper observations eventually lead to the detection of underlying galaxies ( @xmath141 ) at the level of @xmath142 mag , the associated chance coincidence probabilities will be @xmath143 per object , and the joint probabilities will be only slightly higher than for the bright galaxies with @xmath121 offsets . on the other hand , if we can achieve magnitude limits of @xmath19 mag on any coincident hosts , the resulting probabilities of chance coincidence will be larger than for the offset bright galaxies .",
    "thus , eliminating the possibility of underlying hosts at the level of @xmath19 mag is of the utmost importance .",
    "so far , only grb080503 has been observed to such a depth with no detected coincident host @xcite , but observations of the full sample are required for a robust statistical comparison . as we discuss in  [ sec : highz ] below , such deep limits will also reduce the probability of underlying hosts based on redshift arguments .    beyond the use of projected angular offsets , we note that the faint galaxies near the burst positions are likely to have projected physical offsets of about @xmath144 kpc . to assess the projected physical offsets for the galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence we measured spectroscopic redshifts in three cases ( grbs 061201 , 070809 , and 090515 ;  [ sec : obs ] ) . in the case of grb061201",
    ", the galaxy redshift of @xmath36 leads to a projected physical offset of @xmath145 kpc @xcite . in the case of grb070809 , the lowest probability of chance coincidence",
    "is not associated with the star forming galaxy at @xmath39 identified by @xcite , but instead belongs to the early - type galaxy identified here , which has a redshift of @xmath40 , and hence an offset of @xmath146 kpc . finally , for grb090515 ,",
    "the lowest probability of chance coincidence is associated with a cluster early - type galaxy at @xmath44 , leading to a physical offset of @xmath147 kpc .",
    "thus , two scenarios emerge from our investigation of the large - scale environments : ( i ) the bursts are spatially coincident with currently - undetected galaxies ( with @xmath148 mag ) ; or ( ii ) the bursts have substantial offsets of at least @xmath149 kpc depending on whether they are associated with faint galaxies at small angular separations , or brighter galaxies at @xmath30 ; for the ensemble of 5 events the larger offsets are statistically more likely than the @xmath8 kpc offsets . in the context of large offsets , even larger values may be possible if the bursts originated in galaxies with larger separations and @xmath150 .",
    "these two scenarios echo the possibilities that emerged from the analysis of the afterglow and prompt emission properties (  [ sec : ag ] ) .",
    "distinguishing between these possibilities is clearly of fundamental importance to our understanding of short grbs : the former scenario will point to a population of very faint hosts ( likely at high redshifts ) , while the latter scenario will provide evidence for large offsets ( due to kicks or a globular cluster origin ) and hence ns - ns / ns - bh progenitors for at least some short grbs .",

    "a wide range of host magnitudes , @xmath155 mag , is apparent .",

    "the latter lower limits are comparable to the redshift upper limits inferred from the afterglow detections .",

    "we note , however , that the one known short grb at @xmath12 ( grb090426 ; @xcite ) has a host galaxy luminosity of @xmath164 l@xmath11 , which may suggest that the appropriate redshift lower limits are @xmath161 .",
    "the possibility that the five bursts originated at @xmath161 leads to a bimodal redshift distribution ( figure  [ fig : mags ] ) .",

    "if the 5 bursts are instead hosted by @xmath171 l@xmath11 galaxies , the inferred lower limits on the redshifts ( @xmath160 ) lead to a potentially more uniform redshift distribution .",
    "it is difficult to explain a bimodal redshift distribution with a single progenitor population such as ns - ns binaries , without appealing to , for example , a bimodal distribution of merger timescales .",
    "another possibility is two distinct progenitor populations , producing bursts of similar observed properties but with distinct redshift ranges .",
    "while these possibilities are difficult to exclude , they do not provide a natural explanation for the short grb population .",
    "a final alternative explanation is that any underlying hosts reside at similar redshifts to the known hosts in _",
    "sample 1 _ ( @xmath16 ) , but have significantly lower luminosities of @xmath172 l@xmath11 .",
    "this scenario would not naturally explain why the bursts in _ sample 2 _ have fainter optical and x - ray afterglows , as well as lower @xmath0-ray fluences .",
    "we therefore do not consider this possibility to be the likely explanation .",
    "while higher redshifts may explain the lack of detected hosts , the fainter afterglows , and the weaker @xmath0-ray fluences of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ , this scenario suffers from several difficulties outlined above .",
    "the alternative explanation is that the bursts occurred at significant offsets relative to their hosts , and hence in lower density environments that would explain the faint afterglow emission ( though possibly not the lower @xmath0-ray fluences ) .",
    "as we demonstrated in  [ sec : prob ] , the offsets may be @xmath139 ( @xmath8 kpc ) if the bursts originated in the faint galaxies at the smallest angular separations , or @xmath121 ( @xmath173 kpc ) if they originated in the brighter galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence . below we address the implications of these two possible offset groups through a comparison to the offsets measured for the bursts in _ sample 1 _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we plot the distributions of projected angular offsets for the short grbs with and without coincident hosts in figure  [ fig : offset1 ] .",

    "this is clearly distinct from the distribution for _ sample 1_. the effect is less pronounced if we associate the bursts with the galaxies located at the smallest angular offsets ( figure  [ fig : offset1 ] ) . even for these separations",
    "the mean and standard deviation are @xmath179 arcsec .    as noted in  [ sec : prob ] , the projected angular distances may not be the most robust quantity for measuring the offset distribution .",
    "an alternative quantity is the offset normalized by each host s effective radius @xcite .",
    "this quantity takes into account the varying sizes of the hosts due to both intrinsic size variations and redshift effects .",
    "it also gives a better indication of whether the burst coincides with the host light or is significantly offset .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : offset2 ] , the host - normalized offsets of _ sample 1 _ have a mean and standard deviation of about @xmath180 @xmath181 , and a range of about @xmath182 @xmath181 . a log - normal fit results in a mean of @xmath183 and a width of @xmath184 . the bursts in _ sample 2",
    "_ have much larger host - normalized offsets , with @xmath185 if they originated in the galaxies with the lowest chance coincidence probability . even if we associate the bursts with the nearest faint hosts , the distribution has a mean of about @xmath186 @xmath181 , reflecting the fact that the effective radii of the faint galaxies are smaller than those of the brighter ones",
    ".    finally , we plot the projected physical offsets in figure  [ fig : offset3 ] .",
    "the mean and standard deviation for _ sample 1 _ are @xmath187 kpc , and a log - normal fit results in a mean of @xmath188 and a width of @xmath189 .",
    "on the other hand , the bursts in _ sample 2 _ have a mean offset of about 19 kpc if they arise in the faint galaxies with small angular separation , or about 40 kpc if they arise in the brighter galaxies , again pointing to distinct distributions .",
    "the distributions of angular , physical , and host - normalized offsets exhibit a clear bimodality if we associate the bursts in _ sample 2 _ with the galaxies at @xmath30 .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the more meaningful quantities , namely physical and host - normalized offsets ( figures  [ fig : offset2 ] and [ fig : offset3 ] ) .",
    "the effect is still apparent , though less pronounced in the case of association with the faint galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "thus , if the offset scenario is correct , the resulting distributions point to a possible bimodality rather than a single continuous distribution of offsets .",
    "the cumulative distributions of physical offsets for _ sample 1 _ alone , and in conjunction with the two possible offset groups for _ sample 2 _ are shown in figure  [ fig : offset4 ] .",
    "the combined distributions have a median of about 4 kpc , driven by the bursts with coincident hosts .",
    "however , there is a clear extension to larger physical offsets in the case of association with the brighter galaxies , with about @xmath190 of all objects having @xmath191 kpc .",
    "the cumulative distributions are particularly useful for comparison with ns - ns merger models since predictions exist for both the kick scenario and the globular cluster origin model .",
    "we turn to this discussion below .",
    "we have shown that the lack of host galaxy detections in coincidence with the bursts in _ sample 2 _ indicates either a high redshift ( @xmath12 ) origin , or substantial projected offsets of @xmath192 kpc ( @xmath193 @xmath181 ) .",
    "both scenarios can account for the lack of underlying galaxy detections and the fainter optical / x - ray afterglows ( either due to redshift or density effect ) ; the possibility of large offsets from galaxies at @xmath30 , however , does not naturally explain the lower @xmath0-ray fluences and somewhat shorter durations of the bursts in _",
    "sample 2_. indeed , the lower fluences can be more easily accommodated in the case of undetected high redshift coincident hosts , or in the case of faint hosts with offsets of @xmath8 kpc .",
    "below we test the results of the offset scenario against predictions for ns - ns merger models and dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries in globular clusters .",
    "we also investigate whether the densities expected at offsets of @xmath194 kpc ( i.e. , galaxy halos or the intergalactic medium ) can accommodate the observed optical magnitudes .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of the various scenarios for short grb energetics .",
    "the sample of short grbs with optical afterglows represents about @xmath195 of all short bursts , and may thus not be fully representative .",
    "one often - discussed bias is that the bursts with optical afterglows require a high circumburst density , and therefore have negligible offsets .",
    "however , from our analysis in this paper it is clear that one explanation for the lack of coincident hosts for the bursts in _ sample 2 _ is indeed large offsets , _ despite their detection in the optical band_.    the bursts with only x - ray afterglow detections ( _ swift_/xrt ) have typical positional uncertainties of @xmath196 and therefore lead to a deeper ambiguity about the identity of the hosts .",
    "we have previously argued that most of these bursts are associated with galaxies consistent with a negligible offset ( or as large as tens of kpc ; @xcite ) . in some cases",
    "larger offsets have been advocated based on _ a posteriori _ chance coincidence probabilities ( e.g. , grb050509b : @xcite ; grb060502b : @xcite ) . however , from the analysis in  [ sec : prob ] it is clear that while the inferred probabilities are only weakly dependent on the positional accuracy when @xmath197 ( i.e. , galaxies at large offsets ) , a large penalty is incurred for faint galaxies located _ within _ the x - ray error circles since in that case the appropriate value in equation  [ eqn : prob ] is @xmath198 . as a result",
    ", the faint galaxies will have chance coincidence probabilities of @xmath150 . to avoid this complication in our comparison to ns - ns model predictions",
    "we restrict the analysis to the sample with optical afterglow positions .    in recent work by @xcite",
    "we have shown that the offset distribution for short grbs with optical and/or x - ray positions , and accounting for incompleteness due to bursts with only @xmath0-ray positions , is broadly consistent with the predictions of ns - ns merger models @xcite .",
    "in particular , we concluded that @xmath199 of all short bursts have @xmath200 kpc , while @xmath201 have offsets of @xmath21 kpc .",
    "we repeat the analysis here using the offsets inferred in ",
    "[ sec : kick ] for both the faint galaxies at small angular separations and the brighter galaxies at larger separations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : offset4 ] , the model predictions have a median of about 6 kpc , compared to about 4 kpc for the observed sample .",
    "on the other hand , the models predict @xmath20 of offsets to be @xmath202 kpc , in good agreement with the observed distribution in both the @xmath8 kpc and @xmath203 kpc scenarios .",
    "we note that the overall smaller offsets measured from the data may be due to projections effects .",
    "indeed , the mean correction factor of @xmath128 nicely reconciles the theoretical and observed distributions .    in the previous section we noted a bimodality in the physical and host - normalized offsets for",
    "_ sample 1 _ and _ sample 2 _ ( figures  [ fig : offset2 ] and [ fig : offset3 ] ) . in the framework of ns - ns binary kicks",
    "this bimodality may indicate that the binaries generally remain bound to their host galaxies , thereby spending most of their time at the maximal distance defined by @xmath204 ( i.e. , with their kinetic energy stored as potential energy ; @xcite ) .",
    "this would require typical kick velocities of less than a few hundred km s@xmath116 .",
    "we further compare the observed offset distribution to predictions for dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries in globular clusters , with a range of host galaxy virial masses of @xmath205 m@xmath206 @xcite .",
    "these models predict a range of only @xmath207 of all ns - ns mergers to occur within 10 kpc of the host center , in contrast to the observed distribution with about @xmath208 with @xmath209 kpc .",
    "we stress that this result is independent of what offsets we assign to the bursts in _ sample 2 _ since they account for only 1/4 of the bursts with optical afterglows . on the other hand ,",
    "the globular cluster origin may account for the bimodality in the physical and host - normalized offsets ( figures  [ fig : offset2 ] and [ fig : offset3 ] ) , with the objects in _ sample 2 _ arising in globular clusters and the objects with coincident hosts arising from primordial ns - ns binaries .",
    "this possibility also agrees with the predicted fraction of dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries of @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "the cumulative offset distributions for _ sample 2 _ alone ( assuming the hosts are the galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence ) is well - matched by the range of predictions for dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries in globular clusters ( figure  [ fig : offset4 ] ) . in this scenario , however , the implication is that short grbs outside of globular clusters do not experience kicks as expected for ns - ns binaries since the largest measured offset is only 15 kpc .    unless the populations of short grbs with only x - ray or @xmath0-ray positions have fundamentally different offset distributions , we conclude that the measured offsets of short grbs and the predicted offsets for ns - ns kicks are in good agreement , _ if we treat all short grbs with optical afterglows as a single population_. alternatively , it is possible that the bimodal distributions of physical and host - normalized offsets point to a progenitor bimodality , with the bursts in _ sample 2 _ originating in globular clusters .",
    "large offsets are expected to result in low circumburst densities , and we now investigate whether the observed optical magnitudes for _ sample 2 _ can be used to place meaningful constraints on the offsets .",
    "the optical afterglow magnitudes do not provide a direct measure of the circumburst density since they depend on a complex combination of density , energy , and fractions of the burst energy imparted to the radiating electrons ( @xmath211 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath212 ) . from our comparison of the x - ray and optical afterglows (  [ sec : ag ] ) we were unable to clearly locate the cooling frequency , which in principle can provide additional constraints on the density .",
    "however , we can still gain some insight into the required circumburst densities using a few basic assumptions .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0-ray energy ( @xmath213 ) is a reasonable proxy for the total energy , that @xmath214 , and that @xmath215 .",
    "we further use a fiducial redshift of @xmath68 ( figure  [ fig : mags ] ) and a fiducial observation time of 8 hr (  [ sec : ag ] ) .    to determine @xmath213 we use the @xmath216 kev fluences measured by _",
    "( table  [ tab : shbs ] ) , and determine a correction factor to account for the incomplete energy coverage using bursts that have also been detected by satellites with a broader energy range ( figure  [ fig : t90_fg ] ) .",
    "we find a typical correction factor of @xmath217 for the @xmath218 kev range .",
    "for the fiducial redshift of @xmath68 , the mean energy for short grbs with optical afterglows is @xmath219 erg , when we include the correction factor ( figure  [ fig : z_egiso ] ) .    with these assumptions",
    "we find the following relation between the optical brightness and the circumburst density @xcite : @xmath220 given the typical observed fluxes of about 2 @xmath221jy for _ sample 1 _ , and about 0.6 @xmath221jy for _ sample 2 _ , we infer typical minimum densities of @xmath222 and @xmath223 @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "thus , the observed optical brightnesses can be produced even at very low densities that are typical of the igm .",
    "this indicates that we can not rule out the large offset scenario based on density arguments .",
    "indeed , even if we allow for more typical values of @xmath224 , the resulting densities are @xmath225 and @xmath226 @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "these results compare favorably with predictions for ns - ns kicks , which suggest that most mergers will occur at densities of @xmath227 @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of densities in globular clusters is not well known , preventing a meaningful comparison to our inferred minimum densities @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate the energetics of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ in the context of a high - redshift origin ( @xmath161 ) , an origin in the faint galaxies at @xmath228 separations ( @xmath229 ) , and an origin in the galaxies with the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath213 are shown in figure  [ fig : z_egiso ] .",
    "for the lowest redshift origin , the inferred values are @xmath231 erg , for a @xmath229 origin they are @xmath232 erg , and for a @xmath161 origin they are @xmath233 erg .    for comparison , the mean value for the bursts in _ sample 1 _ is @xmath234 erg , with a range of @xmath235 erg .",
    "however , there is a clear redshift dependence for the measured @xmath213 values ( figure  [ fig : z_egiso ] ) , with @xmath236 erg at @xmath237 and @xmath238 erg at @xmath239 .",
    "thus , the bursts in _ sample 2 _ generally fit within the known range of isotropic energies regardless of their actual redshift .",
    "indeed , at @xmath169 they exhibit similar values of @xmath240 to that of grb090426 . as a result , we can not use the inferred energy release as a clear discriminant of the redshift range for _ sample 2_.    if the bursts in _ sample 2 _ indeed originated at high redshifts , the resulting isotropic - equivalent energies suggest that there is either a large spread in the energy release of short grbs ( at least 2 orders of magnitude ) or a large variations in the ejecta geometry . if the typical energy for short grbs is about @xmath241 erg , as indicated by the nearest events , then the inferred values of @xmath242 at @xmath169 indicate opening angles of @xmath243 .",
    "this is similar to the opening angle of about @xmath244 that was inferred for grb051221 @xcite .",
    "we undertook the first systematic study of short grbs with detected optical afterglows ( and hence sub - arcsecond position ) but no coincident host galaxies to limits of @xmath148 mag .",
    "we find that the optical afterglows of these bursts are fainter by about 1.4 mag compared to the optical afterglows of short grbs with coincident hosts .",
    "they are similarly fainter in x - rays , and have somewhat lower @xmath0-ray fluences and slightly shorter durations .",
    "both samples have similar ratios of x - ray to optical flux , which are moreover similar to the ratios measured for long grbs .",
    "the fainter afterglows of the bursts lacking coincident hosts may be due to lower densities , lower energies , or higher redshifts .",
    "however , we note that only the scenarios with lower energies or higher redshifts naturally explain the faintness of the prompt emission _ in the context of the standard grb model_. this is because in the context of internal processes ( shocks or magnetic dissipation ) the external density should not play a role .",
    "we further use deep optical imaging to determine the probability of chance coincidence for galaxies in the field around each burst , and to place redshift limits for underlying hosts under the assumption that they are drawn from the same distribution of the detected short grb hosts ( @xmath10 l@xmath11 ) .",
    "this analysis leads to the following possible scenarios : ( i ) the underlying hosts are fainter than @xmath245 mag , indicative of redshifts of @xmath163 ( if @xmath246 l@xmath11 ) or @xmath161 ( if @xmath247l@xmath11 ) ; or ( ii ) the hosts are galaxies with substantial offsets  either faint galaxies at separations of @xmath228 ( @xmath248 kpc for @xmath7 ) or brighter galaxies , which we find to be located at @xmath30 , with offsets of @xmath249 ( @xmath250 kpc ) . in the former scenario , unless the galaxies have @xmath246 l@xmath11 , the resulting redshift distribution is bimodal with peaks at @xmath16 and @xmath251 .",
    "such a scenario most likely requires a bimodal age distribution in the context of ns - ns mergers , or two distinct progenitor systems dominating at low and high redshifts . while this can not be ruled out by present data , the lack of overlap at @xmath252 is difficult to explain .",
    "we also conclude that it is unlikely that any faint underlying hosts are low - luminosity galaxies ( @xmath253 l@xmath11 ) at similar redshifts to the detected hosts , since this does not naturally explain the difference in afterglow and prompt emission properties",
    ".    in the context of the large offsets scenario , the probability of chance coincidence ( both individually and for the sample ) is lower for the brighter galaxies at offsets of @xmath249 than for the faint galaxies at offsets of @xmath228 .",
    "however , it is not unlikely that the true associations are a mix of both populations , since in each case there is a non - negligible probability that @xmath137 of the associations are spurious .",
    "we note that optical positions are crucial for a uniform comparison of the chance coincidence probabilities for faint galaxies with small offsets and bright galaxies with larger offsets ; in the case of only x - ray positions there is an inherent bias ( in the sense of _ a posteriori _ ) against associations with faint galaxies inside the error circle , despite the fact that they are consistent with no offset .    from spectroscopic observations for 3 of the 5 bursts we find that the galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence are a star forming galaxy at @xmath36 ( grb061201 ) , an early - type galaxy at @xmath40 ( grb070809 ) , and an early - type cluster member galaxy at @xmath44 ( grb090515 ) .",
    "if these associations are indeed correct , they only slightly alter the host demographics , which are dominated by star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , this does suggest that our present understanding of the relative ratios of star forming and elliptical hosts may be incomplete .",
    "the resulting distributions of angular , physical , and host - normalized offsets for the bursts with and without coincident hosts appear to be distinct , rather than continuous .",
    "however , the joint distribution of projected physical offsets is in good agreement with theoretical predictions for ns - ns binary mergers . on the other hand",
    ", the predicted distribution for dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries in globular clusters provides a much poorer fit to the entire data set , unless they account for only the bursts with large offsets ( _ sample 2 _ ) . in the case of a hybrid population of primordial and dynamically - formed binaries , with the latter accounting for only the large offsets ,",
    "the fact that all the remaining offsets ( _ sample 1 _ ) are @xmath18 kpc , is indicative of no significant kicks .",
    "the large physical offsets also naturally explain the fainter afterglow emission as a result of lower circumburst densities .",
    "the resulting isotropic @xmath0-ray energies match the observed distribution for short grbs with coincident hosts , either at @xmath15 or at @xmath7 .",
    "our conclusion that large offsets of @xmath254 kpc ( corresponding to @xmath193 galactic effective radii ) are a likely explanation for the bursts with optical afterglows and no coincident hosts is of fundamental importance .",
    "the only progenitor model that naturally explains this result in the merger of ns - ns / ns - bh binaries , most likely due to kicks , or possibly with a minor contribution from a globular cluster population ( accounting specifically for the events in _ sample 2 _ ) .",
    "while a conclusive demonstration of a large offset requires an absorption redshift measurement that matches an offset galaxy redshift , the distribution of optical afterglow magnitudes indicates that this will be difficult to achieve .",
    "indeed , an absorption redshift is available for only one likely short grb @xcite .",
    "we end with several important observations .",
    "first , rapid optical follow - up of short grbs with 8-meter class telescopes is essential since observations to a depth of about 25 mag within a few hours after the burst may recover nearly all optical afterglows , regardless of circumburst density ( figure  [ fig : optag1 ] ) .",
    "second , short grbs with only x - ray positions are unlikely to provide strong support for either negligible or large offsets due to the appreciable size of the error circles and the fact that the sample with optical afterglows exhibits wide host galaxy diversity , i.e. , events with coincident bright hosts at @xmath255 , events with coincident faint hosts likely at @xmath7 , and events with no coincident hosts likely due to offsets .",
    "third , a meaningful study of short grb offsets requires a statistical approach to mitigate the shortcomings of _ a posteriori _ chance coincidence probabilities , as well as to incorporate the relevant information from afterglow and prompt emission observations .",
    "finally , we note that from a wide range of observations of both the afterglows and host galaxies it appears that the case for ns - ns mergers as the progenitors of short grbs is gaining observational support .",
    "our main result here is that short grbs with optical afterglows and no detected host galaxies are somewhat less likely to be explained with high redshifts or with dwarf galaxy hosts at low redshift .",
    "instead , these bursts likely exploded @xmath8 kpc from galaxies at @xmath229 or tens of kpc from galaxies at @xmath15 . with larger samples",
    ", these possibilities will allow us to improve our understanding of the short grb redshift distribution , the host galaxy demographics , and predictions for gravitational wave detections .",
    "if high redshifts indeed turn out to be prevalent , this will have a significant effect on the possibility of multiple progenitor populations .",

    "<S> we investigate the afterglow properties and large - scale environments of several short - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with sub - arcsecond optical afterglow positions but no bright coincident host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility of significant offsets , a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model . </S>",
    "<S> five such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical afterglows , and we find that their optical , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray emission are systematically fainter </S>",
    "<S> . these differences may be due to lower circumburst densities ( by about an order of magnitude ) , to higher redshifts ( by @xmath1 ) , or to lower energies ( by about a factor of 3 ) , although in the standard grb model the smaller @xmath0-ray fluences can not be explained by lower densities . to study the large - scale environments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying hosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near each burst . in 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence ( @xmath2 ) </S>",
    "<S> are associated with bright galaxies at separations of @xmath3 , while somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with faint galaxies at separations of @xmath4 . by measuring redshifts for the brighter galaxies in three cases ( @xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> we find physical offsets of @xmath6 kpc , while for the faint hosts the assumption of @xmath7 leads to offsets of @xmath8 kpc . alternatively </S>",
    "<S> , the limits at the burst positions ( @xmath9 mag ) can be explained by typical short grb host galaxies ( @xmath10 l@xmath11 ) at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , two possibilities exist : ( i ) @xmath13 of short grbs explode @xmath14 kpc or @xmath8 kpc from the centers of @xmath15 or @xmath7 galaxies , respectively , and have fainter afterglows due to the resulting lower densities ; or ( ii ) @xmath13 of short grbs occur at @xmath12 and have fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the high redshift scenario leads to a bimodal redshift distribution , with peaks at @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the large offset scenario leads to an offset distribution that is well - matched by theoretical predictions of ns - ns / ns - bh binary kicks , or by a hybrid population with globular cluster ns - ns binaries at large offsets and primordial binaries at offsets of @xmath18 kpc ( indicative of negligible kicks ) . </S>",
    "<S> deeper constraints on any coincident galaxies to @xmath19 mag ( using the _ hubble space telescope _ ) will allow us to better exclude the high - redshift scenario . </S>"
