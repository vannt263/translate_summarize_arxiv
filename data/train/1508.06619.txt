    "the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction between two magnetic moments embedded in a solid was originally derived for the free electron gas , @xcite and it has been extensively studied since then .",
    "it has the heisenberg form @xmath7 and shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of the distance @xmath8 between the two magnetic moments ; for example , @xmath9 for the electron gas in three dimensions ( 3d ) , where @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the fermi momentum . using lattice models , dzyaloshinsky and moriya ( dm ) showed that@xcite in situations with broken symmetry ( inversion or time reversal ) , there appears a vector or a tensor interaction term , @xmath3 and @xmath12 , respectively , in addition to the scalar , rkky interaction @xmath2 , so that the net interaction energy is given by the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "there is currently a considerable interest on this less - studied dm interactions , because of the recent observation@xcite of skyrmions , a novel vortex - like spin structure@xcite , that forms due to the competition between the rkky and the dm terms .",
    "while the rkky interaction is quite simply illustrated by taking the example of the free electron gas , this is not the case for the dm interactions . the original work of dm involved lattice models , while in many subsequent works , complicated interactions such as non - magnetic spin - flip centers@xcite or relativistic scattering potentials@xcite were used to obtain the dm interactions . in this paper ,",
    "we point out that the simple generalization of the electron gas to include spin polarization does indeed produce the dm interaction , _ albeit _ just the tensor part as the vector part @xmath13 because the inversion symmetry is still present .",
    "before we discuss the case of the spin - polarized electron gas , we note that the coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom is essential to the dm interactions , as without it electron energies are spin degenerate , @xmath14 , and it turns out that , if this is true , then there would only be the rkky interaction .",
    "this is the case for the standard , non - spin - polarized electron gas .",
    "if there is sufficient symmetry , even in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the electron states may still be spin degenerate , so that the presence of the spin - orbit coupling alone is not enough to produce the dm interaction . in general , the presence of the inversion symmetry in a solid leads to the condition @xmath15 while the time reversal symmetry implies that @xmath16 so that if both symmetries are present , one obtains the spin - degenerate energies , viz .",
    ", @xmath17 .",
    "this equality is violated if there is at least one broken symmetry . the simplest way to include",
    "such a broken symmetry is to consider spin polarized bands in a 3d electron gas , which has broken time reversal symmetry .",
    "this may for example be produced by a magnetic field , either externally applied or produced by the constituent atoms in the solid .",
    "we now consider the interaction between magnetic moments placed in the spin - polarized electron gas .",
    "the magnetic interaction energy between the two localized moments is obtained by using the quantum mechanical perturbation theory .",
    "the first magnetic moment perturbs the electron gas , which is then felt by the second moment , thereby coupling the two moments .",
    "the unperturbed eigenstates of the electron gas are plane wave states @xmath18 where we have taken the energies to be spin dependent with the @xmath19 sign corresponding to the energy of the spin @xmath20 and @xmath21 states , respectively , and the box normalization has been used with @xmath22 being the volume of the box .",
    "we now introduce two localized spins @xmath23 and @xmath24 , located at the origin and at the position @xmath25 , respectively , which interact with the electron gas via the contact interaction    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the spin of the electrons , and , in operator form , the perturbing potentials may be written as @xmath28 and similarly for @xmath29 .",
