    "the spontaneous spinning of a dielectric sphere in a uniform dc electric field has been known for over a century , first attributed to the work of quincke in 1896 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is enjoying resurgent interest driven by the experimentally observed intriguing dynamics of quincke - rotating spheres @xcite and drops @xcite , as well as an increasing interest in electric field directed assembly of colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "theoretical analyses of rigid spheres show that an isolated sphere can exhibit lorenz chaotic rotations @xcite , pairs of spheres can undergo intricate trajectories @xcite , large populations can self - organize and undergo directed motion @xcite , and a suspension can exhibit lower effective viscosity @xcite or increased conductivity @xcite compared to the suspending fluid .",
    "the quincke rotation arises from particle polarization in an applied electric field due to the accumulation of free charges at the particle interface @xcite .",
    "the induced dipole due to these free charges lags the application of the uniform dc electric field .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath0-th dipole component in a coordinate system centered at the particle ( and in the case of an ellipsoid aligned with its axes , see figure [ fige ] ) is described by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the low- and high - frequency susceptibilities and @xmath3 the maxwell - wagner polarization time along the @xmath0-th axis of the ellipsoid .    for a shape - isotropic particle such as a sphere with radius @xmath4 @xmath5 and",

    "[ eq ] shows that the electrorotation is possible only if @xmath15 , i.e. , the suspending fluid and sphere satisfy the condition @xmath16 .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the induced dipole moment of the sphere oriented opposite to the direction of the applied field .",
    "a perturbation in the dipole orientation produces torque , which induces physical rotation of the sphere ( around an axis perpendicular to the applied field direction ) .",
    "the induced surface - charge distribution rotates with the sphere , however , the exterior fluid recharges the interface . the balance between charge convection by rotation and supply by conduction from the bulk results in a steady oblique orientation of the dipole relative to the field direction and constant torque .",
    "an ellipsoidal particle is expected to display more complex electrorotation dynamics than a sphere @xcite due to its anisotropic shape .",
    "the polarization relaxation times and susceptibilities along the long and short axes differ .",
    "the classic result is that an axisymmetric ellipsoid aligns its long axis with the applied electric field @xcite . in stronger fields , @xmath17 , a stable orientation perpendicular to the external dc field",

    "the bistability disappears above @xmath23 , @xmath24        at even higher field strengths , time integration of the equations of motion and polarization relaxation @xcite shows that the ellipsoid axis can begin to precess around the field direction ; regimes of both regular and chaotic oscillations are found with increasing field strength @xcite .",
    "these theoretically predicted peculiar features of the electrorotation of ellipsoids have not been experimentally verified . in this paper , we perform a systematic study of ellipsoid dynamics as a function of field strength and aspect ratio for prolate ellipsoid .",
    "the millimeter sized ellipsoid , needed for direct visualization , is made by cross - linking a spheroidally deformed drop of polymer noa 81 ( norland optical adhesive ) .",
    "the drop deformation is induced by application of a uniform dc electric field after the drop is suspended in pdms 500 cst ( utc ) in a set - up similar to @xcite .",
    "once steady - state deformation is reached , the drop is exposed to uv radiation @xmath25 for about a @xmath26 .",

    "experiments confirm this scenario .",

    "the amplitude can be tuned by modifying the strength of the electric field and the particle aspect ratio .",

    "this assumption is justified by the fact that the substrate introduces inhomogeneity in the conductivity near the ellipsoid : a substrate with a negligible conductivity can be accounted for by an effectively lower conductivity .",
    "some discrepancies may also originate from the additional friction due to roughness on particles surface and substrate .",
