    "it is also relevant to the coincidence problem , that is , why dark energy and matter appear to have roughly the same energy density today ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are two cases to be examined for the limiting value of @xmath28 , regardless of the critical point being finite or at infinity :    \\(i ) @xmath28 asymptotically tends to a strictly positive limit .",
    "then , it is easily seen that the transition ( [ eq : transition ] ) does always happen , since the critical value of the potential behaves as an effective cosmological constant and the energy of the scalar field tends to this value whereas the energy of the fluid tends to zero .",

    "it is necessary that the energy density of the scalar field remains insignificant during most of the history of the universe and emerges only at late times to account for the current acceleration of the universe .",

    "the generic behaviour of solutions is not a new feature of models involving scalar fields .",
    "we mention for example the well known instability ( with respect to bounded variation initial data ) result by christodoulou @xcite about scalar fields collapsing to a naked singularity and even in the realm of homogeneous stars ( regularly matched with nonhomogeneous exteriors ) , genericity of collapsing solutions ending in a black hole has been discovered to be true both in gr @xcite and in hog gravity @xcite .",
    "the above results were rigorously proved only assuming that critical points are finite , and that @xmath28 is eventually non - negative as @xmath203 .",
    "it must be remarked that the latter assumption does not enter in the study of the late time behaviour around a critical point @xmath109 , because for that situation only the behaviour of the potential near @xmath62 is important and no growth at infinity assumptions on @xmath1 are actually needed .",
    "the other assumption plays the role to ensure that the flat plateau at infinity are unstable ( as proved for the special case of the potential ( [ rsquared ] ) in @xcite ) , whereas if @xmath204 from above we have an asymptotically stable configuration . as a representative of the latter class of stable configurations",
    "we have studied the late time behaviour of the energy in the case of exponential potential , finding results similar to the non coupled case @xcite . however",
    ", our dynamical system is much harder to deal with , because the evolution equation for @xmath93 does not decouple as in @xcite and moreover its equilibria are not hyperbolic .",
    "when the decay parameter @xmath205 is small , where small  depends on @xmath2 , see region 1 in figure [ fig : cases ] , the scalar field dominates , whereas other stable configurations correspond to scaling solutions where both energies nontrivially contribute to the total energy of the system .",
    "one can encounter in the same potential all the situations studied so far , for instance , one can have a potential exhibiting more than one local minima , or a local minimum and an exponential decay at infinity . in that case since at least two asymptotically stable configurations for the system can be reached , the late time behaviour of the energies and their exchange necessarily depends on the initial data of the problem .    the cases studied in section [ sec : exchange ] of course do not cover all possible situations , even under assumption [ assum : v ] . in particular , one can take into account degenerate minima for the potential . in this case",
    ", it is not hard to see that the counterpart of systems and becomes irregular near @xmath206 , and to infer about the behaviour of the angle @xmath130 , one can not straightforwardly extend the techniques used here .",
    "nevertheless , research in this direction tends to confirm the same generic behaviour showed here for the nondegenerate case @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems appropriate to conclude that energy transfer is completely driven exclusively by the sign of the fluid pressure when the scalar reaches a _",
    "finite _ stable equilibrium , whereas for stable configurations at infinity  the potential profile becomes crucial .",
    "another important question that should be further investigated is the case of closed cosmologies .",
    "we believe that a closed model can not avoid recollapse , unless the minimum of the potential is strictly positive . in that case , the asymptotic state must be de sitter space .",

    "let us denote by @xmath210 this compact set and define @xmath211 as @xmath212\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath213 is a positive constant .",
    "then @xmath211 is a compact set because the following facts hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath211 is a closed set in @xmath214 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath215 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath216 , and therefore @xmath217 is bounded ; 4 .",
    "@xmath218 , and therefore @xmath97 also is bounded ; 5 .   from and the above facts , @xmath219 , and so @xmath93 is bounded too .",
    "let @xmath220 be the connected component of @xmath211 containing @xmath221 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath93 is positive on @xmath222 and we claim that @xmath222 is _ positively invariant _ with respect to , i.e. solutions , with initial data in @xmath223 , live in @xmath222 @xmath224 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath225 be such a solution and @xmath226 . when @xmath227 , equations and imply that both @xmath46 and @xmath57 decrease .",
    "moreover , it can be proved by contradiction that @xmath228 otherwise there would exist some @xmath227 such that @xmath229 , but then @xmath230 a contradiction .",
    "thus , holds .",
    "but since @xmath231 along the flow ( cf remark [ rem : w ] ) , it follows that @xmath232 where the last inequality follows from .",
    "all in all we have proved that , as long as @xmath93 remains positive it is strictly bounded away from zero , thus , @xmath233 , and from this fact it is straightforward to conclude that @xmath225 lives in @xmath222 @xmath224 .    using the properties of @xmath222 proved so far , lasalle s invariance theorem @xcite can be applied to the functions @xmath46 and @xmath234 in @xmath222 , to show that every solution with initial data in @xmath222 must be such that @xmath235 and @xmath236 as @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath93 is strictly bounded away from zero in @xmath222 , both @xmath46 and @xmath237 must go to zero , which means @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "now the fourth of @xmath240 implies that @xmath93 is monotone and therefore admits a limit .",
    "this means that @xmath28 also admits limit , and this limit must be unavoidably @xmath241 , otherwise @xmath242 would tend to a nonzero value , and so would the right hand side in the second equation of , a contradiction .",
    "therefore the solution approaches the equilibrium point @xmath221 .    if @xmath243 , the above argument can be easily adapted . in this case",
    "the set @xmath211 is connected and we choose @xmath222 to be its subset characterized by the property @xmath244 . the only point in @xmath222 with @xmath122 is exactly the equilibrium point @xmath221 , and so if @xmath245 the solution is forced to approach the equilibrium since @xmath93 is monotone ; if by contradiction @xmath186 had a strictly positive limit , we could argue as before to find @xmath238 and @xmath246 and so @xmath93 must necessarily converge to zero .",
