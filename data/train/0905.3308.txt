    "the light scalar mesons represent nowadays one of the hottest topics in hadronic physics . despite the growing consensus on the existence of a complete light scalar nonet , comprising the @xmath0(600 ) (",
    "alias @xmath1 ) , @xmath2(800 ) ( alias @xmath3 ) , @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath0(980 ) , which are now all included @xcite in the pdg tables , their interpretation and possible dynamical origin in the context of qcd - inspired methods and models remains controversial .",
    "moreover , their classification with respect to the intermediate scalars @xmath0(1370 ) , @xmath2(1430 ) , @xmath4(1450 ) and @xmath0(1500 ) @xcite is also subject to continued debate . for a brief historical discussion of the main theoretical and phenomenological approaches to the light scalars and the corresponding references , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work , the successful multichannel description of the light scalar mesons in ref .",
    "@xcite is further generalised by including , besides the usual pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( pp ) channels , also all vector - vector ( vv ) @xcite and scalar - scalar ( ss ) channels comprising light mesons .",
    "this is crucial for an extension of the applicability of the approach to energies well above 1  gev , so as to make more reliable predictions for the intermediate scalar resonances as well .",
    "we shall study the scalar mesons in the framework of the resonance - spectrum - expansion ( rse ) model @xcite , in which mesons in non - exotic channels scatter via an infinite set of intermediate @xmath5-channel @xmath6 states , i.e. , a kind of regge propagators @xcite .",
    "the confinement spectrum for these bare @xmath6 states can , in principle , be chosen freely , but in all successful phenomenological applications so far we have used a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) spectrum with flavour - indepedent frequency , as in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of the separability of the effective meson - meson interaction , the rse model can be solved in closed form . the relevant born and one - loop diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ bornoneloop ] ,    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     for @xmath7 , the vv channels that couple to @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while the ss channels are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath14 only .",
    "we fit the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 to sets of @xmath22-wave @xmath23 phase shifts compiled by bugg and surovtsev @xcite , which yield a somewhat larger scattering length than in ref .",
    "@xcite , viz .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmaf0a0 ] , left - hand plot , together with the curve from ref .",
    "@xcite , where only pp channels were included and somewhat lower data were used just above the @xmath23 threshold .",
    "all three fits are good up to 1  gev , with only small differences among them .",
    "thereabove , the vv and ss channels clearly produce very substantial effects , though overshooting between 1.2 and 1.6  gev .",
    "possible improvements are discussed below . with all channels",
    "included , we find the first four isoscalar poles at ( all in mev ) + @xmath25 , + @xmath26 + moreover , there is an extra broad state at @xmath27 mev , probably of a dynamical origin .",
    "the present predictions for the @xmath0(1370 ) and the @xmath0(1500 ) are clear improvements with respect to the case with pp and vv channels only ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , 1st paper ) .",
    "in particular , the extra pole found here might help to explain the experimental difficulties with the @xmath0(1370 ) and @xmath0(1500 ) .      in the isotriplet case",
    ", we fit @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as well as the pseudoscalar mixing angle , to the @xmath4(980 ) line shape , just as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but now with the vv ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and ss ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath18 ) channels added .",
    "thus , the quality of the fit is slightly improved , though the differences with the pp and pp+vv cases are hardly visible in fig .",
    "[ sigmaf0a0 ] , right - hand plot .",
    "the poles we find are @xmath33  mev ( second sheet ) for the @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath34  mev for the @xmath4(1450 ) , which are very reasonable values @xcite .      adding the vector ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and scalar ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) channels in the isodoublet sector does not allow a stable fit to be obtained .",
    "moreover , the lass data are known to violate unitarity above 1.3 gev .",
    "so we just fit up to 1.3  gev , with only the pp channels , getting parameters very close to the isoscalar case , including a reasonable pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "see further the conclusions for possible remedies . from the present pp fit we find the pole postions @xmath38  mev for the @xmath3 and @xmath39  mev for the @xmath2(1430 ) , which are again reasonable values @xcite",
    "the preliminary results in this study indicate that a good description of both the light and the intermediate scalar mesons is feasible in the rse , by taking into account additional sets of coupled channels that should become relevant at higher energies . however , some problems persist , like the too slow rise and subsequent overshooting of the @xmath7 @xmath23 phase shift above 1  gev , and the mentioned fitting problems in the isodoublet case .",
    "a possible cause of these difficulties is the assumed sharpness of several thresholds involving broad resonances in their turn , such as @xmath16 , @xmath10 , @xmath35 , etc . , which may result in too drastic effects at the opening of these channels .",
    "we are now studying ways to account for final - state resonances having non - zero widths , without destroying unitarity .",
    "it might also turn out to be necessary to consider more general transition potentials .",
