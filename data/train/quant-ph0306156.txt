    "due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is different from classical cryptography in that an unknown quantum state is in principle not known unless it is disturbed , rather than the conjectured difficulty of computing certain functions .",
    "the first published protocol , proposed in 1984  @xcite , is called bb84 after its inventors ( c. h. bennett and g. brassard . ) for a history of the subject , one may see e.g. @xcite . in this protocol , the participants ( alice and bob ) wish to agree on a secret key about which no eavesdropper ( eve ) can obtain significant information .",
    "alice sends each bit of the secret key in one of a set of conjugate bases which eve does not know , and this key is protected by the impossibility of measuring the state of a quantum system simultaneously in two conjugate bases . since then , studies on qkd are extensive .",
    "most of the entanglement assisted qkd protocols such as the lo - chau protocol@xcite are not so practical compared with the prepare - and - measure protocols such as bb84@xcite , 6-state protocol@xcite , the gottesman - lo protocol@xcite and so on because normally the entanglement assisted protocols require a quantum storage which is generally believed to be technically difficult .",
    "however , producing the maximally entangled pairs is not a problem by our current technology .",
    "maximally entangled pairs in polarization space can be robustly produced by the type two spontaneous parametric down conversion(spdc)@xcite .",
    "the proposed qkd protocol in this work does not require any quantum storage , though it uses the entanglement pairs and the collective measurement .",
    "the collective measurement can be done by using a polarizing beam splitter as we shall show in the section of `` experimental realization '' .",
    "therefore it is practically implementable by the currently existing technology .    normally , the channel for quantum bit transmission is noisy .",
    "the error to a qubit caused by the channel noise can be divided into @xmath0 errors , which represent for a bit flip error only , a phase flip error only and both error , respectively . the detected bit ( or phase ) flip error rate is the summation of @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) error rate and @xmath3 error rate .",
    "the most natural noisy channel is the symmetric channel , i.e. , the @xmath4 errors are equally distributed .",
    "one can take advantage of this type of symmetric channel in the qkd protocol@xcite . to be sure that the channel noise is symmetric",
    ", one must use 6-state protocol . in the bb84 protocol ,",
    "since the @xmath3 error can never be detected or deduced , we have to assume the worst case of zero @xmath3 error@xcite .",
    "this is why the 4-state protocol can only tolerate a lower error rate than 6-state protocol .",
    "this is the reason that the largest tolerable bit flip error rate or phase flip error rate for bb84 protocol is @xmath5 , lower than that of 6-state protocol , which is @xmath6@xcite .",
    "however , in our entanglement assisted protocol , the channel flipping rate upper bound of @xmath5 for the 4-state protocol is broken . the tolerable channel bit - flip and phase - flip rate",
    "is raised to @xmath7 for the symmetric channel .",
    "this is not a strange result if we consider an entanglement purification protocol with bit flip error rejection and phase flip error rejection alternately : even though @xmath3 error is never detected or deduced , the tolerable bit flip rate or phase flip rate can be as high as @xmath6 for the entanglement distillation .",
    "in such a case one does not have to make sure of the @xmath3 rate , he can check the bit flip rate and phase flip rate @xmath8 the purification .",
    "if initially the error rate is indeed symmetrically distributed and the total flipping rate is less than @xmath9 , he must be able to distill highly pure entangled state finally .",
    "this means , with the real entanglement purification , a 4-state protocol can tolerate a flipping rate of @xmath6 @xmath10 the channel noise is symmetric .",
    "( one does not have to test whether the channel noise is symmetric in the protocol , alice and bob just go ahead to make the purification even though the rate of @xmath1 and the rate of @xmath2 are larger than @xmath5 . if the channel @xmath11 symmetric , he will be able to verify that both bit flip rate and phase flip rate are 0 after the purification ) . in our entanglement",
    "assisted protocol , the tolerable bit flip rate or phase flip rate for the 6-state protocol is also raised to @xmath12 .",
    "our entanglement assisted protocol can tolerate the highest error rate among all proven secure prepare - and - measure protocols raised so far for both 4-state case and 6-state case .",
    "practically speaking , a quantum channel is normally noisy therefore the raw key string with bob and the string with alice are normally not identical .",
    "moreover , it is possible that , in the case alice and bob try to make the quantum key distribution , the channel noise could actually come from eve . in such a case",
    "the raw key can be significantly correlated with eve s quantum state . even in the case that no bit flip or phase",
    "flip is detected on the subset of the check bits , the raw key is still not completely reliable or secure because there could be still a few bit flips or phase flips for the code bits which are unchecked . to obtain the highly reliable and secure key",
    ", one has to take the error correction ( ec ) and privacy amplification ( pa ) to the raw key and then use the final key which should be unconditionally secure and perfectly reliable .",
    "although the classical ec can be used to remove all bit - value errors ( with a high probability ) therefore to help alice and bob obtain a reliable key , it s not transparent that whether the classical pa can really work here : eve may first store her qubits which are correlated with the raw key . after alice and bob complete the ec and pa , she then takes an optimized measurement to her qubits directly attacking the final key .",
    "a strict mathematical proof for the unconditional security is non - trivial@xcite .",
    "the security proof of qkd is greatly simplified if one connects this with the quantum entanglement purification protocol ( epp)@xcite . the main idea is conceptually simple and clear : alice and bob first share a number of raw entanglement pairs and then purify them to almost maximally entangled pairs and measure each of them to obtain the final key@xcite . the strict mathematical security proof with epp",
    "was given by lo and chau@xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was then shown by shor and preskill @xcite that lo - chau entanglement purification based protocol can be reduced to the quantum error correction ( qec ) protocol with one - way communication and the qec protocol is equivalent to bb84 protocol followed by the classical ec and pa done by decoding a classical css code .",
    "shor - preskill protocol@xcite works as long as the measured bit flip error and phase flip error rates are less than 11% , the point at which the shannon rate hits 0 . note that this threshold is lower than that of certain epp protocols with two - way communications ( 2-epp ) : the 2-epp with error rejection works as long as the summation of measured bit error and flip error rates are less than a 50% .",
    "in such a case , alice and bob randomly choose two pairs and measure the parity of 2 qubits in each side and discard both pairs if the parities disagree and keep one pair and discard the other pair if the parities agree with each other .",
    "in such a way , the bit flip error is reduced if they measure the parity in @xmath13 basis ; the phase flip error is reduced if they measure the parity in @xmath14 basis .",
    "x , y and z represents the basis in the eigenstates of operator @xmath15 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "the vector representation for the two level state is @xmath16 .",
    "this 2-epp with error rejection done in both z basis and x basis can not be reduced to a classical protocol . in a classical protocol ,",
    "alice just sends bob the qubits prepared in x or z ( or y ) basis randomly and then they carry out epp task as if they were sharing a number of raw entangled pairs . or equivalently , in a classicalized protocol , alice had measured her halves of the entangled pairs before the protocol was started .",
    "they can still do the parity comparison on z basis , but they will not be able to do so in x basis : they are never able to know what the parity values should be if they had really used entangled pairs here therefore they do nt know whether they should discard both bits or keep one bit .",
    "very recently , motivated for higher bit error rate tolerance and higher efficiency , gottesman and lo@xcite studied the classicalization of 2-epp .",
    "it has been shown there that a 2-epp can be classicalized iff their action after the phase parity comparison is deterministic .",
    "in such a case they can carry out the task as if they were doing the 2-epp on entangled pairs . based on this observation ,",
    "a new qkd protocol was given there@xcite with partially two way communications : in removing the bit flip errors , the error - rejection method is used with two way communication ; in removing the phase flip error , the error @xmath17 method is used with one way communication , i.e. , alice asked bob to measure the syndrome of certain randomly chosen 3 qubits and bob will use the majority rule to decide whether to take a phase flip operation to one of the 3 qubits .",
    "this method has increased the tolerable bit error rate of noisy channel to 18.9@xmath18 and 26.4@xmath18 for 4-state qkd and 6-state qkd , respectively .",
    "very recently , these values have been upgraded to 20@xmath18 and 27.4@xmath18 by chau@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a revised scheme which is also uncinditionally secure and which can further increase these thresholds on bit error rates given the independent channel errors .",
    "we propose to let alice send bob the quantum states randomly chosen from @xmath19 .",
    "when bob receives them , he first decodes each two - qubit code to the one - qubit state ( a bb84 state ) and then carry out the rest tasks of ec and pa . in decoding",
    ", bob discards those codes which contains one bit - flip error therefore after decoding the phase - flip error for the accepted bits are greatly decreased .",
    "as we are going to show , we may take this advantage to increase the threshold of the tolerable bit error rate caused by the s - channel .",
    "the advantage of a higher tolerable error rate is limitted to the cases where the 2-qubit qpfer code works , e.g. , in the case that the channel noise is uncorrelated . but",
    "security part of our protocol is unconditional , i.e. , it is secure under whatever types of attack . in other words , alice and bob",
    "do nt care about the actual noise pattern ( correlated or uncorrelated ) in the qkd , they just test the error rate after decoding and then go ahead to distill the final key by our protocol .",
    "the final key is always secure no matter what type of noise has been actually happened to the raw qubits .",
    "subtle points for the unconditional security with conditional advantage of the protocol is given in the following section .",
    "in particular , the protocol is totally different from the almost useless protocol which is only secure with uncorrelated channel noise .",
    "to a qkd protocol , one may evaluate it by several criterion , e.g. , the security , the efficiency and the key rate .",
    "the unconditional security is the first important thing . without this prpoerty ,",
    "the protocol is almost useless even if it has other advantages such as a high key rate .",
    "after all , the reason we use @xmath20 key distribution is due to the temptation of its _ unconditional security_. in this logic , a @xmath21 secure qkd protocol with unverifiable condition for security is useless , because it is actually insecure and has lost the assumed advantage to a classical key distribution .",
    "for example if a new protocol is proposed with advantages in efficiency or economy , but the security is only proved based on the assumption of individual attack , this new protocol is useless unless the proof of unconditional security is completed , i.e. , the proof of the security under whatever type of attack .",
    "an unconditionally secure qkd protocol means that eve s information to the final key is exponentially close to 0 . to alice and bob , if they carry out that protocol , the worst result there is that alice and bob may get 0 bit for the final key , i.e. , when the channel noise ( including the disturbance caused by eve s attack ) is higher than the threshold of the protocol itself .",
    "the `` efficiency '' is defined by the threshold of the channel noise for the protocol .",
    "if the channel noise is larger than that , alice and bob will obtain zero bit for their final key . in almost all proven unconditionally secure protocols",
    "so far , the efficiency is dependent on the channel error rate , but it is independent of the channel error pattern itself , i.e. , no matter it is a coherent error or uncorrelated error , the threshold is the same .",
    "these protocols are unconditional secure with threshold value of noise which is universal to all noise patterns , correlated or uncorrelated . here in our protocol",
    ", the threshold is dependent on the channel error pattern while the security is independent of the error pattern ( which is required by the term `` unconditional security '' ) .",
    "note that our protocol is totally different from the ones with a conditional security .",
    "our protocol is unconditionally secure with a conditional advantage in noise threshold .",
    "security proof of a qkd protocol is normally related to the channel noise . here",
    "we shall use the term `` s - channel '' for the physical channel which is supposed to transmit the qubits from alice to bob .",
    "this s - channel can be an optical fiber , or can be just the nature .",
    "we shall use the term `` r - channel '' for the actual channel in the qkd , the noise of `` r - channel '' is supposed to be under control of eve . in the security proof . in particular , if there is no eve .",
    ", r - channel is just s - channel .",
    "suppose alice and bob decide to do qkd through a certain s - channel ( e.g. , optical fiber f ) by using gottesman - lo protocol@xcite .",
    "before they do so they have been very sure of the propeties of their s - channel noise .",
    "they find the channel noise is all independent to each qubit and the bit error rate of that s - channel is @xmath22 .",
    "( it is to many people s intution that the errors should be independent if the different qubits are spatially separated sufficiently .",
    "also we can choose to use the type of fiber which only causes independent errors to qubits . ) in such a case , if we are limitted to the previously proposed 4-state prepare - and - measure protocols , we can do nothing for the quantum key distribution because the error rate is larger than the thresholds of all those protocols .",
    "however , in our protocol , alice will first encode each bb84 qubit by a 2-qubit quantum error - rejection code and then send each quantum code to bob .",
    "bob will first take the parity check and decoding after ha receives the codes .",
    "he will test the error rate and distill the final key with alice @xmath8 decoding . due to the fault tolerance property of the error rejection code , the error rate of the raw bits after decoding",
    "is expected to be reduced and the net effect here is that our 4-state protocol can tolerate an error rate up to @xmath7 for the s - channel . in the supposed case of @xmath22 error rate for the symmetric s - channel where",
    "all errors are independent , our protocol will still work .",
    "the advantage of a higher error threshold is not an unconditional advantage .",
    "it is only for the cases where the 2-qubit error rejection code indeed works .",
    "one example is that the channel only causes uncorrelated errors .",
    "however , the security of our protocol is unconditional .",
    "that is to say , no matter what type of attack eve . may use , the final key obtained by our protocol is always secure . in a real qkd process the qubits could be transmitted through eve . or the property of s - channel could be changed due to eve s attack therefore the 2-qubit error - rejection code does not work properly as what is expected . in such a case , after decoding , alice and bob will find that the error rate is unexpectedly high and they will choose to either abort all the raw bits or continue the rest steps of the protocol and obtain a shorter final key to which eve.s information is exponentially close to 0 .",
    "but in cases there is no eve . , or eve.s attack is insignificant , the 2-bit error - rejection code works perfectly or almost perfectly , the advantage of our protocol appears : one can obtain the final key in the case that the s - channel noise is higher than the thresholds of all previously known secure prepare - and - measure protocols .",
    "if eve always disturbs the qubits very sigficantly , our protocol will not work at all even though the error rate of s - channel is lower than the threshold .",
    "however , in such a case no protocol will work .",
    "a quantitative comparison of different protocols on eve s cost to destroy a protocol or to shorten the final key is not a topic of this work .",
    "there are many ways to do entanglement purification .",
    "however , not all of them can be used for the security proof of a qkd protocol without using quantum storage . to carry out such a task one must first study an entanglement purification based qkd protocol and",
    "then show that the protocol is classicalizable , i.e. , to show that it is equivalent to the case where alice measures all her halves of entangled pairs initially and continue with all other steps in the protocol .",
    "different types of epp may tolerate different flipping rates of the channel .",
    "we now first analyse the reason why the currently existing protocols@xcite does not reach the theoretically allowed threshold of the channel flipping rate . to prove a secure qkd protocol",
    ", one may first consider an entanglement purification protocol and then find out the corresponding qkd protocol based on that .",
    "in general , one has two simple ways to purify entangled pairs shared by spatially separated parties , alice and bob .",
    "one method is the error-@xmath23@xcite : the raw pairs are randomly divided into many 2-pair groups . to each group ,",
    "alice and bob measure the parity on each side .",
    "if they obtain the same parity value , they discard the target pair and keep the control pair ( see fig .",
    "[ cnot0 ] ) .",
    "if the parity values are different , they discard both pairs . in doing the parity check , they can choose the measurement basis of @xmath24 to reduce the bit flip errors or the basis of @xmath25 to reduce the phase flip errors .",
    "suppose the initially shared raw pairs between alice and bob bear the @xmath26 errors are @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath28 .",
    "after one round of bit - flip error - rejection , the error rate for the survived pairs is changing by the following iteration formula as given by chau@xcite : @xmath29 exchange @xmath30 and @xmath31 above we can obtain the iteration formula by phase error - rejection operation . by taking the error - rejection operation alternately in @xmath13 basis and @xmath14 basis for many rounds",
    ", one can always distill out maximally entangled pairs asymptotically from the raw state @xmath32 if @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this is to say , with the error - rejection method , the theoretical upper bound of tolerable channel flipping rate for qkd distribution can be reached . for the symmetric channel",
    ", the bit - flip rate or the phase - flip rate can be as high as @xmath6 no matter whether we use the 4-state protocol or 6-state protocol .",
    "however , the error - rejection method above can not be clasicalized to the prepare - and - measure qkd protocol since if alice had measured her halves in z basis initially , alice and bob would have no way to take phase - flip error - rejection .",
    "note that the error - rejection method means they have to decide whether they should keep one bit or discard both bits according to the measurement result .",
    "to overcome this barrier , gottesman and lo proposed to use the error-@xmath17 method to reduce the phase - flip error : they @xmath35 a possible error by @xmath36_2 $ ] code instead of discarding the the corrupted pairs , once a possible error is detected .",
    "to do so , alice and bob randomly choose 3 pairs in one group .",
    "they each measure the parity of qubits 2,3 and qubit 1,2 and compare both values ( fig .",
    "[ pstep ] ) . after the comparison , they decide whether to take a flip operation to pair 1 .",
    "they keep pair 1 and discard pair 2 and pair 3 . with a high probability that pair one is now free of phase flip error if the parity checks are done in @xmath14 basis",
    ". however the tolerable initial error rate is decreased with this method towards the distillation of maximally entangled pairs .",
    "_ this implies that the error - rejection can be more effective than error - correction in the entanglement distillation . _    in gottesman - lo qkd protocol , alice and bob distill the classical bits as if they were distilling the entangled pairs : no one knows whether alice had measured her halves of the entangled pairs initially .",
    "therefore the security of the protocol is equivalent to that in a real entanglement distillation protocol , which has been proved to be unconditionally secure@xcite .",
    "gottesman - lo protocol reduces the bit flip error by error - rejection and reduces the phase flip error by error - correction .",
    "although in the case of real entanglement distillation , alice may often need to phase flip certain qubit according to the parity comparison result for phase - flip error - correction in the entanglement purification protocol .",
    "however , if the final purpose is to set up the faithful and secure key only , alice need not really take any phase flip . instead , she may simply use the parity of randomly chosen 3 bits as the new bit value after `` error - correction '' ( see fig.[pstep ] ) .",
    "the phase flip does not affect the final bit result therefore omitting the phase flip will not affect the reliability of the final key .",
    "that is , the final key is as faithful as that in the case alice takes phase flip to her qubits as required by the standard entanglement purification .",
    "moreover , one can also find that omitting the phase flip operation does not affect the security either .",
    "consider the case that alice never takes phase flip to her qubit but she keeps the information in the mind that which qubit should be phase flipped and then continue the distillation , they will finally obtain @xmath37 . each @xmath38 is",
    "either @xmath39 or @xmath40 and alice explicitly knows the state of each pair ( with a probability exponentially close to 1 ) . that is to say ,",
    "if alice never takes any phase flip , alice and bob will share a product of different maximally entangled state .",
    "note that the shared pairs are in a pure state .",
    "therefore those shared pairs , with a probability exponentially close to 1 , are unentangled with any third party .",
    "the security in such a case is totally equivalent to the case where all shared pairs are in state @xmath39 .",
    "further , even alice never keeps any information in her mind on which qubit should be phase flipped , the security is unchanged . because even in such a case , the finally distilled pairs are also unentangled with any third party .",
    "the only thing that is important here is that alice would be able to know the state of finally distilled pairs if she had remembered the information on which qubit should be phase flipped .",
    "one may further reduce the above protocol . taking the fact that the phase flip operation can actually be ignored",
    ", alice can then choose to measure each of her halves of epr pair in @xmath13 basis initially and send the other halves to bob and then carry out the same entanglement purification scheme as if they were sharing the entangled pairs .",
    "this reduction should not affect the reliability of bob s final key because it does not affect any bit value in @xmath13 basis . note that the operation commutes with all operations taken by alice latter on .",
    "this reduction should be as secure as before because eve will never know whether alice had measured her halves of epr pairs in the beginning , even with the full collaboration with bob .",
    "suppose the reduction at this step is insecure .",
    "we have already known that the final key is secure if alice had not measured her halves of pairs .",
    "then we shall get the confliction that eve . and bob will be able to know whether alice had measured her qubits in the beginning by checking whether bob s final key is significantly correlated with eve s assumed key .    from the above analysis we spot one important fact in gottesman - lo protocol@xcite and its modified version@xcite : alice and bob",
    "are only allowed to take error-@xmath17 but not allowed to take error-@xmath23 operation to treat the phase flip error , otherwise it can not be classicalized .",
    "but error-@xmath23 operation can be more effective in removing errors .",
    "this is the reason why the error rate threshold can not reach the theoretically allowed value , i.e. , the threshold for the real entanglement distillation with all error - rejection method .",
    "to improve the tolerable channel error rate threshold in quantum key distribution , one may naturally consider the possibility of using error - rejection method to reduce the phase error also .",
    "naively , one may consider the real 2-epp .",
    "but that requires the quantum storage which is obviously impractical with our current technology .",
    "however , with the quantum error - rejection code as we are going into , one can take the error - rejection @xmath41 therefore any quantum storage is unnecessary .",
    "however , if we want to use quantum phase error - rejection code to remove the phase flip error in all rounds , we must then use a large concatenated quantum code which is also impractical . keeping this point in mind",
    ", we choose to use quantum error - rejection only at the first round therefore we only need a 2-bit quantum code to encode each initial qubits with alice : @xmath42 here the second @xmath43 state qubit in the left hand side of the arrow is the ancilla for the encoding .",
    "this code is not assumed to reduce the errors to qubits in all cases .",
    "but in the case that the channel noise is uncorrelated or nearly uncorrelated , it works effectively .",
    "we shall consider the ideal case that the channel errors are uncorrelated here .",
    "therefore the initial perfect epr pair @xmath39 with alice is encoded by the following formula before sending half of it bob over noisy channel : @xmath44=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[|0\\rangle_a(|0\\rangle_{b1}|0\\rangle_{b2}+|1\\rangle_{b1}|1\\rangle_{b2 } ) + |1\\rangle_a(|0\\rangle_{b1}|0\\rangle_{b2}-|1\\rangle_{b1}|1\\rangle_{b2 } ) \\right]\\label{epair}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alice then sends qubits b1 and b2 to bob . in receiving them ,",
    "bob first takes a parity check , i.e. measures @xmath45 .",
    "note that this measurement does not destroy the code state itself .",
    "moreover , any linear superposition of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is an eigenstate of @xmath45 with eigenvalue 0 ; any linear superposition of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is an eigenstate of @xmath45 with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "if he obtains 1 , alice and bob discards the code , if he obtains 0 , bob decodes the code : he takes a measurement in @xmath14 basis to one qubit ( say , @xmath50 ) , if he obtains @xmath51 , he takes a hadamard transformation @xmath52 to the other qubit ( b2 ) ; if he obtains @xmath53 for qubit b1 , he takes the hadamard transformation to qubit b2 and then flips qubit b2 in z basis .",
    "in such a way , alice and bob may share the raw pairs of qubit a and b2 . the phase flip error to the survived raw pairs",
    "will be decreased .",

    "in such a case , the state after decoding is exactly @xmath39 .",

    "suppose bob takes measurement in x basis to qubit @xmath50 for the decoding .",
    "from the formula above we can see that the state for qubits a and b2 will be collapsed to @xmath60 if he obtains @xmath51 for qubit b1 , after a hadamard transformation , the shared pair is changed to @xmath39 for sure . qubits a and b2 will be collapsed to @xmath61 if he obtains @xmath53 for qubit b1 .",
    "in such a case , he will first take a hadamard transformation to b2 and then flip it in z basis .",
    "after these operations , the shared pair is also changed back to state @xmath39 for sure .",
    "if one of the transmitted qubit bears a bit flip error ( including both @xmath1 and @xmath3 error ) while the other transmitted qubit does not bear the bit flip error ( e.g. , it can be of no error or of @xmath2 error ) , the code will be discarded for sure after the parity check .",
    "the probability for this type of event is @xmath62 .",
    "if both transmitted qubits bear bit flip errors with arbitrary phase flip errors , or none of them suffer a bit flip error with arbitrary phase flips , the 2-qubit code will pass the parity check and be accepted . in such a case alice and bob will share a wrong state after decoding . however , the probability for such cases are small .",
    "we list the probability distribution for all possible states after decoding in the following table :    [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use @xmath63 to denote both @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the most left column above .",
    "there are other types of joint errors to the two transmitted qubits besides those listed in the above table .",
    "however , all codes with those types of unlisted joint channel errors will be discarded after bob s parity check operation .",
    "after renormalize the probability distribution for each term in the above table we can obtain the error rate distribution for the survived raw pairs shared by alice and bob .",
    "@xmath66 with this formula , the phase flip error to the shared raw pairs is obviously reduced .",
    "the formula is similar to the error - rejection formula by directly measuring the parity of two pairs on each side .",
    "therefore such a code can be more effective than @xmath36_2 $ ] error correction code in reducing phase - flip errors and can cause advantages to the qkd protocols .",
    "note that it is a bit subtle that the phase error to the decoded state is caused by bit - flip channel errors .",

    "the channel noise is not unconditionally reduced , it is based on the investigated properties of the s - channel itself . at the time we are really carrying out qkd , eve",
    "may attack it and the assumed properties is not necessarily true .",
    "but we still believe that the protocol will work in the way as it is assumed in most of the cases for the reasons we have addressed before .",
    "it s a reasonable assumption that it should be an advantage if we have a way to decrease the noise of the s - channel , even though in principle eve .",
    "may do everything to the channel in qkd .",
    "we have proposed an entanglement assisted protocol for quantum key distribution .",
    "the protocol is unconditionally secure with a conditional advantage of an improved threshold of the channel error rate . given the uncorrelated noise of s - channel , in 4-state case , the tolerable bit flip or phase flip rate is @xmath7 ; in the 6 state case , the values are increased to @xmath12 , if the noise is symmetric .",
    "the initial 2-qubit entangled state can be produced through spdc process@xcite .",
    "bob s quantum parity check and decoding can be done with a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "obviously , all devices appeared in our proposed scheme are just ordinary devices in linear optics .",
    "there are also some loosen ends for our protocol in practical realization . in the spdc process , there are also some multi - pair emission with small probability",
    ". this type of emission will affect the security that should be taken into consideration for the security proof for a practical entanglement assisted qkd protocol with spdc process .",
    "we believe this can be solved in the similar idea for the case of imperfection of the single photon source for the bb84 scheme . we have neither considered the devices imperfections , e.g. , the dark counting of the photon detectors .",
    "neither have we considered the trojan horse attack to the protocol .",
    "similar to other qkd proposals@xcite , here the tolerable upper bound for channel error rate is calculated asymptotically . in practice ,",
    "the number of qubits sent to bob is always finite . with the statistical fluctuation",
