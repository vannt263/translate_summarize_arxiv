    "the medium modifications of mesons with strangeness such as kaons and antikaons can be studied in connection to heavy - ion experiments for energies around 1 - 2 agev @xcite .",
    "one surprising observation in c@xmath2c and ni@xmath2ni collisions @xcite is that the @xmath1 multiplicity and that of @xmath3 are of the same order of magnitude although in @xmath4 collisions the @xmath3 multiplicity exceeds the @xmath1 one by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude at the same energy above threshold .",
    "another interesting observation is that the @xmath0 ratio stays almost constant for c@xmath2c , ni@xmath2ni and au@xmath2au collisions for 1.5 agev @xcite .",
    "both observations could be interpreted to be a manifestation of an attractive @xmath1 optical potential . on the other hand , equal centrality dependence for the",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons has also been observed in au@xmath2au and pb@xmath2pb reactions at 1.5 agev @xcite .",
    "actually , the independence of centrality of the @xmath0 ratio was claimed to indicate that no in - medium effects were needed in order to explain the experimental ratio @xcite . however , the concept of `` broad - band equilibration '' was introduced by brown et al .",
    "@xcite in order to explain the centrality independence but including medium modifications of antikaons .    in this work",
    "we study the implications of introducing the @xmath1 spectral density for the @xmath0 ratio in order to address the above mentioned issues .",
    "we present a brief description of the statistical models which are applied for the calculation of the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "statistical models are based on the assumption that the particle ratios in relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be described by two parameters , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath5 and the temperature @xmath6 @xcite .    therefore , by using canonical strangeness conservation and taking into account the most relevant contributions in the @xmath7 sectors , the inverse ratio @xmath8 is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicate the different one - particle partition functions for @xmath11 . in order to balance the number of @xmath3 , the main contribution in the @xmath12 sector comes from @xmath13 and @xmath14 hyperons and , in a smaller proportion , from @xmath1 mesons and @xmath15 resonances . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of @xmath1 is balanced by the presence of @xmath3 mesons .",
    "we finally observe that the ratio is determined by the relative abundance of @xmath16 baryons with respect to that of @xmath1 mesons .    in order to introduce in - medium and temperature effects",
    ", the particles involved in the calculation should be dressed accordingly . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the partition function reads @xmath17 which is built using a mean - field dispersion relation for the single - particle energies ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , while the resonance @xmath15 is described by a breit - wigner shape .    with regards to the @xmath1 meson ,",
    "two different prescriptions for the @xmath1 single - particle energy have been used .",
    "first , we use the mean - field approximation for the @xmath1 potential @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath1 single - particle potential in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach @xcite .",
    "the second approach incorporates the @xmath1 spectral density ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath20",
    "[ fig : ratio - dens ]     for @xmath21 within different approaches .",
    "right : different @xmath8 ratios using the full @xmath1 spectral density.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   for @xmath21 within different approaches .",
    "right : different @xmath8 ratios using the full @xmath1 spectral density.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - dens ] the inverse ratio @xmath8 is shown for two temperatures using different approaches for the dressing of the @xmath1 meson : free gas ( dot - dashed lines ) , the on - shell approach ( dotted lines ) and using the @xmath1 spectral density including s - waves ( long - dashed lines ) or both s- and p - waves ( solid lines ) .",
    "the ratio grows with @xmath22 as we increase the density although it tends to bend down after the initial increase when the in - medium @xmath1 properties are considered . actually , when the full spectral density is used ( solid lines ) , a flat region as a function of the density is observed .",
    "this is due to the increased attraction produced by the @xmath23 excitations present in the low - energy region of the @xmath1 spectral density .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the `` broad - band equilibration '' advocated by brown et al.@xcite .",
    "however , this behaviour was found in ref .",
    "@xcite using a mean - field model through a compensation of the increased attractive mean - field @xmath1 potential with the increase in the baryonic chemical potential as density grows , which is not observed in our mean - field approach .    in the framework of statistical models , one obtains the relation between the temperature and the chemical potential by fixing the @xmath8 ratio . in the l.h.s .",
    "[ fig : t - m ] we show , for the previous approaches , the values of temperature and chemical potential compatible with a value of @xmath21 , close to the experimental one for ni+ni collisions at 1.93 agev .",
    "similar to the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , the dot - dashed lines gives the free gas case .",
    "while the on - shell approach ( dotted line ) does not show the broad - band effect , a band of chemical potentials @xmath5 up to 850 mev for @xmath24 mev appears to be in accordance with the given ratio when both s- and p - wave contributions are taken into account ( solid line ) . however , in this case , the temperature is too low to be compatible with the experimental one and the corresponding freeze - out densities are too small .",
    "we can hardly speak of a `` broad band '' feature in the sense of that of brown et al . in the r.h.s .  of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - m ] we display the temperature and chemical potential for different values of the ratio when the full @xmath1 spectral density is used .",
    "a ratio of the order of @xmath25 seems to be the solution for a more plausible experimental temperature of @xmath26 mev .",
    "we therefore conclude that the strength of the low - energy region of the @xmath1 spectral density gives an enhanced production of @xmath1 compared to the experimental results .",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath1/@xmath3 ratio in the framework of statistical models considering the medium properties of antikaons .",
    "it is found that the determination of the temperature and baryonic chemical potential for a given ratio is very delicate depending on the approximation adopted for the @xmath1 self - energy . on the other hand , the `` broad - band equilibration '' advocated by brown ,",
    "rho and song is not accomplished in the on - shell approach .",
    "only when @xmath1 is described by the full spectral density we observe this broad - band .",
    "this is due to the coupling of the @xmath1 meson to @xmath23 states .",
    "however , the @xmath0 ratio is in excess by a factor of 2 with respect to the experimental value",
    ". only further studies on non - equilibrium evolution of @xmath1 in the medium could give some indications about the reduced number of @xmath1 that are observed experimentally .",
