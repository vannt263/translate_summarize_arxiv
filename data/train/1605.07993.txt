    "it can be seen that @xmath95 decreases monotonically over the transition region , suggesting a distribution of transition temperatures .",
    "there is , however , considerable structure in the temperature dependences of all the parameters , which we compare with the previously - reported transition temperatures  @xcite @xmath128  k , @xmath129  k , and @xmath130  k.    ( 1 )  from fig .  [ fig : mag - rates](a ) , with decreasing temperature @xmath95 becomes nonzero below 10  k rather than @xmath131 .",
    "there are inflection points in @xmath132 near 9  k and 8  k and saturation at @xmath96 below 7.5  k , i.e. , no structure at 7  k.    ( 2 )  recalling that the afm - phase pe relaxation rate  @xmath125 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - rates](b ) ] measures the strength of static fields ( in frequency units ) , the decrease of @xmath133 with increasing temperature from 2  k to 8  k is expected ; it is the temperature dependence of the order parameter in this region . the minimum at @xmath328  k and maximum at @xmath328.3  k suggest structural transitions in the spin order . they might be associated with an increase in magnetic volume fraction , since @xmath95 exhibits small additional increases with decreasing temperature at these temperatures [ fig .",

    "[ fig : mag - rates](c ) ] decreases from its low - temperature value above @xmath327  k , goes through a minimum near 8  k and a maximum near 8.5  k , and decreases to less than 1 above @xmath328.8  k. as noted above , a decrease of @xmath1 indicates broadening of the wings of the field distribution , i.e. , increasing probability of field values far from the median . not only is the volume fraction of the afm phase decreasing with increasing temperature , but the disorder within this volume is increasing .",

    "[ fig : mag - rates](d ) ] increases rapidly with decreasing temperature below @xmath329  k to a poorly - defined maximum at 88.5  k , and then decreases to a constant value @xmath135 from @xmath326  k down to 2  k. the maximum in the transition region suggests critical slowing down of spin fluctuations associated with the afm transition . of the parameters shown in fig .",

    "there is no evidence of static magnetism , ordered or disordered .",
    "the dynamic muon spin relaxation rate  @xmath7 exhibits a power - law temperature dependence  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , in the temperature range  100  mk2  k. this divergence is similar to that found in materials with a putative fm qcp , and is in strong disagreement with predictions by theories of quantum critical behavior due to either afm or valence fluctuations . with decreasing temperature @xmath7 passes through a broad maximum at @xmath3250  mk , which might restore agreement with predicted valence critical behavior at lower temperatures , but the divergence above 100  mk",
    "would then remain unexplained .",
    "further studies are necessary to clarify this situation .    for @xmath10",
    "the afm state is inhomogeneous , with a broad distribution of local fields at @xmath33 sites and no indication of a well - defined average field .",
    "the inhomogeneity increases in the temperature region  7.510  k , where the @xmath3sr data indicate the coexistence of magnetically ordered and paramagnetic phases .",
    "this is evidence that the scale of the inhomogeneity is meso- or macroscopic , since otherwise each muon would sample both phases and the relaxation function would not exhibit the two - component behavior described in sec .",
    "[ sec : trans ] .",
    "it is possible that fe substitution is not random , so that clustering leads to a distribution of phase transition temperatures .",
