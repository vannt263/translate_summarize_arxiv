    "classical dynamical systems can be classified into a hierarchy of deterministic randomness .",
    "we have well studied examples from integrable systems to bernoulli systems , from the regular to those that are in a coarse grained manner identical to stochastic processes .",
    "an important notion in this context is that of mixing , as exemplified in the now classic coke - rum mixture of arnold and avez @xcite .",
    "apart from the fundamental role it plays in deterministic randomness , alias chaos , it is the backbone of the foundations of classical statistical mechanics . while ergodicity is compatible with equilibrium , it is mixing that would ensure the drive to this state .",
    "quantum dynamical systems are not so neatly categorized .",
    "quantum mixing remains a difficult notion .",
    "there are specific examples where indeed mixing can be said to occur in the configuration space , in as much as any two spatial wavefunctions decay and decorrelate exactly as classical liouville phase space densities @xcite .",
    "yet these are rather special systems generally open and with a continuous spectra .",
    "they do not address the issue in more generic situations .",
    "the phenomenon of quantum suppression of classical chaos in diffusive systems is now well studied , and several localization mechanisms have been put forward which inhibit quantum mixing @xcite , yet the issues in the situation of `` hard chaos '' for bounded chaotic systems relaxing to an equilibrium have not been sufficiently addressed . .",
    "this paper studies quantum objects that are obviously connected to the twin issues of ergodicity and mixing in the classical limit . in the process",
    "we use models having a discrete spectra whose classical limit is known to be chaotic . the most convenient for our purposes is the quantization of two dimensional area preserving maps on the torus- a much studied subject .",
    "the hilbert space is then finite dimensional and we have fully all the contradictions between quantum and classical chaos , while retaining the attractive feature of being able to do the quantum mechanics up to machine precision and size .",
    "let the relevant classical phase space be @xmath0 .",
    "this could be for instance the energy shell on which the hamiltonian flow is restricted .",
    "we may formulate mixing either in terms of phase space functions or densities .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two subsets of the phase space such that they do not intersect .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the two characteristic functions of these subregions .",
    "let the flow integrated for a time @xmath5 be denoted by @xmath6 , this could be a continuous flow or a discrete map , we formulate this for the case of maps in which case @xmath5 is an integer .",
    "the invariant measure of the flow is denoted by @xmath7 , in the present context of area preserving maps this is simply the physical area of the phase space region .",
    "the central quantity of interest is the correlation between the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in more graphic language , as the subregion @xmath1 evolves with the motion the correlation is the fractional area of its intersection with the region @xmath2 .",
    "if in the long time limit this factorises into the fraction of the areas of @xmath1 and @xmath2 we have mixing . in other words",
    "the fraction of @xmath1 systems in @xmath2 is the fractional area of @xmath2 in the long time limit .",
    "@xmath10 mixing systems are a step above ergodic ones in the hierarchy of classical dynamical systems .",
    "ergodicity is the equality of the time average and phase space average of almost all points in the phase space .",
    "this can also be formulated as decorrelation on the average .",
    "thus a system is ergodic if @xmath11    classical mixing systems are characterized by a series of complex numbers or resonances that dictate the rate of decay of correlations .",
    "thus for purely hyperbolic or axiom a systems we can write @xmath12 the @xmath13 are the so called ruelle resonances and are in general complex numbers with negative real parts independent of the particular partitions @xmath1 and @xmath2 . explicit calculation of these resonances is a challenging part of dynamical systems theory ; there are special models which are isomorphic to finite markov processes for which these can be analytically found ; for example the multi - baker maps @xcite .    what we wish to study below are quantities in quantum mechanics",
    "that are naturally related to the classical correlation functions defined above .",
    "in particular we will analyze the long time behaviour of these functions as we expect there to be purely quantum effects in these regimes . for short times",
    "it is expected , and has been demonstrated , that the classical and quantum largely coincide @xcite .",
    "the long time behaviour is of course very interesting because equilibrium is an asymptotic ( in time ) property .",
    "just as there is an `` equilibrium '' classically , a state where complete decorrelation has been practically achieved , we will study the quantum equilibrium and the associated fluctuations which we will find has universal features in a limited manner and is often a sensitive measure of whether the classical limit is chaotic or not .",
    "the qualifications in the previous statement are necessary for reasons we will clarify below .",
    "the relevant dynamical space on quantization is a hilbert space @xmath14 . for regions of phase space",
    "we consider subspaces of the hilbert space . since we have in mind classical maps on the two torus ,",
    "let the hilbert space be of finite dimensionality @xmath15 .",
    "let there be two distinct density operators on @xmath14 ( may or may not be projection operators ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we will study the cases when these operators on @xmath14 have obvious classical limits as functions on the phase space .",
    "we will restrict ourselves initially , and largely , to the case when the operators are projection operators such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath15 dimensional identity matrix .",
    "classically this corresponds to choosing the partitions @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that @xmath20 .",
    "we sidestep the question of assigning an operator to a general subregion of phase space , and whether this is possible at all ( say through the wigner - weyl transform of the characteristic function ) , by restricting this study to particularly simple subspaces ( or density operators ) both of @xmath0 and on @xmath14 and going from the quantum to the classical instead of vice versa .",
    "choosing an `` arbitrary '' subspace ( or operator ) of @xmath14 obviously does not correspond to a proper subregion of the classical phase space and we will see that such subspaces do not provide interesting relaxation behaviors in that they do not distinguish between classically chaotic and regular motions .",
    "we may also construct operators out of coherent states that provide an adequate quantum equivalent of the characteristic functions .",
    "for instance if @xmath21 is the usual coherent state on the plane , we may consider @xmath22 we will finally use such operators after adapting them to the toral phase space .",
    "if we use pure states , say @xmath23 , we can construct the density operators as @xmath24 .",
    "let the dimensionality of the subspace @xmath1 be @xmath25 ; then @xmath26 .",
    "the fractions @xmath27 and @xmath28 determine the relative sizes of the partitions and we will assume below that @xmath29 , that is the subspaces are large enough to contain very many states and be considered the quantum equivalent of a finite ( much larger than @xmath30 ) region of phase space .",
    "we will mostly use projection operators that are diagonal in the position basis . in this case",
    "the classical region corresponding to @xmath31 is the rectangle @xmath32 and the region corresponding to @xmath17 is the rectangle @xmath33 , as the phase space is taken to be the unit torus @xmath34 .",
    "we now introduce the dynamics as an unitary operator @xmath35 acting on the states of @xmath14 .",
    "the central quantity of interest is then @xmath36 which gives us the overlap of the subspace @xmath1 propagated for time @xmath5 with the subspace @xmath2 .",
    "we may note that this is an important and natural physical quantity to study and has appeared before in several contexts , for example ref .",
    "it can also be viewed as an analogue of landauer conductance for bound systems and as such should be of considerable importance in quantum transport .",
    "if in fact there is factorization in time then @xmath37 must be compared with @xmath38 .",
    "the operators @xmath35 used in this paper are briefly described in the appendix and have been essentially described before .",
    "since @xmath35 has a discrete and finite spectrum , the correlation can only be a finite sum of purely oscillatory terms and can therefore display decay only over short time scales ( of the order of heisenberg time ) .",
    "the decorrelation is therefore not expected . as an extreme quantum example if we consider the case when the projection operators are constructed out of the basis functions of @xmath35 the correlation is zero for all time .",
    "this is an extreme case and for instance it is not clear what the classical limit is of the wigner - weyl transform of projection operators constructed out of such a basis .",
    "we will consider `` generic '' subspaces and projection operators and any claim of universality made below has to be viewed with this caveat . we may note that this plagues random matrix theory descriptions of eigenfunctions as well , as it involves basis dependent quantities . here",
    "the basis dependence enters as the basis in which the projection operators are diagonal .",
    "it was suggested earlier using quantized multi - baker maps that the quantum correlation function approached the classical correlation function in the classical limit corresponding here to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "certain remarkable features of quantum relaxation were noted there including relaxation localization and effects of symmetries on transport . here",
    "we wish to study the fluctuation properties more closely and uncover possible universal features .",
    "therefore we study rather standard models like the taylor - chirikov ( standard ) map @xcite , the kicked harper system @xcite and the baker map @xcite although most of these models do not have explicit expressions for the classical ruelle resonances and are probably not axiom a systems ( except the baker map ) .",
    "however it is very reasonable to assume that in certain well known parameter regimes they can be for all practical purposes mixing systems .    normalizing the correlation so that the classical limit , if it exists , is for large times unity we study the quantity @xmath40 , where from now we will acknowledge implicitly the dependence of the correlation on the particular choice of partitions .",
    "1 shows an example of the generic behaviour of @xmath41 , this particular data being for the standard map at two different values of the inverse planck constant @xmath15 for the same classical value of the chaos parameter .",
    "the initial relaxing behaviour is not clear from the figures as the time scales are much larger than the inverse of the principal ruelle resonance .",
    "the projection operators used are diagonal in the discrete position basis , @xmath16 is given by eq .",
    "( [ proj - op ] ) and @xmath42 .",
    "the position eigenbasis is denoted as @xmath23 and in this figure @xmath43 .",
    "we note that in this paper we have used dimensionless scaled position and momentum co - ordinates and that the time is measured as multiples of the period of the kick , taken as unity .",
    "modulo one conditions restrict the phase space to the unit torus so that the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath15 is related to the planck constant as @xmath44 and the classical limit corresponds to @xmath45 while the parameters of the map such as the kick strengths are scaled and dimensionless .",
    "the first observation is that the quantum correlation is in fact quite close to the classical value of unity , second is that the average of the oscillations in relation to unity will give us some information about whether quantum mechanics is inhibiting transport or otherwise , thirdly this average must in the classical limit tend to unity , fourth is the observation that the fluctuations are getting smaller in the classical limit and must tend to zero . some of these observations have been made and substantiated earlier @xcite , here we will elaborate and present more results .    previous work on the use of time developing states to study the quantum manifestations of chaos have basically concentrated on the survival probability of a pure state @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath46 with an arbitrary normalized initial state @xmath47 and thus @xmath48 .",
    "such survival probabilities averaged over random initial states show a distinct difference between chaotic and regular systems .",
    "in contrast what we study in this paper are density ( or projection ) operators and not pure states .",
    "it becomes quite important that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are large and are of the order of the hilbert space dimensionality @xmath15 itself .",
    "besides any `` arbitrary '' state can be chosen for the calculation of the survival probability while we will restrict ourselves to those projection operators that can be interpreted as phase space regions in the classical limit .",
    "this is to ensure that the classical transition to chaos is fully reflected in the quantum relaxation , as will be illustrated below .",
    "the quantum `` equilibrium '' as opposed to the classical is an highly oscillatory state , with the fluctuations coming from the discrete nature of the spectrum .",
    "we will denote the time average of the correlation function by @xmath51 and its variance by @xmath52 .",
    "these quantities can be written in terms of the eigenfunctions of the evolution operator @xmath35 , which satisfy the following equation .",
    "@xmath53 the real numbers @xmath54 are the eigenangles of the quantum map , and we are assuming that there are no exact degenerecies as is the generic case .",
    "the correlation is then @xmath55 thus we can express the average quite simply as latexmath:[\\[<c>=\\frac{1}{n f_{a}(1-f_{a } ) } \\sum_{m=0}^{n-1 } \\sum_{n=0}^{f_{a}n-1 } \\sum_{n^{\\prime}= f_{a}n}^{n-1 } |\\langle n|\\psi_{m } \\rangle |^{2 }     thus the average is a measure of the distribution of the eigenvectors in the subspaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest that @xmath57 generically , indicating a certain reluctance to participate equally in both the partitions in proportion to their sizes .",
    "time dependent quantum chaotic systems such as the kicked rotor on the cylinder are known to suppress classical chaos and lower diffusion @xcite .",
    "the corresponding suppression in the case of bounded systems is in the average relaxation such as measured by @xmath51 .",
    "we note that the sum over @xmath58 and @xmath59 expressing the average can be factored into two single sums , and we see that if for instance we had a parity symmetry forcing the wavefunction to be essentially identical in the subspaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 we would have @xmath60 , which is indeed the case for the fluctuations shown in fig .",
    "1 . the average @xmath51 could also be greater than unity in the presence of symmetries , or if the partition @xmath2 is identical to @xmath1 .",
    "although in the absence of any special symmetry it is true that classical chaos will tend to enhance the average making it closer to unity , this effect is quite marginal and practically non - existent when a transition to complete classical chaos is achieved .",
    "2a shows the average for the quantized baker map implementing the bernoulli scheme @xmath61 as a function of the inverse planck constant @xmath15 .",
    "the partitions are such that @xmath43 . shown is the deviation of the average from unity and an approximate power law",
    "is observed for large @xmath15 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath62 and in this case @xmath63 . the relaxation localization is implied by @xmath64 being positive .",
    "2b shows the same quantity for the standard map and we find for the partition @xmath65 that @xmath66 , with a different value of @xmath64 .",
    "we note that in both the cases there is a small oscillation about the fitted straight line .",
    "3a shows the variation of the average with the classical kick parameter @xmath67 for the standard map , the map undergoing a transition to complete chaos with the breaking of the last kam torus at @xmath68 .",
    "the partition @xmath1 was such that @xmath69 and @xmath2 was the complimentary space .",
    "also illustrated is the localization effect and the same for the kicked harper model in fig .",
    "3b . the kicked harper map , or simply the harper map , undergoes a transition to chaos at the kick strength @xmath70 ( see appendix ) .",
    "a promising candidate is the variance of the fluctuations which exist irrespective of the symmetries of the system .",
    "this can also be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions of the system . in the particular case",
    "when @xmath18 , writing for @xmath27 simply @xmath71 , we get after some simplifications @xmath72 thus the variance measures a correlation between distinct pairs of eigenfunctions .",
    "there is a coherent partial sum over @xmath73 states that makes the variance non - trivial and perhaps non - universal .",
    "4a shows the standard deviation @xmath74 scaled to @xmath75 as a function of the kick strength in the case of the standard map .",
    "the transition to classical chaos at @xmath68 is visible in the variance of the fluctuations as a point at which it attains an approximately constant value .",
    "the relaxation fluctuations are therefore significantly different depending on the dynamical nature of the classical limit , being in general larger for regular systems than chaotic ones , and thus provide a novel diagnostic devise for the study of quantized chaotic systems .",
    "4b shows identical quantities for the case of the kicked harper map .",
    "the variance seems to have no further dependence on measures of chaos and scales as @xmath30 quite universally when the classical limit is chaotic .",
    "this scaling is shown explicitly in fig . 5 for three systems in the chaotic regime : the kicked rotor , the kicked harper map and the usual quantum bakers map .",
    "the fact that the three lines , of slope close to @xmath76 , are practically on top of each other is evidence of a limited universality of the relaxation fluctuations .",
    "the limits to universality will be discussed in the following , but also shown in the figure are the results for a generalized bakers map implementing the @xmath61 bernoulli scheme which clearly shares the same slope but is different otherwise from the other cases which are symmetric .    when the classical limit is regular there is still evidence for scaling with @xmath30 but with non - universal exponents .",
    "6 suggests that for the standard map , @xmath77 with the exponent @xmath78 increasing to unity as the kick strength is increased to induce the transition to chaos . when @xmath79 or @xmath80 the exponent is already close to unity and the two cases are practically indistinguishable",
    "when @xmath81 the relaxation is between non - symmetrically related partitions of unequal measures .",
    "the quantum variance is studied directly as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "still we are considering the case when the two partitions complement each other .",
    "results not shown here indicate that the dependence of the standard deviation on @xmath15 ( or @xmath30 ) remains the same , namely @xmath82 .",
    "thus we may conjecture the existence of a function @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "the function @xmath83 will naturally depend on the choice of the density operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 . if further we choose these operators as the projection operators described by the eq .",
    "( [ proj - op ] ) , we numerically find the relation @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the constant has been identified as related to the number @xmath87 by averaging over different @xmath67 in the chaotic regime . beyond @xmath88 symmetry of the maps",
    "ensures that @xmath89 .",
    "it is to be emphasized that although @xmath74 is independent of model parameters like @xmath67 , we are assuming that there has been a completed transition to full scale chaos .",
    "7 compares @xmath90 with the fit @xmath91 for the standard map , the harper map and the bakers map .",
    "the standard map and the harper fall practically on top of each other while the bakers map shown deviations although the trend is maintained .",
    "the insensitivity of this curve to the parameter @xmath67 or @xmath92 indicates that once chaos is achieved the fluctuations are essentially the same .",
    "the curve @xmath93 as a function of @xmath71 is thus interesting in that it has restricted universal features .",
    "the harper and the standard maps behave almost identically while there are deviations for the baker ; moreover the curve is most definitely dependent on the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but once this is fixed the fluctuations might be model independent .",
    "though the fluctuations are not universal they do distinguish classically regular and chaotic motions when the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 have meaningful classical limits .",
    "if this condition is violated then the fluctuations are incapable of such a separation .",
    "this is in contrast to rmt based arguments for the randomness of a wavefunction , where so much information is lost that in any generic basis the wavefunctions of a classically chaotic system are universally distributed .",
    "we will illustrate this in two ways . in the first we choose",
    "@xmath94 for constructing @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the complementary space .",
    "8 shows that the variance does not capture the transition to chaos at around @xmath95 for the kicked rotor , unlike in the cases above , one of which has been repeated for comparison purposes .",
    "however once the transition to chaos is complete the three standard deviations seem to coincide .",
    "we have diagonalized a standard map at @xmath96 to ensure that there are no special correlations with the system at around @xmath97 .",
    "finally we construct the operators out of coherent states so that the interpretation as subspaces of phase space is intuitively obvious in the classical limit .",
    "we use the discrete toral coherent states developed by saraceno @xcite .",
    "let @xmath98 be such a state that is localized at @xmath99 on the unit torus .",
    "we take @xmath100 and @xmath17 is similarly constructed . in the computation shown below",
    "we have taken @xmath1 to be the subspace @xmath101 and @xmath2 to be @xmath102 .",
    "the variance is evaluated as above with some minor differences , since @xmath103 .",
    "the measures of the quantum subspaces are @xmath104 , as we have used normalized coherent states .",
    "the eigenfunctions are expressed in the coherent state basis and the variance is evaluated . fig .",
    "9 shows the results of this computation and once more we recover the property that the variance captures the classical transition to chaos .",
    "not presented are some more results , in particular the computations using the momentum basis vectors , as these simply reflect the general trends already noted above .",
    "we have been studying the mean and standard deviation of a quantity that is truly a quasi - periodic oscillation ; the distribution of such a quantity ought to be significantly different from a random process .",
    "however fig .",
    "10 motivates that the effect of quantum chaos is to cast the oscillations into the ubiquitous gaussian process , and increasingly more so in the classical limit , thereby indicating that the mean and standard deviation are sufficient to characterize the relaxation process .",
    "the solid line is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation equal to @xmath105 , as the partitions used correspond to @xmath43 . in sharp contrast fig .",
    "11 shows the same for the case of the standard map at @xmath106 when the dynamics is predominantly regular .",
    "the distribution is much broader and is also non - symmetric .",
    "thus if the parameter @xmath67 is considered as a pseudo time variable , the onset of chaos is signaled as the realization of a stationary state of the relaxation fluctuations - the gaussian distribution .",
    "we have studied the quasi - periodic relaxation in bound quantum systems whose classical counterparts relax to a coarse grained equilibrium .",
    "we have concentrated on the correlations between density operators whose classical limits ( or more correctly the limit of their wigner - weyl representations ) may be interpreted as piecewise continuous functions on phase space . we have observed that in the absence of special symmetries the average quantum relaxation is smaller than the classical , and we have presented some scaling relations with @xmath30 .",
    "the relaxation fluctuations have been shown to provide rather interesting characterization of the quantum motion .",
    "they sometimes have universal characteristics although these are limited .",
    "the kicked map and the harper model with identical symmetry properties have been shown to be practically identical in the behaviour of their relaxation fluctuations .",
    "the standard deviation of these fluctuations have been studied and has been shown to decrease to a constant value with a rather sharp change in the values corresponding to the transition to chaos in the classical system . thus the fluctuations provide a new way to characterize quantum chaos .",
    "the standard deviation has been shown to scale as @xmath30 when there is classical chaos universally , while it has other non - universal power law dependencies when the classical motion is not chaotic .",
    "random matrix theories have been providing a framework to study several properties of quantized chaotic systems and it is natural to explore the random matrix predictions for the quantities studied in this note .",
    "it is of special interest to place the numerical results in this paper in the context of a generalization of the previous work on survival probabilties @xcite and work on these aspects are currently underway .",
