    "it is of great cosmological importance to identify the volume of space , centered on the local group , which is at rest with respect to the cmb .",
    "very large scale fluctuations are required to move ever larger volumes of space in the standard gravitational instability model . in standard cold dark matter cosmologies ,",
    "the volume of space bounded by the nearest superclusters ( great attractor , pisces - perseus , coma ) is expected to define an inertial frame nearly at rest with respect to the cmb .",
    "the distribution of the matter within this volume should explain the @xmath1  motion of the local group in the cmb frame .",
    "the detection of a large amplitude ( @xmath5 ) on scales exceeding 8000  by lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , followed by recent measurements with similar amplitude by willick ( these proceedings ) and the smac team ( smith , these proceedings ) , have not only challenged the notion that the bulk flow on large scales is small , but have also pushed cosmological models to the breaking point .",
    "moreover , there are contradictory claims for the observed bulk flow within a sphere of 6000 , and whether it is generated by internal or external mass fluctuations . the most recent potent reconstruction of the markiii velocities ( dekel  1999 ) found a bulk velocity within 6000  of @xmath6 in the cmb frame towards supergalactic @xmath7 .",
    "dekel  ( 1999 ) argue that this motion is generated by the _",
    "external _ mass distribution on very large scales ( see also courteau  1993 ) . however , other investigations using nearly homogeneous samples of galaxies within and beyond @xmath2 find motion consistent with the amplitude and direction of the cmb dipole ( giovanelli , these proceedings ) .",
    "new local peculiar velocity measurements based on the brightness of supernovae type ia ( riess , these proceedings ) and surface brightness fluctuations ( tonry and dressler , these proceedings ) are also consistent with little bulk motion at @xmath8 .",
    "this suggests that the reflex motion of the local group could be explained by material contained _ within _ @xmath8 .",
    "the controversy over the observed bulk flow within @xmath8 stems , in large part , from our inability to combine the various galaxy distance samples used in flow studies into a single homogeneous catalog .",
    "none of the surveys within @xmath8 had sampled the _ entire _",
    "sky uniformly . in an effort to overcome this situation",
    ", we devised a new study that would take advantage of northern and southern noao facilities to map the motions of a shell of galaxies with significant overlap between the hemispheres , and with existing peculiar velocity surveys .",
    "_ shellflow  _ survey was designed to provide _ precise _ and _ uniform _ photometric and spectroscopic data over the whole sky , and thus to remove the uncertainties associated with matching heterogeneous data sets .",
    "with shellflow , and further calibration of existing tf data sets , we expect a high - accuracy detection of the bulk flow amplitude and a better constrained characterization of the tidal field at 6000 .",
    "the shellflow sample is drawn from the optical redshift survey sample of santiago  ( 1995 ; ors ) .",
    "the ors sample consists of all galaxies in the ugc , eso , and esgc catalogs with @xmath9 and @xmath10 we initially selected all non - interacting sb and sc galaxies in the ors with redshifts ; if we chose only one of them , the sample would decrease in size by 20% . ] between 4000 and 7500 , inclinations between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and with burstein - heiles ( 1982 ) extinctions @xmath13 030 .",
    "this produced a catalog of more than 300 objects .",
    "all galaxies were then visually inspected on the digitized poss plates ; those with bright foreground stars and obvious disturbances were excluded , yielding a final sample of 297 shellflow galaxies .",
    "no pruning was done of galaxies not matching idealized morphologies beyond the restriction on hubble type and inclination .",
    "the data were collected between march 1996 and march 1998 at noao , using v and i - band photometry and  rotation curves .",
    "data taking and reduction techniques follow the basic guidelines of previous optical tf surveys (  courteau 1996 , 1997 ; schlegel 1995 ) .",
    "the v and i - band imaging was obtained at the ctio and kpno 0.9 m telescopes .",
    "the photometric calibration is based on the kron - cousins system ; data taken on nights with standard star photometric scatter greater than 0020 were excluded .",
    "the kron - cousins system also allows direct matching with two largest i - band tf samples to date ( mathewson  1992 , giovanelli  1998 ) .",
    "the  spectroscopy was obtained mostly in photometric conditions with the rc spectrographs at the ctio and kpno 4 m telescopes .",
    "typical integrations were @xmath14s and @xmath15s for imaging and spectroscopy respectively .",
    "forty - one galaxies were imaged at both ctio and kpno , and we have repeat imaging from a given telescope for 106 galaxies .",
    "in addition , we observed 27 galaxies spectroscopically from both ctio and kpno , and obtained duplicate spectra from a given telescope for 38 galaxies .",
    "the total magnitudes and rotational line widths reproduce to within 006 and 3  ( rms deviations ) respectively , with no systematic effects seen between hemispheres or between runs .",
    "moreover , all data reduction was done independently by courteau and willick using different software and methodology ; the results between the two agree to within the errors quoted above .",
    "the high level of accuracy in our shellflow data meets our requirement for a measurement of a significant bulk flow result .",
    "following the approach of lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , we use the sample itself to calibrate the distance indicator relation ; this mitigates the need to tie the sample to external tf calibrators such as clusters ( although it precludes measurement of a monopole term in the velocity field ) .",
    "we choose the `` inverse '' form of the tf relation , which makes malmquist and selection bias effects negligible ( cf . ,",
    "strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis for a pure hubble expansion model ( no bulk flow ) allows us to constrain @xmath16 , the intrinsic tf scatter , and @xmath17 , the typical error in measuring raw rotation velocities .",
    "we hardwire @xmath18 , the total error associated with photometry ( including inclination errors ) , to 0.15 mag , which is a small fraction of the error budget .",
    "two other parameters constrain the dependence of the tf relation on surface brightness and shape of the rotation curve .",
    "the best tf fit is achieved for @xmath19 measured near 1.7 disk scale lengths , similar to but somewhat smaller than the values found by courteau ( 1997 ) and willick ( 1999 ) .",
    "a small surface brightness dependence is also found for the optimized tf relation , although this could be induced by the particular choice of luminosity profile fitting that we have adopted ( see also the discussion by willick [ lp10k ] , these proceedings ; courteau  2000 ) .    for this analysis",
    ", we adopt a model of * hubble expansion plus a bulk flow * to compute absolute from apparent magnitudes :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the measured redshift in .",
    "we measure @xmath22 in either the * cmb * frame or the * lg * frame .",
    "( a different choice of hubble constant would shift the zero point of the derived tf relation but would have no effect on our bulk flow fits . )",
    "the tf fit slope and scatter are comparable to recent i - band investigations (  giovanelli  1998 ) . the shellflow tf relation is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we find no dependence of the internal extinction correction on luminosity , and the tf parameters are virtually unchanged whether one adopts burstein - heiles ( bh ) , or schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ( sfd ) galactic extinctions .",
    "the optimization with respect to all tf parameters and bulk flow velocity components ( v@xmath23,v@xmath24,v@xmath25 ) , yields the following fits :    rrr|l + v@xmath25   & v@xmath23   & v@xmath24   & frame + @xmath26&@xmath27&@xmath28&cmb + @xmath29&@xmath30&@xmath31&lg +    rrr|l + v@xmath25   & v@xmath23  & v@xmath24   & frame + @xmath32&@xmath33&@xmath34&cmb + @xmath35&@xmath36&@xmath37&lg +    the typical velocity errors , computed by holding the other parameters fixed , are @xmath38v@xmath39 , @xmath38v@xmath40 , @xmath38v@xmath41 , for an upper limit on the total amplitude equal to @xmath38v @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "numerical simulations to assess the full covariance matrix of the errors will be presented elsewhere .",
    "modelling the shellflow galaxy peculiar velocities with a hubble expansion and a bulk flow , one finds a low bulk motion of @xmath44  with respect to the cmb .",
    "correspondingly , the shellflow volume moves at @xmath1  in the frame of the lg .",
    "this corresponds to the reflex motion of the local group motion with respect to the cmb .",
    "the directional components of the flow are poorly constrained since its amplitude is so low .",
    "our result is in agreement with other newly - presented results at this workshop , derived from surface brightness fluctuation techniques ( tonry & dressler ; v@xmath45  at 3000 ) , nearby snia ( @xmath46 consistent with zero at 6000 ( riess , these proceedings ) , and previous tf analyses by giovanelli and collaborators . taken together these results suggest that most of the mass responsible for the motion of the lg lies within 6000 .",
    "thanks to many new peculiar velocity surveys , the picture of cosmological bulk flows seems to imply `` convergence '' of the flow field within 6000  to the cmb dipole value .",
    "however , this simple picture is challenged by a mix of low and high amplitude bulk flow measurements on larger scales .",
    "if the flow is nearly quiet at @xmath47 , one is hard - pressed to explain the reported high amplitude flows on larger scales .",
    "these issues are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "two of us ( jw & sc @xmath48 collaborators ) have recently combined the major distance - redshift surveys from both hemispheres ( published before 1994 ) into a catalog of 3100 galaxies ( willick  1997 , the `` markiii catalog '' ) .",
    "however , full homogenization at the @xmath49% level , the minimum required for an accurate bulk flow detection at 6000 , was not achieved in markiii due to irreducible uncertainties associated with matching disparate tf datasets .",
    "furthermore , a revised calibration of the markiii tf zero - points based on maximal agreement with the peculiar velocities predicted by the iras 1.2jy redshift survey suggests a possible source of systematic error for the data sets which cover the pp cone ( davis , nusser , & willick 1996 , willick & strauss 1998 [ velmod ] ) . this uncertainty has not seriously affected mass density reconstructions ( dekel  1999 ) but it could lead to spurious estimates of the bulk flows on larger scales .",
    "markiii was originally tied to the north / south cluster calibration of han & mould ( 1992 ) .",
    "we now plan a revised markiv calibration based on shellflow . because of the overlap with existing surveys at comparable depth",
    ", shellflow will be of fundamental importance in tying these datasets together in a uniform way . with this more accurate global calibration",
    ", we expect that the markiv catalog will be better suited than its predecessors for studying the velocity and density fields in the local universe .",
    "* the shellflow velocity components in the cmb frame are small .",
    "_ there is no significant bulk motion of the shellflow sample relative to the cmb . _ * the shellflow velocity components are large when the fit is done in the lg frame .",
    "this represents the reflex of the lg motion with respect to the cmb .",
    "* results are insensitive to bh versus sfd galactic extinctions . *",
    "the shellflow bulk motion reported here has not been fully tested against monte - carlo simulations or using a complete tidal field analysis .",
    "a comprehensive study is under way .",
    "we wish to thank various students and postdocs who have contributed to some of the shellflow reductions . in victoria , shelly pinder and yong - john sohn , and josh simon , felicia tam , and marcos lopez - caniego at stanford .",
