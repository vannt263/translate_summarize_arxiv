    "among the observed in narrow - bands materials metal - insulator transitions  ( mit ) the significant interest is attracted to the transitions from paramagnetic metal state to paramagnetic insulator state at increase of temperature which exhibit the systems nis@xmath0se@xmath1",
    "@xcite-@xcite , ( v@xmath2cr@xmath1)@xmath3o@xmath4  @xcite and y@xmath2ca@xmath1tio@xmath4  @xcite ; in these systems the paramagnetic insulator - paramagnetic metal transitions under external pressure are observed also .",
    "there are reasons to believe that noted transitions are the consequences of electron - electron interactions and can be described within the framework of hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "hubbard model is the simplest model describing mit in materials with narrow energy bands .",
    "this model describes a single non - degenerate band of electrons with the local coulomb interaction . the model hamiltonian contains two energy parameters : the hopping integral of an electron from one site to another and the intraatomic coulomb repulsion of two electrons of the opposite spins .",
    "this model is used intensively ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) in order to describe the peculiarities of physical properties of narrow - band materials ; in this connection two - pole approaches are attractive .",
    "the two - pole approaches in the hubbard model and the hubbard bands conception ( being the consequence of two - pole approximation ) have been useful for understanding of the peculiarities of electric and magnetic properties of narrow - band materials  @xcite .",
    "however within the framework of two - pole approaches there are series of issues , in particular the problem of metal - insulator transition description  @xcite-@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "recently proposed two - pole approximation  @xcite is used to study effects of electron correlations in the hubbard model .",
    "the single particle green function and energy spectrum are obtained . in the ground state",
    "analitical dependences of energy gap , polar states ( doublons or holes ) concentration and energy of the system on model parameters are found .",
    "dependences for energy gap , polar states concentration on temperature are calculated .",
    "the obtained results are compared with corresponding results of other approximations and are used for the interpretation of some experimental data . in particular , the observable transitions from an insulating state to a metallic one at increase of bandwidth , and from a metallic state to an insulating one at increasing temperature are explained .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian  [ 1 ] in terms of transition - operators of @xmath5-site from state @xmath6 to state @xmath7 @xmath8  @xcite is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the chemical potential , @xmath11 is the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion , @xmath12 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral , @xmath13 is the operator of number of @xmath7-states on @xmath5-site ; @xmath14 denotes spin of an electron ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 denotes the projection of electron spin opposite to @xmath14 ; @xmath17 describes system in the atomic limit , @xmath18 describes electron hoppings between single occupied sites and empty sites ( holes ) ( the first sum in @xmath19  processes forming `` h - band '' ) and electron hoppings between doubly occupied sites ( doublons ) and single occupied sites ( the second sum in @xmath19  processes forming `` d - band '' ) .",

    "3 the dependences of polar states concentration on parameter @xmath71 at different temperatures are presented .",
    "note the important difference ( see fig.4 ) of the dependence of @xmath72 on temperature from result of papers  @xcite : we found that at any temperature polar states concentration increases monotonically with increasing temperature at the fixed value of @xmath71 when respective dependence in  @xcite has a minimum .",
    "the dependence of @xmath73 on parameter @xmath71 at zero temperature is plotted in fig .",
    "5 . it is important to note that in the point of gap disappearence @xmath74 in contrast to the previously obtained result  @xcite . at increasing @xmath71 the energy gap width increases ( the negative values of @xmath61 correspond to the overlapping of the subbands ) . for comparison on fig.5 results of approximation `` hubbard - i ''",
