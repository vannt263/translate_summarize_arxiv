    "the achilles heel of supersymmetry lies , arguably , in the difficulty of satisfying naturalness while simultaneously decoupling supersymmetric effects from low - energy experimental observables .",
    "naturalness is typically taken to require supersymmetric particle masses below @xmath1 , a few times the weak scale .",
    "in contrast , without an understanding of small scalar mass splittings , mixing angles , and @xmath0-violating phases , a variety of experimental measurements suggest that supersymmetric scalar masses must lie well above a tev .",
    "the experimental constraints have varying degrees of significance and model dependence .",
    "examples include the following :    * the kaon system .",
    "constraints from the @xmath2 system depend on the flavor and chirality structure of the scalar quarks .",
    "roughly speaking , however , for moderate degeneracies , the constraint from @xmath3 is most severe ; it requires squark masses of order 100 tev .",

    "the electric dipole moments of the neutron and electron typically require multi - tev squark and slepton masses if the relevant phases are not suppressed  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . * the proton lifetime .",
    "lower bounds on the proton lifetime place strong constraints on supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) , especially for large @xmath5  @xcite .",

    "the polonyi problem .",
    "many supersymmetric theories contain late decaying scalar fields that ruin the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "this problem is independent of scalar degeneracies or phases , but may be solved if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is of order 10 tev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , many models predict scalar masses hierarchically larger than gaugino masses  @xcite .",
    "given the current bounds on gaugino masses , scalar masses must then be well above a tev .",
    "the conflict between naturalness and experimental constraints may be resolved by observing that , roughly speaking , naturalness restricts the masses of scalars with large yukawa couplings , while experiment constrains the masses of scalars with small yukawas  @xcite .",
    "naturalness affects particles that are strongly coupled to the higgs sector , while experimental constraints are strongest in sectors with light fermions that are plentifully produced .",
    "this suggests that naturalness and experimental constraints may be simultaneously satisfied by an `` inverted hierarchy '' approach , in which light fermions have heavy superpartners , and vice versa .",
    "in particular , third generation scalars with masses @xmath6 satisfy naturalness constraints , while first and second generation scalars at some much higher scale @xmath7 avoid many experimental difficulties .",
    "a number of possibilities have been proposed to dynamically generate scalar masses at two hierarchically separated scales  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate a new mechanism for generating an inverted hierarchy .",
    "we will assume that all scalar masses are of order @xmath7 when produced at some scale , say the gut or planck scale .",
    "we will then use renormalization group evolution to create an inverted hierarchy at the weak scale .",
    "this mechanism works because the renormalization group equations automatically suppress the masses of scalars associated with fermions which have large yukawa couplings .",

    "this mechanism was investigated recently in models with large top and bottom yukawa couplings ( and all others small )  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for particular high scale boundary conditions , all scalars with large yukawas may be driven asymptotically to @xmath8 in the infrared .",
    "stops , sbottoms , and higgs scalars are then naturally light at the weak scale , while the masses of all other scalars remain heavy . in this way a very large hierarchy can be created dynamically .    in what follows",
    "we will consider the well - motivated supersymmetric guts , with special emphasis on so(10 ) unified theories .",
    "as is well - known , such theories , among other merits , successfully predict gauge coupling unification and naturally accommodate massive neutrinos . in the present context , however , they have even more virtues .",
    "first , they naturally provide the universal and large third generation yukawa couplings required to implement the inverted hierarchy .",
    "second , as we will see , the existence of a right - handed neutrino plays an important part in creating a plausible fixed point structure .",
    "these virtues make grand unified theories the natural setting for the radiatively generated inverted hierarchy mechanism .",

    "it is clear that the scalar masses , including @xmath16 and @xmath11 , are of order @xmath7 at all scales , and the theory must be fine - tuned .",

    "the final masses are greatly suppressed relative to their initial values .",

    "the right - handed neutrino plays a critical role in leading us to a plausibly simple boundary condition .    in reaching the above conclusions , we have made a number of approximations that must be examined .",
    "first , we have neglected the fact that the yukawa couplings evolve independently , and , in particular , the fact that the leptonic and hadronic yukawas differ significantly at lower energy scales .",

    "this is the region in which the gauge interactions , and hence , the yukawa couplings , remain roughly universal . below this scale ,",
    "the yukawa couplings split substantially , but by then , the hierarchy is already created and can not be destroyed .",
    "the assumption of universal yukawa couplings throughout the evolution interval is therefore a convenient fiction .    in our analysis , we have neglected effects of order @xmath8 , which clearly have little impact on the overall suppression of the scalar mass scale .",
    "they do , however , modify the rges at the weak scale when the scalar masses are of order @xmath8 . by omitting such effects",
    ", we forfeit the possibility of investigating a number of topics , including the details of electroweak symmetry breaking , as well as quantitative determinations of finite corrections to fermion masses and the residual fine - tuning required to keep the @xmath75 mass light .",
    "here , we note only that our scenario shares the problem of proper electroweak symmetry breaking generic to all supersymmetric scenarios with large @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "several possible solutions have been discussed in the literature .",
    "for example , if the gut group is broken not in one step , but in a chain beginning with @xmath76 , the resulting u(1 ) @xmath42-terms may help induce proper electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . these terms are parametrically of order @xmath77 , but are suppressed by the large @xmath78 charge of the singlet .",

    "( this definition of @xmath82 is invariant under possible shifts from @xmath42-terms . )",
    "we then define the suppression , or crunching , factor @xmath83 where the weak scale @xmath84 is taken to be 1 tev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssms ] we plot @xmath85 in the @xmath86 plane . for a broad range of @xmath87 near its quasi - fixed point",

    ", the scalar masses do not approach their fixed point as quickly , and for larger values , two - loop effects become important .",
    "indeed , the two - loop terms give positive contributions to @xmath89 , and therefore increase the yukawa suppression of scalar masses .",
    "however , they also give positive contributions directly to these masses .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ mssmrge ] ) . )",
    "the latter effects dominate , so the two - loop terms degrade the hierarchy . for @xmath87 larger than shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mssms ] , the two - loop effects become so large that perturbation theory can not be trusted .    the definition of @xmath85 is , of course , somewhat arbitrary , but its size gives an indication of the reductions in the scalar masses that are possible from radiative effects .",
    "in particular , @xmath85 provides a rough measure of the reduction of the scalar contribution to fine - tuning and @xmath90 is a measure of @xmath91 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : mssms ] we see that , if values of @xmath8 of order 1 tev are considered natural , values of @xmath7 up to @xmath92 are acceptable .",
    "this is then the scale of the matter fields of the first and second generation , which , given their small yukawa couplings , do not renormalize significantly .",
    "a scale of 4 tev does not completely solve the most stringent flavor and @xmath0 problems related to the @xmath2 system , but it does reduce them significantly with respect to the typical case with squark masses of 1 tev .",
    "in addition , several of the other experimental difficulties mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] are also resolved .",
    "detecting scalars with such heavy masses will pose a serious challenge to future colliders .",
    "finally , we note that the values of @xmath85 are largely independent of @xmath70 . for @xmath93 , the hierarchy",
    "is already created by the time the neutrino decouples , and so is insensitive to the decoupling scale . however , even for @xmath70 approaching @xmath47 , a large hierarchy is possible .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "when @xmath38 decouples , the new evolution matrix @xmath94 is the upper @xmath95 block of @xmath32 with @xmath96 .",
    "the matrix @xmath94 has 3 positive and 4 zero eigenvalues . in terms of @xmath97 ,",
    "the 2 largest eigenvalues are @xmath98 ; their corresponding eigenvectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 are also quickly damped .",
    "if we decompose the 7-dimensional truncation of @xmath52 into these new eigenvectors , @xmath101 , we find that the decomposition is dominated by @xmath99 and @xmath100 components : for the remaining components , @xmath102 . thus , the decoupling of @xmath38 perturbs the fixed point structure only slightly  when @xmath38 decouples , the scalar mass spectrum projects mainly on to the new eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues , and the rapid exponential damping continues .",
    "note that the special case @xmath103 is equivalent to the case of an su(5 ) gut with universal yukawa couplings and minimal su(5 ) particle content .",
    "the exact eigenvectors for the su(5 ) fixed point system are complicated .",
    "however , the above analysis shows that @xmath104 is nearly a linear combination of eigenvectors with large eigenvalues , so large hierarchies can be generated from simple boundary conditions in the su(5 ) case as well .",
    "an inverse hierarchy may also be generated in supergravity theories through renormalization group evolution above the unification scale . in this section",
    "we consider models in which scalar masses are generated at the supergravity scale , which we take to be the reduced planck scale @xmath105 , and then evolved to the gut scale @xmath106 .",
    "even though the evolution interval is only two decades , we again find that substantial hierarchies may be created for simple initial scalar spectra .",
    "we will consider two generic cases for illustration .",
    "we begin by considering so(10 ) models , that is , the class of models with superpotential @xmath107 where the matter fields are contained in @xmath108 ( @xmath58 ) and both up - type and down - type higgs fields are contained in a single multiplet : @xmath109 ( @xmath59 ) @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 are @xmath113 and @xmath114 representations of the su(5 ) subgroup , respectively .",
    "we allow arbitrary additional field content , subject only to the constraint that additional superpotential couplings are small relative to @xmath87 .",

    "the rges for this class of models are given in the appendix .",
    "note that additional interactions and an extended higgs sector are required to break so(10 ) and generate flavor structure .",
    "in general , this leads to a set of rges that are highly model - dependent .",
    "fortunately , though , in the limit we consider , the rges simplify considerably .",
    "first , we assume that all additional yukawa couplings are small , so their impact on the rges may be neglected .",
    "second , the presence of additional fields with standard model quantum numbers modifies all rge terms with two or more powers of @xmath117 .",
    "fortunately , as argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : mssm ] , the two - loop terms of this form are highly suppressed .",
    "( we have checked that they are insignificant for reasonable field content . )",
    "third , extra fields with standard model quantum numbers also change the one - loop @xmath64-function coefficient @xmath118 . to good approximation ,",

    "nevertheless , even for initial yukawa couplings @xmath127 , we see that @xmath128 is possible .",
    "scalars at 2 tev again ameliorate a number of problems , and also stretch the discovery limits of planned future colliders .      finally , we consider the minimal su(5 ) model and extensions .",

    "this inverse hierarchy mechanism offers an appealing and natural way to satisfy the strong experimental constraints on first and second generation scalars in supersymmetric theories .    the third generation scalar masses are determined by infrared fixed points , so their precise values are insensitive to the initial conditions at , say , @xmath47 ( or to the exact value of @xmath47 , for that matter ) .",

    "note that this is opposite to the typical situation is unified models , where @xmath145 generational splitting from unification - era evolution @xcite can lead to new contributions to flavor @xcite and @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "( a similar situation occurs in the presence of a right - handed neutrino with a large yukawa coupling @xcite . )    throughout this analysis , we have neglected off - diagonal scalar squared masses . for the squark masses , constraints on @xmath149 have already been noted above .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath150 and @xmath151 are also constrained : the requirement that the squark mass matrix be tachyon - free implies @xmath152 .",
    "the off - diagonal masses are not driven to @xmath8 and are , in fact , essentially rge - invariant ; the origins of their slight suppressions must therefore lie elsewhere . depending on the extent of these suppressions , some interesting signals , for example",
    ", in the @xmath153 system , may be observable in the near future  @xcite .",
    "finally , we draw some implications for high energy colliders . in these scenarios , as in all scenarios with inverted scalar hierarchies , scalars with mass @xmath7 are beyond the reach of proposed colliders , such as the lhc and nlc , and can only be detected through their non - decoupling from super - oblique corrections  @xcite .",
    "a goal of supersymmetric collider studies is to precisely measure superparticle properties , and thereby determine the supersymmetric parameters at the weak scale .",
    "it is then hoped that hints about physics at even smaller distances can be found by evolving these parameters to very high energies .",
    "the fixed point analysis shows that in certain directions of parameter space , corresponding to eigenvectors of the scalar mass evolution matrix with large eigenvalues , even large masses at the high scale are exponentially suppressed when they are evolved to the weak scale .",
