    "a common approach to get some insight regarding the mechanism of confinement is to approximate the yang - mills path integral by restricting the integration to certain subsets of gauge field configurations . by considering such effective theories one might find out , which gauge field configurations are responsible for confinement and which are not .",
    "examples are ensembles of singular gauge instantons ( c.f .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , ensembles of calorons ( c.f .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , ensembles of regular gauge instantons and ensembles of merons @xcite or the removal of center vortices in lattice calculations ( c.f .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some of these approaches have analytical aspects but most of them extensively resort to numerical methods .    in this work",
    "we generalize the ideas and techniques presented in @xcite .",
    "we study different classes of gauge field configurations , especially their importance with regard to confinement , by applying a numerical method called pseudoparticle approach @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that with a suitable choice of building blocks many essential features of su(2 ) yang - mills theory can be reproduced , particularly confinement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_001 ]",
    "we explain the basic principle of the pseudoparticle approach .",
    "we also discuss numerical issues and compare the method to lattice gauge theory . in section  [ sec_003 ] we show how to calculate certain observables in the pseudoparticle approach : the static quark antiquark potential at zero and at finite temperature , the topological susceptibility and the critical temperature of the confinement deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we present numerical results , which are in qualitative agreement with lattice results . in section  [ sec_007 ]",
    "we apply the pseudoparticle approach with different types of building blocks , to study different classes of gauge field configurations and their effect on confinement . by doing that we try to determine properties of confining gauge field configurations .",
    "our findings indicate that topological charge as well as extended structures are necessary to obtain confinement . in section  [ sec_011 ]",
    "we summarize our results and give a brief outlook regarding future research .",
    "in this work we consider euclidean su(2 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "the action is given by @xmath0 with action density @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the dimensionless coupling constant ) and field strength @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the topological charge is defined by @xmath5 with topological charge density @xmath6 and dual field strength @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the basic idea of the pseudoparticle approach is to restrict the yang - mills path integral to those gauge field configurations , which can be represented as a linear superposition of a small number of building blocks , typically around @xmath9 .",
    "the building blocks are gauge field configurations , which are localized in euclidean spacetime .",
    "we refer to these building blocks as pseudoparticles , where the term pseudoparticle refers to the fact that the corresponding gauge field configurations are also localized in time in contrast to ordinary particles , which are only localized in space . in our context",
    "a pseudoparticle is not necessarily a solution of the classical yang - mills equations of motion .",
    "every pseudoparticle or building block has certain parameters , a position , an amplitude and a color orientation , which uniquely define the resulting gauge field configuration .",
    "it is important to stress that in general a sum of such pseudoparticles is not even close to a classical solution , as it is the case e.g.  in instanton gas models ( c.f .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the pseudoparticle approach is supposed to describe full quantum physics and not only certain semiclassical corrections .",
    "the integration over all gauge field configurations in the path integral is replaced by an integration over the amplitudes and color orientations of the pseudoparticles . when considering a spacetime region containing a finite number of pseudoparticles",
    ", this is an ordinary multidimensional integral , which can be computed by monte - carlo methods .",
    "the starting point of this work has been @xcite .",
    "however , there are two important generalizations :    * we do not restrict our approach to regular gauge instantons and merons .",
    "a pseudoparticle can be any localized gauge field configuration .",
    "for example we also employ pseudoparticles with a limited range of interaction or without topological charge . * in addition to a color orientation matrix we assign to each pseudoparticle a variable amplitude . in this way pseudoparticles",
    "are also able to model small quantum fluctuations .",
    "note that the pseudoparticle approach is a general technique , which is in no way restricted to su(2 ) yang - mills theory . with minor modifications it can also be applied to other quantum field theories , e.g.  quantum mechanics ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .      for the major part of this work we consider the following pseudoparticles : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and + @xmath12 .",
    "each pseudoparticle has an index @xmath13 , an amplitude @xmath14 , a color orientation matrix @xmath15 , a position @xmath16 and a size @xmath17 .",
    "when considering a single pseudoparticle , a color orientation matrix is equivalent to a global gauge transformation .",
    "since such a global gauge transformation can be specified by an element of su(2 ) , for which @xmath18 is a suitable parameter space , it can be expressed in terms of @xmath19 , i.e.  @xmath20 : @xmath21 ( c.f .",
    "appendix  [ sec_012 ] ) .",
    "note that euclidean lorentz transformations are equivalent to color rotations , when considering a single instanton or antiinstanton @xcite , while a single akyron is form invariant under such lorentz transformations .",
    "therefore euclidean lorentz transformations have been included by considering arbitrary color orientations .",
    "setting @xmath22 in ( [ eqn_001 ] ) yields an instanton in regular gauge @xcite .",
    "although for @xmath23 such pseudoparticles are not actually instantons , we nevertheless refer to them by that term . for @xmath22",
    "the action of an instanton is @xmath24 , otherwise it is @xmath25 .",
    "the topological charge is given by @xmath26 with exception of a sign reversal in ( [ eqn_004 ] ) the same applies for antiinstantons ( [ eqn_002 ] ) .    a single akyron pure gauge ( literally `` without effect '' ) .",
    "] is a pure gauge , i.e.  @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that for linear superpositions of akyrons @xmath29 in general , due to the non - abelian nature of su(2 ) .",
    "however , any such superposition has vanishing topological charge density ( c.f .  appendix  [ sec_013 ] ) .",
    "a common and essential property of instantons , antiinstantons and akyrons is their long range nature . for large @xmath30",
    "the corresponding gauge fields decrease like @xmath31 . as a consequence",
    "these pseudoparticles have the ability to interact over large distances .",
    "an important reason for considering pseudoparticles ( [ eqn_001 ] ) and ( [ eqn_002 ] ) is their similarity to regular gauge instantons and merons , which are known to exhibit confinement @xcite .",
    "we additionally include akyrons ( [ eqn_003 ] ) so that the gauge field has both a transverse part and a longitudinal part ( superpositions of instantons and antiinstantons form transverse gauge fields , whereas superpositions of akyrons form longitudinal gauge fields ; c.f .  appendix  [ sec_13 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , one can show that in the continuum limit , i.e.  in the limit of infinitely many pseudoparticles , instantons ( or antiinstantons ) and akyrons form a basis of all gauge field configurations ( c.f .  appendix  [ sec_014 ] ) .",
    "finally , numerical studies with different types of pseudoparticles have shown that observables are not very sensitive to moderate changes in the definition of the pseudoparticles .",
    "for example replacing @xmath32 by @xmath33 in ( [ eqn_001 ] ) to ( [ eqn_003 ] ) hardly affects numerical results , if @xmath34 is sufficiently large ( c.f .",
    "section  [ sec_009 ] ) .",
    "it seems that results in the pseudoparticle approach mainly depend on certain `` global pseudoparticle properties '' , like their ability to interact over sufficiently large distances or whether they carry topological charge or not .",
    "we put @xmath35 pseudoparticles with randomly and uniformly chosen positions inside a hyperspherical spacetime volume ( c.f .",
    "[ fig_001 ] ) .    a 4-dimensional spacetime hypersphere of radius @xmath36 with @xmath37 pseudoparticles ( pseudoparticles are symbolized by dark gray circles ) .",
    "]    in the following we denote the radius of this spacetime hypersphere by @xmath36 and its volume by @xmath38 .",
    "these quantities are related according to @xmath39 .",
    "the pseudoparticle density is given by @xmath40 .",
    "for most calculations we consider @xmath41 pseudoparticles ( [ eqn_001 ] ) to ( [ eqn_003 ] ) with size @xmath42 and pseudoparticle density @xmath43 .",
    "this amounts to @xmath44 .",
    "the gauge field is a linear superposition of instantons , antiinstantons and akyrons : @xmath45 ( the indices @xmath13 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 assume values from different ranges ) . in accordance with the ratio of transverse and longitudinal gauge field components , which is @xmath48 , we choose @xmath49 + ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the corresponding pseudoparticle numbers ) .",
    "although in the limit of infinitely many pseudoparticles instantons by themselves form a basis of all transverse gauge fields , i.e.  applying instantons and antiinstantons would yield an overcomplete basis , we consider an equal number of instantons and antiinstantons , when using a finite number of pseudoparticles .",
    "our ensembles are then symmetric with respect to topological charge ( c.f .",

    "a crucial property of any trustworthy numerical method is that dimensionless ratios of dimensionful quantities , e.g.  @xmath74 or @xmath75 , do not depend on the coupling constant , i.e.  that dimensionful quantities scale consistently .",

    "however , unlike in lattice gauge theory we only have approximate gauge invariance when working with a finite number of degrees of freedom . whether this approximate gauge invariance is a problem can be tested by numerical calculations . a suitable way of doing that is to fix the gauge and to perform computations similar to those without gauge fixing . in the pseudoparticle approach",
    "a particularly convenient gauge is lorentz gauge , i.e.  @xmath89 , which amounts to considering only instantons and antiinstantons but no akyrons .",

    "in contrast to lattice gauge theory we always work in the continuum , i.e.  we do not discretize spacetime . this might be an advantage when calculating glueball masses from correlation functions , because due to exact rotational symmetry it is possible to project out states with a well defined angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the pseudoparticle approach has a high potential when dealing with fermionic problems , because there is no fermion doubling in such a continuum formulation .",
    "another difference lies in the number of degrees of freedom , which is significantly smaller in the pseudoparticle approach than it is in typical lattice calculations ( @xmath90 degrees of freedom , when using @xmath9 pseudoparticles , compared to e.g.  @xmath91 degrees of freedom on a `` small '' @xmath92-lattice ) .",

    "a major new direction is to include fermions in the pseudoparticle approach .",
    "the goal would be to obtain a model for su(2 ) yang - mills theory , which exhibits both chiral symmetry breaking and a confinement deconfinement phase transition .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank frieder lenz for lots of inspiring discussions as well as for making many important and helpful suggestions .",
    "furthermore , i would like to acknowledge useful conversations with philippe  de  forcrand , john  w.  negele and jan  m.  pawlowski .",
    "a color orientation is a spacetime independent gauge transformation .",
    "it can be specified by an element of su(2 ) : @xmath271 with @xmath272 .",
    "applying such a gauge transformation to a gauge field @xmath273 yields @xmath274 or expressed in components @xmath275 we refer to @xmath276 as color orientation matrix .",
    "color orientation matrices fulfill @xmath277 therefore , they are elements of so(3 ) .",
    "the gauge field of a single akyron with index @xmath13 , amplitude @xmath58 , color orientation matrix @xmath278 and position @xmath61 is given by @xmath279 ( c.f .",
    "( [ eqn_003 ] ) ) . in the corresponding field strength",
    "the derivative terms cancel each other : @xmath280 for any linear superposition of akyrons @xmath281 the same is true : @xmath282 for the topological charge density follows @xmath283",
    "any gauge field @xmath284 can be written as a sum of plane waves : @xmath285 where @xmath286 , the fourier transform of @xmath284 , is given by @xmath287    the fourier transformed gauge field @xmath286 can be decomposed in a transverse and a longitudinal part : @xmath288 with @xmath289    superpositions of instantons ( [ eqn_001 ] ) and antiinstantons ( [ eqn_002 ] ) form transverse gauge fields , whereas superpositions of akyrons ( [ eqn_003 ] ) form longitudinal gauge fields .",
    "this can be seen by considering the fourier transforms of these pseudoparticles : @xmath290 where @xmath291 ( @xmath292 is a modified bessel function of imaginary argument ) .",
    "( [ eqn_021 ] ) and ( [ eqn_022 ] ) satisfy ( [ eqn_019 ] ) due to the antisymmetry of @xmath293 and @xmath294 , while ( [ eqn_023 ] ) obviously fulfills ( [ eqn_020 ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we show that `` almost any gauge field configuration '' can be represented by a linear superposition of infinitely many instantons and akyrons .",
    "the starting point is the `` continuum limit '' of ( [ eqn_005 ] ) without antiinstantons : @xmath295 ( the sum over all pseudoparticles has been replaced by an integration over spacetime ; furthermore , nine instantons and three akyrons are allowed to share the same position ) .    inserting ( [ eqn_001 ] ) and ( [ eqn_003 ] ) in ( [ eqn_025 ] ) yields @xmath296 it can be shown that in general nine color orientation matrices form a basis of all @xmath297-matrices @xcite .",
    "therefore , any @xmath298 and @xmath299 can be realized by suitably chosen amplitudes @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "hence , the problem has been reduced to the question whether any gauge filed configuration @xmath284 can be represented by suitably chosen @xmath298 and @xmath299 .      without loss of generality",
    "we consider @xmath304 : @xmath305 for @xmath306 this equation can be solved for + @xmath307 , because @xmath308 and + @xmath309 . for @xmath310 both @xmath303 and @xmath311",
    "are singular . to study this case , we first deduce @xmath312 from ( [ eqn_026 ] ) by applying a proper regularization scheme .",
    "( [ eqn_028 ] ) implies @xmath313 . inserting this in ( [ eqn_027 ] )",
    "+ shows that the value of @xmath314 has no effect on the gauge field @xmath284 . on the other hand ,",
    "changing @xmath314 amounts to a constant shift of @xmath315 : @xmath316 .",
    "that is adding @xmath317 changes @xmath315 , whereas the gauge field @xmath284 remains unaltered .",
    "to get rid of this redundancy , we require @xmath318 to be able to represent any gauge field configuration @xmath284 , we have to find a way around ( [ eqn_028 ] ) .",
    "this can easily be achieved by adding constants @xmath319 to ( [ eqn_025 ] ) .",
    "the final result is the following : any gauge field configuration @xmath284 has a unique expansion @xmath320 in terms of @xmath300 and @xmath301 constrained by ( [ eqn_029 ] ) and @xmath319 , where @xmath321 , @xmath322 , as well as @xmath323 , + @xmath324 are linearly independent color orientation matrices .",
