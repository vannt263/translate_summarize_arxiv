    "wise observables of interest : mean energy @xmath6 , mean  squared distances between monomers @xmath7 , mean  squared radius of gyration @xmath8 , static structure factor @xmath9 , and many others . while some of these observables permit direct experimental measurement and simple evaluation at the level of mean  field theories , the whole range of information contained in the pair correlation functions is only accessible in part to the most sophisticated of modern polymer theories @xcite . on the other hand , computer simulations based on monte carlo metropolis technique ,",
    "if performed on a large enough scale for gathering sufficiently large statistics , can yield accurate values of @xmath10 on a given spherical mesh @xmath11 via computing histograms of monomer occurrences in spherical layers around other monomers .",
    "considerable simulational effort in this area @xcite has been largely inspired by the predictions of the universal scaling behaviour in the field theoretical approaches ( e.g. based on the de gennes @xmath12 formalism ) developed by j.  de cloizeaux @xcite , b.  duplantier @xcite and some others @xcite .",
    "as simulations have grown larger , the agreement with the theoretically computed exponents has improved to a satisfactory level @xcite .",
    "many results , however , were only known for an open homopolymer chain in the repulsive regime ( good solvent ) , apart from the exact case of the gaussian chain .    in the current work",
    "we shall undertake a more systematic study of the pair correlation functions and related observables for polymers of varying length in a wide range of the degree of polymerisation @xmath13 units ; with either open , ring or star ( with different numbers of arms @xmath14 ) architectures ; with flexible or semi  flexible ( with stiffness @xmath15 ) chain ; as well as for the cases of good and poor solvents .    generally , the introduction of a more complex chain architecture , stiffness , or attraction , would pose a serious challenge for field ",
    "theoretic formulations and renormalisation group calculations , and hence only a few scaling results are known for the correlation functions in such cases . moreover , the so(n)-@xmath16 field theory , which relates to the polymer diagrams , was previously only studied up to several loops @xcite . recently , however , new results up to seven loops have been reported in @xmath17 dimensions @xcite .",
    "these , by themselves , would not necessarily yield a better precision because of poor asymptotic convergence of the series , but aided by the borel ",
    "resummation renormalisation group techniques , the convergence can be dramatically improved and errors in the exponents reduced .",
    "thus , it is important to re  examine the agreement of the theory with simulations even in the previously studied case of an open flexible coil , as well as to investigate other architectures .",
    "bearing in mind that the theoretical scalings only apply for sufficiently long chains , it is also instructive to analyse the data for different chain lengths , and to study dependencies on various model parameters generally to address the degree of universality in the scaling laws .",
    "the current coarse  grained homopolymer model is based on the following hamiltonian ( energy functional ) @xcite in terms of the monomer coordinates , @xmath18 : @xmath19 here the first term represents the connectivity structure of the polymer with harmonic springs of a given strength @xmath20 introduced between any pair of connected monomers ( which is denoted by @xmath21 ) .",
    "the second term represents the bending energy penalty given by the square of the local curvature with a characteristic stiffness @xmath22 between any three consecutively connected monomers ( which is denoted by @xmath23 ) in the form of the kratky  harris ",
    "hearst term @xcite . finally , the third term represents pair  wise non  bonded interactions between monomers such as the van der waals forces and so on . in a simple homopolymer model we can adopt the lennard  jones of the potential , @xmath24 where there is also a hard core part with the monomer diameter @xmath25 ( below we choose @xmath26 without any lack of generality ) .",
    "we use the monte carlo technique with the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite , which converges to the gibbs equilibrium ensemble , based upon the implementation described by us in ref . .",
    "simulations were performed for an ensemble of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 when additional symmetries of the system were present ) of independently generated initial conditions , each of which has been first equilibrated by typically @xmath29 of attempted monte carlo steps . to ensure proper equilibration ,",
    "the long and short  time behaviour of the global observables , such as e.g. the @xmath6 and @xmath8 , was monitored , as these cease to have a global drift and start exhibiting characteristic fluctuating behaviour around well defined mean values upon reaching the equilibrium state for given values of the interaction parameters . after reaching the equilibrium , @xmath30 of statistical measurements for each initial condition have been performed .",
    "these measurements were separated by typically @xmath31 of attempted monte carlo steps in between to ensure statistical independence of sampling .",
    "thus , overall the averaging statistics was of order @xmath32 in all cases . the mean value and error of sampling of an observable @xmath33 are then given by the arithmetic mean @xmath34 and by @xmath35 respectively . for more details on our monte carlo technique we refer to the previous papers refs .",
    "the intra  chain correlation function of a pair of monomers @xmath36 and @xmath37 is defined as , @xmath38 the second equation establishes that it is a function of radius @xmath39 only due to spatial isotropy ( so(3 ) rotational symmetry ) .",
    "we may note that this function should , strictly speaking , be named distribution function , but since @xmath40 when @xmath41 because of the chain connectivity , we apply the term ` correlation function ' to @xmath5 itself rather than to the quantity @xmath42 , which would vanish as @xmath41 in the case of simple liquids .",
    "the function is normalised to unity via : @xmath43 .",

    "the mean  squared distance between monomers @xmath36 and @xmath37 is , @xmath46 which we defined here without the traditional factor of @xmath47 as compared to previous paper ref .  .",
    "then the mean  squared radius of gyration is simply , @xmath48    finally , for analysis of the polymer shape we can define the non  averaged _ shape tensor _",
    "@xcite , @xmath49 which is related to the inertia tensor @xmath50 in the case when all monomers have equal masses .",
    "let us also introduce the traceless tensor @xmath51 and the ` mean ' value of the eigenvalues @xmath52 , where the trace of @xmath53 according to eqs .",
    "( [ rg],[tens ] ) coincides with the non  averaged squared radius of gyration , namely : @xmath54 .",
    "one can study the mean ratios of the eigenvalues @xcite , @xmath55 in addition , we can define the following two asphericity characteristics , @xcite , @xmath56 alternatively , we can consider modified quantities , @xcite @xmath57 which are more amenable to analytical treatments , although less sensitive on the shape of conformations .",
    "ring polymers are the simplest objects of study since they possess exact translational invariance along the chain , so that all single  point observables are constants and all pair  wise observables are functions of the separation in the chain indices @xmath58 rather than of both indices @xcite , i.e. @xmath59 , @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkring ] we exhibit the mean  squared distances @xmath61 of flexible ring homopolymers vs the separation @xmath62 .",
    "there is an additional symmetry property of rings such that @xmath61 is also symmetric with respect to the middle ( i.e. maximal separation along the chain ) , namely @xmath63 .",
    "this function has a characteristic bell  shape ( which would become somewhat deformed in case of semi  flexible polymers ) , and this shape agrees very well with that from the gaussian self  consistent ( gsc ) method ( see e.g. fig .",
    "2a in ref . ) .",
    "this function also appears to possess an approximate scaling transformation property , so that curves with different @xmath64 can be superimposed into each other by the transformations : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the value of the flory swelling exponent .",
    "such rescaled quantities @xmath68 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkresc ] for both the coil ( in a good solvent ) and the globule ( in a poor solvent ) . for",
    "the coil , @xmath68 coincide with each other very closely everywhere except around the middle of the range @xmath69 , where such agreement is less accurate .",
    "however , without rescaling , @xmath61 is strongly dependent on both @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath64 is relatively weak only for @xmath62 corresponding to a few polymer links , where connectivity is directly manifested .",
    "similarly , without rescaling , the intra ",
    "chain pair correlation functions @xmath70 are strongly dependent on both @xmath62 and @xmath64",
    ". however , if we introduce the rescaled pair correlation function in terms of the dimensionless variables , @xmath71 these would permit much more straightforward comparison with each other . note that @xmath72 satisfies the following two normalisation conditions : @xmath73    thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkring ] we present @xmath74 for @xmath62 corresponding to the half  ring chain separation for different values of the degree of polymerisation @xmath64 .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the dashed curve here corresponds to a different connectivity constant and this will be discussed later on .",
    "the two lower curves coincide with each other remarkably well , except for very small values of @xmath75 , which are affected by the hard ",
    "core part of volume interactions in the area of direct steric repulsion @xmath76 ( see also eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the same is true of @xmath74 curves corresponding to different chain separations @xmath62 , except very small values of @xmath77 for which @xmath61 is of order of several @xmath78 units , i.e. where @xmath79 .",
    "we may remark that at such very small @xmath62 any particular polymer model ( e.g. bead  and  anharmonic  springs one or a freely  jointed one ) would in any case exhibit its model ",
    "specific features , and hence would no longer produce a universal behaviour .",
    "one can see that the function @xmath80 is non  monotonic : it increases for small @xmath75 , reaches a maximum at around @xmath81 and then decreases in a gaussian  like manner , being almost zero for @xmath82 .",
    "the short  distance behaviour , which is often called the _ correlation hole _",
    "@xcite , is an effect of the excluded volume interactions coming from repulsions mediated through higher than direct binary contacts described by eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .    from this interpretation",
    "one would expect that the correlation hole size should decrease upon decreasing the excluded volume size @xmath25 relative to the kuhn length @xmath83 .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be seen from the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkring ] , which has been obtained for a polymer with a twice weaker spring constant @xmath84 . the correlation hole size decreases , and the value of @xmath85 there correspondingly increases to keep the normalisation condition and hence the function reaches the maximum earlier .",
    "the effect is the opposite at distances @xmath86 , but much weaker , and the tail at larger @xmath75 is practically unaffected by this change of connectivity parameter .",
    "we would like to emphasise that while the change in the correlation hole with the kuhn length is quite dramatic , it is by no means unexpected . evidently , as much weaker springs are considered ( with @xmath25 fixed ) , we should approach the gaussian law for the correlation function , @xmath87 , as well as for the mean  squared distances , and the effect of cross  over behaviour is indeed so clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkring ] .",
    "after collapse of the coil , the mean  squared distances @xmath61 of the globule at the van der waals attraction @xmath88 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkglob ] vs the chain separation @xmath62 for different chain lengths @xmath64 .",
    "these functions increase rapidly at small @xmath62 , quickly reaching a stable plateau scaling as @xmath89 at @xmath90 .",
    "the plateau is related to the nearly constant density within the globule .",
    "the shapes of @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkglob ] agree with those from the gsc method ( see solid line in fig .",
    "2a in ref .",
    "and curve marked llg in fig . 2 in ref . ) .",
    "rescaled curves @xmath91 vs @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkresc ] lie fairly close to each other . with increasing @xmath64",
    "the plateau height in @xmath68 slightly decreases , reaching its asymptotic value as the cross  over scale vanishes : @xmath93 , so that the normalisation @xmath94 remains constant .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkglob ] we present the rescaled correlation functions @xmath95 of the globule for several different values of @xmath62 .",
    "these , for small @xmath75 , have several peaks of increasing width and decreasing height located at integer multiples of the excluded volume diameter @xmath96 , which is similar to the behaviour of correlation functions in simple liquids @xcite .",
    "for large @xmath75 this behaviour changes into a monotonically decreasing tail .",
    "all functions @xmath95 for chain separations @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the same cross  over index as in @xmath61 , lie very close to each other and to the half  ring function @xmath99 .",
    "thus , as long as the chain separations @xmath62 are not directly affected by the chain connectivity , the idea of a single master function in terms of the dimensionless variables is still valid for the globule , although the function is much more complicated than for the coil .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that peaks in @xmath70 occur at @xmath96 , so that for @xmath100 to fall onto a single function @xmath61 has to become @xmath62-independent , which indeed happens beyond @xmath98 .",
    "importantly , the curves @xmath101 do not fall onto a single master curve for different chain lengths @xmath64 here . indeed",
    ", the number of peaks in @xmath101 can be estimated as proportional to the linear size of the globule , which is of order @xmath102 .",
    "thus , for a very large @xmath64 we shall have a function containing a sharp and narrow first peak followed by many oscillations decreasing in amplitude around a constant level ( related to the constancy of the density inside the globule ) and ended by a monotonically decreasing tail .      rescaled correlation functions of an open chain are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkopen ] .",
    "the ring symmetry no longer applies here , so that @xmath103 now explicitly depends on both chain indices .",
    "we note that the reflection symmetry @xmath104 is the only exact symmetry of an open chain .",
    "thus , in obtaining the correlation functions , we may average over two possibilities for the end  internal and internal  internal correlations .",
    "as for the end  end correlation function only single possibility exists hence leading to @xmath105 times worse statistics in this case . since the averaging statistics is the worst for an open chain as compared to other architectures considered in this paper , we present the correlation functions here via data points and smooth curves approximating them ( this will be discussed in more detail in sec . [",
    "sec : scaling ] ) .    clearly , the end monomers have a special rle due to entropic reasons , but correlations of internal monomers on large separations within a very long chain should behave in a similar manner to those of an equivalent ring . indeed , the function @xmath106 ( denoted by dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkopen ] ) practically coincides with that of a ring ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkring ] ) .",
    "however , the functions involving the end monomers have distinct shapes . short  dashed curve of @xmath107 has a higher peak and a somewhat smaller correlation hole area than the middle ",
    "middle correlation function ; the trend continues for the long  dashed curve of @xmath108 , which shows a weak cross  over behaviour ; and the end ",
    "end correlation function @xmath109 ( solid line ) has the tallest peak and the narrowest correlation hole area .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath110 all functions still have practically identical monotonically decreasing tails .      now then",
    ", it would be interesting to understand the effect of chain stiffness determined by the @xmath22 constants in eq .",
    "( [ cmc : hamil ] ) .",
    "thus , let us consider a semi  flexible ring polymer of @xmath111 units with @xmath112 for each triplet of consequently connected monomers and zero otherwise @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkstiff ] we present @xmath100 functions for different values of chain separation @xmath62 . as opposed to similar functions of a flexible ring ( @xmath113 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkring ] , in this case @xmath100 no longer fall onto a single master curve .",
    "a striking feature for relatively small @xmath62 is the expansion of the correlation hole area at small @xmath75 .",
    "the latter is now determined not only by the excluded volume interactions but also by the tendency of the chain to remain locally straight via the stiffness term .",
    "the lowest curve for @xmath114 in fig . [ fig : gkstiff ] shows that this effect is still present for @xmath62 considerably larger than the persistence length of the chain , which is of order @xmath115 . upon increasing @xmath62 the correlation hole shrinks , producing a steeper growth at small @xmath75 , and for large enough @xmath62",
    "the hole becomes even smaller than that of the flexible ring .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "due to the stiffness effect neighbouring monomers along the chain are being pushed away from the current monomer , thus providing an easier access for contacts with it for monomers which are more distant along the chain .",
    "the mismatch of @xmath101 for different @xmath62 is present also at intermediate values of @xmath75 , where a complicated cross  over occurs , and , unusually , even the tails of the distributions do not match perfectly here .",
    "thus , stiffness completely removes the universality of rescaled correlation functions which was present in the flexible case for topologically equivalent monomers .",
    "moreover , manifestations of stiffness are also strongly @xmath64-dependent @xcite and the consideration of the limit @xmath116 is highly non  trivial as it would require renormalisation of @xmath115 , which might significantly change the physical persistent length of the chain .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the case of flexible homopolymer stars with arm length @xmath117 .",
    "we refer the reader for notations , further details and previous results on stars to our preceding work in ref . .",
    "clearly , an open chain may be viewed as a star with @xmath118 arms , so one would like to understand the effect of increasing the arms number , which will be studied in sec . [",
    "sec : scaling ] , but we shall first analyse different correlation functions in a star with sufficiently large @xmath119 .",
    "thus , in fig . [",
    "fig : gkstar ] we present the functions @xmath120 for different @xmath121 for a star with @xmath122 arms in the coil state .",
    "star architecture allows us to use the arms symmetry to increase averaging statistics .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider correlations of three types : core  arm , intra  arm and inter  arm . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : gkstar ] , the shapes of functions @xmath120 corresponding to these three types are very different indeed .",
    "the core monomer plays a very special rle , so the solid ( core  half arm ) and long  dashed ( core  end monomer ) curves in fig . [",
    "fig : gkstar ] show pronounced correlation holes at small @xmath75 due to stronger steric repulsion from the core monomer as @xmath119 increases .",
    "interestingly , @xmath120 grows faster at small @xmath75 in the core ",
    "end case than in the core ",
    "half case .",
    "this may be explained by entropic reasons as it is easier for an end monomer to form a single long loop and return towards the core .",
    "the intra  arm correlation function drawn as short  dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkstar ] has a shape and meaning similar to that of the corresponding function in an open chain ( short  dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkopen ] ) since the core monomer and the rest of the star are typically far from the part of the arm in question .",
    "analogously , the inter  arm end",
    " end correlation function ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkstar ] ) has a similar shape and meaning to that of the end ",
    "end function in an open chain ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkopen ] ) , although the correlation hole is smaller in the latter case .",
    "this is because there are more possibilities for any two ends in a star to encounter each other than to do so for the only two ends of an open chain .",
    "this effect will be numerically investigated for different @xmath119 in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] .",
    "thus , correlation functions of a star are essentially @xmath121-dependent even within monomers of identical topological types ( i.e. inner , end or core ) .",
    "in this section we shall quantify the behaviour of rescaled correlation functions in a good solvent . according to refs .",
    "these , at least in the well known case of an open flexible chain , can be described as a power law times a stretched exponential , so that we can fit @xmath72 there via the following function , @xmath123 for brevity we shall suppress the @xmath121 indices bellow . due to the two normalisation conditions in eq .",
    "( [ normtwo ] ) constants @xmath33 and @xmath124 can be immediately calculated and expressed via @xmath1 and @xmath0 : @xmath125    the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which in the case of end  end correlations of an open chain is denoted as @xmath126 , can be expressed via , @xmath127 where @xmath128 has the meaning of the inverse fractal dimension of the system and @xmath129 is related to the number of different polymer conformations @xcite .",
    "we should , strictly speaking , comment at this stage that for small distances the @xmath126 exponent should , in fact , be replaced by another value @xmath130 , but because @xmath131 is numerically very close to @xmath126 in @xmath17 dimensions , one can use eqs .",
    "( [ fita],[decl ] ) in a single form for all distances .",
    "such formula is often called the des cloizeaux scaling form @xcite .",
    "this expression also works very well for other types of correlations and we shall fit our data via eq .",
    "( [ fita ] ) below .",
    "the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath128 have been derived in refs . .",

    "the exponents @xmath3 , @xmath133 related to the probabilities of contacts of the end ",
    "end , end  internal and internal  internal monomers in an open chain respectively , have been calculated by des cloizeaux in ref . by the renormalisation group technique",
    "based on @xmath134 expansion for the euclidean field theory , as well as by duplantier in ref . and oono _ et al _ in ref .",
    "based on the edwards model .    in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] we present the exponents , based on fitting of our monte carlo data , as well as the best theoretical values known to us ( the latter and the corresponding monte carlo values under comparison are set in bold face ) .",
    "fitting has been done via the the nonlinear least  squares ( nlls ) marquardt  levenberg method @xcite by means of the fit function in the gnuplot software ver .",
    "fit reports parameter error estimates which are obtained from the variance  covariance matrix after the final iteration . by convention",
    ", these estimates are called ` standard errors ' and they have been reported in the tables .",
    "two types of fittings have been independently carried out . in one case ,",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been fitted , while in the other case , @xmath0 was fixed at the theoretical value and hence a more accurate estimate has been achieved .",
    "the latter exponent will be denoted as @xmath135 .",
    "one should bear in mind the reservations that universal exponents values are only asymptotically approached as @xmath64 increases , and that assuming the same power law for both small and large distances is only approximate . yet",
    ", we find our results in a good agreement with the best of theoretical estimates .",
    "first of all , the exponent @xmath0 in cases when fitting errors are the smallest seems quite close to @xmath136 .",
    "the agreement is particularly good in case @xmath137 , where @xmath135 is also very close to theoretical value @xmath138",
    ". this may be in part due to the fact that here the two internal monomers are well separated within the chain , reducing finite  size behaviour .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath0 for the ring is also close to the current exponent , which indicates that as @xmath64 increases the same universal exponent value should be achieved in this case also .",
    "we should comment that a somewhat longer ring with @xmath139 is equivalent to only a @xmath140 open chain though . as for the end ",
    "end case @xmath141 , it is somewhat more intrinsically noisy , since ends have more entropic freedom , so that the agreement with the much more accurately known @xmath126 is only satisfactory .    in the internal",
    " internal case @xmath142 our fitting error is rather minimal , thus our value of @xmath135 here is also very consistent with the ten times more accurate result for the ring .",
    "such improved accuracy is achieved for the ring because here one can average over all pairs of monomers separated by @xmath58 links due to the kinematic symmetry described above .",
    "thus , the error is reduced by an order of @xmath143 , which is also seen in the data .",
    "it is only natural that any two well separated internal monomers in an infinitely long open chain should behave as those of an infinitely long equivalent ring since an extra link between the two ends should not matter .",
    "however , the theoretical estimate for @xmath144 is the least accurate of all , so that higher order calculations akin to those done for @xmath126 recently may be required here too .",
    "moreover , here we can see a cross  over effect discussed in ref . at work . by taking one monomer at the end , and by moving another from @xmath145-chain ( case @xmath146 ) to @xmath147-chain ( case @xmath148 ) and to @xmath149-chain ( case @xmath137 ) ,",
    "the exponent @xmath135 would steadily decrease , and as we reach the other end ( case @xmath141 ) , the smallest value @xmath126 would be reached .",
    "the tilde in front of the theoretical exponents in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] indicates that those exponents are in the cross  over area .",
    "results from fitting of various correlations functions for stars with different @xmath119 in the manner described above are collected in tab .",
    "[ tab:2 ] . in this case , no theoretical exponents are known to us as universality is not a feature of this system .",
    "yet , it is instructive to attempt the fitting even though we realise the finite  size and cross  over nature of the resulting numbers .",
    "this should not be very off  putting though as actually synthesized stars are indeed objects of a few arms of very finite length at present .",
    "first of all , we find again that the stretching exponent @xmath0 agrees within fitting errors with the theoretical value for open and ring chains @xmath136 .",
    "thus , we can concentrate on the discussion of a more accurate exponent , @xmath135 .",
    "clearly , the core monomer has a very special rle , and as the number of arms grows , the steric repulsion around it becomes really significant .",
    "this leads to a rapid expansion of the correlation hole as @xmath119 changes from 3 to 12 , so that values of @xmath135 grow rapidly with @xmath119 for the correlations functions of the core with the middle and ends of arms ( two first rows ) .",
    "as for the intra ",
    "arm correlations generally , these behave more and more as in an open chain as long as the monomers in question are away from the core .",
    "so the middle  end intra  arm exponents ( third row )",
    "@xmath135 are fairly independent of @xmath119 and are close in numerical values to the corresponding exponent @xmath138 of an open chain .",

    "( [ aa ] ) and ( [ ss ] ) introduce the asphericity index @xmath153 and the ellipsoid index @xmath154 .",
    "the latter allows one to further distinguish a prolate ellipsoid ( rod  like ) from an oblate one ( pancake  like ) .",
    "finally , variables @xmath155 and @xmath156 in eqs .",
    "( [ hatas ] ) introduce related fractions of averages , which although less informative are easier to compute analytically @xcite .    in tab .",
    "[ tab:3 ] we have collected these asphericity characteristics for the systems under study .",
    "first of all , we may observe that the ` ellipsoid aspect ratios ' @xmath157 reflect the shape fairly well , although the asphericity index @xmath153 and the ellipsoid index @xmath154 express it in an even more clear way .",
    "as for the observables @xmath155 and @xmath156 , they follow the trends of @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively , although in a somewhat less sensitive manner .",
    "now then , for the ring , open coil and the globule we see that the values depend little on @xmath64 , if the system size is large enough , approaching their universal limits .",
    "the coil of a ring ( first row ) has a smaller asphericity and prolateness ( rod  like shape ) than the corresponding values for an open chain ( third row ) .",
    "we may note also that our values for an open coil are fairly close to those reported in refs . .",
    "the semi  stiff ring ( fourth row ) becomes , clearly , more aspherical and prolate as stiffness @xmath115 increases at fixed @xmath64 . if , however , @xmath115 is kept fixed , and @xmath64 increases both @xmath153 and @xmath154 decrease approaching the flexible chain limit since the ratio @xmath158 presents the relevant degree of flexibility of the polymer .",
    "the globule of a ring ( second row ) is nearly perfectly spherical and only very slightly prolate , as should be expected , and these asymmetries diminish even further as @xmath64 increases .",
    "however , at the same time , the non  equality of @xmath157 is more noticeable here , which shows that they provide less informative asphericity observables .",
    "finally , stars ( fifth row ) starting from a fairly non  spherical and prolate shape at @xmath150 become significantly more spherical and less prolate as the number of arms @xmath119 increases .",
    "this , of course , is consistent with the intuitive idea that a star with a very large number of relatively short arms behaves as a sphere due to strong steric repulsions .",
    "the static structure factor ( ssf ) is of interest due to its relation to the light and neutron scattering techniques and it is standard to introduce it in the rescaled kratky form via , @xmath159 which has an advantage of being less sensitive on @xmath64 .",
    "the factor @xmath160 allows one to emphasise the large @xmath161 behaviour more clearly .",
    "indeed , it is well known @xcite that @xmath162 with @xmath163 and @xmath147 for the repulsive and ideal coils respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath164 would be increasing , reaching a constant asymptote , or decreasing for the repulsive coil , ideal coil and globule respectively .",
    "this is indeed the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : skall ] , where we depict @xmath164 vs @xmath165 for various systems . since curves for the coils ( or the globule ) for different @xmath64 coincided with each other so well due to a nearly perfect universality ,",
    "we only have drawn one particular size in each case .",
    "clearly , for small @xmath165 we have the identical behaviour@xcite , @xmath166 in terms of the rescaled variables in all cases .",
    "the ssf of the globule has a characteristic oscillating behaviour , which shows its dense structure .",
    "it is instructive to compare this with the ssf of a solid sphere@xcite of a radius @xmath167 , @xmath168 by requiring that the cumulant law eq .",
    "( [ ssfas ] ) is universal in terms of the rescaled variables one determines the radius to be @xmath169 .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : skall ] that the ssf of the globule is in a perfect agreement with that of the solid sphere up to the peak point . at larger @xmath165 both functions have rather similar shape , however the ssf of the globule has somewhat smaller amplitude of oscillations , which reflects fluctuations in shape and size of the globule . as additional analysis shows , with increasing @xmath64 the minima of the rescaled ssf of the globule decrease in value , so that @xmath164 asymptotically approaches that of the solid sphere .",
    "the ssf @xmath164 of an open coil has a power  law increasing behaviour , which is preserved for a ring coil as well , although the latter has a slight peak , showing a more spherical structure of a ring in accord with sec .",
    "[ sec : aspher ] .",
    "however , when we introduce even a moderate stiffness for a ring coil , the plot of @xmath164 starts to significantly deviate from that of a flexible ring , and also becomes quite @xmath64 dependent .",
    "this results from the loss of master function universality in the rescaled correlation functions in terms of @xmath64 , which we have seen for a semi  flexible coil in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : stiff ] .",
    "now , if we turn our attention to the structure factors of stars with different numbers of arms in fig .",
    "[ fig : skstar ] , we can see how the starting case of @xmath150 , which is quite reminiscent of the curve of an open chain , transforms into a shape corresponding to more spherical objects as @xmath119 increases ( as we have also seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : aspher ] ) .",
    "again , the @xmath119-dependence here is quite dramatic , although @xmath164 still increases for large @xmath165 as the stars are in an extended state .",
    "in this paper we have studied the correlation functions and related observables for a single homopolymer chain with several macromolecular architectures .",
    "a ring case is the most symmetric one and here we have discovered the universality of the dimensionless correlation functions @xmath101 for all chain index separations beyond small scale @xmath170 . here",
    "the universality also holds for different chain lengths @xmath64 .",
    "the universality appears to be valid in terms of @xmath62 for the globular state as well , although the scale index is of order @xmath171 there , and the correlation functions have a complicated oscillating behaviour .",
    "interestingly , the original function @xmath172 is also @xmath62-universal for the globule , which is consistent with the behaviour of the pair correlation function akin to that of simple liquids , so that the peaks in @xmath172 occur at integer multiples of the hard core diameter @xmath173 , requiring for @xmath61 to become constant beyond @xmath174 .    for the coil the functions @xmath101 can be accurately fitted via a power law times a stretched exponential  the des cloizeaux scaling function eq .",
    "( [ fita ] ) .",
    "the stretching exponent @xmath0 , related to the fractal dimension of the chain , as well as the power exponent @xmath1 , related to the correlation hole effect , are found to be close to the results of theoretical calculations in the special case when the kuhn length is chosen equal to the hard sphere diameter : @xmath175 .",
    "this strong repulsion regime is a special one because it most closely corresponds to the continuous model of the polymer chain .",
    "however , we have found that decreasing @xmath84 results in a significant change in the power law exponent @xmath1 , even though the long  distance exponent is less affected by that .",
    "this may be easily understood as a cross  over to the gaussian chain behaviour , namely @xmath176 and @xmath177 as @xmath178 .",
    "strong sensitivity of the correlation hole on the model parameters also demonstrates that care should be taken when comparing universal renormalisation group predictions with results from simulations of concrete systems .",
    "clearly , the ends play a special rle for an open chain .",
    "therefore , one has to distinguish the end ",
    "end , end  internal and internal  internal correlations with the corresponding exponents @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is found to be universal for strongly  repulsive flexible coils of any architecture and numerically very close to that of the ring chain and to the theoretical prediction .",
    "fitting @xmath72 via the des cloizeaux expression in the strong repulsion regime ( @xmath175 ) has produced values fairly close to the results of theoretical calculations .",
    "the effect of cross  over , when the internal monomer is placed in different locations along the chain , is also observed .    in our study of the semi ",
    "flexible ring chain we have observed a total lack of the @xmath62- or @xmath64- universality in @xmath100 . the correlation hole at small @xmath75 is particularly sensitive on @xmath62 even for chain separations @xmath62 well exceeding the persistence length parameter @xmath179 .",
    "naturally , the correlation hole expands for small @xmath62 due to the stiffness of the chain and consequently contracts for larger @xmath62 .",
    "we may note also that in the latter case the behaviour of @xmath74 is somewhat similar to that of the chain with loose springs , leading to smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "in the case of star polymers one has to distinguish the special rle of the core monomer in addition to the end monomers , as well as the intra and inter  arm correlations .",
    "generally , in the coil state here we have a des cloizeaux scaling behaviour with nearly universal @xmath0 , but with the exponent @xmath1 being strongly sensitive on the monomer indices @xmath121 , number of arms @xmath119 , as well as on the arm length @xmath180 .",
    "a somewhat more stable behaviour for @xmath1 was only seen for the intra ",
    "arm correlations when both monomers are fairly far along the arm from the core monomer , agreeing with the numerical values of @xmath181 in an open chain .",
    "we have also studied the average shape of the above described polymers by means of computing the asphericity characteristics .",
    "we have found that the coil of an open chain is fairly aspherical and prolate ( rod  like ) , while the coil of a ring is less so .",
    "interestingly , the coil of a semi  stiff ring becomes more aspherical and prolate than that of the flexible ring as @xmath115 increases or @xmath64 decreases .",
    "star polymers in the coil state are fairly aspherical and prolate for small numbers of arms @xmath119 , becoming more spherical as @xmath119 increases . finally , the globule of a ring is nearly perfectly spherical .",
    "the static structure factor , related to the sum of the 3-d fourier transforms of the correlation functions , has been investigated in terms of its appropriate scaling variables .",
    "behaviour at small rescaled wave numbers @xmath165 is universal , while the large @xmath165 tail scales as a power law with the exponent related to the fractal dimension of the object . in cases of the flexible open chain , the ring coil and the globule the functions @xmath164 have shapes practically independent of polymer length @xmath64 , which however is not true for semi ",
    "flexible polymers .",
    "likewise , functions @xmath164 are strongly dependent on the number of arms @xmath119 for star polymers .    finally , let us emphasise that we have only discussed the globule of a ring here because most of the results would be little , if at all , affected by the change of the connectivity matrix in the dense globular state , although this is a much more complicated issue meriting a separate study in case of fairy stiff chains , where , as we know , transitions into toroidal globules take place @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we have seen that the degree of universality of various scaling functions and exponents is subject to more serious limitations than have been previously realised .",
    "the knowledge of various correlation functions of the polymer chain and their response to changes of various parameters provides us with the most detailed insight into the structure of the system .",
    "development of theoretical methods , which could reproduce various features observed in this paper , is important for tackling larger system sizes and more complicated systems such as heteropolymers , for which simulations have severe limitations .",
    "this work is currently in progress and we hope to be able to return to such subject in the near future .",
