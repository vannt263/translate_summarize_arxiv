    "while interaction - induced star formation is thought to be primarily responsible for ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , which have @xmath13 ) both locally and at high redshift @xcite , luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath14 ) appear to have multiple driving mechanisms , merger - induced star formation being only one .",
    "luminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies are thought to be the dominant producers of the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) , and major contributors to the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate ( csfr ) of galaxies , especially at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the rapid decline from @xmath8 of the csfr density has been linked to a decline in the merger rate .",
    "however , recent close pair studies have suggested that the merger rate has remained fairly constant from @xmath8 @xcite , and at @xmath15 the ir population is dominated by morphologically normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two results suggest that the bulk of star formation at @xmath8 is not driven by major mergers .",
    "however it must be noted that different merger selection criteria probe different stages of the merger process .",
    "quantitative measurements of galaxy asymmetry ( @xcite ) are more likely to probe later stages , while early stage mergers can be identified by carefully searching for close companions .",
    "there should be some overlap between these techniques if galaxy pairs are close enough to have induced strong tidal interactions , but galaxies in pairs could also have normal morphologies , hence if early stage mergers are not considered , the impact interactions / merging have will be underestimated .",

    "for the 2003 pre - launch campaign , targets were selected based on nir ( @xmath35 ) and optical ( @xmath36 ) colors .",
    "the primary sample included sources with @xmath35@xmath3720.2 , @xmath3819.0 and a @xmath36 color selection that restricted the numbers of low redshift ( @xmath39@xmath300.6 ) sources .",
    "for the 2004 post - launch campaign , a purely 24  selected sample ( @xmath40@xmath41120@xmath42jy ) was targeted for follow - up .",

    "the remaining 231 ( 49% ) are non - detected at 24 . despite the fact that the mips and non - mips galaxies were selected slightly differently , the resultant colors of objects with spectroscopic redshifts have uniform color properties ( figure [ fig : colors ] ) .",
    "to properly constrain the role interactions and mergers play in galaxy evolution , all stages of the process must be considered .",
    "typically , merger history analyses utilize either pair or structural methods .",
    "galaxies in pairs are pre - mergers , or systems undergoing interactions , while morphological or structural methods find galaxies that have already undergone a merger and are dynamically relaxing .",
    "when discussing the pair fraction , and inferred merger rates ( as defined in section 4 ) , it must be noted that these measurements are highly dependent on the techniques and selection criteria used to identify ongoing mergers , especially for galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the first method , which we will call the  close pair method \" , is to count the number of galaxy pairs within some projected separation , @xmath49 , and magnitude difference ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "if we assume that these systems will merge within a given time - scale due to dynamical friction , we can determine the merger rate .",
    "although not all pairs will merge , they can potentially trigger star formation through gravitational interactions .",
    "an alternative is to select merging systems based on morphological indicators either by overall appearance @xcite or computational measurements such as asymmetry ( a ) , and clumpiness ( s ) of a system @xcite , or gini coefficient ( g ) , and @xmath51 parameters @xcite . due to the comparatively limited spatial resolution of _ spitzer _  ( compared with optical imaging ) ,",
    "seaching for close galaxy pairs or morphological signatures of interaction at mid - ir wavelengths is currently restricted to the nearby universe .",
    "however , we can correlate optically - selected pairs / mergers with global mid - ir properties and investigate the ir activity in these systems out to high redshifts .",
    "we applied the close pairs technique to identify the average number of close companions per galaxy , hereafter @xmath52 .",
    "this measurement is similar in nature to the pair fraction when there are infrequent triples or higher order n - tuples .",
    "since this is the case here , @xmath52 will be occasionally referred to as the pair fraction .",
    "companions were selected using a standard operational close pair definition of 5@xmath53kpc@xmath54kpc , and an optical magnitude difference ( @xmath50 ) @xmath55 compared to the host galaxy , to select nearly equal mass major mergers . the term  host \" or ",
    "primary \" galaxy are both used to reference the pair member with a measured redshift .",
    "the inner radius is applied to avoid detection of substructure within a galaxy , while the outer @xmath56kpc limit represents the radius within which satellites are expected to strongly interact with the halo of the host and merge within 0.5 - 0.9 gyrs ( patton et al .",
    "1997 ; conselice et al 2003 ) .",
    "we find 87 close pairs out of 476 galaxies which fulfill these criteria ( see table 1 ) .    to study the fraction of ir - bright galaxies in pairs , we split the pair sample into two sub - sets : those which were detected and those undetected with mips at 24   down to the flux limits of our survey ( 0.1  mjy ) .",
    "figure [ fig : stamps ] shows a subset of close pairs ( both detected and undetected at 24 ) with mips contours . due to the small separations of close pairs ( 20@xmath53kpc corresponds to 3.6  at @xmath8 ) relative to the beam of the mips 24  images ( fwhm @xmath36  ) , there are a few instances ( 5 ) where only a single 24  detection is found centered between the pair members ( see middle left image in figure [ fig : stamps ] ) . in these cases",
    "we assume all 24  flux is coming from the primary galaxy .",
    "since we have redshift information for only the primary galaxy and not the companions we need to consider what fraction of these close pairs are a result of random projection effects .",
    "a field correction was determined using two separate methods to account for these close pairs .",
    "the first assumed the same optical magnitude and redshift distributions independently for both the detected and undetected 24  samples , while the positions were randomized .",
    "the close pair algorithm was applied to 50 realizations of these mock catalogs and the average @xmath52 for each redshift bin was taken to be the pair fraction expected from random .",
    "this assumes the absence of clustering .",
    "we investigated the environments of 24  detected and undetected objects on scales of @xmath57@xmath5820@xmath53kpc , and found them to be comparable , confirming that the increase in pair - fraction of the 24  detected pairs is not because they preferentially lie in clusters . on the other hand",
    ", there is a weak indication that galaxies detected at 24  are more likely to lie in small groups . since such groups may , in some cases , be physical associations , we count such cases as separate pairs . however , the number of these cases is small , and does not influence our results in any significant way .",
    "the second method utilizes the @xmath25 magnitude distribution of the full photometric catalog ( @xmath359,000 sources ) , and determines the average number of companions , within 1.5 mags ( @xmath25 ) , normalized to the area covered by 5@xmath53kpc@xmath54kpc .",
    "the results obtained from the two field correction methods agreed within @xmath59 , which is negligible compared to the uncertainly in @xmath52 .",
    "the average of the two methods was taken to be the final field correction .",
    "both the pair catalog and randomly generated catalogs were visually inspected for false pairs due to single galaxies being broken up into multiple components in the source extraction phase , or contaminating stars in the photometric catalog , and were removed .      the field - corrected optical pair fractions for the 24   detected and undetected sub - samples are presented in figure [ fig : pfrac ] and table 1 .",

    "we ensure that the sub - luminous galaxies do not strongly influence the pair fractions in the lowest redshift bin .",
    "the derived @xmath52 for 24  detected close pairs is @xmath66 at @xmath67 and increases to @xmath68 at z@xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , close pairs with no 24@xmath42 m   detection show no increase with redshift and have pair fractions consistent with zero at all redshifts .",
    "the higher pair fraction of mips bright sources is marginally significant due to the small number of sources in the highest redshift bin , more mir selected samples between @xmath691 - 1.5 are required to strengthen our findings .",

    "we still find an increase in @xmath52 from the lower ( @xmath80 ) to the higher ( @xmath78 ) redshift bins of similar magnitude compared to when the lower ir limit ( @xmath44 ) was used .",
    "therefore the increase in @xmath52 found at @xmath78 is likely not a result of merely probing brighter ir systems but rather due to a physical increase in the merge rate for the 24  population , however deeper 24  imaging and spectroscopy are required to confirm this . when we consider the averaged pair fraction over @xmath81 for the 24  detected sample we find that galaxies above a flux limit of @xmath82mjy are five times more likely to be in a close galaxy pair , than those below this limit .      to explore the structural components of galaxies in our sample we used the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) quantitative classification system @xcite , and visual classifications . to measure the merger fraction using structural classifications we visually inspected the full 24   detected spectroscopic catalog with the following groupings : early type ( e , s0 ) , mid - types ( sa - sb ) , late - types ( sc - irr ) , compact systems , disturbed disks , and mergers .",
    "the methodology for carrying out this classification is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "basically , each galaxy was viewed on a computer screen and classified into one of our types .",
    "overall we find that @xmath83 of 24   detected galaxies are disks , which is consistent with @xcite , while @xmath84 are merging systems and @xmath85 were classified as disturbed disks and are possible minor mergers .",
    "a fraction of the disk - dominated objects do show some visual signs of a morphological disturbance , or are in a pair , as we will discuss later in this paper .",
    "galaxies undergoing a major merger event can also generally be identified by their large asymmetries in the rest frame optical @xcite .",
    "we defined a major merger as a galaxy having an asymmetry ( a ) @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see figure [ fig : stamps2 ] for examples ) .",
    "this limit has been shown to be a clean way to find galaxy mergers , without significant contamination from non - merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mfract ] shows how the merger fraction for cas defined mergers evolves as a function of redshift for both 24  detected objects ( top panel ) and lirg / ulirg galaxies ( bottom panel ) . as with",
    "the 24  detected close pair sample there is an elevated merger fraction compared to other works @xcite in which no 24  flux limit was imposed , and a slight indication of evolution with redshift , but it is statistically consistent with @xmath88 ( dashed line ) , where @xmath89 is the slope of a power - law of form @xmath90 later discussed in @xmath91 .",
    "we also performed a cas analysis of our close pairs sample which revealed that 24  detected pairs are notably more asymmetric than the undetected - mips close pairs ( figure [ fig : cas ] ) , suggesting that interactions and collisions may play a role in their ir activity .",
    "if the 24  detected close pairs were generally of a different morphological classification than those pairs undetected at 24 the discrepancy in the asymmetries could be explained . to address this issue each close pair",
    "was visually inspected and classified by four of the authors to be either disk or bulge - dominated .",
    "we find that 81% of the 24  pairs have disk morphologies while @xmath92 of the undetected 24  hosts were also disk dominated , hence the discrepancy between the asymmetries of the two groups is not caused by classification differences , but rather is a physical effect .",
    "one of the goals of studying mergers and interactions is to determine how the galaxy merger rate evolves with redshift .",
    "most studies of galaxy mergers involve determining the merger fraction , yet the merger rate , which is defined as the number of galaxies merging per unit time per unit volume , is a more physical quantity that can be used to determine the full merger history .",
    "the rate in which galaxies merge also affects the mass function of galaxies , and is likely linked to the cosmic star formation rate . since we are considering a very broad range in the merger process , from early - stage or pre - mergers selected via close galaxy pairs , and later - stage mergers chosen based on morphological criteria , we must be careful when determining their respective merger rates , as the time - scales for these processes are all different .",
    "there are two variations of the merger rate definition .",
    "the first is the number of mergers that a galaxy will undergo per unit time ( @xmath93 ) , and the second is the total number of mergers taking place per unit time per unit co - moving volume ( @xmath94 )",
    ". since we are primarily interested in mergers which are also mid - ir bright systems we will have to restrict ourselves to measuring @xmath93 because the evolution of the 24  luminosity function with redshift is currently not well constrained , and our redshifts are not complete enough to reconstruct this evolution .    in order to determine @xmath93 we need to identify systems which are destined to merge .",
    "we have approached this measurement from three different perspectives , close pairs to select pre - mergers or interactions , visual inspection to select interactions after the first passage , and late stage mergers , as well as cas criteria which quantitatively selects for later stage mergers . by combining information about the number of ongoing mergers ( @xmath95 ) and the time - scales , ( @xmath96 ) on which they will undergo said merger",
    ", one can estimate an overall merger rate @xmath97 .",
    "each method of identifying mergers / interactions is capturing a different snapshot of the merger process , each with different merger timescales .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is directly proportional to the number of mergers per galaxy ( @xmath95 ) , such that @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is a constant relating to the number of mergers per galaxy ) .",
    "hence , the merger rate detemined using close galaxy pairs is given by @xmath100 .",
    "the value of @xmath99 depends on the nature of the merging systems under consideration . if one were to identify a pure set of galaxy pairs each consisting of one companion undergoing a merger , then @xmath101 . in our case",
    "it exclusively accounts for close pairs which are in doubles and perhaps higher order n - tuples .",
    "our definition of @xmath99 differs by a factor two from @xcite which in this instance would have @xmath102 since they have redshifts for both pair members and one merger is made up of two companions .",
    "we have redshift information for only one pair member , therefore one merger is made up of a primary and one companion . the merger rate equation for merging galaxies selected by visual classification and cas parameters",
    "is simply @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the galaxy merger fraction .    before the merger fraction can be used to calculate the merger rate we need to understand the time - scale in which a merger occurs .",
    "each technique of identifying mergers has a different time - scale since each is sensitive to a different interval of the merger process .",
    "there are two main methods that have been used to estimate the time - scale of a merger : dynamical friction arguments , and n - body models .",
    "the details of these methods are beyond the scope of this paper but see @xcite and @xcite for a review .",
    "we take the average merger time - scale for a set of close companions of roughly equal mass to merge as @xmath30.5 gyr@xmath105 , derived from dynamical arguments @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed through n - body simulations that visual classification selects on - going mergers over a longer time - scale ( 1.0 gyr@xmath105 ) since the human eye detects both early and later stage mergers , while the asymmetry of a galaxy is sensitive to 0.41 gyr@xmath106 @xcite of the merger sequence .",
    "within the past two decades numerous studies have been performed to estimate the evolution of the galaxy merger fraction , using both the close pair technique @xcite and morphological parameters @xcite .",
    "evolution in the galaxy merger fraction is often parameterized by a power - law of form @xmath90 , and has yielded a wide range of results , spanning 0@xmath107@xmath89@xmath1075 .",
    "the large spread in values is in part due to the different selection criteria used to identify merging systems and biases from optical contamination or redshift completeness .",
    "@xcite considered these biases and demonstrated that most results to that date were consistent with their estimate of @xmath108 .",
    "recently , optical and near - ir close pair studies @xcite have derived merger fractions with little redshift evolution ( @xmath89@xmath31 ) , as have some morphological studies using ( @xmath109 ) , and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "when we consider all the close pairs identified in our sample , both those detected at 24  and not , we find a merger fraction and rate consistent with recent studies showing little redshift evolution .",
    "however , when we separate the pair sample into systems with a 24  detection above 0.1 mjy , and those below it , we do see a stronger evolution of @xmath52 with redshift , ( recall that @xmath110 ) and therefore also in the merger fraction and rate ( figure [ fig : mr ] ) .",
    "similarly , visually classified mergers and those identified via asymmetry levels ( @xmath111 ) using the cas parameters , also show redshift evolution in the merger fraction and rate . the merger fraction computed using the different methods are in good agreement when normalized by their respective time - scales , reinforcing the idea that we are probing different phases of the merger process . considering all three merger selection techniques we find the best fit of the merger rate parameterized by @xmath112 to be @xmath113 , 2.12 @xmath114 , with a reduced @xmath115=0.39 .",
    "this result suggests that when one considers a sample of close galaxy pairs solely on their optical fluxes , brighter than @xmath116 - 19 , little evolution of the merger rate with redshift is found .",
    "however close pairs emitting 24  flux exhibit an increase in the merger rate with redshift .",
    "the infrared luminosity limit ( @xmath117 ) imposed on the close pairs and mergers allows us to primarily probe systems in a lirg / ulirg phase at @xmath118 ( see next section for details ) .",
    "the increase of the merger fraction and rate of this population of galaxies coupled with the fact that lirg / ulirg galaxies dominate the sfr density at @xmath15 @xcite suggests that merging does in fact play an increasingly important role in star formation out to @xmath8 .",
    "one way to quantify the role merging galaxies play in triggering star formation is to investigate their contribution to ir luminosity densities . infrared luminosities ( 8 - 1000  ) were calculated utilizing the 24  fluxes and two different template methods : @xcite in a similar manner as @xcite for the full mips 24   spectroscopic sample ( figure [ fig : lirall ] ) .",
    "mips pairs and mergers share a similar luminosity distribution to 24  bright field galaxies , although red - agn seem generally more luminous which is in part due to template mismatches @xcite .",
    "the @xmath119 of a galaxy is a combined measure of the reprocessed uv photons intercepted by dust from massive young stars and agn .",
    "therefore to investigate the contribution an interacting or merging galaxy makes towards the total @xmath119 density from star formation alone we must first remove agn from our sample . due to the nonuniform rest - frame spectral coverage of our sample we rely on the four - band irac color selection used by @xcite to identify and remove agn candidates ( figure [ fig : agn ] ) . over the modest redshift range of our sample , this method is still effective at separating ir - warm agn from starburst systems .",
    "we find an agn contamination rate of @xmath120 for the full 24  sample , while @xmath121 of the hosts in a pair or merger were characterized as agn .",
    "with agn candidate objects removed we can infer the contribution to the @xmath119 density from star formation coming from 24  galaxies in a interaction / merger as a function of redshift .",
    "we derive the number of statistically  real \" galaxy pairs from our pair fraction result at each redshift interval and determine the total @xmath119 density from close pairs which is in turn divided by the @xmath119 density from the whole sample .",
    "we find that paired galaxies ( @xmath117 ) are responsible for @xmath122 of the ir background stemming from star formation at @xmath8 .",
    "since we only know the redshift of the host galaxy we select  real \" close pairs in a statistical sense , and derive error bars for the close pairs contribution by the spread of 50 realizations of the @xmath119 density from different combinations of 24  galaxy pairs .",
    "we also applied this analysis to cas and visually classified mergers , which make up an additional @xmath312% , and @xmath322% of the ir luminosity density respectively .",
    "naturally there is a some overlap in mergers identified through close pair criteria and morphological parameters , since interacting pairs can exhibit tidal tails and asymmetric structures , causing them to also be identified morphologically as mergers .",
    "we found that @xmath123 of cas defined mergers were also in a close pair , and 31% of visually identified mergers were also classified by cas as merging . in cases where a merging system was identified using multiple techniques",
    "it s contribution was only counted once .",
    "for example , if a merger identified morphologically ( either through cas or visual inspection ) is also in a close pair it is removed from the morphological merger catalog , or if a cas merger is also identified visually the merger is removed from the visual merger catalog .",
    "this insures that no close pair or merger is counted more than once when deriving the contribution from interactions and mergers to the ir luminosity density .",
    "the combination of these three merger selection techniques identifies a large range in the merger process , from pre - merger to late stage mergers , implying that @xmath360% of the infrared luminosity density at @xmath39@xmath31 can be attributed to galaxies involved in some stage of a major merger ( figure [ fig : lumden ] ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath340% of the ir background from lirg / ulirgs is likely to predominately come from active , isolated gas - rich star - forming spirals , with some contribution from minor mergers .",
    "if we exclude visually classified mergers the close pair / merger contribution to the ir density is @xmath338% , in good agreement with @xcite who estimate a moderate contribution from interacting and merging systems of @xmath5836% .",
    "it must be noted however that neither @xcite or this work have considered the contribution from minor mergers and are therefore lower limits .",
    "an important and highly debated question is : how important are galaxy mergers in understanding the dramatic decline of the cosmic sfr density from @xmath8 to the present day ?",
    "it has been well established that mergers and interactions can induce violent bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "so to investigate this contribution we derived the sfr for our 24  detected close pairs and mergers , using their @xmath119 .",
    "the infrared luminosity of a galaxy is a star formation rate tracer which is unaffected by the extinction of dust .",
    "the dominant heat sources of most dusty , high - opacity systems such as lirgs and starbursts is stellar radiation from young stars . in these types of systems",
    "the @xmath119 can be converted into a sfr using the calibration of @xcite , @xmath124 , where @xmath119 is the integrated luminosity from 8 - 1000  as determined in section 6.0 .",
    "we estimated the contribution mergers and interactions above @xmath117 make to the sfr density at @xmath51 in two ways .",
    "the first is simply to consider their contribution to the @xmath119 density which is a star formation tracer .",
    "section 6.0 determined that mergers and interactions at z@xmath31 ( above @xmath117 ) are responsible for 40 - 60% of the ir luminosity density . using the results of @xcite which showed that @xmath1250.7 lirgs produce @xmath126 of the star formation rate density",
    ", we can infer that mergers and interactions in lirg / ulirg phase would be responsible for @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) of the sfr density at @xmath51 , since ir activity traces dusty star formation .",
    "the second more detailed approach utilizes the sfr density directly arising from our sample of mergers and interactions . at 1.0@xmath30@xmath39@xmath301.3",
    "we find that 59% ( 12 close pairs , and 17 later stage mergers ) of galaxies detected at 24  are involved in some stage of an interaction or merger . in this same redshift",
    "range our sample is insensitive to galaxies with ir luminosities @xmath30@xmath129 . to correct for this we derived a scaling factor ( @xmath37 ) simply by comparing the number of observed objects of a given @xmath119 in a specific redshift range to the number expected from models @xcite .",
    "however to go any further we must assume that our spectroscopic sample is representative of this population at @xmath31 , and by all accounts this appears to be true .",
    "using the derived pair fraction we can then infer the total number of major mergers and interactions occurring ( fulfilling our criteria ) in a given volume and @xmath119 limit .",
    "the lower limit of the sfr density at @xmath51 from merging and interacting galaxies is found to be 0.066 @xmath130 . using the extinction corrected ",
    "lilly - madau \" plot ( 0.1585 @xmath130 at @xmath691 ) @xcite we find that mergers and interactions are responsible for at least @xmath131 of the sfr density at @xmath51 ( assuming mergers contribute 60% of the ir density ) .",
    "both approaches are in good agreement , and are only a lower limit , since objects flagged as agn were not considered even though some of their @xmath119 is a result of star formation , and minor mergers which have been shown to also induce bursts of star formation were not included .",
    "these results have interesting implications for the physical mechanisms that drive the decline in the cosmic sfr ( csfr ) density from @xmath8 to present day .",
    "they suggest that when all stages of the merger process are considered ( pre - merger to later stage merger ) major interactions and mergers contribute close to half of the @xmath8 sfr density , and the decline in the number of 24  detected mergers / inteactions is a significant , but perhaps not the primary driver for the decline in the cosmic sfr .",
    "this conclusion differs in interpretation from @xcite , which generally suggest that the evolution of the merger rate is not a significant underlying cause of the decline in the cosmic sfr , but rather a strong decrease in the sfr of morphologically undisturbed spiral galaxies is the dominant mechanism .",
    "their results do not preclude the possibility that their  star forming ( undisturbed ) disks \" could be in widely separated pairs , and when we only consider quantitatively defined morphological mergers our results are consistent with theirs stressing the importance of considering the merger process in its entirety .",
    "it must also be mentioned that we are probing to higher redshifts than @xcite , which found that major galaxy mergers account for @xmath3030% of the ir luminosity density at @xmath39@xmath30.7 , consistent with our findings of 35% at that redshift .",
    "our results also agree that at @xmath50.7 isolated undisturbed spiral galaxies are a primary contributor , however , the influence shifts to interactions and mergers at @xmath39@xmath410.7 .",
    "our findings point to an increased importance of mips bright interactions and mergers to the ir luminosity density and sfr density at @xmath39@xmath340.7 .",
    "this conclusion is not hampered by the small statistics of the @xmath121 bin .",
    "figure [ fig : lumden ] shows the ir luminosity density contribution from interactions / mergers at @xmath39@xmath30.7 to be @xmath337% and 52% at @xmath39@xmath30.9 , reinforcing this increasing trend .",
    "using a spectroscopic sample of field galaxies from the acs component of the fls and dividing it into two subsets , those with a 24  detection ( above @xmath82mjy ) and those without ( or below ) we identified optically merging / interacting systems via close pair statistics and morphological methods .",
    "we find that roughly 25% of galaxies emitting at 24  have a close companion at @xmath51 while at @xmath50.5 only @xmath132 are in pairs .",
    "in contrast , those undetected at mips 24  showed a pair fraction consistent with zero at all redshifts ( 0.2@xmath30@xmath39@xmath301.3 ) . on average mips",
    "24  galaxies are five times more likely than non - mips sources to have a close companion over 0.2@xmath30@xmath39@xmath301.3 . when the samples are combined ( regardless of 24  flux )",
    "we find pair fractions consistent with previous studies @xcite showing little evolution with redshift .",
    "an important and open question is the cause of star formation in lirg galaxies at high - z .",
    "some morphological studies have suggested that since at least half of the lirg galaxies exhibit disk dominated morphologies @xcite at @xmath1250.7 and low non - evolving merger fractions @xcite that the driver of ir activity in high - z lirgs is from on - going star - formation from isolated gas - rich spirals and not merger or interaction induced .",
    "one bias of @xmath133 morphological studies involving the identification of merging / intereacting systems is the limitation of detecting low surface brightness features such as tidal tails caused by close interactions , which can lead to an underestimate of the importance of mergers in the evolution of galaxies at @xmath1341 .",
    "ultimately both close pair and morphological techniques must be applied and considered , to obtain a complete major merger timeline .",
    "our analysis is the first to probe merger rate evolution combining close pairs and later stage mergers while considering the ir activity of these systems .",
    "we find that close pair statistics , visually classified mergers , and those identified via quantitative cas parameters all showed similar evolution in their merger rates .",
    "fitting the merger rate evolution function @xmath135 for 24  detected mergers above @xmath82mjy , we find @xmath136 .",
    "this result agrees with previous claims of an increase ( @xmath137 ) of the merger rate out to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however this evolution is not seen when ir faint ( @xmath138mjy ) mergers are included , suggesting that it is the lirg - merger population that is evolving with redshift .",
    "the mid - ir emission of lirgs is indicative of dust enshrouded star formation ( and some agn activity ) , and at @xmath15 they dominate the ir luminosity density and in turn the volume - averaged star formation rate density at @xmath8 .",
    "we estimate that close galaxy pairs are responsible for @xmath139 of the ir luminosity density resulting from star formation at @xmath8 , while later stage mergers contribute @xmath140 .",
    "this implies that 40 - 60% of the infrared luminosity density at @xmath8 can be attributed to galaxies involved in some stage of a major merger , indicating that merger - driven star formation is responsible for 30 - 40% of the star formation density at @xmath8 .",
    "this value is a lower limit since minor mergers and interactions / mergers with an agn were not considered .",
    "ultimately , our findings suggest that interactions and mergers of lirg phase galaxies play an increasingly important role in both the ir luminosity and sfr density from @xmath15 out to @xmath141 , and are vital to our understanding of the evolution and mass assembly of luminous ir galaxies .",
