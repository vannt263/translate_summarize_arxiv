    "the hyperspherical harmonics ( hsh ) are an important tool in the study of quantum few - body systems .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the kinetic - energy operator of an @xmath2-particle system is equivalent to the laplace operator in the space of @xmath3 dimensions ( or @xmath4 , in the case of planar systems ) .",
    "the amount of papers in which hsh are applied to specific physical problems is very large .",
    "we mention only few recent review articles @xcite and a book @xcite .",
    "hsh are functions of @xmath5 dimensionless variables ( hyperangles ) which describe the points on the hypersphere .",
    "of course , the choice of hyperangles is not unique and it is the matter of convenience .",
    "the only exception is the three - dimensional space , where the arguments of the spherical harmonics are conventional spherical angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the generalization of this definition on spaces with @xmath8 is the following .",
    "let @xmath9 be the @xmath10-dimensional radius - vector , then the hyperspherical angles are defined by the equations @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15-th rank hsh @xmath16 is defined by the laplace equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denotes the set of indices which label different hsh of the same rank .",
    "the explicit expression for hsh depending on the hyperspherical angles ( [ eq : l-3 ] ) is well - known ( see eq.(11.2.23 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "it is given by the product of gegenbauer ( ultraspherical ) polynomials , so that @xmath20-th polynomial in the product depends on @xmath21 .",
    "however , in many physical applications the set of hyperspherical angles is not convenient .",
    "for example , in the quantum three - body problem one has to deal with six - dimensional vector space being the product of two three - dimensional spaces corresponding to the jacobi vectors , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3bd - jacobi ] .",
    "is the center of mass of the pair @xmath22,@xmath23.,width=188 ]    thus , in this case it is more adequate to parametrize the arguments of hsh by the spherical angles of the three - dimensional vectors @xmath24 .",
    "further aspects of the choice of coordinates in the three - body problem including analysis of the permutational symmetry are discussed in @xcite .",
    "hsh in @xmath3-dimensional space depending on the spherical angles of @xmath2 three - dimensional vectors may serve as a convenient basis for the decomposition of the wave function of the quantum many - particle system .",
    "the arguments of corresponding hsh comprise apart of @xmath4 three - dimensional spherical angles of vectors @xmath25 also @xmath26 hyperangles which describe the lengths @xmath27 .",
    "again , there is freedom in choice of the hyperangles .",
    "for example , one can define the hyperangles similarly to ( [ eq : l-3 ] ) by replacing @xmath28 .",
    "such set of the hyperangles was used in @xcite where the explicit expressions for the corresponding hsh have been derived by means of the explicit solution of the laplace equation .",
    "the physical nature of the problem may suggest different choice of the connection of the hyperangles with the vectors desribing the system .",
    "thus , the problem is how to derive the explicit expression for hsh corresponding to various choices of their arguments .",
    "the conventional approach @xcite , consists in the transformation of the laplacian to the desired hyperangular variables with the subsequent solution of the ensuing partial differential equation .",
    "such approach has been used in @xcite where the number of relations for hsh has been presented using the so - called `` method of trees '' .",
    "it is desirable to develop the technique of the derivation of hsh which would not require the transformation of the laplacian . in the presented paper such",
    "the technique is proposed .",
    "it allows one to derive the expressions for hsh depending on arbitrary set of hyperangles .",
    "the technique is based on the concept of zero - length vectors proposed initially by cartan @xcite .",
    "the developed calculation scheme is recursive , i.e. hsh in space with higher dimensions is presented as the product of lower - dimensional hsh with some weight function being an orthogonal polynomial . as the examples of the proposed technique , various representations for hsh in spaces with @xmath29 are derived .",
    "below the expression for the scalar product of hsh is derived in sec .  [",

    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : d - dim - hsh ] several general expressions for hsh are derived in terms of lower - rank hsh .",

    "[ sec : orth - norm ] .",
    "it is important that the expression for the scalar product of hsh can be derived without the knowledge of their explicit form . in order to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us consider the scalar function @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are @xmath10-dimensional vectors .",
    "obviously , @xmath34 is an homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath15 with respect to the components of @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "namely , @xmath35 one can prove that @xmath34 satisfies the laplace equation with respect to both vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , @xmath36 here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 act on the components of @xmath33 .",
    "we have also used the identity @xmath39 and the fact that the differential operations are commutative .",
    "the proof of @xmath40 is somewhat more lengthy , @xmath41 using the operator identity @xmath42 one can transform the second term in  ( [ eq : gf-0b ] ) to @xmath43 \\frac{1}{r^{d-2 } } = - ( j+d-2 ) ( { \\mathbf{r } } ' \\cdot \\nabla)^j \\frac{1}{r^{d-2}}.\\ ] ] the substitution of this identity into ( [ eq : gf-0b ] ) completes the proof of the equation @xmath40 .    the function @xmath44 is @xmath15-th order homogeneous polynomial satisfying the laplace equations @xmath45 is _ scalar _ and , therefore , it can be nothing else than the scalar product of two hsh of rank @xmath15 , @xmath46^ *   h^j_\\epsilon ( { \\mathbf{\\hat r}}).\\ ] ] the explicit form of @xmath34 can be calculated as follows .",
    "first , we note that the gradient operators in ( [ eq : gf-0 ] ) can be replaced with the derivatives , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath33 and @xmath32 . noting that the function to be differentiated coincides with the generating function for gegenbauer ( or ultraspherical ) polynomials @xcite we can write , @xmath49 at this stage , we note that hsh are defined up the some normalization factor which can be an arbitrary number independent of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the scalar product of hsh ( [ eq : gf - s1 ] ) expresses as @xmath51^ * h^j_\\epsilon ( { \\mathbf{\\hat r } } ) = a^{(d)}_j \\ , c^{d/2 - 1}_j ( { \\mathbf{\\hat r } } ' \\cdot { \\mathbf{\\hat r}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the normalization constant and @xmath53 is the @xmath15-th order gegenbauer polynomial .",
    "the main idea is based on the fact that the scalar product @xmath54 for `` zero - length '' vectors @xmath55 ( i.e. for @xmath56 ) satisfies the laplace equation .",
    "the proof is very simple , @xmath57 the condition @xmath56 means that some components of the zero - length vector @xmath55 must be complex numbers .",
    "let us choose the components of @xmath55 to be @xmath58 where @xmath10 is the dimensionality of @xmath55 and @xmath32 .",
    "the _ real _ unit vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 have dimensionalities @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that the zero - length condition is met @xmath63 let us parametrize the @xmath10-dimensional radius - vector @xmath32 as @xmath64 it is more convenient to work with unit vectors so that @xmath65 where @xmath66 $ ] and the hyper - radius is defined by @xmath67 . note that the above parametrization implies that both @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is important to note that we are not making any assumptions about the parametrization of the unit vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that explicit expressions for hsh with the dimensionalities @xmath61 , @xmath72 are known .",
    "then , one can obtain an expression for the @xmath10-dimensional hsh as the product of known hsh with some weight function .",
