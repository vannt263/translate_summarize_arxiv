    "the diamagnetic meissner effect is one of the hallmarks of superconductivity , where applied magnetic field is ideally screened out of the superconductor when cooled below the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "however , many field - cooled experiments on various materials over the past two decades detected a paramagnetic response , i.e. _ enhanced _ magnetic field inside the sample , usually referred to as paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) or wohlleben effect .",
    "the materials in question range from elementary ones such as nb @xcite , to much more complex high-@xmath0 cuprates @xcite .",
    "one proposed explanation for the enigmatic origin of pme in cuprates is based on the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the order parameter and the idea that @xmath2 junctions formed due to josephson coupling between grain boundaries can result in spontaneous current loops with significant magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "a much simpler and more general explanation is the compression and trapping of magnetic flux on cooling . using this picture , koshelev and",
    "larkin @xcite calculated the magnitude of pme in thin stripes of conventional superconductors , and concluded that its theoretical maximum is @xmath3 of the full meissner response for the given magnetic field .",
    "@xcite performed a supporting experiment on bulk nb , and further concluded that polishing the sample surfaces strongly alters the pme , i.e. that surface barriers for flux entry and exit play an important role .",
    "the appearance of pme due to flux compression is easiest to understand in the case of mesoscopic samples , where the influence of confining boundaries is crucial .",
    "there , in analogy to surface superconductivity , during field - cooling the superconducting order parameter nucleates at the sample surface , and traps a multiquanta ( giant ) vortex inside the sample .",
    "such large and compressed flux may lead to paramagnetic response , as first predicted by moshchalkov _",
    "_ using self - consistent ginzburg - landau simulations @xcite , and subsequently verified experimentally by geim _",
    "a simple consideration shows that the paramagnetic moment strongly depends on the sample thickness , so that in very thick samples it appears only at very large fields and scales with penetration depth @xmath4 over lateral size of the sample , while in thin plates it can be significant and scales with @xmath4 over thickness @xcite .",
    "therefore , the enigmatic pme in high - temperature superconductors becomes intrinsic for thin mesoscopic conventional superconductors .",
    "recent years have seen the rise of interest in _ multiband superconductivity _",
    ", particularly since its discovery in mgb@xmath5 and in iron - based materials @xcite .",
    "the former has the highest @xmath0 of intermetallics ; the latter are layered and high - temperature superconductors .",
    "to date , there have been no investigations of the paramagnetic response in these materials . instead",
    ", a lot of attention has been paid to their rich vortex matter @xcite , and their possible classification outside the type - i / type - ii dichotomy @xcite due to observed non - monotonic vortex interaction @xcite .",
    "early works on single - band superconductors already discussed the broad crossover between conventional types of superconductivity @xcite , where abrikosov vortices exhibit long range attraction and penetration of vortices manifests as a large magnetization jump from the meissner state to the mixed state ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the lower bound of the crossover is given by the @xmath6 line in the parametric space ( @xmath7 being the thermodynamic critical field and @xmath8 the upper critical field ) @xcite , below which textbook type - i behavior takes place ( for @xmath9 only meissner state is thermodynamically stable , unless mesoscopic effects are strong , see ref .",
    "the disappearance of the long - range vortex attraction marks the end of the crossover domain , and conventional type - ii behavior is recovered .",
    "this picture was recently detailed and extended to the multiband case in ref .",
    "it is clear that non - monotonic vortex interaction and other interplay effects between condensates in multiband superconductors are bound to also affect the interactions of trapped magnetic flux with the sample boundaries , and can lead to novel manifestations of the paramagnetic meissner response . to reveal , quantify and explain the latter is the core objective of the present report .",
    "we consider a larger than mesoscopic two - band superconducting slab of width @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 for the considered parameters ) in a parallel magnetic field ( see fig . [ scheme ] ) , and report particular behavior of the sample magnetization as a function of the applied field [ m(h ) loops ] .",
    "we primarily focus on two - band materials , but our findings can be qualitatively extrapolated to systems with more than two bands . the calculations are performed within the two - component ginzburg - landau ( tcgl ) theory ( see methods ) , where we have cautiously set a sufficiently high temperature @xmath14 to ensure the qualitative and quantitative validity of our predictions in the context of recent debates @xcite , and we used full microscopic expressions of all coefficients in the theory @xcite .",
    "tcgl theory then comprises eight independent parameters , namely , the fermi velocities of the bands @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the elements of the coupling matrix @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the total density of states @xmath20 as well as the partial density of states of the first band @xmath21 ( note @xmath22 ) , and finally @xmath23 , which sets the energy scale @xmath24 . by fixing the unit of length @xmath25 and normalizing the order parameters by @xmath26 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath0 are fixed , and we are left with six parameters in the model : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 . instead of choosing @xmath20 , we opt to show the gl parameter of the first ( stronger ) band - condensate @xmath29 , which is an indicator for the expected magnetic behavior of the sample .",
    ", very long in other dimensions ( indicated by dashed lines ) , in parallel magnetic field @xmath30 . ]",
    "in what follows , we consider an infinitely thick slab of width @xmath31 , and use periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction ( with size of the unit cell @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we take for the remaining microscopic parameters of the sample : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that such choice of parameters does not correspond to any particular material , and is actually by no means unique - since our main study will concern the dependence of the magnetic properties on the ratio of the fermi velocities @xmath28 and temperature .",
    "we demonstrate these properties via calculated magnetization [ @xmath38 loops while adiabatically sweeping the magnetic field up and down .",
    "loops at @xmath39 , for sequentially increased ratio of the fermi velocities @xmath28 ( and other parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath33 ) , obtained by sweeping up and down the external magnetic field @xmath30 ( given in units of the thermodynamic critical field @xmath7 ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ mag - loop ] we show the @xmath40 loops at @xmath39 , for different values of @xmath28 . by increasing the latter parameter",
    ", we are actually decreasing the characteristic length scale of the second condensate @xmath41 ( since @xmath25 is fixed as the unit of distance ) and we are thereby driving the system into the type - ii magnetic behavior ( since @xmath42 and the gl parameter of the coupled system @xmath43 @xcite are increasing ; for calculation of the penetration depth @xmath4 , please see ref . ) .",
    "this directly manifests in magnetization curves : for low @xmath44 one easily recognizes typical response of a type - i slab ( see fig . [ mag - loop](a ) ) , with superheated meissner state in increasing field ( with subsequent collapse to normal state ) , and supercooling in decreasing field @xcite , with some flux trapping present ; for high @xmath45 , the expected response of a type - ii slab is recovered @xcite , still with some paramagnetic flux trapping ( see fig .",
    "[ mag - loop](c ) ) .",
    "however , at intermediate values of @xmath28 _ a uniquely different shape of the magnetization loop is found _",
    ", with a pronounced jump from the meissner state to the mixed state with increasing field , and a very pronounced paramagnetic response in decreasing field ( see fig .",
    "[ mag - loop](b ) ) .",
    "in increasing field , all calculated magnetization loops exhibit a superheated meissner state above the thermodynamic critical field @xmath7 , where the superheating field @xmath46 agrees very well with the seminal calculations of matricon and saint james for @xmath47 of single - band materials @xcite . at @xmath48 ,",
    "superconductivity is either destroyed ( for @xmath49 ) or a jump to the mixed state occurs ( for @xmath50 ) .",
    "the delimiting value of @xmath51 exactly satisfies the condition @xmath52 . in decreasing magnetic field , the superconductivity nucleates at the surface superconductivity field @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the nucleated states were only superconducting at the surfaces of the slab , with a large normal domain in the interior of the slab .",
    "for further lowered field and @xmath49 the normal domain remains trapped until abruptly expelled from the sample at the expulsion field @xmath54 .",
    "this analysis confirms that magnetic response of the system for @xmath49 is the one of type - i superconductors , since typical superheating - supercooling picture holds there , @xmath8 is smaller than @xmath7 , and no vortices are found in the paramagnetic branch where flux was trapped upon nucleation of surface superconductivity . however , while decreasing field for @xmath50 , where consequently @xmath55 , the normal domain becomes unstable at field @xmath56 but is not expelled ; instead , it spreads into a vortex configuration , stable down to persistently lower expulsion field @xmath54 as @xmath28 is increased .",
    "simultaneously , flux trapping becomes notably more efficient , so that the vortex exit is hampered in decreasing field and paramagnetic response increases to its maximum at @xmath54 .",
    "this tendency continues up to @xmath57 , for which paramagnetic response is almost an order of magnitude larger than the meissner response at @xmath58 , and approximately 30 times larger than the largest theoretical estimate of paramagnetic response to date ( scaled to the diamagnetic response at a given field , see ref .",
    "we therefore refer to this property as _ giant paramagnetic response _",
    "( gpr ) . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the cumulative paramagnetic response is still very large but gradually decreases , and magnetization curves in decreasing field connect to zero without any abrupt flux expulsion . in other words ,",
    "we approach the type - ii limit , in which magnetization is expected to hover around zero for descending field in the presence of surface barriers @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ parresp ] , we summarize the observed maximal amplitude , @xmath60 in the entire field range , and the total cumulative paramagnetic response , @xmath61 , as a function of @xmath28 , extracted from fig . [ mag - loop ] .    based on fig .",
    "[ parresp ] , we argue that the giant paramagnetic response is characteristic for superconductors between conventional type - i and type - ii @xcite .",
    "namely , this pronounced paramagnetic response is exactly found for sample parameters between the line @xmath6 and the line where long - range vortex interaction changes sign ( determined by effective gl parameter @xmath62 calculated after ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with a maximum found close to the parametric line where surface energy ( @xmath63 ) of the superconductor - normal metal ( s - n ) interface changes sign ( determining the change in the polarity of the short - range vortex interaction @xcite ) . for the microscopic parameters considered here , we show this domain in fig .",

    "[ critdom](b ) , for fixed @xmath64 and varied temperature indicated by yellow arrow in fig .",
    "[ critdom](a ) . from fig .",
    "[ critdom](b ) , we confirmed exactly the same behavior of the loops and relationship of the giant paramagnetic response ( gpr ) with the delimiting lines of the critical domain : for @xmath65 the expected response of a type - ii slab is found , for @xmath66 the paramagnetic response in decreasing field increases when crossing the long - range vortex attraction line , and finally a pronounced paramagnetic response followed by a jump to the meissner state is observed when crossing the @xmath67 line .",
    "besides being useful for reaffirming our conclusions , this temperature dependence of the gpr can also be directly verifiable experimentally . here",
    ", the considered samples are ideally clean , but even in realistic samples where flux trapping is present even at zero field , the rise and fall of gpr as a function of temperature will be easily observable in the above discussed scenario . note that in general , changing any of the parameters can drive the _ in silico _ material across the crossover between the types of superconductivity , and thereby change the paramagnetic response .",
    "gpr is only sensitive on the regime of superconductivity the material is in , i.e. , where the taken parameter set lies in the reconstructed fig .",

    "distinct changes in @xmath40 loops are found when either curve in panel ( a ) is crossed . ]",
    "what is the underlying mechanism for the giant paramagnetic response ? in simple terms , it is the facilitated trapping of magnetic flux in the crossover domain between type - i and type - ii superconductivity , since vortices attract in the entire range of parameters where gpr is observed .",
    "however , gpr is found to be particularly large for @xmath70 , where vortex - vortex interaction is purely attractive and vortices should coalesce into larger normal domains . on the contrary , we observe that in decreasing field separate vortex cores are still visible , though strongly overlapping ( see inset in fig . [ vortices ] ) . to clarify the dense vortex packing observed in fig .",
    "[ vortices ] , we calculate the multibody vortex - vortex interaction shown for several vortex clusters in fig .",
    "[ vortint ] . as a major surprise",
    ", we found that in this regime multibody vortex interactions become short - range repulsive and cause the formation of a vortex lattice .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vortint](a ) ( for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 ) , where we show the calculated vortex - vortex interaction as a function of the distance between vortices ( labelled d ) , for a vortex pair , a vortex trimer , a vortex diamond - like cluster and a hexagonal vortex cluster .",
    "the pairwise vortex interaction is purely attractive , as expected , but in the other cases the short - range repulsion arises so that energetically favorable vortex - vortex distance arises in mid - range ( note that this favorable distance closely corresponds to the average vortex distance observed in fig .",
    "[ vortices](b ) ) .",
    "an insight into the physics of this short - range repulsive interaction can be achieved by analysing the superconducting state inside , for example , the hexagonal vortex cluster shown in fig [ vortint ] . with this aim ,",
    "we computed the maximum of the cooper - pair density , @xmath74 , inside that cluster for each band - condensate separately , shown as a function of vortex distance @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ vortint](b ) .",
    "we reveal that the cooper - pair density in the second condensate vanishes inside the vortex cluster at the vortex distance where short - range repulsion arises . hence we can conclude that inside the vortex cluster the physics is driven by the other condensate , which has type - ii character , hence the repulsive interaction of vortices prevails at short distances .",
    "it is known that multibody vortex interactions are more complex than a simple superposition of pairwise interactions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but it has never been found before that multibody interactions can change the polarity of the vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "this is a key feature of the found mixed state for parameters of the system between @xmath67 and @xmath6 lines in fig .",
    "[ critdom ] .",
    "in addition , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ vortices](a ) the number of vortices in the sample @xmath75 as a function of @xmath30 in the downward branch of @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ mag - loop ] for @xmath76 ( in the type - ii limit ) and @xmath71 ( inside the crossover region ) .",
    "the high retention of flux is clearly seen as a nonlinear behavior for @xmath71 which contrasts the type - ii case in which @xmath75 is linearly decreasing towards the origin .",
    "we find that although the number of vortices in the states between @xmath77 and @xmath78 lines slowly decreases with decreasing magnetic field , their favorable distance is approximately independent of field [ see fig .",
    "[ vortices](b ) ] .",
    "this unconventional vortex state allows the penetration of the magnetic field in larger portions of the sample ( inhomogeneous penetration , within but also between vortices ) , and clearly traps more flux than an ordinary vortex lattice , down to very low field - resulting in a more pronounced gpr . due to the interlocking of vortices in this regime",
    ", the barrier for the expulsion of the entire vortex cluster in decreasing field corresponds to the bean - livingston barrier for a single vortex , which we confirmed by an independent calculation .",
    "notice that as soon as the s - n surface energy changes sign , the barrier for single - vortex expulsion becomes nonzero at all fields .",
    "however , we have the simultaneous appearance of short - range vortex repulsion , which in effect diminishes the bean - livingston barrier and vortices are gradually expelled from the sample depending on their density and applied magnetic field .",
    "this manifests in the magnetization curves as a gradual decrease of the paramagnetic effect in decreasing field , down to zero for zero field . as the @xmath28 ratio or temperature",

    "we showed that such unique magnetic response occurs in the crossover region between conventional types of superconductivity , and is not captured by the standard textbook descriptions . on technological end ,",

    "<S> superconductors , ideally diamagnetic when in the meissner state , can also exhibit paramagnetic behavior due to trapped magnetic flux . in the absence of pinning </S>",
    "<S> such paramagnetic response is weak , and ceases with increasing sample thickness . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that in multiband superconductors paramagnetic response can be observed even in slab geometries , and can be far larger than any previous estimate - even multiply larger than the diamagnetic meissner response for the same applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we link the appearance of this _ giant paramagnetic response _ to the broad crossover between conventional type - i and type - ii superconductors , where abrikosov vortices interact non - monotonically and multibody effects become important , causing unique flux configurations and their locking in the presence of surfaces . </S>"
