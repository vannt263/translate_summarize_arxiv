    "it remains notoriously difficult to understand the low - energy regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in terms of the simplistic but otherwise successful constituent quark picture . in line with the formulation of feynman s parton model @xcite in the infinite momentum frame @xcite",
    ", a promising approach could be that of pauli and brodsky @xcite which adapts dirac s ` front form ' hamiltonian dynamics @xcite for nonperturbative quantum field theory .",
    "perhaps a misnomer , the method carries the name discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) .",
    "numerous applications have been carried out with reasonable success in extracting bound state spectra and wavefunctions for both ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions in abelian @xcite and non - abelian gauge theories @xcite as well as for higher space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "dlcq combines the aspects of a simple vacuum @xcite with a careful treatment of the infrared degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter are controlled by the finite volume regularization of the method .",
    "there is legitimate hope that one can thus get both a manageable treatment of the ` vacuum problem ' and explicit invariant mass spectra and wavefunctions for physical particles .    in this paper",
    "we concern ourselves with more than just the vacuum problem , which in this context manifests itself as the so - called ` zero mode problem ' .",
    "contrary to the original expectations of the framers of dlcq , the zero momentum modes of the lagrangian field operators have proved far more than just a `` set of measure zero '' .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath0 theory in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions they are crucial in reproducing the vacuum properties of the theory , namely spontaneous symmetry breaking and a vacuum condensate @xcite .",
    "this is achieved in the dlcq framework by the property of the zero mode of @xmath1 being , not dynamical , but satisfying a constraint @xcite .",
    "this preserves the simplicity of the vacuum and thus the partonic picture of light - cone field theory .",
    "the desired symmetry is _ explicitly _ broken upon solution of the constraint by non - perturbative approximation and substitution in the hamiltonian @xcite . now",
    "the four - point coupling of _ gluons _ suggests at least some aspect of this feature will be present in qcd(3 + 1 ) .",
    "we thus set out in the sequence of papers @xcite to _ disentangle _ the constraint problem from that of the gauge - symmetry of the non - abelian theory .",
    "constrained zero modes occur even in abelian theory @xcite for which one requires gauge - fixing to solve @xcite and that gauge choice may _ not _ in general be that on the non - zero modes . but not all zero modes in a gauge theory are constrained .",
    "less significant in qed(3 + 1 ) , some of these dynamical modes are intimately related to the non - trivial topology of both the hyper - torus implicit in dlcq and become important in the presence of non - abelian gauge groups @xcite .",
    "we thus find a diverse range of zero mode types , all of which will evidently be present in qcd(3 + 1 ) . treating these types _ together _ in a single theory , albeit a still simplified one ,",
    "is the subject of this paper .",
    "the essential principle we shall use for getting to simpler theories from qcd(3 + 1 ) was espoused in @xcite .",
    "lower dimensional ` regimes ' of a higher dimensional theory can be systematically explored because of the finite volume regularization : zero and non - zero momentum modes can be cleanly distinguished and so one can , for example , excite one and not the other .",
    "one thus obtains effective theories in lower space - time dimensions that are not identical to the original theory defined _ a priori _ in lower dimensions .",
    "this is essentially ` dimensional reduction ' @xcite .",
    "a similar idea for the instant form was recently suggested by @xcite . in @xcite we examined ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional pure su(2 ) gauge theory coupled to external sources in dlcq .",
    "we suppressed _ all _ momentum excitations and obtained a ( 0 + 1 ) dimensional  quantum mechanical  theory of a single gluon zero mode whose dynamics depended on external sources coupled to the gluons .",
    "this mode corresponds to the quantized flux loop around the circle defining space .",
    "the mode is purely of topological origin , and thus the theory was manifestly isomorphic to a quantization in the instant form defined on the analogous topology @xcite .",
    "this is one of the types of zero modes discussed above .",
    "the ` next step ' , taken in this paper , is to begin with ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional su(2 ) theory and looking at the nested ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional theory by suppressing transverse gluon momentum excitations .",
    "the topological mode appears here again , but now coupled to true dynamical field modes that are the fock modes of the transverse gluon component .",
    "as well , other types of zero modes appear .",
    "this is now the simplest type of non - abelian gauge theory we can construct in which all the types of zero modes encountered previously couple together into a nontrivial dynamical problem .",
    "many of the structures we unveil here were already foreseen in 1981 by franke et al .",
    "@xcite in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "it will become clear in the course of the present work that these types of models , first discussed in dlcq by @xcite but without zero modes and assuming only color singlet string states , enable insight into how to overcome the obstacles that impeded franke .",
    "the aim of this work then is two - fold .",
    "the first is a formal aim : to show how a treatment of the non - abelian gauge theory can be achieved which keeps the advantages of the front - form approach while controlling the infrared problem .",
    "this we succeed in doing insofar as we can give a hamiltonian in which the nature of all modes  zero and non - zero  is clarified and their means of solution at least understood .",
    "sections 2 to 4 deal with these formal aspects . in particular , in section 3 we make the restriction in the gauge fixing to the so - called ` fundamental modular domain ' @xcite .",
    "the second aim is to gain insight into the physical spectrum of the aforementioned hamiltonian of the pure glue theory by at least semi - analytic methods .",
    "here we relax rigour and make several simplifying assumptions within the context of a cutoff regularization of the large momentum region of the theory .",
    "a point - splitting treatment will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "several insights into the spectrum are obtained .",
    "the purely contraction parts of the hamiltonian lead to the potential for the schrdinger equation in the gauge zero mode sector .",
    "this is the analogue for the problem we solved in @xcite .",
    "two alternative methods are described for dealing with the singular structure of the potential , either keeping the cutoff or ` renormalizing ' the potential . in both scenarios",
    ", we are able to simultaneously diagonalize the energy and momentum operators .",
    "this is discussed in section 5 . however , in the absence of a definite counterterm for the renormalization approach we use the solution to the gauge zero mode keeping the cutoff and implement it in the particle sector of the theory .",
    "we give a color singlet state which is an eigenstate to part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the invariant mass squared of this state is seen to diverge when all cutoffs are taken to their physical values .",
    "we comment on this in the discussion .",
    "consider an su(n ) gauge theory without fermions in @xmath2 dimensions defined by the lagrangian density @xmath3 \\",
    "\\equiv \\partial^\\mu   { \\bf a}^\\nu    - { \\bf d}^\\nu   { \\bf a}^\\mu \\ . \\label{lagr}\\ ] ] the @xmath4 are the su(n ) _ vector potentials_. we shall reserve the term ` gauge potential ' for something else , discussed below .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is derived from eq.([lagr ] ) in the usual way @xcite by @xmath5 .",
    "this and the notation are explained in more detail in appendix [ sec : notapp ] .",
    "but at this stage we keep the discussion general for su(n ) for arbitrary number of colors @xmath6 . in the _ front form _ , it is convenient to separate the lorentz indices @xmath7 into _ longitudinal _ values @xmath8 and _ transversal _ values @xmath9 .",
    "the indicial sums in the lagrangian and the ( light - cone ) energy - density @xmath10 then disentangle cleanly , @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the dimensionality of the problem is not manifest but resides in the dimensions of the fields .",
    "working in dimensions of length @xmath12 , we have for the field and coupling the usual @xmath13 \\equiv l^{(1-d)/2}$ ] and @xmath14 \\equiv l^{(d-3)/2}$ ] .",
    "the energy - density in ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has the simple structure @xmath15 as in previous work @xcite it is convenient to disentangle such an expression into ` zero modes ' and ` normal modes ' .",
    "a _ zero mode _ of some function @xmath16 with respect to any one of the space coordinates , say @xmath17 with interval length @xmath18 , is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the remaining spatial coordinates not being integrated over .",
    "when @xmath17 is the longitudinal direction @xmath21 we shall denote the zero mode by @xmath22 .",
    "the _ normal mode _ is , in general , the complement @xmath23 .",
    "we see then that since @xmath24 involves an integration of the density with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath25 , it is like evaluating the transversal ` zero mode ' of the energy density .",
    "taking the zero mode with respect to any space - like coordinate , one realizes that the hamiltonian is _ additive _ in the zero and normal mode contributions , _",
    "i.e._@xmath26 of course one should not take this too far , since zero and normal modes of the individual quantum fields can ( and do ) reside in both terms of this expression",
    ". however the separation allows for a conceptual simplification : by lack of insight , the original formulation of discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) was formulated in terms of _ only _ the normal modes",
    ". it should be useful and even complementary to analyze the theory in terms of only the transversal zero modes .",
    "we therefore consider a model which only has _",
    "transversal zero modes _ by requiring @xmath27 this is to be regarded as a genuine dynamical restriction on the full theory .",
    "of course this theory will now involve both zero and normal mode longitudinal gluon excitations . since the lengths @xmath28 and @xmath29 are now decoupled in scale , it is convenient to readjust units by scaling out the transverse length @xmath28 , @xmath30 in the sequel the tilde is dropped .",
    "the dimensionality resides then only in the lorentz indices . for simplicity",
    "we now restrict ourselves to consider the original theory has having beeen formulated in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the result of the assumption eq.([restrict ] ) is to have _ dimensionally reduced _ the ( 2 + 1 ) theory to ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "however a reminder of the original ( 2 + 1 ) structure resides in the continued presence of the transverse gluon component @xmath31 . in the spirit of siegel @xcite , who introduced dimensional reduction for regularizing supersymmetric theories",
    ", we identify this gluon as a _ scalar _",
    "field @xmath32 transforming under the adjoint representation of the color group . to completely avoid playing with lorentz indices we go further and introduce",
    "the notation @xmath33 the model - theory then takes the form of a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional non - abelian gauge theory covariantly coupled to scalar adjoint matter @xmath34 the covariant derivative @xmath35 is implicitly defined in eq.([lagr ] ) .",
    "a similar treatment of this theory in dlcq was recently given by @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion in the two parts of the theory can be deduced from the sourceless color maxwell equations and are @xmath36   \\ , \\quad\\   { \\rm and } \\quad     { \\bf d}^\\alpha   { \\bf d}_\\alpha \\phi   = 0 \\ .",

    "we follow the procedure given in @xcite and find that @xmath40 only has a zero mode , i.e. @xmath41 . at this point we specialize to su(2 ) .",
    "then a single rotation in color space suffices to diagonalize the su(2 ) color matrix @xmath42 .",
    "the simple way to see this mode can not be gauged away is that it is related to the wilson loop for a contour ( line ) along the @xmath43 space : a gauge invariant quantity that can not be set to a fixed value by gauge choice . there",
    "remain a set of ` large ' gauge transformations which generate shifts in @xmath44 known as gribov copies @xcite .",
    "these matters are discussed further later and in appendix [ sec : gribfock ] . in the instant form",
    "this gauge has been used by a range of authors , @xcite to list a few . in a context related to the front form",
    "it has also been used by @xcite .",
    "finally , the diagonal zero mode of @xmath45 can be gauged away @xcite at some fixed light - cone time @xmath46 . for writing the hamiltonian later , it is convenient to choose this time as @xmath47 , the null - plane initial value surface on which we specify the independent fields .    in this gauge",
    "then , @xmath48 .",
    "the first of our three equations of motion , @xmath49 , is simply gauss law , @xmath50 , realized here as a _",
    "second class _ constraint in the nomenclature of dirac @xcite . in the absence of gauge - fixing",
    "these are first class constraints .",
    "they are a consequence of , and generate , gauge - symmetry . with the gauge - fixing , these can be realized as quantum operator constraints with an exception which we discuss below .",
    "this aside , we can be cavalier and solve this equation strongly yielding @xmath51 the exception is a remnant first class constraint , namely the zero mode diagonal part of gauss law .",
    "the reason for this is that in selecting out the color - three direction we have factored the group so(2)@xmath52so(2 ) from su(2 ) ( locally isomorphic to so(3 ) ) , leaving a subgroup of so(2 ) rotations which leave the preferred axis invariant .",
    "this itself is isomorphic to u(1 ) . in other words",
    "we have a residual symmetry with respect to global abelian gauge transformations .",
    "it means in the quantum theory there are redundant states in the hilbert space corresponding to the `` fibres '' or `` orbits '' in gauge configuration space .",
    "unique representatives on these orbits must be selected by projecting a ` reduced hilbert space ' out of the larger space by requiring the selected , so - called ` physical ' @xcite , state vectors have vanishing ` charge ' @xmath53 .",
    "the charge here is the zero mode of the matter density @xmath54 . though this does not necessarily imply that @xmath55 is an actual state in the physical _ spectrum _ , states outside this subspace render the theory _ a priori _ inconsistent .",
    "analogous constraints can be found in many other contexts , for example in @xcite .",

    "this is simply achieved by replacing , in the above hamiltonian , the currents @xmath172 with the operators @xmath146 via the definition ( [ defcharge ] ) . inspecting the expressions for @xmath146 given in appendix [ sec :",
    "charges ] one observes they all annihilate the fock vacuum @xmath173 , while @xmath174 .",
    "so the full hamiltonian has a vev , henceforward denoted by @xmath175 . since it depends on the _ quantum operator _",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath176 can not be removed by the usual trivial vacuum renormalization .",
    "rather the vev plays the role of a ` potential energy ' in what we call the ` gauge part ' of the hamiltonian which also includes the kinetic term for @xmath83 , namely @xmath177 we extract the expression for @xmath175 by bringing the hamiltonian to normal ordered form . commuting the operators @xmath178 with @xmath146 in the substitute of eq.([hamall ] ) leaves us with the contribution @xmath179 to the fock space part of the hamiltonian @xmath180 , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath181 the vev of the left - over commutator term generates the gauge mode potential @xmath182 \\vert 0\\rangle     + \\sum_{k = { 1\\over2}}^{\\infty }        v_k^4\\ \\langle 0 \\vert \\bigl [ q_+ ( k ) ,                          q_+^\\dagger ( k ) \\bigr ] \\vert 0\\rangle     + \\sum_{k = { 1\\over2}}^{\\infty }        u_k^4\\ \\langle 0 \\vert \\bigl [ q_- ( k ) ,                          q_-^\\dagger ( k ) \\bigr ] \\vert 0\\rangle       . \\label{gaugepoteq}\\ ] ] this is analyzed in detail in appendix [ sec : gaugepot ] and represented in fig.1 .",
    "subtracting eq.([gaugepoteq ] ) from the commutator expression gives the other contribution to the fock - space hamiltonian : @xmath183       + \\sum_{k = { 1\\over2}}^{\\infty }          v_k^4\\ \\bigl [ q_+ ( k ) , q_+^\\dagger ( k ) \\bigr ]       + \\sum_{k = { 1\\over2}}^{\\infty }          u_k^4\\ \\bigl [ q_- ( k ) , q_-^\\dagger ( k ) \\bigr ]      - v_0 ( z )     \\ .\\ ] ] thus far it would appear to suffice to consider the @xmath146 operators and @xmath83 for the determination of the spectrum .",
    "this changes if one addresses the constrained mode @xmath145 as the constraint can not be expressed purely in terms of @xmath184 operators . from eq.([hamall ] ) and ( [ defcharge ] ) , one finds @xmath145 makes its appearance in the hamiltonian both linearly and quadratically which we separate into @xmath185 .",

    "there are two possibilities where such nonvanishing contributions could arise .",
    "the first is when an @xmath145 appears either to the extreme left or extreme right in @xmath188 .",
    "however , preliminary studies of the structure of the constraint suggest that no non - zero vev of @xmath145 or @xmath189 can arise .",
    "thus , the role played by this mode is quite different from that of its counterpart in the @xmath190 theory .",
    "the second possibility of non - zero contribution to the gauge potential is when the zero mode lies between an annihilation operator on the left and a creation operator on the right , such as @xmath191 .",
    "a nonzero vev could potentially arise from such contributions if @xmath192 $ ] and @xmath193 $ ] are non - zero .",
    "this completes the analysis of the light - cone hamiltonian . in summary",
    "though , we have reexpressed the hamiltonian as a sum of three contributions , _",
    "i.e._@xmath194 in the next section we will see how far analytic methods can take us in diagonalizing parts of the hamiltonian .    finally , we should emphasize that we have refrained thus far from _ ad hoc _ approximations to define a consistent hamiltonian and hilbert space .",
    "as we are unable to give here exact analytical solutions we consider their numerical simulation as a challenge for the future . in the sequel",
    "we therefore will continue with several simplifying assumptions which will allow us to solve part of the hamiltonian analytically .",
    "the most drastic among them is the omission of the constraint part .",
    "we thus will concentrate efforts in the following on solving approximately @xmath195 and @xmath196 subject to the omission of @xmath188 .",
    "the potential energy @xmath175 which appears in @xmath195 via eq.([gaugepot ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath197 , is what we shall loosely refer to as the ` gauge potential ' . as analyzed in appendix [ sec : gaugepot ] it is _ invariant _ under large gauge transformations .",
    "one therefore can restrict oneself to calculate it only for the fundamental modular domain @xmath82 .",
    "in fig.1 it is displayed for the two cases explained below . in either case , because of the singular behaviour at @xmath198 and @xmath199 , there will be a discrete spectrum of excitation energies in this potential .",
    "these will be labelled by a quantum number @xmath6 . generalizing the representation in",
    "@xcite we use a wavefunctions @xmath200 so that we address ourselves to solving the schrdinger equation @xmath201 the symbol @xmath202 will be reserved for the vacuum normalized eigen - energy , namely @xmath203 .    in the fundamental modular domain",
    "the potential is symmetric about @xmath204 . as mentioned , it is singular at @xmath198 and @xmath205 .",
    "it has a minimum at @xmath204 , however the value of the function there is actually divergent .",
    "moreover its curvature diverges at that point , that is @xmath206 , @xmath207 , where @xmath140 is the value of a dimensionless regulator truncating sums .",
    "the precise meaning of this divergent behaviour , namely whether it is physical or formal , is unclear to us . lacking a definite answer",
    ", we pursue below the two alternative scenarios , labelled ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "let us take the point of view that the divergent @xmath208 behaviour of the potential should be cancelled by a counterterm in the lagrangian .",
    "in fact we do not know what this counterterm should be and the answer may come from the , as yet unavailable , solution to the constrained zero mode @xmath209 .",
    "we therefore proceed by simply numerically subtracting the function @xmath210 from the explicit expression in appendix [ sec : gaugepot ] .",
    "we plot the so - obtained function in fig.1 . upon inspection ,",
    "one notes the very flat base in the vicinity of @xmath211 . a good approximation might therefore be the infinite square well . restoring units ,",
    "the problem is expressed by @xmath212 .",
    "after a vacuum energy subtraction , the eigen - energy _ densities _ @xmath213 are @xmath214 .",
    "we thus recover the spectrum for su(2 ) pure zero mode glue in 1 + 1 dimensions as obtained in @xcite , and verified by us on the light - cone in @xcite .",
    "wavefunctions respecting boundary conditions are then @xmath215 up to normalization . as for subtleties concerning this choice over the cosine",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "thus we have succeeded in diagonalizing the gauge part of @xmath24 . as the vacuum part of @xmath216",
    "has no dependence on @xmath217 these wavefunctions are also eigenfunctions of @xmath216 with momentum zero .    for reasonably large values of the cutoff @xmath140 , the @xmath208 term dominates , as mentioned , over the @xmath140-independent part and thus here the latter can be omitted .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ sec : gaugepot ] , with the cutoff finite but large the gauge potential can be approximated by @xmath218 the numerical value of @xmath219 is given in appendix [ sec : gaugepot ] , while @xmath220 is an unspecified constant .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are now those of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath221 respectively , where the @xmath222 are the hermite polynomials of order @xmath6 , and where the @xmath223 normalize all eigenfunctions to unity .",
    "the state with lowest energy has @xmath224 , by inspection , and has to be identified with the true ` vacuum ' .",
    "the vacuum - renormalized eigenvalues and lowest energy eigenfunctions are thus @xmath225 in the limit @xmath226 the eigenfunctions degenerate into , roughly speaking , @xmath227-`functions ' , namely the wavefunctions strongly localize about @xmath204 .",
    "this extremely sharp peaking implies that the _ operator _ @xmath83 can be replaced by the _ number _",
    "@xmath228 everywhere but in the gauge hamiltonian , a significant simplification .",
    "it is what makes this scenario radically different from the former . as a consequence , the gauge excitations @xmath229 , the `` gaugeons '' , have for finite but sufficiently large @xmath140 a finite and non - degenerate ( light - cone ) energy but strictly zero mass .",
    "in the remainder we address ourselves to finding eigenstates to @xmath230 . in the absence of a complete picture for the renormalization in scenario (",
    "a ) , we implement here the conclusions of scenario ( b ) for the gauge mode : we substitute @xmath204 where appropriate",
    ". the hilbert space will be spanned by the product states of gauge eigenfunctions @xmath229 and ` fock states ' .",
    "the product states @xmath231 are what we loosely call _ pseudovacua_. the true vacuum is @xmath232 . on top of it",
    "we now build fock space excitations .    let us consider three types of two - particle fock - space excitations , the toy states @xmath233 to which we shall refer collectively as @xmath234 .",
    "we mention already here that only one of these , @xmath235 , satisfies gauss law . using the approximate delta - function behaviour of the gauge wavefunctions ,",
    "the toy states are seen to be eigenstates of @xmath66 _ i.e. _ @xmath236 are they also eigenstates to the full @xmath24 ?    in general , the commutators of charge operators @xmath237 acting on the vacuum can be separated into c - number and operator parts @xmath238 | { 0 } >     = ( \\delta_{ab }   s_a(k ) \\delta^k_p     + { \\cal o}_{ab}(p , k ) ) | { 0 } > \\ , \\label { modelcomm}\\ ] ] with the c - number coefficients @xmath239 defined in appendix [ sec : gaugepot ] .",
    "the operator part @xmath240 is complicated to write down in full and is generally non - zero .",
    "however , for @xmath241 , @xmath242 . taking this as a hint , we shall _ assume _ that the effects of @xmath243 are in some sense `` small '' and set the entire operator to zero by hand .    with these simplifications",
    "now , the commutator @xmath244 vanishes and all three toy states @xmath245 become eigenstates of @xmath179 , like for example @xmath246 | { 0 } >   + 2\\sum_{p = 1}^{\\infty }       w_p^4\\   q_3^\\dagger ( p )    \\bigl [ q_3 ( p ) , q_3 ( k)^\\dagger \\bigr ] | { 0 } > \\nonumber \\\\   & + & 2\\sum_{p = { 1\\over2}}^{\\infty }       u_p^4\\   q_-^\\dagger ( p )    \\bigl [ q_- ( p ) , q_3 ( k)^\\dagger \\bigr ] | { 0 } >    \\quad",
    "\\simeq \\quad      4 \\ln   k | { k ; 3 } > \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for sufficiently large values of @xmath166 , according to eqs.([cc3func ] ) .",
    "recall that the continuum limit is reached @xcite by the limit @xmath247 .",
    "the combined action of the energy and momentum operators @xmath248 becomes thus @xmath249 .",
    "the action of the mass - squared operator @xmath250 on the toy states gives finally , after restoring units according to eq.([transcale ] ) , @xmath251 independent of the longitudinal interval length @xmath29 .",
    "this then is an approximate mass spectrum of the model in the two - particle sector with all cutoffs large but finite .",
    "how does it behave as cutoffs are removed ?",
    "we take the necessary limits as follows .",
    "( 1 ) there is no meaning to the transversal continuum limit in the present model so we consider @xmath28 as arbitrary but fixed .",
    "( 2 ) since it is meaningful to consider physics in a finite volume or interval , @xmath140 should be taken to its physical limit before @xmath29 .",
    "this removes from the spectrum all the `` gaugeon '' excitations @xmath6 .",
    "( 3 ) as mentioned , the longitudinal continuum limit is defined by @xmath252 , but @xmath253 fixed .",
    "since the longitudinal length does not appear one has to take the isolated limit @xmath247 .",
    "thus the degenerate triplet of states with @xmath254 also diverge in the continuum limit and do not survive in the bare spectrum .",
    "let us briefly restate the approach we took here . beginning with su(2 )",
    "gauge theory in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions in the front form we suppressed transverse momenta of the gluons and obtained a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional gauge theory coupled to adjoint scalar matter .",
    "gauge fixing of this theory revealed for the content many dynamical normal modes of the scalar field , a topological gauge zero mode , and a constrained zero mode .",
    "the constrained mode satisfies a linear but nonetheless complicated operator constraint .",
    "the gauge - fixing involved a space - time independent color rotation that reduced the remnant gauss law to be implemented to an abelian global symmetry generator .",
    "we succeeded in specifying the space of states which would be annihilated by the gauss operator , namely that of color singlet states built from the fock or parton operators .",
    "not performing the gauge rotation would not even permit one to easily solve gauss law .",
    "we succeeded in diagonalizing both @xmath66 and @xmath24 in the gauge mode sector in two separate approaches which respectively involved keeping or removing an ultraviolet cutoff in the calculation . the cutoff independent approach lead to gauge mode wavefunctions",
    "that were unlocalized . with the cutoff ,",
    "the solution of the gauge mode problem in the fock space sector reduced to substituting in the fock sector the minimum value of its potential by the value @xmath255 .",
    "we approximately and analytically solved for the invariant mass of three composite states , one of which satisfied gauss law . even for this one ,",
    "the energy diverged in the continuum limit .",
    "we now interpret the meaning of this result .",
    "it might be that some aspect of the nontrivial renormalization required in full ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions manifests itself even in this ( 1 + 1)-dimensional sub - regime . while the theory is superrenormalizable by virtue of dimensionality",
    "the structure of the ( finite ) number of divergences is not of the usual two - dimensional qcd type but reflect some substructure of the higher dimensional theory and its renormalization and scaling properties . recalling that every lagrangian field theory has an open scale , only _",
    "mass ratios _ can be meaningful quantities .",
    "if our toy states reflect correctly the behaviour of the lowest energy singlet state , namely running like @xmath256 , then renormalization of the spectrum is achieved by ` renormalizing the coupling constant ' .",
    "this would then read explicitly @xmath257 leading to a lowest excitation of mass ` 1 ' in arbitrary units .",
    "we now return to the question of the diagonalization of the gauge part of the hamiltonian in scenario ( a ) .",
    "it leads to a more complicated treatment of the @xmath83-mode when including the fock space excitations .",
    "there is nothing in principle hindering a full solution of this but we leave it for future work .",
    "what remains to be understood is what type of counterterm could remove this divergence .",
    "it is possible that the omitted constrained mode contributions assist in the renormalization of the potential .",
    "we are presently exploring this in the context of fock space truncation approximations @xcite for solving the constraint .",
    "that the constrained zero mode can provide renormalization counterterms is not without precedent , for example this has already been seen in perturbative qed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the picture emerging in scenario ( b ) , of a special role for the value @xmath258 , has also been seen via point - splitting regularization of gauss law and the momentum operator .",
    "this will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "more can be done analytically : evidently some nontrivial linear combination of the @xmath259 operators could build a color singlet for which an approximate eigenvalue might be obtainable .",
    "nevertheless , the treatment of the first four sections has prepared the way for treating the theory with the full power of _ standard _ dlcq numerical techniques , now including zero modes .",
    "such numerical work is underway .",
    "going beyond the present theory would mean addressing dimensionally reduced qcd(3 + 1 ) where all the features discussed here will continue .",
