    "the ultimate aim of studying ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhic ) is not merely to establish the production of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) - by looking at various signals - but to get a complete picture of the space - time evolution of qgp . in short , one hopes to describe the evolution of this unique deconfined state of hadronic matter in all its stages - production , equilibration and hadronisation .",
    "ambitious that this might seem , it has indeed proved impossible to separate the study of signals such as @xmath0 suppression or strangeness enhancement without having an at least approximate idea of the production and evolution of qgp .",
    "we have recently proposed a mechanism @xcite for producing qgp in urhic - the soft and the semisoft quarks and gluons that constitute the bulk of the plasma .",
    "the mechanism manifests as the source term in the transport equation for the distribution functions for the partons .",
    "this source term , which is the rate at which the partons are produced in the extended phase space , has the following features : ( i ) it is defined in the two particle phase space , ( ii ) the production rate is non - markovian in time@xcite , ( iii ) the vacuum has a dynamical role to play @xcite - it acts both as a source and a sink , ( iv ) the partons are quasiparticles with a finite life time @xcite , ( v ) the rate evaluation takes into account the time scales involved in the production vis - a - vis the time intervals over which the rate is determined , ( vi ) the phase space dependence does not violate the uncertainty principle , and finally , ( vii ) the dynamical nature of the colour charge is manifest . given all these attributes , it is natural to ask whether the source term can throw light on the spatial dimensions of the qgp as it evolves in time .",
    "although a complete answer to this question has to be kept pending until the transport equation is solved in a self consistent manner , the purport of this paper is to show that the source term by itself does have interesting information .",
    "we shall illustrate this by looking at the longitudinal dimensions in a generic example .",
    "one promising observational tool for studying dynamically the spatial extension of the fireball is the measurement of hbt correlations @xcite in two and three pions ( and kaons ) that are produced in urhic . in particle physics",
    ", this idea was first proposed by goldhaber _ et .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 collisions . in the context of qgp , a major impetus for such",
    "a study is the hope that a knowledge of the system size would also settle whether the source producing the pions / kaons is nuclear , or its deconfined state . a useful tool that it is , measurements in hbt are still beset with many uncertainties - of extracting and interpreting data .",
    "much of it is due to the fact that the source here is not static ; it evolves rapidly , over time scales of several fermis and over length scales of the same order .",
    "the reconstruction of the source history from hbt observations is , therefore , not straight forward : it has been pointed out @xcite that what gets determined is not the true `` size '' of the system , but only the so called regions of `` space time homogeneity '' .",
    "the other complications are the finite life time of the source , inhomogeneous temperature profiles and a strong collective dynamical expansion @xcite . at a more basic level ,",
    "hbt studies have the best utility if the pions are produced from a chaotic source ; there is no clinching justification ( theoretically ) to assume that in the case of urhic ; studies based on the lund model @xcite indicate that the sources do possess non - chaoticity . an empirical test to check the chaoticity is to measure the so called @xmath2 parameter in two pion correlations .",
    "however , @xmath2 itself depends on other paramters which are either incompletely or inaccurately known @xcite .",
    "apart from these caveats , the extraction of radii involves additional assumptions : the interpretation and parametrisation of hbt data assume a gaussian profile for the source .",
    "reasonable and natural that it seems , it still needs justification .",
    "next , the ( spurious ) contributions from the coulomb interaction have to be subtracted .",
    "more inportantly , one needs a criterion for `` emission instant '' and the `` duration of emission of the particles '' - both of which are ill defined in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the phase space coordinates should also be sufficiently coarsened so as not to violate uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "these problems are nontrivial to handle both in experiments and theoretical simulations @xcite .",
    "an illustrative instance of the present situation is the so called rhic puzzle @xcite which is still not understood properly .    in short ,",
    "the utility of the hbt analyses gets enhanced if they can be supplemented with an independent theoretical investigation of the space time dynamics of qgp . as mentioned at the beginning",
    ", the transport studies provide the required frame work .",
    "we shall show that the the source term proposed in @xcite does indeed give valuable information on the spatial extension of qgp .",
    "the next section introduces the source term derived in @xcite and the subsequent section discusses the spatial extension of the source . for the sake of simplicity , we consider only the longitudinal dimension .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the motivation and details of deriving the source term .",
    "to summarise in a nut shell , the production of qgp takes place via the decay of a mean chromoelectric field ( cef ) that is produced in between the two nuclei soon after they have collided and start receding from each other . by energy momentum conservation ,",
    "the cef acquires a space - time dependence , thanks to which the instability of the qcd vacuum may be studied perturbatively .",
    "it may be _ emphasised _ that the existence of cef is itself a consequence of the non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "indeed , the chromoelectric field may be considered to be a manifestation of the strings in the colour flux tube model @xcite , which is known to provide a natural setting for discussing quark confinement @xcite .",
    "the main difference between this work and the conventional approaches is that the latter do not take into cognisance the space time dependence of the cef in invoking the production mechanism ; they employ schwinger mechanism @xcite which is valid only if the field is uniform and constant .",
    "we make no such assumption here ( see also @xcite in this context ) .",
    "consider the gluons .",
    "the lagrangian for pair production may be set up by expanding the gauge potential @xmath3 as a sum of the background classical potential @xmath4 and its fluctuation @xmath5 which is operator valued .",
    "keeping terms quadratic in the fluctuations in the yang -mills action , we get @xmath6+{\\cal o}(g^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking into account the wu yang ambiguity @xcite , and the studies of brown and weissberger @xcite",
    ". one can argue that @xmath4 should have an abelian form , at least for non vanishing leading order contributions . by a suitable gauge choice , we may write @xmath7 where the summation runs only over the diagonal generators of the gauge group .",
    "note that @xmath4 generates only an electric component .    in determining the production rate , as a function of time ,",
    "the crucial step is _ not _ to evaluate the s - matrix .",
    "instead , we study the time dependent evolution of the state @xmath8 in the fock space using the standard schwinger - dyson expansion for the unitary operator @xmath9 , with the boundary condition @xmath10 .",
    "the instant @xmath11 is singled out as the moment of the creation of cef .",
    "the state at any time is then projected on to the two gluon sector .",
    "the mass shell condition is imposed as a constraint on the physical states .",
    "denote the two gluon state as @xmath12 , labelled by the momentum , spin and colour quantum numbers respectively . in the leading order",
    ", the production amplitude may be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "further , @xmath15 is the incomplete fourier transform of the gauge field and @xmath16 are the energies carried by the gluons .",
    "the corresponding expression for the @xmath17 production is given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 are the generators of the gauge group in the fundamental representation , while @xmath21 are the usual dirac spinors .    the probability that a pair is produced _ any time _ during the interval @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 standing for either @xmath25 or @xmath17 . in @xcite ,",
    "rates were extracted by taking the derivative of the probability with respect to time . here ,",
    "we study the probabilities directly .    in order to extract the size parameters , we deviate from the evaluation performed in @xcite .",
    "we label the two parton states by their position coordinates @xmath26 , which entails the standard fourier traansform of eqns . 2 and 3 in the variables @xmath27 .",
    "the magnitude squared of the amplitudes now has the significance that it is the probability that a pair gets created in the interval @xmath28 , with the particles found at @xmath26 at the instant t. for our purposes we may sum over the spin , colour and one of the position coordinates .",
    "the resulting quantity @xmath29 gives the ( unnormalised ) probability density for the parton as a function of time .",
    "please note that it is _ incorrect _ to interpret @xmath30 as the instant at which the parton is created .",
    "we employ the same cef that was introduced in @xcite to study the prdouction rate in phase space .",
    "it is given by @xmath31 this choice is close to the boost invariant configuration required in the bjorken scenario @xcite .",
    "the gauge group is @xmath32 , and the field is dependent only on @xmath33 .",
    "the probability along the transverse directions is , therefore , uniform , _",
    "i. e. _ , a gaussian distribution with a width given given by the diameter of the nucleus .",
    "this dimension remains constant in time .",
    "however , the longitudinal extension has to be determined explicitly .",
    "we obtained the production probability density for gluons and quarks in the one - particle configuration space by performing a multi - dimensional fast fourier transform on the momentum space amplitude , and integrating over the unwanted degrees of freedom .",
    "the densities are shown in figs . 1 and 2 as functions of @xmath34 for different time instants namely @xmath35 in units of @xmath36 .",
    "the probability densities are displayed only on the positive @xmath34 axis .",
    "the negative half is symmetric about @xmath37 .",
    "the range of the probabilities ( unnormalised ! ) is truncated in order to improve the visibility of the important features of the curves .",
    "the probability densities at @xmath37 are large but finite .",
    "these curves shed light on an interesting aspect of the source .",
    "recall that the cef has a support in the interval @xmath38 at any time @xmath30 , with the two nuclei at @xmath39 moving with unit speed in opposite directions .",
    "we may expect , nively , that the particle production should also be restricted within the interval @xmath40 .",
    "the graphs clearly bely these classical expectations .",
    "the required features are most pronounced in fig .",
    "1 , where we show the results for the gluons .",
    "strikingly , the probability density does not terminate at @xmath41 .",
    "instead , it extends beyond , as a broad plateau all the way upto @xmath42 , where it falls abruptly , and almost discontinuously .",
    "this feature is universal for all the curves , indicating that the point @xmath42 is naturally chosen as the boundary by the system dynamics . in that sense , we do not have to extract any length scale by curve fittings .",
    "the quark results are shown in fig .",
    "2 , again for times ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , in units of @xmath36 .",
    "the results are not that vivid at earlier times .",
    "however , the features get more pronounced as the system evolves so that the plateau structure is clearly delineated at @xmath45 .",
    "the remarkable aspect of these conclusions is that the size of the system is quintessentially non - classical .",
    "indeed , the particles are found in regions where the field identically vanishes .",
    "since the boundary of the cef located at @xmath46 is moving with the speed of light , causality forbids the particles produced any time in the interval @xmath28 within the range @xmath47 from reaching the regions outside the interval .",
    "one concludes that the particles are indeed produced in the region where cef vanishes identically ! we suspect that this could be a generic property of the class of cef that we have employed .",
    "it is important to note that the plateau position and its extension has a topological nature : the magnitudes change smoothly as the sytem evolves with the time , but the location of the shoulder is pegged at the value @xmath48 .",
    "a straight forward conclusion that one draws is that longitudinally , the qgp source is twice as large as the space between the two nuclei .",
    "the fireball extends beyond the two nuclei .",
    "a more quantitative understanding can be obtained by looking at the relative probability for finding the particles in the regions @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the ratio for the gluons varies from a maximum of about @xmath51 at @xmath52 , to @xmath53 at @xmath44 . for the quarks , on the other hand , it varies from @xmath54 at @xmath52 to @xmath55 at @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , the non - classical features are the most pronounced when the field is varying most rapidly , and gets less important as the field evolves in time .",
    "also , should these results seem surprising , we may recall that the probabilities in the regions where the field is vanishing are , in fact smaller than the probability that an oscillator in its ground state is found in the classically forbidden region . with this perspective",
    ", we may conclude that the production in the regions where the field vanishes identically is a quantum effect ; the occurence of the step at @xmath56 is perhaps a feature of the class of fields which have a boost invariant nature , or are close to it .",
    "a final question remains as to why the spread in the quarks is less than that of gluons as indicated by the numbers above .",
    "the reason for this may be attributed , in part , to the fact that the two gluon amplitude is antisymmetric in the colour and the momentum indices of the two gluons ( see eqn .",
    "2 . by bose symmetry ,",
    "it is symmetric in the spins ) .",
    "consequently , the amplitude will be antisymmetric in the position variables @xmath57 as well .",
    "the quark case on the other hand , has the charge conjugation symmetry which , when employed similarly , leads to a symmetric behaviour in the spatial part which inhibits the spread .",
    "in fact , the spread in the momentum probabilities is larger for quarks than for the gluons , as found in @xcite . by the uncertainty principle , one may expect the quark size to be smaller than that of the gluons .",
