    "a number of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors ( ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama ) are now running @xcite , and the ligo detector has reached design sensitivity . in the coming decade",
    "the initial ligo detector will be upgraded to advanced ligo .",
    "for all such detectors , the inspiral signals from neutron star and/or black hole binaries are among the strongest expected sources ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) . in the late stages of inspiral",
    ", gravitational radiation backreaction will have circularized the components orbits , and before the final plunge there will be an ",
    "adiabatic \" regime where the period of a single orbit is much shorter than the inspiral timescale .",
    "this part of the inspiral is relatively  clean \" and well - understood , so that the waveforms it produces can be modeled with great precision .",
    "this has been done in the so - called post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity , where waveforms are expressed as expansions in the orbital velocity @xmath3 ( see @xcite for a review and extensive references ) .",
    "the best waveforms currently available are of order @xmath4 in amplitude @xcite and @xmath5 in phase @xcite , which in the usual notation corresponds to 2.5pn and 3.5pn orders , respectively .",
    "these take the form of linear combinations of harmonics in the orbital phase .",
    "the second harmonic is the one that will usually dominate ; it is the only one with a zeroth - order pn contribution to its amplitude . in most of the literature on adiabatic",
    "inspiral , one uses the _ restricted _ post - newtonian approximation @xcite , where all amplitude corrections are discarded and only pn contributions to the phase are taken into account .",
    "thus , the restricted pn waveform consists of just the second harmonic with a prefactor at zeroth pn order .",
    "an efficient way of searching for inspiral signals in data is matched filtering @xcite , which involves a bank of templates .",
    "almost all templates currently used are based on the restricted pn approximation .",
    "the same kinds of waveforms that go into template banks are also used as simulated signals injected into stretches of data to evaluate algorithms that search for real events and veto spurious ones .",
    "these include the standard restricted pn waveforms , the so - called p - approximants @xcite , and the effective one - body ( eob ) waveforms @xcite . the latter two result from resummation schemes designed to improve on the convergence of the phasing .",
    "the phenomenological templates for binary black hole inspiral that were recently proposed by buonanno , chen , pan , and vallisneri @xcite do have some simple corrections to their amplitudes , but they are still quite limited compared to the full amplitude - corrected waveforms .",
    "overall the emphasis has been on the evolution of the phase rather than the amplitude , due to the belief that it is more important to know the phasing and number of cycles ( or more precisely the number of useful cycles @xcite ) of the signal in the detector s bandwidth .    to our knowledge",
    "it has never been investigated in detail to what extent the use of restricted waveforms as templates and simulated signals is justified beyond heuristic considerations .",
    "sintes and vecchio @xcite did study the effect of 0.5pn amplitude corrections on signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , this happens to be a very special case ; in going from 0pn to 0.5pn in amplitude , snrs will increase , but from 1pn onwards there will be a pronounced drop , at least for stellar mass inspirals as seen in initial detectors .",
    "the effect of 2pn amplitude corrections on parameter estimation was studied by hellings and moore @xcite , but specifically in the context of lisa and without discussing the effect of higher harmonics on detection rates for systems with various masses . here",
    "we investigate the use of non - restricted versus restricted waveforms for the purposes of detection , focusing on three ground - based detectors : initial ligo , advanced ligo , and a possible third - generation detector called the european gravitational - wave observatory ( ego ) @xcite .    given a waveform @xmath6 , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the  detection \" of @xmath6 using its normalized counterpart as a template is given by @xmath7 \\equiv ( h|h)^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath8 is the usual inner product in terms of the noise power spectral density @xmath9 of the detector . with the convention @xmath10 for fourier transforms , ( x|y ) 4_f_s^f_end df .",
    "[ innerproduct ]    let @xmath11 be a restricted waveform and @xmath6 a waveform that is of 2.5pn order in amplitude and 3.5pn in phase , with both having the same parameters . with the above notation ,",
    "@xmath12 $ ] is the kind of snr one encounters in current simulated searches . in the future",
    "one may want to consider amplitude - corrected waveforms @xmath6 both for templates and simulated signals , in which case one would arrive at snrs @xmath7 $ ] . as indicated in an earlier paper @xcite in the context of initial detectors and stellar mass binaries , one has < .",
    "[ overestimation ] hence , surprisingly , if one were to use the best available amplitude - corrected waveforms for detection templates , one should expect snrs in actual searches to be lower than those suggested by simulations based purely on restricted pn waveforms . in initial ligo this overestimation can be as large as 25% depending on what the parameter values are . because snr is inversely proportional to distance , this corresponds to an overestimation of the accessible spatial volume , and hence the detection rate , by up to a factor of two .",
    "moreover , snrs exhibit a downward trend as the post - newtonian order of the amplitudes is increased from 1pn to 2.5pn in steps of 0.5pn .",
    "should this trend continue then the overestimation would be worse still when taking into account amplitude corrections beyond the highest pn order currently available . a rough indication of the origin of ( [ overestimation ] ) was already given in @xcite .",
    "the effect can be traced to the pn amplitude corrections of the dominant harmonic . here",
    "we will provide a much more detailed analysis .",
    "the situation is different for second and third generation detectors . in the frequency domain",
    ", the third and higher harmonics in amplitude - corrected waveforms are cut off at higher frequencies than the dominant one .",
    "because the cut - off frequencies are inversely proportional to total mass , this means that higher harmonics may still enter the detector s bandwidth even if the dominant harmonic does not . in advanced detectors",
    "these harmonics can lead to a sizeable snr . if the second harmonic does not enter the bandwidth , or if it enters only in a small frequency interval , the inequality ( [ overestimation ] ) is reversed .",
    "this opens up the possibility of seeing intermediate - mass inspiral events with higher total mass than one would expect on the basis of the restricted waveforms .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of amplitude - corrected higher harmonics in detection templates would effectively double the accessible mass range of advanced ligo , and it would triple that of ego . for intermediate - mass inspirals",
    "the detection rates from non - restricted waveforms are several orders of magnitude larger than the ones computed from the restricted waveforms .",
    "stellar mass inspirals would be detectable with ego throughout a significant part of the visible universe .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : waveforms ]",
    "we discuss the amplitude - corrected waveforms , as seen in a detector , up to 2.5pn in amplitude and 3.5pn in phase in the stationary phase approximation . in section [ s : snrs ]",
    "we compare signal - to - noise ratios using restricted and non - restricted waveforms as templates and simulated signals in initial ligo .",
    "the numerical results are explained analytically up to 1pn in amplitude .",
    "we then focus on the advantages of non - restricted templates in advanced detectors ( section [ s : advanced ] ) , including a third generation detector called ego .",
    "finally we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "expressions for the harmonics in the amplitude - corrected waveform can be found in appendix a. we will go into some detail , outlining the general form of the harmonics up to 2.5pn in amplitude and giving explicit expressions up to 1pn .",
    "these expressions are also to be the basis for future work @xcite , where we will use the amplitude - corrected waveforms for parameter estimation .    sensitivity curves for detectors will be taken as in @xcite , except for the ego noise curve which can be found in appendix c. unless stated otherwise we use units such that @xmath13 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath14pn for waveforms that have pn corrections up to order @xmath15 in amplitude and @xmath16 in phase .",
    "integrals of the form ( [ innerproduct ] ) can not be performed analytically and were obtained numerically using the software package mathematica . finally , when plotting quantities against mass in a cosmological context , we will give precedence to physical mass over ( redshifted ) observed mass .",
    "this is because we will encounter relatively large redshifts , in which case the use of observed mass would obscure the astrophysical consequences of the results .",
    "the waveforms in the two polarizations take the general form h_+,= x \\{h^(0)_+ , + x^1/2h^(1/2)_+ , + x h^(1)_+ , + x^3/2h^(3/2)_+ , + x^2 h^(2)_+ , + x^5/2 h^(5/2)_+ , } [ hpluscross ] where @xmath17 is the distance to the binary , @xmath18 its total mass , and @xmath19 the ratio of reduced mass to total mass .",
    "the post - newtonian expansion parameter is defined as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the instantaneous orbital frequency .",

    "the measured signal also depends on the polarization angle and the position in the sky through the detector s beam pattern functions @xmath25 : h(t)=f_+ h_+(t ) + f_h_(t ) . [ signal ] note that for ground - based detectors , which are the ones we will be concerned with , it is reasonable to approximate @xmath25 as being constant over the duration of the signal .",
    "they depend on angles @xmath26 , where @xmath27 determine sky position while @xmath28 is the polarization angle .",
    "the signal ( [ signal ] ) is a linear combination of harmonics of the orbital phase @xmath29 with offsets @xmath30 : h(t ) = _ k=1^n_p _ m=0 ^ 2p a_(k , m/2)(t ) ( k(t ) + _ ( k , m/2 ) ) , [ lincomb ] where the coefficients @xmath31 are functions of @xmath32 multiplied by @xmath33 .",

    "newtonian \" prefactor @xmath55 is taken outside and the remaining expression is expanded in @xmath56 up to @xmath57 ) .",
    "the spa is just one method of approximating the fourier transform ; the main alternative is the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the difference between the two in terms of overlap and snrs tends to be only a few percent for restricted waveforms , at least in initial detectors , and the situation improves dramatically as the detector s sensitivity at low frequencies is increased .",
    "we also note that the conditions for the applicability of the stationary phase approximation on the harmonics become more favorable with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the reason why we prefer to work with the spa is that it will give us direct analytic insight into the effect on detection rates of the presence or absence of amplitude corrections .",
    "finally , the expressions for the respective harmonics should not be used up to arbitrarily large frequencies ; some maximum orbital frequency must be chosen at which waveforms are truncated . in the limit",
    "where one of the component masses is sent to zero while keeping total mass fixed , there is a well - defined last stable orbit with orbital frequency f_lso = , [ flso ] where @xmath18 is total mass . for binary systems with comparable component masses",
    "the situation is more involved @xcite , but for simplicity we adopt ( [ flso ] ) as a formal expression also in that case . in the time domain",
    "we will consider the waveform to be valid only up to a time determined by @xmath58 . in the frequency domain",
    "this roughly corresponds to cutting off the @xmath0th harmonic at a frequency @xmath59 . to reflect this restriction on the validity of the harmonics , in practice",

    ", we will take it to be 40 hz , 20 hz , and 10 hz , respectively ( see appendix c ) .",
    "we now turn to the issue of signal - to - noise ratio in initial ligo .",
    "apart from binary neutron star inspirals , the inspiral events of main interest in the case of initial detectors are those involving stellar mass black holes .",
    "these result from massive main - sequence binary stellar systems ( field binaries ) or from capture processes in galactic centers or globular clusters ( capture binaries ) .",

    "<S> the discussion is extended to advanced detectors , where new features emerge . </S>",
    "<S> non - restricted waveforms are linear combinations of harmonics in the orbital phase , and in the frequency domain the @xmath0th harmonic is cut off at @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the orbital frequency at the last stable orbit . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> with non - restricted templates it is possible to achieve sizeable signal - to - noise ratios in cases where the dominant harmonic ( which is the one at twice the orbital phase ) does not enter the detector s bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this will have important repercussions on the detection of binary inspirals involving intermediate - mass black holes . for sources at a distance of 100 mpc , taking into account the higher harmonics will double the mass reach of advanced ligo , and that of ego gets tripled . </S>",
