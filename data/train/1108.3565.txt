    "the modified newtonian dynamics theory ( mond ) was introduced by milgrom to solve the galaxies rotation curves problem as an alternative to the dark matter .",
    "the mond can be implemented by a modification of the newton s second law or the newton s law of gravity .",
    "in particular milgrom ( in the formulation where the newton s second law is modified ) allowed for an inertia term not to be proportional to the acceleration of the object but rather to be a more general function of it .",
    "more precisely , it has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 , replacing the classical form @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is also the inertial mass of a body moving in an arbitrary static force field @xmath6 with acceleration @xmath7 , see @xcite . for accelerations much larger than the acceleration constant @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 , and newtonian dynamics is restored .",
    "however for small accelerations @xmath10 we have that @xmath11 . in this case",
    "if @xmath6 is the gravitational force of a central mass @xmath12 , then the modulus of the acceleration is @xmath13 .",
    "this acceleration gives a constant velocity @xmath14{gma_0}$ ] in a circular orbit and the correct value of the galactic rotational curves .",
    "however , it has been shown that milgrom theory , while solving a few difficulties , gives rises to other fresh problems , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the fundamental objection to a modification of the inertia is that it violates the equivalence principle , tested to an accuracy of @xmath15 , see @xcite , and the energy conservation .",
    "the version of mond presented is not a consistent theory and it is only a phenomenological approach . to solve these problems bekenstein and milgrom proposed in @xcite a nonrelativistic potencial theory for gravity which differs from the newtonian one . in @xcite simple analytical forms of @xmath16 are analyzed and satisfactory fits to the observationally determined terminal velocity curve are obtained . a theoretical argument that supports a certain form of @xmath16 against other",
    "is still not known . in @xcite",
    "we made a first approximation to the problem and deduced the following form of @xmath16 , in the context of the mach s principle @xmath17 this simple form of @xmath16 yields very good results in fitting the terminal velocity curve of milky way and others , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite a new form for the @xmath16 appearing in the milgrom formula was obtained : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an effective acceleration given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the distance to the object and @xmath22 is the radius of the causal connected universe . for local objects we have @xmath23 and for far away objects @xmath24",
    ". equation ( [ for ] ) contains ( [ eq ] ) as a particular case .",
    "the form of @xmath16 presented in @xcite is a modification of the inertia following the ideas developed by milgrom in @xcite , using the relativity principle of motion and assuming the proven fact of the accelerated expansion of the universe . in the formula ( [ for ] ) we have a vectorial sum of accelerations and depending if the vectors are quasi - collinear or are perpendicular the vectorial sum gives different values .",
    "in @xcite it is also established a relation between the mond and the deceleration parameter of the expansion of the universe .",
    "verlinde propose a model where the second newton law and newton s law of gravitation arise from basic thermodynamic mechanisms . in the context of verline s holographic model ,",
    "the response of a body to the force may be understood in terms of the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we consider a holographic screen in the plane @xmath25 that intersects de @xmath26 axis at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a small increment distance .",
    "as the body approaches the screen , its descriptive information becomes encoded holographically on the screen .",
    "the entropy of the screen increase by some amount @xmath29 . in a similar way in which a particle approaching the event horizon of a schwarzschild black hole increases the entropy of the horizon , in @xcite",
    "is proposed that @xmath30 when the body traverse the distance @xmath28 , its energy changes by an amount @xmath31 , which is the incremental work done by the force @xmath32 . using the first law of thermodynamics",
    ", the model sets that @xmath33 an observer in an accelerated frame experiences the associated unruh @xcite temperature @xmath34 the second law of newton @xmath35 follows from substituting in ( [ 2 ] ) equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "now is supposed that the boundary is a closed surface , it is assumed that is an sphere .",
    "assuming that the holographic principle holds , the maximal storage space , or the total number of bits , is proportional to the area of the boundary @xmath36 where a new constant @xmath37 is introduced .",
    "the total energy is given by the equipartition rule @xmath38 now we consider the total energy enclosed by the screen is given by a mass @xmath12 i.e. is satisfied @xmath39 . now equating this equation with equation ( [ 5 ] ) and substituting equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) we obtain the newton s law of gravitation @xmath40 and",
    "the constant @xmath37 is the universal gravitational constant . from this",
    "arguments it is stated in @xcite the entropic origin of gravity because the acceleration is related with an entropy gradient .",
    "more precisely , gravity is explained as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies .",
    "the consequences of this general theory are being analyzed and discussed .",
    "the cosmological acceleration can be explained using the entropic force , see @xcite .",
    "other important consequence related to this work is that the verlinde s holographic model in an asymptotically de sitter space leads to a new form of the second law of motion which is the required by the mond theory proposed by milgrom , see @xcite .",
    "therefore the phenomenological milgrom formulation is supported by verlinde s theory . in @xcite",
    "it is demonstrate that , in a universe endowed by a positive cosmological constant @xmath41 , the holographic model described by verlinde leads naturally to a modification of the second newton s law of the form @xmath42 = f,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "moreover equation ( [ fu1 ] ) is identical to the specific formulation of mond suggested by milgrom in @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath44 arbitrarily large ( [ fu1 ] ) becomes identical to the newton second law and for @xmath45 we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 plays the role of the constant acceleration @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , if we assume that the present evolution of the universe is dominated by the cosmological constant @xmath41 , as corroborated by observation @xcite , we can set @xmath48 which implies that @xmath49 in orders of magnitude . the relation between @xmath8 and the cosmological constant it is also discussed in @xcite in the context of the scaling laws that suggest a fractal universe .",
    "the pioneer anomaly @xcite consists of unexpected , almost constant and uniform acceleration directed approximately towards the sun @xmath50 first detected in the analyzed data of the pioneer probes after they passed the threshold of 20 astronomical units .",
    "however , the recent new data of the pioneer anomaly suggest that it is variable and environment dependent rather than a fixed value and still is not clear its direction with the possibility that be earth directed , see @xcite .",
    "the effects of the pioneer anomaly are non - detected on the major bodies of the solar system and in several papers is studied its gravitational origin , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "meanwhile there exits other works where it is studied its non - gravitational origin , see @xcite .",
    "the pioneer anomaly is similar to the galaxy rotation problem which also involves an unexplained acceleration .",
    "milgrom realized that mond could explain the pioneer anomaly , see @xcite .",
    "the modified - inertia approaches to solve the pioneer anomaly have been also considered under unruh radiation by mcculloch , see @xcite .",
    "this proposal acquires its meaning in the wake of the holographic scenario established in the work of verlinde @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is found that the acceleration of the pioneer craft is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the sun mass , @xmath53 appear in the wien s constant and has the value @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the hubble diameter @xmath56 .",
    "the second term can be rearranged to give @xmath57 we are going to see that we obtain equation ( [ ess ] ) in the context of phenomenological formulation of mond .",
    "we use equation ( [ for ] ) for the pioneer craft , with the approximation @xmath58 because we are dealing with a local object and taking into account that the accelerations are quasi - collinear because the pioneer craft performs an orbit away from us ( hence we can use equation ( [ eq ] ) ) . in a strong newtonian regime",
    ", we can develop the term @xmath59 in the case @xmath60 i.e. @xmath61 . now substituting in ( [ eq ] ) ( taking the modulus )",
    "we have @xmath62 we can rearrange this equation to obtain @xmath63 from the equivalence principle we have @xmath64 and ( [ des2 ] ) becomes @xmath65 in @xcite and @xcite it is justified by different arguments that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the actual value of the hubble constant , see also @xcite .",
    "therefore we have obtained equation ( [ ess ] ) . the arguments to obtain @xmath66",
    "are the following . in @xcite using the equivalence principle , which implies the equality between inertial mass @xmath5 and gravitational mass @xmath68 , it is obtained the relation @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath22 is the mass and the radius of the universe respectively . then substituting this expression in the definition of @xmath8 in the sense of the mach s principle the result follows . in @xcite the relation @xmath66 is obtained through the scale factor of the universe @xmath71 and the hubble law of expansion of the universe .",
    "hence , the pioneer anomaly is given by @xmath8 that taking into account that @xmath72 we obtain that @xmath73 , which is in agreement with the observed value anomaly @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 uncertainty arises because of uncertainties in the hubble constant .",
    "the value of @xmath76 is about six times larger than the acceleration constant @xmath77 required for mond of milgrom for fitting galaxy velocity curves .",
    "however , the constant acceleration @xmath8 is also present in the inner solar system where it is dramatically inconsistent with the motion of the inner planets if we use equation ( [ eq ] ) or similar versions of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , it fails completely in the strong gravity regime where @xmath78 , and thus can not be valid in the solar system .",
    "for instance , the upper limit on an additional constant acceleration imposed by the observed precession of the orbit of mercury is more than a factor of 10 smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "similar constrains result from the observed motion of icarus . in general ,",
    "such peculiar acceleration is constrained by observations to be about one or two orders of magnitude lower than @xmath8 in the inner solar system , see @xcite .",
    "hence , one must argue that the mond acts in a very different way for local bound objects like planets .",
    "this has already pointed out by milgrom in @xcite .",
    "sanders in @xcite concludes that if the effects of the mondian modification of gravity are not observed in the motion of the outer planets in the solar system , the acceleration can not be due to mond .",
    "solar system constraints on multifield theories of modified dynamics .",
    "the @xmath16 function ( [ for ] ) used in this paper also present these problems .",
    "nevertheless , the result obtained for the pioneer anomaly reinforces that it must be earth directed and variable and environment dependent , because it depends on the relative position of the pioneer craft and the earth in its own movement along its orbit around the sun .",
    "a simple modification of the @xmath16 function does not save mond from its inherent problems .",
    "in a recent review of the pioneer anomaly is said that the pioneer anomaly has nothing to do with mond , see @xcite . in this survey",
    "it is also said that  the exact form of @xmath16 remains unspecified in both mond and the relativistic version of teves proposed by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that an appropriately chosen @xmath16 might reproduce the pioneer anomaly even as the theory s main result , its ability to account for galaxy rotation curves , is not affected \" .",
    "this also happens with the new expression of @xmath16 presented in this paper .",
    "it is still open to find the form of @xmath16 consistent with the observational data which establish differences between the unbounded orbits ( like the pioneer craft ) and the bounded orbits ( like the planets ) . in the framework of mond , the internal dynamics of a gravitating system @xmath79 embedded in a larger one @xmath80",
    "is affected by the external background field e of @xmath80 even if it is constant and uniform , thus implying a violation of the strong equivalence principle : it is the so - called external field effect ( efe ) .",
    "milgrom @xcite originally introduced efe in order to explain that the observed mass in certain open star clusters in the galactic neighborhood of the solar system was very low , although their internal accelerations were 5 or 10 times smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "the galactic acceleration felt by such open clusters is just of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "the first , preliminary attempts to look at efe in the oort cloud were made by milgrom in @xcite . more detailed analysis on efe in the oort cloud",
    "is made by iorio in @xcite .",
    "efe was adapted to the planetary regions of the solar system , where the field is strong , see @xcite .",
    "some implications were discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that several studies of mond were performed in the solar system , see @xcite .",
    "anyway , the correct version of mond to be constructed in the future must be derived from the new holographic scenario . in @xcite ,",
    "based on the hypothesis of the gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter , what allows considering , the virtual particle ",
    "antiparticle pairs in the physical vacuum , as gravitational dipoles , it is argued that the pioneer anomaly and the mond is related to the quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "two speculative but exciting papers which may help provide insight into the nature of the dark energy of the universe ."
