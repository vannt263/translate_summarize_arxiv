    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite has been one of the most promising candidates for a theory of fundamental particles and interactions going beyond the standard model ( sm ) ; the so - called bsm physics .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm including susy , namely , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , extends the particle spectrum of the sm by one additional higgs doublet and the supersymmetric partners of all the sm particles - the * s*particles .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the sm provides a particularly elegant solution to the problem of stabilizing the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking scale against large radiative correction and keeps the higgs  naturally  light .",
    "in fact , a very robust upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson is perhaps one of the important predictions of this theory .",
    "further , this upper limit is linked in an essential way to the values of some of the susy breaking parameters in the theory . in addition , in @xmath10parity conserving susy , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) emerges as the natural candidate for the dark matter ( dm),the existence of which has been proved beyond any doubt in astrophysical experiments . the search for evidence of the realization of this symmetry in nature(in the context of high energy collider experiments , precision measurements at the high intensity b  factories and in the dm detection experiments ) has therefore received enormous attention of particle physicists , perhaps only next to the higgs boson .",
    "the recent observation of a boson with mass around @xmath11 gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite and the rather strong lower limits on the masses of sparticles that possess strong interactions that the lhc searches have yielded@xcite , necessitates careful studies of the mssm in the context of all the recent low energy data . in these studies ,",
    "it is also very important to seek suitable guiding principles which could possibly reduce the associated large number of susy breaking parameters of mssm .",
    "thus , looking for modes of specific susy breaking mechanisms that involve only a few input quantities given at a relevant scale can be useful . here , the soft susy breaking parameters at the electroweak scale are found via renormalization group ( rg ) analyses . apart from the simplicity of having a few parameters as input ,",
    "such schemes create challenging balancing acts . on the one hand , various soft breaking masses and couplings become correlated with one another in such schemes . on the other hand ,",
    "overall one has to accommodate a large number of very stringent low energy constraints in a comprehensive model consisting of only a few parameters .",
    "a simple and well - motivated example of a susy model is the minimal supergravity ( msugra)@xcite . here , susy is broken spontaneously in a hidden sector and the breaking is communicated to the observable sector where mssm resides via planck mass suppressed supergravity interactions .",
    "the model involves soft - susy breaking parameters like ( i ) universal gaugino mass parameter @xmath12 , ( ii ) the universal scalar mass parameter @xmath13 , ( iii ) the universal trilinear coupling @xmath14 , ( iv ) the universal bilinear coupling @xmath15 , all given at the gauge coupling unification scale .",
    "in addition to it , one has the superpotential related higgsino mixing parameter @xmath16 with its associated sign parameter .",
    "the two radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) conditions may then be used so as to replace @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the z - boson mass @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values . similar to msugra , one has other susy breaking scenarios like the gauge mediated susy breaking and models with anomaly mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) etc@xcite . apart from direct collider physics data , one has to satisfy constraints from flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) as well as flavor conserving phenomena like the anomalous magnetic moment of muon , constraints like electric dipole moments associated with cp violations or to check whether there is a proper amount of dark matter content in an r - parity conserving scenarios or proper neutrino masses in r - parity violating scenarios@xcite .",
    "a single model is yet to be found that can adequately explain various stringent experimental results and at the same time possesses a sufficient degree of predictiveness .",
    "howevr , it is always important to continue the quest of a simple model and check the degree of agreement with low energy constraints .    in this work ,",
    "we pursue a predictive theory of susy breaking by considering a field theory on a superspace where the grassmannian coordinates are essentially fluctuating / stochastic@xcite .",
    "we note that in a given susy breaking scenario , our limitation of knowing the actual mechanism of breaking susy is manifested in the soft parameters . here , in stochastic superspace framework we assume that a manifestation of an unknown but a fundamental mechanism of susy breaking may effectively lead to stochasticity in the grassmannian parameters of the superspace . with a suitably chosen probability distribution",
    ", this causes a given khler potential and a superpotential to lead to soft breaking terms that carry signatures of the stochasticity .",
    "as we will see , the susy breaking is parametrized by @xmath1 which is nothing but @xmath19 , where the symbol @xmath20 refers to averaging over the grassmannian coordinates .",
    "the other scale that is involved is @xmath3 .",
    "values of various soft parameters at this scale are the input parameters of the scheme .",
    "the values of the same at the electroweak scale are then obtained from these input values by using the renormalization group evolution . considering the superpotential of mssm ,",
    "the soft terms obtained are readily recognized as the ones supplied by the externally added soft susy breaking terms of constrained mssm ( cmssm)@xcite , except that the model is unable to produce a scalar mass soft term@xcite .",
    "reference @xcite used @xmath3 and @xmath1 as free parameters while analyzing the low energy signatures within mssm .",
    "@xmath3 was chosen between @xmath4 to @xmath21 , the scale of gauge coupling unification and the planck mass scale respectively .",
    "the model as given in ref.@xcite is called as stochastic supersymmetric model ( ssm ) and it is characterized by universal gaugino mass parameter @xmath12 , universal trilinear soft susy breaking parameter @xmath14 , and universal bilinear soft susy breaking parameter @xmath15 , all being related to @xmath1 , the parameter related to susy breaking .",
    "we note that with the bilinear soft susy parameter being given , @xmath22 , becomes a derived quantity .",
    "however , as already mentioned , in spite of the fact that the ssm generates soft susy breaking terms , it produces no scalar mass soft term .",
    "scalar masses start from zero at the scale @xmath3 and renormalization group evolution is used to generate scalar masses at the electroweak scale @xmath23 .",
    "scalar masses at @xmath23 severely constrain the model because typically scalars are very light . in particular , quite often sleptons turn to be the lightest supersymmetric particles or even become tachyonic over a large part of the parameter space .",
    "this is partially ameliorated when one takes the high scale @xmath3 to be larger than the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath24  gev .",
    "however , in spite of obtaining valid parameter space that would provide us with a lightest neutralino as a possible dark matter candidate in r - parity preserving framework , we must note that the low values that one obtains for the masses of the first two generation of squarks are hardly something of an advantage in view of the constraints coming from fcnc as well as those from the lhc data@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", ssm has a natural advantage of being associated with a nonvanishing trilinear coupling that is favorable to produce a relatively light spectra for a given value of higgs boson mass @xmath2 .",
    "the recent announcement from the cms and atlas collaborations of the lhc experiment about the discovery of a higgs - like boson at @xmath11  gev@xcite thus makes this model potentially attractive .",
    "however , as explored in ref.@xcite , ssm as such is unable to accommodate such a large @xmath2 in spite of having a built - in feature of having a nonvanishing @xmath14 .",
    "it could at most reach 116 gev for @xmath2@xcite and the constraint due to @xmath25 as used in ref.@xcite was much less stringent in comparison to the same of present day@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is also important to investigate the effect of the direct detection rate of dark matter as constrained by the recent xenon100 data@xcite .    in this analysis",
    ", we would like to give all the input parameters at the grand unification scale @xmath4 , the scale at which the standard model gauge group , namely , @xmath26 , comes into existence .",
    "any evolution above @xmath4 would obviously demand choosing a suitable gauge group ; a question that is not going to be addressed in this work . in this way we would like to avoid unknown issues arising out of a post - grand unified theory(gut)@xcite physics .",
    "however , we would rather try to meet the phenomenological demand of confronting the issue of sleptons becoming tachyonic or avoiding scalar masses to become light in general in a _ minimal modification _ by considering an externally given scalar mass soft parameter @xmath27 as a manifestation of an additional origin of susy breaking",
    ". it would be useful to have the first two generations of scalar masses adequately heavy so as to overcome the fcnc related constraints and lhc data@xcite on squark masses .",
    "additionally this will also be consistent with having the lighter higgs boson mass ( @xmath2 ) to be in the vicinity of 125 gev .",
    "we will henceforth denote the model as * mod - ssm*.    we may note that traditionally minimal versions of models of susy breaking have been extended for phenomenological reasons .",
    "it is also true that extending a minimal model often lowers predictiveness and may even cause partial dilution of the main motivations associated with the building of the model .",
    "for example , considering nonuniversal gaugino or scalar mass scenarios may be more suitable than cmssm or msugra so as to obtain a relatively lighter spectra in the context feasibility of exploring via lhc .",
    "another example may be given in the context of the minimal amsb model .",
    "as we know , a pure amsb scenario@xcite is associated with form invariance of the renormalization group equations ( rge ) of scalar masses and absence of flavor violation .",
    "however , it produces tachyonic sleptons . in the minimal amsb model@xcite",
    "one introduces an additional common mass parameter @xmath27 for all the scalars of the theory .",
    "this ameliorates the tachyonic slepton problem but it is true that we sacrifice the much cherished feature of form invariance and accept some degree of flavor violations at the end .",
    "we would like to explore a non - minimal scenario of stochastic supersymmetry model , namely , mod - ssm in this spirit .",
    "we particularly keep in mind that the stochastic supersymmetry formalism may be used not only within the mssm framework but it may be extended to superpotentials beyond that of the mssm@xcite .",
    "the fact that the model with a minimal modification can easily accommodate the recent higgs boson mass range by its generic feature of having a nonvanishing trilinear coupling parameter makes it further attractive .",
    "we believe that our approach of considering an additional susy breaking scalar mass term is justified for phenomenological reasons .",
    "thus , in mod - ssm we consider the input of soft term parameters @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 ( all are either proportional to @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) and a universal scalar mass soft parameter @xmath27 , all being given at a suitable scale which we simply choose as the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath4 considering the lep data on gauge couplings could be a hint of the existence of grand unification . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we would also restrict @xmath1 to be real , either positive or negative .",
    "we clearly like to emphasize that the ssm framework produces no scalar mass soft term at a scale @xmath3 . with @xmath3",
    "set to the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath4 , ssm is plagued with tachyonic sleptons . with @xmath30 one",
    "can avoid tachyonic scalar but there is no scope of obtaining the currently accepted higgs boson mass . in mod - ssm",
    "we consider @xmath5 and add the extra scalar mass term for an additional susy breaking effect . with the trilinear coupling parameter @xmath14 and the bilinear coupling parameter @xmath15 becoming correlated with @xmath12 , mod - ssm parameter space is essentially a subset of the one for the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) . in mod - ssm ,",
    "the ssm inspired nonvanishing @xmath14 parameter is suitable for producing an appropriately large loop correction to the lighter higgs boson mass while keeping the overall sparticle spectra relatively at a lower range .",
    "cmssm , on the other hand , does not pinpoint with any fundamental physical distinction / motivation for such a zone of parameter space that is capable of producing the correct higgs mass with similarly smaller sparticle mass scale .",
    "even if we consider the stochastic superspace model in its original form as only a toy idea , we believe that it may be worthwhile to explore it with minimal modifications in regard to the current higgs boson mass , as well as other phenomenological constraints .",
    "as seen in ref.@xcite we consider an @xmath0 superspace where the grassmannian coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 are taken to be stochastic in nature .",
    "one starts with identifying the terms involving superfields in the superpotential and the kinetic energy terms that could be used to construct the susy invariant lagrangian density for a given model .",
    "each term is then multiplied with a probability distribution function @xmath33 and integrated over the grassmannian coordinates appropriately .",
    "@xmath34 can be expanded into terms involving @xmath35 and @xmath32 which obviously has a finite number of terms because of the grassmannian nature of @xmath35 and @xmath32 .",
    "one then imposes the normalization condition @xmath36 and vanishing of lorentz nonscalar moments like @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the stochasticity parameter @xmath1 is defined as @xmath39 . here",
    ", @xmath1 is a complex parameter with mass dimension unity . as computed in ref.@xcite , and as worked out in this analysis explicitly in the appendix , the above leads to the following hermitian probability distribution . @xmath40 for the simple case of a wess - zumino type of scenario@xcite where the kinetic term is obtained from @xmath41 and the superpotential is given as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a chiral superfield , one finds that the effect of stochasticity as described above leads to the following susy breaking term : @xmath44    applying the stochasticity idea to the superpotential of mssm , along with considering the effect on the gauge kinetic energy function , the above formalism leads to the following tree level soft susy breaking parameters to be given at the high scale @xmath3 : + a. universal gaugino mass parameter @xmath45 , + b. universal trilinear soft parameter @xmath46 , + c. universal bilinear higgs soft parameter @xmath47 .",
    "+ recall that there is no scalar mass soft susy breaking term in ssm .",
    "+ for convenience we take @xmath1 to be a real positive number with an additional input sign@xmath48 . if we count the universal gaugino mass parameter @xmath12 as the independent parameter , we have , @xmath49 as has already been discussed before , we introduce a nonvanishing scalar mass parameter @xmath27 and fix @xmath3 at @xmath4.@xcite . ]",
    "thus with the above extension , the input quantities for the stochastic susy model are :    @xmath12 , @xmath27 , sign(@xmath50 ) and sign(@xmath1 ) .",
    "we note that the model quite naturally is associated with nonvanishing trilinear soft breaking terms .",
    "as we will see , this is quite interesting in view of the recent lhc announcement for the higgs mass range centering around 125 gev@xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we will discuss only the case of @xmath51 because the other sign of @xmath1 does not produce a spectra compatible with the dark matter relic density constraint .",

    "this on the other hand leads to a large amount of @xmath135 coannihilation .",

    "this consists of both types of coannihilation zones , namely , the chargino as well as the stau coannihilation zones .",

    "eq.([maeqn ] ) means @xmath74 needs to be a positive quantity less than unity .",

    "<S> we revisit the issue of considering stochasticity of grassmannian coordinates in @xmath0 superspace , which was analyzed previously by kobakhidze _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. in this stochastic supersymmetry(susy ) framework , the soft susy breaking terms of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) such as the bilinear higgs mixing , trilinear coupling as well as the gaugino mass parameters are all proportional to a single mass parameter @xmath1 , a measure of supersymmetry breaking arising out of stochasticity . while a nonvanishing trilinear coupling at the high scale is a natural outcome of the framework , a favorable signature for obtaining the lighter higgs boson mass @xmath2 at 125 gev , the model produces tachyonic sleptons or staus turning to be too light . </S>",
    "<S> the previous analyses took @xmath3 , the scale at which input parameters are given , to be larger than the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath4 in order to generate acceptable scalar masses radiatively at the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> still this was inadequate for obtaining @xmath2 at 125 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we find that higgs at 125 gev is highly achievable provided we are ready to accommodate a nonvanishing scalar mass soft susy breaking term similar to what is done in minimal anomaly mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) in contrast to a pure amsb setup . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the model can easily accommodate higgs data , lhc limits of squark masses , wmap data for dark matter relic density , flavor physics constraints and xenon100 data . </S>",
