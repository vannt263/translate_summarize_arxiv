    "besides their young age , the peculiar orbital distribution of these stars also provides clues to their formation mechanism and the dynamical structure in the gc .",

    "for example , in the in - spiraling star cluster scenario , the interactions between the central imbh and the stripped young stars have been studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although they were able to simulate the orbital features of stars on the thin disk , they had difficulties to account for the kinematic properties of those stars with eccentric orbits in the counterclockwise rotating disk . in this paper ,",
    "we propose a dynamical model to account for the orbital distribution of the sub - parsec young stars in the gc . rather than simultaneously investigating the formation mechanism of these young stars and their orbital distribution",
    ", we assume that all the sub - parsec young stars were formed in a clockwise rotating disk initially ( e.g. , due to instability or fragmentation of a massive accretion disk ) with small eccentricities .",
    "we show in   [ sec : timescales ] that , an isolated stellar disk by itself is unlikely to evolve from the presumed circular orbits in a thin disk to the currently observed multi - component orbital configuration .",
    "this inference is based on the determination that the timescale ( e.g. , the two - body relaxation timescale and the resonant relaxation timescale ) for a single stellar disk to relax with respect to the background stars is usually substantially longer than the age of the young stars .",
    "thus , the life - long eccentricity growth of the disk stars due to interactions among the stars is insignificant ( not substantially larger than 0.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the existence of young stars with high eccentricities and high inclination angles relative to the inner stellar disk requires an explanation , at least in the disk formation scenario of the young stars in the gc .",
    "it is entirely plausible that , under the action of dynamical friction , a ( dark ) star cluster and/or an imbh occasionally sink into the proximity of the gc .",
    "the ( dark ) star cluster ( which may also have a central imbh ) or the imbh plays the role of a massive perturber ( or intruder ) , spiraling inward , inducing asymmetric perturbation of the gravitational potential and exerting torques on the disk stars . interactions between the perturber and the disk stars , through either close encounters or some resonant interactions , may change the orbital distribution of the young stars .",

    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f2 ] , for a perturber with mass @xmath83 and located at a relatively large galactocentric distance ( @xmath84 ; blue lines ) , the precession timescales in some region ( @xmath85 ) may be smaller than the stellar age for some values of @xmath75 and the orbital inclinations of the stars in this region may have substantial variations due to the nodal precession ; but the precession timescale at @xmath86 is generally much longer than the stellar age and the initial coplanar structure of the inner disk can be well preserved for any values of @xmath75 . if the perturber is located at a smaller galactocentric distance ( @xmath87 ; red lines ) , the nodal precession timescale of the young stars at @xmath88 is much shorter than or comparable with their age if @xmath75 is in the range @xmath891080(or @xmath89100170 ) ; thus the orbital inclinations of the stars not only in the outer region @xmath890.150.5@xmath90 but also in the inner disk may have substantial variations or a warpness may be developed in the stellar disk due to the nodal precession ( these qualitative estimates are confirmed by direct numerical calculations of the stellar orbital motion in   [ subsec : migration ] ) . if the perturber s orbit is almost perpendicular to the initial disk plane ( red long - dashed line ) , the precession timescale for the young stars in the inner region is long enough compared to their age , and thus the inner disk may be not affected by the precession and its initial coplanar structure can be preserved .",
    "if the perturber orbit is nearly parallel to the disk plane , as mentioned in the paragraph above , although figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows that the precession timescale is short compared to the stellar age , the disk configuration in the inner region may still be preserved since the oscillation of the normal to the stellar orbital planes around the normal to the perturber orbital plane is small .",

    ", we assume the perturber to be an imbh with a point mass potential .",

    "most particles with initial semimajor axes larger than @xmath164 are captured into 2:1 resonance during the early stages of the perturber s evolution but they are released from the resonance and attained irregular orbits after the perturber has migrated inside @xmath157 .",

    "we also calculate the orbital distributions of the particles if their initial inclination angles to the perturber s orbital plane @xmath124 are in the range 2030 , 110120 , and 170180 , respectively . for the cases of initial @xmath179",

    "if the perturber has a smaller mass and migrates to a relatively outer position ( e.g. , @xmath182 and @xmath167 ) , the angles @xmath168 of the inner stars can be small ( e.g. , @xmath183 ) , but a warpness may be developed in the disk ( the warpness is not indicated by observations so far ) . for the case of initial @xmath179 $ ] ( see fig .

    "a relatively higher perturber mass may increase the excited eccentricities due to close encounters , but it also induces larger nodal precession of stars at the inner radii .    for the case of",

    "the angles @xmath168 of the stars with large initial semimajor axes ( e.g. , @xmath186 ) can be excited up to @xmath181 , and their eccentricities can also be excited up .",
    "but many excited particles have large @xmath187 ( e.g. , @xmath188 ) and the excited eccentricity @xmath162 of the particles at @xmath189 are not high enough ( e.g. , @xmath190 ) compared to the observations shown in figure [ fig : f3 ] . in this case , both of the inclination and eccentricity excitations come mainly from close encounters with the perturber .",
    "if the perturber is a dark cluster ( with a central imbh ) , its orbital decay may be accompanied with mass loss induced by the strong external tidal potential .",
    "our simulations indicate that for the same initial perturber mass , a decrease in the perturber mass during its orbital decay may make the inner stellar disk more likely to be preserved .",
    "we also test the effects of different perturber - migration timescales . for longer migration timescales ( e.g. , @xmath191 or @xmath118 ) ,",
    "the main results are generally not affected .",
    "note that a very large ( @xmath192 ) migration timescale is not compatible with the estimated age of the young stars . for a substantially shorter migration timescale ( e.g. , @xmath193 ) ,",
    "the inward - migration of the perturber is too fast for some particles to be captured into the mean - motion resonance and the excitation of the eccentricity and inclination becomes insufficient .",
    "the numerical models in ",
    "[ subsec : migration ] simulate the interaction between a disk of stars with nearly circular orbits and an inward - migrating perturber .",
    "provided the perturber s orbit is either nearly coplanar ( in corotating directions ) or essentially overhead , the young stars at the outer region generally attain high eccentricities ( up to unity ) , while those at the inner region retain low eccentricities .",
    "in addition , the young stars at the outer region tend to have a large range of inclination angle relative to the disk , while those in the inner region roughly remain in the initial disk ( see panels a and b in figs .",
    "[ fig : distr ] and [ fig : distrinc90 ] ) .",
    "these features are consistent with the observed features of the orbits partly listed in the items ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in order to make a quantitative comparison with observations , we plot the eccentricities of the young stars in the gc versus their observed distance to the central mbh in figure  [ fig : f3 ] ( the data are adopted from @xcite ) .",
    "this figure indeed indicates a correlation that the stars in the outlying regions of gc have high eccentricities ( close to 1 ) while the inner ones only have moderate eccentricities .",
    "this apparent correlation is reproduced in our model as shown in panel ( a ) in figures [ fig : distr ] and [ fig : distrinc90 ] .",
    "note that the low eccentricity of the test particles in the inner region ( with @xmath194 ) preserved ( panel a in figs .",
    "[ fig : distr ] and [ fig : distrinc90 ] ) , which appears inconsistent with the observational range of @xmath195 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "however , the eccentricities of the young stars at the inner region may relax to the observed values due to the interactions among the stars as shown in @xcite , which are not considered in   [ sec : model ] .",
    "an n - body numerical simulation of the model proposed in this paper would provide a quantitative consistency check .",
    "our calculations in   [ subsec : migration ] show that the inclination of the stars in the outer region relative to the inner disk is less excited for a nearly coplanar perturber orbit ( only up to @xmath196 ) than for an overhead perturber orbit .",
    "the inclination angles of the outer stars are not well determined in observations , but if they have higher inclinations ( e.g. , @xmath197 in item a in the ",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , the perturber would be more likely to be on an overhead orbit .",
    "precise determination of the inclination of the stars in the outer region will be important to distinguish the inclinations of the perturber .    in the in - spiraling - cluster scenario ( briefly discussed in   [ sec : intro ] to account for the origin of the young stars ) , we note that , within a limited dispersion , the eccentricities of the tidally disrupted stars are usually comparable to that of the in - spiraling star cluster . the dominant component of the velocity vector of the dispersed stars is their co - moving motion with the cluster and the velocity of the stars relative to the center of the cluster is relatively small @xcite . therefore , it is unlikely that the observed eccentricity distribution of the young stars shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] can be produced by a disrupted single in - spiraling young star cluster . in order to reproduce the observed velocity distribution ,",
    "the disruption of a second hypothetical in - spiraling young star cluster may be required ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a scenario seems contrived because the coeval nature of the young stars also requires these clusters to be formed simultaneously .",
    "the model we analyzed here is different from that two in - spiraling star cluster scenario . in our model ,",
    "all the young stars are initially in a single disk and then the orbits of the young stars in the outer region of the disk are perturbed by an inward - migrating ( dark ) star cluster or an imbh onto high eccentricity and high inclination orbits .    figures [ fig : distr ] , [ fig : distrinc90 ] and [ fig : distrinc30rp0.3 ] ( e ) and ( f ) indicate one of the features of our model that because they are captured into mean - motion resonance , some test particles have nearly the same semimajor axes with widely different eccentricities .",
    "the particles captured into the resonance are likely to have close encounters with each other , which should modify the orbital distribution obtained here .",
    "our preliminary n - body results show that some of the particles captured into the mean - motion resonance may then be scattered out of the resonance . nevertheless , a substantial number of particles still attached to the resonance . the main conclusion derived in figs .",
    "[ fig : distr ] and  [ fig : distrinc90 ] are not expected to change significantly .",
    "the existence of resonant stars , if can be extracted from the observational data , would not only provide an important check for our model but also strongly signify the possible presence of an imbh in the gc .",
    "our simulation results show that the inclination angles of the young stars at the outer region of the initial disk may be excited up to different values as the perturber migrating inward .",
    "the excited stars can not form a coherent secondary disk in this model .",
    "the formation of a secondary disk is also challenging in the in - spiraling cluster scenario @xcite . in any event",
    ", observational evidence of the existence of a secondary disk remains controversial .",
    "we studied the dynamical evolution of a young stellar disk surrounding the mbh in the gc and perturbed by an inward migrating imbh or a ( dark ) star cluster hosting an imbh .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the orbits of the young stars in the disk may be significantly modified from the outside in by the perturber .",
    "if the perturber has a low inclination angle to the initial disk , its migration from a region outside to @xmath11 may excite the eccentricities ( up to unity ) and the inclination angles of stars in the outer ( 0.20.5 ) regions by capturing them into its mean - motion and secular resonances , forcing them to migrate with it , and/or closely encountered with them .",
    "stars interior to this region preserve their initial coplanar structure .",
    "the overall dynamical distribution of the stars reproduces that observed on sub - parsec scale around the gc , i.e. , an inner disk surrounded by a torus of highly eccentric and inclined stars .",
    "if the perturber migrates to @xmath198 on an orbit which is nearly perpendicular to the initial disk , the stars in the outer regions can still be excited to highly eccentric and inclined orbits through resonant capture and nodal precession induced by and close encounters with the perturber .",
    "the inclinations can be excited to be in a larger range in the perpendicular case than those excited in the low - inclination case . in the perpendicular case",
    ", the stars in the inner region can also retain their low eccentricities and remain on the initial disk .",
    "these results reproduce many features of the observed orbital distribution of sub - parsec young stars .",
    "note that the predicted position for the perturber here is an instantaneous value , and the perturber does not necessarily stop there but continues to migrate inward under the action of dynamical friction with time going on .",
    "further measurements of the orbital parameters of the young stars in the gc ( e.g. , semimajor axes , eccentricities , and inclination angles ) would provide important tests for the model proposed in this paper .",
    "it would also be useful to distinguish various scenarios proposed to account for the formation of the young stars .",
