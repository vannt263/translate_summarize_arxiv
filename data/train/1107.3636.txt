    "nowadays , global positioning system ( gps ) chips are ubiquitous , and continue to be embedded in a variety of devices .",
    "a gps device allows to determine its location with about @xmath0 meters accuracy , by measuring the propagation delay of signals transmitted by the set of gps satellites in the field of view ( fov ) of any receiver located on the surface of the earth , which typically requires measurements from at least four satellites @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the signal that arrives at the receiver is downconverted , match - filtered and oversampled at a fast rate .",
    "subsequently , the receiver acquires enough ( at least four ) strong signals by exploiting the orthogonality of the distinct _ coarse / acquisition _ ( c / a ) codes used in gps signaling at each satellite @xcite .",
    "however , due to the unknown propagation delays , the samples obtained are misaligned in time and frequency and therefore , it is vital to pinpoint the code - phase in order to decode the navigation data correctly @xcite@xcite and use the time - delay information for pseudo - range computation",
    ". furthermore , each of the satellites contributes a component of the received gps signal that is characterized by a distinct doppler offset @xcite , due to the unequal relative velocity of satellite and receiver , as well as the offset of the different local oscillators at the gps receivers . in general , time - frequency synchronization as well as signal detection is tackled in gps receivers during the _ acquisition / detection _ stage via a parallel search over the binned delay - doppler space across all the satellite c / a codes @xcite@xcite .    in many practical scenarios ,",
    "signals might arrive at the receiver with multipath components instead of the line of sight ( los ) component @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "constructive and destructive superposition of randomly delayed and faded replicas , leads to distorted correlation peaks .",
    "this is usually tackled in the _ tracking stage _",
    "@xcite that follows the _ acquisition / detection _ stage , by using an _ early - late _ receiver .",
    "such a receiver compares the energy of a symbol period in the first half from the early gate to the energy in the last half from the late gate so that the receiver can synchronize the signals accordingly .",
    "furthermore , many approaches , in addition to the early - late structure , have been proposed to better mitigate the effects brought by multipath , including ( but not limited to ) the narrow correlator @xcite , multipath eliminating technique ( met ) @xcite , and multipath estimating delay lock loop ( medll ) @xcite .",
    "these methods differ in their capabilities to remove multipath errors , specifically at low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and/or in the presence of interference . in this work",
    ", we consider the general signal model that considers multipath effects and propose an acquisition scheme that coarsely captures significant paths for each active satellite , with its corresponding code - phase and doppler .",
    "the tracking stage that further resolves the estimates of delay - doppler pairs as well as the multipath components is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as described above , the acquisition and detection of gps signals is usually performed sequentially .",
    "first , the strongest signals coming from the satellites are detected by searching a binned delay - doppler space via exhaustive correlations that pinpoint the correct coarse timing information and frequency offsets .",
    "after acquisition and detection , the signal is locked and the device enters the tracking stage that tackles fine synchronization and multipath error mitigation in order to despread , demodulate and decode the navigation data correctly in real - time .",
    "however , this acquisition / detection scheme can be computationally intensive due to the large number of correlations , and especially the exhaustive search for peaks over the binned delay - doppler space across all the satellite signals with distinct c / a codes .",
    "for example , the maximum doppler shift in a gps signal is typically within @xmath1 $ ] and the search step size is usually @xmath2hz while the maximum delay can run up to a c / a code length @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the 2-d delay - doppler peak is found by comparing the outputs of @xmath4 correlators for each satellite , which is a heavy computation burden .    _ paper contributions : _ in order to scale down the operations and hardware requirements",
    ", we propose a simple and efficient acquisition scheme based on the recently developed compressed sensing ( cs ) framework @xcite and its extension to analog signals @xcite .",
    "the multichannel samplers in @xcite are constructed as a randomized linear combination of the duals of all the generators , where the generators in this case correspond to the satellite - specfic c / a code waveforms . in our context",
    ", we show that the the duals of the generators are well approximated by the generators themselves .",
    "this alleviates one of the most difficult aspects in the practical application of @xcite , namely , the physical implementation of the dual filters , by exploiting properties of the spread spectrum sequences that are in the gps standard . thanks to this interpretation , the proposed multichannel samplers can be viewed as performing independent random projections of all correlators outputs .",
    "the resulting set of compressive measurements are then used together to recover the peaks located sparsely over the delay - doppler space , which is a jointly sparse recovery problem with infinite input vectors and infinite measurement vectors ( imv ) . the continuous - to - finite ( ctf ) method introduced in @xcite",
    "effectively reduces the imv problem to a finite multiple measurement vector ( mmv ) system with jointly sparse inputs , which can be solved efficiently using the reduce mmv and boost ( rembo ) technique proposed in @xcite , or other mmv approaches @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the general model for gps signals .",
    "section 3 re - interprets existing gps acquisition schemes from a sampling point of view . in order to scale down the computations and hardware requirements ,",
    "section 4 introduces the analog cs framework . in section 5",
    "we further reduce the general solution to a set of simple compressive samplers by utilizing the structure of gps signals .",
    "numerical results are shown in section 6 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed acquisition scheme , followed by a complexity analysis given in section 7 .",
    "finally the paper is concluded in section 8 .",

    "in fact , by the gps transmission standards we have @xmath30 for the gps @xmath5-c / a signal , i.e. @xmath31ms .    the correlation properties of the spreading code are vital in the recovery of spread spectrum signals .",
