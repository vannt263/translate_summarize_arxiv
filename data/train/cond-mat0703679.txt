    "the 3d confinement and nearly perfect isolation from its environment given in self - assemble semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) leads to `` atom like '' electronic structure features manifested , among others , by @xmath6ev photoluminescence ( pl ) line widths and a long coherence time .",
    "such narrow and isolated levels open the way for potential applications using as single - photon emitters @xcite and quantum - entangled sources .",
    "@xcite at the same time , this allows fundamental studies of @xmath6ev - scale fine - structure splitting @xcite of exciton lines due to the electron - hole exchange interaction , spectral shift due to charged excitons @xcite as well as multi - exciton formation and decay .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of the traditional far - field spectroscopy is limited to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavelength of the probing light , @xcite much larger than the typical sizes of quantum dots ( a few tens to about a hundred nanometers ) .",
    "recently , it became possible to exam the inner structures of an exciton in the qds , and map out its spatial distribution , using the near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom or snom ) .",
    "@xcite in the far field measurement , the transition intensity ( within single - particle approximation ) is proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the conduction and valence band wavefunctions , respectively .",
    "while in the far field measurements , the extent of the incident electromagnetic wave is such that its magnitude over the entire dot region can be safely taken as constant , in the near - field , the electromagnetic profile of the tip @xmath12 , has an extent comparable to the size of the nanostructure and must be explicitly taken into account : @xmath13 in this case , the transition intensity is modulated by the shape of the external field , i.e. , proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the resolution of nsom can thus be much higher than @xcite @xmath7 , providing details on how the carriers are distributed in the quantum dots .    in a qd ,",
    "the electron and hole wavefunctions can be approximated by products of envelope functions and bloch functions . in the far field measurement ,",
    "the interband transitions obey two kinds of selection rules : one related to the bloch part of the wavefunctions , and one to the envelope component of the wavefunctions .",
    "for example , from the four possible @xmath15 excitonic transitions , two are bright and two are dark .",
    "the dark transitions are forbidden because the total angular momentum from the electron and hole _ bloch functions _ parts sum up to two , and can hence not be carried out by a single photon .",
    "in contrast , all of the eight @xmath16 transitions are forbidden because a photon does not couple effectively to the _ envelope _ orbital angular momentum of the exciton . however , in nsom , where the electromagnetic field is applied inhomogeneously only to a part of the dot , the global spatial symmetry is broken , thus altering the selection rules for the envelope functions and allowing transitions that are forbidden in far field measurement .",
    "@xcite we show here that the @xmath16 transitions ( which are far - field forbidden ) have comparable intensities in nsom to the @xmath15 transitions .",
    "furthermore , nsom provides additional far - field allowed information about the bloch part of the wavefunctions , while the far field spectroscopy is lacking .",
    "for example , by comparing the transition intensities of different polarizations , one could determine the relative phase between @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of the hole wavefunctions at each point .",
    "in contrast , in the far field measurements , only the total polarization is measured and the wavefunction phase information of the bloch part is lost .    recently , matuda et al .",
