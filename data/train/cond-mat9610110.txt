    "the electron capture represents the transition of an electron from the state above the barrier into a bound state in the quantum well ( qw ) . in a qw laser",

    "the difference between the electron and hole capture times tends to diminish during the capture process @xcite due to an electron - hole attraction and due to the ambipolar character of the capture .",
    "minimization of the electron capture time can be achieved mainly by optimizing the qw width and depth . while the capture due to the electron - polar optical phonon ( e - pop ) interaction is dominant outside the oscillation minima , in the minima the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction can play an important role @xcite and becomes dominant for high enough electron densities . increasing influence of the e - e capture with increasing electron density in the qw",

    "the decrease of the e - pop capture time to its oscillation minima is smooth even when the first minimum appears .",
    "the e - pop capture time curve does not show a resonant drop for the qw widths near the resonances , because the barrier electrons occupy the states below the threshold for the pop emission and can not be scattered into the subband which is in the resonance with the top of the qw .",
    "a further increase of the qw width shifts the resonant subband deeper into the qw and the e - pop scattering into this subband smoothly increases .",
    "the exception is a monoenergetic distribution with the energy close to the pop energy . in such case the e - pop scattering into the resonance subband",

    "a direct comparison of our total electron capture time with the experiments @xcite is not possible because we use the step distribution function for an active laser regime .",
    "nevertheless , we have obtained the resonances in the capture time oscillations by the same qw width as resonances measured in the experiments .",
    "the direct comparison requires to take into account the ambipolar capture time which can only be calculated when the hole capture time is fitted to the experimental data @xcite .    to directly detect the e - e capture time it is necessary to suppress the e - pop interaction .",
    "a proper structure for the e - pop interaction suppression is the structure with the qw depth smaller than the pop energy .",
    "if in the time - resolved optical experiment @xcite such structure would be irradiated by a short laser pulse , the excited carriers above the barrier would thermalize to the boltzmann distribution with the electron temperature @xmath99 during several picoseconds @xcite and after that they would be captured via the e - e interaction into the qw .",

    "in this calculation the distribution function @xmath35 in the capture time formula ( [ captime ] ) is taken as the boltzmann distribution function at the electron temperature @xmath101 .",
    "this choice corresponds to the assumption that the electrons are optically excited only a few mev above the @xmath11 barrier .",
    "figure  7 also shows that the e - e capture dominates if the qw depth is less than @xmath102 ev .",

    "[ preisel ] , the e - e capture time is of similar importance as the e - pop capture time for higher electron densities although it was calculated including the degeneracy and exchange effect in the e - e interaction which increases the capture time by about two times .    outside the resonance the exchange increases the e - e capture time by about two times due to the following reasons . in case that both electrons are scattered into the same subband ( @xmath104 ) , all three terms in the substitution ( [ exch ] )",
    "have almost the same magnitude ( which we verify numerically ) because the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 are very close . in case that both electrons are scattered into different subbands ( @xmath107 ) ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account that the substitution ( [ exch ] ) is summed in the formulae ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ captime ] ) over the final states @xmath24 and @xmath26 . in the sum the terms with final states",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 can be rewritten as @xmath110 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\frac{{|f_{ijnm } ( q')|}^2}{{q'}^2 \\epsilon ( q')^2 } + \\frac{{|f_{ijmn } ( q')|}^2}{{q'}^2 \\epsilon ( q')^2 } \\right ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\frac{f_{ijmn } ( q ) f_{ijnm } ( q ' ) } { q \\epsilon ( q ) q ' \\epsilon ( q ' ) } + \\frac{f_{ijnm } ( q ) f_{ijmn } ( q ' ) } { q \\epsilon ( q ) q ' \\epsilon ( q ' ) } \\right ] \\label{sumex } \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all three terms in eq .",

    "consequently , the presence of the third ( interference ) term decreases the value of the expression ( [ sumex ] ) two times in comparison with the case when the exchange effect ( i. e. , the interference term ) is neglected",
    ". finally , in the resonance the exchange increases the capture time only by @xmath4% .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the resonance the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 strongly differ and the interference term becomes much smaller than direct terms .",
    "the effect of degeneracy on the capture time is negligible when the difference between the lowest energy subband above the barrier and the highest energy subband in the qw is large compared to the quasi - fermi energy of the electrons in the qw . in such case most of final states in the qw are unoccupied and the e - e capture times with and without degeneracy are quite close . near the resonance , when the highest energy subband in the qw is close to the lowest subband above the barrier , the degeneracy strongly reduces the number of available final states despite the fact that the highest subband is essentially unoccupied .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electron captured in the highest subband of the qw can exchange only a small amount of energy with the scattering partner in the lowest subband of the qw .",
    "the available final states of the scattering partner are therefore blocked by the @xmath17-k fermi distribution in the qw .",
    "the e - h , e - e and e - pop capture times have been calculated in the schqw for the carrier density @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "all three capture times oscillate as a function of the qw width with the same period but with very different amplitudes .",
    "the e - h capture time is not only much greater than the e - pop capture time but also greater than the e - e capture time even for the qw widths near the resonance . in the resonance the e - e interaction plays a role together with the e - pop interaction and improves the capture efficiency of the qw @xcite .",
    "since the increase of the electron density decreases the e - e capture time , it is expected that the e - h capture time will decrease similarly .",
    "therefore , the influence of the e - h interaction should be considered only for high density and in resonances .",
    "we find that the electron capture time oscillates as a function of the depth and reaches the oscillation minimum when a new bound state merges into the qw . at the same time",
    "the effect of the degeneracy and exchange effect on the e - e capture time has been studied .",
    "the degeneracy increases the capture time approximately @xmath111% only in the resonant minima .",
    "the inclusion of the exchange effect into the e - e interaction increases the e - e capture time by about two times . to illustrate the quantitative importance of the exchange effect found in this paper , we mention that the quantitative changes due to the dynamic screening and coupling between electrons and phonons ( not considered in this work ) are much smaller @xcite",
    "therefore , the exchange effect should be considered in the e - e interaction induced capture .",
