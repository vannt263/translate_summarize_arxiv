    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is one of the most energetic phenomena in the universe .",
    "agns are essentially classified into two types ( type 1 and 2 ) based on whether or not broad lines such as , , and are observed . according to unified models of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this difference is due to the viewing angle of a dust torus , which surrounds a central supermassive black hole , accretion disc , and a region emitting broad lines ( broad line region ; blr ) , since light from the blr is blocked by the torus if viewed from an edge - on angle .",
    "this picture is supported by the findings of hidden polarized broad lines in the optical spectra of type 2 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studies based on population synthesis models of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) suggest that a significant fraction of type 2 agns have a line - of - sight hydrogen column density of @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the torus is optically thick for compton scattering ( compton thick ; ct ) .",
    "numerical simulations predict that most agns experience such heavily obscured phase in their early stage of growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to study these objects provides us fundamental information of the cosmic evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "recent x - ray observations find that there are ct absorbers in some type 1 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence the hydrogen column density is one of key parameters to characterize an agn as well as the black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "however , these sources are missed by observations below 10 kev due to the strong photoelectric absorption .",
    "sensitive hard x - ray observations above 10 kev , where the penetrating power overwhelms the absorption , are crucial for these sources .",
    "3c  345 ( @xmath7 ) is a type 1 quasar in the 3c catalogue @xcite referred to as core - dominated radio source since its high - frequency radio emission is dominated by a compact flat spectrum ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it was firstly detected as a 2-kev x - ray source by _",
    "@xcite found that the optical and infrared continua of the source show strong time variability on time scales of months .",
    "@xcite observed strong polarization and its large changes occurred on time scales of a week in the optical band .",
    "the apparent velocity of the jet component of the source is superluminal ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the supermassive black hole mass is estimated to be @xmath9 based on the h@xmath10 line width by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gcj01 ) .",
    "similarly , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s11 ) derived the black hole mass of @xmath11 and the eddington ratio of @xmath12 based on the h@xmath10 line width and its luminosity .",
    "recently , observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ hubble space telescope _ were performed @xcite to constrain the physical properties of the jet .",
    "while 3c  345 is intensively studied for its unique natures , there is no report of the existence of a ct absorber at this time ; i analysed archival data of 3c  345 obtained with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat by utilizing the numerical torus model provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter my09 ) and photo - ionization models computed with the xstar code @xcite , and found that this source is obscured by a ct material . in this paper , i present the results of a detailed analysis of the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat spectra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section - observation ] describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "firstly , i analyse the spectra with a conventional broken power law model in section [ section - broken - powerlaw ] .",
    "next , the spectra are analysed with torus absorption models in section [ section - torus - absorption ] .",
    "lastly , i present the results obtained with partial covering absorber models in section [ section - partial - covering ] .",
    "the discussion and summary follow section [ section - discussion ] and [ section - summary ] .",
    "i adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath13 , the photoelectric absorption cross - sections of @xcite ( ` vern ` in xspec ) , and the solar abundances of @xcite ( ` angr ` in xspec ) through the paper .",
    "the errors are 90% confidence limits for a single parameter .",
    "_ suzaku _ observed 3c  345 on 2012 september 11 with a net exposure of 12.7 ks .",
    "the data are public on the _ suzaku _ page on data archives and transmission system ( darts ) , and the observation i d is 707043010 .",
    "_ suzaku _ @xcite carries four x - ray ccd cameras called the x - ray image spectrometers ( xis-0 , xis-1 , xis-2 , and xis-3 ) , which cover the 0.212 kev band , as the focal plane imager of four x - ray telescopes , and non - imaging instrument called the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) consisting of si pin photo - diodes and gadolinium silicon oxide ( gso ) scintillation counters , which cover the 1070 kev and 40600 kev band , respectively .",
    "xis-0 , xis-2 , and xis-3 are front - side illuminated ccds ( fi - xiss ) , and xis-1 is the back - side illuminated one ( bi - xis ) . since xis-2 became inoperable on 2007",
    "november 7 @xcite , no xis-2 data is available .",
    "spaced - row charge injection ( sci ) was applied to the xis data to improve the energy resolution @xcite .",
    "3c  345 was observed at the xis nominal position . in the spectral analysis ,",
    "the 70-month ( between 2004 december and 2010 september ) integrated _ swift_/bat spectrum covering the 15200 kev band ( swift j1643.1 + 3951 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is utilized .",
    "the _ suzaku _ data are reduced with the heasoft version 6.18 and the latest version of caldb on 2016 february 24 .",
    "all event files are reprocessed with the ` aepipeline ` command , and the produced cleaned events are analysed .",
    "the light curves and spectra of xiss are extracted from a circular region with a @xmath14-radius around the detected position .",
    "the backgrounds are taken from a circular source - free region with a @xmath15-radius .",
    "the so - called `` tuned '' non - x - ray background ( nxb ) model provided by the hxd team is used for the hxd / pin data , whose systematic errors are estimated to be @xmath16 at a @xmath17 confidence level in the 1540 kev band for a 10 ks exposure @xcite . the cxb spectrum simulated with the hxd / pin response for a uniformly extended emission is added to the nxb spectrum .",
    "the hxd / gso data are not analysable since no background model is provided .      figure  [ figure - light - curve ] shows the background - subtracted light curves of 3c  345 obtained with the _ suzaku _ xis and hxd / pin in the 210 kev and 1540 kev band , respectively .",
    "the data from xis-0 and xis-3 are summed . to minimize any systematic uncertainties caused by the orbital change of the satellite , the data taken during one orbit ( @xmath18 96 minutes )",
    "are merged into one bin , and this yields 4 and 3 bins for xis and hxd / pin , respectively ; note that the hxd / pin observation started about 30 minutes after the xis observation started according to the fits headers . to check whether there are any significant time variabilities during the observation , i perform a simple @xmath19 test to each light curve , assuming a null hypothesis of constant flux .",
    "the resultant reduced @xmath19 value and the degrees of freedom are superimposed on figure  [ figure - light - curve ] .",
    "though the time variability in the xis can not be rejected at the 90% confidence level , the flux changes are marginal ; the one in the hxd / pin can be ruled out at the level .",
    "thus the time - averaged spectra over the entire observation are analysed .",
    "the spectra of fi - xiss are summed ; the data of the fi - xiss , bi - xis , hxd / pin , and _ swift_/bat in the energy band of 0.810.0 kev , 0.58.0 kev , 15 - 25 kev , and 15100 kev , respectively , are used , covering the 0.5100 kev band simultaneously .",
    "the relative normalization of the pin with respect to the fi - xiss is fixed at 1.16 based on the calibration of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "those of bi - xis and bat with respect to the fi - xiss are set as free parameters .",
    "galactic absorption is always included in all the models discussed in this paper ; its hydrogen column density is fixed at the value calculated with the ` nh ` command , @xmath20 , which is based on the result of the map @xcite .",

( 8) the observed flux in the 1050 kev band . ( 9 ) the 210 kev intrinsic luminosity corrected for the absorption . ( 10 ) the corrected akaile information criterion .",
    "the limitations of the * absori * model are that the cross - sections above 5 kev are simply approximated by @xmath22 , and that the absorber is in ionization equilibrium but not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "though the spectra of 3c  345 do not show any clear line features , i solve radiative transfer by utilizing the xstar code to draw the more realistic nature of the absorber .",
    "the version number of the code used here is 2.39 , which comes with the heasoft version 6.20 not with version 6.18 , since some fatal bugs were fixed in the heasoft version 6.19 and 6.20 ( see their release notes for detail ) .",
    "the mpi_xstar program is also employed for efficient usage of multi - core cpus .",
    "a spherical gas of uniform density is considered .",
    "the gas is assumed to be ionized by the nucleus at the centre with a single power law spectrum of a photon index of @xmath23 .",
    "the covering fraction is fixed at 100% , and let it free to vary in xspec later by adding a normalization parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the turbulence velocity of the gas is set to be @xmath25 .",
    "iterative calculations are performed until the gas is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the results are compiled into three table models which xspec can read by the ` xstar2table ` program ; only a table named ` xout_mtable.fits ` , which contains the absorption spectrum in the transmitted direction , is used in this sub - subsection . when this component is expressed as @xmath26 ( the subscript `` @xmath27 '' represents the density of the gas ) , the photon spectrum of the model thought here is written as @xmath28 and * const*mtable\\{xout_mtable.fits}zpowerlw + const*zpowerlw * in the xspec terminology .",
    "again , @xmath29 is fixed at 1.69 .",
    "note that compton scattering is not taken into account in the xstar code .",
    "the minuit migrad method is applied here for the fitting algorithm .",
    "three cases of gas density are computed : @xmath30 .",
    "these are referred to as model g@xmath31 , g@xmath32 , and g@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are summarized in table  [ table - model - g ] .",
    "figure  [ figure - spectrum - model - g ] shows the model spectrum of model g@xmath31 .",
    "overall , the ionization parameters and the line - of - sight column density of model g@xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are larger than those of model f@xmath36 .",
    "the higher a gas is ionized , the more it becomes transparent since electrons in atoms are more weakly bound and can move about freely . thus this tendency ( a higher ionization parameter leads to a higher column density ) qualitatively seems correct . on the other hand ,",
    "the column densities are so high that these models are not strictly accurate .",
    "i fitted the observed spectra of 3c  345 with 7 different models in this paper .",
    "one of them ( model a ) is a simple broken power model , two of them ( model b and c ) are the torus absorption models , and four of them ( model d , e@xmath37 , f@xmath37 , g@xmath34 ) are the partial covering absorber models . since model a has no advantage over the other models due to its relatively large @xmath38 value , it is not discussed below .    when model b and c are compared , while the @xmath38 values are comparable , model c is physically valid even for ct cases .",
    "thus i choose model c as a best - fitting model . while model d gives us the smallest @xmath38 of the partial covering absorber models , the result that a nearly full - coverage ( @xmath39 ) absorber is in our line of sight conflicts with the assumption that the absorber is not a torus but a cloud . in model e@xmath36",
    ", we expect that the spectral shape can be accounted for by a strong compton reflection component of the accretion disc or clouds in the blr , and that the line - of - sight hydrogen column density should be rather small . however , the results lead to a very large column density of @xmath0 and a very weak compton reflection component of @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the results conflict with the assumptions .",
    "when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are assumed ( model e@xmath43 ) , a rather strong reflection component is allowed ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "however , this model is not favoured due to the large @xmath38 value . though model f@xmath36 reproduces the shape of the observed spectra well , there are some limitations due to the * absori * model . in that sense ,",
    "model g@xmath34 are more appropriate than model f@xmath36 since it takes radiative transfer into account and the absorber is in ionization and thermal equilibrium though compton scattering process is not considered .",
    "thus i also choose model g@xmath34 as another best - fitting model .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsection - data - reduction ] , the nxb model for the hxd / pin has systematic errors of @xmath16 at a @xmath17 confidence level in the 1540 kev band for a 10 ks exposure @xcite , which is almost same as the _ suzaku _ observation of 3c  345 . to evaluate the impact of this uncertainty on my spectral fitting ,",
    "i create a nxb model where count rate in each energy bin is gained 3% , conservatively , from the original `` tuned '' nxb model .",
    "this new nxb model is added to the cxb model spectrum used in section [ subsection - data - reduction ] , and applied to the hxd / pin spectrum , which is simultaneously fitted with model c together with the xis and _ swift_/bat spectra .",
    "the resultant best - fitting parameters except for the relative normalization of the _ swift_/bat with respect to the fi - xiss @xmath45 fall within their original 90% statistical errors ; @xmath45 changes from 0.47 to 0.55 .",
    "similarly , i also create a nxb model whose count rate is reduced by 3% , and then apply it to the observed hxd / pin spectrum , this yielding consistent best - fitting parameters with their original values within 90% confidence limits .",
    "likewise , the uncertainty of the hxd / pin nxb model is also investigated for model g@xmath34 .",
    "the covering fraction @xmath24 absolutely changes by 5% ( @xmath46 , for example ) , and the normalization of _",
    "swift_/bat relative to the fi - xiss @xmath45 also changes by 0.1 .",
    "the other parameters fall within the 90% confidence limits of their original values .",
    "hence i conclude that the systematic uncertainty of the hxd / pin nxb model does not affect our arguments .",
    "the results fitted with model c suggest that 3c  345 is a ct - agn with a strong scattered ( unabsorbed ) component of @xmath47 , which corresponds to the upper limit of the typical values of seyfert 2 galaxies ( 310% , * ? ? ?",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , spectral fitting of bright unobscured sources are sometimes misidentified as ct - agns with a strong scattered component and a weak underlying torus component .",
    "hence the authors introduced an upper limit of 10% of scattered component into their ct sample selection .",
    "the @xmath48 value of model c falls just on this border line , and it is not rejected at this point .",
    "a possible explanation to account for the strong scattered component of this source is that the torus is more gaseous and less dusty than typical type 2 agns , and incident photons from the central engine are scattered in our direction by the gas by thomson scattering .",
    "however , we have to accept the strange `` facts '' that 3c  345 is type 1 in the optical band but is type 2 in the x - ray band , and that the torus is viewed from a completely edge - on angle in addition .",
    "the relative normalization of the _ swift_/bat spectrum with respect to the fi - xiss is @xmath49 for all the models except for model e@xmath43 , which is found to be inappropriate for 3c  345 .",
    "that is , there is time variability between the _ swift_/bat and _ suzaku _ observations , and the flux observed with _",
    "suzaku _ is twice as high as that extrapolated from the _",
    "swift_/bat spectrum .",
    "since the optical data are compared to the x - ray ones , this correction is always considered below .",
    "gcj01 derived the supermassive black hole mass of 3c  345 of @xmath9 based on the h@xmath10 line width .",
    "s11 also derived the mass of @xmath11 and the eddington ratio @xmath50 by utilizing the optical h@xmath10 line width and its luminosity in the spectrum of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "both authors used the same indicator but obtained different masses .",
    "this can be due to their samples .",
    "while gcj01 focused on radio - loud quasars , s11 handled all sdss quasars .",
    "firstly , i discuss the eddington ratio @xmath51 derived from the x - ray luminosity with model c. the absorption and time variability corrected 210 kev band luminosity is @xmath52 .",
    "the bolometric correction for the x - ray luminosity by @xcite yields a bolometric luminosity of @xmath53 .",
    "since the eddington luminosity based on s11 is @xmath54 , the eddington ratio derived from the x - ray luminosity is estimated to be @xmath55 ( super - eddington ) , 6 times higher than that derived from the optical spectrum . when the black hole mass derived by gcj01 is applied , the eddington luminosity is @xmath56 , and the eddington ratio is @xmath57 .",
    "thus model c is unlikely to explain the optical observations .",
    "next , i investigate model g@xmath31 as an example of model g@xmath34 similarly .",
    "the 210 kev band luminosity is @xmath58 , and the bolometric luminosity is @xmath59 .",
    "the eddington ratio based on the black hole mass by s11 is @xmath60 .",
    "however , @xmath61 yields a black hole mass of @xmath62 , which is smaller than that by gcj01 .",
    "thus model g@xmath34 are likely to explain the optical spectrum .",
    "when the fact that there is no fe k@xmath63 line and k absorption edge in the x - ray spectrum of 3c  345 is also considered , the best - fitting model for this source is likely to be model g@xmath34 .",
    "a calculation of the 210 kev band luminosity of the unabsorbed component in model c yields @xmath64 .",
    "the bolometric correction for this luminosity by @xcite gives us @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath61 is assumed , we obtain the black hole mass of @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "interestingly , this value is slightly smaller than the lower limit of the black hole mass by s11 .",
    "@xcite suggested that there is a supermassive black hole binary with an equal mass of @xmath68 and the separation of @xmath69 in 3c  345 based on the time variability in the optical and radio bands and the precession of the jet .",
    "the black hole mass obtained above is 1.5 times as heavy as that by @xcite , but their scenario seems attractive for model c. let us assume that both black holes have their own accretion discs and dust tori , and that one of them is a heavily absorbed ct - agn with a type 2 nucleus with a completely edge - on viewing angle of the torus and lies behind the other one with a type 1 nucleus .",
    "an example of such systems is cid-42 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the type 2 nucleus in the 210 kev band is dominated by that of the type 1 nucleus due to the strong photoelectric absorption , thus the sign of the type 2 nucleus is missed in @xmath70-kev observations , but detected in @xmath71-kev observations .",
    "this could be the case for the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat spectra , and could explain the strange nature that this source is type 1 in the optical band but type 2 in the x - ray band , and the torus is viewed from a completely edge - on angle .",
    "furthermore , if the type 2 nucleus belongs to `` hidden '' population @xcite , it is hard to detect it in the optical band since the flux of the [ ] line is too weak .",
    "i have no evidence to prove this scenario at this time .",
    "even if this is the case , the confirmation is very challenging even for future missions and telescopes .",
    "however , a search for an offset [ ] line with respect to the source redshift could be worth doing .",
    "the archival data of 3c  345 obtained with _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat are analysed . in previous studies ,",
    "the x - ray spectra below 10 kev of this source were fitted with a simple broken power law model without absorption , but i found that the spectrum above 10 kev is unexpectedly stronger than that predicted by the one below 10 kev . since such spectral shape can be explained by the strong photoelectric absorption and compton scattering in a dense material generally , models for compton thick agns and partial covering absorbers in seyfert 1 galaxies were applied to the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat spectra .    the numerical torus model by my09 , which represents the absorbed transmitted component and reflection by the torus , suggests that this source can be a compton thick agn with the hydrogen column density of the torus of @xmath72 , the inclination angle of @xmath73 , and a relatively strong scattered component for typical type 2 agns of @xmath47 .",
    "however , the comparison of the eddington ratio derived from the 210 kev band luminosity to that of the sdss spectrum indicates that this source is shining at a super eddington luminosity , and this model seems inappropriate except for the possibility that 3c  345 is a binary system of supermassive black holes suggested by @xcite .",
    "the partial covering ionized absorber model proposes that this source is a hard excess agn with the very large absorbing column density of @xmath2 , the ionization parameter of @xmath74 , and the covering fraction of @xmath4 . though the 210 kev band luminosity requires a relatively large black hole mass of @xmath5 , which is heavier than that estimated from the sdss spectrum , but it is consistent with another optical observation .",
    "thus this model is likely to the best - fitting model for 3c  345 .    to my knowledge ,",
    "3c  345 is the most distant and most absorbed hard excess agn .",
    "further detailed observations of this source at multi - wavelengths would give us a deeper understanding of hard excess agns and the cosmic evolution of supermassive black holes .",

    "<S> however , this model fails to account for the eddington ratio obtained with the optical observations by @xcite and @xcite , or requires the existence of a supermassive black hole binary , which was suggested by @xcite , thus this model is likely to be inappropriate for 3c  345 . a partial covering ionized absorber model which accounts for absorption in `` hard excess '' type 1 agns </S>",
    "<S> is also applied , and finds a compton thick absorber with the column density of @xmath2 , the ionization parameter of @xmath3 , and the covering fraction of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> since this model obtains a black hole mass of @xmath5 , which is consistent with the optical observation by @xcite , this model is likely to be the best - fitting model of this source . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that 3c  345 is the most distant and most obscured hard excess agn at this time .    </S>",
