    "for an integer @xmath8 , let a bounded @xmath0 domain @xmath1 , functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 be given .",
    "we study a two - player zero - sum stochastic differential game ( sdg ) , defined in terms of an @xmath11-dimensional state process that is driven by a one - dimensional brownian motion , played until the state exits the domain .",
    "the functions @xmath7 and @xmath12 serve as terminal , and , respectively , running payoffs .",
    "the players controls enter in a diffusion coefficient and in an unbounded drift coefficient of the state process .",
    "the dynamics are degenerate in that it is possible for the players to completely switch off the brownian motion .",
    "we show that the game has value , and characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution @xmath4 ( uniqueness of solutions is known from @xcite ) of the equation @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the infinity - laplacian defined as @xmath15 , provided @xmath16 , where for a @xmath0 function @xmath17 we denote by @xmath18 the gradient and by @xmath19 the hessian matrix .",
    "our work is motivated by a representation for @xmath4 of peres et al .",
    "@xcite ( established in fact in a far greater generality ) , as the limit , as @xmath20 , of the value function @xmath21 of a discrete time random turn game , referred to as _ tug - of - war _ , in which @xmath22 is a parameter .",
    "the contribution of the current work is the identification of a game for which the value function is precisely equal to @xmath4 .",
    "the infinity - laplacian was first considered by aronsson @xcite in the study of absolutely minimal ( am ) extensions of lipschitz functions .",
    "given a lipschitz function @xmath4 defined on the boundary @xmath23 of a domain @xmath6 , a lipschitz function @xmath24 extending @xmath4 to @xmath25 is called an am extension of @xmath4 if , for every open @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where for a real function @xmath17 defined on @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a lipschitz function @xmath24 on @xmath25 that is @xmath0 on @xmath6 is an am extension of @xmath30 if and only if @xmath24 is infinity - harmonic , namely satisfies @xmath31 in @xmath6 .",
    "this connection enables in some cases to prove uniqueness of am extensions via pde tools .",
    "however , due to the degeneracy of this elliptic equation , classical pde approach in general is not applicable .",
    "jensen @xcite showed that an appropriate framework is through the theory of viscosity solutions , by establishing existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the homogeneous version ( @xmath32 ) of ( [ 07 ] ) , and showing that if @xmath7 is lipschitz then the solution is an am extension of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the relation to am extensions , the infinity - laplacian arises in a variety of other situations @xcite .",
    "some examples include models for sand - pile evolution @xcite , motion by mean curvature and stochastic target problems @xcite .",
    "we do not treat the homogenous equation for reasons mentioned later in this section .",
    "the inhomogeneous equation may admit multiple solutions when @xmath12 assumes both signs @xcite .",
    "our assumption on @xmath12 implies that either @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "uniqueness for the case where these strict inequalities are replaced with weak inequalities is unknown @xcite .",

    "the selected player is allowed to move the token from its current position @xmath40 to a new position @xmath41 in @xmath25 , in such a way that @xmath42 ( @xcite requires @xmath43 but this is an equivalent formulation in the setting described here ) .",

    "the associated payoff is given by @xmath46.\\ ] ] player i attempts to maximize the payoff and player ii s goal is to minimize it .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the value of the game , defined in a standard way and denoted @xmath47 , exists , that @xmath48 converges uniformly to a function @xmath49 referred to as the `` continuum value function '' and that @xmath49 is the unique viscosity solution of ( [ 07 ] ) ( these results are in fact also proved for the homogeneous case , and in generality greater than the scope of the current paper ) . the question of associating a game directly with the continuum value was posed and some basic technical challenges associated with it were discussed in @xcite .",
    "our approach to the question above is via a sdg formulation . to motivate the form of the sdg",

    "interpretation of the asymptotics of the third term is more subtle , and is a key element of the formulation .",
    "one possible approach is to replace the factor @xmath80 by a large quantity that is dynamically controlled by the two players .",

    "isaacs ( bi ) equations [ ( [ 07 ] ) can be viewed as such an equation due to ( [ 44 ] ) ] by the associated value function , is by proving that the value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle ( dpp ) .",
    "roughly speaking , this is an equation expressing the fact that , rather than attempting to maximize their profit by considering directly the payoff functional , the players may consider the payoff incurred up to a time @xmath155 plus the value function evaluated at the position @xmath117 that the state reaches at that time .",
    "although in a single player setting ( i.e. , in pure control problems ) dpp are well understood , game theoretic settings as in this paper are significantly harder .",
    "in particular , as we shall shortly point out , there are some basic open problems related to such dpp . in a setting with a finite time horizon , fleming and souganidis @xcite established a dpp based on careful discretization and approximation arguments .",
    "we have been unable to carry out a similar proof in the current setting , which includes a payoff given in terms of an exit time , degenerate diffusion and unbounded controls .",
    "swiech @xcite has developed an alternative approach to the above problem that relies on existence of solutions .",
    "instead of establishing a dpp for the value function , the idea of @xcite is to show that any _ solution _ must satisfy a dpp . to see what is meant by such a dpp and how it is used , consider the equation , @xmath202 in @xmath6 , @xmath200 on @xmath23 , where @xmath203 is a constant , associated with the payoff in ( [ 02 ] ) modified by a discount factor .",

    "sending @xmath209 in the above equations , one would formally obtain @xmath210 \\le v(x),\\ ] ] in particular yielding that if @xmath211 is a solution to the equation then it must equal the upper value function .",
    "this would establish unique solvability of the equation by the upper value function , provided there exists a solution . in the case",
    "@xmath212 , justifying the above formal limit is straightforward ( see @xcite ) but the case @xmath213 , as in our setting , requires a more careful argument .",
    "our proofs exploit the uniform positivity of @xmath12 due to which the minimizing player will not allow @xmath135 to be too large .",
    "this leads to uniform estimates on the decay of @xmath214 as @xmath215 , from which an inequality as in ( [ ins1155 ] ) follows readily .",
    "this discussion also explains why we are unable to treat the case @xmath32 .    establishing dpp as in ( [ 45 ] ) , ( [ 46 ] )",
    "is thus a key ingredient in this approach . for a class of bi equations , defined on all of @xmath84 , for which the associated game has a bounded action set and a fixed , finite time horizon , such a dpp was proved in swiech @xcite . in the current paper , although we do not establish ( [ 45 ] ) , ( [ 46 ] ) in the above form",
    ", we derive similar inequalities ( for @xmath213 ) for a related bounded action game , defined on @xmath6 .",
    "the characterization of the value function for the original unbounded action game is then treated by taking suitable limits .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite require some assumptions on the sample space and underlying filtration . in @xcite ,",
    "the underlying filtration is the one generated by the driving brownian motion .",
    "the approach taken in @xcite , which the current paper follows , allows for a general filtration as long as it is rich enough to support an @xmath11-dimensional brownian motion , independent of the brownian motion driving the state process [ for example , it could be the filtration generated by an @xmath110-dimensional brownian motion ] .",
    "the reason for imposing this requirement in @xcite is that inequalities similar to ( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 46 ] ) are proved by first establishing them for a game associated with a nondegenerate elliptic equation , and then taking a vanishing viscosity limit .",
    "this technical issue is the reason for including the auxiliary process @xmath114 in our formulation as well .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the question of validity of the dpp and the characterization of the value as the unique solution to the pde , under an arbitrary filtration , remains a basic open problem on sdgs .",
    "the unboundedness of the action space , on one hand , and the combination of degeneracy of the dynamics and an exit time criterion on the other hand , make it hard to adapt the results of @xcite to our setting . in order to overcome the first difficulty , we approximate the original sdg by a sequence of games with bounded action spaces , that are more readily analyzed . for the bounded action game , existence of solutions to the upper and lower bi equations follow from @xcite .",
    "we show that the solutions to these equations satisfy a dpp similar to ( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 46 ] ) ( proposition [ prop1 ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , existence of solutions along with the dpp yields the characterization of these solutions as the corresponding value functions .",
    "next , as we show in lemma [ lem5 ] , the upper and lower value functions for the bounded action games approach the corresponding value functions of the original game , pointwise , as the bounds approach  @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , in lemma [ lem4 ] , we show that any uniform subsequential limit , as the bounds approach @xmath132 , of solutions to the bi equation for bounded action games is a viscosity solution of ( [ 07 ] ) .",
    "the last piece in the proof of the main result is then showing existence of uniform ( subsequential ) limits .",
    "this is established in theorem [ th3 ] by proving equicontinuity , in the parameters governing the bounds , of the value functions for bounded action games .",
    "the proof of equicontinuity is the most technical part of this paper and the main place where the @xmath0 assumption on the domain is used .",
    "this is also the place where the possibility of degenerate dynamics close to the exit time needs to be carefully analyzed .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec3 ] , we prove theorem  [ th1 ] based on results on bi equations for bounded action sdg .",
    "these results are established in sections [ sec4 ] ( equicontinuity of the value functions ) and [ sec5 ] ( relating the value function to the pde ) . finally , it is natural to ask whether the state process , obtained under @xmath216-optimal play by both players , converges in law as @xmath216 tends to zero .",
