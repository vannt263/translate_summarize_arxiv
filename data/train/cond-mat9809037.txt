    "the properties of magnetic systems where the localized moments form a ladder like structure @xcite , have been intensively studied recently .",
    "most of such materials can be described by an isotropic spin hamiltonian , therefore the theoretical studies were almost exclusively done on isotropic models @xcite .",
    "the question arises as to what effect the anisotropy might have .",
    "the answer to the question is not trivial .",
    "it is known that two - leg ladder models with @xmath0 spins on both legs behave basically like an @xmath1 spin model if the rung coupling between the spins on the two legs is strong enough .",
    "it is also known that integer and half - odd integer spin models have essentially different phase diagrams , when considered as a function of the anisotropy of the exchange . beside the ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and planar",
    "phases a new one , the haldane phase @xcite appears for a finite range of anisotropy . our aim in this paper is to study , how this new phase appears in anisotropic ladder models for intermediate values of the interchain couplings .    for this purpose",
    "we have determined the low lying part of the energy spectrum of an anisotropic heisenberg ladder model by using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method proposed recently by white @xcite .",
    "we have generalized the method in such a way that together with any spin configuration that is kept after the truncation of the hilbert space , the other configurations related to it by the symmetries of the ladder model are also automatically taken into account .",
    "this allows to consider more states without increasing the size of the matrices and thereby to improve the accuracy .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a short description of the ladder model and show what phase diagrams are expected , if the value of the spins on the legs is @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the symmetry considerations introduced in the application of the dmrg procedure are briefly discussed in sec iii .",
    "iv presents the numerical results .",
    "finally sec v. contains a brief discussion of the results .",
    "in a two - leg ladder model the spins at rung @xmath2 will be denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the length of the spin can be arbitrary . in most of the calculations we will take @xmath0 spins , but",
    "a comparison with the @xmath1 case will also be considered .",
    "when the coupling between the legs is neglected , the hamiltonian of two decoupled anisotropic heisenberg chains is recovered .",
    "it can be written in the form , @xmath5\\nonumber\\\\      & & + \\sum_i\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } j_{xy } ( \\tau_i^+\\tau_{i+1}^- + \\tau_i^-\\tau_{i+1}^+ ) + j_{z}\\tau_i^z\\tau_{i+1}^z\\right]\\/. \\label{eq : h0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath6 part of the exchange is written in terms of the raising and lowering operators , and its coupling is allowed to differ from that of the @xmath7 part .",
    "introducing now the couplings between the chains , different kinds of ladder models can be constructed depending of the choice of this coupling .",
    "usually this coupling is assumed to act between spins on the same rung only . in an anisotropic model",
    "this would mean a coupling of the form , @xmath8   \\/.\\ ] ] in the limit when this coupling is ferromagnetic and strong , the two spins on the same rung couple into a single larger spin .",
    "that is the reason why a spin-1/2 ladder can behave like a spin-1 chain , or a spin-1 ladder like a spin-2 chain .    assuming that the diagonally situated nearest neighbour spins are also coupled , it was shown@xcite that this coupling makes the hidden topological long - range order characteristic for the haldane phase even stronger .",
    "an alternative way to introduce interchain coupling is to choose the following form for the interaction , @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\    & & +   \\sum_i\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } j'_{xy}(\\tau_i^+\\sigma_{i+1}^- +    \\tau_i^-\\sigma_{i+1}^+ ) + j'_{z}\\tau_i^z\\sigma_{i+1}^z\\right]\\/. \\label{eq : h1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper we look at the properties of the model defined by eqs.([eq : h0 ] ) and ( [ eq : h1 ] ) . in a special case",
    "this is equivalent to one of the models studied by white@xcite , but we will consider a larger parameter space , although the anisotropy ratio will be taken to be the same for the intrachain and interchain couplings , @xmath10 and therefore a single parameter @xmath11 will be used to characterize the strength of the interchain couplings .",
    "an interesting feature of our model is that by interchanging the spins between the two legs on every even or odd site , the intrachain and interchain couplings change their role . at @xmath12 , where the intrachain and interchain couplings are equal",
    ", the model is transformed into itself .",
    "for other values of @xmath13 , the energy scale has to be changed .",
    "taking this into account , we find that for @xmath14 all energy levels satisfy a simple self - duality relationship@xcite , @xmath15 this allows to connect the weak- and strong - coupling limits of the model . for @xmath16 the model would include ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings , which requires the modification@xcite of eq .",
    "( [ eq : self ] ) .",

    "it is obvious , that if both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are spin-1/2 operators , this model is not a true @xmath1 heisenberg model , since the two spins can form not only the triplet , but also the singlet combination .",
    "it has been shown@xcite , however , that the low lying levels of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heis ] ) and that of the true @xmath1 heisenberg model are identical , and therefore they have the same phase diagram .    the phase diagram expected for the model in the plane spanned by the anisotropy , @xmath22 and @xmath13 , is shown schematically in fig .   [",
    "fig : phase ] . in drawing the phase boundaries we have taken into account that the ferromagnetic phase appears for @xmath23 , independently of @xmath13 . on the other hand the boundary between the haldane and antiferromagnetic phases",
    "is expected to depend on @xmath13 . at @xmath24",
    "the ladder model consists of two decoupled spin-1/2 chains , and therefore the haldane phase does not exist . at @xmath25 , according to previous finite - size calculations@xcite on the equivalent @xmath1 chain , the massive haldane phase exists in a finite range of anisotropy .",
    "the numbers obtained for the critical values of the anisotropy are somewhat different in the different calculations , but the best estimates give the range @xmath26 the value of the critical anisotropy , @xmath27 , where the transition from the haldane phase with singlet ground state to the doubly degenerate antiferromagnetic state occurs , is not determined by any symmetry .",
    "it is an ising type transition .",
    "close to it , on both sides of the transition point the gap opens linearly .",
    "it follows from the duality relationship for the energy levels that if @xmath28 is a critical point , then @xmath29 should also be a critical coupling .",
    "the phase boundary of the antiferromagnetic phase should therefore start from @xmath30 at @xmath31 , returning to this value when @xmath32 , and passing through @xmath27 at @xmath33 .",
    "looking at the boundary between the haldane and planar phases , the massive phase appears from the critical planar phase via a kosterlitz - thouless type transition . in the continuum limit of the @xmath1 chain the value @xmath34",
    "is obtained @xcite for the critical anisotropy .",
    "this particular value suggests that it is determined by a hidden symmetry of the model , and therefore it is expected that this same critical value could be found in the @xmath0 spin ladder model at any @xmath13 .",
    "this would mean that for @xmath35 the interchain coupling is a relevant perturbation .",
    "an arbitrarily small coupling will already generate a haldane gap .",
    "the corresponding phase boundary is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] by a vertical straight line at @xmath36 .",
    "this natural assumption becomes questionable , however , if we compare this phase diagram with that of the spin-1 ladder .",
    "based on similar considerations we can argue that at @xmath31 the behavior is that of two decoupled spin-1 chains , while at @xmath17 the properties of the spin-2 heisenberg model should be recovered .",
    "since both are integer spin models , the haldane phase exists in both cases in an extended range of anisotropy around the isotropic antiferromagnetic point . in the spin-2 model",
    "this range is , however , much narrower@xcite than in the spin-1 case , so clearly the boundaries of the haldane phase to both the planar and the antiferromagnetic phases should strongly depend on the interchain coupling , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase-2 ] .",
    "moreover the value of the haldane gap is much smaller in the @xmath37 spin chain than for @xmath1 .",
    "this is known reliably for the isotropic antiferromagnetic model only@xcite , but should be true in the anisotropic case as well .",
    "we show schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps ] , how the antiferromagnetic and haldane gaps depend on the anisotropy for the spin-1/2 , spin-1 and spin-2 heisenberg models . in all cases the antiferromagnetic state",
    "has a doubly degenerate ground state with a finite energy gap to the spin wave excitations . for @xmath0",
    "the transition into this state is of kosterlitz - thouless type , and the gap opens exponentially slowly . for spin-1 and spin-2 chains the transition from the haldane phase is of second order ,",
    "so the gap opens linearly on both sides .",
    "the vanishing of the haldane gap at @xmath38 happens again in a kosterlitz - thouless - like manner .    by coupling now two spin-1 chains into a spin-1 ladder",
    ", the effect of the interchain coupling is expected to be opposite to that discussed above .",
    "the haldane gap decreases or it might even vanish when this coupling is switched on .",
    "this raises the question whether in the spin-1/2 ladder model the interchain coupling is in fact a relevant perturbation for @xmath39 , and perhaps the phase boundary between the haldane and planar phases does not go in the way discussed above .",
    "an alternative possibility is shown in fig .  [ fig : phase ] by a dashed line .",
    "in this paper we try to elucidate this problem by looking at the degeneracy of the ground state and the generation or disappearance of gaps when the interchain couplings are switched on . in order to do this",
    "we have applied the dmrg method @xcite to the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) and ( [ eq : h1 ] ) using the anisotropy @xmath40 and the relative strength of the interchain coupling , @xmath13 as the two parameters .",
    "it has been found earlier in various applications , that the dmrg method gives better results for systems with open boundary condition ( obc ) than for periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when obc is used , the free spins remaining at the ends in the valence - bond like state of the ladder model introduce extra energy - level degeneracies , and therefore the analysis of the spectrum becomes somewhat more difficult . in that region of the couplings , where the gap is very small , in order to get more accurate results ,",
    "we have used obc , otherwise we have done calculations with both boundary conditions .",
    "the major limiting factor in the application of the dmrg method is that only a subset of all possible states is kept , and the eigenvalue matrix is diagonalized in this subspace only .",
    "the accuracy can be improved , if first the hilbert space is block diagonalized by taking into account the natural symmetries of the hamiltonian , and the dmrg procedure is applied to the blocks separately , considering the same fixed number of states in each block .",
    "when using obc , translational symmetry is lost , so the total momentum is not a good quantum number . in the anisotropic model we also loose the @xmath41 symmetry .",
    "therefore only the @xmath42 component of the total spin , @xmath43 can be used to classify the energy levels .",
    "it is easily seen that the ladder model hamiltonian has two further symmetries , two mirror planes that are perpendicular to the plane of the ladder .",
    "one goes across the middle of the rungs of the ladder .",
    "it transforms the @xmath20 and @xmath21 spins into each other ( @xmath20@xmath21 symmetry ) .",
    "the other cuts the legs of the ladder in the middle , reflecting the spins on the left onto spins on the right ( left  right symmetry ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath44 subspace , which will be of particular interest for us , has an additional symmetry , the spin reversal or up  down symmetry .",
    "the corresponding operators will be denoted as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the eigenstates of the system can be either symmetric or antisymmetric under these operations .",
    "an even parity state will be labelled by @xmath48 while an odd parity state by @xmath49 .",
    "it is advantageous to include these symmetries in the dmrg procedure by choosing wave functions that are eigenstates of the parity operators . using the notation of white @xcite ,",
    "the superblock wave function @xmath50 is formed out of the states @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the two blocks and the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the two new added spins , @xmath55 @xmath56 is a normalization constant which takes the value @xmath57 or @xmath58 , depending on whether the state obtained by the symmetry operation is identical with the original one or not .",
    "the @xmath20@xmath21 and spin reversal operations are products of local operators that act on the spin states of a single rung , so they can be used even if the left and right blocks are not of equal length .",
    "the four states @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 spins on the same rung span a basis on which @xmath63    in each iteration cycle of building larger blocks the operators are renormalized as @xmath64 and they are stored with the other block operators .",
    "the @xmath65 matrix contains the new truncated basis states of the subsequent iteration cycles .",
    "a local operator acting on a block state gives @xmath66 where the coefficient @xmath67 is @xmath68 or @xmath69 for the symmetric or antisymmetric combination , respectively .",
    "in the first step of the infinite algorithm , when the block consists of the states of a single rung , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the iterated matrix @xmath72 has one element in each row and that value gives @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the local symmetries simply give @xmath74    on the other hand the operator @xmath75 mixes the states of different rungs and can be used only when the two blocks are of equal length .",
    "when acting on a superblock wave function , it gives @xmath76    the total parity of the wave function is the product of the left ",
    "right , @xmath77 and @xmath20@xmath21 parities . in",
    "what follows , unless otherwise specified , only the total parity will be given .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if several symmetries are used , the factor @xmath56 has to be included for each symmetry .",
    "this ensures that every configuration is taken into account only once .",
    "all these symmetry operations reduce the size of the hilbert space of the superblock hamiltonian by a factor of about two .",
    "this decreases the memory requirements and allows to keep more spin configurations , which improves the accuracy of the dmrg method .",
    "the local symmetries can be included into both the infinite- and finite - system algorithms .",
    "the left - right symmetry can be used in the infinite - system method only , but by keeping more states it would produce better starting vectors @xcite for the diagonalizaton procedure in the finite - system method .    using these symmetry considerations the hilbert space",
    "is split into subspaces characterized by the @xmath42 component of the total spin and the parity . in order to obtain the ground state and",
    "some low lying states of the ladder , in principle one has to determine a few low lying eigenstates of all subspaces . for a finite chain with @xmath78 sites the @xmath79 energy level of the @xmath80 sector with parity @xmath81",
    "will be denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "similarly the energy gap between the states with energies @xmath83 and @xmath84 will be denoted by @xmath85 .    except for the ferromagnetic regime , in the spin-1/2 chain",
    "the lowest lying energy level belongs to the @xmath86 sector and it has odd parity under left - right and spin reflection symmetries for @xmath87 while it has even parity for chains with @xmath88 .",
    "the parity of the first excited state is opposite to that of the ground state and the parity changes for every higher lying level .",
    "therefore , in the infinite - lattice algorithm of the dmrg method the parity has to be changed in every iteration cycle .",
    "this difficulty does not arise either in the spin-1 chain or in the ladder models . in the spin-1 chain",
    "the ground state was found to be in the @xmath86 sector with even parity under left - right reflection for all chain lengths @xmath78 . in the ladder model beside the left to right reflection we also have the @xmath20@xmath21 symmetry .",
    "the ground state of this model has positive parity under both reflections for all non - negative values of @xmath13 .",
    "the excited states also preserves their parity as a function of @xmath13 . therefore in this case",
    "the same symmetry combination has to be used in every successive step of the dmrg algorithm .",
    "because the energy gaps are expected to be rather small close to the phase boundaries , we have used the finite - lattice method version of dmrg with two or three iteration cycles .",
    "we calculated the energy gaps for ladders with @xmath89 sites , and used a finite - size scaling procedure to extrapolate to infinite system . due to our restricted computational facility the number of states @xmath90",
    "representing the block in the dmrg method could be chosen between @xmath91 and @xmath92 states .",
    "the truncation error was worst close to the critical points .",
    "for the second and higher excited states it was about @xmath93 , corresponding to a real error of about @xmath94 .",
    "several formulae have been proposed to extrapolate the finite - size results to the thermodynamic limit . when a finite gap is expected , the @xmath95 limit of the gap can be obtained by fitting the energy difference of the various @xmath84 energy levels to the form @xcite @xmath96 . on the other hand , for open systems , where the finite size effects",
    "are more pronounced , the form@xcite @xmath97 or an inverse squared dependence@xcite @xmath98 should be used .",
    "the former one is known to give a lower - bound estimate of the gap .    in most cases",
    "we have used the formulae with @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "the exponential dependence was assumed when neither the @xmath101 nor the @xmath102 fit gave satisfactory result .",
    "in this section we present the results of our numerical calculations .",
    "since the gaps are expected to be rather small , resulting in relatively large errors in the extrapolation to infinite systems , we are not able to locate exactly the phase boundaries , where the gaps vanish . we will therefore restrict ourselves to a qualitative check of how the phase diagram may look like .    because nothing particularly interesting is expected on the @xmath103 side , the system is ferromagnetic if @xmath104 and planar if @xmath105 independently of @xmath13 , in what follows we will consider the @xmath106 region only .",
    "we have chosen four different values of the anisotropy , namely @xmath107 and varied @xmath13 from 0 to 1 , to see how the character of the ground state changes .",
    "the energies will always be measured in units of @xmath108 .      as mentioned above , at @xmath31 the properties of two decoupled spin-1/2 chains",
    "should be recovered , while at @xmath25 at least the low energy part of the spectrum is identical to that of the spin-1 chain .",
    "our calculations along these lines aimed to test the accuracy of the method and to find the relevant subspaces of the hilbert space .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath109 , the antiferromagnetic chains give a @xmath110-fold degenerate ground state in the @xmath111 subspace .",
    "accordingly the gap @xmath112 and two other gaps in the @xmath113 sector should go to zero in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "in fact our calculation gives an extrapolated value of the order of @xmath94 .",
    "this shows the real accuracy of the numerical calculations .",
    "the next levels above this fourfold degenerate ground state have one or two spins flipped .",
    "the corresponding gaps , @xmath115 and @xmath116 were found to be finite , opening slowly as the anisotropy increases . above this gap a continuum of states is found as shown by the vanishing of the gap @xmath117 .    in the planar phase",
    "all these gaps should vanish .",
    "in fact in the range @xmath118 the gaps @xmath115 and @xmath116 were found to be of the order of @xmath94 , which we consider to be zero .    along the line",
    "@xmath17 the antiferromagnetic phase appears for @xmath119 .",
    "the twofold degeneracy of the ground state is in fact recovered , since the gap @xmath112 scales to values of the order of @xmath94 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic gap @xmath115 remains finite .    in the haldane phase , @xmath120 , we have again a fourfold degenerate ground state , if the ladder has free ends , but here the gaps @xmath112 and @xmath115 should scale to zero exponentially .",
    "the values obtained for the gap are of the order of @xmath121 .",
    "the next levels above them are @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which cross each other at @xmath124 .",
    "therefore the real gap above the ground state is @xmath116 for @xmath125 , while it is @xmath126 for @xmath109 .",
    "this gap was found to be 0.147(1 ) , 0.4105(3 ) , 0.223(1 ) , 0.096(3 ) for @xmath127 .",
    "our result at @xmath128 agrees quite well with the best estimate @xcite for the haldane gap of the isotropic @xmath1 model .",
    "taking now intermediate values for @xmath13 , we consider first the transition from the haldane phase to the antiferromagnetic phase for @xmath109 .",
    "since the phase boundary is not determined by any symmetry , it is expected that for @xmath129 the antiferromagnetic gap , @xmath115 which is finite at @xmath130 , should vanish for a finite @xmath131 , and then for larger @xmath13 the haldane gap @xmath126 should open up .",

    "this gap is finite . at the same time",
    "the antiferromagnetic gap is found to vanish . for @xmath134 , however , no reliable extrapolation procedure was found and therefore we can only claim that the transition from the antiferromagnetic to the haldane phase occurs at a very small value of @xmath13 , between @xmath31 and @xmath135 .",
    "this indicates , that due to the smallness of the antiferromagnetic gap of the spin-1/2 chain , a very small although finite interchain coupling is sufficient to drive the system into the haldane phase .",
    "this means that the phase boundary starts from the @xmath128 , @xmath31 point with an almost horizontal slope .",
    "taking a somewhat larger anisotropy , @xmath136 , the antiferromagnetic state survives to a larger value of @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",

    "our results are not in contradiction with the assumption that @xmath28 is finite , although small , except when @xmath22 is rather close to @xmath166 , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .    we should also mention that since the point @xmath167 on the boundary between the haldane and planar phases was obtained in the continuum limit , it can not be excluded that in the lattice model this boundary at @xmath17 is not exactly at @xmath36 , but at a small negative value . in this case the boundary between the haldane and planar phases should be slightly deformed from that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .    on the basis of our calculations , unfortunately , we are unable to decide , which scenario takes place .",
    "the argument that gave @xmath168 at @xmath17 would give a phase boundary which is independent of @xmath13 , meaning that the interchain coupling is relevant for any @xmath22 in the range @xmath169 . the same reasoning",
    "might then indicate that the interchain coupling is relevant also in the case when four @xmath0 chains are coupled . with an appropriate choice of the couplings",
    "this would , however , generate a four - leg ladder that behaves like an @xmath37 chain . in this model",
    "the phase boundary between the planar and haldane phases can not be independent of @xmath13 , in the same way as in the two - leg @xmath1 ladder .",
    "further calculations , keeping probably close to 1000 states in the dmrg procedure , are necessary to decide between these possible scenarios and to determine the precise shape of the phase boundaries .",
