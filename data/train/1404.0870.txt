    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze , @xcite ) is inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off electrons in clusters of galaxies or any cosmic structures .",
    "it is amongst major sources of secondary anisotropies of the cmb on sub - degree angular scales .",
    "the most noticeable feature of the sze is that its brightness is apparently independent of the source redshift @xmath0 because its intrinsic intensity increases with redshifts together with the energy density of seed ( cmb ) photons ; otherwise observed brightness should decrease rapidly as @xmath1 .",
    "this makes the sze a unique probe of the distant universe .",
    "the sze also has a characteristic spectral shape which helps separating it from other signals such as radio galaxies and primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "recent developments of large area surveys by the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite , and the planck satellite @xcite have enlarged the sample of galaxy clusters observed through the sze by more than an order of magnitude over the last decade as illustrated in figure [ fig - nsz ] . to date , the sze by thermal electrons ( thermal sze ) has been detected for about @xmath2 galaxy clusters including more than 200 new clusters previously unknown by any other observational means .",
    "the imprint of yet unresolved smaller - scale cosmic structures has been explored by means of their angular power spectrum @xcite and the stacking analysis @xcite .",
    "there have been reports of detections of the sze by peculiar motions of galaxy clusters ( kinematic sze ) either statistically @xcite or from a high - velocity merger @xcite .",
    "dashed line shows 813 clusters detected by the planck satellite over all sky @xcite . for reference ,",
    "hatched region marks 34 clusters with @xmath4 sze detections published as of 2002 ( @xcite and references therein ) which consist mainly of x - ray luminous clusters.,width=321 ]    the sensitivity of the sze observations of individual clusters has also improved significantly , making it a useful tool for studying physics of intracluster plasma .",
    "in particular , the sze data provide a direct measure of thermal pressure of electrons , which is highly complementary to x - ray observations .",
    "they allow us to study the distance - redshift relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , three - dimensional structures @xcite , and dynamics @xcite of galaxy clusters . by means of the sze",
    ", we are witnessing the high - mass end of structure formation in the universe that in turn serves as a powerful probe of cosmology .",
    "theoretical foundations and earlier observations of the sze are reviewed extensively by @xcite . in the present paper , we focus mainly on practical applications of the sze that have become more feasible by recent observations , and discuss their cosmological and astrophysical implications . unless explicitly stated otherwise and wherever necessary to assume specific values of cosmological parameters , we adopt a conventional @xmath5cdm model with the matter density parameter @xmath6 , the dark energy density parameter @xmath7 , the baryon density parameter @xmath8 , the hubble constant @xmath9 , the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath10 , the amplitude of density fluctuations @xmath11 , and the spectral index of primordial density fluctuations @xmath12 .",
    "when cmb photons pass through a cloud of free electrons with number density @xmath13 , they are subject to scattering with a probability characterized by the optical depth @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the thomson cross section , @xmath16 denotes the line - of - sight integral , and the quoted values are typical of galaxy clusters .",
    "it follows that a single scattering is in general a good approximation even in largest galaxy clusters .",
    "the thomson limit applies in the rest frame of an electron as long as its velocity @xmath17 relative to the cmb satisfies @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the electron mass , @xmath20 is the speed of light , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath22 is the cmb temperature . in the cmb rest frame , on the other hand ,",

    "compton scattering takes place in a wide range of cosmic plasma , the term sze is conventionally used for scattering of the cmb photons at ghz to thz frequencies by non - relativistic or mildly relativistic electrons .",

    "the ratio between the kinematic sze and the thermal sze is proportional to @xmath40 in the non - relativistic limit.,width=321 ]    isotropic random motions of maxwellian electrons , on the other hand , give rise to the thermal sze @xcite . for electrons with temperature @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ,",

    "although the thermal sze is of second order in @xmath27 , it dominates over the kinematic sze typically by an order of magnitude for galaxy clusters because the thermal velocity of electrons @xmath49 kms@xmath24 is much larger than bulk velocities of @xmath50 kms@xmath24 . in the non - relativistic limit , spectral shapes of the kinematic sze and the thermal sze ( eqs [ [ eq - ksz ] ] and [ [ eq - tsz ] ] ) depend only on @xmath35 .",
    "corrections due to higher order terms are non - negligible once electrons become relativistic @xcite .",

    "the thermal sze leads to a decrement at @xmath55 ghz ( @xmath56 ) and an increment at higher frequencies .",
    "the relativistic correction shifts the null of the thermal sze and modifies the spectral shape especially at high frequencies .",
    "the kinematic sze , on the other hand , has its peak near the null of the thermal sze .",
    "multi - frequency measurements are necessary to separate the kinematic sze from the thermal sze and/or to determine @xmath41 via the relativistic correction .",
    "figure [ fig - szimage ] further shows real images of a galaxy cluster , abell 2256 , taken by planck @xcite .",

    "the second effect , together with the kinematic sze , will in principle offer a measure of the 3d velocity of the gas .",
    "the third effect will allow us to separate @xmath51 and @xmath69 in the thermal sze .",
    "nonthermal electrons also upscatter the cmb photons . a number of galaxy clusters host diffuse synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons with @xmath70 ( see @xcite for a review ) ; while inverse compton scattering by the same population of electrons should emerge in hard x - rays , their lower energy counterparts , if present , give rise to the nonthermal sze . predicted spectral distortions of the cmb , particularly at high frequencies , are sensitive to the underlying energy distribution of nonthermal electrons @xcite .",
    "major difficulties in actually observing them are the short life - time of suprathermal electrons as well as a large amount of contamination including the thermal sze itself and dusty galaxies .",
    "a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmology is that the cmb temperature evolves with redshift adiabatically as @xmath71 where @xmath72 k is the present - day cmb temperature measured by cobe - firas @xcite .",
    "any deviation from the above evolution would be a signature of a violation of conventional assumptions such as the local position invariance and the photon number conservation .",
    "in fact , redshift - independence of the spectral shape of the sze mentioned in section [ sec - sz ] also relies on equation ( [ eq - tcmbz ] ) .",
    "this in turn makes it possible to use the observed sze spectra to measure the cmb temperature @xcite at an arbitrary @xmath0 and test the validity of equation ( [ eq - tcmbz ] ) .",
    "a great advantage of this method is that it uses only the spectral shape of the thermal sze and does not rely , at least in principle , on details of underlying gas properties . in practice ,",
    "appropriate gas distributions should be taken into account to correct for beam dilution effects at different observing frequencies . as long as the large - scale bulk motion is small ( see section [ sec - unres ] )",
    ", the kinematic sze would primarily increase the dispersion of the measurement .",
    "the relativistic effects on the sze can be suppressed by using clusters with relatively low electron temperatures ; accurate temperature measurements of individual clusters will be necessary otherwise .",
    "multi - frequency data will also be crucial for separating contamination by radio sources , cmb primary anisotropies , and dust emission .",
    "a conventional approach of generalizing equation ( [ eq - tcmbz ] ) is to adopt the form @xmath73 @xcite and to determine the parameter @xmath74 from the data .",

    "major sources of systematics are contributions of other heating sources , such as collisions and local radiation fields . combining transition lines of various species are particularly useful for constraining the physical conditions of the absorbing gas ; e.g. , a comprehensive analysis of a molecular absorber at @xmath82 yields @xmath83 k @xcite in agreement with the adiabatic expectation of 5.15 k ( fig .",

    "it should be noted that completeness of the samples degrades toward low mass and the estimated masses may be biased particularly at higher @xmath0 since they are based on empirical relations extrapolated from low @xmath0 . within such uncertainties , the detected numbers are consistent with the predictions and it is likely that one will start to find clusters at @xmath210 by reaching deeper fluxes corresponding to @xmath211 .",
    "the predicted numbers of clusters are the most sensitive to underlying values of @xmath114 and @xmath212 .",

    "the origin of this tension is still not entirely clear but may be ascribed to incomplete instrumental calibration , underestimating true masses of clusters , missing a fraction of massive clusters , suppression of density fluctuations at small scales by , e.g. , massive neutrinos , or any combination thereof .    since clusters of galaxies comprise the largest virialized structures in the universe , the evolution of their numbers up to high @xmath0 provides a sensitive probe of the growth of cosmic structures , which is highly complementary to purely geometrical methods such as type ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "it can be used to explore the nature of dark energy within a framework of standard cosmology ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as to search for any departure from the standard framework itself .",
    "for instance , the linear growth rate of density fluctuations @xmath214 can be generalized as @xcite @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the cosmic scale factor , @xmath217 , and the index @xmath218 takes nearly a constant value @xmath219 if general relativity holds .",

    "this is a challenging issue particularly at @xmath220 , where spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy or weak lensing becomes increasingly difficult ; even if empirical scaling relations are to be used , they must be calibrated by some independent means . to this end",

    "the accuracy of cosmological studies using the sze is largely limited by our understanding of astrophysics of galaxy clusters .",

    "this is in fact an alternative to the distance determination described in section [ sec - xsz ] ; a cluster elongated by some fraction over the line - of - sight will enhance the value of @xmath234 in equation ( [ eq - xsz1 ] ) by the same fraction .",
    "observed x - ray images of galaxy clusters have projected axis ratios with a mean @xmath235 and a dispersion @xmath236 @xcite , and the sze data will further add line - of - sight information .",
    "for example , x - ray and multi - frequency sze data of abell 1689 can be explained well by a mildly triaxial cluster with a minor to major axis ratio of @xmath237 , preferentially elongated along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "one can further explore the 3d orientation of the dark matter halo by combining weak lensing data and assuming , for instance , that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite or it shares the same axis directions with the dark matter @xcite .",
    "note that the sze brightness of an individual cluster at a single frequency can be biased by the kinematic sze ; figure [ fig - rxjeta ] illustrates that a combination of multi - frequency data , particularly of both decrement ( @xmath238 ghz ) and increment ( @xmath239 ghz ) of the sze , is useful for breaking the degeneracy between the line - of - sight elongation and the peculiar velocity .     and",

    "clusters of galaxies often display signatures of violent mergers , which comprise the most energetic phenomena in the universe with the total kinematic energy @xmath240 ergs and mark directly the sites of cosmic structure formation .",
    "associations with synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons indicate that a certain degree of particle acceleration is also induced during cluster mergers , although the precise mechanism is still unknown .",
    "while x - ray and low - frequency ( @xmath241ghz ) radio observations have been widely used to find such merger shocks at low redshifts ( see @xcite for reviews ) , the sze provides a promising and complementary diagnostics up to high redshifts .",
    "since the thermal sze and the kinematic sze are proportional to thermal pressure and the bulk velocity , respectively , they serve as direct probes of shock fronts ( i.e. , pressure gaps ) and gas dynamics .",
    "in addition , sze images with a spatial resolution of @xmath242 @xcite or better will continue to play a unique role in resolving the shock - heated gas with @xmath243 kev , given that spatial resolutions of current and near future hard x - ray ( @xmath244 kev ) instruments are limited to @xmath245 . by measuring a gap across the shock of either density , temperature , or pressure , one can infer the mach number @xmath246 ( i.e. , gas velocity normalized by its sound speed in the rest frame of the shock front ) from rankine - hugoniot relations : @xmath247 where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote preshock and postshock quantities respectively , and an adiabatic index of @xmath248 has been used .",
    "the product of these equations readily yield the pressure ratio .",
    "a prototype of intensive sze studies on a merging cluster is given by those on rx j1347.5 - 1145 at @xmath249 , the brightest cluster known to date in the sze .",
    "this cluster was originally thought to be highly relaxed , based on smooth morphology of the soft x - ray ( @xmath250 kev ) image by rosat @xcite .",
    "the sze observation by noba with @xmath251 beam @xcite , however , revealed that it has a prominent substructure at @xmath252 southeast of the cluster center as shown in figure [ fig - rxj1347 ] .",
    "this finding has been confirmed subsequently with chandra 0.57 kev data @xcite as well as more recent high sensitivity sze images by mustang with @xmath253 beam @xcite and by carma with the smallest synthesized beam of @xmath254 @xcite .",
    "independent sze measurements of this cluster have also been published using scuba @xcite , diabolo @xcite , ovro / bima @xcite , suzie @xcite , bolocam and z - spec @xcite .",
    "the inferred temperature of the substructure is @xmath255 kev , which is about a factor of @xmath256 higher than the mean temperature of this cluster @xmath257 kev @xcite ; this is in accord with the fact that the substructure is more obvious in the sze than soft x - rays .",
    "it follows that the cluster is probably undergoing a major merger ; applying equation ( [ eq - rankine ] ) to the above mentioned temperatures gives the mach number of @xmath258 and the corresponding pre - shock velocity of @xmath259 kms@xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig - rxj1347 ] further illustrates that diffuse synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons is spatially associated with the hot substructure @xcite .",

    "the fraction of merging clusters is likely to increase with redshifts as the growth of density fluctuations becomes faster prior to the onset of cosmic acceleration .",

    "shocks in galaxy clusters are in general hard to find in x - rays because they often appear at outskirts and are also hidden by a sharp radial gradient of @xmath269 ; density peaks behind the contact discontinuity are much easier to be seen in x - rays as cold fronts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
