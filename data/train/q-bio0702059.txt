    "recent experimental developments in the fields of genomics , e.g. whole genome dna sequencing or proteomics , are opening possibilities for systems level studies in biology @xcite .",
    "in particular , the notion that biological functions may rely on a large number of interconnected variables ( for example genes ) working in concert has stimulated general theoretical interest about properties of biological networks @xcite .",
    "studies of the statistical properties of large ( typically thousands of nodes ) biological networks have identified a number of functional building block , termed network motifs , that occur more frequently than random @xcite .",
    "these findings support the idea that some systems are designed around a modular architecture , in which autonomous modules are wired together to generate versatile biological functions @xcite . while structural ( or topological ) properties are key for network characterization , functional properties are ultimately encoded in dynamical , or time - dependent changes in the state variables of the nodes .",
    "the sizes of systems that can be modeled dynamically are typically much smaller ( 10 - 100 nodes ) .",
    "one common modeling approach , for example for the yeast cell - cycle @xcite , is to simulate the nonlinear system of chemical rate equations describing the putative biochemical processes .",
    "modeling approaches have been applied to a number of systems , including the cell - cycle @xcite , the lambda - phage switch in e. coli @xcite .",
    "although these models provide a detailed description , this approach suffers from the caveat that most parameters are currently not accessible experimentally .",
    "in addition , the number of parameters is typically about five per reaction , resulting in a prohibitively large parameter space .",
    "this last point makes it difficult to grasp the full solution space of the model .",
    "recent approaches based on sampling the parameter space in optimal regions have been developed @xcite . at the opposite end of model complexity ,",
    "dynamical rules based on boolean state variables have been useful for studying more global dynamical properties of topological classes of networks @xcite .",
    "in addition , boolean models have been successfully applied to the yeast cell - cycle @xcite and the body patterning in drosophila embryos @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we develop a systematic approach to describe how the dynamical landscape of small ( less than about 50 nodes ) boolean networks is affected by perturbations in the network connectivity .",
    "in particular , we consider the basin entropy @xmath0 , a quantity that considers the size distribution of the basins of attraction .",
    "we complement entropy with a measure of distance between the stable fixed points of a perturbed network and those in the unperturbed network .",
    "this combination gives a low - dimensional and compact representation of the patterns induced by a large number of perturbations .",
    "we illustrate our methods using the yeast cell - cycle network introduced in @xcite , and discuss examples of structural perturbations producing a range of modified basins of attraction .",
    "following @xcite a network of @xmath2 nodes can be represented by a @xmath3 adjacency matrix @xmath4 , in which an activating link between node @xmath5 and node @xmath6 is represented by @xmath7 and an inhibiting link by @xmath8 . the possibility of self - inhibitory ( or activating links ) @xmath9 is not excluded . in the boolean approximation ,",
    "each node has two possible states , so that the global state of all nodes can be represented by a vector @xmath10 , with @xmath11 when the node @xmath5 is _ on _ and @xmath12 if the node is _",
    "off_. the full phase space containing @xmath13 states is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "a simple dynamical rule that characterizes the temporal evolution of the state variable can be defined following @xcite , which is closely related to update rules applied in perceptron models .",
    "if the network is in the state @xmath15 at time @xmath16 , the state at the next time - step @xmath17 is given by :    s_i(t+1)=\\ {    ccc 1 & & _ j a_ijs_j(t)>0 + s_i(t)&&_j a_ijs_j(t)=0 + 0 & & _ j a_ijs_j(t)<0 +    .    for a given network , we apply this rule to every possible initial condition in @xmath14 .",
    "this defines orbits ( trajectories ) that must end in a limit cycle ( periodic attractor ) since we are dealing with a dynamical system on a finite space .",
    "a fixed point is a cycle of length one .",
    "accordingly , @xmath14 can be decomposed into a disjoint union of @xmath18 basins of attraction @xmath19 of size @xmath20 : @xmath21 .    in a biological network",
    ", the attractors correspond to functional endpoints , and it is important that the states in the attractors are consistent with observed data .",
    "for example , by far the largest endpoint in the cell - cycle network of li et al .",
    "( see appendix ) corresponds to the stationary g1 phase in the cycle .",
    "other systems are more switch - like , for instance in signal transduction , where a cell might change its state from growth to differentiation according to an external trigger . to characterize these attractors , we introduce the following definitions :    * we compute the _ number of attractors _ @xmath18 : an attractor is a limit cycle or a fixed point .",
    "an attractor @xmath4 has a basin of attraction @xmath22 which is the set of all initial conditions whose orbit converges to @xmath4 . *",
    "the _ basin entropy _",
    "@xmath0 is defined as follows : let @xmath23 be the probability that an initial state belongs to basin @xmath19 . then , the entropy reads h:=-_k=1^k p_k(p_k ) @xmath0 is maximum ( @xmath24 ) if each state is its own basin of size one , and minimum ( @xmath25 ) when there is one single basin .",
    "@xmath0 is a natural measure for characterizing basin structures @xcite .",
    "because it takes into account the relative basin sizes , it is quite insensitive to appearance of small and biologically irrelevant basins . *",
    "the _ perturbation size _ @xmath1 measures the distance between attractors of a perturbed and a reference network : from every initial conditions , the hamming distance between the fixed points is computed , and the average over all initial conditions is taken .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath26 is the fixed point of the trajectory starting at @xmath10 and generated by the network g , then @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hamming distance between two boolean states , namely @xmath29 + the value @xmath1 has the following interpretation : it is the average probability ( taken over all nodes ) that , for a random initial condition , the final state of a node differs . in this study",
    ", the reference network @xmath30 will be the cell - cycle network of li et al .",
    ", which has one very a large basin of attraction and several smaller ones .",
    "if some trajectories in the perturbed networks @xmath31 end in a limit cycle , @xmath1 is defined as the average of the hamming distance along the cycle .      our goal is to assess how network dynamics is affected by several types of perturbations .",
    "we consider two classes : one which randomizes the adjacency matrix while keeping a number of topological characteristics from the original network invariant .",
    "the second class mimics biological perturbations , as would occur for example through mutations in the interaction partners that constitute the network links.the two classes are defined as follows :    * _ shuffle _ ( class i ) : all activating and inhibiting arrows are cut in half and re - wired randomly .",
    "this ensure that the connectivity at each node is conserved . as compared to the li et al .",
    "@xcite study , we generate random networks that are more constrained , since the connectivity at each node is forced to remain unchanged after randomization .",
    "such perturbations are applied in the studies of network motifs @xcite . * _ remove _ ( class ii ) : the arrows are simply suppressed .",
    "we extend this class of perturbations beyond single link removal .",
    "we study the yeast cell - cycle network of li et al .",
    "@xcite ( the _ yeast cell - cycle network _ or _ ycc _ ) , in which a boolean model reproducing the different phases of the cycle is constructed ( see appendix ) .",
    "this model has a main fixed point attracting @xmath32 of the intial conditions .",
    "biologically this state corresponds to the g1 stationary phase of the cell - cycle , as reflected by the activities of the respective nodes .",
    "using computer simulations , the authors further showed that the cell - cycle dynamics had certain robustness properties when challenged with perturbations .",
    "in particular , it was shown that in a majority of cases , removal of one link or addition of a link at random did not change much the size of the largest basin of attraction .",
    "finally , the studied network had unusual trajectory channeling properties , when compared to random networks with equal number of nodes and links . here",
    "we extend the characterization of this model by introducing a combination of measures to characterize the structure of basins of attraction as they are modified by structural perturbations .",
    "in particular we investigate the consequences of combined mutations and show that they can lead to cancellation effect .",
    "this type of perturbation allows to study the dynamical characteristics of a biological network in comparison with random networks belonging to a topological class .",
    "figure 1 shows the number of attractors ( @xmath18 ) and the entropy ( @xmath0 ) of the ycc and randomly shuffled ( class i ) versions thereof .",
    "the location of the reference network in the @xmath33 plane respective to the scatter of the perturbed networks allows us to asses how typical a network behaves with respect to a class .",
    "accordingly , the ycc is atypical , as seen by its marginal location in the lower left corner .",
    "indeed , this network has lower entropy and fewer basins than most networks , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion shows how entropy characterizes the system of attractors .",
    "however , @xmath0 contains only information about the relative weights of the attractors , irrespective of their biological relevance .",
    "for example a perturbation can decrease the entropy while shifting the fixed point away from from that in the unperturbed , biologically relevant state .",
    "for this reason we introduced a second quantity , @xmath1 ( equation [ delta_def ] ) , a probabilistic measure of the change in the fixed point after perturbation .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 reflects the change in the biological relevance of the basin structure .     after class ii perturbation ( removed arrows ) .",

    ", we find that @xmath1-distribution ( figure 2b ) is bimodal , showing two distinct populations of perturbations : ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) . in the second case",
    ", the perturbed model does not reproduce the biologically correct cell - cycle progression .",
    "but if @xmath1 is small , then the system of attractors of the perturbed network is still consistent with the biology and entropy allows to discriminate between networks with a larger or smaller main basin of attraction .",
    "for this reason , the entropy and @xmath1 are complementary for describing the dynamical landscape ( figure 2c ) .",
    "the two different modes in the @xmath1-histogram are clearly reflected on this 2d representation .",
    "noticeably , the @xmath1 values span a broad range for any number of removed arrows , on the other hand higher entropies are more frequent for larger number ( @xmath36 ) of removed arrows .",
    "qualitatively , the spread of points in the @xmath37 plane conveys a measure of _",
    "robustness_. accordingly , the @xmath1 measure appears more fragile than the entropy property , especially when few arrows are removed .",
    "we now interpret the different locations in the @xmath37 plane : + 1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is large ( @xmath35 ) , the model does have attractor states which coincide with the gene activities of the different cell - cycles phases .",
    "such perturbations are specially interesting if the number of removed arrows is small ( dark colors ) .",
    "such links are then essential for the model , as their removal disrupts the cell - cycle very efficiently .",
    "+ 2 . if @xmath1 is small and the entropy increases , the probability that the dynamics ends in the reference attractor decreases demonstrating that the removed arrows contributed to the channeling properties of the system .",
    "if @xmath1 is small and the entropy decreases , the main attractor of the perturbed network has a stronger attraction property .",
    "some of these networks could be considered as alternative cell - cycle models .",
    "+ we illustrate these three regimes by examples :      in the first example ( table ii ) , the dynamics has a large main basin of attraction like in the unperturbed model ( table i ) .",
    "however , the fixed point is significantly different from wild - type as the system is blocked in the a state of the m - phase and can not finish properly the cell - cycle ( see appendix for the recapitulation of the wild - type mode from @xcite ) .    .",
    "basins of attraction with their respective probabilities in ( @xmath38 ) for the original ycc network .",
    "the largest basin ends at the g1 stationary state .",
