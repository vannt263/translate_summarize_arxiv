    "the rare decay mode @xmath0 has been the subject of many discussions @xcite . the current interest in this mode arises because experiment e871 at brookhaven national laboratory expects to collect a sample of about @xmath5 events @xcite . theoretically , the interest in this decay mode focuses almost exclusively in the possibility of extracting constraints on @xmath6 in the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix .",
    "violation @xcite . ]    the measured rate can be attributed to the sum of an absorptive part arising from a two - photon intermediate state , and a real part arising from the coherent sum of the dispersive contribution of the two photon intermediate state and a short distance contribution that depends on @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , to extract information on @xmath6 , one must be able to calculate reliably the dispersive contribution associated with the two photon intermediate state .",
    "the short distance contribution to this process has been known for quite some time @xcite . a recent review that presents all the relevant details of the status of this calculation",
    "@xcite . for our purposes",
    "it will suffice to quote an approximate result for @xmath7  gev and @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath10 is a measure of the charm - quark contribution to this decay .    in order to discuss the two - photon contribution , it is convenient to normalize the decay rate to the two - photon mode .",

    "taking into account that the total rate must be greater than or equal to the absorptive contribution , we can write : @xmath17    there exist several models in the literature that allow one to estimate the size of the long distance two - photon contribution .",
    "however , these models do not provide a reliable estimate of the uncertainty in their predictions .",
    "nevertheless , a recent paper @xcite claims to obtain a reliable estimate of the magnitude and uncertainty of the two - photon contribution and from this a lower bound on @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the issue of the two - photon long distance contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "we first use the framework of chiral perturbation theory to parameterize the dispersive part of the two - photon contribution in terms of one unknown combination of constants .",
    "we argue that this combination can not be measured in any other process and , therefore , that it is not possible to remove the uncertainty .",
    "we then turn our attention to a simple pole model for the @xmath18 vertex that we use to discuss some of the model calculations that have appeared in the literature and to offer an estimate for the uncertainty of the result .",
    "finally , we discuss a slightly more complicated model that illustrates why a more precise measurement of the decay parameters in @xmath19 will not reduce the uncertainty in the dispersive two - photon contribution to @xmath20 . we conclude that it is not possible at present to extract information on the short distance parameter @xmath6 from the measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "to calculate the dispersive part of the two - photon intermediate state it is not sufficient to know the @xmath21 amplitude on shell , so we parameterize the @xmath22 vertex in the following way : @xmath23 the overall constant , with @xmath24 , has been chosen for convenience @xcite . with this normalization ,",

    "it is important to emphasize that it would be valuable to have a direct fit to these parameters from the experiments , instead of the fit to the parameter @xmath40 that is currently performed .",
    "this was already suggested in references  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the measured values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , justify the way we wrote the low energy expansion in eq .  [ expandf ] .",

    "the leading contributions appear at order @xmath44 , and this implies that , formally , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are of the same order . to be truly consistent with @xmath45pt we should write @xmath46 instead of one in the first term of eq .",

    "we have used a class of models that can accommodate the measured low - energy behavior of said vertex while allowing us to vary the form factor in the region near the chiral symmetry breaking scale . from this exercise",
    "we find that , the main source of uncertainty in @xmath92 _ does not _ arise from the error in the measurement of @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , we find that even if the low energy behavior of the @xmath145 vertex is precisely measured ( in our parameterization this means that @xmath42 and @xmath38 are well measured ) , the uncertainty arising from the energy region that is not accessible to experiment is sufficiently large to make @xmath92 impossible to predict .",
