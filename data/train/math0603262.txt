    "let @xmath14 be a real closed field and @xmath15 a semi - algebraic set defined by a boolean formula with atoms of the form @xmath16 for @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "it is known @xcite that the topological complexity of @xmath1 ( measured by the various betti numbers of @xmath1 ) is bounded by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 note that these bounds are singly exponential in @xmath10 .",
    "more precise bounds on the individual betti numbers of @xmath1 appear in @xcite . designing efficient algorithms for computing the homology groups , and in particular the betti numbers , of semi - algebraic sets",
    "are considered amongst the most important problems in algorithmic semi - algebraic geometry .    even though the betti numbers of @xmath1 are bounded singly exponentially in @xmath10 , there is no known algorithm for producing a singly exponential sized triangulation of @xmath1 ( which would immediately imply a singly exponential algorithm for computing the betti numbers of @xmath1 ) .",
    "in fact , the existence of a singly exponential sized triangulation , is considered to be a major open question in real algebraic geometry . doubly exponential algorithms ( with complexity @xmath21 ) for computing all the betti numbers are known , since it is possible to obtain a triangulation of @xmath1 in doubly exponential time using cylindrical algebraic decomposition . in the absence of singly exponential algorithms for computing triangulations of semi - algebraic sets , singly exponential algorithms are known only for the problems of testing emptiness @xcite , computing the zero - th betti number ( i.e. the number of semi - algebraically connected components of @xmath1 ) @xcite , as well as the euler - poincar characteristic of @xmath1 @xcite . very recently",
    "a singly exponential time algorithm has been given for computing the first few betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we consider a restricted class of semi - algebraic sets ",
    "namely , semi - algebraic sets defined by a conjunction of quadratic inequalities .",
    "since sets defined by linear inequalities have no interesting topology , sets defined by quadratic inequalities can be considered to be the simplest class of semi - algebraic sets which can have non - trivial topology .",
    "such sets are in fact quite general , since every semi - algebraic set can be defined by ( quantified ) formulas involving only quadratic polynomials ( at the cost of increasing the number of variables and the size of the formula ) . moreover , as in the case of general semi - algebraic sets , the betti numbers of such sets can be exponentially large .",
    "for example , the set @xmath15 defined by @xmath22 has @xmath23 .",
    "hence , it is somewhat surprising that for any fixed constant @xmath5 , the betti numbers @xmath24 , of a basic closed semi - algebraic set @xmath15 defined by quadratic inequalities , are polynomially bounded .",
    "the following theorem appears in @xcite .",
    "[ the : quadratic ] let @xmath14 a real closed field and @xmath15 be defined by @xmath25 then , for @xmath26 , @xmath27    notice that for fixed @xmath5 this gives a polynomial bound on the highest @xmath5 betti numbers of @xmath1 ( which could possibly be non - zero ) .",
    "observe also that similar bounds do not hold for sets defined by polynomials of degree greater than two .",
    "for instance , the set @xmath28 defined by the single quartic inequality , @xmath29 will have @xmath30 , for all small enough @xmath31 .    to see this",
    "observe that for all sufficiently small @xmath31 , @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 and has @xmath34 connected components , since it retracts onto the set @xmath35 .",
    "it now follows by alexander duality that @xmath36    even though theorem [ the : quadratic ] is stated for semi - algebraic sets defined by a conjunction of weak inequalities , there is an easy reduction to this case for basic semi - algebraic sets defined by equalities and strict inequalities .",
    "the same reduction is also applicable to the algorithmic results described later in this paper , in particular theorem [ the : main ] .",
    "note that the definition of cohomology groups of basic semi - algebraic sets defined by equalities and strict inequalities over an arbitrary real closed field @xmath14 requires some care , and several possibilities exist . in this paper",
    "we follow the definition given in @xcite which agrees with singular cohomology in case @xmath37 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further elaboration on this point .",
    "we have the following easy corollary of theorem [ the : quadratic ] .",
    "[ cor : quadratic ] let @xmath14 a real closed field and @xmath15 be defined by @xmath38 with @xmath39 for each @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "then , for all @xmath26 , @xmath27    in the following proof , as well as later in the paper , we will extend the ground field @xmath14 by infinitesimal elements .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the real closed field of algebraic puiseux series in @xmath43 with coefficients in @xmath14 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the sign of a puiseux series in @xmath42 agrees with the sign of the coefficient of the lowest degree term in @xmath43 .",
    "this induces a unique order on @xmath42 which makes @xmath43 infinitesimal : @xmath43 is positive and smaller than any positive element of @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath44 is bounded from above and below by some elements of @xmath14 , @xmath45 is the constant term of @xmath46 , obtained by substituting 0 for @xmath43 in @xmath46 . given a semi - algebraic set @xmath1 in @xmath47 , the _ extension _ of @xmath1 to @xmath48 , denoted @xmath49 is the semi - algebraic subset of @xmath50 defined by the same quantifier free formula that defines @xmath1 .",
    "the set @xmath51 is well defined ( i.e. it only depends on the set @xmath1 and not on the quantifier free formula chosen to describe it ) .",
    "this is an easy consequence of the transfer principle ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath52 be infinitesimals .",
    "we first replace the set @xmath1 by the set @xmath53 defined by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the closed ball of radius @xmath56 centered at the origin .",
    "it follows from hardt s triviality theorem for semi - algebraic mappings @xcite that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "we then replace @xmath59 by the set @xmath60 defined by , @xmath61 it follows from hardt s triviality again that , @xmath62 for all @xmath58",
    ". now apply theorem [ the : quadratic ] .",
    "another point to note is that the bound in theorem [ the : quadratic ] depends crucially on the structure of the formula defining the semi - algebraic set @xmath1  namely that @xmath1 is defined by a _ conjunction _ of polynomial inequalities of the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the polynomial bound on the highest betti numbers no longer holds if @xmath1 is defined by a formula involving quadratic inequalities but having a different structure  for instance , a disjunction instead of a conjunction of such inequalities . however , the polynomial bound continues to hold for certain small variations of the structure of the formula defining @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , we have the following slight generalization of theorem [ the : quadratic ] whose proof mimics that of theorem [ the : quadratic ] and which we omit .",
    "[ the : quadratic2 ] let @xmath14 a real closed field and @xmath15 be defined by @xmath65 then , for @xmath26 , @xmath66    for fixed @xmath67 and @xmath5 , the above bound is still polynomial in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the main result of this paper , namely algorithm [ alg : general ] in section [ sec : general ] , can be extended to this situation as well with complexity polynomial in @xmath9 and @xmath10 for fixed @xmath67 and @xmath5 .",
    "we will omit the details of this extension .",
    "semi - algebraic sets defined by a system of quadratic inequalities have a special significance in the theory of computational complexity .",
    "even though such sets might seem to be the next simplest class of semi - algebraic sets after sets defined by linear inequalities , from the point of view of computational complexity they represent a quantum leap . whereas there exist ( weakly ) polynomial time algorithms for solving linear programming , solving quadratic feasibility problem is provably hard .",
    "for instance , it follows from an easy reduction from the problem of testing feasibility of a real quartic equation in many variables , that the problem of testing whether a system of quadratic inequalities is feasible is @xmath68-complete in the blum - shub - smale model of computation ( see @xcite ) . assuming the input polynomials to have integer coefficients , the same problem is np - hard in the classical turing machine model , since it is also not difficult to see that the boolean satisfiability problem can be posed as the problem of deciding whether a certain semi - algebraic set defined by quadratic inequalities is empty or not ( see section [ sec : hardness ] ) . counting",
    "the number of connected components of such sets is even harder .",
    "in fact , we prove ( see theorem [ the : hardness ] ) that for @xmath69 , computing the @xmath5-th betti number of a basic semi - algebraic set defined by quadratic inequalities in @xmath11 is @xmath70p - hard .",
    "note that pspace - hardness of the problem of counting the number of connected components for general semi - algebraic sets were known before @xcite , and the proofs of these results extend easily to the quadratic case . in view of these hardness results , it is unlikely that there exist polynomial time algorithms for computing the betti numbers ( or even the first few betti numbers ) of such a set .",
    "in contrast to these hardness results , the polynomial bound on the top betti numbers of sets defined by quadratic inequalities gives rise to the possibility that these might in fact be computable in polynomial time .    in this paper",
    "we prove that for each fixed @xmath0 , the top @xmath5 betti numbers of basic semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities are computable in polynomial time .",
    "we will assume that the polynomials given as input to our algorithms have coefficients in some ordered domain @xmath71 contained in a real closed field @xmath14 .",
    "we will denote the algebraic closure of @xmath14 by @xmath72 . by complexity of our algorithms",
    "we will mean the number of arithmetic operations including comparisons in the ring @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath73 , we will also count the number of bit operations .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "+ * main result : * we present an algorithm ( algorithm [ alg : general ] in section [ sec : general ] ) which given a set of @xmath9 polynomials , @xmath74,$ ] with @xmath75 computes @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the set defined by @xmath2 .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm is @xmath76 if the coefficients of the polynomials in @xmath77 are integers of bitsizes bounded by @xmath78 , then the bitsizes of the integers appearing in the intermediate computations and the output are bounded by @xmath79    to our knowledge this is the first polynomial time algorithm for computing a non - trivial topological invariant of semi - algebraic sets in @xmath11 defined by polynomial inequalities , where the number of constraints is not fixed and the polynomials are allowed to have degree greater than @xmath80 .",
    "the special case when all the polynomials are linear reduces to the well - studied problem of linear programming . in this case",
    "the set @xmath1 is either a convex polyhedron or empty , and ( weakly ) polynomial time algorithms are known to decide emptiness of such a set . in another direction , barvinok @xcite designed a polynomial time algorithm for deciding feasibility of systems of quadratic inequalities , but under the condition that the number of inequalities is bounded by a constant ( see also @xcite for an interesting generalization as well as a constructive version of this result ) .",
    "given any compact semi - algebraic set @xmath1 , we will denote by @xmath81 the rank of @xmath82 ( the @xmath83-th simplicial cohomology group of @xmath1 with coefficients in @xmath84 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath85 the unit sphere centered at the origin .",
    "we first consider the case of semi - algebraic subsets of the unit sphere , @xmath86 defined by homogeneous quadratic inequalities .",
    "we then show how to reduce the general problem to this special case .",
    "let @xmath87 be the set defined on @xmath88 by @xmath9 inequalities , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 $ ] are homogeneous quadratic polynomials . for each @xmath91 ,",
    "let @xmath92 denote the set defined on @xmath88 by @xmath93 .",
    "then , @xmath94 there are two main ingredients in the polynomial time algorithm for computing the top betti numbers of @xmath1 .",
    "the first main idea is to consider @xmath1 as the intersection of the various @xmath95 s and to utilize the double complex arising from the generalized mayer - vietoris exact sequence ( see section [ sec : top_prelim ] ) .",
    "it follows from the exactness of the generalized mayer - vietoris sequence ( see proposition [ prop : gmv ] below ) , that the top dimensional homology groups of @xmath1 are isomorphic to those of the total complex associated to a suitable truncation of the mayer - vietoris double complex .",
    "however , computing even the truncation of the mayer - vietoris double complex , starting from a triangulation of @xmath1 would entail a doubly exponential complexity",
    ". however , we utilize the fact that terms appearing in the truncated complex depend on the unions of the @xmath95 s taken at most @xmath96 at a time . there are at most @xmath97 such sets . moreover , for semi - algebraic sets defined by the disjunction of a small number of quadratic inequalities , we are able to compute in polynomial ( in @xmath10 ) time a complex , whose homology groups are isomorphic to those of the given sets .",
    "the construction of these complexes in polynomial time is the second important ingredient in our algorithm and is described in detail in section [ sec : main ] ( algorithm [ alg : union ] ) .",
    "these complexes along with the homomorphisms between them define another double complex whose associated spectral sequence ( corresponding to the column - wise filtration ) is isomorphic from the @xmath98 term onwards to the corresponding one of the ( truncated ) mayer - vietoris double complex ( see theorem [ the : main ] below ) . since , we know that the latter converges to the homology groups of @xmath1 , the top betti numbers of @xmath1 are equal to the ranks of the homology groups of the associated total complex of the double complex we computed .",
    "these can then be computed using well known efficient algorithms from linear algebra .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : top_prelim ] we recall certain basic facts from algebraic topology including the notions of complexes , and double complexes of vector spaces , spectral sequences and triangulations of semi - algebraic sets .",
    "we do not prove any results since all of them are quite classical and we refer the reader to appropriate references @xcite for the proofs . in section [ sec : algo_prelim ] , we recall some basic algorithms in semi - algebraic geometry that we will need later .",
    "we state the inputs , outputs and complexities of these algorithms . for classical results in the field of real algebraic geometry , as well as the details of certain algorithms that we use ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for convenience . in section [ sec : top_quadratic ]",
    "we describe certain topological properties of semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities which are crucial for our algorithm .",
    "most of the results in this section are due to agrachev @xcite . in section [ sec : comp ] we prove the main mathematical results necessary for our algorithm . in section [ sec : main ] we describe our algorithm for computing the top betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic forms .",
    "we treat the general case in section [ sec : general ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : hardness ] , we show the computational hardness of computing the first few betti numbers of a given semi - algebraic set defined by quadratic inequalities , by proving that the problem is @xmath70p - hard .",
