    "singularities of map germs have long been studied , especially up to the equivalence under coordinate changes in both source and target ( @xmath0-equivalence ) . according to @xcite , `` classification '' for map germs with @xmath0-equivalence means finding lists of germs , and showing that all germs satisfying certain conditions are equivalent to a germ on the list .",
    "classification is well understood , with many good references in the literature .",
    "`` recognition '' means finding criteria which will describe which germ on the list a given germ is equivalent to ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the classification problem and recognition problem for map germs from the plane into the plane up to @xmath0-equivalence was studied by j. h. rieger @xcite .",
    "he classified map germs @xmath1 with corank one and @xmath2-codimension @xmath3 .",
    "table [ tab : rie ] shows the list of the @xmath2-codimension @xmath4 local singularities obtained in @xcite .",
    "some of these singularities are also called as follows : @xmath5 ( _ lips _ ) , @xmath6 ( _ beaks _ ) , @xmath7 ( _ swallowtail _ ) . these singularities are depicted in figure [ fig : lipetc ] .",
    "rieger also discussed the recognition of these map germs after normalizing the coordinate system as @xmath8 .",
    "however , for applications , criteria of recognition without using normalization are not only more convenient but also indispensable in some cases ."
