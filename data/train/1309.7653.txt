    "<S> in this snowmass whitepaper , we describe the impact of ongoing and proposed intensity frontier experiments on the parameter space of the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we extend a set of phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) models to include non - zero cp - violating phases and study the sensitivity of various flavor observables in these scenarios future electric dipole moment and rare meson decay experiments can have a strong impact on the viability of these models that is relatively independent of the detailed superpartner spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that these experiments have the potential to probe models that are expected to escape searches at the high - luminosity lhc .    the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has reached a major milestone by discovering a higgs boson@xcite . at present , the properties of this higgs boson resemble those predicted by the standard model , but the naturalness of the electroweak scale remains unexplained . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry ( susy ) in general , and its minimal version , the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in particular , explains this scale and is among the best - motivated theory of physics beyond the sm . </S>",
    "<S> many of the lhc searches have focused on its signatures , with null results so far , and the large lhc dataset is pushing the limits on the scale of new physics ( np ) to roughly a tev . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus paramount that signatures of supersymmetry be studied in all possible manners , including its indirect effects at the intensity frontier .    </S>",
    "<S> if no assumptions are made about the susy breaking sector then the total number of unknown parameters ( the so called soft susy breaking parameters ) in the r - parity conserving version of the mssm is large ( 105 ) , and it becomes difficult to carry out a phenomenological analysis . in order to circumvent this , two complementary approaches are generally taken .    the first common approach is to assume particular patterns for many of the parameters at some high scale . </S>",
    "<S> the soft parameters at the electroweak scale are then generated by renormalization group ( rg ) evolution from the high scale . </S>",
    "<S> while these minimal models make the phenomenological analysis comparatively straightforward , they do not represent the full set of susy signatures and they are now tightly constrained by a host of experimental observables and direct searches . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , two of the most commonly studied scenarios , the minimal super gravity ( msugra ) and minimal gauge mediated susy breaking ( mgmsb ) models @xcite , are now severely constrained by the lhc data@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternate approach is to maintain ignorance of the physics at the high scale , and to choose a pattern for the parameters at the weak scale based on current experimental constraints . </S>",
    "<S> a study of such models is only feasible because many of these parameters are already tightly constrained by a host of low energy measurements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , both the charge - parity ( cp ) conserving and cp - violating observables in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays , as well as lepton flavor violating decays and data on electric and magnetic dipole moments , already forbid large values of new cp - violating phases and sfermion mixing angles .    </S>",
    "<S> taking the limit of no new sources of flavor- or cp - violation leads to the general 19/20-parameter pmssm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increased dimensionality of the parameter space not only allows for a more unprejudiced study of susy , but can also yield valuable information on ` unusual ' scenarios , identify weaknesses in the current lhc analyses and provides the means to combine results obtained from many independent susy - related searches . to these ends , we have recently embarked on a detailed study of the signatures for the pmssm at the 7 and 8 tev lhc , supplemented by input from dark matter ( dm ) experiments as well as from precision measurements of the higgs properties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pmssm is the most general version of the r - parity conserving mssm when it is subjected to a minimal set of experimentally - motivated guiding principles : ( @xmath3 ) no new sources of cp - violation , ( @xmath4 ) minimal flavor violation at the electroweak scale so that flavor violation is proportional to the ckm mixing matrix elements , ( @xmath5 ) degenerate 1^st^ and 2^nd^ generation sfermion masses , and ( @xmath6 ) negligible yukawa couplings and a - terms for the first two generations . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , no assumptions are made about physics at high scales , e.g. , the nature of susy breaking , in order to capture electroweak scale phenomenology for which a uv - complete theory may not yet exist . </S>",
    "<S> imposing these principles ( @xmath3)-(@xmath6 ) decreases the number of free parameters in the mssm at the tev scale from 105 to 19 for the case of a neutralino lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp ) , or to 20 when the gravitino mass is included as an additional parameter when it plays the role of the lsp . </S>",
    "<S> we have not assumed that the lsp relic density necessarily saturates the wmap / planck value@xcite in order to allow for the possibility of multi - component dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the axions introduced to solve the strong cp problem may make up a substantial amount of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the 19/20 pmssm parameters and the ranges of values employed in our scans are listed in table  [ scanranges ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are all given a randomly chosen sign . </S>",
    "<S> like throwing darts , to study the pmssm we generate @xmath10 million model points in this space ( using softsusy@xcite and check for consistency with suspect@xcite ) , with each point corresponding to a specific set of values for these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these individual models are then subjected to a global set of collider , flavor , precision measurement , dark matter and theoretical constraints  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> roughly @xmath11225k models with either type of lsp survive this initial selection and can then be used for further physics studies . </S>",
    "<S> decay patterns of the susy partners and the extended higgs sector are calculated using privately modified versions of susy - hit  @xcite , calchep  @xcite , and madgraph  @xcite . since our </S>",
    "<S> scan ranges include sparticle masses up to 4 tev , an upper limit chosen by kinematics to enable phenomenological studies at the 14 tev lhc , the neutralinos and charginos in either of our model sets are typically very close to being in a pure electroweak eigenstate as the off - diagonal elements of the corresponding mass matrices are at most @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> .scan ranges for the 19 ( 20 ) parameters of the pmssm with a neutralino ( gravitino ) lsp . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitino mass is scanned with a log prior . </S>",
    "<S> all other parameters are scanned with flat priors , though we expect this choice to have little qualitative impact on our results  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      bounds.,width=297 ]    the results of this scan are summarized in figures [ fig : vphases ] and [ fig : vobs ] for various flavor- and cp - violating observables . </S>",
    "<S> current experimental bounds at the @xmath13 level are represented by solid lines . </S>",
    "<S> projected future sensitivities are indicated by dashed lines , using @xmath13 limits for the most aggressive experimental scenarios described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both sets of limits are summarized in table [ tab : sflav_observables ] . as expected for models with wino or higgsino lsps </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the cp - violating observables are most sensitive to the phases of @xmath14 and @xmath8 and therefore we only show the dependence on these phases . </S>",
    "<S> the edm searches for the neutron and electron are seen to be complementary : there are many models for which only one of the two most sensitive observables is large . </S>",
    "<S> the branching fractions for the rare kaon decays demonstrate the well - known mfv linear relationship @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any deviation from this would be a signature of non - minimal flavor violation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we see that there is no correlation between the edm values and the rare kaon decays .    only the most sensitve observables are shown in these figures . </S>",
    "<S> additional weaker constraints can be obtained from @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions for the two different sets of models , those to which the lhc is expected to have sensitivity and those to which it is not , are comparable and we do not separate the two sets in figures [ fig : vphases ] and [ fig : vobs ] . in all cases , we find that the expected reach for these observables has sensitivity to models that can not be probed at the high luminosity lhc , provided that the cp - violating phases do not vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> the future for both cp - violating and flavor - violating observables is exciting . </S>",
    "<S> experiments are slated to improve by several orders of magnitude in sensitivity and will have a significant impact on the available parameter space , even for models to which the lhc is unlikely to be sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> this work demonstrates the powerful and complementary role that such probes can play in the hunt for new physics . </S>"
