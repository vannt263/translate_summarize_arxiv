    "many optical phenomena in nature , such as mirage and rainbow , can be explained in terms of refraction of light rays in an inhomogeneous optical medium @xcite .",
    "the theoretical approach can be developed from fermat s principle , saying that a light ray with a given frequency traverses the path between two points which takes the least time .",
    "fermat s principle is consistent with light traveling in a straight line in a medium with homogenous refraction index .",
    "classically , refraction of light results from the spatial inhomogeneity of refraction index caused by the inhomogeneity of medium density . in this article",
    "we show that the quantum coherence of optical medium even with homogenous density can also result in a spatially inhomogeneous refraction index and thus various phenomena on refraction of light .",
    "light deflection by an atomic medium in external fields has been studied experimentally in the last two decades @xcite . a most recent experiment with a rubidium atomic gas @xcite",
    "was carried out to demonstrate how the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite enhances the light deflection in a @xmath0- type three - level atomic medium .",
    "remarkably , if a magnetic field with some gradient is applied to the gas cell , and the signal light and the control light satisfies the frequency matching condition to realize the eit , the signal light will transmit perfectly through the atomic media with a very slow group velocity , and thus be deflected with an angle proportional to its propagation time through the gas cell .",
    "a signal light can be deflected not only by atomic media in a nonuniform magnetic field , but also by an atomic medium coherently driven by an inhomogeneous laser field , which is shown in another recent experiment @xcite . as an ultra - dispersive optical prism ,",
    "such coherence enhanced media has an angular dispersion which is six orders of magnitude higher than that of a prism made of optical glass .",
    "the light deflection phenomenon observed in ref .",
    "@xcite was explained in terms of the dark polariton concept @xcite , in which the quantized signal light field dresses the atomic collective excitation to form a quasi - particle  the polariton with an effective magnetic moment .",
    "then , the experimental result could be understood as a stern - gerlach experiment for the quasi - particle .",
    "it worths noticing that , in this explanation , the signal light must be assumed as a quantized field .     and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "( b ) schematic diagram of light deflection in the atomic medium : a transverse magnetic field gradient causes inhomogeneity of the refraction index of the medium via eit and then deflection of the signal light beam.,width=321 ]    in this paper we present a semi - classical theory to uniformly treat light deflection phenomena by a coherent @xmath0-type three - level atomic medium in various external fields .",
    "note that the eit enhances spatial dependence of the refraction index of the atomic medium , which results from the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field or the control laser field .",
    "we thus apply the fermat s principle to calculate the signal light path in such coherent medium where the quantization of the signal light is not necessary to account for the experiments .",
    "our theory is semi - classical since the atoms are described quantum mechanically , while both the two laser fields are treated classically .",
    "this approach not only provides a consistent explanation for the experiment kw06 in a straightforward way , but also predicts the new effects for the weak light deflection by an atomic media driven by an optical laser with inhomogeneous profile .",
    "this situation with weak probe light is essentially different from the current experiment about  ultra - dispersive optical prism \"",
    "@xcite , where the strength of the probe light is as strong as that of the control light , and thus the linear suspensibility obtained for weak probe light will not be enough to account for the data of the experiment .",
    "as shown in fig . 1 ( a ) , the system under consideration is an atomic gas cell filled with @xmath2-type three - level atoms with an upper level @xmath3 and two lower levels latexmath:[$%    @xmath3 to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the level splitting between @xmath3 and @xmath7 ( between @xmath3 and @xmath8 ) is denoted as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath7 are coupled by a weaker ` signal ' field with the frequency @xmath11 , while @xmath3 and @xmath12 .",
    "the detunings of these two transitions are denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath1 respectively , which are defined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the linear susceptibility of the medium for the weak signal light can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath16 where the constant @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the density of atomic gas , @xmath19 is the matrix element between the states @xmath3 and @xmath7 of the dipole operator , @xmath20 is the rabi frequency of the control light , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the two - photon detuning .    in deriving eq .",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) , the one - photon detuning @xmath13 , the two - photon detuning @xmath23 , and the rabi coupling @xmath20 are assumed to be independent of spatial position .",
    "when the external fields exerted on the atomic gas are inhomogeneous , such as in the experiments @xcite , the above parameters will become spatial dependent , which are denoted as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "let us assume that the atomic gas cell can be divided into many smaller cells , each smaller cell containing a large number of atoms and the inhomogeneous external field being sufficiently homogenous for each smaller cell .",
    "thus we can apply eq .",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) to each smaller cell by changing the values of the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath23 , and @xmath20 for different cells . when the inhomogenous external fields are exerted on the atomic gas , under the above approximation , the linear susceptibility in eq .",

    "the refraction index is approximated as @xmath30    once the refraction index @xmath31 is known , the trajectory of a light ray propagating in the atomic medium can be obtained by solving the the differential equation @xcite @xmath32=\\nabla n(\\vec{r } ) , \\label{patheq}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 . inserting eq .",

    "( [ chir ] ) and ( [ patheq1 ] ) to determine the light ray trajectory and the corresponding deflection angle .    to demonstrate this procedure ,",
    "let us consider an example related to the experiments to be studied later .",
    "we assume that the signal light injects at the position @xmath35 along @xmath36 axis . to further simplify the calculation , we approximate the gradient of the linear susceptibility along the light trajectory to be that at the incident point , and the direction of this gradient along @xmath37 axis , namely , @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the unit vector along @xmath37 axis",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ patheq1 ] ) allows an analytic solution of the light ray path @xmath40 when the light ray exits the atomic gas cell , we have @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the length along @xmath36 direction of the atomic gas cell .",
    "the length of light path in the atomic medium is then given by @xmath43 , and we finally arrive at the light deflection angle @xmath44 where the last equality is satisfied only when @xmath45 , which is satisfied throughout this paper .",
    "here we study the deflection of a weak signal light under a spatially inhomogeneous control light @xmath26 . at first sight",
    ", this model may look similar to that considered in experiment ref .",
    "however , after carefully examing the experimental parameters , we realized that the experiment was performed using a stronger signal light , for which the linear susceptibility theory is insufficient and the experimental results can not be explained using our semi - classical theory in the present formulation .    in the absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the two - photon detuning @xmath46 is position independent .",
    "we further assume that the driving light has a gaussian profile @xmath47with @xmath48 characterizing the width of the profile . from eq .",
    "( [ chir ] ) , one can easily obtain the linear susceptibility for the signal light to be @xmath49an immediate consequence of the above equation is that the light is undeflected if the two photon detuning @xmath23 is set to zero .",
    "this result clearly distinguishes our model from the experimentally studied case  @xcite , where a significant light deflection was observed even at resonance . for @xmath50 case",
    ", we consider the situation where the signal light is sufficiently weak compared to the control light and in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "for the signal lights incident onto the medium at @xmath52 and along the positive @xmath36-axis within the region @xmath53 , we have @xmath54eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) immediately yields the deflection angle @xmath55it follows from the above equation that , for @xmath56 , a red detuned signal light ( @xmath57 ) feels an attractive potential `` toward @xmath58 axis ; while a blue detuned light ( @xmath59 ) experiences a repulsive potential '' . at @xmath60",
    ", the signal light is undeflected irrespective of its detuning .",
    "we also note that the deflection angle increase when @xmath61 becomes weaker .",
    "these novel light deflection phenomena are schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "the three cases with detuning @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are denoted by red , green , and blue color respectively .",
    "corresponding to these three cases the light rays with incidents in different positions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 will possesses different deflection ways . , width=5 ]    to get a quantitative idea about the deflection angle , we calculate @xmath68 using the optimal experimental parameters given in refs.@xcite . for example , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ defang4 ] , we see that the deflection angle becomes larger as the inject position @xmath73 increases . note that this result is valid only when the intensity of the local control light @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , the deflection angle increases linearly with the two - photon detuning @xmath23 .",
    "the deflection angle can reach @xmath75 , which is three orders larger than that in the previous experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , these interesting predictions are experimentally observable , and can be explicitly tested by tuning the frequency of the signal light and ( or ) the incidence position @xmath37 of the signal light .",

    "slrs07 can not be directly explained using the semiclassical theory based on susceptibility formula eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) . to fully account for the experimental results , a different mechanism based on quantum coherence should be considered . since",
    "both the signal light and the control field are strong , there should be the coherent population trapping for the atoms with the eit configuration @xcite , which will result in the nonlinear response for the eit like effect .",
    "it is believed that a refined theoretical approach accounting for the strong signal light , and connecting the quantum interferences of the atomic transitions is required .",
    "for the next example , we present a semiclassical explanation for the light deflection by a coherent atomic medium subjected to an inhomogeneous magnetic field kw06 , where the rabi frequency @xmath20 are uniform . we consider a linearized inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath78 .",
    "thus the two photon detuning@xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bohr magneton , and we used the related spectrum data of @xmath81 @xmath82 line @xcite .",

    "( [ theta1 ] ) , we get the deflection angle @xmath88 which has exactly the same form as that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where the control light was treated quantum mechanically .",
    "our calculation , however , indicates that in weak field limit the classical treatment on the control light is capable of capturing the central result on light deflection in an eit atomic gas .",
    "note that the concept of group velocity for a light ray does not play any role in our geometric optics method .",
    "the unique purpose to derive eq .",
    "( [ theta2 ] ) is to compare eq .",
    "( [ theta1 ] ) with the known result in ref .",
    "although these two methods give the same result on light deflection angle , the physical picture are quite different . in the picture of dark polariton in ref .",
    "@xcite , the velocity of dark polariton is the group velocity @xmath89 . in the picture of light ray , however , the signal light with a given frequency propagates with the phase velocity @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , only transparent medium is considered in geometric optics @xcite .",
    "this is why we can correctly deal with the signal light deflection in the eit window , where the atomic gas is transparent to the signal light .",
    "however , when we need to further investigate the phenomena on signal light deflection , ( for example , considering the signal light frequency region outside of the eit window , or the energy - conserving dephasing process of the atomic level @xmath8 ) , the atomic medium becomes dissipative , and thus the geometric optics method will not be valid any more .",
    "a better solution is to directly solve the maxwell equations in continuous medium , which is beyond the scope of our article .",
    "in summary , we have presented a semi - classical approach to describe the light deflection in the atomic gas cell by applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field or an inhomogeneous pump optical field .",
    "our theory not only explains the experiment without quantization of the probe light , but also predicts some interesting phenomena on quantum coherence enhanced light deflection .",
    "the eit effect not only makes the atomic medium transparent near the two - photon resonance , but also makes the linear susceptibility of the atomic medium spatial dependent .",
    "it is this spatial dependent linear susceptibility that deflects the signal light ray . for applications in quantum information processing ,",
