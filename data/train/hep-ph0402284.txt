    "one of the most popular extensions of the standard model ( sm ) is the two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) , mainly because of its simplicity and consistency with the minimal realization of supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "the thdm predicts the existence of five higgs bosons : two neutral cp - even scalar bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , one neutral cp - odd scalar boson @xmath11 , and a pair of charged scalar bosons @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the detection of the charged higgs boson would be an irrefutable signal of an extended higgs sector , and its experimental study might help us to elucidate the structure of the higgs potential and shed light on the group representation of the higgs fields through the study of its couplings to the gauge boson fields . in models which only comprise singlets and doublets of higgs bosons , the decays of the charged scalar boson into a gauge boson pair , namely @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite , are absent at the tree level , though they may occur at higher orders .",
    "while the decay mode @xmath0 is forbidden at the tree level due to electromagnetic gauge invariance , the @xmath13 decay can be induced at this order in models including higgs triplets or more complicated representations @xcite . in spite of their suppressed branching ratios ,",
    "these decay modes are very interesting , which is due to the fact that their experimental study may provide important information concerning the underlying structure of the gauge and scalar sectors . apart from being rather sensitive to new physics effects @xcite",
    ", these channels have a clear signature and might be at the reach of future particle colliders .    in this work we present an evaluation of the one - loop induced decay @xmath2 in the framework of the thdm .",
    "this decay was already studied in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is a restricted case of the general thdm . at the one - loop ,",
    "the main contributions to this decay arise from the third - generation quarks @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas the bosonic sector contributes through the cp - even higgs bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 along with the @xmath16 boson .",
    "the fermionic contribution and the effects of a fourth family were studied in ref .",
    "the bosonic contribution was studied in the linear @xmath1-gauge @xcite , which is not suitable for such a calculation since gives rise to several complications that can be evaded by the use of a nonlinear @xmath1-gauge @xcite .",
    "for instance , while in the linear @xmath1-gauge one has to deal with about 100 feynman diagrams when computing the bosonic contribution @xcite , in a nonlinear @xmath1-gauge one only needs to compute 21 diagrams .",
    "as for the unitary gauge , the calculation happens to be extremely hard due to the terms arising from the longitudinal part of the gauge boson propagators @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to reevaluate the @xmath17 decay in a nonlinear @xmath1-gauge , which leads to considerably simplifications due to the fact that some unphysical vertices are removed from the interaction lagrangian .",
    "we will see that such a gauge not only reduces considerably the number of feynman diagrams but also renders manifestly gauge - invariant and ultraviolet - finite amplitudes .",
    "apart from emphasizing the advantages of using the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge , we will analyze the @xmath17 decay in some scenarios which are still consistent with the most recent bounds obtained from electroweak precision measurements .",
    "indeed , it has been argued quite recently @xcite that the parameter space of the type - ii thdm has become tightly constrained according to the last reported value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath18 @xcite , so we will concentrate essentially on the still - allowed region .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief review of the model and the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge used in our calculation are presented in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "[ decwidth ] is devoted to discuss the most interesting details of the calculation with emphasis on the facilities brought about by the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] and [ conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "finally , the feynman rules necessary for the calculation are shown in appendix [ appendix1 ] .",
    "the scalar sector of the cp - conserving thdm consists of two scalar doublets with hypercharge @xmath19 : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the most general gauge invariant potential can be written as @xcite @xmath22    it has been customary to impose the discrete symmetry @xmath23 and @xmath24 in order to avoid dangerous flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects .",
    "this symmetry is strongly violated by the terms associated with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , but it is softly violated by that associated with @xmath27 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the last term plays an important role in susy models .",
    "all of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) are essential to obtain the decoupling limit of the model , in which only one cp - even scalar boson is light . in this work",
    "we will assume that this discrete symmetry is softly violated , which means that we will take @xmath28 throughout the rest of the presentation .",
    "the scalar potential ( [ potential ] ) has to be diagonalized to yield the mass - eigenstates fields .",
    "the charged components of the doublets lead to the physical charged higgs boson and the pseudo - goldstone boson associated with the @xmath16 gauge field as follows    @xmath29    with @xmath30 , being @xmath31 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) associated with @xmath32 . on the other hand , the imaginary part of the neutral components @xmath33 define the neutral cp - odd scalar and the pseudo - goldstone boson associated with the @xmath34 gauge boson .",
    "the corresponding rotation is given by    @xmath35    whereas the real part of the neutral components @xmath36 define the cp - even higgs bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 :    @xmath37    where the mixing angle @xmath38 is given by    @xmath39    with the elements of the mass matrix being @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the masses of the charged and cp - odd scalar bosons satisfy the following expression    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the coupling constant associated with the @xmath45 group . obviously @xmath46",
    "when @xmath47 , which is a reflect of the underlying custodial symmetry .",
    "we now would like to comment on the gauge - fixing procedure which was used to simplify our calculation .",
    "to this end we introduce the following gauge - fixing functions @xcite :    @xmath48    with @xmath49 the electromagnetic covariant derivative and @xmath50 the gauge parameter .",
    "note that @xmath51 is nonlinear and transforms covariantly under the electromagnetic gauge group .",
    "this gauge - fixing procedure is suited to remove the unphysical vertices @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which arise in the higgs kinetic - energy sector , and also modifies the yang - mills sector .",
    "one important result is that the expression for the @xmath54 vertex satisfies a qed - like ward identity , which turns out to be very useful in loop calculations .",
    "in particular , in the feynman - thooft gauge the feynman rule for the @xmath55 coupling can be written as    @xmath56    where all the momenta are incoming .",
    "it is easy to see that this expression satisfies a qed - like ward identity .",
    "the remaining feynman rules necessary for our calculation do not depend on the gauge fixing procedure . for completeness they are presented in appendix [ appendix1 ] . as far",
    "as the yukawa couplings are concerned , we will concentrate on the type - ii thdm , in which the up - type quarks couple to the first higgs doublet whereas the remaining fermions couple to the second one .",
    "in the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge , the decay @xmath2 receives contributions from the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ hwgdiag ] . as far as the fermionic sector is concerned , the main contribution comes from the third - generation quarks , which induce three diagrams , whereas in the bosonic sector there are contributions from the ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath58 ) pairs , with @xmath59 or @xmath10 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge considerably simplifies the calculation of the @xmath17 decay .",
    "first of all , the removal of the unphysical vertex @xmath60 , allows one to get rid of all those diagrams which are displayed in fig . 2 and do have to be calculated in the linear @xmath1-gauge .",
    "even more , in the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge the tadpole graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ tadpole ] vanish . apart from these simplifications",
    ", we will be able to group the feynman diagrams into subsets which separately yield a manifestly gauge - invariant amplitude free of ultraviolet singularities .",

    "[ hwgdiag ] was written down , the passarino - veltman method @xcite was applied to express it in terms of scalar integrals , which are suitable for numerical evaluation @xcite .",
    "the full amplitude for the decay @xmath73 can be written as    @xmath74    which is manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "the @xmath75 function only receives contributions from the quarks :    @xmath76    @xmath77    where we have introduced the shorthand notation @xmath78 , @xmath79 , , @xmath80 must be substituted by 0 . ] and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 stand for passarino - veltman scalar integrals .",
    "in addition , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , etc . from the @xmath86 definition",
    ", it is clear that the @xmath75 function is ultraviolet finite . as for @xmath87",
    ", it can be written as    @xmath88    where @xmath89 stands for the contribution of the @xmath90 pair :    @xmath91    @xmath92    @xmath93    and @xmath94 with    @xmath95    @xmath96    and @xmath97    finally , the contribution of the heaviest cp - even scalar boson @xmath10 is obtained from that of the lightest one once the substitutions @xmath98 and @xmath99 are done .",
    "the above expressions are very simple and should be compared to those presented in refs .",
    "it is also evident that the partial amplitudes induced by the pairs @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are gauge invariant and ultraviolet finite on their own .",
    "again , this is to be contrasted with the situation arising in the linear @xmath1-gauge , where showing gauge invariance is somewhat cumbersome , and the cancellation of ultraviolet divergences in the bosonic sector is achieved only after adding up all the feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) is squared and the spins of the final particles are summed over , the decay width can be written as    @xmath104    we will evaluate this decay width for some values of the parameters of the model .",
    "in order to evaluate the @xmath17 decay , there are six free parameters of the thdm which should be addressed .",
    "they are the masses of the four scalar bosons @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , together with the vevs ratio @xmath109 and the mixing angle @xmath38 . without loosing generality , we will assume that @xmath110 .",
    "although the @xmath17 decay width does not depend on @xmath108 , the respective branching ratio does depend on all of these parameters . instead of examining the behavior of @xmath17 for arbitrary values of these parameters and looking for those which enhance its branching ratio , a realistic analysis must take into account the most recent constraints obtained from precision measurements and direct searches at particle colliders .",
    "we will thus concentrate on the region of the parameter space which is still consistent with low - energy data .",
    "the parameter space of thdms as constrained by electroweak precision measurements has been recurrently studied in the literature @xcite . along this line",
    ", it is well known that the experimental bound on the inclusive decay @xmath111 can be translated into a bounded area on the @xmath105-@xmath109 plane .",
    "in addition , the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath18 is useful to constrain the cp - odd scalar boson mass @xmath108 , which along with the cp - even scalar boson masses @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be further constrained by the @xmath112 decay mode @xmath113 .",
    "all these constraints , when combined with those obtained from the @xmath7 parameter and the data from direct searches at the cern @xmath8 lep collider , can yield the allowed region in the parameter space of thdms . quite recently , the most up - to - date measurements on @xmath114 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath113 @xcite , and @xmath7 @xcite , together with the delphi @xcite and opal @xcite excluded regions , were considered to constrain the parameter space of the type - ii thdm @xcite . in particular , the possibility of a very light cp - odd scalar boson was considered in @xcite , whereas a more general treatment was presented in @xcite . from these studies",
    "one is lead to conclude that the parameter space of the thdm has become tightly constrained by the most recent measurement of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "below we will follow closely the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model independent bound @xmath115 gev has been derived at lep for a charged higgs boson decaying solely into @xmath116 @xcite . on the other hand , within the thdm - ii , the latest reported value for the decay @xmath114 @xcite yields the very stringent lower bound @xmath117 gev for intermediate and large values of @xmath118 , though this bound can loosen in susy models with conserved or broken @xmath119-parity @xcite . as far as @xmath18 is concerned ,",
    "the latest experimental data from the bnl collaboration @xcite require a positive contribution from new physics to bring the theoretical value closer to the experimental one .",
    "it turns out that the cp - odd scalar yields a positive contribution to @xmath18 , whereas the remaining higgs bosons give a negative contribution .",
    "this means that the deviation between the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath18 can only be explained by the existence of a light cp - odd scalar along with a high value of @xmath109 and relatively heavy @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "when the @xmath113 constraint @xcite is taken into account , a large region of the parameter space of the thdm gets excluded , and only a tiny region survives when the delphi @xcite and opal @xcite excluded regions for the scalar boson masses are considered . from this analysis , it was concluded @xcite that the most favorable region is that in which @xmath120 is of the order of 50 or larger , @xmath121 gev , @xmath122 gev , and @xmath123 .",
    "even more , the @xmath124 constraint requires fine - tuned solutions for the masses of the scalar bosons and the mixing angles .",
    "in fact , this constraint is satisfied by an almost decoupling cp - even scalar boson @xmath10 , with a mass of the order of 1 tev , provided that the remaining parameters meet the previous constraints .",
    "bearing in mind the preceding discussion , we will analyze the @xmath17 decay for 300 gev @xmath125 600 gev .",
    "for the sake of illustration we will assume that the lightest cp - even scalar boson is relatively light and the heaviest one is much heavier indeed , _",
    "i.e. _ we will take @xmath126 gev and @xmath127 tev .",
    "the former value is consistent with the current lep bound on the mass of a sm - like higgs boson @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will focus on the region where @xmath109 is large and @xmath128 is close to -1 .",

    "[ dectb ] , whereas in fig .",
    "[ decmh ] we show them as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "we can observe that , in this range of parameters , the @xmath17 decay is slightly dominated by the bosonic contribution .",
    "the fermionic contribution is larger only in the region of the parameter space where @xmath128 is very close to -1 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ decsa ] , where we show the partial contributions to the @xmath17 decay as a function of @xmath128 for @xmath131 300 gev and two different values of @xmath109 .",
    "we see that the bosonic contribution is maximal when @xmath132 and minimal when @xmath133 , where it is smaller than the fermionic contribution . for this particular set of the parameters ,",
    "the maximal value of the bosonic contribution is more than one order of magnitude than the respective minimal value .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for larger values of @xmath105 and @xmath109 . also , from fig .",
    "[ dectb ] and fig .",
    "[ decmh ] it is interesting to note that the partial contribution from the bosonic sector exceeds the total contribution in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "this stems from the fact that the interference between the partial contributions is destructive .",
    "while the fermion contribution depends only on @xmath109 for a given @xmath105 , the bosonic contribution depends on four other unknown parameters .",
    "this makes harder the analysis of this decay mode .",
    "partial contributions to the @xmath0 decay width as a function of @xmath134 for @xmath135 gev and two different values of @xmath109 .",
    "the constant lines correspond to the fermion contribution and the remaining to the bosonic one .",
    "the values of the cp - even scalar boson masses are the same as in fig .",
    "[ dectb ] . ]    the full width of the charged scalar boson is given to a good approximation by the sum of the partial widths of the two - body decay channels induced at the tree - level : @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "the widths for all these decays can be readily obtained and we refrain from presenting the respective expressions here . in the region of the parameter space that we are considering , the charged scalar boson would decay mainly into @xmath141 .",
    "this decay mode is somewhat troublesome as it would suffer from large qcd backgrounds at a hadronic collider @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 branching ratio is shown in fig .",
    "[ brtb ] as a function of @xmath109 for @xmath142 gev and two different values of @xmath128 .",

    "the behavior of @xmath143 as a function of @xmath105 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ brmh ] . for @xmath146 ,",
    "the branching fraction decreases very slowly for larger @xmath105 , whereas for @xmath147 it has a minimal around @xmath148 gev and increases slowly until about @xmath149 gev , where there is a maxima .",

    "the same as fig .",
    "[ brmh ] in other region of the parameter space of the thdm - ii . ]",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the @xmath17 branching ratio may be dramatically enhanced , mainly by the fermionic contribution , around the threshold @xmath150 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ brmh-2 ] for some illustrative values of @xmath109 and @xmath128 .",
    "it can be observed that @xmath143 can be larger than @xmath3 when @xmath109 is small regardless of the value of @xmath128 , and up to @xmath3 when a large value of @xmath109 combines with @xmath151 . in the latter case",
    "the bosonic contribution is also responsible for the enhancement .",
    "however , when a large value of @xmath109 combines with @xmath152 , there is large cancellations between the two contributions , which results in a significant suppression of @xmath143 .",
    "unfortunately the region of the parameter space in which such an enhancement shows up is not favored by the constraints from electroweak precision measurements .",
    "although a fourth - fermion family may improve the @xmath17 decay rate @xcite , the enhancement would depend on the splitting between the masses of the fourth - generation quarks @xmath153 , which can not be too large due to the @xmath124 restriction . in this respect , it seems that the @xmath154 decay is more promising since it is sensitive to nondecoupling effects when there is a large splitting between the cp - odd and the charged scalar boson masses @xcite . as discussed above ,",
    "this scenario is still consistent with the constraints on the parameter space of the thdm - ii .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath154 decay can arise at the tree - level in higgs triplet models @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss shortly on the possibility of detecting the @xmath17 decay at future colliders .",
    "single and pair production of heavy charged higgs bosons at both hadronic @xcite and linear @xmath8 colliders @xcite have long received considerable attention .",
    "a charged scalar boson heavier than @xmath155 gev could be detected at a hadronic collider via several processes , such as @xmath156 @xcite , @xmath157 @xcite , and @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "the one - loop processes @xmath159 and @xmath160 give no viable signature at the cern lhc collider @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath156 rate is out of the reach of the fermilab tevatron , it could be detected at the lhc for @xmath105 up to 1 tev @xcite .",
    "this process is appropriate to look for a charged higgs boson in the low- and high-@xmath109 regime .",
    "though the @xmath156 process followed by the decay @xmath161 suffers from irreducible background , the @xmath162 mode is background free due to the distinctive @xmath163 polarization @xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath156 increases for large @xmath109 but falls when @xmath105 increases . at the lhc , the cross section for @xmath164 can be as large as @xmath165 fb for @xmath105 of the order of a few hundreds of gev and @xmath109 around 50 . with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb ,",
    "this rate is enough to detect a charged scalar boson decaying as @xmath166 , but it is not viable to detect the @xmath0 mode unless its decay width is dramatically enhanced .",
    "there is some chance to detect the @xmath17 decay if the constraints on the parameter space can be evaded in some way and the charged scalar boson mass is about 180 gev . in this case",
    "the branching ratio might increase up to @xmath3 , whereas the cross section for @xmath164 can reach the @xmath167 fb level .    in a linear collider ( lc )",
    "the situation is less promising .",
    "if the mass of the charged scalar boson happen to be smaller than half the center - of - mass energy @xmath168 of the lc , it might be detected through the double pair production process @xmath169 @xcite , which has the advantage that it does not depend on @xmath109 as it is dictated entirely by the interactions of the charged higgs boson with the neutral gauge bosons .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath170 , a charged scalar boson might be detected via the single production modes @xmath171 , @xmath172 , or @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "the first two are more promising as arise at the tree level , whereas the last one occurs at one loop . in a linear collider running at @xmath174 gev , the cross section for @xmath171 would be about @xmath175 fb for @xmath135 and @xmath147 gev .",
    "even with an integrated luminosity of @xmath176 @xmath177 , this rate is too small to allow the detection of the @xmath17 decay . if @xmath178 gev , @xmath179 fb for @xmath135 gev , which evidently is also too small for the @xmath17 mode to be detected .",
    "since a lc would also work in the mode @xmath180 , it has been recently proposed to look for a heavy charged scalar boson , with mass larger than half the center - of - mass energy of the lc , through the single production processes @xmath181 and @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "the viability of these modes depends strongly on the strength of the yukawa couplings of the fermions to the charged scalar boson .",
    "it turns out that the rates for these processes can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than for the respective @xmath8 processes @xcite . at a @xmath183 gev linear collider ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath184 is of the order of 1 fb , which is a typical value for intermediate @xmath105 and large @xmath109 .",
    "the detection of @xmath17 would thus not be viable .",
    "of course the charged higgs boson can also be pair produced in the @xmath180 mode provided that the respective center - of - mass energy is enough , but the conclusion remains the same .",
    "a linear collider would thus not be appropriate to look for rare decays of the charged higgs boson .",
    "we have mentioned that while the @xmath17 branching ratio may reach the level of @xmath3 provided that the mass of the charged scalar boson is around the threshold @xmath185 , it is at most of the order of @xmath186 in the region of the parameter space favored by electroweak precision measurements . even if the @xmath17 decay rate was not reduced considerably by the kinematical cuts",
    ", it would be necessary the production of about @xmath187 charged scalar bosons to observe a few events .",
    "this seems to be beyond the reach of the lhc , so the @xmath17 decay would hardly be detected unless its decay width is dramatically enhanced in other model .",
    "a study of the decay @xmath2 was presented in the context of the type - ii thdm .",
    "a nonlinear @xmath1-gauge covariant under the electromagnetic gauge group was used to obtain the one - loop amplitudes .",
    "the advantages of using such a gauge were emphasized . in particular , there are 21 feynman diagrams in the nonlinear @xmath1-gauge , whereas the linear one induces about one hundred .",
    "an analysis of the behavior of the @xmath2 decay width as a function of the parameters of the model was presented , but we focused essentially on the region of the parameter space still allowed by the constraints obtained from the latest reported values of @xmath111 , @xmath113 , @xmath18 and the @xmath7 parameter , which favor a charged scalar boson heavier than the @xmath14 quark , a large value of @xmath109 , and @xmath188 . in this still - allowed region , which was not considered in the previous analyses of the @xmath17 decay , the respective branching ratio receives contribution of the same order of magnitude from both the bosonic and fermionic sectors , and it can be as large as @xmath186 , which seems to be beyond the reach of the lhc .    _ note added : _ after the submission of this manuscript , the muon @xmath5 collaboration announced a new result for the anomalous magnetic moment of the negative muon , which is based on the data collected during the year 2001 @xcite . the new result , @xmath189 , is consistent with previous measurements of the anomaly for the negative and positive muon .",
    "the new world average for the muon anomaly is thus @xmath190 , which is to be contrasted with the previous one @xcite : @xmath191 .",
