    "lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) are exceptional material surfaces that act as cores of observed tracer patterns in fluid flows ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . for oceanic flows ,",
    "the tracers of interest include salinity , temperature , contaminants , nutrients and plankton  quantities that play an important role in the ecosystem and even in climate .",
    "fluxes of these quantities are typically dominated by advective transport over diffusion .",
    "an important component of advective transport in the ocean is governed by mesoscale eddies , i.e. , vortices of @xmath0@xmath1 km in diameter .",
    "while eddies also stir and mix surrounding water masses by their swirling motion , here we focus on eddies that trap and carry fluid in a coherent manner .",
    "eddies of this kind include the agulhas rings of the southern ocean .",
    "they are known to transport massive quantities of warm and salty water from the indian ocean into the atlantic ocean @xcite .",
    "current limitations on computational power prevent that climate models resolve mesoscale eddies in their flow field .",
    "since the effect of mesoscale eddies on the global circulation is significant @xcite , the correct parameterization of eddy transport is crucial for the reliability of these models . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a rising interest in systematic and accurate eddy detection and census in large global data sets , as well as in quantifying the average transport of trapped fluid by all eddies in a given region @xcite .",
    "this quantification requires",
    "( i ) a rigorous method that provides specific coherent eddy boundaries , and ( ii ) a robust numerical implementation of the method on large velocity data sets .",
    "a number of vortex definitions have been proposed in the literature , @xcite , most of which are of eulerian type , i.e. , use information from the instantaneous velocity field .",

    "will generally stretch , fold and filament significantly . yet",
    "only coherently transported scalars resist erosion by diffusion in a way that a sharp signature in the tracer field is maintained .",
    "all this suggests that coherent eddy transport should ideally be analysed via lagrangian methods that take into account the evolution of trajectories in the flow , such as , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "notably , however , none of these methods focuses on the detection of vortices and none provides an algorithm to extract exact eddy boundaries in unsteady velocity fields .",
    "only recently have mathematical approaches emerged for the detection of coherent lagrangian vortices .",

    "all solutions of this variational problem turn out to be closed material curves that stretch uniformly .",
