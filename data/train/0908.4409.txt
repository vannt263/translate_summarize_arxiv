    "historically , string theory is originated as an attempt to provide a theory of strong interactions .",
    "the famous veneziano amplitude is shown to be derivable from the vibrating string which sweeps out a two dimensional world sheet in space time .",
    "the scattering amplitude is calculated from the correlation function on the riemann surface which can be regarded geometrically as punctured riemann surface . two dimensional conformal field theory ( cft )",
    "plays a central role in the development of the string theory .",
    "the most important dynamical principle of this approach @xcite is the associativity of the operator product expansion ( ope ) which in turn leads to the crossing symmetry of the four particle scattering amplitude .",
    "this crossing symmetry is the underlying reason to eliminate the high energy divergences of tree level diagrams . on the other hand ,",
    "modular invariance of the one - loop partition function of conformal cft leads a miraculous way to eliminate high energy divergences of one loop diagrams in string theory .",
    "furthermore , people were trying to understand the strong coupled dynamics of four dimensional quantum field theory from the srong - weak duality ( s dualtiy ) of the quantum field theory itself @xcite . during the past two decades",
    ", we gained a lot of understandings about four dimensional gauge theories from the s dualities @xcite .",
    "s dualities are also related to geometric langlands duality @xcite .",
    "these two seemingly unrelated subjects are put together by gaiotto s observation @xcite on @xmath0 superconformal field theory ( scft)(see recent developments in ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that four dimensional @xmath0 scft can be realized as six dimensional @xmath3 theory compactified on a punctured riemann surface .",
    "the coupling constants are determined by the complex structure of this punctured riemann surface while different s dual frames are determined by various degeneration limits of this surface .",
    "the flavor groups are determined by the puncture types which are labeled by young tableaux .",
    "everything about the gauge theory is encoded into this punctured riemann surface .",
    "recalling our discussion about the conformal field theory , it is natural to wonder if there is any connection between those two subjects .",
    "agt @xcite proposed a remarkable conjecture that for @xmath1 theory the partition function of the gauge theory is equivalent to the correlation function of the liouville theory .",
    "liouville theory falls into the general framework of cft @xcite .",
    "one may wonder why a four dimensional theory can be equivalent to a two dimensional theory .",
    "this might be related to a remarkable property of the liouville theory : the central charge is adjustable .",
    "then the degrees of freedom of liouville theory is rather mysterious and makes a four dimensional correspondence possible .",
    "it is interesting to further explore the correspondence between gauge theory and liouville theory . in this note",
    ", we make the observation that we can determine the transformation law under s - duality of the partition function of @xmath0 gauge theory with four fundamentals from the crossing symmetry of the liouville four point function .",
    "the transformation law for @xmath2 @xmath1 theory under s - duality can be determined similarly from the one - loop partition function of liouville theory .",

    "there are various particles with mass @xmath11 and spin @xmath12 which might be exchanged : @xmath13 we have the following similar amplitude if we consider @xmath9 channel : @xmath14 two remarkable properties of the scattering amplitude are that the above sums are infinite and these two amplitudes are equal to each other @xmath15 . the last property which is called @xmath16 duality motivates the proposed veneziano amplitude .",
    "it is well known that the veneziano amplitude can be derived from two dimensional ( world sheet ) string theory .",
    "the infinite sum is due to the infinite number of states in mass spectrum .",
    "the @xmath16 duality is simply the crossing symmetry of the four point function of conformal field theory .",
    "this crossing symmetry is also equivalent to the associativity of the ope on the world sheet : @xmath17    we briefly summarize some properties of cft .",

    "the correlation functions involving the energy momentum tensor and secondary states are expressed by the correlation functions of the primary states .",
    "the ope of two primary states are given as @xcite : @xmath28 the most important dynamical information are @xmath29 and the conformal dimensions .",
    "the four point function has the form @xmath30 here we fixed the positions of three vertex operators as @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the projective invariant variable . the crossing symmetry is @xmath33 using ope of @xmath34 , the four point function is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the conformal block which is entirely determined by the conformal symmetry(we give the s channel contribution ) .",
    "the crossing symmetry relates the contributions of different channels ( see for instance figure 2 ) :        next let s consider the one - loop partition function defined on a torus : @xmath37 here @xmath38 runs over all the states in cft and @xmath39 is the fermion number , @xmath40 .",
    "it is well known that this partition function is needed to be invariant under the @xmath41 modular group transformation of the torus .",
    "the high energy density states of this theory is determined by the central charge for compact unitary conformal field theory .",
    "for liouville theory , there is a modification to this result , see @xcite .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite that a strongly coupled gauge theory can be described by a weakly coupled theory in which the elementary particles are the monoples of the original theory .",
    "this proposal is naturally realized in @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theory and is extended to a @xmath41 duality group .",
    "later , @xmath42 @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory with four fundamental hypermultiplets has also been shown to have the @xmath41 duality @xcite .",

    "next , let s study the @xmath2 su(2 ) theory .",
    "it is given by the six dimensional @xmath45 theory compactified on a smooth torus .",
    "the @xmath41 duality of the gauge theory is interpreted as the @xmath41 modular invariance of this torus .",
    "the full partition function of this theory is of the same form as formula ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath2 @xmath61 gauge theory the one - loop part is trivial @xmath62 and the full partition function for @xmath61 gauge theory is : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "agt @xcite made a conjecture that the full partition function of the above @xmath0 @xmath1 scft is equivalent to the correlation function of liouville theory .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the instanton part of the gauge theory partition function is equal to the conformal block of the correlation function and the one - loop part and classical part correspond to the structure constant part of the correlation function .",
    "it is also argued that the energy momentum tensor of liouville theory is related to the operator ( [ 5 ] ) ( this can be seen from the classical uniformization problem with the punctured sphere ) .",
    "the relation between the deformation parameters and the parameters in liouville field theory is @xmath66 here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the deformation parameters in nekrasov s instanton partition function .",
    "notice that in order to use the partition function on @xmath51 , we need to set @xmath69 .",
    "we associate a exponential vertex operator @xmath70 to each puncture .",
    "we also associate a intermediate state @xmath71 to weakly coupled @xmath1 group with coulomb parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the exact relations between the parameters in gauge theory and liouville theory are @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the conventional parameter for the liouville theory @xmath74 . see figure 4 for the correspondence .",
    "gauge theory in one particular s dual frame , the coulomb branch parameter is @xmath53 .",
    "one the right hand side , we draw the @xmath9 channel contribution to the four point function of liouville theory.,width=336 ]    now the crossing symmetry ( [ 1 ] ) of cft states that the correlation function of different channels are related . when we consider the gauge theory , the different channels mean different @xmath75 dual frames ( see figure 3 ) . with the identification between the partition function of gauge theory and correlation function of cft , we conclude that :    the partition function of this four dimensional scft in different s dual frames are related as in formula @xmath76 .",
    "notice that the gauge coupling is identified with the position of the unfixed coordinate of the vertex operator , and the second identity in @xmath76 relates theories with gauge couplings @xmath77 .",
    "so this identity implies that the partition function of one strongly coupled theory is determined by another weakly coupled theory as predicted by s - duality !",
    "we have determined the exact relations between them from liouville theory .",
    "next let s consider @xmath2 @xmath1 theory , then we are tempting to identify the gauge theory partition function with the partition function of liouville theory , the liouville partition function can be calculated from ( [ 3 ] ) : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the zero mode contribution and is independent of @xmath80 , this is identified with the gauge theory partition function ; we also need to identify @xmath81 for intermediate state and the gauge coupling is @xmath82 which is consistent with our previous identification . comparing to ( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath83 , we can see that the @xmath84 part contribution to gauge theory partition function is @xmath85 this result can be generalized to @xmath86 case in which the @xmath87 conformal toda field theory is involved .",
    "the one - loop partition function of @xmath87 theory is equivalent to @xmath88 free scalars so the partition function has a factor @xmath89 , comparing with ( [ 4 ] ) , the @xmath84 part contributes a factor @xmath90 .",
    "in this note , we derive the transformation law for the partition function of certain su(2 ) scft under the s duality transformation from liouville theory point of view .",
    "it is easy to generalize to higher rank gauge theory ( for higher rank gauge theory , the cft side is the conformal toda field theory @xcite ) .    consider a six dimensional @xmath3 theory compactified on a punctured riemann surface @xmath91 , we get a four dimensional gauge theory on a four manifold @xmath92 ; on the other hand , we can first compactify six dimensional theory on a four manifold @xmath92 ( with possible singularities ) , we can get a cft on @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting to identify @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the corresponding gauge theory and conformal field theory .",
    "we may also have the beautiful correspondence between gauge theory and cft .",
    "finally , liouville theory plays a fundamental role in non - critical string theory , and it has interesting application to cosmology@xcite .",
    "any understanding of the dynamics of the theory is interesting .",
    "the dynamical information of the theory is encoded in the structure constant of the theory .",
    "this can be calculated from the one - loop part of the partition function .",
