    "<S> mips j142824.0 + 352619  is a bright 160 @xmath1 source with a large infrared - to - optical flux density ratio . </S>",
    "<S> previous authors provide evidence for a foreground lens and estimate an amplification of @xmath410 , although this factor is presently poorly constrained . the 6.2 , 7.7 , 11.3 , and 12.8 @xmath1 pah emission bands in its _ irs_spectrum indicate a redshift of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the large equivalent width of the 6.2 @xmath1 pah feature indicates that at least 50% of the mid - infrared energy is generated in a starburst , an interpretation that is supported by a large [ ] / [ ] ratio and a low upper limit on the x - ray luminosity .    </S>",
    "<S> sst24 j142827.19 + 354127.71  has the brightest 24 @xmath1 flux ( 10.55 mjy ) among optically faint ( @xmath5 ) galaxies in the ndwfs . </S>",
    "<S> its mid - infrared spectrum lacks emission features , but the broad 9.7 @xmath1 silicate absorption band places this source at @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> given this redshift , sst24 j142827.19 + 354127.71  has among the largest rest - frame 5 @xmath1 luminosities known . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of its sed to those of known agn - dominated ulirgs and its lack of either pah features or large amounts of cool dust indicate that the powerful mid - infrared emission is dominated by an active nucleus rather than a starburst .    </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate the power of the _ irs _  in identifying massive galaxies in the well - known `` redshift desert '' between @xmath8 and in discerning their power sources . because they are bright , mips j142824.0 + 352619  ( pending future observations to constrain its lensing amplification ) and sst24 j142827.19 + 354127.71  are useful @xmath9 templates of a high luminosity starburst and agn , respectively . </S>"
