    "the appearance of high - t@xmath7 superconductivity focused everyone s attention on the properties of strongly interacting two - dimensional electron systems .",
    "basically the high - t@xmath7 cuprates are characterized by a doping parameter which regulates the amount of charge concentration in the cuo@xmath8 planes .",
    "as one varies the doping concentration and temperature one finds an antiferromagnetic phase , a pseudo - gap phase , an anomalous metallic phase and a d - wave superconductor .",
    "the standard model to describe these phenomena is the the two - dimensional ( @xmath9 ) hubbard model . starting either from the so - called weak coupling limit or from the large @xmath10 limit instead one can reproduce at least in qualitative terms all these phases by varying only a small number of appropriate parameters@xcite .",
    "in particular , for the underdoped and optimally doped compounds , motivated by the experimental results coming from angle - resolved photoemission experiments @xmath11 which demonstrated among other things the presence of an anisotropic electronic spectra characterized by a pseudogap and flat bands in @xmath12-space several workers have related some of these anomalies to the existence of a non - conventional fermi surface @xmath0 in these materials@xcite .",
    "as is well known for the half - filled @xmath9- hubbard model the @xmath6 being perfectly square the perfect nesting and the presence of van hove singular points allow the mapping of this system onto perpendicular sets of one - dimensional chains@xcite producing infrared divergences in both particle - particle and particle - hole channels , already at one - loop level .",
    "the physical system in this case shows a non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "however as doping is increased the @xmath6 immediately acquires curved sectors and this opens up a possibility for fermi liquid like behavior around certain regions of @xmath12-space .",
    "this feature seemed to be confirmed early on by the arpes data for the underdoped and optimally doped bi2212 and ybco compounds@xcite . in the electronic spectra of these materials",
    "there appears an anisotropic pseudogap and flat bands around @xmath13and @xmath14 and traces of gapless single - particle band dispersions around the @xmath15regions of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "this agrees qualitatively well with the phenomenological picture of a fs composed of hot and cold spots put forwarded by hlubina and rice and pines and co - workers@xcite . in that picture",
    "the cold spots associated with correlated quasiparticle states are located along the bz diagonals .",
    "in contrast the hot spots centered around @xmath13and @xmath14 are related to the pseudogap and other anomalies of the cuprate normal phase .",
    "however recent photoemission experiments@xcite which have a much better resolution than before put into doubt the applicability of fermi liquid theory even along the @xmath16- @xmath17 direction . using their data on momentum widths as a function of temperature for different points of fs , in optimally doped bi2212 , valla et al",
    "show that the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath18 scales linearly with the binding energy along that direction independent of the temperature .",
    "similarly , kaminski et al show that the half - width - half - maximum of the spectral function @xmath19 single particle peak varies linearly with @xmath20 above @xmath21 .",
    "they claim this to be analogous to both the observed linear temperature behavior of the electrical resistivity and the scattering rate .",
    "those results are very different from those expected for a fermi liquid and support a marginal fermi liquid phenomenology even near the @xmath22 points of the brillouin zone .    in this work we consider a a two - dimensional electron gas with a truncated @xmath6 composed of four symmetric patches with both flat and conventionally curve arcs in @xmath12-space .",
    "these patches for simplicity are located around @xmath23and @xmath24 respectively@xmath25 .",
    "the fermi liquid like states are defined around the patch center .",
    "in contrast the border regions are taken to be flat . as a result in this region",
    "the electron dispersion law is one - dimensional@xcite . in this way in each patch there are conventional two - dimensional electronic states sandwiched by single - particles with a flat @xmath6 to simulate the cold and hot spots scenario described earlier on .",
    "flat @xmath6 sectors and single - particle with linear dispersion were also used earlier on by dzyaloshinskii and co - workers@xcite to produce logarithmic singularities and non - fermi liquid behavior . here",
    "they are used to test the stability of the two - dimensional fermi liquid states .",
    "we use the renormalization group @xmath26 method to deal with the infrared @xmath27 singularities produced in perturbation theory by the `` cooper '' , `` exchange '' and `` forward''channels .",
    "other @xmath28 methods were used recently by several workers to test the weak - coupling limit of the two - dimensional hubbard model with and without next - nearest neighbor hopping against superconducting and magnetic ordering instabilities in different doping regimes@xcite .",
    "however due to the difficulty in implementing their method in higher orders they do nt go beyond one - loop and no self - energy effects are taken into account . as a result the coupling functions always have divergent flows and",
    "there is never any sign of non - trivial fixed points .",
    "the scope of this work is the following .",
    "we begin by reviewing briefly the model used in our calculations .",
    "next we calculate the one - particle irreducible functions @xmath29and @xmath30 up to two - loop order .",
    "we demonstrate that the quasiparticle weight @xmath5 for the two - dimensional fermi liquid state can vanish identically as a result of the interaction of the `` cold '' particles with the flat sectors .",
    "we solve the @xmath28 equation for the renormalized coupling in two - loop order and we find a non - trivial ir stable fixed point .",
    "later we estimate how higher - order corrections and the mixing of the various scattering channels affect this result .",
    "we calculate the spin and charge susceptibilities and discuss their physical contents .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that our results indicate the instability of two -dimensional fermi liquid states when they are renormalized by the interaction with the flat sectors of the fermi surface and by arguing that they may well be used to describe qualitatively the pseudogap phase of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "consider a @xmath9 @xmath6 consisting of four disconnected patches centred around @xmath23 and @xmath31 .",
    "let us assume to begin with that they are fermi liquid like .",
    "the disconnected arcs separate occupied and unoccupied single - particle states along the direction perpendicular to the fermi surface .",
    "however as we approach any patch along the arc itself there is no sharp resolution of states in the vicinity of the gaps located in the border regions .",
    "we assume that these regions are proper for non - fermi liquid @xmath32 behavior . to represent those @xmath33 features we take the @xmath6 to be flat in the border regions . in this way",
    "the single - particle states which are a @xmath9 fermi liquid around the center of the patch acquire an one - dimensional dispersion as we approach those flat border sectors .",
    "they represent the ",
    "hot spots sandwiching the cold spots in our model .",
    "in order to be more quantitative consider the single - particle lagrangian density    @xmath34    where @xmath35,@xmath36 , @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the effective mass .",
    "when we proceed with our renormalization scheme in the vicinity of a given @xmath6 point we replace @xmath39 by the corresponding bare @xmath40 where @xmath41 is dimensionless with @xmath42 being a momentum scale . in this way",
    "@xmath41 can be finite even if both @xmath5 and @xmath43 and the coupling constant @xmath10 scales with momenta as @xmath44 in @xmath45 spatial dimensions . here",
    "the fermion fields are non - zero only in a slab of width @xmath46 around the four symmetric patches of @xmath6 .",
    "thus in momentum space the single - particle @xmath47 is defined according to the sector and patch under consideration .",
    "for example , in the vicinity of the central zone of the patch defined around the @xmath6 point @xmath48 we have that    @xmath49    with @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast in the border regions of the same patch we find instead    @xmath51    for @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "we follow the same scheme to define @xmath47 in all other patches of @xmath6 .    in setting up our perturbation theory scheme two quantities appear frequently : the particle - hole and the particle - particle bubble diagrams . in zero - th order",
    "they are defined respectively as    @xmath54    and    @xmath55    where @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58and @xmath59 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath60 is singular only if the @xmath61 s refer to flat sectors such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are points from corresponding antipodal border regions of @xmath6 . in the case ,",
    "in which e.g. @xmath64 we find    @xmath65\\ ] ]    with @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast @xmath67is singular for particles located in both cold and hot spots whenever they are involved in a cooper scattering channel .",
    "here for e.g. @xmath68 we obtain    @xmath69\\ ] ]    as is well known the cooper channel singularity drives the system towards its superconducting instability . however at one - loop for a repulsive interactions the renormalized coupling approaches the trivial fermi liquid fixed point@xcite .",
    "as opposed to that the singularity in @xmath60 produced by the one - loop exchange channel drives the physical system to a non - perturbative regime . this non - perturbative behavior might be indicative of either the failure of the one - loop truncation or of the inadequacy of perturbation theory itself to deal with that situation . to find out what is in fact the case we consider the effect of higher - order contributions in both one - particle irreducible functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "let us initially consider the one - particle irreducible function @xmath72 for a @xmath73 located in the vicinity of a cold spot point of @xmath6 such as @xmath74 .",
    "we can write @xmath1 in this case as    @xmath75    where , using perturbation theory , the two - loop self - energy @xmath76 is given by    @xmath77    the constant term produces at this order a constant shift in @xmath39 which will be neglected from now on . evaluating the integrals over @xmath78 we obtain@xcite    @xmath79    clearly both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are divergent at @xmath6 .",
    "this gives the marginal fermi liquid result @xcite for @xmath82 and @xmath83 which nullifies the quasiparticle weight @xmath84 at the fermi surface .",
    "we can also arrive at this result using the renormalization group @xmath26 .",
    "for this we define the renormalized one - particle irreducible function @xmath85 such that at @xmath86 , where @xmath20 is a small energy scale parameter , and @xmath87 , @xmath88 . using @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath89 is related to the corresponding bare function @xmath90 by    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the corresponding bare coupling . since at zero - th order @xmath93 it follows from our prescription and perturbative result that",
    "@xmath94    naturally , @xmath95 if @xmath96 . as we showed elsewhere this result reflects itself in the anomalous dimension developed by the single - particle green s function at @xmath6",
    ".    let us next calculate the one - particle irreducible two - particle function @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "this function depends on the spin arrangements of the external legs as well as on the scattering channel into consideration .",
    "generically for antiparallel spins up to two - loop order we have that    @xmath99    the only one - loop terms are the particle - hole diagram which couples legs with opposite spins and the particle - particle diagram for legs with opposite spins .",
    "the forward - channel which is associated with diagrams with external legs of the same side with the same spin only begins contributes to @xmath100 from the two - loop order on .",
    "the other two - loop contributions are omitted here for economy of space .",
    "in contrast , if we now consider the two - particle function for parallel spins we find instead    @xmath101    clearly the singularities in our perturbation series expansions depend very crucially on the values of the external momenta . due to this anisotropy of momenta space",
    "different scattering channels produce different divergent results at different positions of @xmath6 .",
    "as we will see later this automatically requires the definition of momenta dependent bare coupling functions in our perturbation series expansions . despite",
    "that all the existing divergences can be grouped together with respect with their scattering channel and vertex type associated with the singular loop integrations .",
    "this opens the way to define a systematic regularization procedure to guide our renormalization group prescriptions throughout all our calculations .",
    "here we follow the convention to define the `` exchange '' type vertex when its left @xmath102 incoming and outgoing lines have opposite spins .",
    "we have an `` exchange '' type divergence whenever the momenta of particles with opposite spins can be tunned together to produce a logarithmic singularity in the one - loop particle - hole diagram .",
    "this can be easily achieved in the `` exchange '' scattering channel for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast for @xmath105 and @xmath106 it is now the particle - particle diagram which gives the leading contribution in one - loop order . when this is the case we say we have a ",
    "cooper  channel .",
    "now the divergent particle - particle loop can be described in terms of bare ",
    "cooper vertices .",
    "finally we say we have bare `` forward '' vertex whenever a particle - hole loop produced by left @xmath102 incoming and outgoing particles with same spins becomes divergent .",
    "this vertices appear naturally in the `` forward '' ( zero sound ) channel for @xmath107 and @xmath108 . here",
    "it is now @xmath109 and @xmath110 which are tunned to produce a @xmath111 divergence in two - loop order . in this work",
    "we consider only the leading divergence at every order of perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless since we go beyond one - loop and we include non - trivial self - energy corrections we take explicitly into account contributions which do nt appear either in parquet type or numerical @xmath28 approaches . inasmuch as both the renormalization conditions and the bare coupling functions vary as we move along in momenta space , strictly speaking , we need an infinite number of counter - terms to regularize our model",
    ". however all the divergences which appear in perturbation theory can be associated with a loop integration with vertices which are either of exchange , cooper or forward type . as we will show explicitly later",
    "it is possible to define three bare coupling functions @xmath112 ,",

    "conventional 2@xmath45 fermi liquid states are sandwiched by single particles with a linear dispersion law to simulate the so - called `` cold '' spots as in the experimentally observed truncated fermi surface of the underdoped normal phase of the high - temperature superconductors .",

    "new experimental data on both optimally doped and underdoped bi2212@xcite above @xmath21 indicate that the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath445 scales linearly with @xmath20 even along the @xmath16-@xmath17direction .",
    "this is consistent with other photoemission experiments@xcite which support a marginal fermi liquid phenomenology over the whole fermi surface .",
    "our results are in general agreement with those experimental findings since the power law corrections we find for this linear behavior can in some cases be so small as not to be detectable by the present day experiments .",

    "the field theory regularization scheme allow us to introduce local counterterms to cancels all divergences order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "this simplifies the problem considerably although due to the anisotropy in @xmath275 space the counterterms are in fact momenta dependent .",
    "the bare coupling constant becomes a bare coupling function and we proceed with the regularization of the divergences grouping them together accordind to their location at @xmath6 , the scattering channel and the vertex type interaction .",
    "we introduce in this way three bare coupling functions @xmath455 , @xmath456 and @xmath457 to systematically cancel all the local divergences in our perturbation theory expansions . in this scheme",
    "the effects produced by the crossing of different channels is practically non - existent up to the two - loop order calculation of the self - energy .",
    "therefore if we only consider the leading divergence at every order of perturbation theory it is essential to proceed with the renormalization of fields in order for the running coupling functions to develop non - trivial infrared @xmath27 stable fixed points . as opposed to the parquet or the wilsonian @xmath28 methods we do nt try to derive an effective action in explicit form",
    "this would in practice demand the introduction of an infinite number of local counterterms in our lasgrangian model . nevertheless all divergences can be removed to all orders by local subtractions around a given point of momentum space .",
    "the anisotropy of the fermi surface therefore reflects itself directly in the momentum dependence of the coupling parameters .",
    "this feature is consistent with the findings of those other two approaches refered before .",
    "however since we take explicit into account self - energy even if we do nt go beyond the leading divergence approximation and we are able to find non - trivial fixed point solutions in our higher loop calculations . with our two - loop results for the non - trivial fixed points together with the assumption that the physical system acquires a critical condition as we approach the fermi surface by taking the scale parameter @xmath96 we can solve the @xmath28 equation for the renormalized single particle propagator @xmath458 in the vicinity of a chosen `` cold '' spot point .",

    ". there could be in this way phase separation in @xmath275 space and there is a complete breakdown of the landau fermi liquid when the `` cold '' spot suffers the effects produced by the flat @xmath6 sectors .",
    "since essentially the @xmath28 exponentiates the self - energy @xmath461 corrections the power law behavior of @xmath183 reflects itself back in the renormalized self - energy given      with @xmath273depending on the size of the size of the flat fermi surface sectors through the fixed point coupling strength . for certain @xmath275space regions near @xmath6",
    "we show that @xmath463 .",

    "two - loop order the corresponding multiplicative renormalization constants @xmath341 and @xmath475 produce cancellation effects in @xmath476 but not in @xmath477 since it continues to have a power law singularity for @xmath478 and @xmath96 .",
    "moreover in this order of perturbation theory we show that the pairing susceptibility @xmath479 is finite at the fixed point for @xmath478 and @xmath96 since @xmath171is non - zero and the cooper singularity is cancelled exactly by the renormalization factor @xmath406 .",
    "this result depends on the location of the interacting particles at the fermi surface and as a result it changes as we move around in @xmath275 space reflecting strong anisotropy effects .",
    "nevertheless this shows that this corresponding non - fermi liquid state is non - superconducting with a finite @xmath473 which could be indicative of charge incompressibility or charge pseudo gap behavior @xcite together with strong spin fluctuations .",
    "as a matter of fact an external parameter @xmath322 must be tuned for the system to approach the critical region and the superconducting transition . using a simple scaling argument we then show that in this case the pairing susceptibility @xmath474 diverges as a power law when @xmath443 in the superconducting critical point .    to conclude it is fair to say that even a simplified anisotropic fermi surface model as the one used in this work is able to produce interesting non - trivial results due to the fact that it contains flat parts which are indicative of a strong interaction regime .",
    "they can turn @xmath9-fermi liquid states into a non - fermi liquid which can be metallic or insulating depending on its location at the fermi surface in @xmath275space .",

    "<S> using perturbation theory and the field theoretical renormalization group approach we consider a two - dimensional anisotropic truncated fermi surface@xmath0 with both flat and curved sectors which approximately simulates the `` cold '' and `` hot '' spots in the cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the one - particle two - loop irreducible functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as the spin , the charge and pairing response functions up to one - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> we find non - trivial infrared stable fixed points and we show that there are important effects produced by the mixing of the existing scattering channels in higher order of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the  cold  spots are turned into a non - fermi liquid with divergents @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a vanishing @xmath5 and either a finite or zero `` fermi velocity '' at @xmath6 when the effects produced by the flat portions are taken into account </S>",
