    "the virial expansion is a classical concept @xcite which has been extended to be applicable for quantum mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "the expansion is in terms of few - body correlations and therefore most efficient when the influence of @xmath0-body effects decrease with @xmath0 . in practice",
    ", this decrease has to be very fast , because higher order correlations are extremely difficult to obtain by accurate calculations .",
    "this fact is not obvious since only the spectrum of @xmath0 interacting particles is needed , not wave functions or structure nor any other properties .",
    "however , obtaining these spectra imply solving the @xmath0-body problem which is already demanding beyond two particles for general interactions .    in the classical textbook by huang on statistical mechanics @xcite ,",
    "the virial expansion is discussed for the quantum mechanical case and it is elegantly demonstrated how the second virial coefficient can be obtained from knowledge of the two - body scattering phase shift and bound state spectrum ( when present ) .",
    "this was subsequently generalized in the seminal paper of dashen , ma , and bernstein @xcite where a formulation of statistical mechanics in terms of the scattering @xmath1-matrix is given .",
    "the formulation gives a prescription for calculating virial coefficients at any order , and shortly thereafter the behavior of the third order coefficient at low temperature was obtained via the @xmath1-matrix method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-matrix approach to virial coefficients is still an actively research topic @xcite with recent applications in the field of cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "however , since determining the @xmath1-matrix in a general system with multiple particles is a high non - trivial task , it is valuable to pursue alternative ways of approaching the virial expansion .",
    "approximations or assumptions are unavoidable at some point .",
    "the traditional strategies have been either to limit the hilbert space allowed for the variational many - body wave functions or to design schematic hamiltonians aiming for specific features .",
    "the latter approach requires great care and physical intuition to retain the necessary features of the hamiltonian that will accurately describe the phenomena under study .",
    "an approach along this second line of reasoning is the use of harmonic hamiltonians where interaction terms are replaced by harmonic oscillators .",
    "this is extremely convenient from a computational point of view as many aspects become analytically addressable for both fermionic and bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "the replacement of one- and two - body terms in the hamiltonian by harmonic forms leaves the problem of determining the parameters of the harmonic hamiltonian according to given criteria . here",
    "one must again take guidance from physical properties and aspects of the system that are crucial for the system under study .",
    "recently , we formulated an approach that explores the @xmath0-body problem in an external parabolic confining potential by fixing the two - body interactions to the properties of an exactly solvable problem in the same geometry @xcite .",
    "the two - body information needed is the energy eigenvalues and structural properties of the wave function such as radial averages .",
    "the example studied in ref .",
    "@xcite was short - range interacting particles in a harmonic trap for which the two - body problem can be exactly solved in the zero - range limit @xcite . within the field of cold atomic gases ,",
    "this solution was subsequently confirmed by different experimental groups @xcite .",
    "the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite has since been used as a starting point in both nuclear and cold atomic gas physics @xcite .",
    "recently , the harmonic approximation with parameters fixed to exact two - body properties have been applied to particles that interact via dipole forces @xcite and shown to accurately reproduce numerical few - body results for moderate - to - strong dipole strengths @xcite .",
    "this harmonic method has also been extended to the thermodynamical regime at finite temperature @xcite , where it has been shown using a path - integral formalism that the canonical partition function for given particle number can be obtained @xcite .",
    "here we consider an alternative approach that uses exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian and subsequent calculation of the relevant degeneracies in the energy spectrum for a given number of particles @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual approximation using the grand partition function where only the average particle number is conserved .",
    "the method applies to both identical bosons and fermions as well as distinguishable particles and combinations of all these possibilities @xcite .",
    "the difficult part is to find the degeneracies of the @xmath0-body spectrum for the specified symmetries required by quantum statistics .",
    "the energies themselves are easily found from the harmonic oscillator solutions .",
    "here we consider the virial expansion within the harmonic hamiltonian approximation for identical fermions .",
    "this paper is a natural extension of ref .",
    "@xcite where the thermodynamics of small to moderate size systems of fermions and bosons was considered by direct computation of the partition function .",
    "this requires a numerically efficient determination of the level degeneracies which is , however , only possible up to moderate particle numbers ( @xmath2 ) even in a harmonic model .",
    "the virial expansion is usually a rapidly converging series and we therefore expect to be able to compute coefficients within the harmonic approach .",
    "however , there are some subtleties with the convergence of the coefficients that must be carefully handled",
    ". therefore we focus almost exclusively on the formal development of the virial expansion within the harmonic approximation .",
    "a motivation for our work is the recent investigation of universal thermodynamics within cold atomic gas experiments @xcite where the virial expansion has been succesfully applied @xcite .",
    "however , the expansion is general and is applicable to other fermionic systems .",
    "while the typical condensed - matter and cold atom fermion systems have two internal ( spin or hyperfine spin ) components , we consider the case of single - component fermions here in order to keep the formalism simple while still retaining the full quantum statistical properties of a fermi system .",
    "multi - component fermionic and bosonic systems will be considered in subsequent studies .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to formulate and explore the harmonic method and the virial expansion to prepare for future applications to systems in both cold atomic gases , nuclear physics , as well as condensed - matter systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; we describe the ingredients of the method in sec .",
    "[ method ] the numerical illustrations follow in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] for the lowest virial coefficients . in sec .  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize and provide an outlook for future directions of interest .",
    "we first present general definitions of the crucial ingredients .",
    "then we apply the formulation to the results of a system of @xmath0 particles described by a coupled set of harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "the approach to the large temperature limit is finally modified to exhibit the behavior corresponding to the correct high energy spectrum .",
    "the classical virial expansion is an expansion of the equation of state of a gas of identical particles , usually in powers of the number density @xmath3 , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath7 is the temperature , and the @xmath8 s are the virial coefficients of the expansion . in the classical expansion , they are related to the intermolecular or interatomic potentials of @xmath9 interacting particles .",
    "the advantage of the expansion is that it reveals deviations from ideal gas behavior by examining just the few - body aspects of the system .",
    "the leading term is then the ordinary ideal gas expression for a non - interacting system .",
    "the second term in the classical expansion in three dimensions is given by the @xmath10-coefficient @xmath11d^3r , \\label{e33}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the inter - particle potential depending on the relative coordinate @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "is known as a configuration integral , and from it one can see that this coefficient only converges for potentials which decay faster than @xmath15 .",
    "the convergence in two dimensions is correspondingly only achieved when @xmath16 decays faster than @xmath17 .",
    "the general coefficient is @xmath18 where @xmath16 is the volume of the system .",
    "the i - cluster integrals are all the independent clusters containing the i - particles , first presented graphically by @xcite .",
    "a cluster in this context can be visualized graphically by thinking of @xmath9 numbered circles with lines connecting them symbolizing the interaction between those particles .",
    "these lines can be drawn in many different ways , the only requirement for the @xmath9-cluster is that all @xmath9 atoms or molecules must be connected to at least one other member of the system .",
    "the quantum mechanical version of the cluster expansion was developed at around the same time by @xcite .    for a system of quantum mechanical particles with fermi or bose statistics ,",
    "the expansion is most commonly performed in the fugacity , @xmath19 , of the system , where @xmath20 is the chemical potential of the @xmath0-body system .",
    "the grand canonical partition function , @xmath21 , is written as an expansion in @xmath22 @xmath23 which translates into an expansion for the grand thermodynamic potential , @xmath24 : @xmath25 . \\label{e41}\\ ] ] the first virial coefficients can explicitly be written : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the canonical partition function for @xmath0 particles of the proper symmetry , that is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the degeneracy and energy of the @xmath31th state of the @xmath0-body system .",
    "thus @xmath32 can be calculated solely from the energy spectrum of the @xmath0-body system , and all thermodynamic quantities can then be obtained from @xmath24 in eq .   to the order desired .",
    "the classical virial expansion , eq .  , can be recovered from the quantum version introduced above by using @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite where the relation of @xmath8 and @xmath35 is also discussed ) .",
    "in the present case we have an external trap and the volume must be suitable translated into parameters of the trap before making detailed comparisons to experiments or other studies @xcite .    in practical calculations ,",
    "it is more convenient to consider the difference between interacting and non - interacting systems .",
    "we then consider the differences @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where the superscript ( 1 ) denotes a non - interacting system having the same @xmath0-body fugacity @xmath22 .",
    "we can then re - write eq .   as @xmath38 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the grand thermodynamic potential of the non - interaction system with the same fugacity .",

    "- become @xmath40    these definitions and expressions are general and now applicable to a specified set of potentials producing the partition functions @xmath41 and the corresponding ( differences of ) virial coefficients .",
    "the one- and two - body interactions for the @xmath0-body system are approximated by second order polynomials in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the hamiltonian is a sum of similar terms from each spatial dimension , @xmath42 . in the present work we consider the two- and three - dimensional cases . for identical particles of mass @xmath43",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath44-direction is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the coordinate of particle @xmath9 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are frequencies of the one and two - body interactions , and @xmath49 is a constant adjusting the energy to the desired value .",
    "the factor 1/8 in the second term comes from the use of the reduced mass equal to @xmath50 and to avoid double counting in the sum .",
    "the frequencies and the constant shift can be chosen to reproduce certain properties of a modeled system as discussed in @xcite .",
    "how these parameters are chosen does not affect the computation of the virial coefficients which therefore are obtained as functions of the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "the method is general and applicable as soon as a hamiltonian of the oscillator form is available .",
    "it is , however , still useful to illustrate by describing the procedure for a specific system .",
    "we focus on a system of identical , spin - polarized fermions confined in an external trap @xcite where the fermions interact via a short - range potential . due to the pauli principle",
    ", the particles can not interact in the spherical @xmath51-wave channel , and the lowest non - trivial interaction will be odd and of the @xmath5-wave kind ( higher odd partial wave channels will be neglected ) . in the zero - range limit , the model of busch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can still be solved for @xmath5-wave interactions in both three- @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite traps .",
    "we adjust the interacting frequency , @xmath52 , to reproduce some property related to the spatial extension of the correct two - body wave function ( the average square radius in the two - body ground state in the trap ) .",
    "the shift , @xmath49 , is then added to make sure that the exact two - body ground state energy is reproduced by the oscillator potential . notice that this ( constant ) energy shift does not influence thermodynamics in any essential way .",
    "we therefore ignore it for most of our discussion except for some comments near the end of sec .",
    "[ numerics ] .",
    "the accuracy of the harmonic approximation should depend on the degree to which the physical two - body potential allows a quadratic expansion .",
    "naively , this should be the case for potentials that have a sizable attractive pocket , which is true for many molecular potentials that allow a large number of bound states @xcite .",
    "an example is the morse potential which has been explored in the harmonic approximation in ref .  @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , for dipolar particles ,",
    "the harmonic approximation is extremely accurate , even in the regime of small dipole moments when suitable adjustment of the harmonic frequency is performed @xcite .",
    "in fact , even when the real potential is shallow , the energy can be reproduced to a few percent accuracy with a careful choice of gaussian wave function as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for typical cold atomic gas setups ,",
    "one has harmonically trapped atoms interacting via short - ranged interactions . in the idealized limit of zero - range interactions ,",
    "the two - body problem is exactly solvable as demonstrated by busch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exact solution was used to fit the oscillator parameters that provide the input for the harmonic approximation . in the strongly - bound limit where a deep two - body bound",
    "state occurs , this choice of parameters leads to the same scaling of the energy with particle number that is observed in variational approaches @xcite .",
    "also , when the interactions have a diverging two - body scattering length ( the unitarity limit ) , the two - body wave function becomes similar to the non - interacting wave function in the trap @xcite and we therefore expect the harmonic approximation to be very good .",
    "these features are clearly seen in the one - dimensional case as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one- and three - dimensional cases are very similar .",
    "the scalings away from these limiting cases are similar but not identical to other approaches . in general",
    ", we expect the harmonic approximation to give good qualitative results for strong interactions , but do not expect perfect quantitative agreement with variation or numerics . on the quantitative side , we note that for one - dimensional systems , the three - body energy can be reproduced to within 10 percent in the strongly - bound limit @xcite .",
    "we thus estimate similar accuracy on the third virial coefficient . at this point",
    "we leave the question of how to adjust the two - body parameters of the hamiltonian and proceed with a general discussion for arbitrary parameters .    the solution to eq .",
    "is found by a coordinate transformation which splits the hamiltonian into @xmath0 independent harmonic oscillators with new coordinates and frequencies related to the normal modes of the @xmath0-body system .",
    "for @xmath0 identical particles two new normal mode frequencies are produced , that is the external trap frequency , @xmath53 , corresponding to the center of mass motion , and the @xmath54 times degenerate frequency , @xmath55 , given by @xmath56 the degenerate frequencies correspond to different types of intrinsic ( relative ) motion which for two particles is simply oscillations in the relative coordinate , but in the general case correspond to different normal modes of the system .",
    "the @xmath0-body energy spectrum is @xmath57 where @xmath31 is the index of the @xmath0-body states .",
    "@xmath58 is the number of excitation quanta in the center - of - mass degree of freedom in the @xmath9th direction , while @xmath59 is the number of quanta in the @xmath60th of the @xmath54 degenerate @xmath55 modes in the @xmath9th direction . the energy state @xmath31 is thus given by specifying the number of excitation quanta in each normal mode for all dimensions .",
    "here we have divided into center of mass and relative contributions since in the equal mass case studied here these can be separated completely .      the partition function for one particle , @xmath61 , is the trivial problem of one particle in an external harmonic trap of @xmath62 dimension .",
    "since it has no other particles to interact with , the spectrum arises only from center of mass motion for one particle .",
    "the partition function is in this case found from eqs .   and to be @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",

    "the center of mass piece is completely symmetric in all the coordinates , so it plays no role in determining the overall symmetry of the system .",
    "it is just a geometric series in @xmath62 dimensions , and in fact equal to @xmath61 , since the frequency is that of the external trap .",
    "the relative motion corresponds to the difference between the two individual coordinates . for fermions",
    "this motion then must provide the antisymmetry of the wave function corresponding to an odd number of relative oscillator quanta , @xmath66 , in eq .  .",
    "the energies are completely specified by the quanta and the related degeneracy is easily counted for the relative motion of two particles . to obtain an analytical , closed solution ,",

    "lead to the other factors amounting in total to @xmath77 where the summation over all states is reduced to run over all integers .",
    "the difficulty is then only to know the corresponding degeneracy , @xmath78 .",
    "this number of states of a given excitation energy is found by the method described in @xcite .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "is formally the same in two and three dimensions but the degeneracy factors differ substantially .",
    "the infinite sum must in practice be truncated at some level of excitation .",
    "ideally this is after convergence is reached .",
    "however , this depends strongly on the value of the temperature and we therefore first must decide how large @xmath7-values we need to investigate .",
    "the differences between interacting and non - interacting virial coefficients are found from eqs .   and .",
    "the non - interacting partition functions are structurally the same as the interacting ones , only with @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . using the expressions in eqs .  , , and",

    "of course re - write @xmath83 in terms of the expression for @xmath76 in eq .  ,",
    "but due to the lack of closed form it does not provide any further information .",
    "notice that the low - temperature limit of the virial coefficients above is determined by the value of the shift , @xmath85 . from eq .",
    "we see that @xmath82 will vanish for @xmath86 whenever we have @xmath87 , similarly for the higher virial coefficients . in the following",
    "we will mostly discuss the case @xmath88 , i.e. no shift at all , since this is the relevant case for thermodynamics .",
    "for generality , we comment briefly on the influence of the shift for all temperatures in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] .      at high temperature",
    ", the interacting system should approach a non - interacting system as the kinetic energy dominates the potential .",
    "this does not imply that all @xmath89 must vanish at large @xmath7 , since deviations in the low - energy spectrum between interacting and non - interacting systems easily produce different large - temperature contributions .",
    "this can be seen by dividing the sum over states in the partition functions in low- and high - energy parts .",
    "even if we assume that the high - energy interacting and non - interacting spectra become equal and would thus not contribute to @xmath89 , the low - energy parts remains different and this yields a contribution to the virial coefficient for all temperatures .",
    "however , such difference must remain finite since it arises from a finite energy interval .    as stated before",
    ", the virial expansion does not work for potentials that do not vanish at a fast enough rate , so one would think that the harmonic potential , which does not vanish at all , would cause problems .",
    "indeed , if we use the derived expressions all our @xmath90 diverge with increasing temperature .",
    "the origin of this problem is simply that the energy spectrum is obtained for the @xmath0-body solution of a temperature independent hamiltonian adjusted to reproduce ground state properties .",
    "this does not account for the influence of temperature on the effective interactions and , in turn , on the energy spectrum .",
    "this may also be expressed in terms of an excitation energy dependence of the effective interaction as seen for example in the variation of the mean - free - path . since excitation energy on average",
    "can be related to temperature these formulations are equivalent .",
    "to pin - point the problem and subsequently cure it we start with @xmath82 . in the limit of high temperature , eq .   can be expanded to leading orders in @xmath7 to give @xmath91 equivalently we find for three dimensions that @xmath92 obviously @xmath82 diverges as @xmath7 to the power of the dimension @xmath62 , unless of course interacting and non - interacting frequencies are precisely equal .",
    "the next orders are independent of @xmath7 or vanishing with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the unphysical divergence is here clearly seen to originate from the difference between the energy spacing found by a fit to ground state properties and the spacing for a non - interacting system .",
    "the proper thermodynamics requires a correct spectrum for all energies or temperatures .    in order for @xmath82 to be finite at large temperatures",

    "the simplest such functions @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a cut - off parameter which indicates at what temperature the spectrum continuously should shift to the non - interacting spectrum .",
    "these functions regularize the high temperature behavior and now @xmath82 approaches a constant at high temperatures .",
    "the limits in the different dimensions can be found from eqs .   and by use of eqs .   and",
    ", that is @xmath102 for two dimensions and for three dimensions we get @xmath103 where @xmath104 for this second virial coefficient .",
    "the high temperature limit is then determined by the interaction frequency , ground state energy shift , and the cut - off temperature .",
    "the two terms have opposite sign since @xmath96 is negative , and initially introduced to balance the zero - point energy of the oscillator such that large @xmath48 is correlated with a large negative @xmath96 .",
    "once the @xmath82 is regularized we turn to @xmath105 which is more complex as seen in eq .  .",
    "it consists of two terms , the difference between interacting and non - interacting partition functions for three particles and @xmath106 .",
    "this latter term contains the already regularized factor , @xmath82 , but @xmath61 in eq",
    ".   also diverges as @xmath107 at high temperature .",
    "therefore @xmath105 can only remain finite in the limit when the difference @xmath108 diverges precisely as @xmath61 .    however , this is not even sufficient because the @xmath109 divergence from @xmath61 leads to divergence of the terms in @xmath82 vanishing as @xmath110 in two dimensions and as @xmath110 and @xmath111 in three dimensions .",
    "these terms all must be cancelled by corresponding diverging terms in @xmath108 .",
    "these conditions seems impossible to meet , but nevertheless this miracle seems to occur .",
    "we find that @xmath105 also is regularized with precisely the same cut - off function as used for @xmath82 and this occurs in both two and three dimensions .",
    "problems with divergences in @xmath105 have been reported by other authors @xcite .",
    "they resolved it by separating the system into a 2 + 1 subsystem in which the divergence was then removed .",
    "while we do not need to do this to obtain a finite @xmath112 , the underlying deep reason for this is still unclear to us .",
    "the form of the cut - off in eq .   can be changed in many ways .",
    "the transition can set in at different temperatures and be more or less fast .",
    "we have chosen to use only one parameter , @xmath101 , but we tested with another functional form : @xmath113 which has the same high temperature behavior . both @xmath82 and @xmath105 are again regularized in the large - temperature limit .",
    "the values of @xmath82 and @xmath105 are both larger in magnitude at all temperatures simply because this cut - off function is larger for all @xmath7 .    instead of the temperature cutoff in eq .",
    ", we could choose a cutoff in excitation energy .",
    "this might at first appeal as being more physically reasonable since this directly amounts to changing the @xmath0-body spectrum at high excitation energy to the non - interacting @xmath0-body spectrum .",
    "however , this conclusion is rather shaky .",
    "completely different configurations specified by sets of quantum numbers can give precisely the same energy .",
    "this is easily seen in a single particle picture by comparing ( i ) states of the same total energy arising from a few particles at very high - lying levels and all others in the lowest possible levels with ( ii ) the opposite where all particles are in levels of intermediate energy .",
    "thus , a given excitation energy already corresponds to an average over many configurations very similar to the configurations occupied for a given temperature . in any case we investigated a cutoff in excitation energy instead of temperature , that is expressions of similar simplicity as those in eq .  :",
    "@xmath114 where @xmath115 is the excitation energy .",
    "this function is inserted in eq .   in the place of @xmath94 , and when the partition function is being calculated as the sum over states , the step in energy taken between states is now dependent on the position in the spectrum .",
    "the mean field spacing is reached for energies higher than @xmath116 . implementing this cutoff",
    "successfully regularizes @xmath93 , but to remove the divergence for @xmath105 , it is necessary to use a constant , @xmath116 , different from that of @xmath82 . no obvious relation is found and generalizations to higher @xmath89 seems to be at least very impractical .",
    "the virial coefficients can now be calculated numerically . in the model",
    "they are completely determined from trap frequency @xmath53 , interaction frequency @xmath48 , shift energy @xmath96 , and cut - off function and related parameters @xmath101 .",
    "we use the trap frequency as energy unit which implies that results for any other value of @xmath53 can be obtained by scaling all energies @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath96 by @xmath119 .",

    "it does appear , however , that for any temperature the behavior of the coefficients is faster than linear .",
    "the apparent lack of saturation for @xmath105 at high temperatures is a very unsatisfactory feature .",

    "the virial coefficients using the exponential cutoff are larger for all temperatures before finally merging into the same high temperature limit .",
    "this is due to the larger cut - off function at all temperatures which leaves the reduction to take place somehwat faster at larger temperatures although the same final saturation is reached for @xmath7 much larger than @xmath101 .",

    "the energies enter in the partition function in the exponent .",
    "contributions disappear from energies much higher than the temperature",

    "this is seen at very low @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ f206 ] where a narrow and large peak is present in both virial coefficients .",
    "the numerical reason is obvious since the negative shift divided by a small temperature produce a very large value .",
    "this occurs for temperatures much smaller than @xmath53 and much before the statistical treatment is meaningful .",
    "the negative shift is not necessarily sufficient for a divergence at low temperatures .",

    "the parameters in fig .",
    "[ f206 ] provide a shift large enough in magnitude to give a spike towards large positive values at very low temperatures .",
    "this changes the sign of @xmath93 , as the term containing the shift eventually ( small @xmath7 ) becomes larger than the non - interacting term in eq .  .    for @xmath105 ,",
    "the singularity at zero temperature comes at a slightly higher temperature since the shift energy is three times larger than for two particles .",

    "the method is , however , as applicable in three dimensions where the coefficients look qualitatively similar to those in two dimensions , see fig .",
    "we notice the increase from zero at @xmath132 , then a decreasing derivative resulting in saturation or in a tendency towards saturation , and finally the divergence at large temperature for @xmath105 due to mismatch between the numerical @xmath76 and the analytical @xmath61 .",
    "the results are more sensitive to the cutoff parameter because higher powers enter in two than in three dimensions , as seen for example by comparing eqs .   and . indeed ,",
    "if one uses @xmath153 , then the magnitude of the coefficients is quite small , of order @xmath154 .",
    "also , the truncation effect in @xmath105 is more sensitive to the cutoff parameter and can begin at comparatively low temperatures when compared to 2d , see fig .",
    "[ f190 ] .",
    "the virial expansion is most efficient when the size of the coefficients decrease with the order .",
    "therefore , a requirement of @xmath155 , leads to a condition on the maximum size of @xmath101 .",
    "this demand is more restrictive for three than for two dimensions .",
    "we have discussed the virial expansion technique and a quantum mechanical formulation is sketched from an analogous classical expansion .",
    "we apply the formulated method to a harmonic approximation to the @xmath0-body problem for identical fermions .",
    "a key step in this approach is the adjustment of the harmonic one- and two - body parameters to pertinent properties of the corresponding two - body problem that holds information about the exact interaction which is approximated by a harmonic form . once these are obtained , the resulting @xmath0-body schrdinger equation may be solved exactly and the spectrum can be used to compute the partition function .",
    "the second and third order virial expansion coefficients are obtained by direct calculation of the two and three - body partition functions .",
    "here we are interested in the details of the formal development of a virial expansion and we therefore vary the parameters of the harmonic interaction terms freely to study the behavior .",
    "the mapping to realistic two - body properties is straightforward .",
    "the virial expansion can be reformulated in terms of deviations between non - interacting and interacting systems .",
    "importantly , the virial coefficients have an unphysical divergence for large temperatures .",
    "it arises in the formulation because the increasing temperature populates higher and higher excited states .",
    "their average properties can be very far from the ground state properties , and eventually the results should resemble those of the non - interacting system where the kinetic energy is decisive .",
    "this is achieved by modifying the energy spectrum by a function of temperature smoothly connecting the low - temperature ground state dominated and high - temperature non - interacting spectra .    to achieve the goal of removing the divergence",
    ", the modification function must reduce the initial interaction frequency to zero by a large - temperature behavior where the power of the temperature is equal to the spatial dimension of the system .",
    "the divergence is removed from the second order expansion coefficient and it turns out that the same modification function removes the divergence from the third order term .",
    "this result is highly non - trivial since the third order divergence is of a very different origin from that of second order .",
    "this is emphasized by an attempt to use an energy ( in contrast to temperature ) dependent modification function which removes the second order divergence but requires an additional adjustment to remove the third order divergence .",
    "the temperature modification is then the more promising approach for applications where higher orders have to be calculated .",
    "we find that the critical temperature value describing where the adjustment of the spectrum should take place and the rate of the modification should be about @xmath156 smaller than the two - body interaction frequency .",
    "this is an analogy to the smearing of shell effects by temperature in an @xmath0-body finite system described by its single - particle spectrum .",
    "this function is exponential and the rate is precisely the single - particle frequency divided by @xmath156 . in our case",
    "the modification function is chosen to have a rate of change of the @xmath0-body energy spectrum which is a rational function of temperature to a power that depends on dimension .",
    "however , the modification takes place on the energies appearing in the exponent of the partition function .",
    "the precise shape of the temperature modification function is not essential for the overall properties unless one consideres extreme cases .",
    "a sensible choice of modification function that regularizes the divergence will thus yield a formalism that can be adjusted to low - energy properties and make further predictions for the many - body problem .",
    "while we have focused on two- and three - dimensional systems in the current presentation , a good testing ground for the formalism discussed would be some of the exactly solvable models that are known in one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "a good example is the @xmath0-boson problem with zero - range interactions studied by lieb , linniger , and macguire @xcite for which the harmonic approximation can be applied @xcite , or to dipolar molecules in one - dimensional setups where @xmath0-body clusterized bound states can easily form @xcite . in the strong - coupling domain",
    "these should be well - described within a harmonic approximation approach .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the harmonic approximation employed at the hamiltonian level gives a divergent set of virial expansion coefficients that must be regularized at high temperature .",
    "this can be done by a careful choice of temperature - dependent spectral modification that will render the virial coefficients finite at all temperatures .",
    "the ease of solving the harmonic @xmath0-body problem and subsequently calculating the virial coefficients makes this an attractive approach to compute many - body properties .",
