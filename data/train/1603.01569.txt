    "i found that even in the absence of an explicit time variable , one could extract a notion of time from structures of the wavefunction itself .",
    "i called such structures records .",
    "the most interesting property of a configuration holding a record is that its born probability becomes a conditional probability , conditional on the configuration representing the record .",
    "it is as if that record really happened , even in a timeless universe .    in @xcite",
    ", i used the structures introduced in @xcite to discuss a dynamical origin for locality .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to disentangle locality from theories that possess gauge degrees of freedom , and general relativity has an honorable tradition in this respect @xcite .",
    "i proposed criteria that would determine locality of subsystems from properties of solution curves in configuration space .",
    "however , the mechanisms discussed in @xcite were not viable for theories that possessed refoliation invariance , such as adm gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , i used tools that required the action of the theory to be of jacobi - type , i.e. expressible as a distance functional in configuration space .",
    "i did not provide an example of a theory that would satisfy all of those criteria in either paper .    here",
    "i close this gap , by providing a theory that satisfies the following conditions : * i * ) it is completely spatially relational .",
    "this in turn is shown to require for a gravitational theory ( in metric variables ) * ii * ) conformal diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "the simplest form of the theory has exactly the interpretation of * iii * ) being of jacobi type , a theory about geodesics in conformal superspace  the physical quotient space ( configuration space quotiented by the symmetries ) .",
    "lastly , one can use the structure of conformal superspace to establish a unique preferred orbit .",
    "this is , in a very precise sense , the most homogeneous of all configurations , and it serves to establish * iv * ) a preferred initial point in the path integral kernel , @xmath7 .",
    "i will furthermore employ a principal fiber bundle view of the theory .",
    "the path integral is then a summation over all paths in the physical quotient space ( configuration space quotiented by the symmetries ) .",
    "the interesting thing about this formulation is that we do nt have to provide a section of the bundle , as is usually done .",
    "i.e. we , do nt have to provide a unique representative for each orbit .",
    "we only have to provide a unique _ path _ in configuration space for each path in the physical quotient space .",
    "this allows us to introduce a different type of gauge - fixing , corresponding to a unique way of lifting the curves from physical space to configuration space .",
    "this novel type of gauge - fixing for gravitational theories without refoliation invariance will then allow me to write a nice local form for the gauge - fixed path integral , with on - shell brst invariance .",

    "for the non - relativistic gravitational systems in consideration here , i will take configuration space to be the space riem@xmath10 , of positive - definite sections of the symmetric covariant tensor bundle @xmath11 over @xmath8 , which forms a subspace ( a cone ) of the banach vector space @xmath12 .",
    "this subspace has a one - parameter family of natural riemannian structures , induced pointwise by the metric @xmath13 : [ equ : supermetric ] ( v , w)_g:=d^3 x g_^abcdv_abw_cd where @xmath14 ( when acting on symmetric tensor fields , @xmath15 and so on ) , and @xmath16 .",

    "the orbits of the spatial diffeomorphisms in @xmath24 are along killing directions wrt to the metric .",
    "if one takes configuration space to be fundamental , one must consider symmetries that act intrinsically on it .",
    "here , i will argue that the most general such symmetries are conformal diffeomorphism transformations .    to find them , we first look at the hamiltonian vector field associated to a smeared functional @xmath25 $ ] , polynomial in its variables . for the associated symmetry to have an action on configuration space that is independent of the momenta ,",

    "let us for now assume that @xmath27 is covariant tensor of rank two .",
    "this possibly requires integrating away covariant derivatives from @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 has no derivatives of the metric , it will straightforwardly commute .",
    "but with no derivatives the only objects we can form are : @xmath30 in the first case , these are just conformal transformations , in the second , they would imply that @xmath31 , a constraint killing any possibility of dynamics .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a tensor with two or more derivatives of the metric .",
    "for example , @xmath32 the algebra of equation does not close for any values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "if one instead chose a term of the form @xmath35 one can show that the rank of this constraint is not constant along phase space , and it would imply that @xmath31 almost everywhere , as before .",
    "the conjecture is that these conclusions hold order by order in number of derivatives of the metric .",
    "similarly , one can show that taking to contain covariant derivatives of @xmath36 , with terms for example of the form @xmath37 , only the momentum constraint , generator of diffeomorphisms , @xmath38 survives as the generators of a closed algebra @xcite",
    ". can also survive .",
    "this is the conformal laplacian in 3-dimensions acting on the trace of the momentum ( which is a conformally invariant scalar density ) . by exploring conformal transformations",
    "one can show that this reduces to the conformal constraint @xmath39 almost everywhere on phase space as well @xcite . ]",
    "thus , i will take gauge symmetries in riem@xmath10 to be conformal diffeomorphism transformations .      to calculate the possible form of the lagrangian for this theory ,",
    "we perform the following calculation .    to start the calculation , we note that if the 3-metric @xmath13 has conformal weight @xmath40 , i.e.@xmath41 , the symmetric 2-tensor @xmath42 , also has conformal weight @xmath40 , and the undensitized totally anti - symmetric 3-tensor @xmath43 has conformal weight @xmath44 .",
    "thus , as a necessary condition to have a conformal diffeomorphism invariant action , we must match the following tensor indices and conformal weights : @xmath45 it turns out that the only polynomial invariant we can form with three derivatives of the metric is the chern - simons functional @xcite , [ equ : cs]cs[g]= d^ 3 x ( d+^ 3 ) where @xmath46 is the levi - civita connection one form associated to @xmath13 .    since @xmath47 $ ] is a conformal diffeomorphism invariant , from functionally differentiating it , we obtain the symmetric tensor : @xmath48}}{\\delta g_{ab}}=\\sqrt{g}c^ { ab}\\ ] ] where the ( undensitized ) cotton tensor is defined as : [ equ : cotton_tensor ] c^ab:=^acd_c(r^b_d-^b_d r ) where here we are using the undensitized totally anti - symmetric pseudo - tensor @xmath43 .",
    "since it is a functional derivative of a conformal diffeomorhism invariant functional , under an infinitesimal diffeomorhism @xmath49 , or infinitesimal conformal transformation , @xmath50 , it must remain invariant .",
    "thus besides being symmetric , we obtain equations telling us that the cotton tensor is also transverse and traceless : [ equ : cotton_tensor_props ] c^ab = c^(ab )  ,   c^ab_;b=0  ,  c^a_a=0    thus , under a conformal transformation @xmath51 @xmath52= \\frac{\\delta{cs[e^ { 4\\rho } g]}}{\\delta ( e^{4\\rho}g_{ab})}=e^{-4\\rho } \\frac{\\delta{cs[g]}}{\\delta g_{ab}}=e^{-4\\rho}\\sqrt{g}c^ { ab}[g]\\ ] ] we get @xmath53 .",
    "the cotton is the unique tensor which transforms covariantly under conformal diffeomorphism in 3-dimensions , and its determination completely specifies the conformal geometry of a metric . with it , we can form scalars by contraction , @xmath54 transforming as @xmath55 , since we need to use @xmath56 metrics to contract all the tensors .",
    "since this is a scalar , we can take the @xmath56-th roots , so that we match the conformal factor of @xmath57 to make a conformal invariant density . for @xmath58",

    "but we need to find a linearized version of the theory if we would like to obtain a linearized wave equation , as in general relativity .",
    "it is encouraging that the yang - mills form of the hamiltonian for ( lie - algebra valued ) one - forms emerges very naturally , from the requirements of conformal covariance and conformal weight matching , in .",
    "for scalar fields , we are required to have the different number of spatial and time derivatives , @xmath236 as in .",
    "in fact , much like minimal coupling and covariance in gr , the requirements of conformal diffeomorphism invariance almost uniquely determine the couplings of matter fields to the metric degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , to truly determine what types of matter are allowed , and how they should be included in the lagrangian requires a deeper effective field theory study , with running of couplings , etc .",
    "nonetheless , the distinct extra coupling of all matter fields and gravitons to the geometry through multiplication by powers of @xmath95 can give an extra , dynamical hierarchy to the different interactions .",
    "it seems that all of our couplings to the gravitational sector have to be in some sense non - minimal , meaning that different regimes of gravity can suppress or amplify different types of interactions ..    [ [ lorentz - symmetry ] ] lorentz symmetry + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    first , we should remark that it is not because the theory does not appear to be general relativity  since it has an anisotropic number of spatial and time derivatives  that it can not match it phenomenologically .",
    "the time appearing in the equations of motion is merely the path parameter in configuration space , and might have little to do with actual experienced duration .",
    "heuristically , it seems natural that if duration is given by a unit of spatial change , then variations in this duration time and in space need to be matched .",
    "i.e. we should have the same number of experienced time derivatives and spatial derivatives .",
    "also , if the equations of motion of matter have the same type of anisotropy than the space - time ones , then even naively there might be no actual way of experiencing lorentz invariance for local matter interactions .",
    "the important question at this level of enquiry is that of the existence of a universal light - cone , or at least one up to current experimental bounds .",
    "suppose we calculate the equations of motion and obtain some evolution equation in @xmath104 for disturbances in the fields .",
    "then if we measure time by the frequency of these waves , and length by their wavelength , the question is whether the resulting velocities are independent of which frequency the waves have . in simpler terms , we need to verify if a propagation of a disturbance at one energy can overtake that of another .",
    "this question boils down to the governing equation being of hyperbolic character . for the yang - mills type interaction",
    "we definitely will obtain such hyperbolic equations , which already accounts for most of our experience with universal light cones ( and which will dominate in the gravitationally adiabatic background ) .",
    "but that is not the case for the scalar interactions we proposed , which naively would give elliptic equations . for gravity , it is at this juncture not yet possible to tell , for we need a detailed study of its equations of motion , which are complicated , and we need to choose a background suitable for this investigation , for example , the one in . in any case ,",
    "experimental bounds for a universal gravitational light cone do nt seem to be that strict experimentally , as far as i am aware .    for a detailed study of the phenomenological comparison with gr we should reconstruct an experienced space - time .",
    "however , since there is no lapse in this theory , we must first extract a notion of duration from a measure of the conformal change of geometry .",
    "that is , calculate how weakly back - reacting matter fields would experience the change the fields .",
    "this is not so far fetched as it might at first seem  a simple technique was developed and used in shape dynamics by koslowski in @xcite yielding the correct results to phenomenologically match gr .    in sum",
    ", the absence of explicit lorentz symmetry needs to be carefully scrutinized phenomenologically .",
    "this research was supported by perimeter institute for theoretical physics .",
    "research at perimeter institute is supported by the government of canada through industry canada and by the province of ontario through the ministry of research and innovation .",
    "it is useful to make a small diversion towards a more geometric explanation of what is known in the relational literature as ` best - matching ' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure is fully explained in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : pfb ]    , showing a horizontally lifted curve from the base space . ]    for this geometric approach , one can think of configuration space as an infinite - dimensional principal fiber bundle @xmath237 , foliated by the group orbits of the diffeomorphisms @xmath238 , acting by pull - backs ( and scalar transformations , acting by pointwise multiplication).diff ( see @xcite ) , one can make sense of this as a principal fiber bundle if one considers only the diffeomorphisms which fix one point of @xmath8 , and a linear frame on it . @xcite . ]    in this case , best - matching , or the gauge connection in riem , is given by a linear action @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the corresponding ( infinite - dimensional ) lie algebra ( for instance @xmath241 with the lie bracket for diffeomorphisms ) and @xmath237 .    as in usual formulations of gauge symmetry in principal fiber bundle language",
    ", this gives a projection @xmath242 into a ` horizontal ' component of the metric velocity ( see @xcite for a quick introduction to principal fiber bundles ) .",
    "that is , in the lagrangian formulation , a  preferred shift \" defining an equilocality relation  called the  best - matched coordinates",
    " emerges from a connection form ( see @xcite for details on how these mechanisms are constructed ) .    in plain words ,",
    "the role of the connection form ( i.e. of best - matching ) is to project out the pure ` coordinate - change ' component of a metric velocity .",
    "the inverse of the ( conformal ) thin - sandwich differential operator ( see @xcite ) is obtainable by such a form which projects out orthogonal components to the fibers , defining @xmath243 .",
    "if a given supermetric is positive - definite and covariant with respect to the gauge transformations , we can define @xmath243 by the projection orthogonal to the fibers .",
    "this is what is done for instance in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , using the canonical supermetric in riem , @xmath244 ( i.e. the canonical supermetric with zero dewitt parameter ) , one obtains a transverse projection , i.e. @xmath245 .    in @xcite , one uses the supermetric : [ equ : conf_supermetric ] ( v , w)_g:=d^3 xg_0^abcdv_abw_cd where the vectors @xmath246 are taken to transform as @xmath247 under conformal transformations @xmath51 , for @xmath248 a scalar function .",
    "the supermetric is positive definite and is shown to be covariant with respect to conformal diffeomorphisms in section [ sec : observers ] .",
    "be diffeomorphisms , and @xmath249 two scalar transformations , conformal diffemorphisms have group structure @xmath250 where @xmath251 just means scalar multiplication at each @xmath252 as @xmath253 . as with diff , @xmath254 is an infinite - dimensional regular lie group and it acts on @xmath24 on the right as a group of transformations by : @xmath255 ] the integrand in is thus invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "thus , using , one forms a genuine gauge connection from the orthogonal projection , [ corrected]g_^ab=(g^ab-^(b_g^a)[g;x)+_g[g;x)g^ab)this equation defines @xmath256 as a generalized ` transverse traceless ' metric velocity , and @xmath257 , the transverse traceless conditions . ] corrected by infinite - dimensional gauge connections on riem , @xmath258^a$ ] and @xmath259 $ ] , along the diffeomorphism and conformal fibers respectively , which project the velocities into the space orthogonal to the conformal diffeomorphism fibers .    for the more formal mathematical proof that one can indeed obtain a connection form from this orthogonality criterion , one needs to show that the criterion can be expressed as the kernel of an elliptic operator , and use the fredholm alternative in the infinite - dimensional banach space case .",
    "this is done to full detail in @xcite . here",
    "i will just sketch the method .",
    "the trick is to rewrite the full group of diffeomorphisms as a product of the incompressible diffeomorphisms and the pure dilatations .",
    "these are generated by divergenceless vecotr fields and their complements . in that case , we have , we have from an orthogonality condition to the fiber , according to : @xmath260 given a metric velocity , @xmath261 , we want to horizontally correct it , as is the job of the usual covariant derivative : @xmath262 since we want to invert this for @xmath20 and @xmath61 , we look at equations and as equations to be inverted for @xmath263 and @xmath61 in terms of sources given by the metric and its time derivatives .",
    "the condition for the existence of an element of @xmath113 which is both orthogonal to a fiber and parallel to it ( i.e. is both horizontal and vertical ) is that a non - zero @xmath20 exist such that [ equ : ver_hor ] _",
    "a((^(a_^b))=0 where we are taking the divergence - free killing form .",
    "but in our case we the supermetric is positive definite , and thus the only solution is @xmath264 .. ] thus equation only has non - trivial solutions in case the metric has conformal killing vector fields ( since we are taking the transverse part of the vector fields , and so on ) .",
    "we thus construct the two operators on @xmath265 , i.e. @xmath266 and @xmath267 , such that : @xmath268 from which we obtain .",
    "we thus have the geodesic action : [ new action ] s= dt and by virtue of the connection forms in , under a conformal diffeomorphism @xmath269 , the integrand changes covariantly wrt to the diffeomorphisms @xmath21 and invariantly with respect to the conformal transformations , as : @xmath270",
    "an alternative route to prove brst invariance of the gauge - fixed path integral is to use the nakanishi - laudrup trick , and the quadratic form of the gauge - fixing term that comes with it .    by adding a term of the form @xmath271 to the classical action",
    ", we are guaranteed to maintain brst invariance , since @xmath272 .",
    "for this , we institute the same transformations as given in , but now we implement @xmath273 , and @xmath274 both new fields ( the nakanishi - laudrup fields ) have trivial brst variation by nilpotency .",
    "now we choose , for the diffeomorphisms : [ o ] = |^a(_a - g_ac _ b(^cb))we find that : [ equ : brst_total ] _ b=_bg^ba(_a - g_ac _",
    "b(^cb ) ) -|_c _ b(^(c^b))now we can substitute back the solution of the equation of motion for @xmath275 : @xmath276 and thus _",
    "b=_a(^ab)^e(_eb ) -|_c _ b(^(c^b))which yields both a gaussian gauge - fixing ( with spread defined by @xmath277 ) and the ghost lagrangian at once .    but indeed , this is equivalent to using the t hooft trick : adding an arbitrary scalar tensor @xmath278 as a ` source ' in the functional dirac delta , @xmath279 $ ] and then functionally integrating it out as a gaussian ( using the gaussian path integral measure for @xmath280):@xmath281 thus we have that @xmath271 in is equivalent to adding both the gauge - fixing and the ghost terms to the total action , in a manner that is explicitly brst invariant .",
    "although the resulting gauge - fixed path integral is of a more complicated form than , its brst symmetry is more straightforward .",
    "we note that , for regions that approximate a conformally flat space  lets call this the gravitational soft limit ",
    "the leading order terms in the hamiltonian become the gravitational and scalar interactions , with the yang - mills part becoming sub - leading , unless we are in the gravitational adiabatic limit , when @xmath148 also approximates zero at a rate faster than the square root of the cotton tensor .",
    "but more worrisome is the fact that when we calculate the equations of motion for a nearly conformally flat background , metric variations of the yang - mills terms in the lagrangian  which should be the energy momentum tensor to source the gravitational equations of motion  will diverge with a different power than the gravitational+scalar part ( again , unless we are in the gravitational adiabatic limit ) . after some calculation",
    ", that would likely obligate us to set the coefficients of the vector lagrangian to zero .",
    "this conclusion seems dangerous phenomenologically , for it would require vanishing yang - mills fields in regions that are nearly conformally flat and not gravitationally adiabatic . in that case",
    "we would have only two alternatives , as far as i can see : either to let the yang - mills fields break conformal invariance or to have the coupling constants transform under conformal transformations of the metric , which would still demand that the electromagnetic term transform covariantly with respect to conformal transformations ( i.e. so that it does not contain derivatives of the conformal factor ) .",
    "both alternatives are written as : [ equ : vector_lagrangian2 ]  _ = d^3 x_((a_a-_a_a+_a)g^ab(a_b-_a_b+_b)- _ _ [ aa_b]g^acg^bd_[ca_d ] )    if @xmath282 do nt conformally transform , both terms now break conformal invariance , with different powers in fact : for @xmath283 , the @xmath284 term scales as @xmath285 and the @xmath286 term as @xmath287 .",
    "this looks a lot like hoavas anisotropic scaling @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath288 would also transform as the @xmath284 term . if the couplings do transform conformally , this brings issues of its own , and we would presumably need to use the methods of the local renormalization group flow to study the running of these couplings @xcite .",
    "we note that some semblance of lorentz symmetry has in any case been restored , with @xmath289 playing the role of @xmath290 .",
    "we also note that upon a conformal transformation @xmath283 , we can solve the equations of motion for the conformal factor , setting : @xmath291 .",
