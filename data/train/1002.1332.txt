    "with the process of globalization , the contacts between people of different areas become much more frequent than before , which makes the epidemic turn into an increasingly huge challenge for human beings . in the recent 10 years",
    ", the worldwide deluges of epidemics happened in human societies have been more frequent ( e.g. , the sars in 2003 , the h5n1 in 2006 and h1n1 in 2009 ) .",
    "the epidemic spreads through interactions of human or even animals , and it appears more powerful to damage as the interactions between people or animals get stronger , under the current global environment , the effective precaution actions should be made and taken according to available studies .",
    "complex networks , as models of interactions in many real areas , such as society , technology and biology @xcite , have provided a practical perspective for studying the epidemic spreading processes accompanying the real interactions .",
    "the spreading processes can be regarded as dynamic processes on complex networks @xcite .",
    "hence , studying the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of epidemic spreading on complex networks , which can be applied to a wide range of areas , ranging from computer virus infections @xcite , epidemiology such as the spreading of h1n1 , sars and hiv @xcite , to other spreading phenomena on communication and social networks , such as rumor propagation @xcite , has attracted many scientists attentions .",
    "there are two main aspects of such studies .",
    "one is to aim at setting the spreading mechanisms .",
    "for the epidemic spreading , the classical models include sis ( susceptive - infected - susceptive ) model and sir ( susceptive - infected - remove ) model@xcite .",
    "the other one is focused on researching the dynamic processes of epidemic spreading on networks with different topological structures @xcite which have an essential effect on the dynamic processes of epidemic spreading . in regular , random and small - world networks",
    ", the studies of epidemic spreading all found that the dynamic processes undergo a phase transition : the effective spreading rate needs to exceed a critical threshold for a disease to become epidemic @xcite .",
    "however , accompanied by the discovery that more and more networks have a scale - free distribution of degree , the absence of a critical threshold has been revealed in the studies of epidemic spreading in scale - free networks @xcite",
    ".    epidemic spreading always follows the mobilities of human and animal .",
    "recently , many empirical studies and theoretical analysis on the pattern of animal foraging , migration and human traveling have presented that these mobility patterns possess a levy flights property with an exponent @xmath0 ( @xmath1 for human)@xcite .",
    "levy flights means when human and animal travel , the step size @xmath2 follows a power - law distribution @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "apparently , these mobility patterns can not be depicted only by the topology of networks ; hence , the characteristics of epidemic spreading following animal and human mobility pattern should be observed on a network with specific spatial structure .",
    "this work is to aim at abstracting a network to describe the levy flights mobility pattern and study the dynamic process of epidemic spreading on spatial network .    in this paper",
    "we study how the mobility pattern affects epidemic spreading from the network perspective , and especially , pay more attention to the extremely rapid spreading epidemics .",
    "we construct a weighted network with levy flights spatial structure to describe the levy flights mobility pattern . in this network",
    ", each node denotes a small area and the weight on the edge denotes the communication times or the quantities people or animal flow between the corresponding two small areas . and , as all the individuals only have limited energy , there must be a cost constraint on the mobility .",
    "considering this limitation , we let the consumed energy by one communication between any two small areas be proportional to the geographical distance between them .",
    "we hypothesize that the distributions of human and animal mobility energy are both homogenous",
    ". then all nodes can be think than they have the same energy , which can simplify the analysis considerably .",
    "unfortunately , we have no the data about human mobility and just have deer and sheep moving data to support the hypothesis . from fig .",
    "[ empirical ] , we can see that the distributions of consumed energy ( the sum of distances for a sheep or deer in a day ) for both sheep and deer are very narrow , thus the energy distribution can be looked as homogenous .",
    "the spatial levy flights network can be constructed as follows .",
    "based on a energy constraint uniform @xmath4 nodes cycle ( 1-dimensional lattice ) , for each node , connections are added with power law distance distribution @xmath5 randomly until the energy are exhausted .",
    "each realization can generate a specific spatial weighted network . according to levy flights mobility pattern ( @xmath6 ,",
    "the weight @xmath7 on the link between node @xmath8 and @xmath9 should be proportional to @xmath10 , and for a given network size , the sum of all @xmath11 should be a constant which denotes the energy constraint .",
    "so , we can get an ensemble network model of these spatial weighted networks generated by many times of realization as : @xmath12    solve the model we can get the network as : @xmath13 where , @xmath14 denotes the total energy , @xmath15 is a constant and @xmath16 denotes the expectation of one levy flights distance . obviously , the network is a full connected weighted network and each node is same with the degree @xmath17",
    "so far we have constructed the one - dimensional levy flights network .",
    "sis epidemiological network model is the standard model for studying epidemic spreading @xcite . in sis endemic network ,",
    "each node has only two states , susceptive or infected . at each step , the susceptive node @xmath8 is infected with rate @xmath18 if connected to one infected node .",
    "hence in the weighted network , the node @xmath8 will be infected with the rate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the set of infected nodes . and",
    "at the next time , infected nodes are cured and become susceptive with rate @xmath21 .",
    "the effective spreading rate @xmath22 , is defined as @xmath23 . in order to keep the model simple and without loss of generality , we always let @xmath24 , which implies that all the infected nodes will be cured in the next step . for many networks ,",
    "the epidemic threshold of @xmath22 is a very significant index to measure the dynamic processes of epidemic spreading on the networks @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath25 is the epidemic threshold of a network which means that when @xmath26 the infection dies out exponentially and when @xmath27 the infection spreads and will always exist in the network .",
    "suppose @xmath28 denotes the fraction of infected node in the network , following the homogeneous mean - field approximation @xcite , the dynamical rate equations for the sis model are @xmath29(1-\\rho)\\label{rf}\\ ] ] the first term in eq .",
    "( [ rf ] ) , which is set @xmath30 , is the recovery rate of infected nodes .",
    "the second term takes into account the expected probability that a susceptive node to get the infection on this weighted network @xmath31 $ ] . employing taylor expansions and ignoring the infinitesimal value of higher order , when @xmath32 the epidemic threshold @xmath33 when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 . from the eq .",
    "( [ rf ] ) , we have @xmath37 for any @xmath28 . in order to keep @xmath38",
    ", the @xmath39 must tend to @xmath30 when @xmath35 .",
    "in conclusion we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is riemann zeta function .",
    "( [ th ] ) shows that @xmath25 has a transition at @xmath42 .",
    "the simulated and analytical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ critical ] which are match well .",
    "more over , the results can be easily extended to high - dimensional space .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) shows that the epidemic is liable to disappear ( @xmath43 ) if there are more long - distance connections than short ones ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is an interesting and counterintuitive conclusion .",
    "intuitively , the epidemic will get more chances to spread and consequently it will infect a wider range of people under the condition that there are more long - distance connections .",
    "however , under the restriction on the total energy , more long - distance connections for a node mean a cost of a sharp decline in the number of short - distance connections for exchange .",
    "hence , accompanied by the decrease of the interactions between nodes , epidemic spreading becomes recession and liable to disappear .",
    "on @xmath44 under @xmath45 .",
    "it shows the critical threshold @xmath39 obtained by the numeric simulation model and reaction equations under different exponent @xmath44 .",
    "green line shows the analytical critical threshold represented by eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) , there is a phase transition on @xmath42 . when @xmath34 , the epidemic threshold burst mounting up into @xmath30 , and when @xmath32 , the epidemic threshold is small values . because when @xmath46 , it is very hard to calculate @xmath39 around -2 .",
    "we use a line to represent in the very small region around -2.,width=264 ]    for many epidemics such as hiv , if one is infected , he / she can not be cured and always has a possibility to infect others . while with many other extremely rapid spreading epidemics such as h1n1 and sars , we always ignore them or have no antibiotics to control them at the very beginning of spreading . in these conditions ,",
    "si model is a reasonable model to study the spreading process .",
    "there is only one difference between sis and si model . in sis model",
    ", an infected node will have a probability to become susceptive , while , in si model , when a node is infected , it can not be cured and always will infect other susceptive nodes . according to the outbreaks of h1n1 and sars , we know that there are always a few infected individuals and even only one infected individual in some cases .",
    "so , in the following numerical experiments , we preset only one node to be infected at the beginning and the effective spreading rate @xmath47 always .",
    "the spreading processes are simulated on networks with different network size .",
    "at first , we investigate the dependence of infected ratio on spreading time . as shown in fig .",
    "[ spread ratio ] , we can see that when @xmath42 , the epidemic spread fastest under each network size .",
    "then , we also studied the dependence of terminal time @xmath48 ( at @xmath48 , all nodes are infected ) on @xmath44 and we find that when @xmath15 is not too large , @xmath48 achieves the lowest value around the point of @xmath42 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ optimal ] ) .",
    "moreover for not too large energy @xmath15 , @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath42 , @xmath50 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ speed ] ) .    in the spatial weighted network ,",
    "the spreading process is the most efficient when @xmath42 .",
    "can we get a similar conclusion in the cases of higher dimensional ?",
    "it is still an open question because it seems tough to explain why epidemic spreading is fastest when @xmath42 by using strict mathematical analysis , and the numeric simulations on high - dimensional networks are too expensive to do .",
    "however , we speculate this conclusion can be extended to the cases of higher dimensional .",
    "recent studies have presented that , with the constraint @xmath14 , the average shortest path length @xmath51 also achieves the lowest value when @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "so , we investigate the relationship between terminal time @xmath48 and the average shortest path length @xmath51 .",
    "however , it is not convenient to obtain the average shortest path length for the spatial weighted network .",
    "the reason is that large @xmath7 means node @xmath8 and @xmath9 are very close , that is to say , we have to transform this kind of weight if we want to obtain the shortest path which is of great importance to us . in order to avoid transformation ,",
    "we construct another un - weighted network which is similar to spatial weighted network .",
    "based on a given uniform cycle network , we randomly add connections which hold the above constraint and by avoiding duplicated link to obtain an un - weighted network . by observing all phenomena detected on the above spatial weighted network , we find that the average shortest path length @xmath51 indeed affects the spreading speed almost linearly , shown as in fig .",
    "[ hh ] and fig .",
    "[ hhh ] , although , the slops at the two sides of @xmath42 are slight different .",
    "this difference implies that there are some other factors which also affect the spreading speed besides the average shortest path length .",
    "we believe that in high - dimensional networks with levy flights spatial structure , the epidemic also spreads fastest when @xmath42 . in the future",
    "we will try our best to solve the question .    . * a. * spread ratio under @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",

    "it observes the impact of network size on terminal time under various exponent @xmath44 and energy @xmath15 .",

    "in summary , this paper presents the relationship between epidemic spreading and the mobility pattern of human and animal from the network perspective . acknowledging that the mobility pattern of human and animal follows the levy flights pattern with an exponent @xmath0 , we find that the levy flights mobility pattern is very efficient for epidemic spreading when @xmath42 .",

    "the special mobility pattern has evolved since animal appeared on the earth .",
    "maybe it is very useful for searching foods , diffusing good genes or many others which are very important for species developing .",
