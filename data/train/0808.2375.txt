    "star formation is a fundamental process in the universe .",
    "dense , gravitationally bound , and genuinely starless cores , which we call here `` prestellar cores '' , are the earliest visible precursors of forming stars .",
    "the interplay between gravitation and thermal / magnetic pressure as well as the conservation of angular momentum are all driving forces behind prestellar core evolution .",
    "while the thermal structure is determined by dust properties and molecular composition , magnetic support is sensitive to the ionization degree .",
    "the interaction and relative importance of these processes as well as the role of external forces are still not well understood ( see , e.g. reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is important to study the physical and chemical evolution of these cores in detail to reveal the underlying physics .",
    "the interiors of such prestellar cores are well - shielded from interstellar or stellar radiation , leading to low internal temperatures . under such conditions ,",
    "the main component of these cores , h@xmath0 , is not easily observable .",
    "therefore , we have to rely on indirect methods to determine the physical structure of prestellar cores , e.g. , on observations of thermal dust emission or emission lines from other molecules , like co , cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "observations of spectral lines have an important advantage over continuum observations since they also carry information about kinematics of the gas .",
    "a disadvantage of molecular tracers can be that they are only present under certain conditions and can be frozen - out on dust surfaces .",
    "numerous studies , including single - dish and interferometric observations along with their theoretical analysis , have been performed over the past years , significantly deepening our understanding of the physical and chemical processes in star - forming regions ( see , e.g. reviews of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , deriving physical properties from molecular lines is a difficult ( inverse ) problem because of the many factors which can affect the line formation .",
    "even if we assume that the studied object is spherically symmetric and uniform , we have to specify at least 5 independent parameters describing the formation of molecular lines .",
    "these are density @xmath2 , kinetic temperature @xmath3 , molecular column density @xmath4 , radial velocity @xmath5 , and micro - turbulent velocity @xmath6 . in more realistic models , additional parameters",
    "should also be considered , e.g. , electron concentration and external radiation field , with spatial distributions of all the above parameters .",
    "an exact analytical treatment of this multi - parameter system is , in most cases , impossible .",
    "optically thin line formation can be described analytically to some extent ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is very difficult to do the same for optically thick lines .",
    "also , it is difficult to use analytic methods to solve the inverse problem , i.e. , to restore physical distributions of relevant parameters from observed spectra because of the non - local and non - linear nature of the radiative transfer problem .",
    "this is why numerical line radiative transfer ( lrt ) models are commonly used as an exploratory tool .",
    "several reliable numerical methods and numerical codes have been developed by various groups for this purpose ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are also fast approximate numerical tools available for the molecular line radiative transfer analysis @xcite .",
    "however , input data for line modeling include not only physical conditions but also distributions of molecular abundances .",
    "all these data can be represented with some analytical prescription or extracted from chemical and dynamical models .    as recently outlined by @xcite",
    ", there are two alternative approaches to the diagnostics of protostellar objects .",
    "the first approach is a systematic study of the influence of various factors on emergent spectra in order to facilitate the analysis of forthcoming observations",
    ". such studies ( based mainly on approximate lrt methods ) have already started more than 30 years ago with the analysis of the excitation conditions for various molecules and effects of the density , temperature and velocity gradients on the emission line profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the alternative approach is a detailed study of an individual source . to infer its parameters ,",
    "a number of models is constructed and the direct lrt problem is solved for each model .",
    "varying the model parameters , it is possible to find the combination which provides the best agreement between observed and modeled spectra ( maps ) or their derived parameters , like , e.g. , velocity centroids @xcite or line ratios @xcite . both trial - and - error methods or any sophisticated numerical algorithm for isolating the `` best ''   set of free parameters can be utilized @xcite . this second approach has already been successfully applied in a number of studies , aimed to extract detailed characteristics of pre - stellar and protostellar objects from observed spectra , in particular , their chemical and kinematical structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as to test different star formation theories ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following the first approach , efforts of various authors are mainly concentrated toward evolutionary stages later than the prestellar phase .",
    "most cores investigated in detail are closer to the formation of a first hydrostatic core , when the collapse is well - developed and can be described by shu or larson - penston solutions .",
    "this interest may be partly caused by the fact that first proofs of infall have been reported for class0 objects @xcite , in which the collapse has already resulted in the formation of a deeply embedded source .",
    "@xcite considered spectral differences between shu and larson - penston solutions , assuming constant molecular abundances , and identified four line properties , supposedly unique to collapsing cores . @xcite",
    "combined a dynamical description , based on the shu model , with a detailed chemical model and identified species with broad line wings , indicative of infall motions .",
    "@xcite coupled a similar chemical and dynamical model to a more realistic radiation transfer model , implemented as an approximate @xmath7-iteration code , and studied the sensitivity of emergent central optically thin and optically thick spectra to various model parameters .",
    "the assumption of isothermality , used by @xcite and @xcite , was relaxed in @xcite in application to a `` b335-like '' class  0 object .",
    "the sensitivity of line profiles in this model to the intensity of the ambient radiation field was studied in @xcite .",
    "the influence of various parameters on class  0 central spectra , with a particular emphasis on turbulence and rotation , was also studied by @xcite under the assumption of flat abundance distributions .",
    "the role of high angular resolution in studying such clouds was investigated by @xcite .",
    "more details about line modeling can be also found in review by @xcite .",
    "large amounts of data have also been accumulated for starless cores , most of which are presumably `` prestellar '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , together with the theoretical modeling of molecular lines .",
    "e.g. , @xcite investigated the effects of depletion on the line intensity .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of line profiles during core contraction based on the models where the chemical evolution is calculated along with dynamical evolution of the cloud .",
    "@xcite investigated the combined effects of temperature and depletion , and @xcite investigated the possibility to use approximate analytical models to extract velocity gradients from the line profiles . in principle , all the mentioned studies of line formation in protostellar objects are also relevant for prestellar cores .",
    "however , despite the obvious observational and theoretical progress , the interpretation of the data is still far from being straightforward , as infall and rotation velocities in prestellar cores are both comparable or even smaller than the sound speed . difficulties in restoring the information about structural , thermal , and kinematic properties are also caused by the lack of relevant methods for molecular line analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the formation of molecular lines in prestellar cores and present different tools which can be used to analyze the formation of lines in detail . using the linear molecules co and hco@xmath1 as examples , we model their emission by means of non - lte lrt simulations .",
    "the role of hydrogen density , molecular column density , kinetic temperature , infall , and rotation is examined and illustrated in the paper .",
    "such an analysis may form the basis of a more sophisticated interpretation of observational data and can be useful for those who are going to use lrt simulations in their studies or want to get a global view of the factors influencing observed line profiles .    in section  2",
    "we describe the radiation transfer model used in the paper , introduce parameters to characterize line profiles , and provide some basic considerations on the line formation in prestellar cores . in section  3",
    "we show how molecular line characteristics depend on hydrogen density , molecular column density , and kinetic temperature for the parameter sample of uniform model clouds . in section  4",
    "we consider a non - uniform model cloud and study the effects of chemical stratification , contraction and rotation on spectral line maps . in section  5",
    "we discuss additional problems related to the lrt analysis .",

    "however , it is still difficult to use such models for the _ quantitative _ analysis , mainly because of two reasons .",

    "when @xmath130 is low , hco@xmath1(10 ) traces lower densities ( fig .",
    "[ core - chem]d ) .",
    "it must be noted that the description used in this subsection is somewhat simplified in the sense that it does not take into account the temperature gradient which may appear due to enhanced uv irradiation and/or cr flux .",

    "the contribution chart for the central spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ explain2 ] ) has a complex appearance , which , in general , follows the projected velocity ( white curve in fig .  [ explain2 ] ) .",
    "there is a common perception that optically thick lines trace outer parts of the source .",
    "however , as we see from the chart in fig .",
    "[ explain2 ] , in general , the line profile includes information about different parts of the cloud . the integrated contribution function ( fig .",
    "[ explain2]-icf ) shows that both near and far parts of the core participate in the formation of the central spectrum . as in the static case ( fig .",
    "[ explain1 ] ) , the emission around the dip ( at zero velocity ) and in the red peak comes from the envelope part closest to the observer .",
    "however , this region contributes some emission in the blue peak as well .",
    "the most of the emission in the blue peak comes from the rear part of the model core ( a hallmark of the infall asymmetry ) and also from its center .",
    "the gap between the near and rear parts of the contribution function ( fig .",

    "self - absorption spectra toward centers of some prestellar cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are dominated by red peaks , as if the corresponding core is expanding .",
    "the asymmetry of the line profile in a particular core can also be caused by an outflow powered by an unseen central object ( protostar ) .",
    "in addition , spectral maps of some cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that their kinematics can not be described as pure contraction , expansion and/or rotation .",
    "@xcite suggested that the velocity field in these prestellar cores can be reproduced by a model of an oscillating pressure - bounded , thermally - supported object .",
    "if we , for the purpose of discussion , consider a model of an expanding core by changing the velocity sign , we end up with a spectral map and contribution chart for the central spectrum , which are just mirror reflections of the same plots for the model of contracting core but with the opposite asymmetry . in general",
    ", a detailed dynamical model is needed to quantify such motions .",
    "now , we assume that the core does not collapse , but rotate with the axis being perpendicular to the line of sight .",

    "finally , let us assume the more realistic case , i.e. that the core is collapsing and rotating at the same time .",

    "the effects of infall and rotation are coherent and profiles are strongly blue - dominated . on the right side of the map , infall and rotation tend to produce opposide line asymmetries ( see fig .  [ explain2][explain3 ] ) and their net result is the formation of nearly symmetric line profiles . to the left of the rotation axis ,",
    "profiles are blue - shifted , while to its right they are red - shifted , as in the case of pure rotation .",

    "the projection of the regular velocity onto the line of sight is shown with a white line.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    combination of collapse and rotation allows to reproduce the spectral features observed in a number of molecular cores .",
    "in particular , @xcite used a similar model for the cb17 prestellar core and derived the infall and rotation velocity by fitting the maps of optically thin and optically thick lines simulteneously .",
    "the presence of both rotation and infall is also seen in the l1544 core @xcite . to distinguish between rotation and infall",
    "it is also useful to use the first - moment maps , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "starless cores arguably represent the simplest configuration among all stages of the formation of a low - mass star . despite this simplicity , the interpretation of observed spectra is not straightforward , especially , in terms of kinematics , because regular motions in these objects have velocities which are comparable to or even less than the sound speed .",
    "above , we have given some examples of molecular line formation in static and dynamic cores , demonstrating how line profiles are influenced by gas density and temperature , molecular abundance , presence of regular motions , and external parameters which drive the chemical evolution .",
    "contribution charts show clearly that any optically thick line , generally speaking , does not represent some specific part of the core but rather combines contributions from different regions .",
    "incidentally , this is what makes it possible to use optically thick lines as a diagnostic for core - wide kinematics . on the other hand , while the contribution function in general follows the regular velocity profile , emission at a given velocity is not unambiguously related to a region which moves with this velocity , bearing information from other regions as well because of finite microturbulent line broadening .",
    "there are some other potential complications which are not accounted for in the present paper .",
    "in particular , in the models presented above , the gas temperature is assumed to be uniform over the core . in reality , the thermal structure of starless cores can be more complex . following the theoretical considerations , the gas temperature is a result of heating by cosmic rays , photoelectric heating , collisional exchange with dust , and cooling by atomic and molecular lines . the dust temperature , in turn ,",
    "is mostly controlled by external radiation and expected to rise from inside ( @xmath142  k ) to outside ( @xmath143  k ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "cooling by molecular and atomic lines depends on the abundance of key species , like co , c and c@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to estimate the gas temperature distribution one needs to model the chemical structure , line radiative transfer , and the energy exchange between gas and dust .",
    "@xcite showed that the thermal structure of starless cores may differ depending on their central density . for cores with high central density ( @xmath144 @xmath63 ) ,",
    "the temperature rises from inside to outside , while for less dense cores the temperature distribution is more uniform , which seems to be supported by observations of several prestellar cores .",
    "as shown by @xcite over - simplified thermal models may lead to wrong interpretations of line data .",
    "thus , the thermal structure of the starless cores should be considered in the lrt simulations .",
    "in fact , the sensitivity of co lines to the gas temperature in the envelope makes it possible to use these lines to constrain the uv part of the radiation field , while the dust rt modeling allows to estimate the overall level of the interstellar radiation field , ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    from the observational side",
    ", there is a convolution problem which is related to the finite resolution of radio - telescopes .",
    "if the telescope beam is comparable to the angular size of an object then different regions contribute to the emergent line profile which makes derivation of source parameters even more difficult and often ambiguous .",
    "there are also some uncertainties which are related to the lrt problem itself .",
    "one of them is the commonly used assumption of the full frequency redistribution ( ffr ) over the line profile which dramatically simplifies equations of the lrt ( e.g. , the source function does not depend on frequency ) .",
    "however , this assumption may not be valid in low density regions where collisions are not frequent enough to redistribute the absorbed energy . as a result",
    ", the line formation may proceed in a way between two extreme modes , namely , between ffr and coherent scattering . in the latter case , lines would not have any self - absorption dips ( but shapes can still be complex because of the regular velocity ) .",
    "another commonly used approach is to simplify the non - regular ( turbulent ) velocity field in cores by introducing the micro - turbulence velocity ( eq .  [ [ vturb ] ] ) .",
    "such representation of the real ( unknown ) velocity field by the combination of the regular and microturbulent velocities also may lead to misinterpretations .",
    "for instance , line asymmetry can be considered as an evidence of infall ( outflow ) , being actually a reflection of a complex kinematic structure due to turbulence or oscillations . moreover , even if we are not interested in line shapes , the microturbulent approach can fail in reproducing line intensities . as shown by , e.g. , @xcite , the turbulent structure of prestellar cores",
    "can be rather represented by meso - turbulence which again requires the modification of the radiative transfer equation .",
    "in this paper we analyze molecular line formation at conditions typical of starless cores . in particular , we show the effect of density , molecular column density , and temperature on line parameters for a sample of uniform clouds .",
    "we also consider non - uniform models and show the effect of the chemical differentiation , collapse and rotation on the molecular spectral maps .",
    "we present a chart of line formation which may serve as valuable tool for understanding results of lrt simulations .",
    "this chart clearly demonstrates which parts of the model core contribute to the line profile at each velocity .",
    "* densities in starless cores fall into the range where level populations are neither radiatively , nor collisionally dominated . *",
    "large column densities do not necessarily lead to the appearance of self - absorption dips .",
    "* when the column density is fixed , a specific line can be optically thick only in a range of densities , being optically thin at densities both below and above this range . *",
    "the density which is `` traced '' by some transition depends on external factors ( uv field and cr ionization ) , which shape the molecular distribution .",
    "in particular , the `` traced '' density can be lower than the critical density .",
    "* rotation and infall may produce very similar spectra and in general can only be distinguished by spectral mapping .",
