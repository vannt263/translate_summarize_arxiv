    "consider the following conversation between two students :    first student : ` suppose i am falling into a black hole . by the equivalence principle",
    ", i will notice nothing special at the horizon .",
    "hawking has argued that radiation from such a horizon has a thermal spectrum , which means that the radiation can carry no information and information will be lost when the black hole evaporates . '",
    "second student : ` i know that this is called the information paradox , but i think there are many weaknesses in hawking s argument . the radiation he computes starts as transplankian modes , so it is wrong to treat those modes like free field modes , as hawking did . in any case",
    "there is no information paradox in string theory because we know that black holes in ads at least are dual to a field theory , and the field theory is manifestly unitary . '",
    "i will argue in these notes that each phrase in the above conversation is either incorrect or is irrelevant to the information problem .",
    "some forty years after hawking became famous for finding this problem , one of the most paradoxical things is that the black hole information paradox is so well known and yet so poorly understood .",
    "a principal goal of these lectures will therefore be to understand exactly what the paradox _",
    "is_. we will see that there is a very precise statement of the contradiction found by hawking , and that bypassing the paradox needs a basic change in our understanding of how quantum effects operate in gravity .",
    "we develop the ideas underlying the paradox in a number of steps , starting with very basic principles . it is essential to understand these principles ,",
    "because even though we use them automatically in our everyday use of physics , it is these same principles which are being challenged by the information paradox .",
    "general relativity has brought several complications to physics . in particular , space and time can ` stretch ' , and we are then forced to extend quantum theory to curved spacetime . in our solar system",
    "we have space - time curvature , but we believe that we can do laboratory experiments without worrying about details of quantum gravity .",
    "why is that ?",
    "the vacuum of a free quantum field in flat space has fourier modes of all wavelengths going down to zero .",
    "when quantum gravity is taken into account , what will be the behavior of modes with wavelengths shorter than planck length ?",
    "we do not fully understand the answer to such questions , and if it were the case that the full physics of quantum gravity were needed for describing _ any _ process , then we would not be able to do much physics .",
    "the reason that we do not worry about quantum gravity in everyday experiments is that we believe there is an appropriate limit where the effects of quantum gravity become small , and a local , well defined , approximate evolution equation becomes possible .",
    "the existence of this limit is so crucial to physics , that i use a specific name for it in these notes : ` solar system physics ' .",
    "the term signifies that we can do normal physics when spacetime curvatures are of the order found in our solar system .",
    "* definition d1 : solar system limit : *    we have not yet specified these niceness conditions n , but the fact that there must exist such a ` solar system limit ' underlies all of our physical thinking . hawking s theorem starts with a natural set of niceness conditions n , and proves that requiring locality with these conditions would lead to an ` unacceptable ' physical evolution . one must then either agree to this ` unacceptable evolution ' , or find a way to add new conditions to the set n , in such a way that these conditions still allow us to define a ` solar system limit ' incorporating some idea of locality .      here",
    "we make a list of ` niceness conditions ' that are traditionally assumed , whether explicitly or implicitly :    ( n1 ) our quantum state is defined on a spacelike slice .",
    "the intrinsic curvature @xmath0 of this slice should be much smaller than planck scale everywhere : @xmath1 .",
    "( n2 ) the spacelike slice sits in an 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "let us require that the slice be nicely embedded in the full spacetime ; i.e. , the _ extrinsic _ curvature of the slice @xmath2 is small everywhere : @xmath3 .",
    "( n3 ) the 4-curvature curvature of the full spacetime in the neighbourhood of the slice should be small everywhere @xmath4    ( n4 ) we should require that all matter on the slice be ` good ' .",
    "thus any quanta on the slice should have wavelength much longer than planck length ( @xmath5 ) , and the energy density @xmath6 and momentum density @xmath7 should be small everywhere compared to planck density : @xmath8 .",
    "let us add here that we will let all matter satisfy the usual energy conditions ( say , the dominant energy condition ) .",
    "( n5 ) we will evolve the state on the initial slice to a later slice ; all slices encountered should be ` good ' as above .",
    "further , the lapse and shift vectors needed to specify the evolution should change smoothly with position : @xmath9    note that not all these conditions may be independent , but we have tried to be as generous as possible in making sure that we are in a domain of semiclassical physics .",
    "while we have tried to make sure that the spacetime is such that quantum gravity can be ignored , we have to do a little more : we have to be more precise about what physical process we are interested in looking at .",
    "the reason is simple .",
    "there is always _ some _ effect of quantum gravity , so if we insist on making a very precise measurement of something or look at some very abstruse physical effect , we might pick up effects of quantum gravity even in gently curved spacetime .",
    "so we will now pick the physical process of interest .    *",
    "a set of nice slices : * start with the vacuum state on the lower slice in fig.[fone](a ) .",
    "consider the evolution to the upper slice shown in the figure .",
    "the later slice is evolved forward in the right hand region , less so in the left hand region .",
    "this is of course allowed : in general relativity we have ` many - fingered time ' in the language of wheeler , so we can evolve in any way that we like .",
    "the slices satisfy all the ` niceness ' conditions n.        * 2 .",
    "pair creation : * the evolution of the geometry will lead to particle creation in the region where the geometry of the slice is being deformed ; this happens because the vacuum state on one slice will not in general be the natural vacuum on a later slice .",
    "let the geometry in the deformation region be characterized by the length and time scale @xmath10 .",
    "then the particle pairs created have wavelengths @xmath11 and the number of such created pairs is @xmath12 .",
    "for concreteness we will take @xmath13 which is the curvature length scale at the horizon of a solar mass black hole .",
    "the particle pair is depicted by @xmath14 in figure fig.[fone](b ) .",
    "the state of the created pairs is of the form |_pair = ce^ ^^|0_c|0_b [ actualstate ] where @xmath15 is a number of order unity .",
    "the detailed form of this state can be found in @xcite .",
    "but the essence of this entanglement can be obtained by assuming the following simple form for the state |_pair=_c_b+_c_b [ pairs ] where in fig.[fone](b ) the quantum of the right is called @xmath16 and the quantum on the left is called @xmath17 .    *",
    "3 . matter on the slice : * there is some matter in a state @xmath18 on the spacelike slice , but the crucial point is that this matter is very far away , a distance @xmath19 from the place where the pair creation is taking place . for concreteness , we will take @xmath20 ( fig.[fone](c ) ) .",
    "( this is the length scale that we will encounter in the hawking evaporation problem of the solar mass hole . )    * 4 .",
    "locality : * if we now assume ` locality ' on the spacelike slices then the complete state on the spacelike slice would be ||_m ( _ c_b+_c_b ) [ qtwo ] even though the matter @xmath18 is far away from the place where the pairs are being created , there will always be _ some _ effect of @xmath18 on the state of the create pairs .",
    "this is why we have written an @xmath21 sign in ( [ qtwo ] ) .",
    "but it is crucial to hawking s argument that we make this more precise .",
    "let the state of matter @xmath18 consist of a single spin which can be up or down .",
    "let us take @xmath22",
    ". then if there was no effect of the matter state @xmath18 on the state of the pairs , the state on the slice would be |(|_m+|_m ) ( _ c_b+_c_b ) [ qtwop ] it is crucial to understand that locality allows small departures from the state ( [ qtwop ] ) , for example |= ( |_m+|_m ) ,  1 [ qthree ] but not a completely different state like |=(_m_c+_m_c)(_b+_b ) [ qfour ]    * 5 .",
    "quantifying locality : * let us now quantify the sense in which ( [ qthree ] ) is close to ( [ qtwop ] ) but ( [ qfour ] ) is not . for the state ( [ qtwop ] ) write the density matrix describing the quantum @xmath16 , while tracing over the degrees of freedom in @xmath23 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is entangled with @xmath17 , but not with @xmath23 .",
    "one finds the entanglement entropy s_ent =- tr [ ] = 2 doing the same computation for the state ( [ qthree ] ) gives s_ent =- tr [ ] = 2-^2(6 - 22)2 but with the state ( [ qfour ] ) we get s_ent=0    now we can make a precise statement about the consequence of assuming locality .",
    "consider the limit 1 ,  ll_p1 ,  ll1 [ limit1 ] the first two inequalities say that all length scales are much longer than planck length , and the last says that the matter @xmath23 is ` far away ' from the place where the pairs are being created .",
    "note that both the length and time scales involved in the pair creation process are @xmath24 .",
    "the above limits are amply satisfied by the scales we took in fig.[fone ] .",
    "now we can express the notion of locality in the following way ( [ limit1 ] ) _ we will get _ -11",
    "the above discussion was very general , but let us now apply it to the black hole with metric ds^2=-(1 - 2mr ) dt^2+(1 - 2mr)^-1 dr^2 + r^2 d_2 ^ 2 [ ten ] this metric has a horizon at @xmath25 .",
    "the curvature in the vicinity of the horizon is low : @xmath26 .",
    "we will call this the ` traditional black hole geometry ' . the essential feature of the traditional geometry that will be of relevance to us is the fact that there is no ` information ' about the hole in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "we call this an ` information - free horizon ' and make this precise with the following definition :    * definition d2 : *    _ a black hole with an infomation - free horizon will be called a ` traditional black hole ' .",
    "_    note that in any curved space there is no unique definition of particles , but if the curvature radius is @xmath27 then for wavemodes with wavelength @xmath28 we _ can _ get a definition of particles in which we can say what ` empty space ' is .",
    "that is , one definition of particle will disagree with another but only in that the two definitions will differ by @xmath29 quanta with @xmath30 . at the black hole horizon",
    "we have the same situation , and one might expect to see order unity quanta with @xmath31 in any natural definition of particles ; hawking radiation quanta that are being created will also fall in this category .",
    "thus ` empty ' in the above definition means that we do not have for instance modes with @xmath32 populated by @xmath29 quanta each .",
    "finally , note that the metric ( [ ten ] ) gives a time - independent black hole geometry .",
    "hawking radiation makes the black hole slowly evaporate , but since the evaporation process is slow , we can describe the traditional black hole by a metric like ( [ ten ] ) at any given point of the evaporation process except near the very end when the black hole becomes planck sized .",
    "the traditional black hole has a spacelike singularity inside the horizon .",
    "if this singularity intersects the spacelike slices of our evolution , then the niceness conditions n would not hold everywhere on the slice , and one would not be able to make hawking s argument . thus it is crucial that we can make a set of spacelike slices that describe a spacetime region @xmath33 , satisfy all the niceness conditions n , and yet capture all the physics of hawking radiation .",
    "we now describe this very important construction of slices .",
    "we make a spacelike slice for the black hole ( [ ten ] ) as follows ( fig.[ftwo ] ) :    \\(a ) for @xmath34 we let the slice be @xmath35    \\(b ) inside @xmath36 the spacelike slices are @xmath37 rather than @xmath38 .",
    "we let the slice be @xmath39 , so that this part of the slice is not near the horizon @xmath25 and not near the singularity @xmath40 .",
    "\\(c ) we join these parts of the slice with a smooth ` connector ' segment @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to check that such a connector can be made so that the slice satisfies all the niceness conditions n which we gave above .",
    "\\(d ) the geometry ( [ ten ] ) gives the time independent black hole , but we will be interested in black holes made by starting with flat space and having a shell of mass @xmath23 collapse towards the origin @xmath40 .",
    "the penrose diagram for this hole is shown in fig.[fthree ] .",
    "with such a hole made by collapse we can follow the @xmath42 part of the slice down to early times before the hole was formed , and then smoothly extend it to @xmath40 ( there is no singularity at @xmath40 at these early times ) .       outside the horizon and @xmath43 inside .",
    "infalling matter is very far from the place where pairs are created ( @xmath44 light years ) when we measure distances along the slice .",
    "curvature length scale is @xmath45 all over the region of evolution covered by the slices @xmath46 . ]",
    "this makes one complete spacelike slice , which we call as @xmath47 in fig.[ftwo ] .",
    "let us now make a ` later ' spacelike slice @xmath48 .",
    "\\(a ) at @xmath34 we take @xmath49 .",
    "\\(b ) the @xmath43 part will be @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "note that the timelike direction for this part of the geometry is in the decreasing @xmath52 direction , so this change @xmath53 is indeed correct for evolution of this part of the slice .",
    "we let @xmath53 be small , and will later take the limit where @xmath54 for convenience .",
    "\\(c ) we again join the parts ( a),(b ) by a smooth ` connector ' segment . in the limit",
    "@xmath54 we can take the geometry of the connector segment @xmath41 to be the same for all slices .",
    "note the very important fact ( which can be seen from fig.[ftwo ] ) that the @xmath43 part of the later slice @xmath55 is _ longer _ than the @xmath43 part of @xmath47 .",
    "this extra part of the slice is needed because the connector segment has to join the @xmath43 part to the @xmath56 part , and the @xmath56 part has been evolved forwards on the later slice .",
    "\\(d ) at early times we again bring the @xmath43 part smoothly down to @xmath40 , at a place where there is no singularity .",
    "let us now see the nature of the evolution from slice @xmath47 to slice @xmath55 .",
    "let us choose lapse and shift vectors on the spacetime as follows .",
    "we take the slice @xmath47 and pick a point @xmath57 on it .",
    "now move along the timelike normal till we reach a point on @xmath48 .",
    "let this point on @xmath48 have the same spatial coordinates @xmath57 .",
    "thus we have set the shift vector to be @xmath58 . with this choice",
    "we can describe the evolution as follows :    \\(a ) in the @xmath38 part of the slice we have no change in intrinsic geometry .",
    "this part of the slice just advances forward in time with a lapse function @xmath59 .",
    "\\(b ) let us work in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath43 part of @xmath47 moves over to @xmath55 with no change in intrinsic geometry .",
    "the early time part which joins this segment to @xmath40 also remains unchanged .",
    "\\(c ) the connector segment @xmath41 of @xmath47 has to ` stretch ' during this evolution , since the corresponding points on @xmath48 will have to cover both the connector @xmath41 of @xmath48 and the extra part of the @xmath43 segment possessed by @xmath48 .",
    "thus we see that the ` stretching ' happens only in the region near the connector segment .",
    "this region has space and time dimensions of order @xmath23 , which is @xmath60 for the solar mass black hole that we have taken as our example .",
    "now consider a succession of slices @xmath61 of this type , evolving from @xmath61 to @xmath62 in exactly the same way that we evolved from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "each evolution from @xmath61 to @xmath62 can be described as follows :    _ divide @xmath61 into a left part , a right part , and a middle part ( which is the connector region ) . in the evolution to @xmath62 , the left and right parts stay unchanged but are pushed apart , and the middle part is stretched to a longer length .",
    "the length of the middle part is @xmath63 , the proper time between the slices in this middle region is @xmath63 , and the stretching is by a factor @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "_        one can now check the following important fact :    * nice slicing of the traditional hole : *    in fact these slices look just like the ones shown in fig.[fone ] .",
    "the curvature is low in all the regions covered by the evolution .",
    "note that while the metric ( [ ten ] ) looks time independent , this is only an illusion because the schwarzschild coordinates break down at the horizon ; any slicing that covers both the outside and the inside of the hole will necessarily be time dependent .",
    "this time - dependence is the underlying reason for particle creation in the black hole geometry .",
    "the slicing of the black hole geometry is very interesting .",
    "all the ` stretching ' between successive slices happens in a given place , so that the fourier modes of fields at this location keep getting stretched to larger wavelengths , and particles will keep being produced ( until the hole becomes very small ) .",
    "we can not have such a set of slices in ordinary minkowski space .",
    "if we try to make slices like those in fig.[ftwo ] in minkowski space , then after some point in the evolution the later slices will not be spacelike everywhere : the ` stretching ' part will become null and then timelike .",
    "but it is the basic feature of the black hole that the space and time directions interchange roles inside the horizon , and we get spacelike slices having a stretching like that of fig.[ftwo ] throughout the region of interest .",
    "looking at such a slicing one might wonder if there should be a problem with stretching a given region of spacetime ` too much ' .",
    "if we could make such a notion concrete , then we could add a new condition to the niceness conditions n , prohibiting ` too much stretching ' .",
    "then the slicing used in the derivation of hawking s theorem would cease to satisfy the niceness conditions , and the information paradox would be bypassed .",
    "but if we add such a condition , then we will have to face its consequences .",
    "our universe starts with a small marble sized ball , and its spatial sections stretch without bound .",
    "if we propose that ` too much stretching ' destroys the ` solar system limit ' , then we have to consider that that this limit will be violated at some point in cosmological evolution .",
    "( in @xcite such a condition was proposed , and its consequence for cosmological evolution was explored in @xcite . ) thus we see that it is not easy to add new conditions to the set",
    "n without suffering serious modifications to physics in other situations .",
    "a second possibility is to argue that while the slicing of the spacetime region itself satisfies the niceness conditions n , there is a singularity in the future of the region covered by the slices , and this could affect the evolution on the slices and generate nonlocal effects .",
    "again , if one wishes to make this argument , one has to make a precise statement of when the niceness conditions will be violated by a singularity in the future .",
    "suppose one does manage to add such a condition to the niceness set n. then what will happen if our universe approaches a big crunch ? there is a singularity in the future , so will we get nonlocal effects all across our spacelike slices ?",
    "also , by time reversal symmetry , if we had a singularity in the past then should it not have similar effects ?",
    "in that case , just after the big bang we should get nonlocal effects across the spacelike slices of our universe , something that we do not build into our normal understanding of cosmology .",
    "so we see again that it is not easy to add new conditions to the set n. in the discussion below we will just take the standard set of niceness conditions given in section [ n ] in exploring the information paradox .",
    "the evolution of slices in the black hole geometry will lead to the creation of particle pairs .",
    "the members of these pairs that float out to infinity are called hawking radiation . in this section",
    "we look at the nature of the wavefunction of these created pairs .",
    "the pairs will form a state which is _ entangled _ in a very specific way , and this fact will form the heart of hawking s theorem .",
    "it is crucial that the state of these pairs is a state unlike any that is created when a normal hot body radiates photons .",
    "we will see that the essential difference arises from the fact that in the black hole case the particle pairs are the result of ` stretching ' of a region of the spacelike slice ; thus these pairs are ` pulled out of the vacuum ' . in normal hot bodies",
    "the radiation is emitted from the constituents making up the hot body .",
    "this is the essential difference between a hot body and the black hole , so we will be returning to this issue repeatedly .    in this section we will see the state of the created pairs ` to leading order ' . if this were the actual state of the pairs , it is easy to see that we can not escape hawking s conclusion .",
    "but of course there will always be small corrections to any leading order computation .",
    "a common misconception is that these small corrections can remove hawking s problem and make the black hole radiation no different from radiation from a hot body .",
    "_ this is absolutely incorrect_. thus in proving hawking s theorem we will explore the space of small corrections to the leading order state and show that _ unless we make an order unity modification to the leading order result , hawking s problem will persist_. well , why not assume then that there are order unity corrections to the lading order state ?",
    "the crucial point of hawking s theorem is that in that case _ there will be breakdown of the solar system limit even if we are given the niceness conditions n_.    this then is the outline of the hawking result",
    ". it would clearly be very difficult to write down all sources of small corrections to the leading order result .",
    "the proof of the theorem does away with the necessity of analyzing these corrections , by simply mapping the evolution to one in a domain of ` solar system physics ' , so that any effect that generates corrections large enough to make the hole radiate like a normal body will be forced to lead to a violation of the solar system limit .    clearly , we need to get a good understanding of evolution in the black hole spacetime . to make the essence of the proof clearer , we start in this section with the leading order hawking state ,",
    "analyze its essential properties , and postpose the investigation of corrections to the next section .",
    "are not created by interaction with either the matter @xmath18 ( represented by the black square ) or with the earlier created pairs .",
    "rather the creation is by a schwinger process which moves @xmath18 further away from the place of pair creation , and also moves the earlier created @xmath14 quanta away from the place of pair creation .",
    "the new pairs are created in a state which to leading order is entangled between the new @xmath66 quanta but not entangled with anything else .",
    "small corrections to this leading order state does not change this entanglement significantly , so the entanglement keeps growing all through the radiation process , unlike the case of radiation from normal hot bodies . ]",
    "\\(1 ) consider an initial spacelike slice .",
    "the shell that collapses to make the hole is represented by a matter state @xmath18 .",
    "\\(2 ) let us evolve to the next spacelike slice .",
    "the ` middle part ' of the spacelike slice stretches , while the left and right parts remain unchanged .",
    "this is shown in fig.[ffour ] .",
    "the stretching creates correlated pairs ( labelled @xmath67 ) and the state on the complete slice is like ( [ qtwo ] ) ||_m ( _ c_1_b_1+_c_1_b_1 ) [ qtwoq ] if we compute the entanglement of @xmath68 with @xmath69 we obtain s_entanglement=2    \\(3 ) now consider the next slice of spacetime in fig.[ffour ] .",
    "the following happens during this step of the evolution :    \\(i ) the matter state @xmath18 stays almost the same because there is no evolution in this part of the slice ( ii ) the change in the geometry happens only in the region where the ` connector ' part joins the @xmath43 part ; in this region there is a ` stretching ' of the spacelike slice .",
    "there are two consequences of this stretching .",
    "the first is that the pairs @xmath67 created earlier move away from each other and from the region of stretching .",
    "the second is that the stretching creates a new set of pairs @xmath70 in the region of stretching .",
    "again , the full state of the quantum field can be found in @xcite , but for our present purposes we can write the state at the end of this step as    the entanglement of the set @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",

    ". the slicing does not satisfy the niceness conditions n after the point when @xmath76 because @xmath77 is no longer true .",
    "we will therefore stop evolving our spacelike slices when this point is reached .",
    "the emitted radiation quanta @xmath78 have an entanglement ( [ ent ] ) with @xmath75 .",
    "we define :    * definition d3 : * _ we will say that our gravity theory contains _ remnants _ if there exists a set of objects with mass and size less than given bounds m < m_remnant ,  l < l_remnant but allowing an arbitrarily high entanglement with systems far away from the object .",
    "_    it is easy to see that an object can be entangled with @xmath79 with another system only if the number of possible states of the object is @xmath80 .",
    "thus remnants have unbounded degeneracy while having energy and size within given bounds .",
    "this is _ not _ the expected behavior of quantum systems in normal physics .",
    "it has been argued that existence of remnants gives rise to loop divergences from the infinite number of possible objects circulating in the loop .",
    "we now see that our slicing of the traditional black hole geometry has forced us to the choose between the following possibilities :    * ( 1 ) mixed states*:the black hole evaporates away completely .",
    "the quanta @xmath74 have entanglement entropy @xmath81 .",
    "but since there is nothing left that they are entangled with , the final state is not described by any quantum wavefunction .",
    "the final state can only be described by a density matrix .    * ( 2 ) remnants*the evolution stops when @xmath82 . given the entanglement ( [ ent ] ) , we find the theory contains remnants .",
    "possibility ( 1 ) leads to a loss of unitarity of quantum mechanics , since a pure initial state evolved to a mixed final state .",
    "possibility ( 2 ) is not a violation of quantum mechanics as such , but still differs from expected physics , since normally we expect only a finite number of states if both the energy and spatial extent are bounded .",
    "the hawking argument can not say which of possibilities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) will occur since the niceness conditions @xmath73 are violated near the endpoint of evolution .",
    "thus we will lump both these possibilities into one which we call ` mixed states / remnants ' .    as mentioned at the start of this section ,",
    "the above discussion is not really the full hawking theorem yet because we have not considered possible small corrections that will in general exist to the state ( [ qtwoq3 ] ) .",
    "thus what we have seen so far is a first outline of the hawking argument . to recapitulate this outline",
    ", what we have seen is that at each stage of the evolution the entanglement entropy of the @xmath83 in this leading order state _ increases _ by @xmath84 .",
    "the evolution is very unique to the black hole because the radiation is created by the stretching of the ` middle part ' of each spacelike slice .",
    "it is the peculiar nature of the black hole geometry which creates such persistent stretching of spacelike slices .",
    "when normal hot bodies radiate , the radiation quanta are _ not _ created by stretching of spacelike slices .",
    "thus for normal hot bodies the radiation quanta depend on the nature of the atomic state at the surface of the body .",
    "by contrast , in black hole evolution we see that the matter making the hole ( @xmath18 in the above discussion ) stays far away from the place where the hawking pairs are being created .",
    "in fact with each successive stage of stretching , this matter is moved further _",
    "away _ from the place where the next pair would be produced .    how far away is this matter for the creation of the typical hawking pair for a solar mass black hole ?",

    "the number of radiation quanta is @xmath86 .",
    "thus after about half the evolution , the distance of the matter ( measured along the spacelike slice ) from the place where the pairs are being created is of order l~m ( mm_p)^2~10 ^ 77   light  years this shows the sharp contrast between the case of normal hot bodies and the case of the black hole . for normal hot bodies ,",
    "the distance @xmath10 between the matter in the body and the place where the radiation is created would be _ zero _ since the radiation leaves from the atoms in the body .",
    "one might think that even though the matter @xmath18 is very far away from where the pairs are being created , the pairs which have been created recently are close to the new pair being created , and this may help to generate correlations .",

    "the reader who wishes to get a full understanding of this point should take the full wavefunctional given in @xcite and use it to understand why the simplified state ( [ qtwoq3 ] ) gives the same essential physics of correlations as the full wavefunctional .",
    "we saw above the essence of the hawking argument : repeated stretching at the horizon leads to repeated creation of pairs in a particular entangled state ( [ qtwoq3 ] ) .",
    "this forces us to mixed states / remnants .",
    "there will of course be small corrections to the leading order state ( [ qtwoq3 ] ) .",
    "these can come from small interactions between earlier created pairs and the newly created pair .",

    "we may therefore like to argue that the niceness conditions n do not guarantee local hamiltonian evolution in gravity : we can have nonperturbative effects involving the entire region @xmath36 which will ` nonlocally ' connect physics at one point of the slice with another point of the slice .    a gravitation instanton describing the black hole has been known from early days of black hole physics : the euclidean ` cigar ' solution which has action @xmath176 .",
    "this suggests instanton effects of order e^-gm^2~e^-(mm_p)^2 [ action ] but we need corrections _ of order unity _ in the state of entangled pairs .",
    "the traditional relativist can look at the state ( [ qtwoq3 ] ) obtained in his ` nice slices evolution ' , and ask how instanton effects , continued back to lorentzian signature , change this state to a state with no entanglement between the radiation and the hole . until he is shown how such a change can happen ,",
    "he is stuck with the hawking theorem which gives mixed states / remnants at the end of evaporation .      in all our discussion of the hawking theorem",
    "we have not used the term ` information ' . even though the hawking argument is usually called the ` information paradox ' , the problem raised by his computation",
    "is not really centered on information , but rather on the mixed nature of the radiation state .",
    "in fact one can make radiation states that have full information about the hole but are still mixed ( and so violate unitarity ) , and conversely one can have the radiation state a pure unmixed state and yet carry no information about the hole .",
    "let us see this in some detail since it leads to one of the main confusions about the nature of hawking s paradox .",
    "* example 1:*suppose the matter state is @xmath177 .",
    "suppose that the process of evolution creates _ two _ @xmath178 pairs , with the full state being described as follows : ( |+|)_m&&(_m_c_1+_m_c_1)(_b_1+_b_1 ) & &  ( _ c_2_b_2+_c_2_b_2 ) note that we have made a toy model with a hypothetical evolution ; the state on the rhs is nowhere near the state we get from semiclassical evolution . with this evolution ,",
    "the first hawking quantum @xmath68 carries the full information about the initial state , so the information comes ` out ' .",
    "but there is a second quantum @xmath179 which is entangled with @xmath180 , so that the hawking radiation has entanglement entropy @xmath84 with the matter inside the hole .",
    "if the hole evaporates away then the final state of radiation will be a mixed state , and we will get loss of unitarity even though the information has been retrieved .    this toy example may appear unnatural because we let a second hawking quantum be emitted after the first one carried out all the information .",
    "but in fact the entropy of hawking radiation quanta is some @xmath181 larger than the bekenstein entropy of the hole @xcite , due to the fact that the radiation free - streams out of the hole instead of emerging quasi - statically in a reversible manner .",
    "thus the number of emitted quanta is larger than the minimum number needed to carry the information of the hole .",
    "* example 2 : * let the initial matter state @xmath177 evolve as ( |+|)_m ( _ m_c+_m_c ) ( _ b+_b ) this time the state outside ( given by the @xmath16 quantum ) is a pure state with no entanglement with the state inside the hole .",
    "but this state carries no information about the initial matter state @xmath182 , so if the black hole disappears we will be left with a pure state and yet lose information .",
    "when we burn a piece of coal we have normal quantum evolution , so the radiation is in an unmixed state and also has the information of the coal . in black hole evaporation",
    "the state ( [ qtwoq3 ] ) has _ both _ the problems of examples 1,2 : the radiation state is entangled with the state in the black hole interior , and also the radiation has only an infinitesimal amount of information about about the matter @xmath18 ( this infinitesimal amount of information arises from the small corrections of order @xmath171 that we have allowed ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that a solution to hawking s paradox will resolve both problems at the same time , but it is helpful to keep in mind the above two examples when discussing information because the terms information loss and mixed state formation are sometimes used without distinction .",
    "ads / cft @xcite duality is arguably one of the most interesting insights to emerge from string theory .",
    "it is also a very useful tool in understanding black hole behavior .",
    "but we can not simply invoke this duality to bypass the information paradox .",
    "since this is a very common confusion among students of string theory , we present it as the following discussion :    student : i do nt see why i should worry about hawking s paradox . now that we know that gravity is dual to a cft , and the cft is unitary , there can can not be any information loss , and so there is no problem .",
    "that is an entirely circular argument , as i can easily show .",
    "suppose i say : quantum mechanics is unitary , so there can be no information loss .",
    "would i have resolved hawking s paradox ?",
    "student : no , that would be silly . hawking",
    "agrees that quantum mechanics is valid in all laboratory situations .",
    "all he argues is that once we make a black hole , then quantum mechanics is violated .",
    "so we can not use our tests of quantum mechanics in the everyday world to argue that there will be no problem when black holes form .",
    "good , that is correct .",
    "so now me let me ask the same question about ads / cft .",
    "you have computed the spectrum , 2-point functions , 3 point functions etc . and found agreement between the cft and gravity descriptions .",
    "i understand that you have numerous such computations .",
    "but these processes do not involve black hole formation , and so do not address hawking s argument .",
    "is that correct ?",
    "student : yes , that is correct .",
    "but we also have a black hole solution , called ads - schwarzschild , which is similar to the metric ( [ ten ] ) in its essential respects .",
    "so i will now apply the hawking theorem , proved in the above sections , and _ prove _ that normal assumptions about locality gives mixed states / remnants . since your black hole has an ` information free horizon ' just like the schwarzschild hole , my arguments go through in exactly the same way .",
    "thus you have three choices : ( a ) you can tell me why local hamiltonian evolution breaks down under the niceness conditions",
    "n ( b ) you can agree to mixed states arising from pure states , which violates quantum theory ; in that case you lose ads / cft and string theory as well , since these are built on a foundation of usual quantum theory ( c ) you can agree to have remnants in your theory , and explain why they do not cause the problems that people feared . now",
    "which will it be ?",
    "student : i do nt know ... i see that you have forced me into a corner by using the hawking theorem , and i will have to work as hard to solve it in my ads case as i would have had to in the usual asymptotically flat case .",
    "so let me try to evade the problem by trying a different argument .",
    "i will use the cft to _ define _ my gravity theory .",
    "then i will get a gravity theory that has the expected weak field behavior , and i will never violate quantum mechanics , and i can never get information loss . excellent . with this definition of your gravity theory",
    ", you will by construction never have the ` mixed state ' possibility in hawking s theorem .",
    "so now tell me : ( a ) will you claim that traditional black holes do not form in this gravity theory ( b ) the black hole horizon forms , but the niceness conditions n do not give locality ; in this case you should be sure to tell me how this happens and what niceness conditions you will add to recover conditions for the solar system limit ( c ) do neither of the above but say that the theory has long lived remnants . student : well ... i always assumed that i could have a normal black hole horizon , usual notions of niceness conditions , and still get all the information out in hawking radiation so there are no remnants .",
    "but i see now that the hawking theorem forbids exactly this possibility .",
    "i do nt know how i can say anything about the options you list without studying the black hole formation / evaporation process in detail in either the cft or the gravity theory . exactly .",
    "you are welcome to do your analysis in either the cft or the gravity theory , but at the end you must show me what happens when a black hole forms and evaporates in the gravity description .",
    "student : i see now that to solve hawking s paradox i will have to understand the interior structure of the black hole .",
    "i can not get by with any abstract argumments like ` ads / cft removes the paradox . '",
    "exactly ; in fact abstract arguments in general can not distinguish between whether locality broke down and information came out in the hawking radiation or if information leaked out from a long lived remnant .",
    "solving the information paradox implies that you tell us which happens , and if you want the information to come out in the radiation , to show explicitly the process by which ` solar system physics ' broke down while the niceness conditions n were still valid .",
    "in recent years string theory has provided a set of results which together give a comprehensive picture of how information can come out of black holes .",
    "let us list the results first , and then discuss the qualitative picture of black hole formation and evaporation suggested by these results .",
    "\\(1 ) * fractionation:*in the early days of studying black holes in string theory it was assumed that at weak coupling we have a collection of branes , while at strong coupling we would get a black hole .",
    "this black hole was supposed to arise because the brane bound state stayed small ( planck size of string size ) while the gravitational radius became big , generating the traditional horizon around a central mass . but",
    "a closer analysis of string bound states shows that this is not the case , because of an effect termed ` fractionation ' .",
    "if we make a bound state of different kinds of branes , then the effective excitations occur in fractional units @xcite ; these are therefore light , and if we estimate the ` effective size ' of the brane bound state then it grows with the number of branes as well as with the coupling @xcite .",
    "this growth is such that the size of the brane bound state ( for the d1d5p system @xcite ) remains order horizon size at all couplings where a black hole can form .",
    "this suggests a picture where we do _ not _ get a traditional black hole because the degrees of freedom of the hole distribute themselves throughout a horizon sized ball .",
    "\\(2 ) * 2-charge microstates:*the above picture was just based on a very crude estimate , but we can now start with simple holes and start constructing all their microstates .",
    "the simplest holes are extremal 2-charge holes : the d1d5 system .",
    "entropy counts in string theory are based on using arguments that give a count in a weak coupling model , and using invariance of a supersymmetric index to argue that we have the correct count at strong coupling where a black hole is supposed to form . to solve the information paradox we need to understand the _ structure _ of the d1d5 system at at _ strong _ coupling where the black hole is supposed to form .",
    "how can we hope to do this ?",
    "first , string dualities allow us to map the d1d5 system to the ns1p system : this is just a multiwound string ( ns1 ) carrying momentum ( p ) .",
    "next , we start by looking at very simple states of this momentum carrying string .",
    "the momentum excitations are distributed like a 1-dimensional gas of excitations on the string .",
    "what if we take all the momentum to be in the lowest harmonic ?",
    "this is certainly not a generic state , but it is a convenient starting point .",
    "it is analogous to studying the problem of electromagnetic radiation in a box , where the photons can be distributed among all normal modes .",
    "if we take a state where all the photons are in the lowest mode we get a ` laser beam ' which we can describe by classical @xmath183 fields , even though the generic state of the radiation can not be so described since the fluctuation in these fields will be @xmath184 . for the string",
    "carrying momentum a similar thing happens , and the solution with all excitations in the lowest harmonic is well described by supergravity fields even at strong coupling .",
    "we can write down the solution and transform it back by dualities to the d1d5 frame .",
    "this particular state of the d1d5 system is known to have a geometry _ with no horizon and no singularity _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can now move towards more generic states : for example we can distribute the momentum among _ two _ different harmonics . in the electromagnetic radiation case",
    "we still get well defined @xmath183 fields , though the fluctuations are slightly higher than before since the occupation number in each mode is somewhat less . for our problem of the string carrying momentum ,",
    "the solution is still well described by a supergravity approximation ( though the fluctuations will be slightly higher ) ; again the solution ( mapped back to the d1d5 duality frame ) can be explicitly written down and is found to have no horizon and no singularity @xcite .",
    "an alternative description of these states can be obtained through the study of ` supertubes ' .",
    "this is interesting : when we look at these ( nongeneric ) states of the 2-charge d1d5 black hole we do not find the traditional black hole structure ; instead the structure is modified all the way to where the horizon would have been , and in fact no horizon exists .",
    "let us continue towards states that are still less generic : all we have to do is to continue distributing the momentum of the string among more and more modes till we reach the generic states described by bose and fermi distribution functions for the bosonic and fermionic excitations respectively .",
    "as we approach these generic states , we still see no formation of a horizon or singularity , but the _ fluctuations _ of the supergravity fields approach order unity . at the same time",
    "stringy corrections start appearing in the solution .",
    "first order corrections were analyzed in @xcite and interestingly , were found to be _ bounded _ ; this is significant because if a correction diverged somewhere then it could convert a smooth solution to one with a horizon or a singularity .",
    "as it is , we just get a picture of a messy , quantum ` fuzzball ' as we approach the generic solution starting from the nongeneric ones .",
    "one now finds an interesting observation : the surface area @xmath126 of this fuzzball satisfies a bekenstein type relation @xcite ~~s where @xmath185 is the bekenstein - wald entropy of the extremal hole made with @xmath186 d1 branes and @xmath187 d5 branes .",
    "\\(3 ) * 3-charge microstates:*the 2-charge hole is called the ` small black hole ' , and one might wonder if similar constructions can be extended to 3-charge and 4-charge holes , which have ` classical sized horizons ' .",
    "starting again from the nongeneric solutions and working towards less generic ones , we find a similar picture to the 2-charge case @xcite .",
    "we write down all the microstates of the 3-charge hole at weak coupling , and start by finding the gravity description of the simplest ones at strong coupling . again , instead of getting a black hole with horizon , we get a solution with no horizon and no singularity .",
    "large classes of such solutions are known now , and it is possible that there are enough to account for the entropy @xmath188 of the 3-charge strominger - vafa hole @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) * hawking radiation:*the information paradox began with the study of hawking radiation .",
    "the above results on extremal holes show that the in string theory the microstates of the hole do not have the traditional horizon structure expected from the classical geometry . but extremal holes do not radiate , and it would be more satisfactory to explicitly see the entire process by which black holes emit information carrying radiation . following the same approach as above ,",
    "we start with the simplest nonextremal microstate , and construct its geometry at strong coupling @xcite .",
    "it is found that this geometry has an ergoregion , and thus emits energy by _ ergoregion emission _ @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this emission is exactly the hawking radiation expected from this specific microstate .",
    "this agreement is very important , so let us examine it in a little more detail .",
    "the d1d5 system is described by an ` effective string ' , and the nonextremal d1d5 states carry left and right moving excitations along this effective string .",
    "collision of these excitations lead to emission of radiation , with a rate which has the following schematic form : ( ) = v()_l()_r ( ) [ gamma ] here @xmath189 is the emission vertex , @xmath190 is the occupation number of the left moving excitations and @xmath191 is the occupation number of the right moving excitations .",
    "each microstate has somewhat different @xmath192 in general , and will radiate a little differently .",
    "if we set @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the bose distribution function describing the generic excitation state for the given total energy , then it is known that @xmath195 gives the semiclassically expected hawking radiation rate from the near extremal hole @xcite .",
    "but this semiclassical computation of course gives a radiation that violates unitarity ; its only the _ rate _ of emission @xmath196 which agrees between the microscopic computation ( which is unitary ) and the gravity computation ( which is not ) .",
    "but now we are in a position go do much more : we have an explicit construction of a nonextremal microstate at strong coupling ( which is seen to have no horizon ) and have computed its emission @xmath197 in the gravity description ( which happens by ergoregion emission ) .",
    "the microscopic description of this microstate has particular values of @xmath198 ( which are very nongeneric since this microstate is very nongeneric ) .",
    "we put @xmath199 in ( [ gamma ] ) and compute the hawking radiation @xmath200 expected for this particular microstate .",
    "we find @xcite _ micro=_grav to reiterate : _ we explicitly see the hawking emission from a ( nongeneric ) microstate of the extremal hole ; we can look at this radiation and see how it carries out the information of the state .",
    "_ this imprinting of information is straightforward in this simple example : the microstate has rotation , and the spectrum of radiation depends on the size and orientation of the ergoregion inside the geometry .",
    "* lessons from the dual cft : * we should also ask what we can learn from the dual cft about dynamical black hole formation and evaporation processes . in @xcite",
    "it was found that if one uses the cft at its free orbifold point , then an interesting thing happens as we track the evolution of a particle till it crosses the position where the horizon would have been naively expected : the notion of _ where _ the particle is becomes ill defined .",
    "if we use a definition of time which is not the one at infinity , but adapted to the ` infalling frame ' , then we see no change as we cross the location where the horizon would have been , but such a time coordinate ceases to be definable after the infall time to the center of the hole .",
    "this suggests connections to the idea of ` complementarity ' , something which should be explored further .",
    "if we wish to study not a single particle infall but the collapse of an entire shell to make a black hole , then we have to do more : the free orbifold cft does not have the interactions needed to thermalize the initial state to a generic state of the hole .",
    "thus we have to use the ` deformation operator ' which take the cft away from the orbifold point and makes it interacting .",
    "this operator twists together two strands of the string , adding an insertion of the supersymmetry operator at the vertex .",
    "qualitatively , we can see that such an operator will take a pair of quanta in the cft , and upon their collision , distribute their energy over several quanta .",
    "this process will therefore take a pair of high energy excitations ( which would be created by a single high energy particle falling into the ads region of the dual geometry ) and convert them to lower and lower energy quanta , a process which looks like the thermalization of the initial quantum into a superposition of fuzzballs .",
    "one can ask when in the gravity theory there is enough energy to create a black hole ; it was found in @xcite that this energy is such that if we distribute it into lower energy quanta in the cft then these cft excitations would cover the entire ` effective string ' .",
    "thus we get a simple description of black hole formation in the dual cft : the initial excitations created by an infalling particle break up into lower energy excitations ; if this process ends before the entire effective string is covered , we do not get a black hole .",
    "( the process can end before black hole formation because we have a given length for the effective strings in the initial state , and a string of a given length @xmath10 can not support quanta of energy lower than @xmath201 . )",
    "one notes in this computation that the criterion for black hole formation depends only on the length of the components of the effective string . and not on the effective coupling .",
    "thus this thermlization process is not ` stringy ' , rather it involves multiple insertions of the gravitational interaction vertex in the gravity description .",
    "this suggests that the formation of fuzzballs happens when the large phase phase space of fuzzball solutions is explored by gravity interactions , and not by @xmath202 corrections to the metric .",
    "it may seem that such a computation in the cft using the deformation operator will be very complicated since the entire process of black hole formation will involve a large number of interactions .",
    "what helps here is that as we increase the coupling , the rate at which thermalization can take place does not keep growing : it saturates because if we wish to create quanta of energy @xmath203 from quanta of energy @xmath204 then the process will take a time at least @xmath205 because of phase space constraints .",
    "since the cft has no intrinsic length or time scale , the time for the mean energy @xmath204 of quanta to drop to say half its value must be determined by @xmath204 alone ( if it is going to remain nonzero as the effective coupling @xmath206 ) .",
    "thus we get a simple picture of the thermalization process : quanta split into other quanta as fast as they can given their wavelengths , and the energy keeps getting redistributed over more and more strands of the effective string .",
    "the interesting thing here is that _ any _ strand of the effective string can interact with _ any _ other strand , so we have a huge ( order @xmath207 ) coordination number for the interaction , unlike normal physics where a particle can only talk to a few nearest neighbours .",
    "this picture agrees with the requirement in @xcite that the thermalization be exponentially fast to save the idea of complementarity ; this is something that should be explored in more detail .",
    "* phase space : * finally , let us come to the intuitive picture of why black hole microstates can be quantum fuzzballs when the niceness conditions n required the traditional black hole with an ` information - free horizon ' .",
    "the crucial issue appears to be the analysis of _ phase space_. in the 2-charge solutions made from a string carrying momentum , we find that an interesting fact of string theory was crucial : there are no longitudinal waves on the fundamental string .",
    "thus if we try to add the second charge ( momentum ) to the first charge ( the string ) , then we necessarily have to make the string execute transverse oscillations .",
    "this is what causes the string to spread over a nontrivial transverse area , and ultimately to fill up a horizon sized region .",
    "why does the string need this much transverse space ?",
    "suppose we require the string to execute its oscillations in a much smaller transverse radius .",
    "then the momentum will have to be carried by a few high frequency modes , and there is a only a small number of such states @xcite .",
    "in general we find that if we allow too small a transverse space for the states to live in , then we can not fit in the full phase space of solutions contributing to the bekenstein entropy @xcite .",
    "phase space arguments also tell us that the infinite throat of the classical 3-charge solution will be cut off at some depth since the infinite throat is only one point in a space of ` capped throats ' @xcite . a detailed analysis of phase space measures for the 3-charge case was done in @xcite , and it was found that the throats will end at a depth expected by the microscopic analysis of states .",
    "we now have all the tools that we need to put together a logical picture of black hole formation and evaporation .",
    "suppose a shell collapses to form a black hole .",
    "the time independent states at energy @xmath23 are fuzzballs , with no horizon .",
    "let us estimate a tunneling amplitude between the shell state and any of the fuzzball states .",
    "these are both macroscopically different states , so the amplitude @xmath208 for this tunneling is very small , as was noted in ( [ action ] ) : ~e^-s_tunnel ,  s_tunnel  ~   116gr  ~   gm^2~(mm_p)^2 [ actionq ] but now comes an interesting twist : the _ number _ of fuzzball states @xmath209 that we can tunnel to is very large , being given by the bekenstein entropy ~e^s_bek~e^gm^2 thus we see that the smallness of the tunneling amplitude @xmath208 can be offset by the largeness of @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "the large entropy is of course a characteristic feature of black holes , not present in other macroscopic bodies like the sun . in any path integral we have the action , and a measure .",
    "usually the measure factor is ` small ' ( i.e. order @xmath210 ) in its effect on macroscopic processes , but the large entropy of the black hole has made its effects comparable to the effects of the classical action , and thus invalidated classical intuition .",
    "we need one last estimate before the picture is complete .",
    "tunneling is really a spreading of the wavefunction over available phase space , and we need to know that this happens in a time shorter than the hawking evaporation time ; otherwise we would not have avoided hawking s paradox and would end up with remnants . interestingly",
    ", a simple estimate of this spreading time shows that it will always be less that the hawking evaporation time @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", we have put together three things in this picture : ( a ) we have recognized that black hole microstates are fuzzballs with no traditional horizon ( b ) an estimate of the tunneling process shows that the smallness of the amplitude to tunnel to fuzzballs can be offset by the largeness of the number of states available to tunnel to ( c ) the time for this tunneling is shorter than hawking evaporation time , so the collapsing shell becomes a linear combination of fuzzball states quickly enough so that radiation can now emerge from the fuzzball rather than a traditional horizon .",
    "the first point to note about the information paradox is that it is very nontrivial : we _ can not _ preserve the standard rules for when we have nice local evolution , and still avoid hawking s puzzle .",
    "it is a common misconception that small corrections to hawking radiation , ignored in the leading order computation , will resolve the problem ; we proved explicitly in theorem 1 that such is _ not _ the case .",
    "the resolution of the puzzle is much more nontrivial and involves a deep lesson of quantum gravity : there can be such a large phase space of solutions in a given region that path integral is no longer dominated by the extremum of the classical action .",
    "put another way , the error in earlier black hole work was to assume that quantum gravity effects are always confined to within the planck distance @xmath211 . while @xmath211 is the natural length scale that we can make from @xmath212",
    ", we need a large number of quanta @xmath73 to make the black hole , and we have to then ask if quantum gravity effects stretch over distances @xmath211 or distances @xmath213 for some @xmath214 .",
    "one finds from the fuzzball computations that the latter is the case , and @xmath215 is such that the effects reach upto horizon scales .",
    "a common question is whether we can now conjecture a picture for the interior of the schwarzschild hole .",
    "let us draw our intuition from the nonextremal microstate described in the last section .",
    "the crucial point is that the geometry was independent of @xmath216 , yet we can not make a spacelike slicing that is time - independent . this is because we have an ergoreion ; the killing vector @xmath217 is timelike at infinity , _ but is not timelike everywhere .",
    "_ thus the @xmath38 surface is not spacelike everywhere .",
    "if we do try to foliate the spacetime with spacelike slices then we find that these slices ` stretch ' during the evolution , and create particles leading to particle creation by the mechanism of ergoregion emission .",
    "this emission agreed _ exactly _ with the hawking radiation expected for this microstate .",
    "we can now move towards more generic microstates , just like we did for the extremal case : we get more and more complicated ergoregions @xcite .",
    "the general classical microstate is found to always have either an ergoregion or time dependence , and so radiates energy . as we reach the generic state the scale of variation of the features in the geometry",
    "is expected to reach the planck scale , and stringy effects will give us a quantum fuzzball , just like in the extremal case .",
    "why does nt the energy of the schwarzschild hole all fall into the origin at @xmath40 ?",
    "consider the simpler case of a single string in flat space .",
    "it would seem that a string in the shape of a circle must shrink to a point under its tension so there should be no extended string states .",
    "but of course we can get extended states : the string profile is not circularly symmetric , and while each segment of the string is indeed trying to shrink , the whole exited string maintains a nonzero size in its evolution .",
    "similarly , the nonextremal microstates are not spherically symmetric , and they can not be sliced in a time independent manner .",
    "each part of the geometry is dynamical , and the whole structure maintains a nontrivial structure without generating a traditional horizon .",
    "it would be interesting to apply these lessons to cosmology .",
    "near the big bang singularity , we have a very high density of matter , and thus presumable a large available phase space of states . spreading over phase space",
    "may again make it incorrect to take any one of these states and evolve it classically .",
    "one approach to analyzing the early universe using the full entropy of states was taken in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze possible relations between the large space of bkl singularities and the possible microstates at the initial singularity ; there are strong similarities between the local behavior at the bkl singularity and the pole structure of fuzzball states .",
    "in general , it would indeed be very exciting to explore relations between black holes and the physics of the early universe .",
    "not everyone understands hawking s paradox the same way , and discussing the paradox with people having different views has helped me enormously in making this hopefully precise version of hawking s argument . in particular",
