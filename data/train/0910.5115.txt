    "* theorem 2 ) also establish a lower bound on the mean excess ; it must be of order at least @xmath2 .",
    "the primary motivation of this previous work was to gain better understanding of the behaviour of network statistics ( such as the mean excess network length ) for entirely general networks .",
    "however the appearance of poisson line processes in the upper bound result motivates a more detailed study of the `` poissonian city '' generated by a unit intensity stationary isotropic poisson line process .",
    "what can be said about the `` near - geodesics '' used to establish the upper bound ?",
    "how close are they to true geodesics ? how does random fluctuation affect excess length ? and what about traffic flow on such a network ?",
    "these questions are addressed below ; their answers require the use of lvy subordinators and self - similar markov processes ( something of a novelty in stochastic geometry ) , and a curious improper anisotropic poisson line process .",
    "previous relevant work includes : the note by @xcite , who gives a qualitative argument showing that the poisson line process provides good connections ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* satz 5 ) , who derive a result similar to the mean - excess result but concerning numbers of edges rather than length , and based on a fixed number of random lines ; and recent higher - dimensional generalizations of the rnyi - sulanke work by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also mention work by @xcite on limit distributions of shortest paths from subsidiary to major nodes in hierarchical networks based on random tessellations .",
    "finally we note the interesting work of @xcite , related to the concept of _ spanners _ from graph theory ( a geometric spanner is a planar graph connecting a set of nodes for which the graph distance between any two points is less than some fixed multiple of euclidean distance ; see for example the exposition @xcite ) .",
    "the networks constructed in @xcite are averaged rather than uniform versions of geometric spanner networks , for which the fixed multiple of euclidean distance is replaced by a logarithmic additive excess and a specific constraint is imposed on the total network length ( rather than , say , small vertex degree or total number of edges ) . in the remainder of this introductory section",
    "we introduce basic notation and concepts , and enumerate the questions which will be addressed concerning the behaviour of near - geodesics and traffic flow in the poissonian city .",
    "we begin by presenting a brief summary of stationary isotropic poisson line processes , so as to fix notation and to collect some facts about line processes which will be used below .",
    "further information can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "the ensemble of undirected lines @xmath3 in the plane may be viewed as a mbius strip of infinite width , or as a once - punctured projective plane ( since such lines can be produced as intersections of planes through the origin in @xmath4-space with the plane @xmath5 , in which case the plane through the origin and parallel to @xmath5 does not produce an intersection ) .",
    "it is often convenient to parametrize this ensemble of lines @xmath3 by representing lines using points @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the perpendicular signed distance from the line @xmath3 to a reference point , and @xmath8 is the angle that @xmath3 makes with a reference line running through the reference point . a _",
    "unit intensity stationary isotropic poisson line process _",
    "( `` poisson line process '' for short ) is determined as a poisson point process on the representing projective plane using the intensity measure @xmath9 .",
    "the factor @xmath10 ensures that the mean number of poisson lines hitting a line segment is equal to the length of the segment .",
    "slivynak s theorem on the palm distribution of a poisson process applies here : if we condition on a specific line @xmath3 belonging to the poisson line process then the residual line process is still unit intensity stationary isotropic poisson .",
    "an alternative parametrization @xmath11 , sometimes of use , employs the line angle @xmath12 as above and @xmath13 the signed distance along the reference line from the reference point to the intersection of @xmath3 with the reference line .",
    "this representation breaks down when @xmath14 ( not a major issue in the case of a poisson line process , for which the set of lines at @xmath14 has zero probability ) . in these coordinates the unit intensity measure is @xmath15 ; the sine - weighting corresponds to a length - biasing phenomenon when sampling poisson lines according to their intersections with a test line . in particular ,",
    "if two lines are conditioned to pass through a given point then they form an exchangeable pair : one having uniform direction , and the angle @xmath16 between them having density @xmath17 independent of the direction of the first .",
    "viewed as a random measure , the poisson line process generates a measure _ via _ the mean total length of lines intersected with a given set . testing against a unit disc",
    ", we can compute the resulting length intensity as @xmath18 .",
    "it follows from the above ( and in particular from slivynak s theorem ) that the point process of intersections of lines from the poisson line process has intensity @xmath18 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) .        the following caricature supplies a good intuition as to where the logarithmic excess might be located on a typical route on a network based on a poisson line process .",
    "consider a network formed between just @xmath19 nodes @xmath20 ( the source ) and @xmath21 ( the destination ) , with lines provided by a unit rate stationary isotropic poisson line process @xmath22 .",
    "let the @xmath19 nodes be separated by distance @xmath0 .",
    "we condition the line process to contain two lines @xmath23 running through source and destination nodes which are both perpendicular to the segment connecting @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( figure [ fig : caricature ] ) .",
    "we consider only those routes which involve the conditioned lines @xmath24 , respectively @xmath25 , running through @xmath20 , respectively @xmath21 , and also just one other line of the poisson line process .",
    "consider the set of lines @xmath3 which intersect both @xmath24 at distance at most @xmath26 from @xmath20 , and also @xmath25 at distance at most @xmath26 from @xmath21 .",
    "classic stochastic geometry arguments ( based on inclusion - exclusion and a special case of the `` buffon - sylvester problem''see for example @xcite ) then show that the invariant measure of this line set is given by half the difference between the summed length of the two green lines minus the summed length of the two red lines in figure [ fig : quad ] .",
    "hence the probability of _ no _ unconditioned poisson lines falling in this set is @xmath27 and as a consequence the resulting mean excess is bounded below by @xmath28 attributable to the parts of the route which lie on the conditioned lines @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "( excess along the unconditioned line @xmath3 itself is bounded above by @xmath29 and hence is negligible in the case of large @xmath0 . )",
    "this rather trivial example makes it clear that being permitted to use more than one line ( in addition to the two conditioned lines ) will reduce the excess principally by rounding off the corners at start and finish of the journey .",
    "thus it is clear ( as is indeed apparent from the computations in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) ) that the logarithmic excess in the full construction is a cost which arises entirely from the business of getting onto and off an efficient route between source and destination .",
    "any two specified points @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the plane will almost surely not be hit by any of the lines of a given isotropic stationary poisson line process @xmath22 , and therefore will fail to be connected by @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly we establish the convention that movement from @xmath20 to @xmath21 occurs as follows : first use the poisson tessellation to construct the cell @xmath30 containing @xmath20 and @xmath21 which arises by deleting all poisson lines which separate @xmath20 from @xmath21 .",
    "now proceed from the source @xmath20 in exactly the opposite direction to that of @xmath21 , till one first encounters a poisson line ( which will be part of the cell boundary @xmath31 ) .",
    "then continue along the line in one or the other direction , clockwise or anti - clockwise , proceeding along the boundary of the cell @xmath32 .",
    "continue until one reaches the ray extending from @xmath20 and through @xmath21 .",
    "then proceed down this ray to the destination @xmath21 ( figure [ fig : construction ] ) .",
    "thus we consider _ near - geodesics _ ; routes based on _ semi - perimeters _ of the cell @xmath32 .",
    "evidently this is a conservative option for plumbing nodes in to the poisson network produced by @xmath22 , suitable if we wish to produce upper bounds on connection lengths and adopted without further comment in what follows .",
    "we suppose the choice of whether to travel clockwise or anti - clockwise round the cell @xmath30 , ( equivalently , which semi - perimeter to choose ) is made at random and equiprobably , independently for each pair of nodes @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "( as mentioned in section [ sec : conclusion ] , interesting and hard problems arise if the choice of route for a specific pair is influenced by the flow in the entire network . )    in contrast to true geodesic connections , these routes can be viewed as outputs from an unsophisticated but direct _ semi - perimeter algorithm _ :",
    "if one is on a poisson line and encounters another poisson line then one chooses ( from the three onward paths ) that path which leads closest to the eventual destination _ without overshoot_. this focuses attention on the _ poissonian city _ , a region connected by routes based on a fixed stationary isotropic poisson line process and following the above convention so as to ensure that the line process actually connects nodes .",
    "questions addressed in section [ sec : geodesics ] of this paper , filling in and extending the results announced in @xcite , include :    1 .",
    "what can one say about the basic geometry of these routes ?",
    "computations from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) yield @xmath33 as asymptotic mean excess length as @xmath34 tends to infinity .",
    "this can be viewed as a quantitative development of the announcement by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we have established that one can produce a coupling construction to show that @xmath418 converges almost surely and indeed in mean value to the corresponding quantity for the improper stationary anisotropic line process .",
    "in fact it is possible to establish convergence of moments of order @xmath419 for @xmath420 ; computations show that the second moment @xmath421}$ ] is bounded by @xmath422 hence a uniform integrability argument may be applied .",
    "the tiresomely complicated computations are omitted ; we simply indicate the general approach .",

    "analysis of this eight - fold integral is complicated because the probability @xmath429}\\ ] ] takes on around eight different analytical forms according to the relative geometry of the line segments .",
    "case - by - case mathematical analysis shows that the multiple integral is bounded by @xmath422 .",
    "it is natural to ask how the poissonian city might compare with an alternate manhattan city based on a more conventional cartesian grid structure of roads ( a `` grid city '' ) .",
    "consider the case of a disc of radius @xmath0 furnished with roads arranged in a fixed unit - length grid structure .",
    "suppose we wish to connect from the point at @xmath430 to the point at @xmath70 ( using cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "if @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath13 , and @xmath82 are all non - negative then there are a wide variety of possible geodesic connections . working with the most direct analogy to the results described in section [ sec : flow ] , suppose that traffic from @xmath430 to @xmath70 divides equally between the two extreme geodesics running from @xmath430 to @xmath70 .",
    "working to @xmath431 ( allowing us to ignore some double - counting ) , the total traffic through @xmath36 is made up of four contributions , arising from ( i ) @xmath432 , ( ii ) @xmath433 , ( iii ) @xmath434 , ( iv ) @xmath435 .",
    "each case individually contributes a term of the form @xmath436 where we omit the negligible contributions arising when there is just one geodesic between source and destination .",
    "we can sum these contributions , since the effect of double - counting is again negligible .",
    "thus the total flow through @xmath36 is @xmath437 .",
    "if we fix attention on total flow through one of the bonds attached to @xmath36 ( so as to establish comparability with the results of section [ sec : first - order ] for the poissonian city ) then we obtain @xmath438 , compared with mean flow for the poissonian city of @xmath439 .",
    "however account needs to be taken of the greater total length of the grid network .",
    "mean total network length produced by the unit intensity poisson line process is @xmath440 , compared with @xmath441 for the unit grid structure .",
    "thus a comparable grid structure has to be based on segments of length @xmath442 rather than @xmath192 .",
    "the flow produced through a bond attached to @xmath36 by such a grid using the above protocol will be of order @xmath443 where the second term computes the flow through a centre bond when re - scaling from @xmath0 to @xmath444 , and the first factor is a correction to ensure that total traffic is @xmath445 not @xmath446 .",
    "thus the poissonian city is comparable to this grid structure in terms of mean flow at the centre . however the grid structure with this protocol can be shown to have the undesirable feature that asymptotically a definite proportion of the total traffic ( around 2% ) occurs _ outside _ the disk .",
    "in fact one can also carry out calculations for a somewhat more demanding situation in which asymptotically the traffic stays within the disk as in the case of the poissonian city ; instead of supposing the traffic is divided equally between the two extreme geodesics , we suppose that it is divided equally amongst all possible geodesic connections . in effect , the actual geodesic is chosen uniformly at random , and in that case the probability that the resulting geodesic passes through the origin @xmath447 is @xmath448 } { \\operatorname{\\mathbb{p}}\\left[\\operatorname{bin}(x+y , p)=x\\right ] } } { { \\operatorname{\\mathbb{p}}\\left[\\operatorname{bin}(u+v+x+y , p)=u+x\\right ] } } \\quad=\\quad \\frac{\\binom{u+v}{u}\\binom{x+y}{x}}{\\binom{u+v+x+y}{u+x}}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath449 , but in fact the same result is obtained for any @xmath450 . choosing @xmath451",
    "so as to control the denominator , and applying stirling s formula , we can use taylor expansion to approximate this by @xmath452 using polar coordinates based on an axis at @xmath453 to the cartesian axes , and a gaussian approximation based on @xmath454 , we obtain a heuristic approximation for large @xmath0 for the flow between two opposing quadrants of the disc : @xmath455 conversion of this approach into a rigorous asymptotic argument would require close attention to detailed asymptotics of the binomial distribution @xcite .",
    "however there is an alternate argument which is more easily made rigorous : the expression can be re - expressed in terms of a symmetric random walk @xmath106 as @xmath456}\\,.\\ ] ] under the @xmath457-action @xmath458 , a statistical pivot argument applied to the summand generates a probability distribution on even integers or odd integers according to the parity of @xmath459 , @xmath460 .",
    "an argument using the hoeffding inequality quantifies how this probability distribution concentrates around its mode ; the denominator is controlled by choosing the probability @xmath461}=p=\\tfrac{u+x}{u+v+x+y}$ ] .",
    "thus it can be shown that the asymptotic behaviour of the quadruple sum is given by the number of @xmath457-orbits containing modal representatives close to the line between @xmath430 and @xmath70 .",
    "this number can be expressed as a sum susceptible to elementary asymptotic analysis , finally yielding a rigorous argument for the asymptotic given in .",
    "consider now the total flow through a unit - length bond @xmath3 connected to the origin .",
    "this will equal half the total flow through the origin , which itself can be viewed asymptotically as the sum of two equal components from two different pairs of opposing quadrants .",
    "thus this total flow is again asymptotic to @xmath439 .    again",
    "a grid structure comparable to the poissonian city must be based on segments of length @xmath442 rather than @xmath192 , and",
    "a scaling argument then shows that such a grid structure produces mean flow at the centre which is asymptotic to @xmath462 .",
    "thus traffic through the centre under this protocol is about @xmath463 higher in a comparable manhattan city .",
    "geodesics in the manhattan city are on average longer than those in the poisson line process ; we can in fact argue in a manner analogous to that of section [ sec : location - dependence ] to show that mean network distance between two independent uniformly random points in the disk will be asymptotic to @xmath464 so the mean network flow over the whole disk for the grid will again be about 25% greater than mean network flow for the poisson line process .",
    "of course the second - order behaviours of the flows are rather different : flow at the centre of the poissonian city inherits asymptotically non - degenerate randomness from the random configuration of the poisson line process , while a central limit argument shows that the flows at the centres of the two kinds of flow in manhattan cities are asymptotically deterministic .",
    "in conclusion we present some notes about complements and issues for further research , illustrating the potentially rich theory concerning the poissonian city .",
    "clearly the poissonian city does not accurately represent real cities ; there will be variation both of geometry and of traffic flow",
    ". it would be interesting to make empirical comparisons with actual street - map and traffic - flow data , both in terms of network distance statistics compared with the results of section [ sec : connections ] and ( much more demanding from a data - collection point of view ) in terms of flow statistics compared with the results of section [ sec : flow ] .",
    "one would expect qualitative agreement at best , rather than quantitative , in view of the strong stochastic assumptions implicit in the poissonian city .",
    "note however that the results on the asymptotic statistics of flow at the centre ( theorem [ thm : scaling - limit ] ) reflect variation across a sample of different cities , rather than within a particular city .",
    "compare the lower bound of section [ sec : true - geodesics ] , theorem [ thm : poisson - lower - bound ] , with the more general lower bound of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) , which holds for all connecting networks using total network length proportional to @xmath0 based on patterns of nodes in a square @xmath465 ^ 2 $ ] satisfying a certain quantitative equidistribution condition ( related to an intuitive coupling construction ) .",
    "the @xcite result provides an @xmath2 bound on excess , whereas theorem [ thm : poisson - lower - bound ] uses detailed properties of poisson line process networks to establish a @xmath466 lower bound .",
    "a natural question is , whether there are any network constructions which provide sub - logarithmic mean excess for appropriately equidistributed patterns of nodes , or whether on the other hand the general lower bound can be improved .",
    "the stochastic geometric construction of the limit distribution for flow in the centre of a poissonian city using an improper stationary anisotropic poisson line process ( section [ sec : limiting - object ] ) is explicit and lends itself to simulation ; however it would be helpful also to have an analytic expression or at least characterization of the limiting distribution .",
    "this seems difficult .",
    "note that we can produce a stochastic representation of the moment generating function @xmath467 of the limit distribution in terms of the following probability : consider a poisson process of intensity @xmath68 of _ pairs _ of points on @xmath468\\times(0,\\infty)$ ] : then @xmath469 is the probability that no pairs produced by this process are separated from the origin by lines of the improper stationary anisotropic poisson line process .",
    "similar representations are of use in perfect simulation of area - interaction point process models @xcite and exact simulation of diffusions @xcite .",
    "however in the current case it is not yet clear whether this offers any progress towards simulation methods or delivering a useful analytical representation .",
    "a slightly easier question is whether the convergence of @xmath44 to the limit distribution holds for all moments .",
    "again , at present no progress on this can be offered beyond the work noted in section [ sec : uniform - integrability ] .",
    "what can we say about similar situations where the distribution of nodes generating the flow is non - uniform ? or even when the nodes generating the flows lie along the poisson line process itself ?",
    "( thus precluding the need for the `` cross - country '' plumbing otherwise required to get onto the network . )",
    "considerations of this kind are latent in the early work of @xcite , and it would be interesting to see them applied in the more quantitative setting of the present work .",
    "it is possible that the coupling construction in @xcite would be of use here .      in higher dimensions one needs to consider what kind of network is being deployed .",
    "one might for example consider the edge process of a poisson hyperplane tessellation , or alternatively one might consider geodesics constrained to lie on the union of all faces of the tessellation . in the second case one can derive upper bounds on excess by considering the derivative planar problem obtained by taking a @xmath19-plane slice through the source and destination nodes ; it is then a question how much the excess may be reduced by varying the orientation of the slice , and it is a further question whether the excess can be further substantially reduced by using paths which do not lie wholly on the slicing plane . it may be possible to make progress in the first case by adopting the growth process approach of section [ sec : growth ] .",
    "note that @xcite describe higher - dimensional results for similar problems ; however their results concern standard stereological quantities , while we would need results involving infima of lengths of regular curves on the boundaries of poisson cells .",
    "certainly one can conceive of results for situations based on processes which approximate poisson line processes ; boolean models based on long line segments , or fibre processes for which there is strong control of total fibre curvature",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to determine the extent to which poissonian cities and manhattan cities represent two extremes of a suitable class of models .",
    "the notion of ue ( user - equilibrium @xcite , contemporary with the related notion of nash equilibrium ) supposes that each user has a utility structure for choosing which route they might take based on travel time , which is affected only on available route - lengths but also on flow along the routes .",
    "interest is then focused on systems of choices by users which result in user equilibrium ; no one user can obtain a shorter route by varying their own route .",
    "explorations have already been made in the context of queueing theory : see for example @xcite , who consider the effect of augmenting a simple queueing network and @xcite , who consider a system of interactions between a @xmath470 queue and a @xmath471 batch queue .",
    "there are interesting possibilities in the context of the poissonian city , for example considering that traffic from @xmath20 to @xmath21 chooses each of the two possible routes prescribed by the semi - perimeter algorithm according to considerations both of length and of integrated total flow along the routes .",
    "such problems are naturally formulated in terms of phase transitions in statistical mechanics , perhaps using the improper stationary anisotropic poisson line process of section [ sec : limiting - object ] .",
