    "two basic forms of the interaction potential chosen for the analysis in the present work are specified below .    as mentioned above , the attractive potential  ( [ pot ] ) is a peculiar one , as it scales with distance @xmath25 in exactly the same way as the laplacian operator of the kinetic energy ; as a result , the free - particle problem , with @xmath26 , has no intrinsic length scale . in other words , the system s properties scale , following variation of the particle density , making phase transitions impossible .",
    "this feature is in a stark contrast with the usual situation , where a phase transition may be reached by altering the density .",

    "here we address the problem of stability of the many - body system within the framework of the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "this method is commonly applied to many - body systems in the presence of an external potential , when the chemical potential of the homogeneous system is known .",

    "the density at the center features an integrable divergency reflecting the presence of the attractive central potential .",

    "we are interested to find the _ release energy _ , which remains in the system when the harmonic trapping is suddenly switched off , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 stands for the average value .",
    "it is especially important to find out if @xmath75 is positive or negative .    in the limit of the vanishing central potential , @xmath76 , the size of the cloud",
    "is defined by the balance between the chemical potential ( which depends on the particle - particle interaction strength ) and the harmonic confinement  @xcite , @xmath77 .",
    "the respective chemical potential , @xmath78 , is always positive , hence the respective release energy , @xmath79 , is positive too .    in the opposite limit of strong attraction to the center ,",

    ", the system s energy diverges for on the lower integration bound corresponding to small system s sizes , @xmath82 .",
    "thus we conclude , that , in the framework of the lda , the collapse is always possible , as far as the energy is considered .",
    "it is important to note that the kinetic energy , which is a key ingredient precluding the onset of the collapse , is not fully taken into account by the lda . a more complete mean - field gross - pitaevskii theory , which takes into account the kinetic energy properly , predicts the suppression of the collapse @xcite .",
    "thus , it is obviously interesting to see how beyond - mean - field effects modify that result .",
    "in the single - particle problem , the collapsed state results in a density profile which is a delta - function at the center , @xmath83 . then , two essential questions arise : ( i ) whether a similar singular state , @xmath84 , corresponds to the gs of a many - body system containing @xmath19 particles ; and ( ii ) if a nonsingular gaseous state may be metastable , i.e. , dynamically stable against small perturbations , even if the gs corresponds to the collapse .",

    "any soft - core potential is not sufficient to prevent the system from the transition to the collapsed gs ( fall onto the center ) . on the other hand , for physically realistic interparticle potentials with a hard core ( for example , of the van der waals type ) , with @xmath89 , the fully - collapsed state , with @xmath84 , would lead to a diverging positive contribution to the energy , which may prevent this state from being the gs .",
    "the answer to question ( ii ) depends on the number of particles , @xmath19 , and parameters of the interaction .",
    "it may happen that , while the gs corresponds to the fall onto the center , there is a barrier between the collapsed and nonsingular gaseous states , making the latter one metastable .",
    "indeed , the interparticle - interaction energy , @xmath90 , depends quadratically on @xmath19 , while the energy of the attraction to the central potential scales linearly with @xmath19 , which suggests that the systems may effectively stabilize itself for @xmath19 large enough .    to study the expected scenarios for the soft- and hard - core potentials , we consider two respective models for @xmath24 : the hard - sphere potential of diameter @xmath91 , @xmath92 and its soft - sphere counterpart , @xmath93 with finite @xmath85 in the latter case .",

    "( [ eq : en ] ) , where the contribution due to the repulsive interactions scales as @xmath27 for large @xmath19 , while the term corresponding the attractive central potential scales as @xmath19 .",
    "the energy barrier between the state described by ansatz  ( [ eq : f1 ] ) and the free state with zero energy , @xmath143 , is estimated as the maximum value of the energy per particle ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for a large system size",
    ", the barrier can be approximated by comparing the two basic energy scales given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e : c ] ) and  ( [ eq : en ] ) .",
    "this resulting asymptotic approximation is @xmath144 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by the dashed line .     and @xmath145 as a function of the number of particles , @xmath19 , for the data shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the dashed line depicts the asymptotic approximation  ( [ large ] ) for the large system . ]",
    "this work is stimulated by the recent results showing that , in the framework of the mfa ( mean - field approximation ) , the quantum collapse ( alias fall onto the center ) of bosons pulled by 3d attractive potential  ( [ pot ] ) can be suppressed by the repulsive collisional nonlinearity in the ultracold bosonic gas , which is described by the gpe ( gross - pitaevskii equation )  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the collapsing gs ( ground state ) is replaced by a regular one with a finite density . here , going beyond the framework of the mfa ,",
    "we demonstrate that this prediction finds its counterpart in the many - body system governed by the same hamiltonian : while the collapse is still possible in the system , the repulsive interactions create a non - singular metastable gaseous state , which is isolated from the collapsing one by a tall potential barrier .",
    "the metastability quickly enhances with the increase of the number of bosons , @xmath19 , starting from @xmath121 , in agreement with the expectation that the mfa should be valid for @xmath19 large enough . in the same time , the absolute stability threshold remains the same , in terms of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , @xmath12 , as for the single particle  @xcite .",
    "the results have been obtained through calculations of the variational energy , implemented by means of the monte carlo technique .",
    "the analysis reported here may be naturally expanded in other directions . in particular",
    ", it may be possible to construct stabilized states carrying the angular momentum , i.e. , counterparts of vortical modes , predicted in ref .",

    "further , following the mfa results for the 2d geometry reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , it may be interesting to consider the many - body system in the 2d setting .",
    "the conclusion that only the quintic term may suppress the quantum collapse in that case , suggests that the stabilization of the 2d state may demand adding three - body interactions to the many - particle hamiltonian .",
    "lastly , a challenging problem is to explore a similar possibility for fermions pulled to the center by potential  ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the simplest approach may then be to consider a balanced fermi gas , with repulsive interactions between equal numbers of spin - up and spin - down particles  @xcite .",
