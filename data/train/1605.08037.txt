    "w43-mm1 is a large and young high mass star forming clump located within the w43 region and at 5.5 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "the clump is near @xmath0 and at an interface with an extended  region powered by a cluster of o type and wolf - rayet stars . @xcite .",
    "w43-mm1 has been well studied in continuum from 1.3 mm to 70 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "these studies identified a large sample of clumps in w43 , from which w43-mm1 is the most massive with an estimated mass of 2128  and a deconvolved size of 0.09 pc @xcite .",
    "infalling motions have been detected towards w43-mm1 @xcite suggesting that the clump is undergoing gravitational collapse .",
    "@xcite made interferometric observations of polarized dust emission with bima , finding an ordered pattern for the magnetic field and estimating an on - the - plane of the sky field strength of about 1 mg .",
    "recent sma results from polarized dust emission and ch@xmath2cn line emission at higher angular resolution ( @xmath3 pc scales ) updated the magnetic field estimate to 6 mg also computing a mass to magnetic flux ratio of about the critical value @xcite . additionally from the ch@xmath2cn emission , evidence for an embedded hot core of @xmath4 k was found in w43-mm1 main clump . in this letter",
    "we report the first alma observations of polarized dust emission towards w43-mm1 . here , section [ se : obs ] report the observations , section [ se : ce ] the continuum emission and source extraction , section [ se : mf ] the magnetic field properties , and section [ se : sum ] is the summary and discussion .",
    "alma observations at 1 mm ( band 6 ) were done on may 30th , 2015 over w43-mm1 using @xmath518:47:47.0 and @xmath6 - 01:54:28.0 as phase center .",
    "an array of 35 antennas was used reaching an angular resolution of 0.5@xmath7 ( @xmath8 0.01 pc scales ) .",
    "the spectral configuration was set to single spectral windows per baseband in continuum mode with 64 channels giving 31.250 mhz as the spectral resolution in full polarization mode ( @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) .",
    "each spectral window was centered at the standard alma band 6 polarization frequencies ( 224.884 , 226.884 , 238.915 , and 240.915 ghz ) , where two successful executions were done as part of the session scheme @xcite .",
    "calibration and imaging was done using the common astronomical software applications ( casa ) version 4.5 .",
    "the alma antennas are equipped with receivers sensitive to linear polarization .",
    "after the incoming radiation has gone through the feed - horn , the wave is divided into two orthogonal components ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) by a wave splitting device @xcite .",
    "this operation is not perfect and there is always a residual , or projection , from one polarization onto the other which is known as the instrumental polarization , or d - terms @xcite . given that an antenna uses azimuth and elevation coordinates , the frame of the sky rotates with respect to the antenna introducing an angular dependence which is parameterized by the parallactic angle .",
    "additionally to the d - terms , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 polarizations have different signal paths which introduces a relative delay between both polarizations .",
    "also , the interferometric calibration scheme for amplitude and phase requires the use of a reference .",
    "this reference breaks the degeneracy intrinsic to the array and thus ; we do not measure absolute phase values but relative ones with respect to the reference ( where phases are set to zero in both polarizations ) . by doing this ,",
    "we introduce an additional phase bandpass between the _ xy _ and _ yx _ cross correlations . to calibrate all these quantities",
    ", an alma polarization observation samples a strong , un - resolved , polarized source over a certain range of parallactic angle .",
    "the polarization calibrator is sampled for 5 minutes every 35 minutes or so ( the precise time cadence is calculated by the online software at run time ) . for our observations , we obtained about 100@xmath13 of parallactic angle coverage for j1924 - 292 which was selected as polarization calibrator . using this source , we derived solutions for the cross polarization delay , the _",
    "xy_-phase , and the d - terms .",
    "these solutions were applied to w43-mm1 data also using j1751 + 0939 to calibrate the bandpass , j1851 + 0035 to calibrate the phase , and titan to calibrate the flux . after applying the calibration tables , we imaged the data using the @xmath14 casa task with the _ briggs _ weighting scheme , robust number 0.5 , for sidelobe robustness and the clark deconvolution algorithm to produce the stokes images .",
    "the final images were produced after three self - calibration iterations using a final solution interval of 90 seconds .",
    "figure [ stokesi ] presents the stokes i image from w43-mm1 .",
    "the continuum emission shows a fragmented filament extending from the north to the south - west .",
    "two bright sources at the center , a and b1 , completely dominate the energy budget in w43-mm1 ( with integrated fluxes of @xmath8 2.0 and 0.5 jy , which correspond to @xmath15 of the total flux recovered ) , over a number of additional fragments extending to the south - west . also , additional sources to the east and west have been detected . comparing with the sma results from @xcite and the pdbi 1 mm results from @xcite ,",
    "the alma observations reproduce quite well the overall morphology of w43-mm1 , but with better resolution .",
    "the noise in the alma map is @xmath16 mjy @xmath17 with a peak of 503 mjy @xmath17 obtained from gaussian fitting .",
    "we used the _ getsources _ algorithm @xcite to successfully extract 14 sources from our alma data ( see table [ tab1 ] and figure [ stokesi ] ) .",
    "the extraction was later compared to other methods such as _ clumpfind _",
    "@xcite , _ fellwalker _ , and _ reinhold _",
    "@xcite obtaining a good agreement with the selection produced by _",
    "getsources_. we used the source positions and sizes derived using _ getsources _ as initial guess for a gaussian 2-d fitting ( using casa _ imfit _",
    "algorithm ) in order to derived accurate fluxes from the extracted sources .",
    "also , we kept the same source nomenclature used by @xcite , but adding numbers where higher multiplicity was discovered with respect to the sma map . using the standard procedure to calculate masses from dust emission",
    "@xcite we computed masses for all 15 sources in our catalog assuming a dust opacity of @xmath18 @xmath19g@xmath20 @xcite , a gas to dust ratio of 1:100 , and a dust temperature of @xmath21 k @xcite , with the exception of the hot core , source a , where we used a range between @xmath22 k. although the sma detected ch@xmath2cn emission towards b1 and c , it was unresolved and not sufficient to derived temperatures ; hence , we used @xmath21 k for these sources .",
    "@xcite modeled an sed and derived a temperature profile for source a using all the publicly available data on w43-mm1 to date .",
    "their model suggests a temperature of @xmath8 150 k at 2500 au distance ( 0.5@xmath7 radial ; 1@xmath7 size ) and @xmath23 k at about 8000 au distance ( 0.7@xmath7 radial ; 1.4@xmath7 size ) , which are the length - scales sampled by alma .",
    "however if larger spatial scales than our source size are considered , the temperature might be lower and in the order of 30 k ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "these scales ( @xmath24 ) are consistent with herschel primary beam at 160 @xmath1 m and , off course , larger than our deconvolved source sizes and synthesized beam . therefore and using this temperature range ,",
    "our derived mass for source a is between 312 and 146   ( with the exception of the 30 k temperature derived mass of 728  ) .",
    "these estimates put source a below other massive clumps such as the sdc335-mm1 mass estimate of 545   @xcite and g31.41 + 0.31 with a mass estimate of 577   @xcite)=@xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "however , these mass estimates where derived from observations sampling larger length scales than our alma w43 observations . the deconvolved size of sdc335-mm1 is about 0.054 which is 2 times the size of source a or 4 times the area",
    ". a simple estimate assuming a @xmath27 density profile , will give about 272  per source a size for sdc335-mm1 and about 205  per source a size for g31.41 + 0.31 .",
    "the polarized emission from w43-mm1 shows fractional polarization levels between 0.03% to 22% where the lowest values are seen over the peaks in stokes i , which corresponds to the well known polarization - hole ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . assuming perfect grain alignment , the magnetic field morphology onto the plane of the sky is inferred from the polarized emission by rotating the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) by 90@xmath13 and shown in figure [ w43_pol ] .",
    "the field morphology shows a smooth and ordered pattern over the filament on angular scales @xmath28 , .",
    "however , recent results from alma commissioning @xcite showed that the systematic error within -3 db level ( @xmath29 ) of the primary beam is less than 0.5% in band 6 , which is larger than the size of the w43-mm1 filament .",
    "in fact , our observations are consistent to the sma data beyond the 1/3 of fwhm or 10@xmath7 limit . ] where ordered magnetic fields are found in massive dense cores when observed at similar spatial scales , as it has been shown from a relatively large sample by @xcite .",
    "we found overall agreement with the sma results , but now given our higher resolution and sensitivity , we can see the field morphology in greater detail .",
    "in fact for source a , there is a @xmath890@xmath13 change in orientation to the west of the clump , where there is also a decrease in polarized intensity , and towards d1 , the field changes about @xmath30 in orientation with respect to the main filament . for analysis",
    ", we divided the filament into four regions according to the boundaries in the field pattern .",
    "although , the field morphology is continuous from a to b1 , we set the boundary to the north of b2 where we plotted the lowest contour in the polarized intensity .",
    "we did that in order to analyze the field locally to source a and sources b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , and e.    to understand the dynamical importance of the magnetic field over w43-mm1 , we estimated the strength of the field using the chandrasekhar & fermi technique ( here after cf * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as follows from @xcite .",
    "@xmath31    where @xmath32 is the molecular hydrogen number density calculated as an average over the region sampled by the polarized dust emission , @xmath33 is the fwhm from a line tracing the gas motions in w43 which in this case was taken to be 3.0 km / s from h@xmath34co@xmath35(4 - 3 ) and dco@xmath35(5 - 4 ) single dish emission @xcite , and @xmath36 is the evpa dispersion , which we calculated as the standard deviation of the evpas for each region .",
    "thus , the derived field strengths are local to all the sources in a particular region .",
    "table [ tab2 ] summarizes our polarization results with the corresponding estimations for the field .",
    "the usage of the cf method have been debated given the small angle dispersion approximation required and the assumption of energy equipartition . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] we see that 2 out of 4 of our regions have evpa dispersions larger than the @xmath37 limit suggested by @xcite .",
    "given this , we included modified versions of the cf method @xcite , to calculate the field strength on each region independently .",
    "@xcite attempt to address the limitation of the small angle approximation by replacing @xmath38 by @xmath39 which is calculated locally and by adding a geometric correction to avoid underestimating the field in the super - alfvenic case .",
    "in contrast , @xcite assumed that the field perturbation is a global property and thus , they replaced @xmath36 by @xmath40 in the denominator of equation [ cf ] . by using the 3 versions of the cf method",
    ", we obtained estimations of the magnetic field between 0.2 to 7 mg for our 4 regions , where for source a we obtained values between 1 and 4 mg .",
    "@xcite plotted the most up - to - date field profile from zeeman measurements .",
    "figures 6 and 7 in that work , suggests that our estimates for b@xmath41 are consistent with the curve if we extrapolate the profile as , unfortunately , the plot lacks field values for the @xmath42 @xmath43 range in column density .",
    "the alma results on w43_mm1 suggest that we are seeing a highly fragmented filament where the emission is dominated by a single clump , source a. indeed , from table [ tab1 ] we see that the bulk of fragments ( 13 ) have fluxes between 32 and 200 mjy ; while source a alone is about 2 jy . the high degree of fragmentation seen in the alma data pose the question about the gravitational stability of these sources .",
    "although we do not have high resolution line data to address the kinematics and determine if these sources are self - gravitating , the infalling motions detected by @xcite ( covering an area of @xmath44 ) are likely showing accretion from larger scales onto the whole filament and suggesting gravitational collapse . to test the gravitational stability of each fragment , we calculated the thermal jeans length as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 the sound speed , @xmath47 is the volume density , and @xmath48 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we found that our deconvolved sizes are larger than the estimated jeans lengths by roughly an order of magnitude for most fragments .",
    "thus , we can not conclude what fraction of these fragments are gravitationally unstable from these data alone .",
    "interestingly is the case of source a which has been determined to be gravitationally bound ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) but its deconvolved size is between a factor of 10 and 6 larger than its jeans length . if the jeans length suggests further fragmentation , it is possible that source a has a larger multiplicity of fragments which requires higher angular resolution to resolve .        where n@xmath50 is molecular hydrogen column density in @xmath43 calculated for each source independently , b@xmath41 is the magnetic field strength in @xmath51 assumed to be unique for a given region , and factor of 3 in the denominator corresponds to an statistical geometrical correction @xcite .",
    "this statistical geometrical factor of 3 is for a uniform density slab and will be smaller than 3 for more physically realistic cases , such as a centrally condensed disk .",
    "we found highly super - critical values for all fragments in the filament ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , showing that the field is not strong enough to support them against gravity . also , it is worth noting that polarized emission decreases significantly towards the dust peaks in w43-mm1 , which has already been observed towards dr21(oh ) by the sma @xcite .",
    "this is particularly evident towards source a where the polarized intensity emission goes below the 5@xmath52 level close the dust peak .",
    "additionally , the b@xmath41 morphology in source a seems to indicate the field weakness as the lines appear to be bent towards the dust peak .",
    "this additional evidence , suggests that gravity is pulling the field lines as the gas is infalling due to gravitational collapse .",
    "however , what fraction of these fragments are bound by gravity is still open ; and thus , further fragmentation can not be ruled out .    here , we have presented alma polarized dust emission observations of w43-mm1 .",
    "we have found a fragmented filament threaded by a smooth , ordered , and highly detailed magnetic field .",
    "we have derived mass estimates for 15 fragments extracted from the continuum map , showing that source a dominates the flux distribution with a 51% of the total flux .",
    "using temperature modeling by others , we derived a mass range for source a between 146 and 312  under the length - scales sampled by alma .",
    "however , it is not clear if further fragmentation is ongoing inside source a and only higher resolution alma observations can reveal this .",
    "we have derived magnetic field strengths for all fragments with sufficient polarization data and found field estimations in range of 0.2 - 7 mg using 3 versions of the cf method .",
    "derivation of the mass to magnetic flux ratio indicate that the fragments are super - critical suggesting that the field is dominated by gravity at this stage of the w43-mm1 evolution .    .",
    "overlaid are the sources extracted as ellipses , in black , representing the deconvolved sized obtained from the gaussian fits . with an rms noise of @xmath53 mjy @xmath17 ,",
    "the dynamic range of the self - calibrated image is 1220 . ]    . the magnetic field morphology is shows as pseudo - vectors at a significance of 3@xmath52 in green and 5@xmath52 in blue , where @xmath54jy @xmath17 corresponds to the noise in the polarized intensity image .",
    "the length of each pseudo - vectors is normalized .",
    "also , each pseudo - vector is plotted every half - beam , i.e. in steps of 8 and 4 pixels , where the beam is @xmath55 pixels . ]",
