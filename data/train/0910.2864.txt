    "recently , we have obtained a suitable extension of the canonical fluctuation - dissipation relation involving the heat capacity @xmath1 and energy fluctuations @xcite : @xmath3which considers a _ system - surroundings _ equilibrium situation in which the inverse temperature @xmath4 of a given thermostat exhibits non - vanishing correlated fluctuations with the total energy @xmath5 of the system under study as a consequence of the underlying thermodynamic interaction , @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , eq.([fdr ] ) differs from the canonical equilibrium situation due to the realistic possibility that the internal thermodynamical state of the thermostat can be affected by the presence of the system under study .",
    "this allows us to describe the fluctuating behavior of the system under more general equilibrium situations , rather than the ones associated with the known canonical and microcanonical ensembles .",
    "the fluctuation relation ( [ fdr ] ) possesses interesting connections with some challenging problems related to statistical mechanics , such as : ( 1 ) a compatibility with the existence of macrostates exhibiting _ negative heat capacities _",
    "@xmath2 @xcite , a thermodynamic anomaly that appears in many physical contexts ( ranging from small nuclear , atomic and molecular clusters @xcite to the astrophysical systems lynden , lyn2,thir , einarsson ) associated with the existence of _  nonextensive properties _",
    "@xcite ; ( 2 ) a direct application for the extension of available monte carlo methods based on the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble in order to capture the presence of a regime with @xmath2 and avoid the incidence of the so - called _ super - critical slowing down _",
    "@xcite ( a dynamical anomaly associated with the occurrence of discontinuous ( first - order ) phase transitions @xcite , which significantly reduces the efficiency of monte carlo methods @xcite ) ; ( 3 ) finally , a direct relationship with an _ uncertainty relation _ supporting the existence of some _ complementary character _ between thermodynamic quantities of energy and temperature @xcite , an idea previously postulated by bohr and heisenberg @xcite with a long history in the literature @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to present a more complete study of the existing connections of the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdr ] ) .",
    "the core of our analysis is focussed on certain geometric aspects relating the present approach with other geometric formulations of fluctuation theory @xcite .",
    "such ideas straightforwardly lead to a geometric generalization of the gibbs canonical ensemble describing a special family of equilibrium distributions recently proposed in the literature @xcite , which can also be obtained from some known formulations of statistical mechanics , such as jaynes reinterpretation in terms of information theory @xcite , as well as mandelbrot s approach based on inference theory @xcite .",
    "our main motivation in deriving the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) was to arrive at a suitable extension of the known fluctuation relation : @xmath7that is compatible with the existence of macrostates with negative heat capacities @xcite .",
    "as discussed in many standard textbooks on statistical mechanics @xcite , the latter relation follows as a direct consequence of the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble : @xmath8which constitutes a starting point for many applications of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "however , such a relation is only compatible with macrostates having non - negative heat capacities , and hence , all those macrostates with negative heat capacities @xmath2 can not be appropriately described by using this statistical ensemble .",
    "in fact , such macrostates are thermodynamically unstable under this kind of equilibrium situations ( a system submerged in a certain environment ( heat reservoir or bath ) with constant inverse temperature @xmath9 ) .",
    "one can easily verify from eq.([fdr ] ) that a macrostate with a negative heat capacity @xmath2 is thermodynamically stable provided that the correlation function @xmath10 considering the existence of correlative effects between the system and its surroundings obeyed the following inequality : @xmath11    a simple interpretation ( but not the only one possible ) of the above fluctuating constraint follows from admitting that the thermostat or the surroundings is a finite system with a positive heat capacity @xmath12 .",
    "clearly , the existing energetic interchange between these systems imposes the occurrence of thermal fluctuations for the thermostat temperature @xmath13 , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the amount of energy released or absorbed by the system around its equilibrium value .",
    "such fluctuations can be rephrased as follows : @xmath16where the condition of thermal equilibrium @xmath17 is considered . by substituting eq.([bb ] ) into the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdr ] ) , we obtain:@xmath18finally , it is possible to arrive at the following inequalities : @xmath19by combining eqs.([cc])-([bp ] ) .",
    "essentially , this last result is the same constraint derived by thirring in order to ensure the thermodynamic stability of macrostates with a negative heat capacity @xcite .",
    "the study of macrostates with negative heat capacities demands that such macrostates be found in a stable equilibrium situation .",
    "as already discussed , such an aim could be implemented by considering an equilibrium situation in which the system is found in thermal contact with a bath having a _ positive and finite heat capacity _ @xmath12  that obeys thirring s constraint ( [ c.thir ] ) . the equilibrium condition associated with the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] )",
    "is unsuitable here , since the invariability of the gibbs thermostat temperature presupposes a system with an infinite heat capacity , @xmath20 , which is incompatible with inequality ( [ c.thir ] ) .",
    "the differences between these equilibrium situations are schematically illustrated in fig.[caricature.eps ] . here , the thick solid line represents the typical microcanonical caloric curve @xmath21 of a finite short - range interacting system undergoing a first - order phase transition , which is characterized by the existence of a regime with negative heat capacities ( the branch p - q ) , with @xmath22 being the energy per particle .",
    "the thin solid lines @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the inverse temperature dependencies on the system energy per particle @xmath25 of a gibbs thermostat ( with @xmath26 ) and a thermostat having a positive finite heat capacity @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the corresponding energy distribution functions .",
    "the intersection points derived from the condition of thermal equilibrium @xmath30 determine the positions of the energy distribution function @xmath31 maxima and minima .",
    "clearly , the thermal contact with a gibbs thermostat ensures the existence of only one intersection point , or equivalently , a unique peak of the canonical energy distribution function @xmath32 for most of the admissible values of the thermostat inverse temperature .",
    "the important exception takes place in the inverse temperature interval @xmath33 $ ] , where there are _ three intersection points _ ( two maxima @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 and one minimum @xmath37 with @xmath2 ) , a fact that leads to a _",
    "bimodal character _ for the distribution function @xmath38 .",
    "since no single peak can be located within the branch with negative heat capacities @xmath2 , such macrostates are poorly accessed within the gibbs canonical ensemble .",
    "in fact , they turn practically inaccessible when the system size is sufficiently large .",
    "the existence of such a _ hidden _ energetic region constitutes the origin of the latent heat @xmath39 necessary for the conversion of one phase into the other during the coexistence of low and high energy phases ( lep and hep ) , which are represented here by the coexisting peaks of the canonical energy distribution function @xmath40 .",
    "the replacement of the gibbs thermostat by a thermostat having a finite positive heat capacity crucially modifies the fluctuating behavior and the thermal stability conditions of the system .",
    "in fact , one can ensure the existence of only one intersection point , regardless the positive or negative character of its heat capacity @xmath1 , by choosing the appropriate thermostat and its internal conditions .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to ensure the applicability of thirring s constraint ( [ c.thir ] ) for macrostates with negative heat capacities @xmath2 .",
    "the above ideas have a significant impact in the framework of monte carlo simulations .",
    "as has been discussed elsewhere @xcite , large - scale monte carlo simulations are often plagued by slow sampling problems , which manifest themselves as a rapid increase in the dynamic relaxation time @xmath41 with the system size @xmath42 , causing large - size simulations to converge extremely slowly .",
    "these sampling problems are especially severe in systems near the critical point , where it is possible to distinguish two kinds of dynamical anomalies : ( 1 ) the so - called _ critical slowing down _ , where the relaxation time shows a power - law dependence on @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which can be associated with the occurrence of a continuous ( second - order ) phase transition ; and ( 2 ) the so - called _ super - critical slowing down _ , where the dynamic relaxation time exhibits a worse divergence with the system size : an exponential increasing @xmath44 , whose incidence is associated with discontinuous ( first - order ) phase transitions .    in monte carlo simulations based on a consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble , the origin of the super - critical slowing down",
    "is closely related to the existence of a multimodal character of the energy distribution function .",
    "indeed , this phenomenon manifests itself as an _ effective trapping _ of the system macrostates in one of the coexisting peaks of the energy distribution function . as the system size increases ,",
    "the mathematical form of these peaks is almost a gaussian distribution : @xmath45,\\ ] ] whose width behaves as @xmath46 .",
    "the transition to any other peak demands the occurrence of a large energy fluctuation , whose probability @xmath47 exponentially decreases as the system size decreases : @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , the characteristic timescale for the occurrence of such rare events grows as @xmath49 , which explains the slow relaxation observed for canonical expectation values in large - scale monte carlo simulations .",
    "the existence of the above slow relaxation can be avoided if one could eliminate the multimodal character of the energy distribution function by appealing to a better control of the energy fluctuations . fortunately , _ such an aim is easily achieved by considering a thermostat having a finite positive heat capacity _ @xmath50 .    under this later equilibrium situation ,",
    "the thermostat inverse temperature @xmath51 and the system energy ( per particle ) @xmath25 undergo thermal fluctuations around their equilibrium values @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which provide a suitable estimation of the intersection point of the system microcanonical caloric curve @xmath54 derived from the thermal equilibrium condition @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , the study of the fluctuating behavior in terms of correlation functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 allows us to obtain the heat capacity @xmath1 via the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) .",
    "once the microcanonical caloric curve @xmath58 has been obtained , one can easily derive other thermodynamic potentials by using known integration formulae , e.g. : the entropy @xmath59:@xmath60 the helmholtz free energy @xmath61:@xmath62 \\right\\ } d\\varepsilon,\\ ] ] and the canonical averages of a certain observable @xmath63 : @xmath64 \\right\\ } d\\varepsilon.\\ ] ]    the simplest and most general way to implement the use of a thermostat having a finite heat capacity in a classical monte carlo calculation is through the known metropolis importance sample @xcite .",
    "its extension is achieved by replacing the use of a constant inverse temperature in the acceptance probability : @xmath65with a variable inverse temperature , @xmath66 . this kind of procedure can also be used to extend some other classical monte carlo methods , such as the known swendsen - wang ( sw ) clusters algorithm @xcite , applicable to the ising model and its generalization , the @xmath67-state potts model : @xmath68(where n.n represents a set of nearest - neighbor lattice sites , @xmath69 $ ] ) , which exhibits a regime with negative heat capacities when the number of spin states @xmath67 is greater than a certain critical value depending on the lattice dimensionality @xmath70 , e.g. @xmath71 with d=2 .",
    "a direct demonstration of the applicability of the extended sw method using the present ideas in order to study the anomalous regime with @xmath2 in the @xmath72 @xmath73-state potts model is shown in fig.[montecarlo.eps ] , whose decorrelation time @xmath41 shows a weak power - law dependence @xmath74 with @xmath75 at the critical point of the discontinuous phase transition @xmath76 .",
    "generally speaking , the consideration of a finite thermostat in order to capture the anomalous regime with negative heat capacities and to avoid the super - critical slowing down should not depend on the classical or quantum nature of the system under analysis .",
    "consequently , one can expect that this idea could be used for enhancing the potentialities of some known quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdr ] ) constitutes a particular case of a very general fluctuation relation : @xmath77involving the inverse temperature difference between the surroundings ( heat reservoir or bath ) and the system @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , eq.([fdr ] ) is obtained after substituting the first - order approximation : @xmath79 into eq.([mother ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the known _ schwartz inequality _",
    ": @xmath80 in order to rewrite the fluctuation relation ( [ mother ] ) as follows : @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the thermal uncertainty of a physical observable @xmath83 .",
    "clearly , eq.([unc ] ) is a thermo - statistic analogy of the quantum mechanics uncertainty relation : @xmath84 between position @xmath67 and momentum @xmath47 , which suggests the existence of certain complementary character between thermodynamic quantities of energy and ( inverse ) temperature bohr , heisenberg , rosenfeld , scholgl , mandelbrot , uffink .",
    "it is well - known that the nature of the temperature is radically different from a direct observable quantity such as energy .",
    "in fact , it is a thermodynamic quantity whose physical meaning can only be attributed by appealing to the concept of statistical ensemble . in practice ,",
    "the system temperature is indirectly measured by using the temperature of a second system through the thermal equilibrium condition , which plays the role of a measuring apparatus ( thermometer ) , whose internal temperature dependence on some direct _ thermometric quantity _ ( e.g. : electric signal , force , volume , etc . ) is previously known . as expected ,",
    "such a measuring process unavoidably involves a perturbation on the internal state of the system under analysis .    according to uncertainty relation ( [ unc ] ) , it is impossible to simultaneously reduce the thermal uncertainties of the inverse temperature difference @xmath85 and the system energy @xmath86 to zero : any attempt to reduce the perturbation of the system energy to zero , @xmath87 , leads to a divergence of the inverse temperature difference uncertainty @xmath88 , and vice - versa .",
    "consequently , _ it is impossible to simultaneously determine of the energy and inverse temperature of a given system using the standard experimental procedures based on the thermal equilibrium with a second system_.    clearly , we have to admit non - vanishing thermal uncertainties @xmath85 and @xmath86 during any practical determination of the energy - temperature dependence of a given system , that is , its caloric curve .",
    "while such thermal uncertainties are unimportant during the study of large thermodynamic systems , they actually impose a fundamental limitation to the practical utility of thermodynamic concepts such as temperature and heat capacity in systems with few constituents . in order to avoid any misunderstanding , it must be clarified that one can obtain the energy dependence of the inverse temperature of a given system _ by calculating _",
    "its boltzmann s entropy : @xmath89 which is possible to be achieved regardless of the system size .",
    "the limitation associated with the uncertainty relation ( [ unc ] ) refers to the precision of an _ experimental measuring _ of the microcanonical caloric curve of a thermodynamic system .",
    "as previously discussed in detail in our first paper on this subject vel - unc , the rigorous fluctuation relation ( [ mother ] ) is derived from the following ansatz for the energy distribution function : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the state density of the system and @xmath92 is the probabilistic weight considering the thermodynamic influence of the surroundings ( thermostat ) .",
    "such functions are defined on a certain subset @xmath93 of euclidean real space @xmath94 , @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the next important consideration is the definition of the _ effective _ inverse temperature of the surroundings as : @xmath96 the latter assumption is not arbitrary , since it reduces to the conventional interpretation of this concept when one considers a closed system composed of two separable short - range interacting systems in thermal contact and a final thermodynamic equilibrium , which allows us to express the probabilistic weight @xmath92 in terms of the state density of the second system @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "however , the probabilistic weight @xmath92 in eq.([ansatz ] ) also admits more general system - surroundings equilibrium situations considering other modifying conditions , such as the existence of nonlinear effects driving the system - surroundings thermodynamic interaction , e.g. , the presence of long - range interactions @xcite , or a system acting as the surroundings that is found in a metastable equilibrium whose relaxation time is so long that its dynamic evolution can practically be disregarded , such as the case of systems with _",
    "glassy dynamics _ leticia .",
    "such circumstances explain why we refer to the inverse temperature ( [ beta.w ] ) as _",
    "effective_.    the number of microstates @xmath99 used to obtain the boltzmann s entropy ( [ boltzmann ] ) is given by the _ coarsed grained _",
    "definition : @xmath100 with @xmath101 being a certain small constant energy that makes @xmath99 dimensionless . the work hypothesis ( [ ansatz ] ) and definitions ( beta.w ) and ( [ coarse ] ) allow us to express the inverse temperature difference as : @xmath102 with the above relation , one can easily obtain the thermodynamic identities : @xmath103 @xmath104 which are derived by integrating by parts and considering the following boundary conditions : @xmath105 @xmath106    eq.([eq.cond ] ) is simply the thermal equilibrium condition expressed in terms of _ statistical expectation values _ :",
    "@xmath107 this rigorous result clarifies that the known equalization of ( inverse ) temperatures during the thermodynamic equilibrium of two systems actually takes place in an average sense .",
    "the fluctuation relation of eq.([mother ] ) is obtained from eqs.([eq.cond ] ) and ( [ aux.fu ] ) after using the identity @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 be a continuous and differentiable function on @xmath93 , which also admits a bound expectation value @xmath110 , @xmath111 . under these assumptions ,",
    "one can obtain the following thermodynamic identity : @xmath112 in particular , this identity reduces to eq.([eq.cond ] ) and eq.([aux.fu ] ) for @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "moreover , it also drops to the remarkable fluctuation relation : @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "this latter identity , hereafter referred to as the _ complementary fluctuation relation _ , accounts for the same information about the system stability conditions derived from the fluctuation relation of eq.([mother ] ) .",
    "for instance , by using the gaussian approximation ( see subsection gaussian.sub below ) : @xmath117 and focusing on the equilibrium situation between two separable short - range interacting systems , we obtain the fluctuation relation : @xmath118 which leads to the same stability criterion derived from eq.([bp ] ) .",
    "let us consider a bijective application @xmath119 , which is a piece - wise continuous and two time differentiable function of the variable @xmath5 .",
    "such a function allows for the existence of a bijective map @xmath120 of the subset @xmath93 on another subset @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "it could be said that these subsets constitute two equivalent _ coordinate representations _ of all admissible macrostates of the system , which shall be denoted as @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "the coordinate transformation induced by the bijective function @xmath124 is referred to as a _ reparametrization_.    since the elementary subset @xmath125 $ ] represents the same system macrostates considered by the elementary subset @xmath126 $ ] , the elementary probability @xmath127 that the system is found in such conditions , eq.([ansatz ] ) , does not depend on the coordinate representation used for its expression : @xmath128 here , @xmath129 and @xmath130 denote the system distribution functions in the representation @xmath122 and @xmath131 , respectively , which are mutually related by the transformation rule : @xmath132^{-1}.\\ ] ]    let @xmath133 be the elementary volume considering the number of microstates belonging to the elementary subset @xmath125 $ ] .",

    "clearly , such an alternative definition allows us to preserve the functional dependence of fluctuation formula ( [ ein ] ) in any coordinate representation .",
    "it requires that the entropy is no longer a state function with a scalar character , as is usually assumed in other geometric formulations of fluctuation theory @xcite .    under these above assumptions ,",

    "( 2 ) furthermore , einstein s theory refers to the same physical laws in different representations , while the above thermodynamic identities consider a family of _ different fluctuations relations _ exhibiting the same mathematical appearance under different coordinate representations of a given equilibrium situation .",

    "we shall see , however , that such a development presupposes the consideration of certain unexpected approximations .",
    "let us assume that the systems under consideration are large enough to deal with the thermodynamic fluctuations by using a _",
    "gaussian approximation_. an essential assumption considered here is that the system undergoes small thermal fluctuations close to its equilibrium point , which is determined by _",

    "this last result contracts with the general validity of the thermal equilibrium condition in terms of statistical expectation values , eq.([eq.cond.2 ] ) .",
    "it clearly indicates that the method generally used for deriving such a condition in terms of the most likely macrostate is just a suitable approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it could be easily noticed that the modification involved during the reparametrization change is just a second - order effect . the transformation rule ( [ trans.eta ] )",
    "can be combined with eq.([eq.cond ] ) and eq.([eq.cond.2 ] ) in order to obtain : @xmath178 where the following notation is considered : @xmath179 eq.([res.likely ] ) indicates that the second additive term on right - hand side of the transformation rule ( [ trans.eta ] ) is just a small correction , which can be disregarded in most practical applications .",

    "let us now rewrite planck s thermodynamic potential in the @xmath123 representation : @xmath224}\\frac{d\\theta}{\\delta\\epsilon_{\\phi}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and develop a gaussian approximation ( the second - order power expansion in @xmath225 ) around the local maxima : @xmath226 with @xmath227 and @xmath228 given by : @xmath229 the local maxima @xmath230 are derived from the stationary and stability conditions : @xmath231 by admitting the existence of only one maximum , this approximation yields : @xmath232 clearly , the additive logarithmic term in the gaussian estimation of the planck thermodynamic potential constitutes a small correction in the case of sufficiently large systems . by dismissing this small contribution",
    ", one finds that planck s thermodynamic potential is approximately given by the known _ legendre transformation _ : @xmath233 the stationary condition is merely the condition of thermal equilibrium associated with this representation , while the stability condition is simply the requirement of non - negativity of the microcanonical heat capacity @xmath208 : @xmath234    eqs.([planck])-([c.may.z ] ) correspond to many well - known dual expressions previously obtained within the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "obviously , these two ensembles are intimately related .",

    "this fact is more evident when working in the energy representation @xmath122 , where the stability condition reads as follows : @xmath243 by considering the relations @xmath244 and @xmath245 , with @xmath246 and @xmath247 being the heat capacities of the system and the thermostat respectively ( their usual definitions ) , as well as by using the thermal equilibrium condition @xmath248 , one arrives at the expression : @xmath249 which leads to thirring s stability condition ( c.thir ) for macrostates with @xmath250 .    as the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] )",
    ", the present geometric extension ( [ gen.can ] ) becomes equivalent to the microcanonical ensemble with increasing of the system size @xmath42 , @xmath251 , an equivalency that can be ensured even for macrostates with @xmath250 or @xmath241 with an appropriate selection of the reparametrization @xmath124 .",
    "this remarkable property makes this ensemble a very attractive thermo - statistical framework , since besides of exhibiting many notable properties of the usual the gibbs canonical ensemble , it also provides a better treatment of the phenomenon of ensemble inequivalence associated with the presence of negative heat capacities , as already discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "in particular , this statistical ensemble constitutes a suitable framework for extending of monte carlo methods , as discussed in subsection [ monte ] .",
    "it is possible to realize that the generalized gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gen.can ] ) can also be derived from jaynes s reinterpretation of statistical mechanics in terms of the information theory of shannon @xcite , e.g. , by considering the maximization of the known statistical ( extensive ) information entropy : @xmath252 under the normalization condition : @xmath253 and the following nonlinear energy - like constraint : @xmath254 such a derivation was developed by toral in ref.@xcite .",
    "the interested reader can refer to this work for more details .    clearly",
    ", the bijective character of the reparametrization @xmath255 should ensure that this generalized ensemble exhibits almost the same stationary properties obtained from the application of the gibbs canonical ensemble in sufficiently large systems , where one usually assumes the appropriateness of the gaussian approximation .",
    "however , the nonlinear character of the bijective application @xmath124 produces a deformation in the canonical description , which conveniently modifies the system fluctuating behavior and the accessible regions of the subset of all admissible system macrostates @xmath93 .      generally speaking , _ statistical inference _ can be described as the problem of deciding how well a set of outcomes @xmath256 , obtained from independent measurements , fits to a proposed probability distribution : @xmath257 if the probability distribution is characterized by one or more parameters ( @xmath258 ) , this problem is equivalent to inferring the value of the parameter(s ) from the observed measurement outcomes @xmath83 . to make inferences about the parameter ,",
    "one constructs estimators , i.e. , functions : @xmath259 of the outcomes of @xmath260 independent repeated measurements @xcite .",
    "the value of this function represents the best guess for @xmath258 .",
    "commonly , there exist several criteria imposed on estimators in order to ensure that their values constitute _",
    "good _ estimates of the parameter @xmath258 , such as :    * _ unbiasedness _ : @xmath261 * _ efficiency _ or minimal statistical dispersion : @xmath262 * _ sufficiency _ : @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the marginal distribution of @xmath265 and @xmath266 is an arbitrary function of the measurements , independent on @xmath258 .",
    "since any statistical estimator @xmath265 represents a stochastic quantity , it is natural in inference problems that an estimator obeys the unbiasedness ( [ unbiasedness ] ) and efficiency ( [ efficiency ] ) conditions .",
    "however , there exists a remarkable theorem of inference theory , the _ cramr - rao s inequality _ , which places an inferior bound on the efficiency of an arbitrary unbiased estimator : @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the so - called _ fisher s information entropy _ : @xmath269^{2}\\rho\\left(x|\\theta\\right)dx.\\ ] ]    on the other hand , efficiency condition ( [ sufficiency ] ) ensures that , given the value of @xmath270 , the values of the data @xmath271 are distributed independently of @xmath258 , containing in this way all of the information about parameter @xmath258 that can be obtained from the data . as with unbiasedness and efficiency , sufficiency is also a natural desirable condition in inference problems .",
    "however , a theorem by pitman and koopman @xcite states that sufficient estimators only exist for a reduced family of distribution functions , the so - called _ exponential family _ : @xmath272dx.\\ ] ]    mandelbrot was the first investigator to realize the intimate connection between statistical mechanics and inference theory @xcite .",
    "clearly , the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) constitutes a relevant physical example of probabilistic distribution function belonging to the exponential family ( [ pk ] ) . as the well - known kinchin work in the framework of information theory @xcite , mandelbrot proposed a set of axioms in order to justify a direct derivation of the gibbs canonical ensemble in the framework of inference theory . moreover , he also focussed the inference problem of the inverse temperature @xmath273 , which appears as a parameter of the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) , through some an unbiased estimator @xmath274 defined for a set of outcomes of the system energy @xmath5 . thus ,",
    "this author provided an interpretation of the _ energy - temperature complementarity _ previously postulated by bohr and heisenberg @xcite : @xmath275 with @xmath276 , a result that follows from the cramr - rao s inequality ( [ cramer.rao ] ) after noting that the fisher s information entropy ( fisher ) for the gibbs canonical distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) is simply the canonical expectation value @xmath277 of the energy dispersion , @xmath278 .",
    "after reading the present discussion , one can point out some critiques to mandelbrot s approach . in regard to his interpretation of energy - temperature complementarity , eq.([mandel.tur ] ) , it is clear that such an uncertainty relation only applies in the framework of the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "moreover , this inequality accounts for the limits of precision of a statistical estimation of the inverse temperature @xmath273 appearing as a parameter of the canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "clearly , this quantity has nothing to do with the system inverse temperature , but rather the inverse temperature of the gibbs thermostat . this is a common misunderstanding of some contemporary developments of statistical physics , where it is not distinguished between these two temperatures , leading in this way to some limitations and inconsistences .",
    "clearly , such difficulties are overcome by the uncertainty relation ( [ unc ] ) associated with the energy - temperature fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdr ] ) .",
    "the differences between the gibbs temperature of the canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) and the boltzmann s definition ( [ bb ] ) are irrelevant in the case of large short - range thermodynamic systems considered in conventional applications of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , overall , in those physical situations where the necessary conditions for the equivalence between canonical and microcanonical descriptions apply",
    ". however , the existing differences become critical when one considers the thermodynamical description of long - range interacting systems such as the astrophysical ones , where the presence of macrostates with _ negative heat capacities _ constitutes an important thermodynamic feature that rules their macroscopic behavior and dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "as already discussed , such an anomaly can not be described by using the gibbs canonical description ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "besides , there does not exist in this context an appropriate gibbs thermostat that ensures the existence of a thermal contact ( a boundary interaction ) in presence of a long - range interacting force such as gravity .",
    "the above limitations also extend to other physical contexts such as small or mesoscopic nuclear , molecular and atomic clusters , where the presence of a negative heat capacity is not an unusual feature @xcite , while the thermodynamic influence of a gibbs thermostat constitutes a very strong perturbation of its internal thermodynamic state . in this kind of scenario , there does not always exist a clear justification for the direct application of some theoretical developments based on the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble , e.g. : the use of finite - temperature calculations for the study of collisions in high energy physics .",
    "interestingly , a collective phenomenon such as the _ nuclear multi - fragmentation _ resulting from collisions of heavy nuclei is simply a first - order phase transition revealing the experimental observation of macrostates with negative heat capacities @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "clearly , such a realistic phenomenon can not be appropriately described by using the canonical ensemble .",
    "remarkably , its is easy to note that the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) is not the only one probabilistic distribution function justified in terms of inference theory , as originally presupposed by mandelbrot in his approach .",
    "in fact , the whole family of the generalized gibbs canonical ensembles ( [ gen.can ] ) also belongs to the exponential family ( [ pk ] ) , and hence , such distributions also ensure the existence of sufficient estimators @xmath279 obeying uncertainty relations _  la mandelbrot _ : @xmath280 as a consequence of the underlying reparametrization duality discussed in this work .",
    "as expected , @xmath281 , with @xmath282 being the generalized canonical expectation values derived from the generalized ensemble ( [ gen.can ] ) .",
    "we have provided in this work a panoramic overview of direct implications and connections of the energy - temperature fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdr ] ) with different challenging questions of statistical mechanics .    as briefly discussed , the main motivation and most direct consequence of this generalized fluctuation relation was the compatibility with macrostates having negative heat capacities in the framework of fluctuation theory .",
    "such a feature makes possible to analyze and apply the necessary conditions for the thermodynamical stability of such anomalous macrostates in order to extend the available monte carlo methods based on the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gibbs ] ) , a procedure that also allows one to avoid the incidence of the so - called _ super - critical slowing down _ encountered in large - scale simulations .",
    "moreover , the fluctuation - dissipation relation constitutes a particular expression of a fluctuation relation leading to the existence of a complementary relationship between thermodynamic quantities of energy and ( inverse ) temperature ( [ unc ] ) .",
    "the consideration of geometric concepts , such as coordinate changes or _ reparametrizations _ , leads to a direct extension of many old and new rigorous results of statistical mechanics in terms of a special kind of internal symmetry that we refer to here as a _ reparametrization duality_. such a basis inspires the introduction of a geometric generalized version of the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ gen.can ] ) , which has been recently proposed in the literature @xcite . this latter probabilistic distribution allows for a better treatment of the phenomenon of ensemble inequivalence or for the consideration of anomalous macrostates with negative heat capacities . at the same time",
    ", this family of distribution functions still preserves many notable properties of the gibbs canonical ensemble , including its derivation from jaynes reinterpretation of statistical mechanics in terms of information theory , as well as mandelbrot s approach based on inference theory .",
