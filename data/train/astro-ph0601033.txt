    "over the last two decades , high resolution millimeter , infrared , and optical images have provided evidence for the existence of circumstellar disks on scales of @xmath71000 au around young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "circumstellar disks are the likely birth - sites for planetary systems , and determining their ubiquity , properties , and lifetimes is crucial for constraining the timescales and mechanisms of planet formation .",
    "the mass distribution of protoplanetary disks is especially important since disk mass is related to the mass of planets that may potentially form .",
    "the minimum - mass protosolar nebula , @xmath8 m@xmath6 @xcite , is an informative benchmark against which to compare disk masses around young stars , and such comparisons can constrain the number of protoplanetary disks with the potential to form planetary systems like our own solar system . while direct imaging at optical through near - ir wavelengths has provided concrete evidence for a limited number of circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations of near - ir excess emission have shown statistically that most young stars with ages less than a few million years still possess inner circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these studies did not constrain the disk mass distribution . to probe the bulk of the disk mass , which resides in cooler , outer disk regions , observations of optically - thin millimeter emission",
    "are needed .",
    "several investigators have carried out comprehensive single - dish mm and sub - mm continuum surveys toward regions of star formation comprising loose aggregates of stars : taurus @xcite , @xmath9 ophiuchi @xcite , lupus @xcite , chamaeleon i @xcite , serpens @xcite , and mbm 12 @xcite . in taurus ,",
    "37% of stars appear to possess disks more massive than @xmath8 m@xmath6 , and the median disk mass is @xmath10 m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of massive disks and the median disk mass is comparable in @xmath9 ophiuchi @xcite .",
    "expanding millimeter continuum surveys to include rich clusters allows the determination of accurate statistics on the frequency and evolution of massive disks as a function of both stellar mass and age . also , since most stars in the galaxy form in rich clusters @xcite , understanding disk formation and evolution in cluster environments is a vital component in our general understanding of how stars and planets form .",
    "the main challenge to observing rich clusters at mm - wavelengths is that very high angular resolution is required to resolve individual sources and to distinguish compact disk emission from the more extended emission of the molecular cloud .",
    "single - aperture mm - wavelength telescopes lack sufficient angular resolution , and to date , only three rich clusters have been observed with mm - wavelength interferometers : the orion nebula cluster @xcite , ic 348 @xcite , and ngc 2024 @xcite .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity of the most recent observations of orion has enabled the detection of several massive ( @xmath11 m@xmath6 ) disks @xcite , while upper limits from other surveys range from @xmath120.17 m@xmath6 @xcite . moreover , extending detection limits by considering as ensembles the large numbers ( @xmath13 ) of young stars included in the surveys of ic 348 and ngc 2024 allowed estimates of mean disk masses of @xmath14 and 0.005 m@xmath5 , respectively @xcite . while it appears that an average star aged @xmath15 myr still possesses a massive circumstellar disk , more sensitive observations are necessary to detect directly large numbers of massive disks at a range of ages , and thereby constrain the mass distribution and evolutionary timescales .    here , we present a new mm - wavelength interferometric survey of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , a young , deeply embedded stellar cluster that includes the bright , massive trapezium stars .",
    "the trapezium region contains hundreds of stars within several arcminutes , and pre - main - sequence evolutionary models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fitted to spectroscopic and/or photometric data indicate that most stars are less than approximately one million years old ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , the standard deviation in the distribution of inferred stellar ages is @xmath15 myr @xcite .",
    "our observations thus provide a snapshot of millimeter emission around a large number of roughly coeval young stars .    with the large number of stars in the onc",
    ", we can begin to investigate the correlation of disk properties with stellar and/or environmental properties .",
    "previous investigations of near - ir excess emission have explored the dependence of inner disk properties on stellar mass , age , and environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the fraction of stars in orion exhibiting near - ir excess emission seems largely independent of stellar age and mass , although there are indications of a paucity of disks around very massive stars @xcite . in addition , the inner disk fraction may decrease at larger cluster radii @xcite . to explore how the properties of the outer disk component correlate with such stellar and environmental properties , millimeter observations of cool , optically - thin dust emission are necessary .",
    "our observations represent an improvement over previous work because our mosaicked image encompasses more than three times as many sources as the previous surveys , enabling an improvement of @xmath16 in estimates of frequency and mean mass of circumstellar disks .",
    "moreover , the comparable sensitivity of this survey with previous observations of ic 348 and ngc 2024 allows a more direct comparison between relatively young ( ngc 2024 : 0.3 myr ; meyer 1996 ; ali 1996 ) , intermediate ( onc : 1 myr ; hillenbrand 1997 ) , and old ( ic 348 : 2 myr ; luhman et al . 1998 ; luhman 1999 ) clusters , providing constraints on timescales for disk evolution .",
    "we mosaicked a @xmath1 region toward the onc in @xmath23 mm continuum with the ovro millimeter array between august , 2003 and march , 2004 .",
    "continuum data were recorded using the new cobra correlator , providing a total of 8 ghz of bandwidth centered at 100 ghz .",
    "two different configurations of the 6-element array provided baselines between 35 and 240 meters . as shown in figure [ fig : pointings_o2 ] , the mosaic consists of sixteen pointing centers . for observations in a given night ,",
    "the mosaic was observed in its entirety once or twice ( depending on the length of the track ) , with equal integration time ( and hence equal sensitivity ) for each pointing position .",
    "we calibrated the amplitudes and phases of the data with the blazar j0530 + 135 : @xmath17 .",
    "three minute observations of j0530 + 135 were interleaved with sixteen minute integrations on the target mosaic .",
    "we estimated the flux for j0530 + 135 using neptune and uranus as flux calibrators .",
    "since we obtained data over an eight month time - span , and j0530 + 135 is variable , we estimated the flux for each array configuration .",
    "for observations in the less extended `` e '' configuration ( spanning august - september 2003 ) , we calculated a mean flux of 2.91 jy based on four measurements , and the rms in the flux measurements was 0.21 jy . for observations in the `` h '' configuration ( spanning december , 2003-march , 2004 ) , we determined a flux of @xmath18 jy and an rms of 0.14 jy using eight measurements .",
    "all data calibration was performed using a suite of idl routines developed for the mir software package .",
    "we mosaicked the sixteen individual pointings into a single image , robustly weighted the data ( using a robust parameter of 0.5 ) , then de - convolved and cleaned the mosaic using the miriad package @xcite .",
    "since we are primarily interested in compact disk emission , we eliminated @xmath19 spacings shorter than 35 k@xmath2 in order to avoid contamination from bright extended emission .",
    "the eliminated spacings correspond to size scales larger than @xmath20 .",
    "the cutoff value was chosen to minimize the rms background noise in the cleaned image .",
    "we note that previous analyses of the onc have also eliminated data with uv spacings @xmath21 k@xmath2 @xcite to filter out the extended emission in the region .",
    "the mosaic produced from our robust - weighted data with @xmath22 k@xmath2 is shown in figure [ fig : map_o2 ] .",
    "the unit gain region of the mosaic encompasses a @xmath1 area , as indicated by the solid curve .",
    "the fwhm of the synthesized beam is @xmath23 .",
    "the rms varies across the mosaic , because of varying amounts of sidelobe emission from point sources and extended emission that were not removed by clean .",
    "we calculate the rms of the image in @xmath24 sub - regions , and find values ranging from 0.88 mjy to 2.34 mjy . despite these variations in rms ,",
    "the noise across the mosaic is largely gaussian and the `` effective '' noise for the mosaic is 1.75 mjy ( figure [ fig : noise ] ) .",
    "when searching for detections , we begin by considering only the positions of known near - ir cluster members @xcite that lie within the unit gain contour of our ovro mosaic ( figure [ fig : map_o2 ] ) . for these 336 pre - determined positions ,",
    "@xmath25 sources are expected to show emission above the 3@xmath3 level from gaussian noise , and we therefore employ a 3@xmath3 detection threshold , where @xmath3 is the noise determined locally in @xmath24 sub - regions .    in order to determine whether 3 mm continuum emission is coincident with near - ir source positions , we estimate relative positional uncertainties from the centroiding uncertainty for millimeter sources ( @xmath26signal - to - noise @xmath27 ) and the uncertainty in the near - ir source positions ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the 1@xmath3 relative astrometric uncertainty is @xmath29 , and only objects for which the millimeter emission lies within @xmath30 of the @xmath31-band stellar position are claimed as coincident .",
    "we detect 3 mm continuum emission above the 3@xmath3 level toward 10 near - ir detected objects ( table [ tab : detections ] ) .",
    "the 3 mm emission for these detections appears point - like , with fwhm comparable to that of the synthesized beam .",
    "ovro 3 mm continuum images of detected sources coincident with near - ir cluster member positions are displayed in figure [ fig : detections ] .",
    "one of the sources detected at both near - ir and 3 mm wavelengths is the bn object @xcite , and six others correspond with optically- and radio - detected proplyds @xcite .",
    "although gaussian noise is expected to produce less than one false detection , there may still be chance coincidences with sidelobe artifacts in regions containing bright , nearby 3 mm emission sources .",
    "thus , hc 178 and hc 192 , which occur in crowded areas displaying bright positive and negative emission ( figure [ fig : detections ] ) , should be regarded with some caution .",
    "we also search for detections in the mosaic toward positions that do not correspond with known onc cluster members .",
    "for the entire mosaic , which contains substantially more pixels than those considered for near - ir detected objects , a 5@xmath3 detection limit is employed to ensure that we are not `` detecting '' noise spikes in the .",
    "twenty additional objects , without near - ir counterparts , are detected in 3 mm continuum emission above the 5@xmath3 level ( table [ tab : detections ] ) .",
    "since many of these detections occur in crowded regions ( figure [ fig : map_o2 ] ) , listed fluxes for these objects may be contaminated by sidelobe emission from other nearby sources .",
    "free - free emission arises in hot ionized gas , and in the onc such conditions may exist either in hii regions around high - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or in the outer regions of disks or envelopes that are irradiated by the hot trapezium stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our 3 mm fluxes may thus trace some free - free emission from hot gas in addition to thermal continuum emission from cool dust . because the spectral shape of free - free radiation differs from that of thermal dust emission ,",
    "comparing our 3 mm measurements with longer - wavelength data enables us to distinguish these components .",
    "moreover , radio wavelength observations have sufficient sensitivity ( @xmath32 mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to detect all of the sources detected in our 3 mm mosaic , if the 3 mm flux traces free - free emission .",
    "we model our observed 3 mm continuum fluxes including both free - free and dust emission .",
    "the free - free emission is parameterized by a turnover frequency , @xmath33 , which demarcates where the radiation switches from optically - thick to optically - thin , and by the flux at this frequency , @xmath34 : @xmath35 emission from cool dust is added to this free - free emission to obtain a model of the observed flux .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we estimate the relative contributions of dust and free - free emission by fitting this model , @xmath38 , to our measured 3 mm fluxes and 3.5 mm , 2 cm , 6 cm , and 20 cm fluxes from the literature @xcite . given the noise level of the centimeter observations ( @xmath32 mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our measured 3 mm fluxes ( @xmath39 mjy ) , for objects undetected at centimeter wavelengths , less than @xmath40 of the 3 mm emission can be free - free . for simplicity , we attribute 100% of the 3 mm flux to dust emission for these objects . for objects detected at centimeter wavelengths ,",
    "we fit the dust+free - free model to the @xmath41 flux measurements for each source , and thus we are able to determine the three free parameters of the model , @xmath33 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . long - wavelength fluxes and models",
    "are plotted in figure [ fig : seds ] , and the fluxes due to thermal dust emission are listed in column 5 of table [ tab : detections ] .",
    "uncertainties for these dust fluxes are given by the 1@xmath3 uncertainties of the model fits .",
    "three of the objects in table [ tab : detections ] that are also seen at near - ir wavelengths ( hc 178 , hc 192 , and hc 282 ) were undetected at longer wavelengths , indicating that the 3 mm emission probably traces dust . moreover , although hc 774 is detected at 20 cm , it is undetected at either 2 or 6 cm , indicating that the long - wavelength measurement probably traces some non - thermal , variable emission mechanism , while the ovro flux likely arises from cool dust emission . for the remaining 6 sources , which were also detected in the 2 - 20 cm surveys of @xcite , at least some components of the measured 3 mm fluxes are likely due to free - free emission .",
    "while for most objects some of the observed flux probably arises from dust emission , for hc 322 and hc 323 , 100% of the 3 mm flux may be due to free - free emission .",
    "observations at 850 @xmath44 m showed that even at shorter wavelengths , 100% of the emission from hc 323 may be free - free , while hc 322 probably has some emission from cool dust @xcite .    because hc 336 ( @xmath4oria ) is highly variable at centimeter wavelengths @xcite ,",
    "the flux due to dust listed in table [ tab : detections ] is uncertain .",
    "previous observations at 3.5 mm wavelength did not detect this object above an rms noise level of @xmath45 mjy @xcite ; our measured flux of @xmath46 mjy indicates that this object is also highly variable at millimeter wavelengths , arguing for non - thermal emission .",
    "thus , the flux component attributed to dust in table [ tab : detections ] is an upper limit .    among the sources detected at 3 mm but not at near - ir wavelengths , only one is detected at wavelengths @xmath47 cm , irc2 . for this object",
    ", only @xmath48 of the flux can be attributed to free - free emission .",
    "two other objects ( mm8 and mm14 ) are detected at 1.3 cm wavelength with flux densities @xmath15 mjy @xcite ; the measured 3 mm flux densities are @xmath49 times higher ( table [ tab : detections ] ) .",
    "thus , it appears that free - free emission does not contribute substantially to the 3 mm flux from objects without near - ir counterparts ; the lack of free - free emission may indicate that these sources are very embedded in the cloud , shielded from ionizing radiation .    in our calculation of the relative contributions to the 3 mm flux of free - free and dust emission , we assumed that @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , @xmath50 may be smaller if grains are substantially larger in protoplanetary disks than in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the assumed value of @xmath50 is not crucial to our calculations .",
    "if we instead assume that @xmath51 , the derived component of the 3 mm flux due to dust changes by only a few percent or less .",
    "the mass of circumstellar material ( dust + gas , assuming a standard ism gas to dust mass ratio of 100 ) is related to the component of the 3 mm continuum flux due to dust emission . assuming the emission is optically - thin , and following @xcite , @xmath52 here",
    ", @xmath53 is the observed frequency , @xmath54 is the observed flux due to cool dust , @xmath55 is the distance to the source , @xmath56 is the mass opacity , @xmath57 is the dust temperature , and @xmath58 is the planck function .",
    "we assume @xmath59 pc @xcite , @xmath60 @xmath61 g@xmath62 at 1300 @xmath44 m , @xmath63 @xcite , and @xmath64 k ( based on the average dust temperature inferred for taurus ; andrews & williams 2005 ; see also the discussion in carpenter 2002 ; williams et al .",
    "while it is possible that external heating by the massive trapezium stars will lead to higher disk temperatures than in taurus , we nevertheless assume that @xmath65 k for consistency with previous studies .",
    "uncertainties in the assumed values of @xmath57 and @xmath66 imply that the derived masses are uncertain ( in an absolute sense ) by at least a factor of @xmath67 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with our assumed values for these parameters , the masses of detected sources in our ovro mosaic ( table [ tab",
    ": detections ] ) range from 0.13 to 1.45 m@xmath6 .    since some of the objects in table [ tab : detections ] may be massive stars , the millimeter flux may contain contributions from dust substantially hotter than the assumed 20 k. the high luminosity of the bn object ( @xmath68 l@xmath6 ) implies a spectral type of b3-b4 @xcite , and the luminosity of @xmath4oria implies a spectral type of o7 @xcite .",
    "in addition , irc2 is probably a massive star , and the high luminosity of nearby `` source i '' provides additional dust heating @xcite .",
    "for these sources , the computed dust masses are over - estimated , since smaller masses of hotter dust can produce the observed 3 mm emission ( for example , if @xmath69 k then the computed dust masses would be lower by a factor of 3.3 ) .",
    "the circumstellar masses listed in table [ tab : detections ] for bn ( hc 705 ) , @xmath4oria ( hc 336 ) , and irc2 ( mm 3 ) should therefore be treated as upper limits .",
    "other detected objects do not have known stellar masses , but are likely to be low - mass stars ( see  [ sec : nondet ] )",
    ". thus , the assumptions in equation [ eq : mass_o2 ] are plausible for most of the objects in table [ tab : detections ] .",
    "our ovro observations alone do not have the angular resolution or kinematic information necessary to determine whether the circumstellar material is distributed in disks or envelopes , or combinations of the two .",
    "where 3 mm emission is detected toward known near - ir cluster members , the fact that the near - ir light is visible despite the high extinctions ( @xmath70 ) that would arise for dust masses inferred from the 3 mm fluxes ( for spherically distributed material ) implies that the dust lies in flattened , disk - like distributions ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are , however , exceptions to this argument .    massive stars may be surrounded by hotter dust than low - mass stars , and for these objects smaller dust masses ( with smaller associated extinction of near - ir light ) can produce the observed emission .",
    "furthermore , the high extinctions ( @xmath71 mags ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observed toward the high - mass stars detected at 3 mm could be consistent with spherically distributed material .",
    "thus , we can not necessarily infer a flattened distribution of dust around @xmath4oria or bn based on the observed 3 mm fluxes . however , most of the stars in our observations have masses @xmath15 m@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus the extinction argument generally applies , suggesting that most objects detected in both millimeter and near - ir emission trace flattened structures .",
    "our claim that objects detected in both 3 mm and near - ir emission are flattened structures is bolstered by the fact that six of the detected sources correspond to proplyds observed by @xcite , and some of these show flattened disk - like morphologies @xcite .",
    "this is particularly striking for hc 774 , where optical images show a flattened ring - like structure surrounding a central , extincted star @xcite .",
    "however , we can not be sure that flattened structures observed around these stars are geometrically thin disks in keplerian rotation , as opposed to flattened disk+envelope structures such as those inferred around some class i objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only 3% of the known near - ir cluster members in the trapezium region are detected in 3 mm continuum emission , and thus the vast majority of objects are undetected in our observations . in order to examine the flux distribution for `` typical '' low - mass stars in the onc",
    ", we consider the distribution of 3 mm fluxes observed for the ensemble of the remaining 326 undetected near - ir cluster members ; the large number of sources allows an enhanced sensitivity for the ensemble compared to that for an individual object .    while spectra are unavailable for most of the stars in the central region of the cluster ( where we are observing ) , for the @xmath72 objects within the unit gain contour where spectra have been obtained , @xmath73 have stellar masses @xmath74 m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , near - infrared photometric studies of all sources within the unit gain contour confirm that most stars have masses between 0.1 and @xmath75 m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_o2 ] shows the distribution of mm - wavelength fluxes observed toward 326 @xmath31-band sources in the onc , none of which are detected individually above the 3@xmath3 level .",
    "the 30 bright point sources visible in figure [ fig : map_o2 ] were removed using clean before computing this histogram .",
    "we also plot the flux distribution measured for all other pixels within the unit gain contour ( after subtraction of bright point sources ) .",
    "the mean flux observed for the ensemble of 326 near - ir cluster members is 0.267 mjy , and the standard deviation of the mean is @xmath76 jy . the flux distribution is thus biased to positive values with respect to the noise distribution , and the significance of this bias is 3@xmath3 .",
    "it appears that while none of these @xmath31-band objects are detected individually in 3 mm continuum emission above the 3@xmath3 level , there may be weak emission below the 3@xmath3 level from circumstellar disks .",
    "this positive bias is also illustrated in the right panel of figure [ fig : hist_o2 ] , which shows an average image of the 3 mm flux observed toward @xmath31-band sources , obtained by averaging @xmath77 images centered around each object .",
    "we cleaned this average image in order to remove negative features associated with sidelobe emission .",
    "however , some negative features remain , presumably as a result of residual calibration errors which prevent perfect cleaning .",
    "the `` average '' disk is detected at a significance of @xmath78 , and is centered on the mean position of @xmath31-band sources ( within positional uncertainties ) .",
    "in addition , the fwhm of the emission in figure [ fig : hist_o2 ] , @xmath79 , is comparable to the fwhm of the beam , suggesting that the positive bias observed in figure [ fig : hist_o2 ] represents underlying weak mm - wavelength emission from point sources .",
    "we conclude that the average flux is dominated by small - scale emission such as that expected for circumstellar disks .",
    "because the sensitivity of previous radio - wavelength surveys @xcite is comparable to this average flux , we can not rule out some contribution of free - free emission to the mean flux . while the average flux arising from cool dust emission",
    "may therefore be somewhat lower than 0.27 mjy , we ignore this effect here , and await more sensitive long - wavelength observations to provide better constraints on low levels of free - free emission .",
    "for the 326 known @xmath31-band sources , which predominantly have stellar masses between 0.1 and 1 m@xmath6 @xcite , our assumptions in equation [ eq : mass_o2 ] should be valid , and the conversion from 3 mm flux into mass should be reliable ( modulo the uncertainties concerning free - free emission discussed above ) .",
    "the mean circumstellar mass among the 326 low - mass @xmath31-band sources within the unit gain contour of our ovro mosaic is @xmath80 m@xmath6 .",
    "we detected 30 objects in the onc in 3 mm continuum emission , 10 of which correspond to near - ir cluster members .",
    "as discussed above , for objects detected only in 3 mm emission , we can not determine whether the dust is distributed in disks , envelopes , or combinations of the two .",
    "furthermore , for massive stars the geometry and total mass of circumstellar material are uncertain since the dust may be substantially hotter than we assume above .",
    "thus , we exclude the bn object and @xmath4oria from the list of near - ir+mm detected objects when discussing massive disks .",
    "since our 3@xmath3 detection threshold for 3 mm emission corresponds to a mass of @xmath7 m@xmath6 ( if 100% of the observed flux arises from dust emission ) , in this section we will consider the statistics of disks more massive than 0.1 m@xmath6 .",
    "for the eight presumably low - mass mm+ir detected sources , the 3 mm emission from two objects ( hc 322 and hc 323 ) is dominated by free - free emission , leaving only six massive disk candidates .",
    "furthermore , the 1@xmath3 uncertainty on the free - free emission contribution to the 3 mm flux for hc 241 can not exclude a disk mass @xmath81 m@xmath6 .",
    "thus , it appears that at most 6/336 onc cluster members ( @xmath82 ) possess massive circumstellar disks .",
    "the large dust mass inferred for some of these objects is higher than typically found for circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may imply that some of these young stars are surrounded by flattened disk+envelope structures , such as those inferred around some class i objects @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the two highest - mass disks are found in crowded regions , and thus the large inferred masses may be contaminated by sidelobe emission from nearby bright sources ( figure [ fig : detections ] ;  [ sec : detections ] )",
    ".    our observations did not find large millimeter fluxes toward the positions of most near - ir cluster members in the onc : @xmath82 of the near - ir cluster members have disk masses higher than @xmath7 m@xmath6 .",
    "although k - l color excesses of onc members suggest that @xmath83 of the stars have circumstellar disks @xcite , these two estimates of the disk fraction are not contradictory , since the near - ir emission probes trace material ( @xmath84 m@xmath6 ) within @xmath7 au of the star , while the millimeter emission traces massive ( @xmath85 m@xmath6 ) outer circumstellar material .",
    "furthermore , when treated as an ensemble , millimeter emission is detected from near - ir objects in the mean , implying an average disk mass of @xmath86 m@xmath6 .",
    "based on our analysis of the ensemble of non - detected sources , it appears that most stars in the onc likely possess disks with masses on the order of 0.005 m@xmath6 .",
    "thus , the `` average disk '' in this region is comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula ( @xmath8 m@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that most stars in the trapezium region may be capable of forming solar systems like our own . since most stars in the galaxy , including our sun , probably formed in regions like orion",
    ", it seems that the capability to form analogs of our solar system is fairly common .",
    "our survey covered a larger field than the recent observations of @xcite , but with a lower mass sensitivity . because @xcite observed at 850 @xmath44 m , even though their flux sensitivity ( 2.7 mjy ) was poorer than ours ( @xmath87 mjy ) ,",
    "the steep spectral dependence of dust emission ( equation [ eq : dust ] ) means that their observations were sensitive to smaller dust masses .",
    "thus , @xcite detected three additional objects ( ow 170 - 337 , ow 171 - 334 , and ow 171 - 340 ) with circumstellar masses of @xmath8 m@xmath6 , which were below our detection threshold .",
    "however , the larger area covered by our mosaic allowed us to detect emission from massive disks around four proplyds ( ow 177 - 341 , ow 158 - 327 , ow 158 - 314 , and ow 182 - 413 ) that were outside of the @xcite survey area .",
    "it has been suggested that circumstellar disks in clustered environments may be truncated due to close encounters with massive stars resulting in either tidal stripping or photo - evaporation of outer disk material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "evidence of this hypothesis has recently been inferred from the observation that brown dwarfs appear more common in the onc than in the lower - stellar - density taurus region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this result and its interpretation remain controversial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the observations presented here do not have sufficient angular resolution to spatially resolve the outer disk radius , we can test the truncation hypothesis by comparing the disk mass distribution in the onc and taurus since truncated disks will be less massive than un - truncated disks .    as discussed in  [ sec : disc_mass ] , we detected disks more massive than @xmath7 m@xmath6 around @xmath82 of low - mass onc cluster members . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath88 of taurus stars possess such massive disks @xcite .",
    "the average disk masses in the two regions are also comparable .",
    "thus , the fraction of massive disks in taurus and orion appears similar , arguing against the hypothesis that massive disks are truncated through close encounters with high - mass cluster members .",
    "we caution , however , that if dust temperatures in the onc are systematically higher than in taurus ( equation [ eq : mass_o2 ] ;  [ sec : masses ] ) , then the percentage of high - mass disks in the onc would be reduced relative to taurus",
    ".    environmental effects on massive disks can also be investigated through the dependence of disk properties on cluster radius .",
    "we therefore consider the positions of the six massive disks detected in our observations ( i.e. , the subset of the 10 near - ir+mm detected objects that are not massive stars and are not dominated by free - free emission ; see  [ sec : disc_mass ] ) relative to the cluster center , which we define to lie roughly in the middle of the four bright trapezium stars at @xmath89 . within @xmath90 of the cluster center ,",
    "8% of stars ( 1/13 ) possess massive disks , while this percentage falls to 4% ( 1/25 ) between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and never higher than 5% in successive annuli throughout the remainder of the unit gain contour ( 4/290 sources with radii @xmath92 ) .",
    "while projection effects may complicate the interpretation of this apparent trend , the marginally higher percentage of massive disks close to the massive trapezium stars provides some further support against the hypothesis of disk truncation through close encounters .",
    "although the distribution of massive disks in the onc can not be distinguished from that of taurus , previous observations of the disk mass distributions in the rich clusters ngc 2024 @xcite and ic 348 @xcite showed a statistically significant difference from taurus . based on these earlier results , we argued previously that the physical conditions in rich clusters might be responsible for observed differences between clustered and isolated environments .",
    "more sensitive interferometric observations are necessary to detect millimeter emission from a larger sample of disks , to place more definitive constraints on correlations of disk mass with environment .",
    "we compare our results for the onc with analogous 3 mm continuum surveys of ngc 2024 @xcite and ic 348 @xcite .",
    "ngc 2024 and ic 348 , are somewhat less dense than the onc , but still each contain on the order of @xmath93 stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , spectroscopically - determined masses in the onc @xcite and ic 348 @xcite , and estimated masses from color - magnitude diagrams in ngc 2024 @xcite indicate similar stellar mass ranges in the three clusters , although the spectral types of the most massive stars are somewhat cooler in ngc 2024 ( @xmath94o8 ; * ? ? ? * ) and ic 348 ( b5 ; * ? ? ? * ) than in orion .",
    "comparison of the disk mass distributions can provide insights into disk evolution , since the three clusters have apparently different ages .",
    "ages computed by comparing cluster member positions in an hr diagram to the predictions of pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks ( using the same models for each cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the degree of embeddedness for each cluster indicate that ngc 2024 is probably younger then the onc , which is in turn younger than ic 348 @xcite .    the average disk masses for `` typical '' stars in the three regions ( i.e. , the vast majority of cluster members not detected individually in 3 mm emission ) is plotted as a function of cluster age in figure [ fig : evol ] . in ngc 2024 , the mean disk mass is @xmath95 m@xmath6 @xcite , compared to @xmath80 in the onc , and @xmath96 m@xmath6 in ic 348 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fraction of objects detected in millimeter emission ( without near - ir counterparts ) is higher in ngc 2024 ( @xmath97 ) and the onc ( @xmath98 ) than in ic 348 ( 0% ) .",
    "in fact , since the observations of the onc had a poorer 3@xmath3 mass sensitivity for individual sources , 0.1 m@xmath6 versus 0.035 m@xmath6 in ngc 2024 @xcite and 0.025 m@xmath6 in ic 348 @xcite , the fraction of structures in the onc with comparable masses to those detected in ngc 2024 may be somewhat higher . assuming that the differences between ngc 2024 , the onc , and ic 348 are due to temporal evolution , these observations indicate that massive disks / envelopes may dissipate on timescales @xmath99 myr , and that the average disk mass may decrease by a factor of @xmath100 between @xmath101 and 2 myr .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the total millimeter emission is sensitive to dust grain properties in addition to total dust mass .",
    "for example , a given mass of dust grains larger than the observing wavelength emits less radiation than the same mass of small dust particles , and the millimeter flux therefore depends on dust grain properties in addition to the total mass .",
    "furthermore , the presence of hotter stars in the onc ( relative to ngc 2024 and ic 348 ) may potentially lead to systematically higher disk temperatures , which would lead to smaller inferred masses ( equation [ eq : mass_o2 ] ) : if @xmath69 k , disk masses would be reduced by a factor of 3.3 .",
    "thus , observed evolution in the millimeter flux may indicate that one or more of the assumed quantities in equation [ eq : mass_o2 ] ( e.g. , temperature or opacity ) is different in the three regions .",
    "regardless of the underlying factors , our measurements provide a 2@xmath3 suggestion of evolution between @xmath101 and 2 myr .",
    "future , more sensitive measurements of the disk mass distributions in larger numbers of clusters will decrease the uncertainties in figure [ fig : evol ] , enabling more concrete constraints on the evolutionary timescales of massive disks .",
    "moreover , follow - up observations at multiple wavelengths will begin to break degeneracies between dust grain properties and temperatures , and total disk masses .",
    "we observed a @xmath1 region of the orion nebula cluster in @xmath23 mm continuum emission with the owens valley millimeter array .",
    "the mosaic encompassed 336 young stars in the vicinity of the massive trapezium stars , and constrained the disk mass distribution for this large number of cluster members .",
    "we detected 30 objects in 3 mm continuum emission above the 3@xmath3 limit , 10 of which correspond with near - ir cluster members .",
    "six of these , in turn , also correspond with optically - detected proplyds .",
    "comparison of our measured fluxes with longer wavelength observations enabled rough separation of emission due to dust and that due to thermal free - free emission , and we found that the 3 mm emission toward 8 objects likely arises , in part , from dust .",
    "we argued that with the exception of the massive stars @xmath4oria and the bn object , sources detected in both 3 mm and near - ir emission are probably young stars surrounded by disks , and we computed circumstellar masses of @xmath102-@xmath103 m@xmath6 based on observed 3 mm fluxes ( these masses are uncertain by at least a factor of three due to uncertainties in converting flux into mass ) . since the vast majority ( @xmath104 ) of near - ir cluster members do not possess disks more massive than @xmath7 m@xmath6 , we placed constraints on lower - mass disks by considering the ensemble of 326 non - detected , predominantly low - mass stars .",
    "for the ensemble , we computed an average disk mass of 0.005 m@xmath6 , which has a statistical significance of 3@xmath3 ( although the absolute value of the mass contains larger uncertainties related to converting flux into mass ) .",
    "the average disk in the onc is thus comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula , suggesting that most young ( @xmath15 myr ) stars in richly clustered environments ( and by extension , most stars in the galaxy ) are surrounded by sufficient circumstellar masses to form solar systems like our own .",
    "furthermore , we found that the frequency of massive disks in the onc appears similar to that in taurus , perhaps refuting suggestions that disks in orion are truncated due to close encounters with the massive trapezium stars .",
    "finally , we compared the disk mass distributions in three clusters of different ages to begin to constrain the evolutionary timescales of massive disks .",
    "although substantial uncertainties remain , it appears that massive disks may evolve significantly on 1 - 2 myr timescales .",
