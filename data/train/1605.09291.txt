    "the very strong influence of dilute polymers solutions on turbulent flows indicates an underlying spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon .",
    "what fundamental symmetry can be spontaneously broken by this additive ?",
    "the answer is about obvious .",
    "it is well known that in elasticity the location of the particle in an unstressed configuration is often used as the material coordinate . for fluid particles",
    "the situation is drastically different because these particles can be rearranged without the creation of stress .",
    "the absence of an unique unstressed reference configuration of a fluid is called particle relabeling symmetry ( or merely relabeling symmetry , since this symmetry represents the arbitrariness of providing fluid elements with lagrangian labels - any transformations that conserve the density of labels @xcite ) .",
    "the standard elasticity has no such fundamental symmetry , while the other fundamental symmetry groups : rotations and translations , are still present @xcite .",
    "therefore , even small additives of the polymers to fluids can result in spontaneous breaking of the fundamental relabeling symmetry . in order to understand main consequences of such spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "one should recall that the fundamental symmetries , due to the noether s theorems , result in the fundamental conservation laws .",
    "namely , the translational symmetry ( homogeneity ) in time and space results in conservation of energy and momentum ( birkhoff - saffman invariant @xcite,@xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the rotational symmetry ( isotropy ) results in the angular momentum conservation ( loitsyanskii invariant @xcite ) .",
    "the relabeling symmetry results in conservation of helicity in inviscid fluids @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ( in the fluids with non - zero viscosity the reflexional symmetry should be broken in order to `` switch on '' the integral viscosity dissipation / production of helicity ) .",
    "therefore , the spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry should be strongly related to violation of the helicity invariance ( even in the viscous turbulence ) . of course , this is valid for the _ dilute _ polymer solutions only , because for a strong solution one can not already speak about a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "spontaneous breaking of a fundamental symmetry can strongly affect distributed chaos in turbulence ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . spectrum of the distributed chaos in turbulence is a weighted superposition of exponentials converged into a stretch exponential @xmath3 the parameter @xmath4 is related to scaling exponent @xmath5 of the group velocity of the waves ( pulses ) driving the chaos @xmath6 namely , @xmath7 in isotropic homogeneous turbulence the momentum correlation integral ( the birkhoff - saffman invariant , a consequence of the space translational symmetry , see introduction ) @xmath8 dominates the scaling eq .",
    "( 2 ) and provides @xmath9 from the dimensional considerations : @xmath10 corresponding @xmath11 ( eq . ( 3 ) ) .",
    "spontaneous breaking of the space translational symmetry ( homogeneity ) replaces the birkhoff - saffman invariant by vorticity correlation integral @xmath12 and , due to the dimensional considerations @xmath13 provides @xmath14 .    if one wants to use the same approach as in the ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry , then a natural choice of the invariant ( instead of the birkhoff - saffman invariant ) is the helicity correlation integral ( see introduction ) @xmath15 ( the levich - tsinober invariant @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , it can be readily shown that this choice results in @xmath16 .",
    "fortunately , there is another helicity based invariant @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the viscous and elastic terms , respectively .",
    "then from the dimensional considerations @xmath21 i.e. @xmath22 and from eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath23 for the spontaneously broken relabeling symmetry .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath24 , that is important for suppression of small - scale turbulence .",
    "it should be noted that the spontaneous symmetry breaking can have a localized character @xcite - in blobs .",
    "in recent direct numerical simulations ( dns ) @xcite,@xcite of fully developed turbulent channel flows the viscoelastic fluid was modeled using the fene - p constitutive equation , with a ratio of the newtonian viscosity to the total zero - shear viscosity of @xmath25 and at the highest friction reynolds number available to date , @xmath26 .",
    "two different regimes of drag reduction were considered : a flow with medium percentage drag reduction ( 30% ) and one with a high percentage of drag reduction ( 58% ) , corresponding polymer lengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ( friction weissenberg numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows power spectral density of the streamwise velocity at the wall - normal position @xmath31 for newtonian fluid in log - log scales .",
    "the data are taken from ref .",
    "the solid curve is drawn in order to indicate the stretched exponential spectrum eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath14 corresponding to the distributed chaos with spontaneously broken space translational symmetry eq . ( 7 ) ( cf ref .",

    "( 1 ) with @xmath1 eq . ( 11 ) ( the spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry ) as a straight line .",

    "( 1 ) with @xmath14 corresponding to the distributed chaos with spontaneously broken space translational symmetry eq . ( 7 ) ( cf fig.1 for newtonian fluid and fig . 2 for @xmath32 ) .",
    "one can see that at the mid - channel center plane ( unlike at @xmath33 ) the streamwise velocity power spectrum indicates the same distributed chaos as for newtonian fluid , despite the 30% drag reduction .",
    "however , the 58% drag reduction affects the flow even at the mid - channel center plane .",

    "in previous section we have considered effects of the polymer additives in the _ bulk _ of the channel flow , i.e. outside of the near - wall region with its complex large - scale coherent structures . in a recent dns reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the rayleigh - taylor turbulent convection with a tiny amount of long - chain polymers additives were simulated using a generalization of the boussinesq approximation to a viscoelastic case with the oldroyd - b model ( at prandtl number @xmath34 , low atwood number - @xmath35 , and dilute polymers solution ) .",
    "it is shown that a drag reduction also occurs in the complete absence of walls and results in enhancement of mixing at large scales , in suppression of small - scale fluctuations and , as a consequence , in a considerable enhancement of heat transport .",

    "figure 6 shows analogous power spectrum for the zimm relaxation time @xmath41 .",
    "in turbulent rayleigh - benard convection ( unlike the rayleigh - taylor convection ) there are two distinct flow regions : thermal boundary layers near walls and a bulk region .",
    "these two regions react to the polymer additives in rather different ways . as in the case of the channel flow",
    "we will be interested in the bulk region here .",
    "in a recent experiment , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , effects of tiny polymer additives ( polyacrylimid in water ) on the bulk region were studied in an upright cylindrical convection cell with diameter d=19.3 cm and height h=19.5 cm . for the newtonian case ( without the polymer additives )",

    "this difference results in exponential like eq .",
    "( 1 ) suppression of the small - scale turbulence for the case of the spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry ( section ii ) .",
    "this suppression alone can lead to the observed coherent large - scale mixing enhancement .",
    "this effect is also considerably strengthened by the fact that the range of the distributed chaos is extended into large - scale direction ( smaller wavenumbers @xmath49 ) with the spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry .",
