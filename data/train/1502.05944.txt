    "<S> both by minimizing this function numerically and by evaluating it for randomly chosen transition rates we find that the uncertainty relation @xmath122 is respected . in order to verify whether this result is particular to this network topology </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed six other multicyclic networks , which do not share any particular symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all these networks , our uncertainty relation @xmath56 is fulfilled . in all cases numerical minimization of @xmath101 </S>",
    "<S> leads to a minimum compatible with @xmath102 that is reached in the linear response regime . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> , we conjecture that @xmath56 also for general multicyclic networks beyond linear response .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , for nonequilibrium stationary states we have conjectured the fundamental limit @xmath123 on the minimal dissipation required to generate an output with small relative uncertainty @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this bound can be saturated close to equilibrium with only one independent affinity driving the process . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty relation provides a universal link between the `` precision '' of a molecular machine and the cost of maintaining it . </S>",
    "<S> as one specific application we have shown how a bound on the number of states involved in the enzymatic cycle related to the fano factor can be improved provided the affinity is known . </S>",
    "<S> more broadly , one can expect similar signatures of our fundamental relation quantifying the minimal energetic cost for reaching small uncertainty , i.e. , high precision , to show up in any biochemical or biophysical process at fixed temperature that can be described by a markov network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exploring whether and how this balance between fluctuations and energetics has guided the evolution of chemical reaction networks in living systems constitutes one intriguing perspective of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> our fundamental relationship between minimal dissipated heat and uncertainty is based , first , on exact results in the linear response regime . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have proved it for unicyclic networks arbitrarily far from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> third , for multicyclic networks far from equilibrium we have numerical evidence for several different networks </S>",
    "<S> . we could not provide a formal proof for arbitrary networks , and we expect that the method used for unicyclic networks can not be generalized to multicyclic networks , as it requires an expression for the diffusion coefficient in terms of the transition rates .    on the technical level , investigating possible generalizations of the affinity dependent bound on the fano factor in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ strongerboundfano ] ) to multicyclic networks could lead to further new bounds in statistical kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , it would be interesting to explore whether one can derive bounds involving higher order cumulants . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we emphasize that an algebraic proof of the uncertainty relation in the multicyclic case beyond the linear response regime looks like a serious challenge .    </S>",
