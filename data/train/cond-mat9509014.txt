    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) was introduced by wigner@xcite and dyson@xcite to provide a statistical description of the quantized energy levels of heavy nuclei , and since then it has been applied to a great variety of complex systems , quantum and classical@xcite .",
    "gorkov and eliasheberg@xcite suggested that the wigner - dyson ( wd ) statistics , derived from rmt , could be used to describe the energy levels of small metallic particles at low temperature , in connection with the study of their electromagnetic properties . here",
    "a statistical description is made necessary by the presence of disorder and irregularities in the shape of the particles .",
    "for the case of disordered conductors one can resort to powerful field - theoretical techniques , which have allowed efetov@xcite and altshuler and shklovskii@xcite to show analytically that the wd statistics are more than a simple phenomenological conjecture and describe exactly the local fluctuations of the energy levels in metals in a certain regime .",
    "the wd statistics are characterized by strong energy - level correlations , giving rise to the phenomenon of the level repulsion .",
    "these are the correlations that typically exist among the eigenvalues of a gaussian ensemble ( ge ) of random hermitian matrices @xmath8 , that is , an ensemble of matrices randomly distributed with probability density @xmath9 $ ] .    the ge s ( and therefore the wd statistics ) do not bear any hint of the spatial dimensionality @xmath10 of a physical system .",
    "furthermore , they are , by definition , invariant under similarity transformations and thus there is no basis preference in them .",
    "this means that they can be applied only to particular regimes of a physical system where : 1 ) all the normalized linear combinations of the eigenstates have similar properties ; 2 ) the dimensionality is , in some sense , irrelevant .    for a disordered electronic system",
    "this is just the ergodic regime of the metallic state . in the metallic phase",
    "the eigenstates are extended structurless objects .",
    "if we further assume that all the relevant times are larger than the ergodic time @xmath11,(@xmath12 being the diffusin coefficient ) , any diffusive particle can completely and homogeneously fill the total sample volume @xmath13 during its trajectory ( ergodic regime ) and thus does not feel the space dimensionality .",
    "alternatively , the ergodic time defines a natural energy scale , @xmath14 known as thouless energy . the ergodic regime , and therefore rmt , is valid within energy intervals @xmath15 , or within an interval containing a number of levels @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean level spacing .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is known as the dimensionless conductance in units of @xmath19 . when @xmath20 the level statistics depends on the dimensionality and is different from wd distribution ( altshuler - shklovskii regime ) .",
    "the non - ergodic regime is never reachable in the metallic phase in the thermodynamic limit , in any energy interval containing a large but _ finite _ number of levels , since the dimensionless conductance @xmath18 , diverges in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the wd statistics describe exactly the energy - level correlations of the metallic state in the @xmath22 limit , that exists for @xmath23 at relatively small disorder .    for @xmath24 no metallic state exists in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "if any disorder is present , the system being always an insulator .",
    "for @xmath25 , with disorder increasing , the system goes through the anderson transition@xcite to the insulating state , where all states are localized.@xcite the level statistics in these situations obviously can not be described by the a - dimensional , classical rmt of the ge .",
    "in particular , such simple u(n ) invariant random matrix ensembles ( rme ) can not be an appropriate description of an hamiltonian matrix whose eigenvectors undergo the phenomenon of localization , since one can construct extended states by a linear combination of localized states .",
    "in contrast , the proper @xmath26 distribution should contain eigenvector - eigenvalues correlations or a basis preference that exclude those unitary transformations which would lead to the formation of such extended states .",
    "random banded matrices@xcite are an example of non invariant rme and perhaps more realistic for describing hamiltonians of quasi - onedimensional disordered electronic systems@xcite and other quantum chaotic systems.@xcite their statistical properties exhibit a crossover from the wd to the poisson statistics as a function of the parameter @xmath27 , ( @xmath28 is the band width ) which is similar to what happens in quasi - onedimensional systems upon decreasing the ratio @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the localization length .",
    "while the rmt description of the quasi - onedimensional disordered systems can be provided by random banded matrices , an analogous description of the energy statistics near the critical point for @xmath23 is still missing .",
    "this problem has recently become a very outstanding one , after intense study , both numerical@xcite and analytical,@xcite has shown that the spectral correlations at the metal - insulator transition are also universal and very different form the wd and the poisson statistics .",
    "there is not yet full consensus on the exact nature of the critical energy - level statistics .",
    "the main finding of the analytical treatment based on a scaling analysis@xcite is the existence of a power - law decay of the two - level correlation function with a non trivial critical exponent .",
    "all numerical simulations show that at the critical point the statistical fluctuations of the energy levels are scale invariant .",
    "however while some authors@xcite claim a good agreement of their numerical results with the analytical predictions , others@xcite suggest that the critical statistics constitute more simply a `` hybrid '' between the wd and the poisson distributions without any nontrivial critical exponent .    the search of a rmt description of the critical statistics has prompted the investigation of physically motivated rme which exhibit non trivial deviations from the wd statistics .",
    "one important generalization has been obtained in refs .  [ , ] starting from the ge and introducing a symmetry breaking term of the form @xmath31[{\\bf \\lambda},{\\bf h}]^{\\dagger})}.\\ ] ] the @xmath32-dependent term breaks the @xmath33 invariance and tends to align @xmath8 with a symmetry breaking unitary matrix @xmath34 thus setting the basis preference . it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that even after averaging over @xmath35 the implicit presence of the symmetry breaking term causes a dramatic change in the level correlations of the resulting ensemble , which exhibit a cross - over from the wd to the poisson statistics .",
    "on the other hand , a lot of work@xcite has been devoted to the analysis of @xmath33 invariant generalizations of the ge , of the kind @xmath36    such ensembles arise from a _ global maximum entropy ansatz _ of rmt in which an information entropy is maximized by the distribution.@xcite the function @xmath37 acts like a generalized lagrange multiplier and it is determined , e.g. , by requiring that the density of eigenvalues is some given function @xmath38 , taken directly from the microscopic system being investigated : @xmath39\\rangle = \\rho(\\epsilon)\\ ] ]    for a long time it was believed that the the local statistical properties of the eigenvalues of these ensembles are completely independent of @xmath40 and identical to those of the ge .",
    "this hypothesis , so far supported only by numerical evidence , has been proved more rigorously very recently @xcite for a large class of functions @xmath40 . on the other hand , it has also been demonstrated@xcite that there exists another class of functions @xmath40 , known as _ weak confining potentials _",
    ", for which the eigenvalue statistics display very strong deviations from the universal wd behavior .",
    "such potentials are characterized by a very slow asymptotic growth : @xmath41 it is important to emphasize that this asymptotic behavior of @xmath40 has been inferred from numerical studies of _ random transfer matrix _",
    "models for disordered conductors , through the maximum entropy ansatz.@xcite in that case one considers the eigenvalues of some combination of the transfer matrix , which are directly related to the conductance and become larger and larger , namely less confined , when the disorder increases .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the local eigenvalue fluctuations of the rme with confining potential ( [ dblv ] ) , exibit a cross - over from the wd statistics to a more poisson - like behavior when the parameter @xmath42 is decreased .",
    "since it is a common belief that there is a connection between the statistics of eigenvalues and eigenstates of a rme , this breakdown of the wd universality seems to contradict the argument , ( presented above for the ge ) , that a @xmath33 invariant ensemble can not exhibit poissonian statistics , typical of localized states . in ref .",
    "[ ] it has been suggested that poissonian behavior in such rme is a remarkable phenomenon due to the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath33 symmetry at the transition from a power - law potential , @xmath43 , to the logarithmic potential of eq .",
    "( [ dblv ] ) when @xmath44 . a crucial point in reaching",
    "this conclusion was the observation that the two - level correlation function of the invariant rme with weak confinement and the one of the rme with symmetry breaking are identical in a certain range of the parameters .",
    "having established that these generalized rme with soft confinement belong to a new universality class , characterized by nonclassical correlations that interpolate from the wd to the poisson statistics , there remains the important question of whether or not their properties are related to the critical energy level statistics of the anderson model .    in this paper",
    "we address this question through a careful study of the rme with distribution given by eq .",
    "[ [ phinv ] ] .",
    "firstly we shall show that the local statistical properties of a generalized rme of this sort can be correctly and easily determined using an extension of dyson s functional derivative formalism for the corresponding one dimensional plasma model for the eigenvalues .",
    "this formalism has been used successfully by beenakker@xcite to investigate the random - matrix theory of the transmission eigenvalues in disordered conductors . in particular",
    "we prove that a modified mean field theory ( mft ) of the plasma model is able to yield the nonuniversal asymptotic behavior of the two - level correlation function for weak confinement .",
    "secondly , we perform extensive monte carlo simulations of the onedimensional coulomb plasma of the eigenvalues and calculate all the relevant quantities that describe short - range and long - range statistical properties of the rme .",
    "the comparison with the mft and other analytical results shows that this monte carlo method provides very accurate answers for this problem and can be used to study more complicated rme where no analytical results are known .",
    "finally we critically compare the level statistics of these rme with the the results recently obtained for the @xmath45 anderson model at the metal - insulator transition .",
    "our analysis shows that , while the asymptotic correlations of the rme do not agree with the analytical result of ref .",
    "[ ] , two other statistical properties , namely the distribution function of the level spacings and level number variance , are remarkably close to those found numerically in exact diagonalizations of the anderson model .    the paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ [ sec2 ] ]",
    "we set up formalism and notation and review dyson s derivation of the effective plasma model for the eigenvalue distribution . in section  [ [ sec3:level1 ] ] we develop a mft of this model , generalized to the weak confining potentials .",
    "the mft study of the two - level correlation function is carried out in section  [ [ sec4 ] ] .",

    "in section  [ [ sec6 ] ] we discuss and compare the results of rmt with the the analytical and numerical results of the energy level statistics of the anderson model at the metal - insulator transition .",

    "so far we have considered the correlation functions that probe essentially the local fluctuations of a small number @xmath344 of energy levels .",
    "we now turn to the variance @xmath345 of the number of levels in an energy window that contains @xmath346 on the average .",
    "the number variance is a statistical quantity that provides a quantitative measure of the long - range rigidity of the energy spectrum .    for the poisson distribution the levels",
    "are uncorrelated and there are large level - number fluctuations , leading to a _ linear _ variance @xmath347 on the other hand , the level correlations in the wd statistics makes the spectrum more rigid and the number variance grows only _ logarithmic _",
    "@xmath348    where @xmath349 is a constant of order 1 , which depends on the symmetry .",
    "the mc results for the power - law confinement show that eq .",
    "( [ var_w ] ) is perfectly satisfied , for every @xmath296 , in the bulk , namely when the energy windows does not contain the origin with its nonuniversal correlations . on the other end when the energy windows are centered at the origin ,",
    "the `` super wigner '' correlations present at @xmath89 for @xmath261 , manifest themselves making the constant @xmath349 in the number variance @xmath296 dependent . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , for @xmath58 , @xmath350 decreases with @xmath296 , when @xmath261 , because there is more level repulsion in the area of the origin and therefore more level rigidity in the overall spectrum .",
    "for @xmath136 the universal value of the guassian ensemble @xmath351 , is recovered .",
    "the @xmath296 dependence of @xmath349 is however the only deviation from universality in the number variance , the logarithmic dependence being unchanged for the power - law confinement .",
    "we now come to the case of the logarithmic potential .",
    "we have seen that the presence of the `` ghost '' correlations break translational invariance in the two - point correlation function .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that , due to such a breakdown of translational invariance , the number variance for the double logarithmic confinement depends on the position of the energy window in a very essential way . if the energy window does not contain the origin , then the effect of the ghost peak is not felt and the system is poisson - like , with translationally invariant correlations ( in the energy range considered ) given by eq .",
    "( [ normalr ] ) . in this case",
    "the number variance is also poisson - like and increases _ linearly _ , as one expects in presence of exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term @xmath255 is less than 1 , and it is given by eq .",
    "( [ etad ] ) . here",
    "@xmath255 is nonzero because the normal part alone of the correlation function fails to satisfy the normalization sum rule .",
    "it increases upon decreasing @xmath42 because the `` spectral weight '' of the normal part of the cluster function ( [ y2normdblogpol ] ) decreases .",
    "however , if the energy windows are symmetric with respect to the origin , the ghost correlations become effective and their contribution allow the sum rule to be satisfied . therefore the coefficient of linear term @xmath255 in the variance vanishes in this case .",
    "indeed , the monte carlo simulations show a dramatic difference in the level number variance in these two cases . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the number variance for an energy window centered at a point in the bulk , excluding the origin .",
    "the variance grows linearly and the coefficient of the linear term is in good agreement with eq .",
    "( [ etad ] ) and with the result obtained for the exactly soluble models by blecken _ at al._.@xcite on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the variance calculated for symmetric energy windows , containing the origin .",
    "the linear term is absent and the variance is _ constant _ for all integers @xmath352 .",
    "thus , despite the smaller level repulsion , the overall `` level '' rigidity is even higher that for the classical rmt .",
    "let us first summarize the main results of our analysis of the generalized rmt with soft confinement .",
    "we have seen that for the very weak logarithmic potential , @xmath353 , the local level fluctuations in the bulk of the spectrum display a cross - over from the wd to a more poisson - like behavior , when the parameter @xmath42 is decreased . in particular , the two - level correlation function , in the bulk of the spectrum far from the origin , decays exponentially at large distances .",
    "the spacing distribution function still vanishes like @xmath300 at short separation , but the initial slope is steeper , implying less level repulsion .",
    "the tail of the distribution decays like @xmath354 with @xmath355 , intermediate between the wd surmise and the poisson function .",
    "the level number variance , when calculated within energy windows in the bulk of the spectrum that exclude the origin , is also poissonian , increasing linearly with the the average number of levels @xmath6 .",
    "we saw , however , that the poisson limit can not be reached fully within this ensemble .",
    "the nonuniversal behavior of the rme with logarithmic confining potential has been attributed to a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath33 invariance . for steeper confining potentials , @xmath356 ,",
    "no deviation from the wd statistics occurs in the bulk of the spectrum , the only small deviations from universality occurring at the center.@xcite    the question that now we want to address is : does the non classical ( namely non wd ) behavior of the rme with double logarithmic confinement have anything to do with the universal energy - level statistics of the anderson model at the critical point ?",
    "a first point that needs addressing , before any comparison of the different statistical properties is attempted , is the way in which nonuniversality comes about in the invariant rmt with weak confinement .",
    "we have seen that the essential ingredient to obtain a deviation form the wd statistics is the strong energy dependence of the averaged level density : even in the @xmath81 limit , @xmath115 is a rapidly varying function of @xmath76 everywhere in the spectrum .",
    "in fact one can not even define a constant _ local _ density , since the relative variation of @xmath115 over an energy range equal to the mean level spacing is of order @xmath269 .",
    "this is at odds with the well - known result for the density of states in the anderson model : in that case @xmath38 is constant over a large energy region around the center , and moreover it is a _ noncritical _ quantity , that is , it does not exhibit any drastic change at the critical point .",
    "one can reply to this serious objection by reminding the similarly well - known fact that quite often complex systems with different _ global _ statistical properties ( such the density of levels ) have the same _ local _ level fluctuations.@xcite and _ viceversa_. the most famous example is the ge itself , whose semicircle law for the density of states is certainly not obeyed by any of the spectra of the heavy nuclei or other complex systems ; yet its correlations are very universal and describe accurately the local statistical properties of these systems .",
    "something of this sort might happen in our case . in this respect it is of great importance the existence of another ensemble , namely the broken symmetric model of eq .",
    "( [ she ] ) , where the level density is constant in the thermodynamic limit , and nevertheless the local level correlations are the same of the rme with weak confinement . thus there exist at least two rme , having very different global statistics , whose local statistics belong to the same new universality class .",
    "we also must emphasize again that the asymptotic logarithmic behavior for the confining potential of the invariant rme has been suggested by studies on transfer matrix models of disordered conductors through the maximum entropy principle.@xcite in the transfer matrix formalism one can express the conductance @xmath18 in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath357 of the matrix @xmath358 , where @xmath359 is the transfer matrix and @xmath360 the unit matrix @xmath361 localization appears in the presence of exponentially large eigenvalues @xmath357 .",
    "therefore a simple maximum entropy principle can provide , through the average density @xmath362 , information about the localization of the wavefunctions , in contrast to what happens to the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "here we have assumed that an @xmath33 invariant rmt for the hamiltonian matrix can be constructed from the confining potential derived from the corresponding transfer matrix .",
    "the hope is that such rmt will generate the correct local energy - level statistics , despite the aearge energy density itself will not be well represented.@xcite this procedure is probably too naive , but it is clearly the simplest and we will discuss its implications .",
    "the conjecture of the existence of universal statistical properties at the metal - insulator transition was put forward by shkloskii _",
    "et al._,@xcite on the basis of numerical studies of the spacing distribution function ( lsdf ) which turned out to be scale invariant at the critical point . in a recent work kravtsov _",
    "et al._@xcite have carried out an analytical study of the critical statistics of the anderson model . by using the analytical properties of the diffusion propagator and certain scaling relations valid at the mobility edge",
    "they have proved that the two - level correlation function has the following asymptotic behavior :    @xmath363    where c is a positive constant while @xmath364 is an universal critical exponent related to the critical exponent @xmath365 of the correlation length @xmath30 .",
    "however the level number variance at the critical point contains two terms@xcite @xmath366 where @xmath367 and @xmath28 are some universal positive constants .",
    "the power - law term originates directly from the asymptotic power - law tail in the critical two - level correlator and thus reflects the critical dynamics .",
    "but there is also a _ linear _ term , which had been already predicted by altshuler _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "formally the origin of this term is again due to the violation of the sum rule ( [ etad ] ) , by the critical two - level correlation function .",
    "the physical meaning of this term is not yet understood .",
    "its existence however implies that the dominant term in the variance at the critical point is still poissonian , albei with coefficient less than 1 .",
    "notice that the knowledge of the two - level correlation function is not sufficient to develop a complete statistical description of the energy level at the transition .",
    "for example , the lsdf can not be found without further statistical assumptions . by mapping the critical energy levels into a plasma model and _ assuming _ a the existence of a particular pair - wise interaction@xcite",
    ", one can use the analytical result of eq .",
    "( [ r2_crit ] ) for the two - level correlation function to derive explicitly the effective repulsive interaction among the levels.@xcite .",
    "once the resulting interaction is known the asymptotic form of the lsdf can be evaluated , obtaining the result@xcite @xmath368 where @xmath369 is a positive constant . despite some numerical simulations",
    "seem to support this finding ( but see below ) , this approach has the serious drawback that it gives rise only to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ crit_var ] ) for the level number variance , the linear term being absent and totally unexplained .    following the work by shklovskii",
    "_ , several other groups have studied numerically the energy level statistics at the critical point . in all cases",
    "the statistical fluctuation property that is easiest to study numerically , namely the lsdf , shows scale invariance and a behavior intermediate between the wd surmise and the possion function .",
    "there seems to be agreement also on the linear start of @xmath275 at small @xmath320 , with a slope steeper that the wd function for the metallic regime .",
    "however the large @xmath186 tail behavior is more controversial .",
    "[ , ] claim that @xmath275 has a poissonian decay at large @xmath320 @xmath370 with @xmath371 , wheras refs .",

    "( [ p_klplasma ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the numerical results published in ref .",
    "[ ] explicitly show good statistics for large values of @xmath320 , and therefore we believe that they are reliable to extract the asymptotic behavior of @xmath275 .",
    "the second important result provided by the numerical simulations is the existence of a linear term in the variance , as in eq .",
    "[ [ crit_var ] ] .",
    "these calculations do not exclude the presence of a power - law term of the kind @xmath372 , which is however difficult to detect and quantify because of the presence of the dominant linear term.@xcite .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term is shown to be @xmath373 in ref .  [ ] and @xmath374 in ref .",
    "the rme with weak confinement that we have considered in this paper is able to reproduce two of the main features seen in the numerical simulations of the critical statistics : the overall behavior of @xmath275 with the linear rise at @xmath375 and the exponential decay at @xmath336) and the linear dependence of the number variance . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we plot the lsdf of the rme with logarithmic potential for @xmath376 , together with the critical lsdf of the anderson model from ref .  [ ] .",
    "the agreement between the two curves is spectacular in a very large energy range where @xmath275 varies by five orders of magnitude .",
    "notice in the inset of the figure the behavior for large @xmath320 of the tail of @xmath377 $ ] , which has apparently a linear slope .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 identifies , among all the possible members of the family of rme with logarithmic confinement , the ensemble which has the closest lsdf to the critical statistics .",
    "if we now compute the coefficient @xmath255 of the linear term in the variance for the rme with @xmath3 [ see fig .",
    "fig8 ] , we obtain @xmath378 , which is consistent with the numerical results from the exact diagonalizations.@xcite thus the rme with logarithmic confinement is able to reproduce quantitatively the shape of the critical lsdf when @xmath379 and at the same time provides an accurate estimate of the the leading order term of the number variance . in some sense , the `` residual possonian '' properties of the critical statistics are well reproduced by this generalized rmt .",
    "the rmt does not provide the asymptotic power - law behavior ( [ r2_crit ] ) of the two - level correlation function found analytically , which , on the other hand , is also difficult to extract by direct numerical diagonalizations with reliable accuracy.@xcite clearly more work is necessary to determine if the good agreement shown here between the rme with weak confinement and the critical statistics is more than a furtuitous coincidence .",
    "it is however interesting and important that some of the properties of the correlations at the mobility edge can be correctly reproduced by such a simple ensemble .",
    "in this paper we have studied in detail the properties of families of random matrix ensembles ( rme ) that are invariant under similarity transformations but are characterized by a generalized level confinement .",
    "we have shown that the level statistics are affected by the confining potential when this is very soft .",
    "in particular , for a squared logarithmic potential , the statistical bulk properties are nonuniversal and deviate significantly from the wigner - dyson statistics of the gaussian ensembles , exhibiting a cross - over toward a more poissonian behavior when an internal parameter is decreased . the @xmath33 invariant rme with logarithmic confining potential belongs , together the rme with a symmetry breaking term [ _",
    "see _ eq .",
    "( [ she ] ) ] , to a new universality class , distinct from wigner - dyson universality of classical rmt .",
    "the statistical properties of the rme with logarithmic confinement have strong similarities with the universal energy level statistics of disordered conductors at the metal - insulator transition .",
    "in particular , the probability distribution of the level spacings for a three dimensional anderson model at the critical point can be very well fitted , throughout a wide energy range , by the corresponding rme function for one particular choice of the internal parameter .",
    "then for the _ same _ value of the parameter , this rme predicts a linear behavior for the level number variance , with a coefficient of proportionality close to the value obtained from numerical diagonalizations of the anderson model at the critical point .",
