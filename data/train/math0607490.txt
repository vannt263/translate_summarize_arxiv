    "both the author @xcite and paolo salvatore @xcite have constructed actions of the operad of little @xmath0-cubes on the ` framed ' long knot spaces @xmath1 defined in @xcite which extend the homotopy - associative product given by the connect - sum operation .",
    "computations of the homotopy - type @xcite and homology @xcite of @xmath2 suggest in several ways ( some more vague than others ) that the spaces @xmath1 may admit an action of the operad of framed little @xmath0-discs . a concrete example : provided",
    "such an action exists , it would allow for a more compact and ` operadic ' description of the homotopy - type of @xmath2 than the one given in @xcite .",
