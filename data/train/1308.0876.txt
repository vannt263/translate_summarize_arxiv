    "mergers of double neutron stars ( nss ) or a ns with a stellar - mass black hole are the primary targets of direct detections of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "it is expected that , by the end of this decade , the second generation of ground - based gw detectors would extend the detection horizons of the mergers to a few hundred mpcs or even 1 gpc ( abadie et al .",
    "2010 ; nissanke et al .",
    "electromagnetic ( em ) transients that are spatially and temporally coincident with the gw bursts due to the mergers could play a crucial role in the discovery and identification of the gw signals by providing position , time , redshift , and astrophysical properties of the sources .",
    "the brightest em emission during the compact binary mergers is probably short - duration gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ; e.g. gehrels et al . 2005 ; fox et al . 2005 ; fong et al .",
    "2013 ; cf .",
    "virgili et al .",
    "however , since they are usually beamed into a small opening angle ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2006 ; de pasquale et al . 2010 ) , most gw bursts would not be detected together with sgrbs ( e.g. metzger & berger 2012 ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that a more isotropic , sub - relativistic ( @xmath0 ) outflow could be ejected during a merger , which could include the tidal tail matter during the merger and the matter from the accretion disk ( e.g. rezzolla et al .",
    "2011 ; bauswein et al . 2013",
    "; rosswog et al .",
    "the typical mass of the ejecta is in the range @xmath1 ( hotokezaka et al .",
    "somewhat higher mass could also exist ( fan et al .",
    "the ejecta is expected to be neutron - rich and thus heavier radioactive elements could be synthesized via r - process .",
    "li & paczynski ( 1998 ) suggested that the ejecta could produce a thermal uv - optical transient powered by radioactive decay , which is more isotropic than sgrbs . in the past few years , much effort has been invested in determining the details of merger dynamics , nuclear synthesis , radiative transfer , etc ( e.g. , kulkarni 2005 ; rosswog 2005 ; metzger et al .",
    "2010 ; goriely et al .",
    "2011 ; roberts et al . 2011 ; barnes & kasen 2013 ; bauswein et al . 2013 ; grossman et al . 2013 ; piran et al . 2013 ; rosswog et al .",
    "2013 ; takami et al . 2013 ; tanaka & hotokezaka 2013 ) .",
    "the interaction between the merger ejecta and the ambient medium is also expected to produce a long - lasting afterglow emission ( nakar & piran 2011 ; metzger & berger 2012 ; piran et al . 2013 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the brightness of the afterglow emission is typically low , and strongly depends on the ambient density .    the merger products are usually considered to be a black hole .",
    "alternatively , given the uncertainties of nuclear matter equation - of - state and ns mass distributions of the merger systems , it is possible that at least some ns - ns mergers would leave behind a stable ( for hours to days ) , rapidly rotating ns ( e.g. dai et al .",
    "2006 ; fan & xu 2006 ; zhang 2013 ; giacomazzo & perna 2013 ) .",
    "this is indirectly supported by the fact that some sgrbs are followed by an x - ray plateau with an abrupt ending , which is best interpreted as emission from a spinning down magnetar ( e.g. rowlinson et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ) . more directly , the present lower limit of the maximum mass of galactic nss is precisely set by psr j0348 + 0432 to @xmath2 ( antoniadis et al .",
    "the permitted equations of state usually lead to a maximum mass close to or higher than @xmath3 for a non - rotating ns , which is comparable to the sum of the masses of some galactic ns - ns binaries .",
    "zhang ( 2013 ) proposed that if a ns - ns merger leaves behind a millisecond magnetar , a gw burst would be associated with a bright x - ray early afterglow due to magnetar wind dissipation , regardless of whether there is an associated sgrb .",
    "gao et al . ( 2013 ) studied the multi - wavelength afterglows of such a magnetar - powered merger ejecta .    following the above consideration",
    ", we suggest in this letter that the magnetar wind would first heat up the neutron - rich merger ejecta before powering its afterglow and consequently produce a bright  merger - nova \" times than the eddington luminosity . in this letter",
    ", we use a more general word  merger - nova \" to reflect a wider range of predicted luminosities . ]",
    ". a similar process could have been observed in the so - called superluminous supernovae ( kasen & bildsten 2010 ) , the light curves of which can be explained by having a millisecond magnetar wind heating the ejecta more than radioactive processes ( inserra et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this letter",
    ", we develop a dynamic model for the evolution of the merger ejecta including acceleration , coasting , and deceleration .",
    "we then study the emission properties of the millisecond - magnetar - powered merger - nova and the follow - up broad - band afterglows ( see also gao et al .",
    "these predicted em signals can serve as interesting targets for in search for em counterparts of gw burst triggers in the upcoming advanced ligo / virgo era .",
    "for a millisecond magnetar of an initial spin period @xmath4 , its total rotational energy reads @xmath5 .",
    "hereafter the convention @xmath6 is adopted in cgs units . with a dipolar magnetic field of strength @xmath7 , the spin - down luminosity of the millisecond magnetar as a function of time",
    "may be expressed by the magnetic dipole radiation formula @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is time in the observer s frame .",
    "based on the derived magnetar parameters by fitting the sgrb x - ray plateau feature ( rowlinson et al .",
    "2013 ) and fitting the superluminous supernovae ( inserra et al . 2013 ) , we adopt the following parameters as reference values : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which give @xmath14 and @xmath15 s , where a relatively large stellar radius @xmath16 is adopted by considering a rapidly rotating supra - massive ns .",
    "the magnetar wind runs into the essentially isotropic ejecta with an ultra - relativistic speed and is quickly decelerated by the ejecta . at the same time , the injected wind continuously pushes from behind and accelerate the ejecta . a forward",
    "shock crosses the ejecta within seconds ( gao et al .",
    "2013 ) , after which it propagates into the interstellar medium . since the ejecta is `` sandwiched '' between the forward shock and the magnetar wind , its internal energy steadily increases ( heats up ) as the forward shock speed increases .",
    "the wind energy could be deposited into the ejecta either via direct energy injection by a poynting flux ( bucciantini et al . 2012 ) , or due to heating from the bottom by the photons generated in a dissipating magnetar wind via forced reconnection , as the wind is decelerated by the ejecta ( e.g. zhang 2013 ) .",
    "the latter process can be efficient , which would give rise to a relatively large efficiency @xmath17 ( for which we take a nominal value 0.3 , zhang & yan 2011 ) of injecting spin - down luminosity to the ejecta .",
    "the heating process continues until the supra - massive magnetar collapses to a black hole at @xmath18 , which could not be much longer than @xmath19 after which the star remarkably is spun down and loses a significant centrifugal support . in principle , a smaller collapsing time could be expected if some other spin - down mechanisms ( e.g. , gravitational radiation ) act earlier .",
    "an obvious difference between a merger - nova and a supernova would be their distinct ejecta masses .",
    "we use @xmath20 to define a critical ejecta mass as @xmath21 , below which the ejecta can be accelerated to a relativistic speed by the magnetar wind ( gao et al .",
    "the predicted range of the ejecta masses , @xmath22 , indicates that a complete description of the dynamical evolution of a merger - nova , which covers both the non - relativistic and high - relativistic phases , is desirable .",
    "the total energy of the ejecta excluding the rest energy can be expressed by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lorentz factor and @xmath25 is the internal energy measured in the comoving rest frame .",
    "energy conservation gives @xmath26 , where a fraction @xmath17 of the spin - down luminosity is assumed to be injected into the ejecta , @xmath27 is the radioactive power , and @xmath28 is the radiated bolometric luminosity .",
    "the dynamic evolution of the ejecta can be determined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] is the doppler factor with @xmath31 .",
    "the comoving time @xmath32 can be connected with the observer s time by @xmath33 .",
    "the variation of the internal energy in the comoving frame can be expressed by ( e.g. kasen & bildsten 2010 ) @xmath34 where the comoving luminosities read @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37^{1.3}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 s and @xmath39 s ( korobkin et al .",
    "2012 ) . for typical parameters @xmath40 unless the magnetar only lives for a few hundred seconds .",
    "@xmath41 represents the work due to free expansion of the ejecta which converts internal energy into bulk kinetic energy .",
    "the pressure @xmath42 is dominated by radiation , and the evolution of the comoving volume can be determined by @xmath43 together with @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radius of the ejecta .",
    "the radiated bolometric luminosity can be derived approximately from the diffusion equation in the comoving frame ( kasen & bildsten 2010 ; kotera et al . 2013 ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the optical depth of the ejecta with @xmath48 being the opacity is adopted for simplicity , which is appropriate for electron scattering in a plasma with an ionization degree of 0.5 . however , for r - process elements , kasen et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found that the bound - bound , bound - free , and free - free transitions could provide more important contributions to the opacity , which makes the opacity higher and strongly energy - dependent .",
    "as a result , the merger - nova emission could be extended , weakened , and shifted towards softer bands ( barnes & kasen 2013 ) .",
    "additionally , the ionization of the ejecta by the wind x - ray emission ( zhang 2013 ) could also affect the opacity .",
    "] , @xmath49 is the effective diffusion time , and @xmath50 is the time at which @xmath51 .",
    "we note that the optical depth reads @xmath52 when @xmath53 , which suggests that @xmath54 all the time , similar to the non - relativistic case ( kasen & bildsten 2010 ) .",
    "numerical solutions to the above equations are presented in fig . 1 for two ejecta masses , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where the magnetar collapse effect is not included .",
    "for the low mass case , the dynamical transition from the non - relativistic regime to the mildly - relativistic regime is clearly shown in the top panel .",
    "the acceleration time of the ejecta is determined by the spin - down timescale @xmath19 in all the situations .",
    "the optical depth and the diffusion time play a crucial role in determining the temporal behavior of the merger - nova emission . as @xmath57 and",
    "the ratio @xmath58 gradually drop towards unity , the bolometric light curve rises and finally reaches a peak at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , or @xmath19 ( i.e. the ejecta photosphere ) . to be specific , for a high - mass ejecta , the peak time @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( e.g. , the case of superluminous supernova ) and @xmath63 for @xmath64 ( e.g. , the case of @xmath65 in fig .",
    "1 ) , which were analytically proved by kasen & bildsten ( 2010 ) and dexter & kasen ( 2013 ) . in contrast , since a low - mass ejecta could become optically thin before @xmath19 , the emission would monotonously decrease after @xmath60 even though there is further energy injection .",
    "so for @xmath66 ( e.g. , the case of @xmath67 in fig .",
    "1 ) , the luminosity peak could appear at @xmath60 .",
    "1 shows that the peak time of merger - novae could range from hours ( low @xmath68 case ) to @xmath69 a day ( high @xmath68 case ) .",
    "after @xmath70 , the bolometric luminosity starts to decrease and the decrease rate approximately track the spin - down luminosity at @xmath71 .",
    "the peak energy of the emission spectrum @xmath72 can be characterized by the blackbody temperature , specifically @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath75 the radiation constant . as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 , the blackbody peak of the photosphere emission mostly falls into the @xmath76 ev energy band for the adopted parameters . for an observational frequency @xmath77",
    ", the luminosity light curve can be calculated as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the planck constant .",
    "the light curves at different frequencies ( 1 ev , 30 ev , 1 kev ) of the millisecond - magnetar - powered merger - novae are presented in fig .",
    "2 . for nominal parameters",
    ", the emission mainly occurs in the uv band with a peak luminosity around @xmath80 . higher - energy ( e.g. x - ray ) emission peaks earlier and the corresponding luminosity decreases significantly ( due to the exponential tail of thermal emission ) with increasing photon energy . in the optical band ( @xmath81 ev )",
    ", a luminous flash with a peak luminosity of @xmath82 appears in the day to week time scale .",
    "this was the reason why we did not adopt the word ",
    "macro - nova \" or  kilo - nova \" .",
    "nevertheless , such a bright optical emission could be significantly suppressed by an early collapse of the magnetar ( @xmath83 ) due to an extra angular momentum loss ( e.g. via strong gravitational radiation ) , as shown by the dotted lines in fig . 2 for an optionally taken @xmath84 s. of course , in a more detailed calculation , the influence on the spin down behavior of the extra angular momentum loss before this collapsing time",
    "should also be taken into account ( fan et al .",
    "2013 ) . for a direct impression of the merger - nova optical emission , in figure 3 we present the optical light curve of the magnetar - powered merger - nova in linear time scale , in comparison with the bolometric light curves of two supernovae ( sn 1998bw and sn 2006gy ) and a light curve of radioactive merger - nova ( eqs .",
    "[ gamma ] and [ eint ] without the magnetar term ) .",
    "as shown , the lifetime of the magnetar plays a crucial role to determine the brightness and duration of the merger - nova optical emission .",
    "for a full dynamical description of the system , here we consider the deceleration of the merger ejecta by sweeping up the ambient medium ( see also gao et al .",
    "the treatment is similar to the generic dynamic model for grb afterglow ( huang et al .",
    "1999 ) , but with continuous energy injection from the magnetar ( dai & lu 1998a , b ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .",
    "the total energy of the ejecta and shocked medium can be expressed as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the mass of the swept up medium , and the comoving internal energy of the shocked medium is @xmath87 according to the shock jump condition .",
    "the energy conservation law gives @xmath88 where the energy loss due to shock emission is ignored , an approximation usually adopted in grb afterglow modeling .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , for a reasonable range of the ambient density , deceleration could not start before acceleration is completed .",
    "therefore , the acceleration and deceleration processes can be in principle investigated independently , as treated in section 2 .",
    "the light curves of the afterglow synchrotron emission for a typical ambient density @xmath89 are presented in figure 2 along with the merger - nova light curves . as shown",
    ", the afterglow emission could be much weaker than that of the merger - nova in a wide frequency range , although a noteworthy fraction of the injected energy is also transferred to the shock .",
    "by describing the dynamic evolution of a merger ejecta powered by a millisecond magnetar , we calculate the thermal emission of the merger - nova and the non - thermal emission of the external shock .",
    "the optical brightness of the millisecond - magnetar - powered merger - nova is found to be comparable to or even higher than that of supernovae , which is a few tens or hundreds times brighter than the radioactive - powered kilo - novae , if the magnetar remains stable before @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , early gw loss and an earlier collapsing time could suppress the optical emission significantly . the magnetar collapse due to losing most centrifugal support",
    "could also restrict the duration of the mergernova within the order of ( at most ) a few days , which is considerably shorter than the supernovae duration lasting months and years .",
    "detecting such a unique em transient associated with a gw burst would unambiguously confirm the astrophysical origin of the gw burst and robustly suggest a massive millisecond magnetar formed during the merger .",
    "so far , no bright optical merger - nova was detected in association with sgrbs .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "along the spin axis , a strong magnetar jet could breaks out by propelling ejecta sideways ( bucciantini et al .",
    "2012 ; quataert & kasen 2012 ) , so that there could be no merger - nova emission toward the observer in the sgrb direction .",
    "a bright merger - nova may still be observable in the equatorial direction , but it is relativistically doppler de - boosted in the direction of the sgrb .",
    "we expect that bright merger - nova tend to be discovered in ns - ns mergers without a sgrb association",
    ".    for the detectability of the millisecond - magnetar - powered mergernovae , a detailed monte carlo simulation could be desirable . here",
    "we give a rough estimate .",
    "in the survey mode , the detection efficiency of merger - novae by an optical telescope may be estimated by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is redshift , @xmath92 is the merger - nova duration above the detector sensitivity limit , @xmath93 is the exposure time , @xmath94 is the field of view of the telescope .",
    "the detection rate of millisecond - magnetar - powered bright optical merger - novae without a sgrb association may be estimated as @xmath95^{3/2}\\eta f\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 0.06 ( 1+z)^{-2}l_{\\rm mn , 42.7}^{3/2}s_{-13.7}^{-3/2}\\eta_{-4}f_{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left({\\dot{\\rho}_{_{\\rm ns - ns}}\\over 500\\rm gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}\\right)\\rm yr^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the ns - ns merger rate density normalized to beaming - corrected sgrb rate density , @xmath97 is the merger - nova luminosity , @xmath98 is the telescope sensitivity which is normalized to a v - band magnitude @xmath99 and should strongly depend on the exposure time , and @xmath100 is the fraction of ns - ns mergers that give rise to a millisecond magnetar .",
    "one can see that the short duration of the merger - novae ( small @xmath101 ) could make them easily to evade from the current supernova surveys , even though they are very luminous",
    ". a shorter lifetime of the magnetar ( e.g. due to strong gravitational radiation ) would reduce @xmath97 and @xmath102 , which lead to a lower observed event rate of the optical merger - novae .",
    "future wide - field optical telescope surveys ( e.g. the ground - based wide - angle camera array , gwac ) would detect these events or pose important constraints on the unknown parameters such as @xmath96 , @xmath101 , and @xmath100 .    finally ,",
    "while this letter only focuses on the effect of energy injection into the merger ejecta , a large fraction of the spin - down luminosity carried in the magnetar wind could be dissipated directly .",
    "the internal dissipation may arise from turbulent magnetic reconnection due to internal collisions of the magnetar wind ( zhang & yan 2011 ) or from the termination shock of the wind ( dai 2004 ) .",
    "these internal dissipations could produce an emission typically in a higher energy band , e.g. in x - rays ( yu et al .",
    "2010 ; zhang 2013 ) .",
    "this x - ray transient is also expected to ionize the entire ejecta , similar to the case of superluminous supernovae ( metzger et al .",
