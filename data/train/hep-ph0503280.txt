    "the production of electroweak gauge bosons , which decay leptonically , is one of the most prominent examples for hard processes at hadron colliders and one of the first applications of perturbative qcd in such reactions .",
    "in fact , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to this process in qcd , calculated by @xcite provided the first calculation of such corrections for hadron collisions .",
    "later , their production cross section has been calculated at nnlo by @xcite .",
    "recently , the first distribution determined at nnlo related to these processes , namely the boson rapidity , has been calculated by @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a large number of computer programs dealing with single gauge boson production .",
    "they range from resbos @xcite , which resums soft gluon effects in these processes , to codes , that evaluate cross sections at the lo level for the production of gauge bosons accompanied by jets .",
    "examples for the latter include specialised ones , such as vecbos @xcite , and general ones , usually called parton level generators , such as comphep @xcite , grace / gr@ppa @xcite , madgraph / madevent @xcite , alpgen @xcite , and amegic++ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the first package called mcfm has been made available that calculates total and differential cross sections at nlo precision for the production of gauge bosons with up to two jets @xcite .",
    "this reflects the importance of this particular process . at the lhc becoming operational in the near future",
    ", the gauge bosons will be produced with unprecedented rates .",
    "for instance , at luminosities of @xmath0 the production and leptonic decay of a single @xmath1 boson will occur with a frequency of around 20 hz , rendering this process a prime candidate for luminosity monitoring @xcite .",
    "of course , these large rates will allow to measure the gauge bosons parameters , such as their masses and widths , with a precision @xcite beyond what could be reached at previous collider experiments @xcite . at the cern lhc",
    ", the production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons together with jets also constitute an important background to all kinds of searches for new physics , such as supersymmetry .",
    "an example for this is the production and decay of gluinos , where the production of jets plus a @xmath2 boson decaying into neutrinos forms a major background .    in a previous analysis @xcite",
    "it has been shown that some results for this type of process , i.e.  the production of single gauge bosons plus extra jets , as obtained by other multi - purpose event generators such as pythia @xcite , herwig @xcite or even mc@nlo @xcite differ significantly from the results obtained by sherpa  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that already at the fermilab tevatron , operating at roughly 2 tev centre - of - mass energy , the additional jets are produced at significantly larger transverse momenta .",
    "the reason for this difference is the way the different codes implement the knowledge of exact matrix elements for the production of multi - particle final states . in both , pythia and herwig ,",
    "they are included at first order in @xmath3 through a correction of the first hard emission on the corresponding @xmath4 or @xmath5 matrix element , where @xmath6 stands for the vector boson @xcite . in mc@nlo",
    "the full first order correction , including both , the virtual and the real parts , are matched with the parton shower .",
    "this has the additional benefit that mc@nlo reproduces correctly the total production rate of single gauge bosons and the spectrum of the first additional jet at first order in @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , in sherpa  a method has been implemented that consistently adds different matrix elements at the tree level for different jet multiplicities and merges them with the parton shower .",
    "the basic idea in this approach is to internally define a region of jet production ( hard parton emissions ) and a region of jet evolution ( soft parton emissions ) .",
    "the two regimes are divided by a @xmath7-type of jet measure @xcite . leading higher order effects",
    "are incorporated by reweighting the matrix elements with appropriate sudakov form factors .",
    "formal independence at leading logarithmic order of the overall result on the jet measure is achieved by suitable starting conditions and vetoing hard emissions inside the parton shower .",
    "this approach was presented for the first time @xcite for @xmath8 collisions ; it has been extended to hadronic collisions in @xcite .",
    "a reformulation for dipole cascades has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is implemented in a fully automated way and in full generality in sherpa , some other realisations @xcite proved the flexibility and the validity of the approach .    in this publication",
    ", the previous analysis @xcite will be extended to the case of the cern lhc , operating in the @xmath9 mode at 14 tev centre - of - mass energy . in sec .",
    "[ consistency_sec ] , a number of consistency checks will focus on the independence of the results on variations of the internal jet definition and of the number of matrix elements involved . also , the effect of scale variations in both the matrix elements and the parton shower is investigated there .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ compare_nlo_sec ] , results obtained with sherpa  will be contrasted to those obtained from fixed order ( lo and nlo ) calculations provided by mcfm . following this ,",
    "different multi - purpose event generators , namely pythia , mc@nlo and sherpa , will be compared in sec .",
    "[ compare_mc_sec ] , before the conclusions will summarise the findings .",
    "before comparing the results of sherpa  with those of other programs , some consistency checks will be performed .",
    "to do so , the dependence of some observables in reactions of the type @xmath10 on internal parameters intrinsic for the merging procedure will be investigated .",
    "in particular , these parameters are the internal jet resolution cut @xmath11 and the maximal number @xmath12 of final state partons ( giving rise to jets ) described through matrix elements .",
    "the former parameter defines the transition of the matrix element domain to the phase space region covered by the parton shower during event generation . in principle , the actual value of this parameter can be chosen freely , nevertheless their exist criteria that guide such a choice .",
    "for very low values of @xmath11 the evaluation of the matrix elements becomes very challenging and potentially inefficient once jet cuts are performed on the analysis level harder than the generation cut @xmath11 .",
    "the upper limit is defined by the scale where jets produced by the parton shower start to disagree significantly from such produced by equivalent matrix elements . to study especially the effect of the upper limit",
    ", the values used in this analysis will range over nearly one order of magnitude , from 15 to 100 gev .",
    "the choice of the number of matrix element partons taken into account may be steered by two aspects .",
    "first of all , @xmath12 has to be sufficiently large to properly account for the phase space region the observable under consideration is sensitive to . as an example , consider the transverse momentum of the boson compared to that of the , say , third jet .",
    "it is obvious that a rather inclusive quantity such as the former may be appropriately described with lower values of @xmath12 than the latter observable . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit on @xmath12 is given by the availability of the matrix elements at all and by the potentially large amount of cpu time the evaluation of multi - leg matrix elements requires . within sherpa  matrix elements with up to four extra partons",
    "can be delivered for the processes under consideration in this publication . after evaluating the sensitivity of the results on the principal parameters defining the merging procedure , @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", the effect of scale variations will be investigated .",
    "this , together with the dependence on @xmath11 and @xmath12 yields an estimate for the uncertainty related to predictions of sherpa .",
    "the results presented in this section were generated with the following setups : when varying the jet resolution parameter @xmath11 , the maximal number of final state partons @xmath12 has been set to @xmath13 . when studying the impact of different matrix element multiplicities , the scale @xmath11 has been fixed to @xmath14 gev ; this clearly maximises the impact of the higher order matrix elements .",
    "when scale variations are under consideration , the choice @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 has been made .    in the following , @xmath2-boson production will be investigated in more detail .",
    "nevertheless , the process under consideration is @xmath17 , where the full @xmath18-@xmath2 interference is taken into account and spin correlations are fully respected .",
    "further input parameters used and the phase space cuts applied are summarised in the appendix [ appendix ] . note that the cut on the invariant mass of the lepton pair is just @xmath19 which is rather small .",
    "the description of such low mass lepton pairs constitutes a real challenge for the description through the merging prescription .",
    "the reason is that at large @xmath20 , lepton pairs with such low invariant mass clearly are softer than any jet produced through the matrix element , rendering a consistent merging a complicated task .",
    "starting from more inclusive observables , first of all the effect of parameter variation on lepton observables will be considered . in fig .",
    "[ ycut_pt ] , the @xmath21 spectra of both the lepton pair ( upper row ) and of the electron alone ( lower row ) are shown for three different values of @xmath11 : from left to right , in the columns @xmath22 gev , as indicated by the thin vertical lines . in each plot , the resulting spectrum is compared to a reference obtained from averaging the results for @xmath23 gev . in this and all other plots , contributions stemming from the different matrix element multiplicities",

    "it is the smallest cut considered here and therefore the distributions are dominated by matrix elements that in contrast to the parton shower favour rather hard parton kinematics .",
    "for very high @xmath21 the distributions are almost completely covered by the matrix element with the highest multiplicity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this shows that the lhc provides enough phase space to produce a sufficient amount of events with three and more jets of @xmath24 .",
    "for the case of @xmath25 gev the situation is slightly different .",
    "the high-@xmath21 tail is filled to an equal amount by the different multiplicities , the total sum being slightly below the reference curve .",
    "this reference curve contains three results with jet resolutions smaller than @xmath26 gev that somehow dominate the averaged result .",

    ", one has to remember that the boson transverse momentum for values below the resolution cut is almost completely covered by the parton shower . the shower description ,",
    "however , is known to suffer from a lack of hard qcd radiation .",
    "this leaves not enough hard partons , the boson can recoil against . beyond this influence of the @xmath11 variation on the intermediate and high boson transverse momenta",
    ", it has to be noted that all curves are very smooth around the jet resolution cut .",

    "the differences in the @xmath31 distribution of the lepton pair can be understood easily : the smaller the chosen cut , the larger the influence of the matrix elements with extra external legs .",
    "these matrix elements however prefer to produce the boson much more central than the parton shower does .",
    "this effect yields slightly tighter spectra with the central rapidities being pronounced for smaller resolution cuts .",
    "( 400,295 ) ( 250,145 ) ( 125,145 ) ( 0,145 ) ( 250,0 ) ( 125,0 ) ( 0,0 )    the effect of varying @xmath12 on the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity spectrum of the lepton pair is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ nmax_pt ] . in this figure ,",
    "results are compared for @xmath32 . in each plot ,",
    "a reference result is given with the corresponding @xmath33 .",
    "for the case of the @xmath21 distribution it has already been observed that the high-@xmath21 region is described through higher multiplicity matrix elements . as a consequence ,",
    "it is the high-@xmath21 region that is affected by the variation of @xmath12 .",
    "however , while the effect is clearly noticeable when going from one to two extra partons the change becomes smaller the more matrix elements are included . from the very right plot",
    "one can conclude that considering @xmath34 extra parton matrix elements is a reasonable choice to simulate inclusive @xmath2 production .",
    "the change in the @xmath31 distribution for different @xmath12 is as expected , considering what has already been seen for varying the jet resolution .",
    "the higher multiplicity matrix elements favour the region of small @xmath35 yielding slightly tighter pseudo - rapidity distributions . again",
    ", the more matrix elements have been taken into account the smaller the influence when adding an even higher multiplicity .    in comparison to what has been observed when studying gauge boson production at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , the lhc provides much more phase space for additional hard qcd radiation , enhancing the influence of higher order matrix elements .",
    "therefore a modest value of the jet resolution parameter and the inclusion of a sufficient large number of matrix element legs is advisable for lhc analyses .",

    "in particular , differential jet rates have turned out to be very useful , since they clearly show how the matrix elements and the parton showers interact in filling the phase space below and above the jet resolution cut . in fig .",

    "starting the discussion with the results for @xmath44 gev , very good agreement with the reference curves can be observed . while the @xmath45 transition is very smooth around the cut the results for @xmath46 and @xmath47 exhibit small dips at the cut scale .",
    "since the kinematics of the matrix elements is altered when the parton shower is attached , mismatches of the parton configurations close to the cut occur , leading to the dips .",
    "similar structures can be observed for the case of @xmath27 gev .",
    "however , more obvious here is that the parton shower fails to fill the phase space for hard emissions up to this very large cut . for @xmath14 gev no visible dips at the cut scale are observed .",
    "instead , this sample seems to slightly overestimate the contributions from higher order matrix elements w.r.t the reference .",
    "a small kink at @xmath11 can be observed for the @xmath41 and @xmath47 transition .",
    "these residual dependences of the results on @xmath11 may be used to tune the perturbative part of the monte carlo event generator .",

    "the smallest value of @xmath11 presented here , namely @xmath51 gev , is smaller than the actual jet cut used in the analysis .",
    "accordingly , matrix elements with more than one extra leg have a non - vanishing influence on the jet-@xmath21 distribution .",

    "[ ycut_pt ] , for @xmath27 gev , the shower is not able to fill the full phase space below the cut properly . however , the overall agreement of the three results is satisfactory , keeping in mind the large parameter range used for @xmath11 .",

    "the algorithm as implemented in sherpa  determines the renormalisation and factorisation scales used in a specific calculation .",
    "of course there is some intrinsic freedom in defining the scales used for the evaluation of the pdf or the strong coupling constant .",
    "in particular , the scales used can be multiplied by constant factors , as long as this alteration is applied both in the matrix element evaluation and reweighting and in the parton shower .",
    "this restriction is due to the construction of how the leading logarithmic dependence on @xmath11 is eliminated .",
    "the dependence of the sherpa  results with respect to such scale variations is studied in fig .",

    "[ scale_change2 ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]         for the hardest jet the predictions of mc@nlo and sherpa  agree rather well .",
    "the total rate of sherpa  is @xmath59 smaller than that predicted by mc@nlo , the distribution , however , has a slightly harder tail .",
    "this difference in rate can be traced back to the different inclusive production cross sections . however , for @xmath16 , the two total cross sections of @xmath48jet nearly coincide ( cf .",
    "the dashed black curve in fig .  [ z_jet12_pt_mc_full ] ) . in terms of shape ,",
    "sherpa  apparently favours jets with larger transverse momentum .",
    "as has been seen in the closely related boson @xmath21 distribution in fig .",
    "[ z_pt_eta_mc ] , pythia predicts a much smaller rate ( 60% w.r.t .  the rate predicted by mc@nlo ) for the production of extra hard qcd radiation with a softer distribution .",
    "for the second jet the situation changes significantly . here ,",
    "even in the case of including only matrix elements with up to one extra parton the two - jet rate predicted by sherpa  is @xmath60 larger than that of mc@nlo .",
    "including matrix elements with two extra partons the difference becomes nearly @xmath61 .",
    "as for the case of the first jet , pythia predicts the radiation of a second jet with a much smaller rate .",
    "similar statements hold true when looking at the third jet but this time the differences are even larger .",
    "note , that a reliable prediction of the three jet rate requires the inclusion of matrix elements with at least three extra partons . while the sample with matrix elements up to one extra parton predicts a three jet rate of @xmath62 pb , the samples with two ( three ) extra partons predict @xmath63 pb .",
    "however , this is not surprising keeping in mind that the lhc provides enough phase space to produce massive bosons in association with a multitude of high energetic jets that are best described by the corresponding matrix elements and that can not be appropriately described by parton shower emissions .    to summarize : the predictions of mc@nlo and sherpa  agree fairly well for the shape of the boson transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity distribution . here",
    ", mc@nlo is of course superior in predicting the rate of inclusive @xmath64 and @xmath1 production since it considers the corresponding production process at nlo in the coupling constant .",
    "this situation changes when studying the jets that potentially accompany the boson .",
    "as soon as more than one extra jet is considered sherpa  predicts significantly larger jet production rates and jet transverse momentum distributions that feature an enhanced population of the high-@xmath21 region .",
    "concerning pythia it has to be stated that the shape of the boson transverse momentum and the boson pseudo - rapidity distribution differ significantly from the two other programs .",
    "this is directly related to the smaller amount of hard radiation produced by pythia , clearly observed in the jet @xmath21 spectra .",
    "in this publication , the previous validation of the merging procedure of matrix elements and the parton shower , as implemented in sherpa , has been continued .",
    "again , processes of the type @xmath65 , where @xmath66 have been chosen ; this time , however , the analysis focused on the case of the cern lhc rather than on the fermilab tevatron .",
    "again , the merging procedure turned out to yield sufficiently stable results over a wide range of internal parameters , rendering it a predictive way of incorporating the full information available in tree - level matrix elements into multi - purpose event generators , as anticipated .",
    "in addition , when comparing the results obtained through sherpa  with those of a full next - to - leading order calculation , it again turned out that the results of sherpa  reproduce the essential features in the nlo shapes . however , it should be stressed that in sherpa  the total rates are still at leading order accuracy only .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that sherpa  seems to reproduce the nlo shapes of the observables , the nlo rates can be recovered by simply multiplying with a constant @xmath67-factor . when comparing the results of sherpa  with those of other event generators , some differences appear . especially for observables sensitive to the correct treatment of multi - particle final states these differences have become significant , ranging up to orders of magnitude .    in this study ,",
    "sherpa  again proved its versatility in simulating high - multiplicity final states at collider experiments .",
    "due to the merging procedure implemented in it , it provides a unique tool for the simulation of final states , where the proper treatment of the event topology is of great importance .",
