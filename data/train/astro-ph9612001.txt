    "it was suggested a long time ago ( shvartsman 1970 ; michel 1972 ; anile , & treves 1972 ; maraschi , reina , & treves 1974 ) that accretion of a hydrogen plasma onto a neutron star must necessarily imply the presence of an electrostatic field @xmath2 under stationary conditions .",
    "the field @xmath2 arises because the radiation drag , due to the outflowing flux , acts efficiently only on electrons while practically all the mass is in protons .",
    "the electrostatic field compensates the different acceleration of the two species and allows electrons and protons to move at the same speed .",
    "obviously @xmath2 is stronger the larger is the deviation from free  fall , a situation which is expected when the luminosity approaches the eddington limit .",
    "the typical values of the charge @xmath3 associated with the electric field are not large enough to influence the space ",
    "time around the compact object ( michel 1972 ) , but its presence may nevertheless have interesting astrophysical consequences .",
    "shvartsman ( 1970 ) proposed that such a system could act as an electrostatic accelerator for positrons , for which the electrostatic and radiative forces have the same direction . balancing energy gains and losses ,",
    "due mainly to inverse compton with soft ambient photons , he estimated that positrons may be accelerated to energies of a few tens of mev .",
    "although the `` shvartsman accelerator '' is definitely ingenious , it received little attention in the past , possibly because no obvious positron source seemed available near neutron stars .",
    "however , positrons may be generated by the radioactive decay of the neutron star crust elements subject to the bombardment of accreting particles ( reina , tarenghi , & treves 1974 ; bildsten , shapiro , & wasserman 1992 ) .",
    "pair production may be also expected in accretion models with shocks ( see e.g. shapiro , & salpeter 1975 ) or in hydrostatic atmospheres kept at mildly relativistic temperatures by comptonization ( turolla , _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; zane , turolla , & treves 1996 ) .    here",
    "we reconsider shvartsman s idea , examining the role of cooling processes different from inverse compton ( bremsstrahlung , non  radiative scattering ) and the possibility that accelerated positrons survive annihilation with atmospheric electrons , escaping to infinity .",
    "let us consider spherical accretion onto a neutron star ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 cm ) and for simplicity suppose that the accreting material is ionized hydrogen . neglecting general relativistic corrections ,",
    "the emerging luminosity is related to the accretion rate by @xmath6    when @xmath7 approaches the eddington limit @xmath8 , the flow dynamics is strongly affected by the radiative force ( see e.g maraschi , reina , & treves 1974 , 1978 ; miller 1990 ; park & miller 1991 ; zampieri , turolla , & treves 1993 , hereafter ztt )",
    ". owing to the reduced effective gravity , the flow deviates from free  fall and , for @xmath9 , a settling behaviour appears close to the star surface , where the velocity decreases with radius .",
    "even a small deviation from free ",
    "fall , which is always present for a non  vanishing luminosity , implies that electrons and protons are subject to different accelerations so that an electrostatic field @xmath2 is built up around the star ( shvartsman 1970 ; zeldovich , & novikov 1971 ; michel 1972 ) .",
    "although , in principle , the same argument applies to spherical accretion onto a black hole , the efficiency is so low ( @xmath10 in absence of magnetic fields , see e.g. nobili , turolla , & zampieri 1991 ) that departures from free  fall are really negligible for any reasonable value of the accretion rate .",
    "the expression for @xmath2 can be easily derived considering the forces acting on the two species ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the luminosity in the frame comoving with the accretion flow . equating the two accelerations we get @xmath15 at large radii , where @xmath16 , the previous expression coincides with the result obtained by maraschi , reina , & treves ( 1974 , 1978 ) analyzing the flow equations for the two species @xmath17 an estimate of the largest potential difference",
    "can be easily obtained integrating equation ( 4 ) assuming @xmath18 @xmath19 which shows that , in principle , extremely relativistic positrons may be expected to reach infinity .",
    "here we consider a scenario in which the number density of @xmath20 is not zero at some radius @xmath21 .",
    "positrons are immediately accelerated by the electric field and gain energy at a rate @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the particle velocity . at the same time , positrons are accelerated by the radiative force and suffer radiative losses through inverse compton ( ic ) scatterings with the radiation bath ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 bremsstrahlung ; non  radiative scatterings with the flow electrons . in this section",
    "we concentrate on ic losses , which is the only cooling process taken into account by shvartsman , and we show that , even in this simple case , ultra ",
    "relativistic energies are not expected to be reached . in the next section",
    "we will verify that bremsstrahlung losses are negligible , but that elastic scatterings may be very efficient in transfering energy to ambient electrons and will ultimately stop the positron flow .",
    "the energy lost by a positron for ic scattering with a radiation field of energy density @xmath26 and radiation pressure @xmath27 is @xmath28 while the gain due to the radiative force is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total flux divided by @xmath31 ( gurevich , & rumyantsev 1965 , all the radiation moments are here evaluated in the lab  frame ) . for an isotropic radiation field ,",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 and the expression for the net power reduces to @xmath34 ( see e.g. rybicki , & lightman 1979 ) . accordingly , the positron energy changes with radius as @xmath35    introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the schwarzschild radius , equation ( 10 ) can be written as @xmath41\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    whenever @xmath42 the solution of equation ( 11 ) relaxes immediately to the reduced solution @xmath43\\ ] ] irrespective of the initial particle energy . if no other processes prevent positrons from escaping ( see the discussion in section 4 ) , the terminal lorentz factor can be obtained integrating numerically equation ( 11 ) once the radiation field in the accreting medium is known . in section 5 numerical results based on the accretion model described in ztt will be presented .",
    "equation ( 12 ) also allows a close comparison between our result and shvartsman s one .",
    "the contribution of electrostatic acceleration can be easily obtained dropping @xmath44 in equation ( 10 ) which is , formally , equivalent to put @xmath45 in equation ( 12 ) .",
    "an upper limit for the terminal lorentz factor in this case is given by @xmath46 , which corresponds to a kinetic energy @xmath47 kev .",
    "this is much less than the value of tens of mev proposed by shvartsman .",
    "the point in shvartsman s original analysis that should be reconsidered is the calculation of the ic losses , which were estimated in a very crude way by multiplying the energy exchange in each collision times an `` optical depth '' parameter , @xmath48 . even assuming that the total number of collisions suffered by the positron in traveling a radial distance @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is indeed related to shvartsman s equation ( 2 ) ( and this is questionable )",
    ", @xmath50 should be @xmath51 , since @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that shvartsman s compton cooling is underestimated by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "moreover the final particle energy is evaluated assuming that no losses are present for @xmath54 which results in a even larger underestimate of ic cooling .",
    "in the previous section we have derived the energy equation for positrons , including only ic cooling . in section 5",
    "we show that , even under this favourable assumption , the positrons terminal lorentz factor is @xmath55 ( see table 1 ) . in order to establish",
    "if indeed these mildly relativistic particles may reach infinity , we need a more thorough understanding of the physical conditions in the flow close to the star surface . in our scenario four different kinds of particles are present : `` primary '' electrons and protons of the accreting material , with the same number density @xmath56 and temperature @xmath57 , together with positrons and electrons , with number density @xmath58 and temperature @xmath59 , that are created in the atmosphere by photon  photon or particle collisions .",
    "we will limit our discussion to the case in which @xmath60 , so the number density of electrons is @xmath61 .",
    "the first issue that should be addressed concerns the probability that positrons annihilate with ambient electrons .",
    "this question arises quite naturally since , at variance with shvartsman s scenario in which highly relativistic energies are expected , now the particle energy is not high enough to ensure that the cross section for pair annihilation becomes negligible .    in the non  relativistic limit ,",
    "the annihilation rate for positrons and electrons with arbitrary distribution functions is ( svensson 1982 ) @xmath62 we introduce a characteristic time @xmath63 for annihilation defined as @xmath64 since @xmath63 depends on @xmath56 , it gives the probability of annihilation on a scale of order the density lengthscale in the accretion flow , @xmath65 . on the other hand , a positron of energy @xmath66 covers a distance @xmath67 in a time @xmath68 @xmath69 and the particle survives annihilation if @xmath70 . a numerical comparison between these two timescales",
    "will be given in the next section for different values of both the emergent luminosity and @xmath21 .",
    "here we only note that , in the more favourable situations in which particles are immediately accelerated up to @xmath71 , this condition is met if @xmath72 this limit is fairly easy to satisfy for near eddington accretion since @xmath73@xmath74@xmath75 close to the star surface .",
    "other cooling mechanisms that could influence the maximum positron energy are radiative and non  radiative scattering with ions and electrons in the accretion flow .",
    "the positron ",
    "ion bremsstrahlung energy loss is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the charge of the ions .",
    "this process acts on a characteristic timescale @xmath78 which , compared with @xmath63 , yields @xmath79 so , for pure hydrogen , bremsstrahlung losses are negligible for particles surviving annihilation and free  free could represent a competitive cooling process only for large @xmath77 .    on the other hand , the energy exchange due to collisions is indeed important and can modify substantially the picture outlined up to now .",
    "let us introduce the energy loss rate @xmath80 for a test particle in a plasma of protons and electrons as @xmath81 and focus on the non  relativistic regime .",
    "the more efficient process is radiationless , elastic scattering between positrons and electrons ; positron  proton equipartition needs a larger timescale by a factor @xmath82 .",
    "the energy loss rate can be obtained from the expression of diffusion coefficients , which , in the limit @xmath23 much larger than the proton velocity , yields ( see e.g. rosenbluth , & sagdeev 1983 ) @xmath83 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath85 the electron velocity .",
    "the rate @xmath80 is not necessarily positive since a fast particle tends to lose energy to the plasma and a slow one to gain energy .",
    "initial differences in the mean velocities of positrons and electrons are eliminated by collisions in a time @xmath86 .",
    "the importance of collisions can be quantified comparing @xmath87 with the dynamical timescale given by expression ( 15 ) .",
    "in order to investigate the effects of electrostatic plus radiative acceleration on particles injected in different atmospheric layers , we have solved equation ( 11 ) varying both the accretion luminosity and the injection radius @xmath21 .",
    "the run of the flow variables has been taken from the one  fluid models computed by ztt for near  eddington accretion of a `` cold '' , pure scattering medium onto neutron stars .",
    "the solutions are plotted , together with the reduced solution ( equation 12 ) , in figures 1a , b , c for @xmath880.3 , 0.6 and 0.9 , respectively . for",
    "any given luminosity , we have considered three different values of @xmath21 , which correspond to a scattering optical depth @xmath89 ( see table 1 ) , with the exception of the case @xmath90 , for which the maximum optical depth is @xmath91 at the star surface .",
    "this simple choice allows us to mimic the acceleration of positrons initially created in different atmospheric layers , and , increasing the luminosity , to visualize the process in the presence of more and more expanded atmospheres . in order to account for the anisotropy of the radiation field",
    ", we introduced the closure @xmath92 , adopting for @xmath93 the same expression used by ztt , @xmath94 + 1 /3 $ ] .",
    "the final energies in all the cases we considered are listed in table 1 .",
    "figures 2a , b , c show the comparison between @xmath68 and @xmath95 for the same choice of the parameters .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , the reduced solution is always attained at small radii , but at the same time annihilation acts efficiently in the inner dense atmospheric layers preventing positrons created in optically thick regions from escaping .",
    "the chance to surviving annihilation increases for particles created in photospheric regions and above , although positrons starting at @xmath96 reach infinity with a lower lorentz factor .",
    "the larger terminal velocities are expected for low values of @xmath7 when the photosphere is closer to the star surface .",
    "figures 3a , b , c show @xmath97 together with @xmath87 for two different values of the gas temperature , since the efficiency of coulomb collisions strongly depends on the difference between the test particle and the electron velocities .",
    "we note that only for @xmath98 kev is @xmath99 negative in an extended region near @xmath21 , so the possibility that positrons gain additional energy owing to collisions appears remote . on the other hand , under the more realistic assumption that @xmath100 kev , as expected in typical x  ray sources , we find that mildly relativistic positrons are `` de facto '' prevented from reaching infinity , all differences between the mean energies of the two species being washed out by the collective effect of soft collisions .",
    "in this paper we have reconsidered acceleration of positrons near a neutron star accreting close to the eddington limit . the radiative force and the electrostatic thrust due to the non  vanishing electric field around the neutron star",
    "are opposed by inverse compton losses and elastic scattering with electrons of the accreting material .",
    "ultimately , these are the main agents responsible for both the acceleration and deceleration of positrons .",
    "the maximum energy which can be achieved by positrons owing to the electrostatic acceleration alone is limited to @xmath47 kev which differs substantially from shvartsman s estimate of few tens of mev .",
    "the main contribution to the particle s acceleration is therefore provided by the radiative force , which acts equally on electrons and positrons .",
    "we have also shown that the largest terminal lorentz factors are still @xmath55 , even if this additional gain is accounted for .",
    "a first consequence is that the maximum energies attained by positrons are in a range where pair annihilation is still important , at least for particles created at @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , elastic scatterings with cold electrons in the accretion flow oppose the particle acceleration and provide an additional source of trapping .",
    "this suggests that only a fraction of positrons will actually leave the star , while the rest should annihilate and eventually contribute to a narrow 511 kev line .",
    "furthermore , no multiplication through electromagnetic showers either on the accreting material or on the photons can be expected , so the positron production depends mainly on the injection process .",
    "moreover , we note that the same conclusions discussed above can be applied to particles injected below @xmath102 ( i.e. below @xmath103 ) , quite independently of the initial conditions . if the source is close to the eddington limit , even if positrons are injected with energies @xmath104 mev , like in radioactive decay , because of the efficiency of ic losses , their final energy will be limited to @xmath105 kev and the possibility of outstream or annihilation will not change .",
