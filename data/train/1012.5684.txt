    "completion of the knowledge of the generalized nuclear force , which includes not only the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction but also hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) and hyperon - hyperon ( yy ) interactions , brought the deeper understanding of atomic nuclei , structure of neutron stars and supernova explosions .",
    "however it is hard to know the properties of the yn and yy interactions because their scattering data in free - space are scarce .    recently",
    "a method to extract the @xmath8 potential through the nbs wave function from lattice qcd simulations has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the obtained potential is found to have desirable features , such as attractive well at long and medium distances , and the central repulsive core at short distance  @xcite .",
    "further applications have been done in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 , @xmath1 b - b system to seek the @xmath9 interaction and to see the su(3)@xmath10 breaking effects of b - b interaction from lattice qcd simulation .",
    "the @xmath11 baryon - baryon state consists of the @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 components in terms of low - lying baryons .",
    "mass differences of these components are quite small , and it causes the contamination of nbs wave function from excited states .",
    "in sucn situation the source operator should be optimized to extract the energy eigen states through the variational method  @xcite .",
    "the equal - time nbs wave function @xmath14 for an energy eigen state with @xmath15 is extracted from the four point function , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is diagonalized wall - source operator .",
    "the transition potential matrix of 3-states coupled channel equation can be acquired in a particle basis or a su(3 ) irreducible representation ( ir ) basis .",
    "they are connected by unitary trandformation ( see in appendix b in ref .",
    "the non - diagonal part of potential matrix in ir basis is a good measure of the su(3 ) breaking effect .",
    ".hadron masses in unit of [ mev ] are listed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this calculation we employ the 2 + 1-flavor full qcd gauge configurations of japan lattice data grid(jldg)/international lattice data grid(ildg ) .",
    "they are generated by the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations with a renormalization - group improved gauge action and a non - perturbatively @xmath18 improved clover quark action at @xmath19 , corresponding to lattice spacings of @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "we choose three ensembles of the @xmath21 lattice which means the spatial volume of about @xmath22 .",
    "quark propagators are calculated from the spatial wall source at @xmath23 with the dirichlet boundary condition in temporal direction at @xmath24 .",
    "the numerical computation is carried out at kek supercomputer system , blue gene / l .",
    "the hadron masses are shown in table  [ tab : gconf ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : potall ] we compare the results of potential matrix in the ir basis calculated in different configuration sets .",
    "we found the growth of repulstive core in the @xmath25 potential with decreasing the light quark mass .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 transition potential are consistent with zero within error bar . on the other hand ,",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath28 transition potential which is not allowed in the su(3 ) symmetric world is strengthen as the su(3)@xmath10 breaking gets larger .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath29 bb state , which is known as the @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 coupled state , from lattice qcd .",
    "we have found a small transition potential between the singlet and octet state in terms of the su(3 ) ir basis .",
    "such transition can not be allowed in the su(3 ) symmetric world .",
    "this method could greatly assist us to complete the knowledge of not only the generalized nuclear force but also the interaction of hadrons including mesons , baryons and quarks .",
