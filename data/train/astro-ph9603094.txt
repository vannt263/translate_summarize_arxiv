    "before presenting the method of the mode calculation in more detail , we first introduce the unperturbed galaxy models for which the calculations were performed .",
    "all our models have the same unperturbed potential and mass density , but feature different distribution functions , with varying velocity dispersion , streaming velocity and anisotropy .",
    "the potential of the unperturbed galaxy was constructed as a sum of two kuzmin - toomre disk potentials with different core radii . in the plane of the disk ,",
    "it is given by @xmath0 note that potentials are defined as binding energies , with a positive sign .",
    "this potential produces a rotation curve which is much flatter than a single component kuzmin - toomre potential ( see fig .",
    "[ figrot ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the flat part to the rising part is about @xmath1 .",
    "although the rotation curve tends to rise somewhat too slowly near the centre , it has , at least qualitatively , a realistic behaviour .",
    "it is well - known that strongly flattened galaxies usually have a substantial amount of dark halo mass , extending much further than the visible component .",
    "it is sufficient for our purpose to model it by a spherical and pressure - supported galaxy component .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that this halo component only influences the stability behaviour of the disk by its contribution to the global potential .",
    "the same roughly holds for the central bulge , which is hot and has a three - dimensional structure as well .",
    "thus both the halo and the bulge are `` inert '' and the corresponding potential and mass density are taken to be spherical and denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the disk itself is the only component which is supposed to consist of `` active mass '' , sensitive to instabilities .",
    "the unperturbed disk is supposed to be two - dimensional and axisymmetric , with a surface density @xmath4 and a potential @xmath5 .",
    "we chose an exponential mass profile with a central core : @xmath6 although this mass density extends up to infinity , the actual models have an outer limit at @xmath7 , and the mass density reaches zero at that point .",
    "this we achieve by fitting the distributions ( [ dens0 ] ) with several finite components .",
    "the relative error made at the outer edge is only of the order of 0.1% .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 determines the total disk mass .    since the total system",
    "should be self - consistent , the total potential in the plane of the galaxy is given by the sum of the disk and halo component : @xmath9 since the total potential @xmath10 has a fixed form ( [ pot0 ] ) and the potential of the disk is determined by the surface mass density ( [ dens0 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath11 .",
    "thus follows the halo mass density @xmath12 and the total halo mass within a radius @xmath13 @xmath14    of course , the halo mass density should everywhere be positive .",
    "this puts an upper limit on the value of @xmath8 in ( [ dens0 ] ) .",
    "the relative contribution of the disk and halo components are quantified using the halo - to - disk factor , @xmath15 , which gives the proportion of the total mass inside the radius @xmath16 ( = 6 ) for the halo and the active disk .",
    "self - consistency with a non - negative spherical halo puts a lower limit on @xmath15 of about @xmath17 .",
    "note that the assumption of a spherical halo is not a crucial one .",
    "if one would assume an oblate halo , the only effect would be a somewhat lower minimum @xmath15 .",
    "we will examine the stability behaviour for different stellar distributions . according to jeans theorem ,",
    "the unperturbed part of the distribution is a function of two integrals of motion , the binding energy @xmath18 and the angular momentum @xmath19 , defined by @xmath20 in order to generate a variety of finite disks , based on the potential ( [ pot0 ] ) , the distribution function is written as a linear combination of basic distributions : @xmath21 all components only have a ( everywhere positive ) contribution for orbits lying completely inside @xmath16 , i.e. for the region where ( see also fig [ lind1 ] ) @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath16 the radius of the edge of the disk . equation ( [ excl2 ] ) is required in order to exclude the region @xmath24 . in addition , the distribution goes to zero at this edge in a smooth way , so that the first derivative remains finite everywhere .",
    "the explicit form of the components is listed in the appendix .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath25 are determined by a least square fit of the corresponding mass density to the proposed exponential form ( [ dens0 ] ) ( the coefficients are forced to be positive , in order to avoid negative distributions ) . by choosing an appropriate set of components @xmath26 , we were able to create the desired orbital densities .",
    "in all the models , the error on the fit to the mass density never exceeds 1% of the central value .",
    "we constructed 4 models , labeled i to iv ( the explicit form of the distribution functions is listed in the appendix ) . along the sequence ,",
    "the models become more and more rotation - supported , having an increasing streaming velocity and decreasing temperature . fig .",
    "[ figveloci ] shows the streaming velocities and dispersions for the coldest and hottest case .",
    "the dispersions all go to zero at the edge of the disk .",
    "note that model i is perfectly isotropic and has a linearly increasing mean velocity curve .",
    "for all disks , toomre s local axisymmetric instability criterion ( @xcite ) @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 the radial velocity dispersion and @xmath29 the epicyclic frequency ) is everywhere higher than @xmath30 .    in fig .",
    "[ figdf0 ] , the distribution function of model iii is shown in turning point space .",
    "the turning points of an orbit are the largest ( resp .",
    "smallest ) distance from the centre that an orbit can reach , and are called apocentre @xmath31 , or pericentre @xmath32 . by convention",
    ", we take @xmath31 always positive , while @xmath32 has the same sign as @xmath19 .",
    "evidently , these quantities are integrals of the motion and @xmath33 ( on circular orbits , @xmath34 ) . for a given pair @xmath35 , the energy and angular momentum follow immediately from @xmath36 which leads to @xmath37 and @xmath38 inversely , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are found as the roots for @xmath13 of ( [ eext ] ) for a particular @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we preferred these variables over the normal @xmath39 space , not only because they have an easy physical interpretation , but also because this representation is more related to our method for solving the linearized boltzmann equation , which employs a grid interpolation in the turning point space ( see following section ) .",
    "we have chosen finite disks in order to compactify phase space . however , as can be seen from the distribution function ( fig .",
    "[ figdf0 ] ) , the disk reaches this limit at @xmath16 in a very smooth way .",
    "this is important since it has been proven that a sharp edge or , more generally , a sharp feature in @xmath39 space , can introduce additional instabilities which might not always be physical ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since we want to study uniformly rotating perturbation modes , we suppose the following form for the perturbing potential : @xmath40 in this expression ( and in all later similar expressions ) , only the real part corresponds to the physical quantity . there is no problem",
    "though to calculate with these complex expressions , since all equations are linear .",
    "this perturbation is rotating with a pattern speed of @xmath41 and is exponentially growing with a growth factor @xmath42 .",
    "a more general pattern can be obtained as a superposition of such components with different @xmath43 .",
    "we will search for the linear modes using a matrix method , which requires a set of potential - density pairs suitable for the expansion of the perturbation .",
    "the literature offers a variety of analytical sets for infinite disks ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) as well as for finite ones ( eg .",
    "the choice of a particular set largely depends on the structure of the unperturbed potential @xmath10 and density @xmath44 .",
    "the importance of a suitable set of potential - densities is clearly illustrated by the displacement mode of a self - consistent disk .",
    "if the model has no inert halo component , a simple translation of the system is a valid `` perturbation '' . in linear theory",
    ", this corresponds to an @xmath45 mode of the form ( see also section [ verplaatstest ] ) @xmath46 the potential - density pairs should of course be able to fit this behaviour well ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is very important to choose the set as efficiently as possible , so that not too many expansion terms need to be calculated . for these reasons , we decided not to rely on existing analytical sets , but to create numerical sets which are tailor - made for the present unperturbed disk .",
    "if the maximum radius of the finite disk is denoted by @xmath16 , the set of densities for @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 and for @xmath49 by @xmath50 these densities have the right behaviour in the centre and at the edge of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , their number of radial nodes is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding potentials @xmath52 are easily calculated numerically using the integral form of the poisson equation .",
    "these potential - density pairs prove to be very efficient for the expansion of the normal modes .",
    "of course , these modes in principle could have been expanded using analytical complete sets described in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , but this would require a long summation up to very high order , particularly because the density falls to zero very smoothly at the edge .",
    "the total disk is modeled using two parts , a time - independent axisymmetric unperturbed part , and a small perturbation .",
    "hence , the distribution function is written as @xmath53 while the total potential , which is defined as a binding energy ( being positive everywhere ) , reads @xmath54 if the system is exposed to the perturbing potential @xmath55 , the corresponding linearized response distribution is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfy ( using poisson brackets ) @xmath59= [ e , v']\\ ] ] and @xmath60= [ j , v'].\\ ] ] integration with respect to the time along unperturbed orbits of both equations and expansion of the poisson brackets immediately yields ( since the left hand side is the total time derivative along an unperturbed orbit ) @xmath61 the integrand is to be evaluated along the unperturbed orbit which passes at @xmath62 through the point @xmath63 .",
    "one should note that these expressions can only hold if the perturbation was zero at @xmath64 and is , at least infinitesimally , growing .    with a potential of the form",
    "@xmath65 we have @xmath66 these integrals are to be evaluated along unperturbed orbits , so one needs a way to handle such orbits .",
    "since the unperturbed potential @xmath10 is axisymmetric , the corresponding orbital structure is particularly simple .",
    "taking advantage of the conservation of angular momentum @xmath19 , one can conclude that the radial coordinate behaves like the coordinate of a particle in a one - dimensional ( so - called effective ) potential @xmath67 supposed that the orbit is bound ( which is the only case of interest for galaxies ) , the radial coordinate along an unperturbed orbit should be a periodic function of time , with angular frequency @xmath68 . from this",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are periodic with frequency @xmath68 as well . as the mean value of @xmath70 should not necessarily be zero , the angular coordinate @xmath71 will be a superposition of a periodic function and a uniform `` drift '' velocity : @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 a periodic function with period @xmath68 ) .",
    "we will now rewrite the integrands of ( [ dfe1 ] ) and ( [ dfj1 ] ) by factorizing the part which is periodical with angular frequency @xmath68 : @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are periodic , they can be expanded in fourier series : @xmath79 when these forms are substituted in ( [ dfe2 ] ) and ( [ dfj2 ] ) , the integrations can be carried out analytically , at least if the perturbation is growing , @xmath80 .",
    "note that , when the perturbation is decaying in time ( @xmath81 ) , one can still obtain a solution by performing the integrations ( [ dfe2 ] ) and ( [ dfj2 ] ) from @xmath62 to @xmath82 .",
    "the fourier expansion strategy yields the response distribution for any given perturbing potential , but a number of steps are involved even for calculating one single point of the distribution : the orbit should be integrated for at least one half of the radial period , and the appropriate functions are to be expanded in fourier series . since the perturbed distribution will be evaluated many times ( e.g. for the calculation of the perturbed mass density one has to integrate over the velocities ) , it is absolutely necessary to be able to evaluate the response as fast as possible .",
    "our solution is to calculate all appropriate parameters ( the frequencies @xmath68 and @xmath83 and the fourier expansions @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) on a ( two - dimensional ) grid in integral space and to store the result on disk for future use .",
    "we found that is was not so convenient to use @xmath86 as grid coordinates , since this grid is very inhomogeneous and has a relatively low density near the circular orbits , where disk galaxies have a dense population .",
    "moreover , the circular orbit limit on this grid is usually not given in an analytic form .",
    "for these reasons , we used @xmath31 and @xmath87 as grid coordinates . in this representation , we can apply a simple rectangular grid which is very dense close to circular orbits and in the neighbourhood of the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath88 space is , up to the maximum radius @xmath89 , discretized using a rectangular grid . on each point of this grid ,",
    "the fourier expansion for the orbit starting at @xmath62 in its apocentre ( by choice ) is calculated and stored in a library , together with a tabulation of @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] . in the following paragraphs , we will frequently use both the time and @xmath13dependence of the same variable . in order to avoid confusing notations",
    ", @xmath13dependences will be written using square brackets .",
    "the time and coordinate system is chosen in such a way that @xmath71 and @xmath92 are zero at the apocentre .    when the response distribution is later required in a point @xmath93 in phase space , the corresponding turning points @xmath94 and @xmath95 are calculated and all parameters are interpolated using the four closest points on the grid ( note that , since the response is a known periodic function of @xmath71 , it is sufficient to evaluate it at @xmath96 ) . in this way , we get an orbit out of the library with the correct integrals of motion , but passing through its apocentre at @xmath62 .",
    "we will denote this library orbit and all corresponding quantities with a superindex @xmath97 .",
    "as the point @xmath98 is in general not the apocentre of the orbit , one should take in account an offset in time for the actual orbit passing through @xmath98 : @xmath99 ) , \\ ] ] note that @xmath100 $ ] is actually a double  valued relation .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath101 can be used to determine which branch of the relation should be used . in general , there is also an offset in azimuth : @xmath102 )       -\\theta_p^l[r^0],\\ ] ] which is of course the reason why the functions @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] are stored .",
    "note that the presence of these functions does not reduce the speed of the calculations , but implies only a slight increase in used disk space .",
    "the resulting perturbed distribution in that point follows then immediately : @xmath103 - m \\theta_p^l[r^0 ] ) }                      \\over                 i ( l \\omega_r^l + m \\omega_\\theta^l - \\omega ) } \\ ] ] and @xmath104 - m \\theta_p^l[r^0 ] ) }                      \\over                 i",
    "( l \\omega_r^l + m \\omega_\\theta^l - \\omega ) } .\\ ] ]    the fourier coefficients which are stored on the grid only depend on the unperturbed and the perturbing potential . furthermore , since the latter will be expanded in a basis , this has to be done only for the discrete set @xmath105 .",
    "the orbits are obtained by integrating the system over half a period using a fourth order runge - kutta .",
    "special attention should be paid to @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 ) orbits , which have to be integrated in rectangular coordinates .",
    "in addition , since the fourier coefficients are discontinuous at @xmath106 ( see also @xcite ) , this should be performed twice , for `` infinitesimally small '' opposite values of @xmath19 in order to get the correct left and right limit .",
    "the fourier expansion is performed up to the order @xmath108 .",
    "this number should be relatively large in order to provide an accurate fit to the high excentricity orbits , which show fast variations close to the centre .",
    "a grid resolution of @xmath109 proved to provide more than enough accuracy , particularly because the functions do not show very steep gradients in the turning point space . in these circumstances and for a set of 8 perturbing potentials , the calculations take less than 4 hours on a 100 specfp92 workstation .",
    "this work only has to be redone when one changes the unperturbed potential .",
    "[ figfour ] shows some of the fourier coefficient grids for a @xmath110 perturbing potential .",
    "it clearly illustrates that the higher order fourier terms are only important for small @xmath87 and for large @xmath31 , which means for very eccentric orbits .",
    "this indicates that , for relatively cool galaxies , a small number of fourier terms can already yield reliable results .",
    "[ figpdf ] displays some response distribution functions for different @xmath111 .",
    "the left and middle panels have the same pattern speed @xmath41 and are taken somewhat inside the corotation radius .",
    "the left panel shows a response with a much smaller growth rate and therefore has a more prominent corotation resonance , appearing as a ring - shaped feature .",
    "this picture still has to be multiplied with @xmath112 which , for relatively cool disks , will emphasize the stars in the neighbourhood of circular orbits .",
    "one of the most crucial effects of non - zero velocity dispersion is that the distribution function populates stars on all possible orbits that are resonant with the perturbations , not only the resonances on circular orbits .",
    "these orbits fill a complicated region in phase space , cuts of which can be seen in velocity space in fig .",
    "[ figpdf ] . due to the differential rotation , a substantial number of orbits at this radius are in corotation resonance , although this is not the corotation radius .",
    "[ figreso ] shows , for a fixed radius , the velocity dependence of the resonant @xmath111 value for the dominant @xmath110 resonances .",
    "this value is given by @xmath113 the lowest order resonances for stars rotating in the direct sense ( @xmath114 ) are @xmath115= @xmath116 ( ilr ) , @xmath117 ( cr ) and @xmath30 ( olr ) .",
    "however , there is a problem in this definition for counterrotating stars , since @xmath83 discontinuously changes its sign at @xmath118 .",
    "this can be resolved by noticing that if , for counterrotating stars , @xmath115 is replaced by @xmath119 in ( [ defreso ] ) , the resulting @xmath111 has an overall smooth behaviour .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for zero momentum stars @xmath120 .",
    "the ring - shaped cr position , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figreso ] ( for varying @xmath111 ) , can easily be found back in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figpdf ] ( for a specific value of @xmath111 ) .    since @xmath68 and @xmath83 depend mostly on the energy @xmath18 , the cr , olr and higher resonances are roughly concentric circles around the origin . at the ilr",
    "though , the sum largely cancels out and result is mostly dominated by the angular momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the method of the previous section can be used to calculate the perturbed distribution in a particular point of phase space @xmath121 . writing the velocities",
    "@xmath122 in polar coordinates @xmath123 , this results in a response @xmath124 with @xmath125 in order to obtain the perturbed mass density at a radius @xmath13 and for @xmath96 , one has to integrate this expression over the velocities up to the escape velocity .",
    "since the position of the pole @xmath126 in general depends also on the velocities , the denominator should be kept inside this integration : @xmath127    in each term of the sum , we will switch the integration variables from @xmath123 to @xmath128 .",
    "the velocity then becomes a function @xmath129 and the integral is written as @xmath130 the limits of the first integral can be chosen freely , as long as the interval is large enough to cover all poles .",
    "if @xmath131 is not a monotone function of @xmath132 over the entire region of interest , this transformation can still be performed by splitting up the integral in parts .",
    "there is a simple reason to write the expression in this way : for a constant @xmath13 , the inner integrals are functions which only depend on @xmath126 .",
    "if we sum all these functions over @xmath115 and denote this summation with @xmath133 , the perturbed mass density reduces to @xmath134 which is a simple weighted integral over all real pole positions .",
    "this integral represents the hilbert transform of @xmath135 with respect to @xmath136 , assuming that @xmath137 is also a function of @xmath111 . for each value of @xmath13",
    ", the function @xmath133 can be tabulated and stored for later use .",
    "the evaluation of the perturbed density for any value of @xmath111 is then reduced to the numerical evaluation of a one - dimensional integral , which can be performed very fast .    in practice , @xmath133 is not calculated using the explicit integral ( [ vsi ] ) , because this would require the ( piecewise ) inversion of @xmath138 , which can be awkward . instead",
    ", an alternative method is used , based on the two - dimensional integral ( [ rhoaa ] ) . for any value of @xmath13",
    ", @xmath139 is maintained in a tabular form , containing function values at fixed points with interleave @xmath140 .",

    "the integrand of ( [ rhoaa ] ) is approximately constant with respect to @xmath132 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of this cell to the integral is a pole function with respect to @xmath111 , having a pole position @xmath144 and an amplitude @xmath145 .",
    "this amplitude is now added to the table value of @xmath139 that has a @xmath136 value lying closest to @xmath146 .",
    "when all cells are summed , dividing all values in the @xmath139 table by @xmath140 yields a numerical tabulation of @xmath139 . in practice ,",
    "the summation over the cells is refined using a trapezoidal rule .",
    "the values of the function @xmath133 are stored on a grid containing 40 points in the @xmath13 dimension and @xmath147 points in the @xmath136 dimension , and the integral ( [ intrho ] ) is calculated by linear interpolation between the points in the @xmath136 dimension .",
    "however , one should be careful with values of @xmath111 lying in the neighbourhood of the real axis . if @xmath42 is zero , the result is meaningless when @xmath148 in a region @xmath149 $ ] ( in this case , stars are in resonance with a steady perturbation and the linear approximation breaks down anyhow ) .",
    "in addition , for such a region of non - zero weight for poles , @xmath150 should be large in comparison with the grid distance of the @xmath136 grid in order to have a reliable interpolation .",
    "this is the reason why we take such a dense grid for @xmath136 .    in fig .",
    "[ figpoles ] , the pole distribution @xmath133 at various radii for a typical configuration is shown . for small @xmath13 ,",
    "the contributions of each resonance are easily distinguished , while for large @xmath13 the behaviour becomes more complex since the stars move slowly and many higher order resonances occur .",
    "this picture also clearly illustrates the non - localized character of the resonances , particularly for the corotation ( cr ) and outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) .",
    "the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) is , even for hot disks , much sharper , and remains roughly at the same value for @xmath111 throughout the galaxy .",
    "as noticed earlier ( @xcite ) , this interesting behaviour follows from the structure of the unperturbed potential . due to this behaviour",
    ", the ilr plays a crucial role in the stability behaviour , even for high velocity dispersions .",
    "note that , for the panel corresponding with @xmath151 , one can easily correlate the regions in @xmath136 spanned by the contributions of the individual resonances with the variation in @xmath111 shown by the corresponding contour plot in fig .",
    "[ figreso ] .",
    "a matrix method is applied for searching the normal modes ( @xcite ) .",
    "a general perturbing potential is written as @xmath152 of course @xmath153 should be large enough so that all desired modes can be expanded accurately ( the limitation on @xmath153 puts a limitation on the oscillatory behaviour of the modes ) .    using the methods described in the previous paragraphs , the pole density functions @xmath154 associated with the perturbing potentials",
    "@xmath155 are calculated and expanded as @xmath156 this expansion is obtained using a least square fit .",
    "one can easily obtain @xmath157 in tabular form by performing the fit on each of the rows in the @xmath13 direction of the @xmath133 grid .",
    "we can now write the response density @xmath158 for each of the potentials @xmath155 as @xmath159 if we define @xmath160    the response potential of ( [ pertpot ] ) now follows immediately : @xmath161 for a self - consistent mode , this response should be equal to the original perturbing potential ( [ pertpot ] ) .",
    "so the search for normal modes is reduced to the search for those values of @xmath111 for which the matrix @xmath162 ( with elements @xmath163 ) has a unity eigenvalue @xmath164 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector gives the expansion of the normal mode .",
    "a typical situation for the multi - valued eigenvalue relation @xmath165 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figeigval ] .",
    "the steep edge in @xmath166 and the sharp peak in @xmath167 at small positive pattern speeds are the dominating features and are caused by the ilr because the reaction of the disk is strongest at ilr ( see also fig . [ figpoles ] ) .",
    "for each value of @xmath42 and for each branch , there appears to be only one ( small and positive ) value of @xmath168 where @xmath167 is zero .",
    "the value of @xmath166 , which decreases for increasing @xmath42 , further determines the mode location .",
    "obviously this search for unity eigenvalues in the complex plane has to be performed numerically .",
    "this is the main reason why we put so much emphasis on the development of a method to evaluate @xmath162 as fast as possible .",
    "it takes less than a second to calculate the eigenvalues for a particular @xmath111 , using an expansion up to an order @xmath169 . due to the efficient structure of the potential ",
    "density pairs , this limit is certainly sufficient for an accurate expansion of the unstable modes , since they prove to be of a relatively low order . the program calculates a detailed numerical tabulation of the complete dispersion relation in a sufficiently large region of the complex plane . this tabulation is further used to determine all modes using a binary intersection algorithm .",
    "this whole procedure takes less than one hour .",
    "of course , there is a strong need for good checkpoints before starting to interpret the results coming out of this method .",
    "we checked the system in three ways , together covering more or less the whole chain of operations .",
    "the positive results of these checks are not only a good indication that the calculations are not obviously wrong , but they provide a good tool to determine the values of the various parameters ( grid resolutions , expansion limits , ... ) in order to get results with sufficient accuracy .",
    "most of these parameters were actually determined experimentally , using these test cases .      for a given perturbing potential ,",
    "the linearized boltzmann equation can be integrated numerically , at least for sufficiently fast growing perturbations .",
    "this yields values for the perturbed distribution function which should be the same as those coming from the fourier expansion along the orbits .      in a previous paper ( @xcite )",
    ", the mode analysis for uniformly rotating disks has already been performed in an independent way .",
    "if the same models are treated using the present approach , the same results should come out .      as mentioned already , for models without passive component ,",
    "a simple displacement of the disk is a valid `` perturbation '' ( @xcite ) . in a linear approach ,",
    "the responses corresponding to this mode are obtained by derivation of the unperturbed values with respect to a rectangular coordinate ( e.g. @xmath170 ) . for the unperturbed mass density , this results in ( using the fact that @xmath171 ) @xmath172 the distribution function",
    "gives rise to the following perturbation : @xmath173 so that we immediately have that @xmath174 and @xmath175 we used a self - consistent model based on a single kuzmin - toomre potential to prove that the method is able to find such modes .",
    "note that , although this displacement mode occurs at @xmath176 , there is no problem with the resonances since the pole distribution @xmath177 for @xmath45 perturbations , which we verified numerically .",
    "we performed the linear mode analysis for the models i to iv .",
    "these models have a roughly isotropic distribution function , with a velocity dispersion which is decreasing from model i to model iv .",
    "the aim of this set of models is to address the dependence of the stability on two important parameters , the velocity dispersion and the halo to disk proportion , @xmath15 .",
    "both parameters are now widely believed to have a crucial impact on the stability .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a particular model will be represented by its central value , @xmath178 , which is a good estimator of the relative overall behaviour ( see fig . [ figveloci ] ) .",
    "unstable modes with @xmath43 varying from @xmath117 to @xmath179 were sought in all models and for varying @xmath15 .",
    "one can easily obtain the results for different @xmath15 simply by varying the total magnitude of the unperturbed distribution function , represented by @xmath8 in ( [ dens0 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figunstab ] , the stability limits for these modes are plotted in the @xmath178 vs. @xmath15 plane ( we chose @xmath180 as a stability limit , since @xmath181 is unreachable with our method ) .",
    "these curves were obtained by a cubic spline interpolation between the four models , which are represented by small circles . for most of the modes , only a small fraction of the models can actually reach the unstable regime .",
    "the other models only become unstable if they are combined with a spherical halo which is not everywhere positive ( and hence @xmath182 ) . the curves in figure [ figunstab ] and [ figgrowth ] are always interpolations between all four models , but many models appear under the @xmath183 limit .",
    "the region under each curve is the unstable region . at every point of the figure ,",
    "the actual ( in)stability of the disk is of course determined by the highest limit .",
    "not surprisingly , the disk is effectively stabilized by increasing the velocity dispersion or by adding mass to the inert halo , or a combination of both . this behaviour has already been reported for various other cases , such as kuzmin potentials ( @xcite , @xcite ) and quadratic potentials ( @xcite ) .",
    "another feature , which was also shown to be present in quadratic potentials , is that the slope of the stability limits increases for increasing @xmath43 ( at least for @xmath184 ) . for hot disks ,",
    "the @xmath110 mode is the only unstable one , while at the cool end , @xmath185 turned out to be the most unstable perturbation .",
    "note that the model i was found to be stable for all calculated harmonics .",
    "the growth rate for the most unstable @xmath110 mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ figgrowth ] , again as a function of @xmath178 and @xmath15 .",
    "this picture clearly shows that the growth rate tends to increase in a more than linear way as the halo mass decreases .",
    "there is also a tendency that the contour lines become less dependent on the velocity dispersion for large values of the growth rate .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that varying the velocity dispersion re - distributes the weights @xmath139 of the pole positions , and does not change the overall intensity ( which is influenced by the factor @xmath15 ) .",
    "when @xmath42 becomes large , the pole distribution is `` seen '' from a big distance , and the internal positions become less important than the overall intensity .    athanassoula and sellwood ( 1986 ) suggest that a value of @xmath186-@xmath17 for toomre s local stability parameter @xmath187 might by a useful criterion for stability of the disk against global @xmath110 perturbations . for the present models , fig .",
    "[ figtoomre ] plots the growth rate of the dominant @xmath110 mode against the corresponding @xmath188 , the value in the centre of the galaxy . as @xmath187 is an increasing function of the radius",
    ", @xmath188 is a lower limit of any averaging of @xmath187 over the disk . for each model ,",
    "the variation in @xmath187 is obtained by changing @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( [ defq ] ) shows that @xmath187 simply scales with @xmath44 , which is influenced by @xmath15 .",
    "the figure shows that a value between @xmath186 and @xmath189 is indeed again a good estimation of the stability limit .",
    "our values are slightly larger than those of sellwood & athanassoula , but this can be explained by the fact that they used a softened gravity .    the pattern speed of the perturbation , given by @xmath41 , is plotted against the growth rate in fig .",
    "[ figpattern ] ( note that @xmath181 is , again , an extrapolation ) .",
    "this curve is shown for the three unstable models ii , iii and iv , and the variation in the growth rate is obtained by varying @xmath15 .",
    "the endpoints of these curves are a consequence of the self - consistency requirement .",
    "the pattern speed has a clear increasing correlation with the growth rate , which is again in agreement with n - body simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this figure shows that , for the same growth rate , the pattern speed decreases with the velocity dispersion . on the same picture , the upper limit on the pattern speed for the presence of an ilr is shown as a horizontal line . from this , it is clear that none of our models have an ilr , again in agreement with the results decribed by athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) .",
    "in fact , orbits which are in ilr cause such a violent response ( see e.g. fig . [ figpoles ] and fig . [ figeigval ] ) that it would be very hard for a galaxy to maintain much of them .    as a matter of illustration ,",
    "[ spiral ] shows the density profile of the dominating @xmath110 mode in model iii .",
    "this perturbation develops its usual behaviour , with a bar - shaped central part and losely wound spiral arms in the outer regions .",
    "the spiral structure is always found to be trailing .",
    "a big part of this article was devoted to the description of a method for finding linear modes in stellar disks .",
    "the proposed strategy heavily relies on existing techniques , such as the matrix method and fourier expansion along the unperturbed orbit , but differs from previous approaches by the fact that everything is calculated in ordinary coordinate and velocity space and that a numerical set of potential - density pairs is used . with the proposed scheme ,",
    "the full perturbed distribution function is obtained with no extra calculation costs . in this way we have shown",
    "that calculations in coordinate space , although much less suited for theoretical considerations , can offer a fast and flexible alternative to action - angle variables when it comes to numerical computation of normal modes .",
    "this method was applied to a set of unperturbed disk models , having a more or less realistic potential and an exponential mass density .",
    "this disks are embedded in a spherical , inert halo in order to obtain a self - consistent model . in agreement with various other studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", the calculations showed that these disks can be stabilised by increasing the velocity dispersion and/or the halo mass . for almost isotropic velocity dispersions , a @xmath190 value of @xmath191 turned out to be a reasonable stability limit .",
    "comparison of the stability of the present models with the behaviour of disks embedded in quadratic potentials ( @xcite ) shows a striking resemblance .",
    "qualitatively , the stability behaviour of those simple uniformly rotating systems shares all the features that we have found for the more sophisticated models discussed in this paper . and , to a certain degree , there is even a quantitative agreement .",
    "it seems that , for some important aspects of the stability behaviour , the structure of the unperturbed distribution might be more inportant than the nature of the unperturbed potential .",
