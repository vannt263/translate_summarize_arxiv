    "dilepton production has been proposed to serve as a penetrating probe for the hot and dense medium created in high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "their small final - state interaction cross sections let dileptons escape the interaction region undistorted .",
    "since   dileptons originate from all stages of a heavy ion reaction , their sources vary with the kinematic phase space under consideration : in the low mass region ( lmr : mass@xmath01.1gev/@xmath1 ) , vector mesons and direct photons are the dominating source , while dileptons in the intermediate mass region ( imr : 1.1@xmath0mass@xmath03gev/@xmath1 ) primarily stem from quack - gluon plasma(qgp ) thermal radiation and semileptonic decays of charmed mesons . in the high mass region ( hmr : mass@xmath23 gev/@xmath1 ) , heavy quark decays and drell - yan processes contribute the most to the dilepton spectrum . due to the time - energy correlation , the higher the dilepton pair mass , the earlier the production .",
    "therefore the dilepton distributions , especially in the imr and hmr , provide information on early collision dynamics in heavy ion collisions .    with the installation of the full barrel time - of - flight ( tof ) detector@xcite , the electron identification has been significantly improved at star , especially in the low momentum region . in this paper",
    ", we will present the first star results on dielectron production in au + au collisions at @xmath3 = 200 gev .",
    "the results are obtained from 200 gev au+au collisions , taken in 2010 .",
    "the main subsystems of the star detector@xcite used for this analysis are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the tof with 2@xmath4 azimuthal coverage at mid - rapidity .",
    "in addition to track detection and momentum determination capabilities , the tpc provides particle identification for charged particles by measuring their ionization energy loss ( @xmath5 ) in the tpc gas@xcite .",
    "the newly installed full barrel tof detector provides the particle velocity ( @xmath6 ) information@xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we combine tpc @xmath5 and tof @xmath6 information to identify electrons ( fig.[eid ] ) .",
    "the electron purity is @xmath7 in minimum - bias au + au analysis .",
    "the background is subtracted with the mixed - event and like - sign methods .",
    "the invariant mass distribution from event mixing agrees with the same - event unlike - sign distribution in the imr and hmr as shown in fig.[background ] ( left ) .",
    "the right plot shows the ratio of the like - sign and mixed - event background . in the lmr , due to the correlated background , from _",
    "e.g. _ cross pair and jet contribution@xcite , we subtract the like - sign background with an acceptance correction .",
    "the acceptance correction is needed because the acceptance of like sign pairs is slightly different from that of unlike sign pairs . in the imr",
    ", we use the mixed - event background@xcite since it offers better statistics .",
    "the systematic error in the lmr is dominated by the acceptance uncertainty ( @xmath8 ) . in the imr and hmr ,",
    "it is dominated by the normalization factor uncertainty from different normalization methods and the normalization region ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the dielecton continuum results in this paper are within star acceptance ( @xmath9 0.2 gev/@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and corrected for efficiency .",
    "fig.[auau ] shows the invariant mass spectra from 200 gev au + au minimum - bias ( left ) and central collisions ( right ) .",
    "the slope parameters at intermediate mass can be found in fig.[slope]@xcite .         used in this plot .",
    "( right ) transverse mass slope parameters from rhic and sps measurements.,width=283 ]    the results from p + p collisions are consistent with hadron decay cocktail simulations@xcite , which provide a baseline for au + au collisions .",
    "in the lmr we observe an enhancement with respect to the cocktail of @xmath13 ( without @xmath14 ) for central au - au collisions , while the enhancement is @xmath15 ( without @xmath14 ) for minimum bias collisions .",
    "the results are compared to different theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the calculation @xcite , which includes hadronic gas with medium modifications and radiation from the qgp , is compared to data in fig.[slope ] ( left ) and describes the data in reasonable way . also the phsd @xcite model , which includes several production mechanism as collisional broadening of vector mesons , microscopic secondary multiple - meson channels , radiation from the qgp , is able to describe the data .",
    "the data agree with the calculations that include the in - medium modification of the vector meson in lmr .    in the imr ,",
    "compared to minimum - bias collisions , the yield from binary - scaled charm contributions from pythia ( with charm cross section @xmath16 = 0.96 mb ) over - predicts the data in central collisions , which could indicate the modification of charm production in central au + au collisions . as shown in fig.[slope ] ( right ) , while the transverse mass slope parameters , which obtained from the transverse mass spectra@xcite , in p + p collisions are consistent with the pythia charm , they are different in au + au , since they are higher than those in p + p collisions .",
    "this may be due to thermal radiation and/or charm modification .",
    "we also compare our results with sps results .",
    "our inclusive dielectron slope parameters are higher than the sps dimuon results ( charm / dy contribution subtracted ) from na60 collaboration@xcite .    in the future , the heavy flavor tracker and muon telescope detector upgrades will help us to separate the charm and thermal radiation contributions .",
