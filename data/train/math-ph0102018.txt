    "the fact that quantum field theory came into being almost at the same time as quantum mechanics often lead people to believe that it is `` just a relativistic version of quantum mechanics '' . whereas it is true that both theories incorporated the general principles of quantum theory , the additional underlying structures , concepts and mathematical methods are remarkably different and this contrast manifests itself most visibly in the operator algebra formulation of local quantum physics ( lqp ) @xcite whereas their use in quantum mechanics would be an unbalanced formalistic exaggeration .",
    "this distinction is less evident if one employs the standard quantization formulation which has close links with differential geometry .",
    "mathematicians who were exposed to the mathematical aspects of some of the more speculative ideas in contemporary high - energy / particle theory ( supersymmetry , string theory , qft on noncommutative spacetime ) , which despite their mathematical attraction were unable to make contact with physical reality ( in some cases this worrisome situation already prevails for a very long time ) , often are not aware that quantum field theory ( qft ) stands on extremely solid rocks of experimental agreements . to give one showroom example of quantum electrodynamics i. e. the quantum field theory of electrons / positrons and photons , the experimental and theoretical values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron relative to the bohr magneton ( a natural constant )",
    "@xmath0 are @xmath1 where the larger theoretical error refers to the uncertainty in the knowledge of the value for the fine - structure constant and only the second uncertainty is related to calculational errors in higher order perturbative calculations .",
    "the precision list can be continued to quantum field theoretic effects in atomic physics as the lamb shift , and with somewhat lesser accuracy in the agreement with experiments may be extended to the electroweak generalization of quantum electrodynamics and remains qualitatively acceptable even upon the inclusions of the strong interaction of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "mathematician may even be less aware of the fact that only a few quantum field theoretician who have had their experience with the mathematical intricacies and conceptual shortcomings of the standard approach still believe that the present quantization approach ( which uses classical lagrangian and formal functional integrals as the definition of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) or the standard electroweak model ) has a mathematical existence outside perturbation theory , inspite of the mentioned amazing experimental agreement with perturbation theory .",
    "in fact there is hardly any theoretician who would be willing to take a bet about the mathematical existence of these lagrangian models .",
    "arguments to that extend are often presented in the physics literature by stating that `` qed does not exist '' .",
    "of course there is a theory involving electrons and photons ( even if we presently do not know its correct mathematical description ) and the critical arguments only go against the lagrangian / functional quantization definition of the theory and not against the underlying principles of lqp which in fact developed to a large degree from ideas about qed",
    ".    the cause of this critical attitude inspite of the overwhelming numerical success is twofold .",
    "on the one hand it is known that renormalized perturbation theory does not lead to convergent series in the coupling strength ; rather the series is at best asmptotically convergent i.e. the agreement with experiments would worsen if one goes to sufficiently high perturbative orders ( assuming that one could seperate out the contributions coming from interactions outside of qed ) .",
    "but there is also another more theoretical reason . to introduce interactions via polynomial pointlike coupling of free fields is pretty much ad hoc , i.e. if this recipe would not have worked , hardly anybody would have been surprised . in fact a sufficient intrinsic understanding of what constitutes interaction is the still missing cornerstone , even after 70 years of qft . only in recent years",
    "there have been serious attempts and partial successes on which we will comment in sections 3 and 4 of these notes .",
    "whereas in low spacetime dimensions ( d=1 + 1 , d=1 chiral models ) the mathematical existence of interacting quantum field theories has been demonstrated by the presentation of certain controllable models , 4-dimensional local quantum physics beyond free systems has largely resisted attempts at demonstrating existence via construction of nontrivial models or otherwise .",
    "this situation of having a perturbatively extremely successful description of particle physics whose existence as a bona fide qft on the other hand has remained outside mathematical control is quite unique and in fact without parallel in the history of physics .",
    "but it should not be viewed as something embarrassing to be suppressed or covered by excuses ( `` there has to be a cutoff at the plank length anyhow '' ) because this situation is also the source of fascination and a great challenge ; its enigmatic power should not be squandered . in the history of physics",
    "each conceptual framework ( classical mechanics , classical  field theory , statistical mechanics , quantum mechanics ) was eventually shown to be mathematically consistent ( usually by finding nontrivial models ) , i.e. the necessity of finding an incorporation into a more general framework was almost  never coming from mathematical inconsistencies , but either from new experimental facts or from the theoretical merger of two different frameworks ( example : relativity ) .",
    "if lqp build on einstein causality and quantum principles should really turn out to be mathematically inconsistent , this would constitute a remarkable and enigmatic piece of insight which should be made visible and not covered behind cut - offs .",
    "there is hardly any contrast in fundamental physics comparable to that between the verbal ease with which the word `` nonlocal '' is injected into discussions and on the other hand the conceptual problems faced in implementing nonlocality without destroying the whole fabric of an intrinsic interpretation of the formalism including the derivation of the all important scattering theory .",
    "for example string theory in its present formulation does not permit an intrinsic derivation of time - dependent scattering theory ( rather the s - matrix is imposed by the veneziano prescription ) .    despite 50 years of attempts to render short distance properties more mild by ad hoc nonlocal / noncausal modific]ations",
    "each proposal has proven to cause more problems then it set out to solve @xcite and it remains to be seen whether the proposals of achieving short distance improvements via noncommutativity of the spacetime localization pass the acid test of a complete physical interpretation which includes in particular the derivation of time dependent scattering theory .",
    "the general message in the many failed attempts is that principles as causality and locality can not be overcome by pedestrian ad hoc mathematical modifications , but rather require the discovery of more general physical principles of which they are limiting cases .",
    "the suggestion of the present lqp approach with respect to short distance problems is conservative or revolutionary depending on where one wants to put the emphasis ; conservative in that it does not temper with the causality principles and revolutionary in that it views the short distance problems as an aspect of the limitation of the quantization method using `` pointlike field coordinatizations '' ( akin to singular coordinates ) and not part of the intrinsic frontiers set by the principles but only of their implementation .    in pursuit of this challenge",
    "there have been new and deep conceptual and mathematical inroads and investments over the last two decades ; some of the older ones were described in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of those achievements obtained with operator algebra methods is , as already previously indicated , that they combine a revolutionary approach with respect to concepts and mathematical formalism with a conservative attitude concerning physical principles . in view of the fact that the very difficult and expensive high energy experiments did not reveal any indication of incompatibility with the general principles , this is a very reasonable procedure indeed .",
    "of course physicists need sometimes to move into the ( following feynman s saying ) `` blue yonder '' .",
    "but at times of poor experimental guidance , taking off without solid theoretical grounds under one s feet , such a trip may like that of the legendary flying dutchman end without finding a physical landing place over many generations .",
    "i think that the framework of algebraic quantum field theory on which these lectures are based offers such a firm soil . in particular it provides a profound mathematical anchor to the concept of einstein causality ( and the closely related haag duality ) in the form of the tomita - takesaki modular theory of operator algebras .",
    "this is of course welcome because it maintains the radical nature of such important future projects as the approach to quantum gravity by elevating it to its deserved conceptual distinguished position .    in my contacts with mathematicians",
    "i often encountered a strong curiosity about the motivations and history of the physical concepts behind the various formalisms . in these lectures",
    "i will try to pay attention to this legitimate desire .",
    "in the following i will give an exposition of some particle physics aspects of the operator algebra approach , but before i start to emphasize the differences to quantum mechanics , it is useful to present some concepts which actually originated there",
    ". we will freely use such acronyms as qm , qt , qft , aqft ( algebraic qft ) , lqp ( local quantum physics ) and oa ( operator algebras ) .",
    "it is helpful to recall briefly von neumann world of qm and the changes it suffered subsequently .",
    "von neumann form of qm was basically the quantum mechanics of a single particle and its mathematical formulation which was that of weyl s reformulation of heisenberg s commutation relation in the unitary exponential form ( for one degree of freedom ) @xmath2    &   = i\\hbar\\\\ w(\\alpha)w(\\beta )   &   = e^{-i(\\alpha,\\beta)}w(\\alpha+\\beta)\\nonumber\\\\ w(\\alpha )   &   = e^{i(\\alpha_{1}q+\\alpha_{2}p)},\\,(\\alpha,\\beta)=\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2}-\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{1}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this algebraic structure defines a unique @xmath3-algebra and the stone - von neumann theorem says that there is only one regular irreducible representation .",
    "as a consequence there is no loss of generality in the use of the schroedinger representation where pure states are represented by vectors ( modulo constant phase factors ) in the hilbert space of @xmath4-integrable wave functions and mixed state with density matrices ( positive trace - class operators ) .",
    "this simple situation leads to the standard hilbert space setting of qt . as von neumann pointed out",
    ", the irreducibility of the representation of the heisenberg - weyl algebra in which the observables correspond to hermitian operators leads to the unrestricted superposition principle : with two vectors describing physically realizable states also their linear combinations are physically realizable ( although in most cases , different from classical wave theory , one does not know from what source such a superposed state is produced ) .",
    "it was von neumann who emphasized this pivotal conceptual difference of quantum mechanics from classical wave optics , a difference which even in modern textbooks is often squandered for some superficial calculational gains which this conceptually incorrect analogy offers .    here it we should also recall another of von neumann s contributions to quantum theory , namely his famous relation of commuting operators and commutant algebras to commensurability of measurements .",
    "the totality of operators which commute with a given set of observables forms a _ weakly closed operator algebra _ which in von neumann s honor carries his name .",
    "they belong to the larger class of operator algebras which are closed with respect to the hermitian conjugation operation and the operator norm , whose abstract version ( forgetting the hilbert space ) is called @xmath3-algebra . although von neumann algebras are special @xmath3-algebras it would not be appropriate to subsume them under the heading of @xmath3-algebras .",
    "the von neumann algebra generated by an irreducible representation of the weyl algebra ( the @xmath3-algebra of quantum mechanics ) is @xmath5 , the algebra of all bounded operators in the hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "it gradually became clear that von neumann s mathematical framework of quantum mechanics , which admitted unrestricted coherent superposition of state vectors ( or equivalently gave the status of an observable to each selfadjoint operator ) , had to be amended in the presence of particles with different spin and of multiparticle states .",
    "there were certain superpositions of state vectors which can not be physically realized for geometric reasons .",
    "a historically famous example is that of wick wightman and wigner @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are wave function of a particle with halfinteger respectively integer spin , their coherent superposition @xmath9 which under the action of a @xmath10-rotation changes to @xmath11 can not carry a direct physical meaning since the expectation values of unrestricted observables from the algebra of all bounded operators in hilbert space @xmath5 are different in these two wave function .",
    "the observability of the relative phase in the change @xmath12 of @xmath13 , which is one of the most characteristic aspects of quantum theory , is prevented by the existence of a superselection rule : there is no observable @xmath14 which can connect halfinteger and integer spins @xmath15 in contrast to _ selection rules _ for e.g. electromagnetic transitions in atoms ( relating final with initial spin of the atomic state ) which suffer corrections in higher orders , these superselection rules are exact and therefore the prefix _ super _ has a sound physical meaning . in their presence the hilbert space @xmath16 becomes the direct sum of hilbert @xmath17 spaces inside which the unrestricted superposition principle holds @xmath18 the modern terminology is to call the labels @xmath19 summarily ( eigenvalues of ) superselection charges ( in the above example they are the @xmath20 univalence of spin ) .",
    "the algebra generated by the observables consists of a direct sum of algebras with no connecting operators between the different subspaces .",
    "the sum could in principle also be a continuous integral in which case the similarity with von neumann s central decomposition into factors is not accidental .",
    "another related important example comes from the notion of identical particles in multiparticle state vectors @xmath21 containing @xmath22 particles .",
    "permutations of particle labels in multiparticle states of identical particles can only change the representing state vector but not the associated physical state ( the expectation values of observables ) since they commute with the algebra @xmath23 generated by the observables @xmath24   = 0,\\,\\sigma\\in s_{n}\\\\ &   u(\\sigma)\\psi_{n}=\\psi_{n}^{\\sigma},\\,e_{\\psi_{n}}(a)=e_{\\psi_{n}^{\\sigma}}(a)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the different irreducible representations of the permutation group @xmath25 are conveniently depicted in terms of  young tableaus .",
    "the above commutation relations of permutations with observables which express the indistinguishability of identical particles impose a superselection rule between inequivalent representations belonging to different young tableaus . the standard argument in the qm literature to explain that _ only abelian permutation group representations _ are realized in nature is based on a fallacious tautology : it uses tacitly schur s lemma which is of course synonymous with the triviality of the commutant and hence with the claimed abelianess of the representations of permutations .",
    "a well - known mathematical counterexample is obtained by imagining a quantum mechanics in which the spin is not accessible to measurements .",
    "in such a world of hidden spin degrees of freedom the spatial wave functions belong to different symmetry - types with orbital young tableaus which are conjugate to the hidden n - particle spin young tableaus ( so that the antisymmetry refers to the tensor product space : orbitals@xmath26spin ) . since @xmath27 states n - particle belong to hight 2 tableaus , it is easy to see that the possible spin tableaus ( and therefore also the conjugate orbital ones ) are uniquely determined by the various values of the total spin .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the different symmetry types are generally different even without a spin dependent interaction . in this example",
    "the nonabelian `` parastatics '' of the different contributing permutation group representations can of course be reprocessed back into ordinary fermion statistics by reintroducing the spin multiplicity ( which was lost by assuming nonobservability i.e. averaging over spin degrees of freedom ) .",
    "but the general statement , that it is always possible to convert parastatistics into fermi / bose statistics ( plus multiplicities for an internal symmetry group to act on ) , is one of the most nontrivial theorems in particle physics . for its proof one",
    "needs the full power of the superselection theory in local quantum physics as well as some more recent group theoretical tools @xcite .    in local quantum physics ( lqp )",
    "superselected charges , despite their global aspects have a local origin which complies with the ( einstein- ) causality and spectral stability principles ; as in the classical theory of maxwell and einstein the global originates from the local .",
    "therefore `` topological field theories '' are not directly physical since they originate from lqp by ignoring localization aspects .",
    "the only way to interpret them physically is to remember the physical `` flesh '' of localization and transportability which was separated from these topological `` bones '' .",
    "a good example is provided by the reference endomorphisms and the intertwiner formalism of the next section ( and the ensuing markov traces on the infinite braid group which have a natural extension to the mapping class group and 3-manifold invariants ) .",
    "in fact topological field theories are only topological from a differential geometric viewpoint , whereas in lqp the terminology `` combinatorial '' would be more appropriate .",
    "in fact one could define lqp as being the theory of spacetime dynamics of local densities of superselected charges .",
    "it turns out that the localized version of these charges constitute the backbone of the observable algebra which , as we will see in more detail in the next section , is described by a map ( a net ) of spacetime regions into @xmath3- algebras . nothing turns out to be lost if we define this algebra in terms of its vacuum representation i.e. as a map into concrete operator algebras in a common hilbert space which contains a distinguished vacuum vector . on the present level of understanding of observable nets",
    "there is also no loss if we assume that the individual spacetime - indexed operator algebras are weakly closed i.e. are von neumann algebras .",
    "in fact the physically admissable representations of this algebra are just the localized representations of the observable vacuum net .",
    "apart from the above quantum mechanical superselection rules of multiparticle statistics and the before mentioned wick - wightman - wigner univalent spin superselection rules , the only other mechanism for encountering interesting superselection sectors in qm is by leaving the setting of schroedinger quantum mechanics and admitting topologically nontrivial configuration spaces .",
    "take for example quantum mechanics on a circle ( instead of a line ) or in more physical terms the aharonov - bohm effect i.e. the quantum physics in the vector potential associated with a stringlike idealized solenoid generating a @xmath28-function - like magnetic flux of strength @xmath29 through the x - y plane in the z - direction of the solenoid ( a situation which shares the same nontrivial topology with the circle ) .",
    "in this case the quantum mechanics is not unique but rather depends on an angle @xmath29 which in the a - b case has the physical interpretation of the magnetic strength .",
    "the intuitive reason ( which can be made mathematically rigorous ) is that if one realizes the maximal abelian subalgebra generated by the multiplication operator @xmath30 ( the angular coordinate ) on the space of periodic wave functions @xmath31 then the canonical conjugate p is equal to @xmath32 plus an operator which commutes with an irreducible system x and , p and hence is central - valued and therefore a numerical constant say @xmath29 in each irreducible representation , so that @xmath33 if the x - space would be the real axis , the @xmath34 can be transformed away by a nonsingular unitary `` gauge transformation '' but the topology prevents its elimination in this case",
    ". an equivalent formulation would be to keep the @xmath35 and @xmath36 as in the schroedinger representation and to encode the @xmath29 as a quasiperiodicity angle into wave functions ( which hereby turn into trivializing wave sections in a complex line bundle on the circle ) .",
    "but the way which would suit our present purpose ( which was to find illustrations of superselection rules in qm ) best would be to encode the quantum mechanics on the circle into an abstract ( @xmath29-independent ) @xmath3-algebra and have the @xmath29 appear as a representation label for the various irreducible hilbert space representations of this algebra .",
    "this can be done , but we will not pursue his matter , since our main interest is qft which offers a quite different mechanism for obtaining superselection - sectors as equivalence classes of irreducible representations of @xmath3algebras , namely the mechanism of infinite degrees of freedoms which will be illustrated in the sequel .",
    "let us look at a standard example ( following @xcite ) which requires only a modest amount of concepts from physics namely spins on a linear lattice , or mathematically a tensor product of an arbitrary large number @xmath22 of two - dimensional matrix - algebras @xmath37 here the right hand side is the physicists s notation for this complex algebra in terms of the three hermitian pauli matrices which together with the identity form a linear basis of the space @xmath38 . the pure states on this algebra are described in terms of the unit rays associated with hilbert space vectors in a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath39 in this simple case one even has an explicit parametrization of all density matrices ( mixed states ) in terms of a 3-dim .",
    "unit ball @xmath40 @xmath41 where the pure states reside on the surface of the unit ball .",
    "the object of our interest is the tensor product algebra @xmath42 acting irreducibly on the tensor hilbert space @xmath43 since we are interested in the `` thermodynamic '' ( inductive ) limit , we first define the infinite dimensional hilbert space in which the limiting algebra can act as an operator algebra @xmath44 i.e. we choose a ( nonseparable ) hilbert space spanned by a basis of binary sequences with the generators of the algebra being pauli - matrices labeled by the points of the linear chain @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath47 except for @xmath48 where @xmath49 although the limiting hilbert space is nonseparable , the inductive limit algebra @xmath23 remains separable and simple ( no ideals ) even after its uniform closure ( this is a rather general property of inductively defined limiting @xmath3-algebras ) ; a basis is given by @xmath50 i.e. a product of pauli - matrices at finitely many chain pointswhich acts on @xmath6 according to ( [ act ] ) .",
    "the big nonseparable hilbert space decomposes into a noncountable sum of separable hilbert spaces that are invariant under the @xmath23-action @xmath51   } h_{\\left [   s\\right ]   } \\\\",
    "h_{\\left [   s\\right ]   }   &   = \\overline{\\mathcal{a}\\left|   s\\right\\rangle } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one equivalence class evidently consists of binary sequences which have common two - sided `` tails '' @xmath52 if @xmath53 for sufficiently large @xmath54 by applying @xmath23 to a vector in @xmath55   } $ ] one can not change the two - sided `` tail '' i.e. @xmath56   \\neq\\left [   s^{\\prime}\\right]\\ ] ] a physicist would use the magnetization to show the presence of superselection rules ,",
    "e.g. he would consider the sequence of averaged magnetization in a piece of the chain of size 2n @xmath57 as a result of the decreasing pre - factor in the magnetization @xmath58 commutes for n@xmath59 with any basis element of @xmath60 since vectors @xmath61   } $ ] @xmath62 are eigenvectors of @xmath58 with eigenvalues @xmath63 we have @xmath64 this illustration shows clearly the mechanism by which infinitely many degree s of freedom generate superselection rules : there a too many different configurations at infinity which can not be connected by operators from the quasilocal @xmath23 ( the uniform limit of local operations ) ; whereas the @xmath20 magnetization ( and certain others as alternating anti - ferromagnetic states ) sectors with respect to a chosen spin quantization direction ( in our case the 3-direction ) have a clearcut physical meaning and can take on the role of ground state vectors of suitably chosen dynamical systems with ( anti)ferromagnetic interactions , this is not the case for most of the myriads of other sectors .",
    "this also makes clear that infinite degrees of freedom in quantum systems do not only lead to inequivalent representations , but also that there are far too many of them in order to be physically relevant .",
    "one needs a selection principle as to what states are of physical interest . in particle physics einstein causality of the observable algebra and a suitable definition of localization of states relative to a reference state ( the vacuum )",
    "constitute the cornerstone of what is often appropriately referred to as `` local quantum physics '' ( lqp ) .",
    "how to prove theorems and derive significant results in such a framework will be explained in the second lecture . whereas the topological superselections in qm which we illustrated by the aharonov - bohm model ( mathematically the qm on a circle ) are the result of an over - idealization ( infinitely thin stringlike solenoids , in order to reach mathematical simplicity - angle . ] ) , the so - called vacuum polarization nature of the all - pervading vacuum reference state makes the infinite degree of freedom aspect of lqp an immutable physical reality . in the scaling limit of lqp which leads to conformal quantum field theory ,",
    "there is also a topological aspect which enters through the compactification of minkowski spacetime and the ensuing structure of the algebra ( see the third section ) . but this mechanism is quite different and more fundamental than the over - idealizations of the aharonov - bohm solenoid .",
    "the typical situation is that the @xmath3-algebra @xmath23 describing the observables of a system in lqp has a denumerable set of superselection sectors and that the full hilbert space which unites all representations is a direct sum @xmath65 this decomposition is reminiscent of the decomposition theory of group algebras of compact groups apart from the fact that for the superselection sectors in lqp there exist `` natural '' intertwining operators which transfer superselection charges and connect the component spaces @xmath66 ( this has no analog in group theoretic representation theory ) .",
    "they are analogous to creation and annihilation operators in fock space which intertwine the different n - particle subspaces .",
    "even though they themselves are not observables , they are nevertheless extremely useful .",
    "the best situation one can hope for is to have a full set of such operators which create a field algebra @xmath67 in with no further inequivalent representations i.e. in which all representation labels ( `` charges '' ) have become inner ( charges within the field algebra ) .",
    "note that the word `` field '' in this context does not necessarily refer to pointlike operator - valued distributions @xcite but rather to the charge - transfer aspect of charge carrying operators which intertwine between different superselection sectors wheras the observables by definition stay in one sector .",
    "doplicher and roberts @xcite proved that observable algebras in four spacetime dimensions indeed allow a unique construction ( after imposing the conventions of `` normal commutation '' relations between operators carrying different superselected charges @xcite ) of such a field algebra @xmath67 from its observable `` shadow '' @xmath23 .",
    "this ( re)construction of @xmath67 from @xmath23 is therefore reminiscent of marc kac s famous aphorism about a mathematical inversion problem which goes back to hermann weyl namely : `` how to hear the shape of a drum ? ''",
    "the most startling aspect of their result is that the inclusion ] of the two nets @xmath68 ( apart from low - dimensional qft ) is completely characterized by the category of compact groups and that for each compact topological group there is a pair ( @xmath69 ) within the setting of lqp which has the given group @xmath70 as the fixed point group of @xmath67@xmath71 this equality also holds for each algebra in the net i.e. @xmath72    this observation goes a long way to _ de - mystify the concept of inner symmetries _ ( `` inner '' in the physicists sense refers to symmetries related to superselected charges which commute with spacetime symmetries , whereas operator algebraist use inner / outer for unitarily implementable / nonimplementable auto- or endo- morphisms ) which originated from heisenberg s phenomenological introduction of isospin in nuclear physics and played a pivotal role through its group action on multiplicity indices of multicomponent lagrangian fields .",
    "what results is an ( presumably even for mathematicians ) unexpected new road to group theory and group representations @xcite via a `` group dual '' which is very different from that of the well - known tanaka - krein theory .",
    "the dr form of the group dual in turn emerges from the dhr superselection sector analysis , i.e. from an input which consists only of einstein causality ( known to mathematicians through its classical manifestation from relativistic wave propagation in the context of partial differential equation ) and spectral stability ( energy positivity ) .    in lqp of lower spacetime dimensions the rigid separation between spacetime and inner symmetries",
    "looses its meaning ) with b / f statistics inner ( compact group ) and outer ( spacetime ) symmetries can not be nontrivially `` married '' @xcite , in low dimensions they can not be unequivocally `` divorced '' . ] and one is entering the realm of subfactor theory of v. jones ( which in a certain sense constitutes an extension of group theory ) , with braid group statistics being the main physical manifestation . again a short interlude concerning the physicists use of the word `` statistics '' may be helpful .",
    "historically the main physical manifestation of the difference between spacelike commuting boson and anticommuting fermi fields ( or between ( anti)symmetrized multiparticle tensor product spaces ) was observed in the thermodynamical behavior resulting from statistical ensembles of such particles i.e. from their statistical mechanics . even in situations",
    "in which there is no statistical mechanics involved , physicist continue to use the word `` statistics '' for the characterization of commutation relations of the fields which describe those particles .    here",
    "it is helpful to remember a bit of history on the mathematical side .",
    "group theory originated from galois studies of inclusion of a ( commutative ) number field into an extended field ( extended by the roots of a polynomial equation ) .",
    "the new subfactor theory in some way generalizes this idea to inclusions of particular families of nonabelian algebras . at the threefold junction between abstract quantum principles ,",
    "the geometry of spacetime and inner symmetries stands one of the most startling and impressive mathematical theories : the tomita - takesaki modular theory , which in the more limited context of thermal aspects of open quantum systems was independently discovered by physicists @xcite .",
    "it is , according to the best of my knowledge , the only theory capable to convert abstract domains of quantum operators and ranges of operator algebras within the algebra of all bounded operators @xmath5 of the underlying hilbert space into geometry and spacetime localization ; and although this is not always obvious , this is also behind the geometrical aspects of subfactor theory .",
    "the standard hilbert space setting which one learns in a course of qm is only a sufficient tool if the algebraic structure of observables allows for only one ( regular ) representation as the p s and q s ( encoded into the weyl c@xmath73-algebra of qm ) .",
    "whereas it is possible to present the standard particle theory in terms of computational recipes in this restricted setting ( as it is in fact done in most textbooks ) , the extension of lqp into yet unexplored directions of particle physics requires a somewhat broader basis , including additional mathematical concepts .    in passing we mention that superselection rules also play a role in an apparently quite different area of fundamental quantum physics .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the schrdinger cat paradox of qm ( which is a dramatic setting of the von neumann `` reduction of the wave packet '' dictum ) becomes more palatable through the idea of a decoherence process in time which is driven by an environment i.e. there is a transition process in time from a pure quantum state of the object to a mixed ( in a classical sense ) state , and that for all practical purposes the coherence in the superposition @xmath74 will have been lost in the limit of infinite time as a result of interactions with the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment . ignoring the environment and the decoherence time , this takes on the form of the von neumann wave packet collapse @xmath75{c}p\\psi\\,with\\,\\;prob.\\,\\left\\|   p\\psi\\right\\|   ^{2}\\,\\,or\\\\ \\left (   1-p\\right )   \\psi\\,with\\,\\,prob.\\,\\left\\|   \\left (   1-p\\right ) \\psi\\right\\|   ^{2}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where for simplicity we assumed that the observable is a projection operator @xmath76 the mixed state on the right hand side has been represented as a mixture of two orthogonal components , but unlike a pure state a mixture has myriads of other ( nonorthogonal ) representations and it is not very plausible that in addition to the collapse into a mixed state , the measurement also selects that orthogonal representation of the mixture among the myriads of other possibilities .",
    "rather one believes that the measurement causes an interaction with the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment ( the finite degrees of freedom of a quantum mechanical object may itself be the result of an idealization )  and that what is observed at the end is a mixture of superselected states of the big system .",
    "since the central decomposition in contrast to the aforementioned orthogonal mixture has an unambiguous classical meaning , this is the more satisfactory explanation of the decoherence process at infinite times @xcite . whereas it is quite easy to write down unitary time propagators which become isometric in the limit ( or positive maps which generate mixtures already in finite time ) , it is a much more difficult task to create a realistic infinite degree of freedom model which describes the above features of a measurement process in a mathematically controllable way .",
    "there is as yet no agreement about whether the full system ( including the spacetime of the part of the universe which is spacelike separated from the laboratory during the finite duration of the measurement ) remains in a pure state or undergoes a `` reduction '' into a mixture ; it is not even clear whether this question belongs still to physics or is of a more philosophical nature .",

    "it seems that some of the oldest problems in quantum theory related to the quantum mechanical measurement process is still very much alive and that as a result of the importance of an infinite degree of freedom environment and locality , the theory of local quantum physics ( which automatically generates the omnipresent environment of the spacelike separated infinite degree of freedom via the vacuum polarization property ) may yet play an important role in future investigations .",
    "it should be clear from this birds eye view of motivation and content of lqp that the properly adapted einstein causality concept , which in its classical version originated at the beginning of the last century , still remains the pillar of the present approach to particle physics . with its inexorably related vacuum polarization structure and the associated infinite number of degrees of freedom it has given lqp its distinct fundamental character which separates it from qm . despite its startling experimentally verified predictions and despite theoretical failures of attempts at its nonlocal modifications , its conceptual foundations for 4-dimensional interacting particles are presently still outside complete mathematical control .      as a mathematical illustration of superselection rules we are going to explain the representation theory of  ( finite ) group algebras using the setting of superselection sectors",

    "the nontrivial miraculous properties of this decomposition are the existence of an automorphism @xmath508 which propagates operators within @xmath23 and only depends on the state @xmath160 ( and not on the implementing vector @xmath509 and a that of an antiunitary involution @xmath506 which maps @xmath23 onto its commutant @xmath510 the theorem of tomita assures that these objects exist in general if @xmath511 is a cyclic and separating vector with respect to @xmath60 an important thermal aspect of the tomita - takesaki modular theory is the validity of the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) boundary condition @xcite @xmath512 i.e. the existence of an analytic function @xmath513 holomorphic in the strip @xmath514 and continuous on the boundary with @xmath515 the fact that the modular theory applied to the wedge algebra has a geometric aspect ( with @xmath506 equal to the tcp operator times a spatial rotation and @xmath516 ) is not limited to the interaction - free theory @xcite .",

    "the optimal noncompact localization properties of the famous wigner continuous spin positive energy representations have not been investigated .",
    "whether one can relate physically acceptable objects with these irreducible wigner representations depends very much on the answer to the best possible localization properties .",
    "it is easy to see that for any case s@xmath526integer there is a mismatch between the geometrically opposite and the symplectic opposite i.e. @xmath527 one needs an additional `` twist '' @xmath360 in order to transform one into the other .",
    "the distinction between the geometric and the symplectic opposite in @xmath464 i.e. the appearance of @xmath360  is also the reason why the weyl functor is only appropriate for integer spin . for halfinteger spin",

    "the fock space version of the multiplication with @xmath19 turns out to be the twist operator appearing in the dhr work on fermions @xcite .",
    "but whereas for s = halfinteger this twist does not force the compact localization spaces to be trivial and only changes the multiparticle symmetrized tensor products into the antisymmetric ones , the twist for anyonic spin has quite different more dramatic consequences for the localization and the multiparticle structure . as we have already seen the localization can not be better than semiinfinite string - like and as far as the multiparticle structure is concerned one can show that it can not be described by a tensor product at all if one wants sharper than wedge localizations .",
    "this follows from a no - go theorem by @xcite who proved that spacelike cone localized anyonic fields which have nonvanishing matrix elements between the vacuum and the anyonic spin one - particle state and fulfill braid group commutation relations ( which they are required to do by the general spin - statistics theorem ) can not be fields which applied to the vacuum create a pure one - particle state vector without the admixture of vacuum polarization components . in the terminology of the last section",
    "one may say there are no spacelike cone localized anyonic pfg s .",
    "such one particle creating operators only exist for the larger wedge localization , a fact which strongly suggest to use the wigner description only for the construction of the wedge algebras of `` free '' anyons and use those to descend to smaller localizations by the method of intersections .",
    "normally the presence of these particle - antiparticle `` clouds '' in addition to one - particle components are thought of as a characteristic property of the interaction , but here they are caused by the braid group statistics even in the absence of genuine interactions .",
    "the distinction of _ free versus interacting _ based on lagrangian quantization is clearly not very appropriate in such a situation .",
    "it is of paramount importance to explicitly construct these free anyonic fields for a given spin - statistics structure . even though they are like boson / fermion fields uniquely determined by their wigner particle structure , some of the conceptual problems in their explicit construction are still open .",
    "their physical importance results from the fact that besides braid group statistics and the related quantum symmetries there is nothing else which distinguishes lqp in low dimensions from fermions / bosons in d@xmath5291 + 2 .",
    "the nonrelativistic limit does not eradicate the braid group statistics inasmuch as the fermi / bose alternative and the spin - statistics connection is not lost in this limit . hence d=1",
    "+ 2 braid group statistics particles can not be descibed by qm even if one is only interested in their nonrelativistic behavior .",
    "the complementary statement ( which sounds more provocative ) would be to say that qm of bosons / fermions owes its physical relevance to the fortuitous fact that there are relativistic fields ( namely ordinary free fields ) which create one - particle state vectors without any vacuum polarization admixture .",
    "so if the new phenomena of high @xmath530-superconductivity and the fractional quantum hall effect are characteristic for low ( two spatial ) dimensions they should be related to the braid group spin - statistics structure and hence outside the range of the standard lagrangian quantization approach .",
    "the appearance of amplification factors from statistical dimension for plektons ( of potential use for high @xmath530 ) and rational statistical phases ( of potential use in the fractional hall effect ) are very encouraging , but there is still a long way to go before the quantum field theory of anyons / plektons and their electromagnetic couplings to external fields is understood on the level of say the understanding of the electromagnetic properties of dirac fermions .",
    "the present understanding of the fractional hall effect has been obtained via the `` edge current '' approximation in which the fractional statistics effect enters via the simpler statistics structure of chiral theories .    in the presence of interactions ,",
    "the structure of the wedge algebras is not only determined by the wigner theory but the s - matrix also enters in the characterization of wedge - localized state vectors .",
    "there exist however wedge - localized operators which , if only applied once to the vacuum , create a one - particle state vector ; whereas for any smaller localization region this would not be compatible with the presence of interactions unless there are in addition vacuum polarization clouds . in certain interacting cases in low spacetime dimensions the `` polarization free generators '' ( pfg s ) have nice ( temperedness ) analytic properties which keep them close to free systems ; in fact their fourier transforms obey a faddeev - zamolodchikov algebra . in the last section we will explain this situation in some more detail .    in passing we briefly remind the reader of the standard way of combining the wigner particle picture with einstein causality through the introduction of pointlike covariant `` field coordinatizations '' .",
    "the covariant field construction is synonymous with the introduction of intertwiners between the unique wigner @xmath487 representation and the multitude of lorentz - covariant momentum - dependent spinorial ( dotted and undotted ) tensors , which under the homogenous l - group transform with the irreducible @xmath531   } ( \\lambda)$ ] matrices .",

    "since the range of the @xmath14 and @xmath242 ( undotted / dotted ) spinors is arbitrary apart from the fact that they must fulfil the inequality ( [ 2 ] ) with respect to the given physical spin s , the number of covariant fields is countably infinite .",

    "so the extension into an ambient world are not described by standard field degrees of freedom ( for a more see the last section ) .",
    "another problem which even in the wigner setting of noninteracting particles has not yet been solved is the pre - modular theory for disconnected or topologically nontrivial regions e.g. in the simplest case for disjoint double intervals of the massless s=@xmath553 model on the circle .",

    "whereas in higher dimension the characteristic initial value problem is uniquely defined by giving data on one lightfront only , for d=1 + 1 one needs the characteristic data on the right and left lightray in order to have a unique specification throughout spacetime .",
    "this leads to the well - known doubling of degrees of freedom : the general wave solution in massless d=1 + 1 consists of right- and left- moving chiral contributions .",
    "the starting point of the chiral factorization of d=1 + 1 massless conformal qft is the observation that the conformal group @xmath758 factorizes into two @xmath759 one then naturally expects that the subtheories which commute with the left / right moebius group @xmath760 are the two chiral components into which the theory tensor - factorizes , a fact which one can rigorously prove in the lop setting @xcite @xmath761 where the last line is the factorization of the compactification on which the @xmath762 acts independently on each factor .",

    "fields which depend holomorphically on complex coordinates @xmath772 as they appear sometimes in the literature on chiral qft and in string theory , are meaningless since analytic properties are not part of the operator algebra but enter through states and manifest themselves in state vectors and vacuum correlation functions ; in thermal representations of the same operator algebra they are completely different",

    "the previous decomposition theory of fields on the covering ( [ ex ] ) only involves positive / negative lightlike distances and the compatibility problem between space- and time - like algebraic structure is absent .",

    "the ordering structure on a light ray does not only permit the more general braid group structure instead of the usual permutation group , but one can even proof that a chiral model with only ( anti)commuting fields is associated to a free field theory in fock space .",

    "\\2 ) how does one use these data for the construction of d=1 + 1 conformal field theories ?",
    "the attentive reader will notice that the first question implies a change of strategy . whereas for the structural analysis of lqp it was advantageous to start with the observable algebra in order to classify the admissable superselection structures and in particular the admissible ( braid group ) statistics , for the actual construction of models it may turn out to be easier to look directly for the spacetime carriers of the superselection charges without constructing first the observable algebras .",
    "this is precisely the message from the interaction free case since the free fields themselves are more easily constructed ( see the second section ) than their associated local observables which usually are given in terms of local composites . for",
    "chiral theories in particular this would mean to look for an alternative method to the construction of anomalous dimensional fields than that via representation theory of current algebras .    whereas the first problem is still at the beginning of its understanding ( see remarks in next section ) ,",

    "it is part of a general extension problem of @xmath777 in this case of the extensions of endomorphisms on @xmath23 to endomorphisms on @xmath236 .      up to now",
    "we were not completely precise about in what mathematical way a global algebra with its localizable representations and endomorphisms should be related to the net of local algebras .",
    "this cavalier attitude did not cause any problem as long as the local algebras were indexed by double cones ( more general compact regions ) in minkowski spacetime . in this case",
    "the system of local algebras is really a bona fide net in the strict mathematical sense since two double cones are always contained in a sufficiently large third double cone i.e. the local system is directed towards infinity .",

    "the holographic image is not a chiral conformal theory in the usual sense of zero mass physics with an associated characteristic energy - momentum tensor and an ensuing virasoro - algebra ( on which the opposite light cone translation would act trivially ) , but rather a @xmath992 invariant theory with _ additional automorphisms with `` fuzzy '' actions _ in terms of the chiral net indexing .",
    "the holographic projection contains the same informations as the original two - dimensional net in particular their is no change of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the lowering of the spacetime dimension in the holographic process is accompanied by the conversion of some of the originally geometric automorphisms into fuzzy ones .",
    "these properties are very important if one uses lightray quantization ( or the infinite momentum frame method ) .",
    "the original local information gets completely reprocessed and the reconstruction of the two - dimensional local quantum physics from its lightray quantization description is a nontrivial task .",
    "this idea of holographic encoding also works in higher spacetime dimensions . in that case the formal analog of the lightray theory @xmath991 would be a @xmath993-dimensional lightfront net .",
    "one again starts with a modular inclusion of wedges by a lightlike translation .",
    "however this does not yet create a net on the lightfront horizon of the wedge .",
    "it turns out that the missing transversal net structure can be created by d-2 carefully selected additional l - boosts .",
    "the best way of describing the result is actually not in terms of a d-1 dimensional holographic lightfront net , but rather as a `` scanning '' of the original theory in terms of an abstract chiral theory which is brought into d-1 scanning positions in the same hilbert space @xcite .",
    "there is one very peculiar case of this holographic association of a theory with a lower dimensional one : the famous @xmath994-@xmath995 relation ( a correspondence between the so called anti desitter spacetime manifold in d+1 and conformal field theory in d spacetime dimension ) . in this case",
    "the maximal symmetry groups namely so(d,2 ) are the same and in particular the phenomenon of certain geometrically acting automorphisms turning fuzzy in the holographic image is absent .",
    "furthermore the correspondence is not related to lightfront horizons and modular inclusions ; it is the only known `` sporadic '' case of holography based on shared maximal symmetry which is intimately related to the d+2 dimensional linear formalism which one uses to conformally compactify the d - dimensional minkowski space @xcite .",
    "although it is an isomorphism between two qfts , its existence was first conjectured in the setting of string theory @xcite .",
    "the rigorous proof in the setting of lqp @xcite leads to a correspondence which deviates in one point from the way the original conjecture in the field theoretic setting was formulated in some publications .",
    "there the correspondence was thought to be one between two lagrangian field theories i.e. two quantum field theories which have a presentation in terms of covariant pointlike fields .",
    "this is however not true , inasmuch as it is not the case in the previous modular inclusion - based holography ( where this is obvious since the original geometric symmetry gets lost in the holographic projection ) .",
    "one really needs the field coordinate independent lqp setting of nets of operator algebras also in the ads - cqft relation @xcite .",
    "intuitively one of course expects this , since the content of an isomorphism between theories in different spacetime dimensions can not be described in terms of pointlike maps . using concepts from physics",
    "one realizes that a conformal theory which fullfils in addition to the already mentioned ( see previous section ) causality properties the requirement of primitive causality ( the causal shadow property ) which is the local quantum physical adaptation of a dynamical propagation law in time ( i.e. of a classical hyperbolic differential equation ) , then the algebraic net of the canonically associated ads theory can not be generated by pointlike fields . rather the best localized generators which the ads theory possesses are `` strands '' which intersect in a pointlike manner the conformal boundary of ads at infinity .",
    "string theorist would perhaps say at this point that this is what they would have expected anyhow , but unfortunately these stringlike configurations extending into the bulk do not increase the number of degrees of freedom which the dynamical strings of string theory proper would do ( this is the reason for calling tem `` stands '' ) .",
    "on the other hand these ads strands are really strings in the sense of lqp localization , whereas localization in the target - space formalism of string theory has remained one of the most inconclusive and obscure issues .",
    "opposite to the discussed situation is the one where one starts with a pointlike field situation in ads .",
    "then the associated cqft violates the causal shadow property : as one moves up into the causal shadow region of a piece of a ( thin ) timeslice there are more and more degrees of freedom entering from the ads bulk .",
    "the d+1 dimensional ads theory generated by pointlike fields contains too many degrees of freedom which destroy the equality between the algebra indexed by a connected spacetime region @xmath249 and the algebra indexed by its causal completion ( = causal shadow ) @xmath996 since the ads spacetime from the point of view of particle physics is an auxiliary concept , it is more reasonable to relax particle physics requirement on the ads side than on the conformal side ; after all conformal theories are thought of as the scaling limit of massive physical theories .",
    "this brings up the interesting question whether there are qfts , which even after holographic unfolding ( reprocessing into higher dimensions by changing the spacetime net indexing or by giving a spaetime meaning to a fuzzy subalgebra ) do not allow an interpretation in terms of pointlike field coordinatization , i.e. _ which are intrinsically operator - algebraic and not even formally obtainable by lagrangian quantization . _ the general answer to this question is not known , but for conformal theories a pointlike field coordinatization is always possible . for chiral theories proofs",
    "have been published @xcite and there is no reason for thinking that these methods are limited to low dimensions .",
    "my personal opinion is that there may exist massive lqp theories which do not violate known physical principles and which do not allow a complete description in terms of pointlike fields .",
    "it is interesting to note that there exist relations between qfts on spacetimes with the same dimensionality which , although not requiring the use of modular inclusions , share the aspect of fuzzyness ( hidden symmetries ) of certain automorphisms .",
    "a nice illustration of such a `` transplantation '' was recently given in @xcite .",
    "the authors start with a qft on 4-dim .",
    "desitter spacetime which is the submanifold @xmath997",
    "they then show that the so called robertson - walker spacetime ( rw ) in a certain parameter range has an isometric embedding into ds .",
    "although this does not lead to transformation formulas for pointlike fields , it does allow to transplant the family of algebras of double - cone shaped regions on ds to corresponding ( using the embedding ) regions on rw .",
    "as one expects from a map which can not be expressed in terms of pointlike fields , part of the geometrical so(4,1 ) ds symmetry becomes fuzzy after the rw transplantation .",
    "these hidden symmetries are pure `` quantum '' and would not be there at all in the ( semi)classical rw theory .",
    "apparently the transplanted theory fulfills all the physical requirements presented in the second section ( adapted to curved spacetime ) .",
    "the ( mem)brane idea consists in studying a theory which results from restricting a given theory to a spacetime submanifold containing the time axis by fixing one spatial coordinate .",
    "this is of course perfectly legitimate as an auxiliary mathematical device . if however one wants to attribute a physical reality to the restricted as well as to the ambient theory ( which includes the requirement of the causal shadow property ) , one faces a similar problem as in the ads - cqft discussion above .",
    "the causal shadow property prevents to have pointlike fields in both cases ; if the brane theory is generated by pointlike fields , these pointlike fields develop into transversal strands ( which do not depend on the transversal coordinates ) in the ambient theory and these stringlike configurations do not increase the degree of freedoms , they lack the dynamical aspects of string theory .",
    "the problem with the kaluza - klein limit is more severe , since the attempt to reduce the number of spatial dimensions by making them compact and then letting their size go to zero will create uncontrollable vacuum fluctuations .",
    "not only quantities as those which feature in the casimir effect will diverge , but there is not even a good reason to believe that the vacuum state on the ambient algebra will stay finite on any local operator in the kaluza - klein limit .",
    "operator methods are better suited to make this difficulty visible than lagrangian quantization which especially in its functional action form is formally closer to semiclassical aspects . in the quantization approach it tends to be overlooked because the kaluza - klein reduction is made on the quantization level before the actual model calculations ( and hence the memory of the ambient spacetime is lost ) , instead of first computing the correlation functions of the ambient theory and then taking the k - k limit .",
    "most of the problems touched upon in this section belong to the `` unfinished business '' of particle physics , whereas section 2 and part of section 3 ( in particular the dhr theory ) consists of material with a well - understood and firm mathematical and conceptual position .",
    "we included some `` unfinished business''in these notes in order to counteract the widespread impression that operator algebra methods are limited to formulate already understood aspects of local quantum physics in a more rigorous fashion .",
    "the aim of these lectures is to convince mathematicians that not only are operator algebra methods useful for their innovative power in problems of local quantum physics , but also that some of the concepts coming from lqp have left their mark on mathematics .",
    "this can be seen e.g. by the many contributions coming from lqp which preceeded discoveries in subfactor theory .",
    "although our main motivation and illustrations of modular inclusions were related to lqp , there have also been interesting recent applications of modular inclusions to noncommutative dynamical ( anosov- and k- ) systems @xcite .    on the physical side the presently most promising ideas in my view",
    "are related to the ongoing development of modular theory .",
    "concepts as modular inclusions are the first steps towards a seemingly very deep connection between the relative positioning of copies of one abstract operator algebra in one common hilbert space and more geometrical spacetime properties and ( finite or infinite dimensional ) lie groups which are generated by the modular groups of the various standard pairs ( algebra , state vector ) which can be associated with such situations .",
    "apart from the action of poincar / conformal groups there are infinitely many modular actions which are `` fuzzy '' i.e. their local action on an algebra associated with a region can not be encoded into a diffeomorphism .",
    "these actions are totally `` quantum '' i.e. they do not exist in classical theory and hence remain hidden in quantization procedures .",
    "hitherto `` fuzziness '' of spacetime aspects was mostly noticed in connection with `` noncommutative qft '' ( the noncommutativity referring to spacetime ) , but here we met this behavior without changing any of the underlying principles as soon as we use methods which allow us to go beyond the confinements of the lagrangian approach . with other words",
    "the use of oa - methods in qft emulates some of the properties which result from noncommutative qft .",
    "another problem which in my view can only be solved by operator algebra methods is to obtain an intrinsic understanding of _ interactions _ independent of field coordinatizations and their short distance behavior .",
    "in fact the physical leitmotiv underlying these lectures is _ how to adapt wigner s ideas with the help of tomita s modular theory to the realm of interactions_.    as mentioned , the modular methods tend to be more noncommutative than the standard methods although the noncommutative aspects are resulting from the same physical principles which underlie the standard approach .",
    "an example of this is the program of constructing the multiparticle spaces and interpolating fields for d=1 + 2 wigner particles with braid group statistics using modular wedge localization as presented in section 2.2 . in the standard setting the only lagrangians which have a chance to have a relation with braid group statistics are those containing chern - simons terms , but the whole setup starting from euclidean actions is too commutative to produce the real - time vacuum expectations of products of the spacetime carriers of these plektonic charges . in order to counteract this",
    "there have been attempts to change the classical spacetime to something noncommutative @xcite .",
    "the operator algebra approach would not change the classical spacetime structure which enters as the indexing of the net of algebras in agreement with the physical idea that the physics of d=1 + 2 plektons is laboratory physics and not quantum gravity .",
    "it would rather attempt to unravel noncommutative aspects of lqp by changing lagrangian methods by modular constructions .    on almost all issues considered in these notes",
    "the operator algebra framework offers a more conservative alternative than the more artistic ( outside of perturbation theory ) lagrangian approach .",
    "in particular the underlying philosophy of lqp is not that of a search for better lagrangians but rather that of unfolding and sharpening of physical principles . in that respect",
    "it is closer in spirit to condensed matter physics where one deemphasizes individual hamiltonians in favor of the notion of universality classes ( equivalence classes which share certain structural aspects , the most prominent being short distance class ) .",
    "last not least there are of course also strong inner - mathematical reasons for studying ideas about noncommutative geometry which are also related to the use of operator algebras @xcite",
    ". it would be nice if there also would exist compelling physical reasons for a direct connection between particle physics and noncommutative geometry .",
    "the present problem with such a program is that the algebraic smoothness which distinguishes noncommutative geometry from @xmath3- or von neumann algebras does not seem to be related to the smoothness / analyticity of physical correlation functions @xcite ( which is already accounted for by the von neumann algebra nets of aqft ) .",
    "furthermore the use of noncommutative spacetime for the control of ultraviolet divergencies in laboratory ( i.e. excluding quantum gravity ) particle physics seems to be far - fetched in view of the fact that more conservative ideas as the modular localization structure contain the very strong message that the ultraviolet problem as we know it may well be a fake of singular field coordinatization which the lagrangian quantization formalism enforces upon us .    *",
