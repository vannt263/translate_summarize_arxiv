    "in recent years interest on dna mediated charge migration has enhanced remarkably because its potential for the development of new generation dna - based nanoelectronic devices and computers .",
    "also in biology , a precise understanding of the mechanism of electron transport along dna could play an important role for the description of the processes like damage sensing , protein binding , gene regulation , cell division , etc .",
    "however , the question that does dna conduct electron is quite intriguing to the physicists as well as biologists , and , even today the electronic and transport properties of dna are not well understood .",
    "inspite of the current intense debate , the electron transport properties of dna were being addressed soon after the discovery of the double helix structure of dna by watson and crick  @xcite .",
    "eley and spivey  @xcite first suggested that dna could behave like an electric conductor .",
    "more recently with the advent of measurements on single dna molecule , kelley _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that dna behaves like a conducting molecular wire .",
    "but a number of conflicting experimental results  @xcite and a variety of theoretical models  @xcite appeared in the literature .",
    "experiments on periodic double stranded poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna sequence reported both conducting  @xcite as well as semiconducting  @xcite behavior .",
    "measurements on aperiodic @xmath1-phage dna sequence suggested that it could be metallic  @xcite , superconducting  @xcite at low temperature or insulating  @xcite .",
    "unambiguous and reproducible experimental results are still a great technological challenge due to the complexity of environment , thermal vibrations , contact resistance and sequence variability of the dna molecules . on the other hand , lack of clear understanding of charge transfer mechanism in dna",
    "leads to various phenomenological models in which charge transport is mediated by polarons  @xcite , solitons  @xcite , electrons or holes  @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties and the conducting behavior of dna thus remain highly controversial and ref .",
    "@xcite provides an excellent review on this issue .    in order to explain the diverse experimental results",
    ", one should consider three different contributions that are present in an experiment with dna , namely , the sequence of the pairs of nucleotides(_i.e .",
    "_ , base - pairs ) in dna , the presence of backbones and the influence of environment .",
    "the environment in turn pieces out into three main parts , the substrate on which experiments are performed , the surrounding temperature  @xcite and the humidity . as the sugar - phosphate backbones are negatively charged and hanging outside the double - helix structure of dna",
    ", they can easily interact with the substrate and the effective on - site energies of the backbone get modulated to a great extent  @xcite .",
    "the experiments with dna are performed mostly in two different conditions : _ i _ ) in natural aqueous buffer solutions , and _ ii _ ) in dry conditions . in dna s natural aqueous buffer solution",
    ", the backbone phosphates usually attract counter - ions and polar water molecules to neutralize the phosphates , and in the process modify their ionization potential  @xcite . even for the dry case in vacuum ,",
    "there are few counter - ions or water molecules that may still reside on the phosphates of the backbones even after the drying process and hence can change the effective on - site energy of the backbone sites .",
    "though the main conducting pathway is believed to be the @xmath2 interaction of the stacked base - pairs in double stranded dna and the backbones do not take part directly in the electronic transport process of dna , one can significantly control the transport behavior of dna just by tuning the environment which effectively modifies the backbone on - site energies introducing disorder .",
    "we have shown that this kind of control can ignite a semiconducting to metal transition in the conducting behavior of dna .    in this paper",
    "we study the electronic conduction properties of dna double helix within the tight - binding framework where environmental fluctuations are modelled in terms of disordered on - site potentials of the backbone sites .",
    "we propose a model that explicitly takes into account the helicity of the dna molecule .",
    "we have observed that helicity significantly enhances electronic conduction , and , the interplay of helicity and backbone disorder has nontrivial effects on the transmission characteristics of the dna molecules .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii",
    "we introduce the model hamiltonian and briefly describe our theoretical formulation .",
    "we analyze our numerical results in sec .",
    "iii and finally conclude in sec .",
    "dna , carrier of genetic code of all living organism , is a long and complex biological macro - molecule , a @xmath3-stacked array of base - pairs made from four nucleotides guanine ( g ) , adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) and thymine ( t ) coupled via hydrogen bond and forms a double - helix structure associated with sugar - phosphate backbone attached to each base - pair  @xcite . in most of the theoretical models",
    "it is assumed that electronic transport  @xcite is through the long - axis of the dna molecule . in the present study ,",
    "the helicity of the dna molecule is incorporated in a tight - binding ( tb ) dangling backbone ladder model  @xcite by adding hopping integrals due to the proximity of atoms in the upper strand with the corresponding atoms of the lower strand in the next pitch ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the twisted ladder model can be expressed as    @xmath4    where , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons in the _ i_th wannier state , @xmath8 hopping integral between neighboring nucleotides along each strand of the ladder , @xmath9 on - site potential energy of the nucleotides , @xmath10 hopping amplitude between a nucleotide and the corresponding backbone site , @xmath11 on - site potential energy of the backbone sites with @xmath12 for @xmath13=i and ii respectively denoting upper and lower backbone sites , @xmath14 interstrand hopping integral between two neighboring sites of dna within a given pitch , @xmath15 interstrand hopping integral between neighboring atomic sites in the adjacent pitches which actually accounts for the helical structure of dna . here",
    "@xmath16 is the number of sites in each strand within a given pitch . for simplicity",
    "we set @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of an infinite homogeneous dna chain ( setting @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) modeled by twisted ladder in the absence backbones . using bloch s theorem , the dispersion relations for the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo)(@xmath22 ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo)(@xmath23 ) can be expressed as @xmath24 , which are separated by an energy gap @xmath25 . notice that for fixed @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 explicitly depends on @xmath16 .    ) between neighboring nucleotides within a given pitch and dashed lines represent the interstrand hopping ( @xmath27 ) between neighboring nucleobases of adjacent pitches .",
    "backbones are not shown in the figure.,width=113,height=302 ]    in order to study the transport behavior of dna , we use semi - infinite 1d chains as leads connected cross - wise to the left ( l ) and right ( r ) ends of the dna double helix and the hamiltonian of the entire system is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the tunneling matrix element between dna and the leads .",
    "we use the green s function formalism in order to obtain transmission probability @xmath35 of electron  @xcite through dna .",
    "the single particle retarded green s function operator for the entire system at energy @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "the transmission probability is given by @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath36 being the incident electron energy and the trace is over the reduced hilbert space spanned by the dna molecule .",

    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are the retarded and advanced self - energies of the left(right ) lead due to its coupling with the dna molecule .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath46 .    restricting ourselves within the linear response regime , at absolute zero temperature",
    ", the conductance @xmath47 is given by the two - terminal landauer formula @xmath48 and the current for an applied bias voltage @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 @xmath51 being the fermi energy .",
    "here we have assumed that there is no charge accumulation within the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the voltage drop occurs only at the boundaries of the conductor .",
    "we first study the localization properties of the system .",
    "the localization length @xmath52 of the system is calculated from the lyapunov exponent  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 = length of the system in terms of basepairs , and @xmath55 denotes average over different disorder configurations . in actual experimental situations",
    "there are various environmental fluctuations .",
    "we have simulated these environmental fluctuations in the model by considering the backbone site energy @xmath56 to be randomly distributed within the range [ @xmath57-w/2 , @xmath57+w/2 ] , where @xmath57 is the average backbone site energy and w represents the disorder strength . for the purpose of numerical investigation the on - site energies of the nucleotides",
    "are taken as the ionization potentials , and the following numerical values are used through out this work : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the intrastrand hopping integrals between like nucleotides are taken as @xmath62 while those between unlike nucleotides are taken as @xmath63 .",
    "we take interstrand hopping parameter to be @xmath64 . as all the nucleobases",
    "are connected with sugar - phosphate backbone by identical c - n bonds , the corresponding hopping parameter between the nucleobase and backbone is taken to be equal for all the cases and we take @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "the parameters used here are the same as those used in  @xcite which were extracted from the _ ab initio _ calculations  @xcite .    [",

    "case the response is almost linear which indicates that the system would undergo a transition from semiconducting to metallic phase depending on on - site energies of the backbone , not only disorder can induce that kind of transition  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 characteristics for @xmath70 case are in good agreement with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "we have checked the @xmath0 response for different system sizes , and observed that there is no significant change in the characteristics . in fig.[fig7 ] we show the @xmath0 responses for the two periodic sequences for @xmath71 case in presence of the backbone disorder .",
    "it clearly shows that with increasing disorder the current in the system decreases .",
    "within the tight - binding framework , the fishbone and the dangling backbone ladder models are generally used to study the transport properties of dna like systems , but none of these models have incorporated the effect of helicity of dna molecules .",
    "helicity is a very fundamental aspect of the dna structure and gives the possibility of new conduction channels in dna . in this paper",
    "we propose a model that accounts for the helical structure of the dna molecules and show that there is a significant change in the localization properties and @xmath0 response of the systems .",
    "one of the main results is that there exists a almost disorder independent critical hopping ( @xmath72 ) for which localization length becomes maximum for each of the sequences that we have considered . at this critical hopping strength system",
    "is least affected by the external disturbances , _",
    "i.e. _ , environmental effects are least at this point .",
    "if one can utilize this information properly then it might be possible to minimize the environmental effects in the actual experiments .",
    "we have also shown that though backbones do not play any role directly in electron conduction but they can significantly contribute by narrowing the energy gap and reducing the cut - off voltage .",
    "it might also be possible to find dna in a complete metallic phase even in presence of environmental fluctuations as evident from the almost linear @xmath0 response of poly(dg)-poly(dc ) sequence for @xmath71 .",
    "we look forward that there might be experimental investigations as well as _",
    "ab initio _ calculations in near future to find the exact value of the interstrand hopping integral ( @xmath27 ) between nucleobases of adjacent pitches and its actual role in transport ."
