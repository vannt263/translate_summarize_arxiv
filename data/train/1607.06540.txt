    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) has emerged as one of the disruptive technologies for future fifth generation cellular networks , due to its potential benefits such as improvement of several orders of magnitude in spectral and energy efficiencies @xcite . the key idea behind massive mimo is to deploy a very large number of antennas at the base station ( bs ) to serve many tens of users simultaneously .",
    "with such a deployment , massive mimo reaps almost all the advantages offered by conventional mimo , but on a much larger scale @xcite . a substantial implementation burden incurred by deploying hundreds of antennas is the channel estimation for a large number of channels . in order to ease this burden , the time division duplex",
    "( tdd ) mode is adopted in massive mimo networks such that the channels between the bs and the users are estimated via the uplink @xcite . due to the assumption of channel reciprocity in the tdd mode",
    ", the estimated channel knowledge can be directly utilized for the downlink transmission @xcite .",
    "pilot contamination is a practical problem that any massive mimo network designer can face , which occurs when non - orthogonal pilot sequences are used across the whole network . in massive mimo networks ,",
    "the number of users is in general larger than the number of available pilot sequences .",
    "this indicates that the same pilot sequence needs to be assigned to two or more users , resulting in pilot contamination .",
    "therefore , pilot contamination is identified as one of the main performance limiting factors in massive mimo @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed to address the pilot contamination problem in massive mimo networks , such as protocol based methods @xcite , precoding based methods @xcite , angle - of - arrival based methods @xcite , and blind methods @xcite .",
    "while the aforementioned studies stand on their own merits , very little attention has been paid to the pilot sequence design , which decreases the negative effect of pilot contamination on the network performance .",
    "one example is @xcite , which designed pilot sequences and power allocation scheme for a single - cell massive mimo network . for a multi - cell massive mimo network , unfortunately , the design of load - achieving pilot sequences has not been explored in the literature . despite its practical significance ,",
    "such design is not trivial as multiple cells impose additional constraints that need to be satisfied , e.g. , the per - cell quality of service requirements of users .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel pilot sequence design for an @xmath0-cell massive mimo network .",
    "in each cell , an @xmath1-antenna bs communicates with @xmath2 single - antenna users in the tdd mode . in our design ,",
    "the pilot sequences are generated for all the users in the network as per the rules of the generalized welch bound equality ( gwbe ) sequence design @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind choosing gwbe lies in its ability of achieving user capacity @xcite in code - division - multiple - access ( cdma ) systems @xcite .",
    "notably , the gwbe design for a single cell cdma system can not be directly utilized in multi - cell massive mimo networks . moreover",
    ", our design guarantees low correlation between different pilot sequences and thus reduces the detrimental impact of pilot contamination . the primary contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .   we derive a new expression for the user load of the multi - cell massive mimo network .",
    "the user load is defined as the number of users that can be simultaneously served , with their signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) requirements being satisfied .",
    "we then determine the load region of the network , under which the newly derived user load is achieved .",
    "we propose an easy - to - implement algorithm which produces load - achieving pilot sequences satisfying the sinr requirements at all the users within the network .",
    "based on the algorithm , we also determine the power allocation for the downlink data transmission .",
    "3 .   we present numerical results to provide useful insights into the advantages of our proposed gwbe design over the existing pilot sequence designs .",
    "we show that our design achieves a larger load region and supports a greater range of sinr requirement than the existing designs .",
    "we further show that our design satisfies the sinr requirement with finite @xmath1 , due to the larger load region it achieves , while the existing designs do not , even with infinite @xmath1 .",
    "in this work we consider an @xmath0-cell tdd massive mimo network . in each cell ,",
    "an @xmath1-antenna bs communicates with @xmath2 single - antenna users .",
    "we denote @xmath3 as the total number of users in the network , where @xmath4 . in this network",
    "we consider both large - scale and small - scale propagation effects .",
    "specifically , we denote @xmath5 as the propagation factor between the @xmath6th user in the @xmath7th cell and the @xmath8th bs antenna in the @xmath9th cell , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath14 characterizes the large - scale path loss effect from the @xmath6th user in the @xmath7th cell to the bs in the @xmath9th cell and @xmath15 characterizes the small - scale multipath fading effect from the @xmath6th user in the @xmath7th cell to the @xmath8th bs antenna in the @xmath9th cell . in particular , we assume that @xmath15 follows an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) rayleigh fading model , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "we also assume a block fading channel model , where the channel remains constant during the coherence time interval of @xmath17 but changes independently every interval .",
    "we further assume channel reciprocity between the uplink and the downlink , which is typical in tdd systems @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "the propagation factor estimated via the uplink can be utilized for the downlink transmission .",
    "we first focus on the channel estimation process in the uplink . in this process",
    ", the propagation factors in each cell are estimated by the bs using the pilot sequences sent by @xmath2 same - cell users .",
    "all pilot sequences are assumed to have unit energy and the length of @xmath18 .",
    "we assume perfect synchronization between the uplink pilot sequences , which is regarded as the worst case scenario for pilot contamination @xcite .",
    "noticeably , synchronization errors result in decoration between the pilot sequences .",

    "we assume that the least square ( ls ) channel estimation method is adopted .",
    "it has been demonstrated that mean square error of an ls channel estimator remains nearly constant as @xmath1 increases @xcite , which makes it attractive for massive mimo networks .",
    "accordingly , the uplink channel from the @xmath36th user in the @xmath9th cell to the bs in the @xmath9th cell is obtained by utilizing the property of the pilot sequence matrix , given by @xmath37 . based on and assuming that the uplink power control is enabled with @xmath38",
    ", we obtain the ls channel estimate as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the transpose of @xmath41 , @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the correlation coefficient between pilot sequences , defined as @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath44 varies from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 indicate a perfect positive correlation and a perfect negative correlation between pilot sequences , respectively , while 0 indicates no correlation ( or equivalently , orthogonal pilot sequences ) .",
    "it is evident from that the use of non - orthogonal pilot sequences for different users in the network , i.e. , @xmath49 , contaminates the uplink channel estimate .",
    "this effect is referred to as pilot contamination , which significantly deteriorates the performance of massive mimo networks .",
    "we now concentrate on the downlink data transmission . in this transmission , a data symbol @xmath50",
    "is sent to the @xmath36th user in the @xmath9th cell from the same - cell bs .",

    "we assume that the data symbols are uncorrelated zero mean symbols and linearly precoded by a precoding vector @xmath53 .",

    "the user load is defined as the number of users that can be simultaneously served via the downlink in the massive mimo network such that sinr requirements of all the users are satisfied . here ,",
    "we preserve a practical assumption that the number of users in each cell is higher than the length of the pilot sequence , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the massive mimo bs typically serves a huge number of users using a limited number of pilot sequences . under this assumption ,",
    "the network performance suffers from both inter - cell pilot contamination and intra - cell pilot contamination , which is treated as a worst - case scenario for a pilot contaminated massive mimo network .",
