    "when modeling nonlinear problems , dissipative algorithms have provided researchers with an extremely valuable tool since usually most non dissipative schemes fail to produce a stable evolution .",
    "more precisely , when using neutrally stable algorithms , instabilities often arise which spoil the evolution .",
    "the addition of artificial dissipation removes these instabilities by `` damping '' the growing modes of the solution , in a somewhat controlled way .",
    "therefore , its inclusion in a discretization scheme provides a practical and economic way of achieving longer evolutions .",
    "the most widely used algorithms with this property are the family of lax schemes  @xcite ; whereby adding to the equation @xmath0 a term proportional to @xmath1 one obtains a stable discretization of the system that would otherwise be unstable .",
    "however , one might correctly ask whether this is not tantamount to solving a completely different problem .",
    "the beauty of these methods is that the proportionality factor depends on the discretization size , and in the continuous limit the approximation to modified pde results in a consistent approximation to the original one .",
    "although there is much experience with these kind of schemes , most of the standard dissipative algorithms have been tailored for cauchy initial value problems , where initial data is provided at one instant of time and evolved to the next instant by means of the evolution equation . however , in radiative problems , it is sometimes more convenient to choose a sequence of hypersurfaces adapted to the propagation of the waves , and therefore one adopts a foliation adapted to the characteristics of the pde under study .    in the present work , we present a new algorithm adequate for hyperbolic systems .",
    "the underlying strategy of the proposed algorithm is quite different from the conventional cauchy - type methods .",
    "rather , it is inspired by analytic concepts developed in the 1960s  @xcite for studies of gravitational radiation in general relativity and in their subsequent numerical integrations .",
    "the main features of this approach are the use of characteristic surfaces ( for the foliation of the spacetime ) and compactification methods ( that enable the inclusion of infinity in the numerical grid ) to describe radiation properties .",
    "although evolution algorithms ( for systems possessing some kind of symmetry ) developed within this approach proved to be successful in the linear and mildly nonlinear regime  @xcite , they produce unstable evolutions when applied to the general case ; which shows the need for devising algorithms that could be applied in this situation . in the present work we present a new algorithm having dissipative properties , making it a valuable tool to study systems where strong fields might be present .    in section @xmath2 the details of the algorithm for the wave equation",
    "are presented and its stability properties discussed .",
    "section 3 is devoted to treat a model problem which shows how the dissipative algorithm might be a useful tool for numerical investigations in general relativity .",
    "finally , in section @xmath3 we describe two particular applications of this algorithm in the numerical implementation of general relativity .",
    "waves of amplitude @xmath4 traveling in one spatial direction with unit speed obey the familiar equation @xmath5 which can be solved in the region @xmath6 , assuming @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given .",
    "if , instead , one is interested in the solving the problem restricted to the region @xmath9 , boundary data must also be provided corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "the analysis of this problem can be described in a simple way in terms of the characteristics of this equation , which are given by @xmath11 through each spatial point @xmath12 .    in particular , when solving eq .",
    "@xmath13 in the region @xmath14 .",
    "the domain of dependence @xmath15 of a point @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 naturally defined by the characteristics passing through @xmath16 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the region to the future of    * the line @xmath21 , + * the region defined by @xmath22 or @xmath23 $ ] ( where @xmath24 ) ; in these cases , boundary conditions must be imposed at @xmath25 ( and @xmath26 in the latter case ) .",
    "suppose one introduces a coordinate system adapted to the characteristics by , say @xmath27 ; then , eq . ( [ weqcar ] ) reduces to @xmath28 further , one can then choose to foliate the spacetime by a sequence of characteristics obtained by holding the ( retarded ) time @xmath29 .",
    "one can then define a _",
    "characteristic initial value problem _",
    ", where eq .",
    "( [ weqnul ] ) is solved provided that @xmath30 is given .",
    "( note that @xmath31 need not be provided as in the cauchy initial value problem ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that a solution of eq .",
    "( [ weqnul ] ) is expressible as @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are smooth functions ) .",
    "physically , @xmath35 describes waves propagating in the @xmath36 direction ( outgoing waves ) and @xmath37 describes waves propagating in the @xmath38 direction ( incoming waves ) .",
    "then , if one imposes the condition of pure outgoing waves , the solution must be of the form @xmath39 ; hence , along each characteristic the value of the function is constant .",
    "notably , boundary data at @xmath40 can be given arbitrarily since purely outgoing waves at @xmath41 will not reach @xmath40 .",
    "more generally , boundary data consistent with the incoming waves must be prescribed at @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to note the domain of dependence for this problem . when solving eq .",
    "( [ weqnul ] ) in the region @xmath42 , the domain of dependence @xmath43 of a point @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 however , if the region @xmath42 is chosen to be the future of the line @xmath47 , @xmath48 extends indefinitely to the past .",
    "therefore , the characteristic approach requires @xmath42 to have a boundary .",
    "thus , one defines @xmath42 as the region @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig : domdep ] ) illustrates the domains of dependence corresponding to each formulation .    for hyperbolic systems with two or more spatial dimensions ,",
    "the manner in which the characteristics determine the domain of dependence and lead to evolution equations is qualitatively the same .",
    "also , the use of coordinates adapted to them provide a tidy way for studying the system .",
    "for instance , in @xmath51 dimensions , the wave equation is given by @xmath52 which , in term of spherical polar coordinates @xmath53 has the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the angular momentum operator @xmath56 introducing coordinates @xmath57 , which defines a natural inner boundary at @xmath40 , eq .",
    "( [ wav3d ] ) takes the form @xmath58 thus , by defining @xmath59 and considering @xmath60 as a source term , eq .",
    "( [ 3d1d ] ) formally looks like the @xmath61 dimensional system .",
    "therefore , from now on we restrict our analysis to this latter case and extend our results to the @xmath51 dimensional case in section @xmath3 .",
    "the formal integration of ( [ weqnul ] ) proceeds by an integration in the @xmath62 direction on each @xmath29 surface and then evolve to the next level .",
    "this reformulates the integration in the characteristic formulation as an `` evolution '' in the radial direction and then another in the @xmath63 direction ( as opposed to the evolution of a `` whole '' instant of time to the next one typical of the cauchy evolution ) .",
    "hence , standard dissipative schemes intended for cauchy - type evolutions ( like the family of lax algorithms ) are not directly applicable in the characteristic formulation of the pde and the addition of artificial viscosity to the system must be reformulated .    in the numerical implementation of eq .",
    "( [ weqnul ] ) a useful discretization was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this scheme is basically a second order approximation based on finite difference techniques . assuming the grid discretization is given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the derivatives may be discretized in the following way : @xmath66 the resulting scheme ( which we will refer to as giw ) is a second order in time , second order in space accurate algorithm .",
    "notably , the von neuman analysis shows that the giw scheme has unitary amplification factor ( i.e. a neutrally stable algorithm ) independent of the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this would imply that the algorithm is unconditionally stable which is at first sight puzzling .",
    "this might be explained by the implicit local structure of the algorithm ( since it involves @xmath51 points at the upper time level ) and , as such , a local stability analysis need not give a condition on the discretization size .",
    "nevertheless , the algorithm is globally explicit as the evolution proceeds by an outward march from the origin .",
    "hence , the algorithm does require the enforcement of the cfl condition to ensure that the numerical and analytical domains of dependence are consistent",
    ".    the cfl condition for the system can be easily obtained .",
    "the field at grid point at @xmath69 , depends critically on the field value at @xmath70 ( since all the points where @xmath71 are trivially included in the discretization ) .",
    "the requirement for the numerical domain of dependence to include the analytical domain of dependence is @xmath72 ; therefore , the cfl condition will be satisfied if @xmath73 .",
    "the giw algorithm has been employed successfully in the characteristic formulation of general relativity ( g.r . ) assuming either spherical symmetry  @xcite ; axisymmetry  @xcite or very small departures from spherical symmetry  @xcite . however , when considering more general problems , as it is often the case with neutrally stable schemes , round off error or parasitic modes are enough to cause ripples in the solution which often lead to an unstable evolution . as stated earlier",
    ", adding dissipation to the pde constitutes a way to alleviate this problem  @xcite .",
    "we now show that a rather simple modification of ( [ weqnul ] ) can be used to obtain a consistent discretization with dissipative properties .",
    "we start by considering the following equation @xmath74 ( the @xmath75 factor is included for convenience ) .",
    "a straightforward discretization of ( [ neweqn ] ) is obtained by the described approximation for @xmath76 ( [ gur ] ) and @xmath77 ( [ grr ] ) and by approximating the third derivative at the point @xmath78 as @xmath79    in analogy to the lax method , the inclusion of this extra term leads to a consistent difference approximation of eq .",
    "( [ weqnul ] ) ; that is , the difference approximation converges formally to the differential equation in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to check that the resulting approximation is accurate of order @xmath81 .",
    "an important feature of the resulting algorithm ( which we shall call da ) is its dissipative features , which make it particularly useful .",
    "the stability properties of this algorithm can be easily obtained by introducing fourier modes such that @xmath82 . after some algebra one obtains @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the equation governing the growth of the solution s modes is @xmath86 now , since @xmath87 ( for @xmath88 ) the scheme will be stable if , @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , @xmath90 as @xmath91 , indicating that the high frequency modes are effectively `` damped '' , while @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",
    "the obtained discretization can also be thought of as an approximation to the original equation ( [ weqnul ] ) ( i.e. without the addition of the extra term ) where the finite differencing of @xmath76 includes @xmath3 points on the _ nth _ level as @xmath94 which can be regarded as a weighted average of the derivatives at @xmath78 obtained from field values at the points @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate how this algorithm produces a stable discretization when the original strategy ( corresponding to @xmath97 ) fails .",
    "in this section we study the stability properties of an equation bearing close resemblance to the nonlinear evolution equation encountered in the characteristic formulation of general relativity ( which will presented in the section iv ) @xmath98 in order to keep track of the nonlinearity of the equation , we introduce the parameter @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 ) , such that @xmath101 ; hence , eq .  ( [ eq : biggnon ] ) becomes @xmath102    in particular , note that the principal part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : biggnongral ] ) corresponds to the wave equation .",
    "also , it reduces in the the linear case ( @xmath103 ) , to the wave equation . consequently ; one might expect the giw discretization to lead a stable scheme .",
    "however this is not the case , as can be demonstrated by the following analysis .",
    "first , in order to simplify the study of the stability of this nonlinear problem , we _ linearize the pde with respect to the previous time step_@xcite to obtain a more manageable equation . in this linearization , we approximate the values of @xmath4 and @xmath104 with respect to the _ nth _ level , but @xmath105 is centered in between the levels .",
    "the resulting finite difference approximation is @xmath106 finally , we introduce the fourier modes @xmath107 and solve for @xmath108 , obtaining @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 it is not difficult to check that @xmath113 is a positive quantity for @xmath114 ( which will be the case if the cfl condition is satisfied ) .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath115 is always larger than @xmath61 , indicating that this discretization is _ unconditionally unstable ! _ it is remarkable that the simple addition of some nonlinear terms , even when they do not change the equation s principal part , completely break an algorithm that would otherwise be stable .",
    "we now modify the way @xmath76 is discretized by introducing dissipation as dictated by the d.a .",
    "scheme , i.e. @xmath116 with this simple modification , the value of @xmath108 now becomes @xmath117 since @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the condition for stability is that @xmath120 . given @xmath121 , this a condition on @xmath122 , or vice versa .",
    "for instance , if @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the discretization will be stable if @xmath125 . on the other hand , if we choose @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 will be satisfied if @xmath129 .",
    "figure  [ vareps ] shows the value of @xmath115 for different choices of @xmath122 for a given @xmath99 ; the effect of the added dissipation can be clearly seen .",
    "when solving einstein equations , one can take advantage of the coordinate invariance of the theory to simplify the modeling of a specific problem .",
    "in particular , one is free to choose a foliation of the spacetime better suited to the problem .    in the numerical implementation of g.r . , the most common approach is to choose a foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces at constant times . in this approach ,",
    "einstein equations form a second oder pde system for the _ intrinsic geometry _ of each surface and its embedding in the spacetime , the _ extrinsic curvature_. einstein equations are split into two distinct set of equations .",
    "one set consists of _ constraint _ equations that limit the possible configurations of the field variables on each hypersurface .",
    "the second set constitutes the _ evolution _ equations that determine the development of the field variables onto the next hypersurface .",
    "the main drawback of the numerical implementation of the cauchy formulation is the impossibility of having an infinite grid to completely cover the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "thus , in practice , one chooses an exterior boundary in order to deal with a finite domain .",
    "this introduces further problems since special conditions on the boundary must be imposed in order to avoid reflections which spoil long term evolutions .",
    "although in the @xmath61 dimensional case there are sound method to achieve this ( e.g. the sommerfeld condition ) , in the general case , any local boundary condition still introduces reflections turning the task of obtaining long accurate evolutions into an almost impossible one .",
    "a related problem arising from an outer boundary at a finite distance is that the radiation can not be rigorously calculated .",
    "when studying gravitational radiation a more natural choice adapted to the wave propagation is to adopt a sequence of characteristic hypersurfaces to cover the spacetime .",
    "this approach is known as the _ characteristic formulation of g.r .",
    "_ , pioneered by bondi and sachs  @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients of this formulation are the foliation of the spacetime by a sequence of characteristic hypersurfaces and the use of compactification techniques ( which enable the inclusion of infinity in a finite grid ) to rigorously describe asymptotic properties of radiation  @xcite .",
    "the equations naturally split into _",
    "hypersurface equations _ and _ evolution equations_. we now outline the main aspects of the numerical implementation of this formulation ( based on  @xcite ; where a detailed description of the problem has been presented ) and employ the constructed algorithm to discretize the pde equations governing the evolution of the fields .",
    "a coordinate system is introduced by labeling the outgoing lightlike hypersurfaces with a parameter @xmath63 ; ach null ray on a specific hypersurface labeled with @xmath130 @xmath131 and choose @xmath62 as a surface area coordinate ( i.e. surfaces at @xmath132 have area @xmath133 ) . in",

    "<S> we present a dissipative algorithm for solving nonlinear wave - like equations when the initial data is specified on characteristic surfaces . the dissipative properties built in this algorithm make it particularly useful when studying the highly nonlinear regime where previous methods have failed to give a stable evolution in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm presented in this work is directly applicable to hyperbolic systems proper of electromagnetism , yang - mills and general relativity theories . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out an analysis of the stability of the algorithm and test its properties with linear waves propagating on a minkowski background and the scattering off a scwharszchild black hole in general relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> key words : derivation of finite difference approximations ; stability and convergence of difference methods ; electromagnetism , other . </S>",
