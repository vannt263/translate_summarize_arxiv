    "at rhic energies @xmath1 agev ) a new observable was predicted in nuclear collisions : jet quenching  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "collisional energy loss of a hard jet propagating through quark - gluon plasma has been estimated to be modest  @xcite : @xmath2 gev / fm , however the induced radiative energy loss estimated  @xcite from the gunion - bertsch amplitude  @xcite is expected to be significantly larger , @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model for non - abelian energy loss was developed and the analog of the qed class of radiation diagrams was summed .",
    "this leads to a constant @xmath4 gev / fm independent of the path length .",
    "however , in bdmps  @xcite it was shown that gluon rescattering diagrams in the medium considerably increased the energy loss . for an incident very high energy jet penetrating a plasma of thickness , @xmath5 , in which the mean free path , @xmath6 , and the color electric fields are screened on a scale @xmath7 , the analytic bdmps prediction @xcite is @xmath8 .",
    "an alternative path integral approach led to similar results  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of the energy loss in qed was calculated recently @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the analytic approximations are not applicable to `` thin '' plasmas of only a few mean free path thickness , and more importantly they do not apply at all to the problem of computing the angular distribution .",
    "the main complication is that the angular distributions require a complete treatment of all gluon and jet final state interactions . in a direct brute force",
    "pqcd approach , in the * thin plasma limit * where the main simplicity arises from the fact that for a few rescatterings , @xmath9 , the number of amplitudes is however still sufficiently small to allow direct computation of all interference terms .",
    "here we display the @xmath0 case , a complete investigation of @xmath9 rescattering can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the single rescattering case , @xmath0 , was first considered by gunion and bertsch  @xcite ( gb ) .",
    "they estimated the hadron rapidity distribution due to gluon bremsstrahlung associated with a single elastic valence quark scattering in the low - nussinov model .",
    "the most important difference compared to the problem addressed in this paper is that gb computed the non - abelian analog of the bethe - heitler formula while we are interested in the analog of radiative energy loss in sudden processes analogous to @xmath10-decay .",
    "the gb problem therefore is to compute the soft radiation associated with a single scattering of an incident on - shell quark prepared in the remote past , i.e. , @xmath11 , relative to the collision time , @xmath12 . in our case ,",
    "the radiation associated with a hard jet processes in nuclear reactions must take into account the fact that the jet parton rescatters within a short time , @xmath13 , after it is produced .",
    "the sudden appearance of the jet color dipole moment within a time interval @xmath14 results in a broad angular distribution of gluons even with no final state scattering .",
    "the induced radiation cased by rescattering necessarily interferes strongly with this hard radiation .    to model the scattering in a thin plasma",
    ", we employ the same model of the plasma as considered in gyulassy ",
    "wang ( gw ) @xcite . the scattering centers are approximated by static color - screened potentials with fourier components @xmath15 and color screening mass , @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude for the production of a hard jet with momentum @xmath17 localized initially near @xmath18 we denote by @xmath19 .",
    "the hard vertex is localized within a distance @xmath20 , and the amplitude , @xmath21 , is assumed to vary slowly with @xmath22 on the infrared screening scale @xmath7 .",
    "this jet radiates a gluon with momentum @xmath23 , which can scatter on @xmath0 scattering center .",
    "the conditional double inclusive jet and gluon probability distribution is the following : @xmath26 which involves averaging over all initial target colors and summing over all final colors and the locations @xmath27 of the target centers . after averaging",
    "one obtains : @xmath28 & \\times &   { \\displaystyle \\left \\langle \\begin{array}{c }   { { { \\rm tr}}}\\ , \\left (   \\sum\\limits_{i , j=1}^3 { \\cal m}_{1,i } ( k , p;{{\\vec q}}_{1 \\perp } ) { \\cal m}_{1,j}^\\dagger ( k , p;{{\\vec q}}_{1 \\perp}^{\\ ; \\prime }   ) \\right )   \\end{array }   \\right \\rangle_t } \\ ; .\\qquad \\label{rho1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the main source of non - diagonal dependence arises through the interference terms in @xmath29 and the @xmath30 transverse form factor .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the three radiative amplitudes m@xmath31 of fig.1 . are given by @xmath32 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{m1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the momentum distribution of gluon radiation can be derived from the conditional probability distribution of radiation @xmath33 , normalized by the elastic scattering @xmath34 @xcite . before averaging on scattering centers",
    "one can obtain from eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) : @xmath35 here we rearranged the radiation amplitudes and introduced the hard term @xmath36 , the cascading term @xmath37 , and the gb term @xmath38 .",
    "the interference terms contain phase factors composed from transverse energy transfer terms @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and time difference term @xmath42 .",
    "these interference terms are responsible for `` quantum cascading '' : without them one can recover the classical cascading limit in eq .",
    "( [ dn10 ] ) ; with them a complex behavior of `` quantum cascading '' dominated by these interference terms appears .",
    "the transverse form factor @xmath43 connects to the target size and it regulates automatically the gluon cascading on the finite size target object .    in the limit @xmath44 the hard radiation formula for the no - scattering case , @xmath45 is recovered .",
    "the limit @xmath46 is corresponding to the isolated bremsstrahlung amplitude and it leads to the characteristic gb radiation spectrum , @xmath47 @xcite .    at finite @xmath12 and",

    "( [ rho1 ] ) leads to the angular distribution of the radiated gluon .",
    "2 . displays our numerical results , normalizing the one gluon radiation one scattering distribution , @xmath49 , by the one gluon radiation no scattering distribution , @xmath50 .",
    "fig.2a , displays the contribution of the time - independent , classical cascading terms and their sum .",
    "fig.2b , shows the strong influence of the interference terms . especially at small @xmath51 the hard radiation limit is recovered through the suppression of the gb contribution .",
    "this can be proved exactly in eq.([dn10 ] ) by means of @xmath52 . at large @xmath51 kinematical cuts",
    "appear from the appropriate jet energy , however the enhancement connecting the presence of the @xmath53 cascading term can be seen clearly .    in the case of more scattering ( @xmath54 )",
    "the existence of @xmath55 cascading terms leads to approximate exponentiation of the relative gluon radiation distribution .",
    "naive interpretation of this result would suggest that the energy loss exponentiates with the length .",
    "however , in that case multiple emission processes have to be also considered and this necessitates a renormalization of the wavefunction as discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite . with that renormalization",
    "one finds approximately constant @xmath56 for @xmath57 up to l @xmath58 3 fm .",
    "( a ) the normalized time - independent envelopes and separate contributions to the conditional probability distribution of gluons associated with a single rescattering @xmath0 of quark jet ( @xmath59 ) is shown as a function of the logarithmic `` angle '' , @xmath60 with @xmath61 gev .",
    "these curves correspond to the incoherent parton cascade limit .",
    "( b ) for finite @xmath62 fm / c case destructive interference limits the corrections to the hard self - quench distribution to higher angles as shown for different gluon energies .",
