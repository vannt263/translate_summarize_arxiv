    "although the idea that a sheet of paper can be folded along an arbitrary curve is unfamiliar to many , performing this activity has been a form of art for quite some time .",
    "bauhaus , the extinct german school of art and design , was a pioneer in developing the concept of curved folding structures by the end of the 1920s @xcite . this practice often yields severely buckled and mechanically stiff sculptures featuring interesting structural properties and reveals new ways to think about engineering and architecture @xcite .",
    "traditional origami has had a strong influence in the solution of many practical problems , to cite a few , the deployment of large membranes in space @xcite and biomedical applications @xcite . however , exploring this long established art form still has a lot of potential . since the work by huffman in 1976 @xcite , an elegant and groundbreaking description of the geometry of curved creases , more attention has been devoted to this subject @xcite .",
    "a mechanical approach of structures comprising curved creases has recently been proposed  @xcite motivated by the intriguing 3d shapes shown in figure  [ fig : rodsection ] . in the present paper , we build upon this recent work by further exploring the mechanical models governing folded structures .",
    "folded structures combine geometry and mechanics : they deform in an inextensible manner and their mechanics is constrained by the geometry of developable surfaces  @xcite . here",
    ", we consider one of the simplest folded structures : a narrow elastic plate comprising a central fold , as shown in figure  [ fig : rodsection ] .",
    "the role of geometry is apparent from the following observations , which anyone can reproduce with a paper model : the curvature of the crease line is minimum when the fold is flattened , a closed crease pattern results into a fold that buckles out of plane , while an open crease pattern results in a planar fold . these and other geometrical facts have been proved by fuchs and tabachnikov  @xcite .",
    "the mechanics of thin rods has a long history  @xcite , and is used to tackle a number of problems from different fields today , such as the morphogenesis of slender objects  @xcite , the equilibrium shape of elongated biological filaments  such as dna  @xcite and bacterial flagellum  @xcite  and the mechanics of the human hair  @xcite .",
    "the classical theory of rods , known as kirchhoff s rod theory , assumes that all dimensions of the cross - section are comparable : the consequence is that the cross - sections of the rod deform almost rigidly as long as long as the strain remains small .",
    "this assumption does not apply to a folded strip : its cross - sections are slender , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : rodsection](a ) , and , as a result , they can bend by a large amount .",
    "in addition , the dihedral angle at the ridge can also vary by a large amount .",
    "vlasov s theory for thin - walled beams overcomes the limitations of kirchhoff s theory by relaxing some kinematic constraints and considering additional modes of deformations of the cross - section .",
    "this kinematic enrichment can be justified from 3d elasticity : assuming a thin - walled geometry , asymptotic convergence of the 3d problem to a rod model of vlasov type has been established formally  @xcite .",
    "this justification from 3d elasticity requires that the deformations are mild , however : the cross - sections can only bend by a small amount away from their natural shape .",
    "mechanical models have been proposed to capture the large deformations of thin - walled beams .",
    "the special case of curved cross - sections must be addressed starting from the theory of shell : in this case , the bending of the centerline involves a trade - off between the shell s bending and stretching energies  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the strip that we consider is developable ; it can be studied based on an inextensible plate model , in which the stretching energy plays no role .",
    "a model for a thin elastic strip has been developed sadowsky  @xcite in the case of a narrow ribbon , and later extended by wunderlich to a finite width  @xcite .",
    "these strip models have found numerous applications recently , see  @xcite for instance .",
    "they have been developed independently of the theory of rods , as they make use of unknowns that are tied to the developability constraint .    here",
    ", we develop a unified view of strips and rods .",
    "we promote the viewpoint that elastic strips are just a special case of thin rods .",
    "the equations for the equilibrium of a narrow , inextensible plate are shown to be equivalent to those for an inextensible rod . to establish this equivalence",
    ", we identify the relevant geometrical constraints and derive of an effective , non - linear constitutive law . by doing so ,",
    "we extend vlasov s models for thin - walled beams to large deformations .",
    "a unified perspective of strips and rods brings in the following benefits : instead of re - deriving the equations of equilibrium for strips from scratch , which is cumbersome , we show that the classical kirchhoff equations are applicable ; we identify for the first time the stress variables relevant to the strip model , which is crucial for stability problems ; the extension of the strip model to handle natural ( geodesic ) curvature , or the presence of a central fold becomes straightforward , as we demonstrate ; stability analyses and numerical solutions of post - buckled equilibria can be carried out in close analogy with what is routinely done for classical rods .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : singlestrip ] , we start by the smooth case , _ i.e. _  consider an elastic strip without a fold , and derive an equivalent rod model for it . in section  [ sec : bistrip ] , we extend this model to a folded strip , which we call a bistrip ; this is one of the main results of our paper . in section  [ sec : circular ] , we derive circular solutions for the bistrip .",
    "their stability is analyzed in section  [ sec : linearstability ] , and we identify two families of buckling modes : one family of modes explains the typical non - planar shapes of the closed bistrip reported earlier , while the second mode of buckling is novel .",
    "the predictions of the linear stability analysis are confronted to experiments in section  [ sec : experiments ] , and to simulations of the post - buckled solutions in section  [ sec : auto ] .",
    "we start by considering the case of a narrow strip having no central fold and show how it can be described using the language of thin elastic rods .",
    "the model we derive extends the model of sadowsky  @xcite to account for the geodesic curvature of the strip and bridges the gap between his formulation and the classical theory of elastic rods .",
    "we consider an inextensible elastic plate of thickness @xmath0 and width @xmath1 with a large aspect - ratio , @xmath2 . in its undeformed configuration , the strip is planar . under the action of a mechanical load ,",
    "it is deformed into a 3d shape , as sketched in figure  [ fig : singlestrip ] .    .",
    "( b ) the underlying mechanical model is an inextensible plate : in the deformed configuration , the generatrices , shown by the dashed lines , can make an arbitrary angle with the tangent @xmath3 to the centerline . as a result",
    ", the cross - section ( thin solid lines ) can be significantly curved .",
    "the inextensibility constraint is used to reconstruct the mid - surface of the plate , based on the centerline shape @xmath4 ( thick curve ) and on the material frame @xmath5 : this allows the strip to be viewed as a thin rod . ]",
    "the deformed strip is parameterized by a space curve @xmath4 , called the _ centerline _ , and by an orthonormal frame @xmath6 , called the _",
    "material frame_. to define the centerline , we pick one of the lateral edges , which is the thick curve in the figure  [ fig : singlestrip ] . the name ` centerline ' is used for consistency with the theory of rods even though this curve is off the center of the strip .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 be the arc - length along this edge , and by @xmath4 the position in space of the centerline . the derivation with respect to arc - length",
    "is denoted by a prime . by definition ,",
    "the tangent @xmath8 is a unit vector .",
    "since the plate is inextensible , the arc - length @xmath7 will be used as a lagrangian variable .",
    "the direct orthonormal frame @xmath5 , with @xmath9 , is defined in such a way that @xmath3 is the tangent to the centerline , @xmath10 and that @xmath11 and @xmath12 span the tangent plane to the midsurface of the elastic strip at the point @xmath4 .",
    "then , the unit vector @xmath13 is normal to the midsurface at the edge @xmath4 . by construction ,",
    "the material frame is orthonormal and direct : @xmath14 for any indices @xmath15 and for any @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath16 denotes kronecker s symbol , equal to @xmath17 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "the rate of rotation of the material frame with respect to the arc - length is captured by a vector @xmath20 , which we call the darboux vector or the twist - curvature strain .",
    "it is such that , for any @xmath9 , @xmath21 in classical rod theories , the rotation gradient @xmath20 measures the strain associated with the bending and twisting modes . here",
    ", we use a plate model , and the bending strain is measured by the curvature form ( second fundamental form ) of the mid - surface , which we denote by @xmath22 . near a generic point @xmath4 on the centerline",
    ", we use the frame @xmath23 tangent to surface : in this frame , the curvature tensor @xmath24 is represented by a symmetric matrix , @xmath25 from the differential geometry of surfaces  @xcite , the gradient of the unit normal to a surface along any tangent direction can be computed from the second fundamental form . in particular ,",
    "if we consider the gradient of the normal @xmath26 along the tangent @xmath12 to the centerline , we have @xmath27 . identifying with the case @xmath28 equation  ( [ eq : darbouxvectordefinition ] ) , we find that the plate s bending strain and the equivalent rod s curvature strain are related by : @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denote the components of the darboux vector in the material frame .",
    "we use this to express the second fundamental form of the midsurface of the plate , in terms of the darboux vector @xmath32 of the equivalent rod : @xmath33    we assume that the midsurface of the plate is inextensible .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , by gauss theorema egregium  @xcite , its gauss curvature , defined as the determinant of @xmath22 , is zero : @xmath34 second , we note that the quantity @xmath35 , which defines the geodesic curvature of the centerline with respect to the midsurface , is conserved by isometries  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the signed curvature of the edge ( centerline ) in the flat configuration of reference : in the actual configuration , the conservation of the geodesic curvature implies @xmath37    in equation  ( [ eq : kfromomega ] ) , we have expressed the ` microscopic ' strain @xmath22 in terms of the strain @xmath32 of the equivalent rod , and of an additional ` internal ' strain variable @xmath38 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : gausscondition ] ) is a kinematic constraint .",
    "it could be used to eliminate the strain variable @xmath38 in favor of @xmath32 ; we will refrain to do so , however , as this requires the additional assumption @xmath39 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : geodesicconstraint ] ) is a second kinematic constraint applicable to the equivalent rod model .",
    "let us denote by @xmath40 the typical curvature of the plate , @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that the strip is narrow , in the sense that the variations of the curvature tensor on distances comparable to the width @xmath1 remain small compared to @xmath40 : @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we ignore the dependence of the curvature strain on the transverse coordinate : in the entire cross - section containing the centerline point @xmath4 , we approximate the curvature tensor by @xmath24",
    ". this approximation has been used in the past to describe plates with straight centerlines  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to go beyond this approximation  @xcite , as required when the curvature becomes large at localized spots along one of the edges  @xcite  we will refer to this model as a strip of finite width .",
    "an even more general model , applicable to strips of finite width and non - zero geodesic curvature , has been recently derived in  @xcite .",
    "we return to our small width approximation : the bending energy of the inextensible plate @xmath43 can be integrated along the transverse direction , which yields @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bending modulus of the plate , @xmath46 its young s modulus , @xmath47 its poisson s ratio and @xmath0 its thickness . for a @xmath48 matrix ,",
    "the following identity holds : @xmath49 . dropping the determinant using the inextensibility condition  ( [ eq : gausscondition ] )",
    ", one can rewrite the elastic energy as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a rod - type bending modulus , and the double contraction operator is defined by @xmath52 .",
    "note that when @xmath38 is eliminated using the constraint  ( [ eq : gausscondition ] ) , the elastic energy @xmath43 coincides with that derived by sadowsky  @xcite : @xmath53      we derive the equivalent rod model for our thin strip simply by viewing the energy @xmath43 in equation  ( [ eq : bendingenergy3 ] ) as the energy of a thin rod .",
    "the equivalent thin rod has one internal degree of freedom @xmath38 and is subjected to two kinematical constraints @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the [ sec : virtualwork ] , we derive the equations for a rod of this type .",
    "the condition of equilibrium of the internal variable reads    [ eq : constrainedrodsrestate ] @xmath56 and the constitutive law as @xmath57    here , @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the functional derivative of the elastic energy @xmath43 with respect to the local strain @xmath60 and internal variable @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "these equations were obtained by extending equations  ( [ eq : constitutivelawforconstrainedrod - constraint][eq : constitutivelawforconstrainedrod - m ] ) of the appendix to the case of two constraints , and by identifying the internal degree of freedom @xmath62 and the energy @xmath63 .",
    "the two lagrange multipliers @xmath64 and @xmath65 are associated with the two constraint . for convenience",
    ", they have been rescaled with the bending modulus @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _  the quantity @xmath67 in the appendix is replaced with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    equation  ( [ eq : constrainedrodsrestate - k ] ) can be interpreted as the cancellation of the total generalized force acting on the internal variable , which is the sum of the standard force in the first term , and of constraint forces  @xcite in the last two terms .",
    "similarly , the constitutive law in equation  ( [ eq : constrainedrodsrestate - constitutivelaw ] ) is made up of the usual contribution in rod theory , whereby the internal moment is the gradient of the elastic energy with respect to the twist and curvature strains , plus two other terms which are known as ( generalized ) constraint forces .    using the explicit form of the energy @xmath43 and of the constraints @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : constrainedrodsrestate - k ] ) yields @xmath72 this equation will be used to eliminate the internal variable @xmath38 whenever it appears .",
    "in particular , the developability constraint in equation  ( [ eq : gausscondition ] ) takes the form @xmath73    the second equation  ( [ eq : constrainedrodsrestate - constitutivelaw ] ) yields @xmath74 eliminating @xmath38 and projecting onto the material basis , we find the expressions of the twisting and bending moments @xmath75 :    [ eq : constitutivereduced ] @xmath76    this is the constitutive law for a narrow elastic developable strip in the language of rods .",
    "the expression of the constraints in equations  ( [ eq : geodesicconstraint ] ) and  ( [ eq : developabilityconstraint - keliminiated ] ) and the constitutive law  ( [ eq : constitutivereduced ] ) are the main results of of section  [ sec : singlestrip ] .",
    "they translate the inextensible strip model into the language of kirchhoff s rods .",
    "even though the strip is linearly elastic , its constitutive law is effectively non - linear because of the developability constraint .",
    "we emphasize that the cross - sections of the strip are allowed to bend , as sketched in figure  [ fig : singlestrip](b ) : this is required to preserve developabitility when the centerline is both twisted and bent , _",
    "i.e. _ when both @xmath77 and @xmath78 are non - zero .",
    "we found that the strip is _ equivalent _ to an euler - bernoulli rod  for classical rods , the latter model is usually justified by assuming that the cross - sections do not bend but this is just a coincidence .",
    "the strong formulation of the equilibrium of elastic rods is known as the kirchhoff equations  @xcite .",
    "it can be derived by integration by parts from the principle of virtual work , as explained in  [ sec : virtualwork ] :    [ eq : classicalkirchhoffequilibrium ] @xmath79    here , @xmath80 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the inextensibility and euler - bernoulli constraints , which can be interpreted as the internal force . given a distribution of external force @xmath81 and moment @xmath82 , one can find the equilibria of the strip by solving the kinematical equations  ( [ eq : tangent][eq : darbouxvectordefinition ] ) , the contraints  ( [ eq : geodesicconstraint ] ) and  ( [ eq : developabilityconstraint - keliminiated ] ) , the constitutive law  ( [ eq : constitutivereduced ] ) and the equilibrium  ( [ eq : classicalkirchhoffequilibrium ] ) for the unknowns @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath60 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "note that the conserved geodesic curvature @xmath85 is measured along the tangent plane to the flaps , while the curvature strain @xmath92 of the centerline is measured in the plane spanned by @xmath93 and @xmath94 . by equation  ( [ eq : kappag - omegaii - recap ] ) , @xmath95 , and the ratio of these curvatures sets the ridge angle @xmath91 . ]",

    "let us denote by @xmath91 half of the bending angle of the ridge , see the inset of figure  [ fig : fold1](a ) .",
    "this angle can be defined as a signed quantity if we use the orientation provided by the tangent @xmath117 : by convention @xmath91 is positive in the figure . in terms of the parameter @xmath91 , the dihedral angle at the ridge writes @xmath118 .    the local material frames @xmath96 ( @xmath9 and @xmath119 ) can be reconstructed in terms of the bisecting frame and of the angle @xmath91 as follows :    [ eq : rotationbisectingframe ] @xmath120    by this equation , the entire bistrip can be reconstructed in terms of @xmath121 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "the rest of this section is concerned about deriving the constitutive law for the equivalent rod that captures the elasticity of the flaps and of the ridge .      by differentiating equation  ( [ eq : rotationbisectingframe ] ) with respect to arc - length @xmath7 , and identifying the result with equation  ( [ eq : darbouxvectordefinition ] ) defining the local strains",

    "the ridge mode ceases to exist when @xmath143 reaches a numerical value equal to zero within numerical accuracy , which happens slightly beyond the configuration labelled @xmath424 in the figure .",
    "the plot of the ridge angle @xmath209 in figure  [ fig : phasediagram](c ) shows that the branch ends when the ridge angle , which progressively concentrates into two narrow peaks , reaches the value @xmath425 at two opposite points ( asterisks ) .",

    "when the ridge becomes flat , @xmath425 , the bistrip suddenly acquires another degree of freedom , which involves bending both flaps into a cylindrical shape , with generatrices locally perpendicular to the fold line .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the localized mode observed in the experiments , see the asterisks in the experimental picture framed in brown in figure  [ fig : phasediagram](b ) .",
    "therefore , we infer that the ridge branch connects to a branch made of localized solutions in the region @xmath451 , sketched by the brown line in part ( b ) of the figure .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental fact that planar ridge solutions , which are rarely observed as they exist in a narrow interval of @xmath143 , evolve into non - planar localized solutions when the amount of overcurvature is increased .",
    "overall , the post - buckling diagram explains the three types of patterns observed in the experiments .",
    "the localized pattern could not be anticipated by the linear stability analysis as it is produced by a secondary bifurcation : along the ridge branch the dihedral angle @xmath91 progressively concentrates until it reaches zero at two opposite points , allowing the bistrip to become suddenly non - planar .",

    "<S> we consider the equilibrium shapes of a thin , annular strip cut out in an elastic sheet . </S>",
    "<S> when a central fold is formed by creasing beyond the elastic limit , the strip has been observed to buckle out - of - plane . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the theory of elastic plates , we derive a kirchhoff rod model for the folded strip . </S>",
    "<S> a non - linear effective constitutive law incorporating the underlying geometrical constraints is derived , in which the angle the ridge appears as an internal degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast with traditional thin - walled beam models , this constitutive law captures large , non - rigid deformations of the cross - sections , including finite variations of the dihedral angle at the ridge . using this effective rod theory </S>",
    "<S> , we identify a buckling instability that produces the out - of - plane configurations of the folded strip , and show that the strip behaves as an elastic ring having one frozen mode of curvature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we point out two novel buckling patterns : one where the centerline remains planar and the ridge angle is modulated ; another one where the bending deformation is localized . </S>",
    "<S> these patterns are observed experimentally , explained based on stability analyses , and reproduced in simulations of the post - buckled configurations . </S>"
