    "multiferroic materials have been intensively studied in recent years following the discovery of compounds that display giant cross - coupling effects between magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters@xcite .",
    "particular interest has been aroused by the possibility of new magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms@xcite and the potential for exploitation in technological applications@xcite .",
    "one of the most investigated families of multiferroics is the hexagonal manganites @xmath1mno@xmath0 , which form with @xmath2 sc , y , ho , er , tm , yb and lu . the magnetoelectric behavior found in this family is associated with frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions of mn spins on a triangular lattice .",
    "the compounds formed with @xmath2 sc , y and lu are attractive for fundamental studies because they are not complicated by additional magnetic contributions from the @xmath1 ions and because they form a family in which changes in structure and magnetoelectric behavior can be correlated in a systematic way . here",
    "we focus on lumno@xmath0 , and present neutron scattering measurements of the cooperative magnetic dynamics and measurements of the thermal expansion by dilatometry .",
    "the data provide quantitative information on the exchange interactions , magnetic anisotropy , and magnetostriction , all of which play a part in the magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "the results are compared with similar measurements on ymno@xmath0 .",
    "the crystal structure of the hexagonal manganites , which is described by the space group @xmath3 , is built from corner - sharing mno@xmath4 bipyramids which form layers parallel to the @xmath5 plane separated by rare earth ions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "the mn ions form a near - ideal triangular lattice . the ferroelectric distortion , which occurs at a high temperature ( @xmath6k for lumno@xmath0 , ref .  ) , is caused by a tilting of the mno@xmath4 bipyramids and a buckling of the @xmath1 plane , which together create a @xmath7 superlattice distortion ( trimerization ) of the mn ions and a ferroelectric moment along the @xmath8 axis@xcite .",
    "the distortion shifts the mn ions along the @xmath9 axis away from the ideal @xmath10 position@xcite  see fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "the magnetic properties of lumno@xmath0 arise from the ( almost ) triangular layers of mn@xmath11 ( 3@xmath12 ) ions with @xmath13 .",
    "neighboring spins are coupled by antiferromangetic exchange interactions which are frustrated by the triangular geometry , as evidenced by the large ratio of the weiss to nel temperatures @xmath14 ( ref . ) , the anomalous magnetic entropy below @xmath15 @xcite , and the reduction in the value of the ordered magnetic moment to about 75% of the full spin - only moment for @xmath13 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the mn spins in all the hexagonal @xmath1mno@xmath0 compounds form a classical 120@xmath16 structure within the triangular layers ( fig .",
    "[ structure])@xcite .",
    "the spins are confined by anisotropy to lie in the @xmath5 plane , and the large inter - layer separation decouples the layers electronically and makes the magnetism quasi - two - dimensional . in the case of lumno@xmath0 ,",
    "magnetic ordering occurs below @xmath17k .",
    "evidence for magnetoelectric coupling in @xmath1mno@xmath0 compounds is provided by anomalies at @xmath15 in the dielectric constant @xcite , lattice dynamics@xcite , thermal conductivity@xcite and structural parameters@xcite .",
    "there are also interesting observations by optical second - harmonic generation which show a cross - correlation between ferroelectric and magnetic domains due to the formation of magnetic domain walls below @xmath15 which coincide with ferroelectric domain walls@xcite .",
    "the precise microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric coupling in @xmath1mno@xmath0 has not been described yet .",
    "careful structural measurements on y@xmath18lu@xmath19mno@xmath0 have shown that an isostructural transition takes place at @xmath15 ( ref .  ) , which causes further displacements of the ions resulting in a small increase in the ferroelectric polarization .",
    "it was therefore proposed that the magnetoelectric coupling is driven by a primary magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "the origin of the magnetoelastic coupling , however , remains unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the isostructural distortion may occur in order to relieve some energy associated with magnetic frustration@xcite .",
    "another proposal is that the system might benefit energetically from the dzyaloshinskii",
    " moryia interaction below @xmath15 via a small @xmath8-axis displacement in the oxygen atoms that bond adjacent mn atoms@xcite .",
    "this displacement would produce a small additional electric polarization along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "single crystals of lumno@xmath0 were prepared by the optical floating - zone technique as follows .",
    "polycrystalline lumno@xmath0 was prepared by standard solid - state reaction from high purity ( @xmath2099.999% ) lu@xmath21o@xmath0 and mno@xmath21 .",
    "the polycrystalline powder was pressed into rods of diameter 8 mm and length 80 mm , and sintered at 1300@xmath16c for 24 hours .",
    "single crystals were grown in a four - mirror optical floating - zone furnace ( crystal systems inc . ) at a scanning rate of 34mmhr@xmath22 with the feed and seed rods counter - rotating at 30rpm .",
    "the growth was performed in a flowing atmosphere of argon and oxygen in the ratio 12:1 . at each stage in the preparation the phase purity of the product was checked by powder x - ray diffraction .",
    "unpolarized neutron scattering measurements were performed on a crystal of mass 1.9 g on the cold - neutron triple - axis spectrometer tasp at the sinq facility ( psi , switzerland ) and on the thermal triple - axis 2t1 at llb - orphe ( saclay , france ) . at tasp ,",
    "the crystal was mounted in an ` orange ' helium cryostat and neutron spectra were recorded with a fixed final energy of 4.5mev .",
    "the corresponding setup at 2t1 was with a closed - cycle refrigerator and a fixed final energy of 14.7mev .",
    "measurements were made with either @xmath23 and @xmath24 or @xmath23 and @xmath25 in the horizontal scattering plane , where @xmath23 , @xmath25 and @xmath24 are the axes of the hexagonal reciprocal lattice .",
    "on 2t1 some measurements were also made in the plane parallel to the @xmath26 plane but displaced by 0.5 reciprocal lattice units along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "the lattice parameters of lumno@xmath0 referred to the space group @xmath3 are @xmath27@xmath28 , @xmath29@xmath30 , and the inter - axis angles are @xmath31@xmath16 , @xmath32@xmath16 .",
    "hence , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer on a small piece of crystal cut from the same rod as the neutron crystal .",
    "the thermal expansion was measured on the same piece of crystal with a miniature capacitance dilatometer@xcite .",
    "figure [ magnetization ] shows the magnetization of lumno@xmath0 for a magnetic field of strength 1000oe applied parallel to the @xmath5 plane and along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "magnetic ordering is signalled by a sharp peak in the magnetization at @xmath35k ( fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] lower inset ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the appearance of magnetic bragg peaks below @xmath15 in neutron diffraction data ( fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] upper inset ) .",
    "the magnetization exhibits a small anisotropy , being slightly larger when the field is applied parallel to the @xmath5 plane ( @xmath36 ) than along the c - axis .",
    "this easy - plane anisotropy is consistent with the observation that the moments lie in the plane in the ordered phase .",
    "the data follows a curie ",
    "weiss law at high temperatures ( not shown ) with a negative weiss temperature , @xmath37 . from fits of @xmath38 vs @xmath39",
    "we obtain @xmath40k from @xmath36 , and @xmath41k from @xmath42 .",
    "these values are close to those reported previously from single crystals@xcite , but somewhat larger in magnitude than obtained from powder samples@xcite .",
    "a clear cusp is seen at @xmath15 in @xmath43 whereas a broader peak is seen in @xmath36 .",
    "it has been suggested that the cusp in @xmath43 is caused by coupling between adjacent mn layers , and the more rounded peak in @xmath36 is due to frustration@xcite .",
    "examples of neutron scattering spectra from both instruments are presented in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "figure  [ spectrum](a ) shows energy scans recorded on tasp at the scattering vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , both of which contain two asymmetric peaks .",
    "figure  [ spectrum](b ) shows data at @xmath46 and @xmath47 measured on 2t1 .",
    "since the ordered moment on the mn sites is relatively large ( @xmath48@xmath49 ) the scattering from magnons is expected to be much stronger than phonon scattering at these relative small scattering vectors .",
    "this , together with the resemblance of the spectra to previous measurements on ymno@xmath0 , gives us confidence that the main features in the spectra correspond to magnon excitations .    to determine the magnon dispersion we fitted the peaks with gaussian or lorentzian functions ( depending on the peak shape ) on a linear background .",
    "the fitted peak positions have been collected together into a dispersion curve which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] , including data from both tasp and 2t1 .",
    "measurements on tasp extended from below 1mev up to about 13mev , while measurements at 2t1 covered the range from about 5mev up to the energy of the highest modes .",
    "measurements were performed in several different zones to find the maximum intensity and to check that the peaks were periodic in reciprocal space .",
    "figure  [ diffuse ] shows diffuse scattering measurements in the vicinity of the point @xmath50 in reciprocal space at temperatures close to @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath51 reflection has zero nuclear structure factor , and we observed zero magnetic intensity here at low temperatures .",
    "the scans in fig .",
    "[ diffuse ] reveal strong diffuse scattering at temperatures close to @xmath52 with maximum intensity at @xmath15 itself , as shown in the inset .",
    "the diffuse scattering is highly anisotropic , being very broad in the @xmath53 direction but much sharper in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "figure  [ the ] shows measurements of the thermal expansion of lumno@xmath0 parallel to the @xmath9 and @xmath8 axes .",
    "a magnetoelastic anomaly is clearly visible at the nel temperature , both in the strain @xmath55 and in its temperature derivative @xmath56 . on cooling through @xmath15",
    "the magnetoelastic strain expands the @xmath8 axis and shrinks the hexagonal plane . as a check",
    ", we also measured the thermal expansion in the hexagonal plane in the direction normal to @xmath9 .",
    "the data resemble the behaviour of @xmath57 to within the experimental error . above @xmath15",
    "the thermal expansion is highly anisotropic .",
    "the @xmath8-axis strain is almost temperature independent .",
    "we first review the magnetic structure of the @xmath1mno@xmath0 compounds @xcite , with particular reference to lumno@xmath0 .",
    "the six mn sites in the unit cell ( fig .  [ structure ] ) form two near - equilateral triangles , one in the @xmath58 layer and the other in the @xmath59 layer .",
    "the spins on these triangles lie in the basal plane and order in 120@xmath16 structures .",
    "symmetry constrains the relation between the @xmath58 and @xmath59 layers to two possibilities , conventionally labeled @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the @xmath60 structure",
    "the spin on the mn at @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is parallel to that at ( @xmath64 , whereas in the @xmath61 structure the spins on these two sites point in opposite directions .",
    "each spin makes an angle @xmath65 to the unit cell axis on which it lies , and the magnetic structure factors depend on @xmath65 and on the stacking relation ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) . for @xmath10",
    ", the magnetic structures occur in homometric pairs , such that the magnetic diffraction intensities for the configuration ( @xmath60 , @xmath65 ) are identical with those from ( @xmath61 , @xmath66 ) .    in the case of lumno@xmath0 ,",
    "katsufuji _ et al .",
    "_ concluded from neutron powder diffraction measurements@xcite that the low temperature structure is one of two possibilities , either ( @xmath60 , @xmath67 ) or ( @xmath61 , @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) .",

[ magnetization ] ) at the lowest temperature ( @xmath73k ) , in agreement with katsufuji _",
    "the homometric pairs can in principle be distinguished by optical second harmonic generation ( shg ) . using this method , fiebig _",
    "_ found that their sample of lumno@xmath0 was a two - phase mixture of @xmath60 structures with @xmath74 and an unspecified other @xmath65 value@xcite . since our low - temperature data , as well as that of ref .",
    ", conclusively rule out any @xmath60 structure which does not have @xmath75 it is difficult to see how to reconcile the diffraction and shg results . for the purpose of modeling the spin wave spectrum",
    "we will assume the ( @xmath60 , @xmath67 ) structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "the magnetic spectrum of this and its homometric partner are not distinguishable at the level of precision of our data .",
    "we calculated the spin wave spectrum from the spin hamiltonian @xmath76 with two in - plane near - neighbor interactions ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) and two inter - plane interactions ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) defined as shown in fig .  [ structure ] . the first summation in ( [ eq : spinwave ] ) is over pairs of spins with each pair counted once so that the @xmath81 constants are per spin pair .",
    "the second term models the out - of - plane anisotropy with a single - ion anisotropy parameter @xmath82 .",
    "we neglect the small in - plane anisotropy since the in - plane magnon gap was too small to measure in our experiment .",
    "analytic expressions have been given previously for the spin - wave energies derived from spin hamiltonians similar to ( [ eq : spinwave ] ) , refs .  .",
    "these expressions have been obtained via the usual transformation of the hamiltonian into a quadratic form of boson normal - mode operators in the linear approximation .",
    "here we use an alternative method based on dynamical matrix diagonalisation ( dmd ) as outlined in previous work @xcite , which is implemented in the mcphase software package@xcite .",
    "this formulation employs the random phase approximation to calculate the magnon cross sections in addition to the dispersion relations .",
    "there are six mn spins per unit cell , which gives rise to a total of six spin - wave modes for each wavevector . as the interlayer coupling is small",
    ", the in - plane dispersion relations appear as three branches each containing two nearly - degenerate modes .",
    "the degeneracy of the lowest two modes is lifted close to the @xmath83 point and along @xmath83z by the effect of the @xmath84 and @xmath85 interactions , while the upper four modes are almost degenerate along @xmath83z .",
    "this degeneracy precludes the possibility to fit accurate values for @xmath84 and @xmath85 independently , and so we chose to fix @xmath86 and to vary @xmath85 under the constraint that @xmath87 to maintain the stability of the @xmath60 structure .",
    "a least - squares fitting procedure returned the following values for the model parameters : @xmath88mev , @xmath89mev , @xmath90mev ( @xmath91 ) , and @xmath92mev .",
    "the calculated dispersion relations from the model with these parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] .",
    "the agreement is seen to be very good , and the parameters are well constrained by the data .",
    "for example , the 6.5mev gap to the upper mode at @xmath83 is sensitive to the single - ion anisotropy , and @xmath80 controls the dispersion in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "the splitting of the magnon peaks in the vicinity of the @xmath93 point , seen in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , is sensitive to the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "qualitative agreement between the measured and calculated magnon cross sections gave us further support for the obtained parameters .",
    "as a check , we calculated the bulk magnetization using the best - fit exchange and anisotropy parameters .",
    "the @xmath96 predicted by the mean - field model is about 2.5 times larger than the observed @xmath96 , presumably as a consequence of frustration .",
    "the calculated susceptibility has a small easy - plane anisotropy consistent with the measured susceptibility , fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] .",
    "the magnetization of the sample as a function of applied field ( not shown ) is linear and almost identical in the @xmath97 and @xmath98 directions .",
    "increasing the single - ion anisotropy in the model creates a step in the @xmath9-axis magnetization which is not observed .",
    "this adds to the evidence that the single - ion anisotropy is very small compared to the exchange interactions .",
    "the exchange parameters obtained here show that the dominant magnetic interaction is the in - plane antiferromagnetic superexchange via the @xmath99@xmath100 mn - o - mn path .",
    "the inter - layer superexchange is two orders of magnitude weaker , confirming that the magnetism in lumno@xmath0 is highly two - dimensional .",
    "it is interesting to compare the magnetic spectrum of lumno@xmath0 investigated here with those obtained from similar measurements on ymno@xmath0 ( refs .  ) and homno@xmath0 ( ref .  ) .",
    "qualitatively , the spectra of the three compounds look very similar , but the overall band width of the lumno@xmath0 spectrum is about 30% larger than that of ymno@xmath0 and homno@xmath0 ( 21mev compared with 16mev ) .",
    "consistent with this , the fitted exchange parameters for lumno@xmath0 are found to be systematically larger than those of ymno@xmath0 and homno@xmath0 .",
    "this accounts for the difference in the antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures of these compounds : @xmath101k ( lumno@xmath0 ) compared with @xmath102k ( ymno@xmath0 ) and @xmath103k ( homno@xmath0 ) and the larger weiss temperature of lumno@xmath0 ( @xmath104k ) compared with ymno@xmath0 ( @xmath105k)@xcite .",
    "the stronger magnetic interactions in lumno@xmath0 fits with the systematic trend in the ionic radii and the lattice parameters@xcite , i.e. the smaller the ionic radius the smaller the unit cell and the stronger the exchange interactions .",
    "the single - ion anisotropy parameter @xmath82 is also found to be larger for lumno@xmath0 ( @xmath106mev ) than for ymno@xmath0 ( @xmath107 to @xmath108mev ) and homno@xmath0 ( @xmath109mev ) .",
    "this could be another consequence of the small differences in the structural parameters of these compounds .",
    "the character of the diffuse scattering from lumno@xmath0 close to @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ diffuse ] ) strongly resembles that observed from ymno@xmath0.@xcite the appearance of scattering which is very broad along @xmath8 but relatively sharp in the plane indicates that the inter - layer correlations are very weak , consistent with the small @xmath84 and @xmath85 and two - dimensional nature of the magnetic system .",
    "the strong enhancement in the diffuse scattering intensity around @xmath50 was also observed in powder diffaction measurements on lumno@xmath0.@xcite these showed that the diffuse peak persists up to at least @xmath110,@xcite which was interpreted as evidence for strong geometric frustration .",
    "careful powder diffraction measurements@xcite have shown that the magnetically - induced ferroelectricity in @xmath1mno@xmath0 is associated with an isostructural transition involving an additional rotation of the mno@xmath111 bipyramids , and that the increase in ferroelectric polarization below @xmath15 scales with the square of the ordered moment .",
    "the thermal expansion of lumno@xmath0 reported here ( fig .  [ the ] ) reveals a striking magnetoelastic anomaly at @xmath15 , consistent with the diffraction data of lee _ et al . _",
    "( ref .  ) who argued that magnetoelastic coupling ( exchange striction ) is the primary source of the magnetoelectric coupling@xcite .",
    "one might expect , therefore , that the magnetoelectric effect would scale with the strength of the exchange interactions and hence be greater in lumno@xmath0 than in ymno@xmath0 .",
    "support for this idea is provided by the magnetically - induced polarization calculated from the measured atomic displacements below @xmath15 , which indeed appears to be systematically larger for lumno@xmath0 than for ymno@xmath0 ( ref .  ) .",
    "however , given the large experimental uncertainties in the values of the small atomic displacements this evidence should be considered tentative .    another notable feature of the thermal expansion is how small the @xmath8-axis thermal expansion is relative to the @xmath5 plane expansion above @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ the ] ) .",
    "this effect , which is observed both for lumno@xmath0 and ymno@xmath0 , does not correlate with the compressibility of these materials , which is similar along the @xmath8 direction and in the @xmath5 plane@xcite .",
    "the relatively isotropic compressibility suggests that the anomalous @xmath8-axis thermal expansion is not due to a straightforward anharmonicity in the interatomic potentials along the @xmath8 axis , and it would be interesting to find out what is responsible for it .    before concluding , we investigate the origin of the small magnetic anisotropy of lumno@xmath0 , which is represented in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : spinwave ] ) by the phenomenological @xmath112 term . for reference , we performed a point - charge calculation of the the crystal field at the mn sites assuming mn to be in the mn@xmath11 state with @xmath12 configuration and using the structural parameters reported by katsufuji _",
    "_ in ref .  .",
    "we included only the five nearest oxygen neighbors of mn in the mno@xmath111 bipyramid , as shown in fig .",
    "[ point charge ] .",
    "the ground - state @xmath13 manifold is split by the crystal field via the spin ",
    "orbit interaction .",
    "the calculated splitting , due to the crystal field alone , is also shown in fig .  [ point charge ] .",
    "this model of the crystal field predicts that the ordered magnetic moment points along the normal to the local mirror plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] , and with the inclusion of the exchange field from the neighboring mn ions predicts an anisotropy gap in the magnon spectrum of @xmath9910mev .",
    "this size of gap is in clear disagreement with the observed spin - wave modes , which have a gap of less than 1mev at the zone centre , fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] .",
    "the anisotropy gap may be reduced in the model if the local symmetry is increased to @xmath113 , i.e. by lessening the degree of mn trimerization and tilting of the mno@xmath111 bipyramid .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the single - ion anisotropy is controlled by a tiny distortion of the ideal mno@xmath111 bipyramid and that the anisotropy is much smaller than that predicted by a simple point - charge model .",
    "we have measured the magnon dispersion in lumno@xmath0 and achieved a very good description of the spectrum using the heisenberg hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinwave ] ) .",
    "we also observed a striking magnetoelastic coupling at @xmath15 in the thermal expansion .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those previously obtained on the sister compound ymno@xmath0 .",
    "the bandwidth of the one - magnon spectrum of lumno@xmath0 is about 30% larger than that of ymno@xmath0 , and the difference between the two nearest - neighbour in - plane exchange constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 is greater for lumno@xmath0 than for ymno@xmath0 . as the magnetic interactions are stronger in lumno@xmath0 than in ymno@xmath0 we expect the magnetically - induced ferroelectric polarization to be greater in lumno@xmath0 .",
