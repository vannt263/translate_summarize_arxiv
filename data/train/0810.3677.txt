    "at the lhc , top quark pairs ( @xmath3 ) will be produced mainly via gluon fusion .",
    "a recent prediction for the cross section at @xmath4 tev is a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation with soft - gluon next - to - leading - log ( nll ) resummation @xcite : @xmath5 ( factorisation and renormalisation scales ) @xmath6 ( parton distribution function ( pdf ) ) pb . as @xmath7 ,",
    "top quarks nearly always decay into a @xmath8-boson and a @xmath9-quark .",
    "a @xmath8-boson decays roughly 2/3@xmath10 of the cases into two quarks and 1/3@xmath10 into a lepton and a neutrino .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 decay can be divided into three channels : 4/9@xmath11 fully hadronic , 4/9@xmath11 semileptonic and 1/9@xmath11 dileptonic .",
    "the fully hadronic channel suffers from large qcd multi - jet background .",
    "the presence of missing transverse energy ( from undetectable neutrino s ) and at least one lepton in the two other channels creates the possibility to select @xmath3 events while reducing background considerably .",
    "these two channels are used in atlas for @xmath3 cross section measurements with the first 100pb@xmath2 integrated luminosity of data @xcite and will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "two complementary measurements in the single lepton channel are investigated : a counting method and a likelihood fit .",
    "events are selected that passed the electron ( muon ) trigger ` e22i ` ( ` mu20 ` ) and contain missing transverse energy @xmath12 gev , an isolated electron ( muon ) with transverse momentum @xmath13 gev / c and pseudo rapidity @xmath14 , three jets with @xmath15 gev / c and @xmath14 and an additional fourth jet with @xmath13 gev / c and @xmath14 .",
    "the hadronic top is reconstructed by taking the invariant mass @xmath16 of the three jet combination with the highest @xmath17 . to reduce background from jet combinatorics and other processes , at least one di - jet combination is required to be compatible with the @xmath8-boson mass @xmath18 gev / c@xmath19 .         in the counting method",
    "the cross section is determined by subtracting the number of expected background events from the number of observed events in the @xmath16 distribution divided by the selection efficiency and integrated luminosity .",
    "the main background comes from @xmath8 + jets and single top .",
    "when tagging of @xmath9-quark jets is possible , the purity can be increased by a factor four , while the efficiency is only reduced by a factor two . the largest systematic uncertainty ( @xmath2010% ) in this analysis",
    "is the background normalisation .    in the likelihood fit ,",
    "only the correctly reconstructed @xmath3 events that end up in the peak of the distribution are used for the cross section measurement .",
    "the peak is fitted with a gaussian , while the combined background shape from jet combinatorics and other processes such as @xmath8 + jets is described by a chebychev polynomial .",
    "the cross section is calculated from the number of @xmath3 events in the peak divided by the overall efficiency for a @xmath3 event to end up in the peak and the integrated luminosity .",
    "the fit is sensitive to the shapes of the distribution and therefore this is the main systematic uncertainty ( @xmath2010% ) .",
    "the expected uncertainties on the cross section for 100 pb@xmath2 of data are :            m. cacciari , s. frixione , m.l .",
