    "ray binaries are binary systems in which a @xmath8 star transfers matter to a neutron star or a black hole . a large fraction of the low  mass x ",
    "ray binaries are transient systems  the so called soft x  ray transients ( sxts ; e.g.  see @xcite ) . before the launch of the xmm  newton and _ chandra _ satellites only a few ( mostly ) nearby sxts could be studied in quiescence ( e.g.  the black hole candidates a  062000 and v404  cyg and the neutron star systems cen  x4 and aql  x1 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) . using the xmm ",
    "newton and _ chandra _ satellites many more systems were studied in quiescence in the initial years of operation ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "contemporaneous theoretical progress provided the framework for the interpretation of these observations ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; ; ) which turned out to have a profound impact on two important areas of high energy astrophysics .",
    "first , comparing the quiescent luminosity of neutron star sxts with that of black hole sxts it was found that black hole ( bh ) sxts are systematically fainter in quiescence than neutron stars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for advection of energy across a bh event horizon .",
    "if true this would constitute the first confirmation of a prediction of einstein s theory of general relativity in the strong field regime . despite many objections to this interpretation ( @xcite ; ) , alternative explanations for the difference in quiescent luminosity ( @xcite ) , and neutron stars which turned out to be fainter than initially found to be the rule ( e.g.  sax  j1808.43658 , @xcite ; exo  1747214 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2005 ) , none of the neutron star sxts have quiescent luminosities as low as the faintest bh sxts , which have 0.510 kev luminosities @xmath9 erg s@xmath2 ; ( e.g.  @xcite , ) .",
    "hence , irrespective of the interpretation , the difference in quiescent luminosity between bh and neutron star sxts seems to be one of the very few distinct characteristics between bhs and neutron stars .    secondly , the quiescent spectra of neutron star sxts are well  fit by a neutron star atmosphere model ( nsa ) sometimes supplemented with a power  law component . especially in sources with a quiescent luminosity near @xmath10 erg",
    "s@xmath2 the spectrum is dominated by a strong thermal component ( @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal component is thought to be due to the hot neutron star core moderated by the neutron star atmosphere .",
    "the neutron star core temperature can be calculated by combining well established theories about the time  averaged mass accretion rates in neutron star sxts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the pycnonuclear reactions taking place in the neutron star crust ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) and theoretical neutron star cooling predictions ( see for a review ) .",
    "therefore , in theory , an nsa  fit provides means to measure the mass and radius of the neutron star and hence constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at supranuclear densities .",
    "the description of the relations between pressure and density of matter ( the eos ) under the extreme conditions encountered in neutron stars is one of the ultimate goals of the study of neutron stars .    in practice ,",
    "numbers typical for a canonical neutron star were found ( e.g.  @xcite ) , rendering support for this interpretation .",
    "however , there is an ongoing debate whether the temperature of the thermal ( nsa ) component is varying on short timescales ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "small temperature changes could be explained by changes in the neutron star atmosphere due to ongoing low ",
    "level accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "large changes on short timescales would render it unlikely that the soft / thermal component is due to cooling of the neutron star , limiting the applicability of the nsa model fit .",
    "finally , there are currently two sources known which returned to quiescence after a several year  long accretion epoch ( i.e.  ks  1731260 and mxb  1659298 ) . as a result of these long accretion episodes the neutron star _ crust _ is heated to temperatures larger than that of the core .",
    "the observed thermal spectral component has been identified as cooling of the neutron star crust ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as the crust cools the x  ray spectral properties also change slightly ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of accretion powered millisecond x  ray pulsars in quiescence found that the quiescent luminosity of many of those observed so far , not just sax  j1808.43658 , is low ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "a possible exception could be the accretion ",
    "powered millisecond x ",
    "ray pulsar igr  j00291 + 5934 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the x  ray spectrum is in most cases dominated by a power  law component similar to that of quiescent bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the dichotomy between the bh and neutron star quiescent luminosity may not be as large as previously derived ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note however , that reliable distance estimates could be made for only 2 accretion powered millisecond systems , sax  j1808.43658 and xte  j1814338 (; @xcite ) . for the other systems the distance estimates are rather uncertain , making the quiescent luminosity uncertain as well .",
    "the low  luminosity and the small contribution of a thermal spectral component to the luminosity of sax  j1808.43658 ( @xmath1110% ; @xcite , although see the comment about this upper limit in @xcite ) hint at a massive neutron star ( @xmath12 ; , ) . the upper limit on the thermal spectral component implies that the neutron star core of sax  j1808.43658 must release the energy produced in the crust due to pycnonuclear reactions rapidly via enhanced neutrino emission .",
    "this enhanced neutrino emission can only occur when the neutron star mass is larger than the canonical 1.4 @xmath13 .",
    "1h  1905 + 000 was first detected on mjd  42368 ( utc ) by ariel  5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "six type i x  ray bursts were discovered on different occasions by sas3 firmly establishing the nature of the compact object as a neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the last reported detection of the source was that by exosat on mjd  46316 ( utc ) .",
    "a radius expansion burst was detected on this occasion ( ) . during the period of activity",
    "the source has also been detected with heao1 and einstein ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "however , the source was not detected in the rosat all sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source likely went to quiescence at the end of the 1980s / early 1990s .",
    "next , 1h  1905 + 000 was observed for 5 ks with the back  illuminated s3 ccd  chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector on board the _ chandra _ satellite with the high  energy transmission grating inserted ( @xcite ) .",
    "again no source was detected at the position of the optical counterpart discovered when the source was in outburst ( ) .",
    "the derived upper limit on the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux for 1h  1905 + 000 was 1@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath2 for an assumed black body spectrum with a temperature of 0.3 kev .",
    "the distance for 1h  1905 + 000 derived from the observed radius expansion burst peak flux is 7.3 or 10 kpc ( @xcite ; the values assume hydrogen and helium bursts , respectively ) . from einstein observations @xcite determined that the interstellar extinction , n@xmath16 , to 1h  1905 + 000 is @xmath17 @xmath15 .",
    "this yields an upper limit to the intrinsic ( i.e.  corrected for the interstellar extinction ) 0.510 kev source luminosity of @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 for 1h  1905 + 000 . in summary",
    ", it is likely that the source had been accreting steadily at l@xmath19 erg s@xmath2 for more than 10 years before returning to quiescence . in this paper",

    "_ chandra _ observation of this neutron star sxt in quiescence .",
    "furthermore , our analysis of very large telescope and magellan optical observations of the region of the source in quiescence is also presented .",
    "in order to determine the best ( optical ) position of 1h  1905 + 000 and to search for the optical counterpart in quiescence , we have obtained i  band images with exposure times of 10  seconds and 2x300 seconds using the inamori ",

    "the seeing was 0.69 . using the second usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac2 ) catalogue ( @xcite ) we determined the position of 71 bright , unsaturated , stars in the 10second imacs image to obtain an astrometric solution ( the rms of the fit was 0060 both in right ascension [ @xmath20 and in declination [ @xmath21 ) .",
    "subsequently , the astrometric solution of the 10second frame was transferred to the 300second images using 1397 stars . in this",

    "each of these images has an exposure time of 10 seconds .",
    "we corrected for bias using the overscan region of the ccd , however , no white light flatfield images are available since these images were acquisition images for spectroscopic observations ( see below ) . therefore , we could not correct for pixel  to  pixel variations in sensitivity .",
    "we used psf  fitting in order to determine the relative brightness of the two stars present close to the position of the optical counterpart in outburst ( see fig .",

    "we were able to use 12 out of the 14 acquisition observations for which the seeing conditions were 0.450.82to search for white light variability .",

    "the change in position with respect to other field stars is less than 0.1over the 20 year that separate the cfht v  band outburst observations and the magellan i  band observations .",

    "the observations reported here show that at least some of the neutron star sxts can be as faint as the faintest black hole sxts in quiescence .",
    "the claim that the comparison between the black hole and neutron star luminosity in sxts in quiescence provides evidence for a black hole event horizon is hence difficult to maintain . when comparing eddington scaled neutron star and black hole luminosities , as has been done often in the literature , black hole sxts are still less luminous than their neutron star counterparts .",
    "the reasoning behind such a scaling stems from the notion that at orbital periods of the order of hours the gravitational wave radiation driven mass transfer rate for neutron stars and black holes is roughly similar when scaled to the eddington rate _ if the companion stars are main sequence stars _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , for ultra  compact systems ( as 1h  1905 + 000 likely is ) the companion star can not be a main sequence star making the eddington scaling arbitrary . furthermore , it is unclear whether the mass transfer rate set by the orbital period and the instantaneous mass accretion rate have a one  to  one correspondence in quiescent systems .",
    "the low luminosity in quiescence can potentially be used together with the neutron star cooling theory to put constraints on the presence of condensates in the neutron star core ( ) . besides the core cooling mechanism we can constrain the thermal relaxation time and hence thermal conductivity of the neutron star crust . since we do not detect the neutron star less than 20 years after the 11 year long outburst",
    "the neutron star crust must have a thermal relaxation time less than 20 years .",
    "however , presently the data does not allow us to distinguish between crustal conductivity set by electron  phonon conductivity ( @xcite ) or by electron  ion scattering ( @xcite ) , since the inclusion of cooper  pair neutrino emission in the crust alters the description considerably with respect to the status presented in @xcite ( e.g.  see ) .",
    "currently , less than 20 years after the outburst , the quiescent luminosity is determined by the core cooling processes again .",
    "however , to estimate the core temperature the average mass accretion rate over the last 10@xmath68 - 10@xmath69 year has to be known ( @xcite ) .",

    "ray binary ( outside globular clusters ) is the orbital period . in case of 1h  1905 + 000",
    "the orbital period is unknown .",
    "however , as explained above , it is likely that 1h  1905 + 000 is an ultra  compact x ",
    "ray binary . the mass accretion rate for an ultra  compact system depends on the exact orbital period and the nature and age of the companion star but it can be as low as @xmath70 m@xmath5 yr@xmath2 if the system is @xmath3210 gyr old and if the orbital period is 6090 minutes ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "if indeed the time averaged mass accretion rate is this low , the current limit on the luminosity does not provide a constraint on the core cooling .",
    "however , at such low mass transfer rates it might be difficult to feed an outburst that lasts longer than 11 years where the x  ray luminosity is @xmath71 erg s@xmath2 as in the case of 1h  1905 + 000 . in order to sustain such an accretion rate for 11 years",
    "the neutron star should have accreted @xmath72 m@xmath5 .",
    "if the mass transfer rate is 10@xmath73/@xmath74 m@xmath5 yr@xmath2 then it would take at least 3.5@xmath75/3.5@xmath76 year to build  up the accretion disc . in both cases",
    "this is a significant fraction of the core heating timescale .",
    "@xcite showed that in such a case the fraction of the heat released deep in the crust that is used to heat the core is smaller than 1 . assuming that the fraction is not less than 0.1 in 1h  1905 + 000 then , following @xcite we derive that for a time averaged mass accretion rate larger than @xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath2",
    ", enhanced neutrino emission processes must be operating in the core .",
    "next , we discuss the possibility that systematic effects make 1h  1905 + 000 appear faint in quiescence whereas the true luminosity in quiescence is significantly higher .",
    "we shall show , however , that this is unlikely .",
    "if the distance is systematically underestimated the source luminosity may be higher .",
    "however , the distance for 1h  1905 + 000 is derived from the observed radius expansion burst peak flux .",
    "have calibrated this distance estimation method comparing the distances derived from the burst peak fluxes of sources in globular clusters to the accurately known distances of those globular clusters . from their work it can be seen that if the composition of the burning material is known ( hydrogen or helium rich burning material ) the peak burst flux gives a reliable estimate of the distance ( to within approximately 15 per cent ) . in",
    "compact systems hydrogen is likely depleted ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a possible binary evolutionary scenario leading to ultra ",
    "compact systems with some hydrogen still present ) .",
    "therefore , it is save to assume that the radius expansion burst peak flux corresponds to the helium eddington limit luminosity . in case of 1h  1905 + 000",
    "this helium radius expansion burst limit on the distance is 10 kpc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if however , hydrogen was present in the burning material the distance becomes smaller , making the upper limit on the quiescent luminosity more stringent still .",
    "the interstellar extinction , n@xmath16 , towards 1h  1905 + 000 is low compared to that found for most other low  mass x ",
    "ray binaries . from einstein observations",
    "obtained when the source was in outburst christian & swank ( 1997 ) determined that the n@xmath16 to 1h  1905 + 000 is @xmath17  @xmath15 .",
    "typically , for many sxts it is found that the interstellar extinction probed by n@xmath16 is somewhat higher in outburst than in quiescence ( @xcite ) .",
    "for that reason it is unlikely that the neutron star quiescent luminosity is much higher but that the source is hidden from our view due to an interstellar extinction that is much larger than measured in outburst .",
    "previous observations of several accretion  powered millisecond x  ray pulsars in quiescence have also shown that many of those sources have a low quiescent luminosity ( e.g.  sax  j1808.43658 , @xcite , xte  j0929314 and xte  j1751305 , @xcite , xte  j1807294 , ) . however , except for sax  j1808.43658 , the distance estimates for these systems are uncertain which makes the quiescent luminosity uncertain as well .",
    "although , in order for these systems to have a luminosity @xmath77 , i.e.  similar to that observed for aql  x1 and xte  j1709267 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the distance has to be unrealistically large , e.g.  @xmath78 kpc for xte  j0929314 .",
    "the planned deep ( 300 ksec ) _ chandra _ x  ray observation of 1h  1905 + 000 will provide new constraints on or a measurement of the quiescent neutron star luminosity in this system .",
