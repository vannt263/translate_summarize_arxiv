    "it is widely recognized that euclidean quantum gravity ( eqg ) is a lame duck in modern particle physics and cosmology .",
    "after its summit in early and late eighties ( in the form of the cosmological wavefunction proposals @xcite and baby universes boom @xcite ) the interest in this theory gradually declined , especially , in cosmological context , where the problem of quantum initial conditions was superseded by the concept of stochastic inflation @xcite .",
    "eqg could not stand the burden of indefiniteness of the euclidean gravitational action @xcite and the cosmology debate of the tunneling vs no - boundary proposals @xcite .",
    "thus , a recently suggested eqg density matrix of the universe @xcite is hardly believed to be a viable candidate for the initial state of the universe , even though it avoids the infrared catastrophe of small cosmological constant @xmath0 , generates an ensemble of quasi - thermal universes in the limited range of @xmath0 , and suggests a strong selection mechanism for the landscape of string vacua @xcite . here",
    "we want to give a brief overview of these results and also justify them by deriving from first principles of lorentzian quantum gravity applied to a microcanonical ensemble of closed cosmological models @xcite . in view of the peculiarities of spatially closed cosmology",
    "this ensemble describes ultimate ( unit weight ) equipartition in the physical phase space of the theory .",
    "this can be interpreted as a sum over everything , thus emphasizing a distinguished role of this candidate for the initial state of the universe .",
    "we analyze the cosmological evolution in this model with the initial conditions set by the instantons of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we derive the modified friedmann equation incorporating the effect of the conformal anomaly at late radiation and matter domination stages @xcite .",
    "this equation shows that the vacuum ( casimir ) part of the energy density is `` degravitated '' via the effect of the conformal anomaly  the casimir energy does not weigh . moreover , together with the recovery of the general relativistic behavior , this equation can feature a stage of cosmological acceleration followed by what we call a _ big boost _ singularity @xcite . at this singularity",
    "the scale factor acceleration grows in finite cosmic time up to infinity with a finite limiting value of the hubble factor , when the universe again enters a quantum phase demanding for its description an uv completion of the low - energy semiclassical theory .",
    "then we discuss the hierarchy problem in this scenario which necessarily arises when trying to embrace within one model both the inflationary and acceleration ( dark energy ) stages of the cosmological evolution . the attempt to solve this problem via",
    "the ( string - inspired ) concept of evolving extra dimensions brings us to the ads / cft and braneworld setups @xcite , including the randall - sundrum and dgp models tightly linked by duality relations to our anomaly driven cosmology .",

    "but @xmath49 can be renormalized to zero by adding a finite _ local _ counterterm @xmath54 admissible by the renormalization theory .",
    "we assume this _ number of degrees of freedom preserving _ renormalization to keep theory consistent both at the classical and quantum levels @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that this finite renormalization changes the value of the casimir energy of conformal fields in closed einstein cosmology in such a way that for all spins this energy is universally expressed in terms of the same conformal anomaly coefficient @xmath34 ( corresponding to the @xmath55 term in ( [ frieeu ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this leads to the gravitational screening of the casimir energy , mediated by the conformal anomaly of quantum fields .",
    "ultimately , the effective action ( [ frieeu ] ) contains only two dimensional constants  the planck mass squared ( or the gravitational constant ) @xmath56 and the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "they have to be considered as renormalized quantities .",
    "indeed , the effective action of conformal fields contains divergences , the quartic and quadratic ones being absorbed by the renormalization of the initially singular bare cosmological and gravitational constants to yield finite renormalized @xmath57 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "logarithmically divergent counterterms have the same structure as curvature invariants in the anomaly ( [ anomaly ] ) . when integrated over the spacetime closed toroidal frw instantons they identically vanish",
    "because the @xmath58 term is a total derivative , the euler number @xmath59 of @xmath60 is zero , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "there is however a finite tail of these vanishing logarithmic divergences in the form of the conformal anomaly action which incorporates the coefficient @xmath40 of @xmath59 in ( [ anomaly ] ) and constitutes a major contribution to @xmath63  the first two @xmath34-dependent terms of ( [ effaction ] ) . ] .",
    "thus , in fact , this model when considered in the leading order of the @xmath64-expansion ( therefore disregarding loop effects of the graviton and other non - conformal fields ) is renormalizable in the minisuperspace sector of the theory .",

    "the latter is given in ( [ bootstrap ] ) by the @xmath72-fold integral between the turning points of the scale factor history @xmath18 , @xmath73 .",
    "this @xmath72-fold nature implies that in the periodic solution the scale factor oscillates @xmath72 times between its maximum and minimum values @xmath74 , see fig.[fig.3 ]    as shown in @xcite , such solutions represent garland - type instantons which exist only in the limited range of values of the cosmological constant @xmath75 and eliminate the vacuum hartle - hawking instantons corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "hartle - hawking instantons are ruled out in the statistical sum by their infinite positive effective action which is due to the contribution of the conformal anomaly .",
    "hence the tree - level predictions of the theory are drastically changed .",
    "the upper bound of the range ( [ landscape ] ) is entirely caused by the quantum anomaly ",
    "it represents a new quantum gravity scale which tends to infinity when one switches the quantum effects off , @xmath77 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath78 can be attributed to both radiation and anomaly , and can be obtained numerically for any field content of the model . for a large number of conformal fields , and therefore a large @xmath40 ,",
    "the lower bound is of the order @xmath79 .",
    "thus the restriction ( [ landscape ] ) can be regarded as a solution of the cosmological constant problem in the early universe , because specifying a sufficiently high number of conformal fields one can achieve a primordial value of @xmath0 well below the planck scale where the effective theory applies , but high enough to generate a sufficiently long inflationary stage .",
    "also this restriction can be potentially considered as a selection criterion for the landscape of string vacua @xcite .",

    "exact operator realization @xmath97 is not known except the first two orders of a semiclassical @xmath98-expansion @xcite .",
    "fortunately , we do not need a precise form of these constraints , because we will proceed with their path - integral solutions adjusted to the semiclassical perturbation theory .",
    "the very essence of our proposal is the interpretation of ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ micro ] ) as the density matrix of a _ microcanonical _ ensemble in spatially closed quantum cosmology .",
    "a simplest analogy is the density matrix of an unconstrained system having a conserved hamiltonian @xmath99 in the microcanonical state with a fixed energy @xmath59 , @xmath100 .",
    "a major distinction of ( [ micro ] ) from this case is that spatially closed cosmology does not have freely specifiable constants of motion like the energy or other global charges .",
    "rather it has as constants of motion the hamiltonian and momentum constraints @xmath101 , all having a particular value  zero .",
    "therefore , the expression ( [ micro ] ) can be considered as a most general and natural candidate for the quantum state of the _ closed _ universe .",
    "below we confirm this fact by showing that in the physical sector the corresponding statistical sum is a uniformly distributed ( with a unit weight ) integral over entire phase space of true physical degrees of freedom . thus , this is the sum over everything .",

    "this is not unusual now to suggest a solution to the hierarchy problem by introducing a gigantic number of quantum fields , like it has been done in @xcite in the form of @xmath182 replicas of the standard model resolving the leap between the electroweak and planck scales .",
    "whatever speculative are such suggestions , we would consider a similar mechanism in our case even though we would have to consider a much bigger jump of about hundred twenty orders of magnitude .",
    "so what can be the mechanism of a variable and indefinitely growing @xmath40 ?",
    "one such mechanism was suggested in @xcite .",
    "it relies on the possible existence , motivated by string theory , of extra dimensions whose size is evolving in time .",
    "theories with extra dimensions can promote @xmath40 to the level of a modulus variable which can grow with the evolving size @xmath123 of those dimensions , as we now explain .",
    "indeed , the parameter @xmath40 basically counts the number @xmath183 of conformal degrees of freedom , @xmath184 ( see eq.([100 ] ) ) .",
    "however , if one considers a string theory in a spacetime with more than four dimensions , the extra - dimension being compact with typical size @xmath123 , the effective 4-dimensional fields arise as kaluza - klein ( kk ) and winding modes with masses ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath185 ( where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are respectively the kk and winding numbers ) , which break their conformal symmetry .",
    "these modes remain approximately conformally invariant as long as their masses are much smaller than the spacetime curvature , @xmath188 .",
    "therefore the number of conformally invariant modes changes with @xmath123 .",
    "simple estimates show that the number of pure kk modes ( @xmath189 , @xmath190 ) grows with @xmath123 as @xmath191 , whereas the number of pure winding modes ( @xmath192 , @xmath193 ) grows as @xmath123 decreases as @xmath194 .",
    "thus , it is possible to find a growing @xmath40 in both cases with expanding or contracting extra dimensions .",
    "in the first case it is the growing tower of superhorizon kk modes which _ makes _ the horizon scale @xmath195 decrease as @xmath123 increases to infinity . in the second case",
    "it is the tower of superhorizon winding modes which makes this scale decrease with the decreasing @xmath123 as @xmath196 at the qualitative level of this discussion , such a scenario is flexible enough to accommodate the present day acceleration scale ( though , at the price of fine - tuning an enormous coefficient governing the expansion or contraction of @xmath123 ) .",
    "string ( or rather string - inspired ) models can offer a more explicit construction of these ideas within the ads / cft picture .",
    "indeed , in this picture @xcite a higher dimensional theory of gravity , namely type iib supergravity compactified on @xmath197 , is seen to be equivalent to a four dimensional conformal theory , namely @xmath198 @xmath199 sym , thought to live on the boundary of @xmath200 space - time .",
    "this picture underlies the randall - sundrum model @xcite where a 3-brane embedded into the @xmath200 space - time enjoys in a large distance limit a recovery of the 4d gravity theory without the need for compactification @xcite .",
    "this model has a dual description .",
    "on the one hand it can be considered from a 5d gravity perspective , on the other hand it can also be described , thanks to the ads / cft correspondence , by a 4d conformal field theory coupled to gravity .    to be more precise , the 5d sugra",
    " a field - theoretic limit of compactified type iib string theory  induces on the brane of the underlying ads background the quantum effective action of the conformally invariant 4d @xmath198 @xmath199 sym theory coupled to the 4d geometry of the boundary .",
    "the multiplets of this cft contributing according to ( [ 100 ] ) to the total conformal anomaly coefficient @xmath40 are given by @xmath201 @xcite , so that @xmath202 the parameters of the two theories are related by the equation @xcite @xmath203 where @xmath123 is the radius of the 5d @xmath204 space - time with the negative cosmological constant @xmath205 and @xmath206 is the 5d gravitational constant .",
    "the radius @xmath123 is also related to the t hooft parameter of the sym coupling @xmath207 and the string length scale @xmath208 , @xmath209 .",
    "the generation of the 4d cft from the local 5d supergravity holds in the limit when both @xmath52 and @xmath210 are large .",
    "this guarantees the smallness of string corrections and establishes the relation between the weakly coupled tree - level gravity theory in the bulk ( @xmath211 , @xmath212 ) and the strongly coupled 4d cft ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "moreover , as said above , the ads / cft correspondence explains the mechanism of recovering general relativity theory on the 4d brane of the randall - sundrum model @xcite . the 4d gravity theory is induced on the brane from the 5d theory with the negative cosmological constant @xmath205 . in the one - sided version of this model",
    "the brane has a tension @xmath214 ( the 4d cosmological constant is given by @xmath215 ) , and the 4d gravitational constant @xmath216 turns out to be @xmath217 one recovers 4d general relativity at low energies and for distances larger than the radius of the ads bulk , @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the cft dual description of the 5d randall - sundrum model is very similar to the model considered above .",
    "moreover , even though the cft effective action is not exactly calculable for @xmath218 it is generally believed that its conformal anomaly is protected by extended susy @xcite and is exactly given by the one - loop result ( [ anomaly ] ) .",
    "therefore it generates the exact effective action of the anomalous ( conformal ) degree of freedom given by ( [ effaction ] ) , which guarantees a good @xmath219-approximation for the gravitational dynamics .    applying further the above relations it follows a relation between our @xmath40 coefficient and the radius @xmath123 of the @xmath204 space - time , given by @xmath220 . introducing this in the modified friedmann equation ( [ modfriedmann ] ) ,",
    "the latter becomes explicitly depending on the size of the 5d ads spacetime as given by @xmath221 where we have reintroduced the decomposition ( [ split ] ) of the full matter density into the decay product of the inflationary and matter domination stages , with energy density @xmath222 , and the thermal excitations of the primordial cft ( [ primrad ] ) .    for low energy density , @xmath223 and @xmath224 , in the approximation beyond the leading order , cf .",
    "eq.([gr ] ) , the modified friedmann equation coincides with the modified friedmann equation in the randall - sundrum model @xcite @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the randall - sundrum brane tension and @xmath227 is the braneworld constant of motion @xcite",
    ". grows , faster than the matter term and expand to the second order in @xmath222 , but the first order in @xmath228 . ]",
    "note that the thermal radiation on the brane ( of non - casimir energy nature ) is equivalent to the mass of the bulk black hole associated with this constant .",
    "this fact can be regarded as another manifestation of the ads / cft correspondence in view of the known duality between the bulk black hole and the thermal cft on the brane @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this comparison between our model and the randall - sundrum framework also allows one to have some insight on the phenomenologically allowed physical scales .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the presence of an extra - dimension in the randall - sundrum model , or in the dual language , that of the cft , manifests itself typically at distances lower than the @xmath204 radius @xmath123 .",
    "hence , it is perfectly possible to have a large number of conformal fields in the universe , _  la _ randall - sundrum , without noticing their presence in the everyday experiments , provided @xmath123 is small enough .",
    "moreover , if one uses the scenario of @xcite to set the initial conditions for inflation , it provides an interesting connection between the hubble radius of inflation , given by eq .",
    "( [ landscape ] ) , and the distance at which the presence of the cft would manifest itself in gravity experiments , both being given by @xmath123 .",
    "last , it seems natural in a string theory setting , to imagine that the @xmath204 radius @xmath123 can depend on time , and hence on the scale factor .    in this case , assuming that the ads / cft picture still holds when @xmath123 is adiabatically evolving , one can consider the possibility that @xmath229 is large , and that @xmath230 grows faster than @xmath231 decreases during the cosmological expansion .",
    "one would then get the cosmological acceleration scenario of the above type followed by the big boost singularity .    in this case , however , should this acceleration scenario correspond to the present day accelerated expansion , @xmath123 should be of the order of the present size of the universe , i.e. @xmath232 . since the randall - sundrum mechanism recovers 4d gr only at distances beyond the curvature radius of the ads bulk , @xmath233 , it means that local gravitational physics of our model ( [ modfriedmann2 ] ) at the acceleration stage is very different from the 4d general relativity .",
    "thus this mechanism can hardly be a good candidate for generating dark energy in real cosmology .",
    "it is interesting that there exists an even more striking example of a braneworld setup dual to our anomaly driven model .",
    "this is the generalized dgp model @xcite including together with the 4d and 5d einstein - hilbert terms also the 5d cosmological constant , @xmath234 , in the special case of the _ vacuum _ state on the brane with a vanishing matter density @xmath235 .",
    "in contrast to the randall - sundrum model , for which this duality holds only in the low energy limit  small @xmath222 and small @xmath151 , vacuum dgp cosmology _ exactly _ corresponds to the model of @xcite with the 4d cosmological constant @xmath0 simulated by the 5d cosmological constant @xmath234 .",
    "indeed , in this model ( provided one neglects the bulk curvature ) , gravity interpolates between a 4d behaviour at small distances and a 5d behaviour at large distances , with the crossover scale between the two regimes being given by @xmath236 , @xmath237 and in the absence of stress - energy exchange between the brane and the bulk , the modified friedmann equation takes the form @xcite @xmath238 here @xmath227 is the same as above constant of integration of the bulk einstein s equation , which corresponds to a nonvanishing weyl tensor in the bulk ( or a mass for a schwarzschild geometry in the bulk ) @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that this equation with @xmath235 exactly coincides with the modified friedmann equation of the anomaly driven cosmology ( [ friedmann3 ] ) under the identifications @xmath239 these identifications imply that in the dgp limit @xmath240 , the anomaly coefficient @xmath40 is much larger than 1 .",
    "this looks very much like the generation of the vacuum dgp model for any value of the dark radiation @xmath151 from the anomaly driven cosmology with a very large @xmath241 .",
    "however , there are several differences .",
    "a first important difference between the conventional dgp model and the anomaly driven dgp is that the former does not incorporate the self - accelerating branch @xcite of the latter .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that only one sign of the square root is admissible in eq.([friedmann0 ] )  a property dictated by the instanton initial conditions at the nucleation of the lorentzian spacetime from the euclidean one .",
    "so , one does not have to worry about possible instabilities associated with the self - accelerating branch .",
    "another important difference concerns the way the matter energy density manifests itself in the friedmann equation for the non - vacuum case . in our 4d anomaly",
    "driven model it enters the right hand side of the equation as a result of the decay ( [ split ] ) of the effective 4d cosmological constant @xmath0 , while in the dgp model it appears inside the parenthesis of the left hand side of equation ( [ friedmanndgp ] ) .",
    "therefore , the dgp hubble factor reads as @xmath242 ( note the negative sign of @xmath222 under the square root and the extra first term on the right hand side ) . in the limit of small @xmath222 , @xmath151 and @xmath234 , the above equation yields a very different behavior from the gr limit of the anomaly driven model ( [ gr ] ) , @xmath243 for vanishing @xmath234 and @xmath151 this behavior corresponds to the 5d dynamical phase @xcite which is realized in the dgp model for a very small matter energy density on the brane @xmath244 .",
    "of course , in this range the dgp braneworld reduces to a vacuum brane , but one can also imagine that the 5d cosmological constant decays into matter constituents similar to ( [ split ] ) and thus simulates the effect of @xmath222 in eq.([modfriedmann ] ) .",
    "this can perhaps provide us with a closer correspondence between the anomaly driven cosmology and the non - vacuum dgp case .",
    "but here we would prefer to postpone discussions of such scenarios to future analyses and , instead , focus on the generalized _ single - branch _ dgp model to show that it also admits the cosmological acceleration epoch followed by the big boost singularity .    indeed , for positive @xmath234 satisfying a very weak bound @xmath245 eq.([modfriedmanndgp ] ) has a solution for which , during the cosmological expansion with @xmath246 , the argument of the square root vanishes and the acceleration tends to @xmath247 . for the effective @xmath51-dependence of @xmath248 and @xmath249 analogous to ( [ behavior ] ) , @xmath250 and @xmath251 ,",
    "the acceleration becomes positive at least for @xmath252 , @xmath253 this is the big boost singularity labeled by @xmath169 and having a finite hubble factor @xmath254 .",
    "thus , the _ single - branch _ dgp cosmology can also lead to a big boost version of acceleration . for that to happen",
    ", one does not actually need a growing @xmath236 ( which can be achieved at the price of having a time dependent @xmath206  itself some kind of a modulus , in a string inspired picture ) .",
    "the dgp crossover scale @xmath236 can be constant , @xmath192 , and the big boost singularity will still occur provided the lower bound ( [ bound ] ) is satisfied .. however , the latter is very small at late stages of expansion . ]",
    "when @xmath234 violates this bound , the acceleration stage is eternal with an asymptotic value of the hubble factor squared @xmath255 given by @xmath256 .",
    "to summarize , within a minimum set of assumptions ( the equipartition in the physical phase space ( [ everything ] ) ) , we have a mechanism to generate a limited range of a positive cosmological constant which is likely to constrain the landscape of string vacua and get the full evolution of the universe as a quasi - equilibrium decay of its initial microcanonical state .",
    "thus , contrary to anticipations of sidney coleman that  there is nothing rather than something \" regarding the actual value of the cosmological constant @xcite , one can say that something ( rather than nothing ) comes from everything .",
    "we have obtained the modified friedmann equation for this evolution in the anomaly dominated cosmology .",
    "this equation exhibits a gravitational screening of the quantum casimir energy of conformal fields  this part of the total energy density does not weigh , being degravitated due to the contribution of the conformal anomaly . also , in the low - density limit this equation does not only show a recovery of the standard general relativistic behavior , but also coincides with the dynamics of the randall - sundrum cosmology within the ads / cft duality relations .",
    "moreover , for a very large and rapidly growing value of the gauss - bonnet coefficient @xmath40 in the conformal anomaly this equation features a regime of cosmological acceleration followed by a big boost singularity . at this singularity",
    "the acceleration factor grows in finite proper time up to infinity with a finite limiting value of the hubble factor .",
    "a proper description of the late phase of this evolution , when the universe enters again a quantum phase , would require a uv completion of the low - energy semiclassical theory .",
    "a natural mechanism for a growing @xmath40 can be based on the idea of an adiabatically evolving scale associated with extra dimensions @xcite and realized within the picture of ads / cft duality , according to which a conformal field theory is induced on the 4d brane from the 5d non - conformal theory in the bulk . as is well known , this duality sheds light on the 4d general relativistic limit in the randall - sundrum model @xcite .",
    "here we observed an extended status of this duality from the cosmological perspective  the generalized randall sundrum model with the schwarzschild - ads bulk is equivalent to the anomaly driven cosmology for small energy density .",
    "in particular , the radiation content of the latter is equivalent to the dark radiation term @xmath151 pertinent to the randall - sundrum braneworld with a bulk black hole of mass @xmath227 .    another intriguing observation concerns the _ exact _ correspondence between the anomaly driven cosmology and the vacuum dgp model generalized to the case of a nonvanishing bulk cosmological constant @xmath234 . in this case",
    "a large @xmath40 is responsible for the large crossover scale @xmath236 , ( [ dgpscale ] ) . for positive @xmath234 satisfying the lower bound ( [ bound ] )",
    "this model also features a big boost scenario even for stabilized @xmath40 . below this",
    "bound ( but still for positive @xmath257 , because a negative @xmath234 would imply a time of maximal expansion from which the universe would start recollapsing ) the cosmological evolution eventually enters an eternal acceleration phase .",
    "however , the dgp model with matter on the brane can hardly be equivalent to the 4d anomaly driven cosmology , unless one has some mechanism for @xmath234 to decay and to build up matter density on the brane .",
    "unfortunately , our scenario put in the framework of the ads / cft correspondence with adiabatically evolving scale of extra dimension can not agree with the observed dark energy , because , for the required values of the parameters , the local gravitational physics of this model would become very different from the 4d general relativity .    in general",
    ", the idea of a very large central charge of cft algebra , underlying the solution of the hierarchy problem in the dark energy sector and particle phenomenology , seems hovering in current literature @xcite .",
    "our idea of a big growing @xmath40 belongs to the same scope , but its realization seems missing a phenomenologically satisfactory framework .",
    "in essence , it can be considered as an attempt to cross a canyon in two endeavors  the leap of 32 decimal orders of magnitude in @xmath183 of @xcite , separating the electroweak and planckian scales , versus our 120 orders of magnitude needed to transcend separation between the hubble and planckian scales . both look equally speculative from the viewpoint of local phenomenology",
    ".    probably some other modification of this idea can be more productive .",
    "in particular , an alternative mechanism of running @xmath40 could be based on the winding modes .",
    "these modes do not seem to play essential role in the ads / cft picture with a big scale of extra dimensions @xmath123 , because they are heavy in this limit . on the contrary , this mechanism should work in the opposite case of contracting extra dimensions , for which the restrictions from local gravitational physics do not apply ( as long as for @xmath258 the short - distance correction go deeper and deeper into uv domain ) .",
