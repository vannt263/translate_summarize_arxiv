    "in recent years , research has illuminated a link between active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and the evolution of their host galaxies .",

    "* ) . in the local universe ,",
    "high - luminosity agns are preferentially found in early - type galaxies with young mean stellar ages @xcite . as the redshift increases , the cosmic rates of both star formation and agn activity increase @xcite , and , at high redshift , intensely star - forming submillimeter galaxies have been found to have an agn fraction of @xmath620 - 30@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the connection between agns and host evolution is also observed in optical colors .",
    "studies have shown that galaxies are organized based on rest - frame color , separating into a ` red sequence ' and a ` blue cloud ' on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the sparsely populated ` green valley ' between these regions is thought to be a transitional area , where blue cloud galaxies are rapidly migrating onto the red sequence after the cessation of star formation @xcite .",
    "a proposed mechanism for this quick transition is agn feedback , where the agn activity , driven by major mergers or tidal interactions , causes a truncation of star formation and leads to the color evolution onto the red sequence @xcite .",
    "this theory is supported by a number of studies which find an association between agn activity and the green valley @xcite .",
    "however , some studies using mass - selected samples have found a more uniform color distribution of agn hosts @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have found that @xmath8of green valley agn hosts are dust - reddened members of the blue cloud , although these results are apparently in conflict with the more recent studies of @xcite .",
    "studies examining agns for recent merger activity have also found mixed results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite offer an alternative to major merger driven agns , where agns are instead triggered by minor mergers , mainly in red galaxies .",
    "star formation in this scenario would only be briefly re - ignited at the cores of many of these systems and the galaxies would return to the red sequence after its cessation .",
    "these agns would then represent a red sequence population evolving in luminosity space rather than blue cloud galaxies migrating onto the red sequence .",
    "in support of this theory , several studies have found agn activity associated with blue early - type galaxies or red galaxies with blue cores @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite propose that recycled stellar material in elliptical galaxies could fuel central starbursts and black hole accretion . without precise observations of morphologies",
    ", the effects of these two models would appear similar .",
    "other plausible models exist as well , some important only in certain regimes .",
    "for example , at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) , @xcite propose that violent disk instabilities could lead to powerful nuclear activity , while @xcite present a model where lower luminosity agns could be triggered by mild disk instabilities or gas funneled through bars .",
    "note that the properties of individual agns are widely varying , and it could be the case that any number of modes contribute to agn triggering , with different contributions in different mass and/or redshift regimes .    to better understand how agn are triggered and the role they play in galaxy evolution",
    ", it is useful to study large - scale structures ( lsss ) at high redshift .",
    "these environments contain a large number of galaxies in the process of transitioning from actively star - forming to passive , and there is evidence that nuclear activity increases at higher redshifts @xcite .    to this end",
    ", we have examined the x - ray selected agn population within five lsss at redshifts of @xmath10 - 0.9 .",
    "these structures are in varying states of evolution and include complex superclusters , an interacting supergroup , and isolated clusters .",

    "the survey has compiled extensive multi - wavelength datasets for each structure , which include multi - band optical , radio , and x - ray imaging , as well as thousands of spectroscopic redshifts @xcite .    in this paper , we present analyses of x - ray point sources and the properties of the agn population within the following five lsss : the cl1604 and cl1324 superclusters at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , the cl0023 + 0423 supergroup at @xmath14 , and two x - ray selected and relatively relaxed , isolated clusters , rxj1757.3 + 6631 at @xmath15 and rxj1821.6 + 6827 at @xmath16 .",

    "the lr is given by the equation @xmath109 here , @xmath110 is the separation between objects @xmath88 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the positional error of object @xmath111 , and @xmath113 is the inverse of the number density of optical sources with magnitude brighter than @xmath114 .",
    "the inclusion of the latter quantity is designed to weight against matching to fainter optical objects .",
    "however , in our analysis , we found that this particular weighting , used by @xcite , of @xmath115 gave too much favor to bright objects , even when they were much farther from an x - ray object than a faint source .",
    "we adjusted the weighting to @xmath116 .",
    "we found that this change did not have a large overall effect but changed some borderline cases where a bright object with a large separation from the point had been chosen over a dimmer , much closer object .",
    "this includes one case , which prompted the adjustment , where spectroscopy showed that an m - type star was matched instead of a probable agn , even though the m star was three times farther from the x - ray source .    for each field ,",
    "except cl1604 , @xmath117 was measured using @xmath43 magnitudes from our lfc catalogs . for cl1604 ,",

    "all objects were matched to the lfc catalogs .",
    "when possible , objects were also matched using the f814w magnitude from the acs catalogs and matches to acs objects took precedence over matches to lfc objects .    from the lr , we use monte carlo simulations to derive the probability that a given match is genuine .",
    "we ran 10,000 trials for each x - ray object .",
    "in each trial , the object s position was randomized , and the lr was calculated based on nearby optical sources .",
    "the lr for a given x - ray object to optical counterpart pairing , @xmath118 , was compared against the distribution of lrs from the 10,000 monte carlo trials .",
    "we calculated the reliability as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of matches , to any optical source , across all 10,000 trials for that x - ray object with lr greater than @xmath118 .",
    "@xmath121 can be interpreted as the probability that optical source @xmath88 is the true match of x - ray source @xmath111 , in the case of only one optical candidate .",
    "when there are multiple candidates , we used the method of @xcite to calculate the probability that optical source @xmath88 is the true match of x - ray source @xmath111 as @xmath122 the probability that no optical source is the true match is : @xmath123 where n is the total number of optical candidates and s is a normalization factor defined so that @xmath124 .    for an x - ray source with a single optical counterpart ,",

    "only one optical counterpart was considered for each x - ray source . in almost all cases ,",
    "the highest probability match was used . however , in several cases , spectra of the primary and secondary matches indicated that the secondary match was an agn , and thus more likely to be a genuine match .",

    "they used @xmath129 instead of 0.15 .",
    "we decided to use the more stringent threshold of 0.15 , which has been used by others @xcite , to better limit the number of false matches .",
    "the more restrictive cutoff omitted @xmath130 sources per field .",
    "we determined this threshold through visual inspection of potential matches .",
    "this calibration entailed determining at what approximate level of @xmath131 most matches visually seemed spurious .",
    "however , optical candidates above our threshold were also visually scrutinized ( @xmath132 of the total ) , and some were accepted after this inspection where we felt the matching algorithm had failed .",

    "the five structures in our sample span a range of evolutionary states .",
    "they include cl0023 , whose four constituent groups are still in the process of merging to form a single cluster ; the two isolated x - ray selected clusters , rxj1757 and rxj1821 , which appear to be in a more evolved and relaxed state ; and the two superclusters , cl1604 and cl1324 .",

    "when we examine the spatial distribution of the higher redshift peak , we find that the galaxies in its vicinity are distributed nearly uniformly across the field of view , implying a sheet of galaxies .",
    "looking at the redshift distribution of confirmed galaxies within the bounds of rxj1757 ( figure [ 1324 + 1757.rshists](d ) ) , we can see the distribution is reasonably consistent with a gaussian , confirmed by a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test at a @xmath137 level , suggesting there is no significant substructure .",
    "however , we caution that we have a smaller sample of confirmed redshifts compared to the other fields .",

    "the fit was initialized with a color range chosen `` by eye '' to conform to the apparent width of the red sequence of the structure .",
    "the magnitude bounds were defined as the range where the photometric errors were small ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "after the initial fit , colors were normalized to remove the slope .",
    "the color distribution was then fit to a single gaussian using iterative @xmath103 clipping . at the conclusion of the algorithm ,",
    "the boundaries of the red sequence were defined by a 3@xmath142offset from the center , except for cl1604 and cl1324 . for the two superclusters ,",
    "the color dispersion was inflated due to the large redshift extent of these structures , and 2@xmath30 offsets were used to achieve reasonable boundaries . for every field except cl1604 , the lfc @xmath143 color magnitude diagrams are shown .",
    "for cl1604 , acs data were available and were used in place of lfc data because of their superior precision .",
    "note , however , that two of the agns in cl1604 are outside our acs pointings , so that our analysis using acs data only includes 8 agns in the cl1604 supercluster .",

    "qualitatively , we observe a lower blue fraction in the cmds of rxj1821 and rxj1757 than in those of cl0023 and cl1604 .",
    "this is quantified in table [ bftab ] , where the blue fraction for all confirmed cluster / supercluster members with @xmath43 or f814w magnitudes brighter than 23.5 are displayed in the first column .",
    "we can see that cl0023 and cl1604 have the bluest galaxy populations , while rxj1757 has the highest fraction of galaxies on the red sequence of all the fields .",
    "since this could be due to the low completeness of spectroscopic coverage in this field , we attempted to make corrections with two approaches : ( 1 ) using our efficiency of spectroscopically confirming structure members to estimate the total number of member galaxies , and ( 2 ) correcting using measurements of the background galaxy density .",
    "all efforts to statistically estimate the true blue fraction yielded large errors making the measurements highly uncertain .",
    "instead , we created a blue fraction measurement metric that could be compared between fields ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the different fields have a varying number of spectral masks , with several different spectroscopic priorities .",
    "however , the first several masks , excluding those designed to specifically target x - ray matched sources , have similar priorities for choosing targets .",
    "therefore , we chose to compare blue fractions only among sources in the first two masks for each field , since these sources should represent similar populations .",
    "we chose two masks because this is the number of masks for rxj1757 excluding those where objects matched to x - ray point sources were preferentially targeted .",
    "we confirmed that this sampling is representative of the entire galaxy population by recreating composite spectra using only the first two spectral masks .",
    "since there are no large differences between the average spectral features , the method should be accurate .",
    "the results of this comparison are displayed in the second column of table [ bftab ] .",
    "however , we did not calculate a blue fraction for cl1604 in this way , for two reasons .",
    "first , there are a total of 24 spectroscopic masks for cl1604 , from several different telescopes . choosing which ones to include is difficult and it may be impossible to select a population congruous with any of the other fields in this manner .",
    "second , our spectroscopy for cl1604 is relatively complete , so we are confident in the blue fraction measured down to @xmath146 .    examining the results",
    ", we can see the same color hierarchy in the structures for both methods of measuring the blue fraction , with rxj1757 having the smallest fraction and cl1604 and cl0023 the largest .",
    "these large blue fractions , in particular those for cl1604 and cl0023 , are consistent with the butcher - oemler effect @xcite .",
    "we also note that the isolated x - ray - selected clusters , rxj1757 and rxj1821 , are the reddest structures , suggestive of a more advanced , dynamically relaxed evolutionary state .",
    "the color hierarchy suggests a similar ranking of galactic star formation in the five structures , which we can explore with our spectroscopic data .",

    "we formed composite spectra by co - adding the individual spectra of galaxies within each structure , according to the method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we analyze these spectra in terms of two important features relevant to star formation : the [ ]  and h@xmath2 lines .",
    "the h@xmath2 absorption is indicative of a population of a and b stars , which disappears @xmath162 gyr after the cessation of star formation within a galaxy , due to the lifetime of a stars @xcite .",
    "if star formation is ongoing , a population of o stars , which have weaker hydrogen features , can dominate the continuum and wash out this absorption line .",
    "infilling can also occur from balmer emission from regions .",
    "the [ ]  emission line has been used as an indicator of star formation , especially as a proxy for the h@xmath163 emission line at higher redshifts when h@xmath163 has shifted out of the optical range @xcite .",
    "however , recent analysis using near - ir spectroscopy of sources from the cl1604 supercluster and rxj1821 has compared [ ]  and h@xmath163 emission , finding that a significant portion of [ ]  emission can come from liner or seyfert  related processes @xcite .",
    "these results are supported by those of @xcite , albeit using a lower redshift sample . in light of this , caution must be exercised when interpreting [ ]  measurements . for an additional diagnostic ,",
    "we measure the d@xmath164(4000 ) strength which is an indicator of mean stellar age @xcite .",
    "figure [ oiivshd](a ) shows [ ]  vs.  h@xmath2 equivalent widths for the composite spectra of members of the five structures .",
    "the dotted line represents the average spectral properties for a cluster population composed of various fractions of `` normal '' star - forming and quiescent galaxies @xcite , based on data from the two - degree field ( 2df ) galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "asterisks on this line represent a cluster population composed of ( from left to right ) 20% , 40% , 60% , 80% , and 100%  star - forming galaxies . for a cluster whose average galaxy lies above this line ,",
    "the h@xmath2 line is too strong to be produced by normal star formation , requiring some contribution from starbursting or post - starbursting galaxies .",
    "the dashed lines enclose 95% of normal star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the shaded regions , which are based on the spectral types of @xcite and @xcite , denote the region of this phase space inhabited by ( starting from the upper right and moving counter - clockwise ) starburst ( dark blue ) , post - starburst ( green ) , quiescent ( red ) , and normal star - forming galaxies ( light blue ) .",
    "examining the positions of the structures in our sample on this plot , we can see that rxj1757 and rxj1821 have mostly quiescent populations , with each cluster having @xmath165 normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "because rxj1757 is offset from the 2df line , there may be some contribution from post - starburst galaxies , but the fractional contribution is low .",
    "the stronger [ ]  emission in the cl0023 and cl1604 composite spectra suggests that these structures have a higher fraction ( @xmath166 ) of continuously star - forming galaxies .",
    "these structures have larger blue fractions than the others , so it is unlikely that the increased ew ( [ ] ) in their average spectra is due to liner processes , which are primarily associated with red sequence galaxies .",
    "the ew(h@xmath2 ) measured from the cl0023 and cl1604 composite spectra are significantly in excess of the 2df line , suggesting a substantial contribution from starbursting or post - starburst galaxies .",
    "cl1324 is in an intermediate range , with @xmath167 normal star - forming galaxies and an observed ew(h@xmath2 ) for its galaxy population smaller than that of cl0023 and cl1604 .",
    "our conclusions based on the [ ]  and h@xmath2 lines are supported by the corresponding d@xmath164(4000 ) measurements ( see table [ globchartab ] ) .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ oiivshd](b ) , where average measurements of ew(h@xmath2 ) and d@xmath164(4000 ) are plotted for the five structures .",
    "for comparison , we also indicate ranges of ew(h@xmath2)d@xmath164(4000 ) phase space spanned by four different bruzual & charlot @xcite models for various times after the starburst .",
    "the four models include a single burst ( @xmath168 ) and a secondary burst of 20% , 10% , and 5% by mass which occurs 2 gyr after the initial burst .",
    "all models are solar metallicity and are corrected for extinction using e(b - v ) @xmath169 and a @xcite extinction law .",
    "because bruzual & charlot models only incorporate stellar light , emission infill corrections were made for all ew(h@xmath2 ) measurements using relationships between h@xmath163 and [ ]  taken from @xcite and h@xmath163 and h@xmath2 from @xcite .",
    "although these corrections are not perfect ( e.g. , see the measurement for region 1 ) , these values should be accurate to within @xmath170  .",
    "we can see that rxj1757 and rxj1821 have the largest continuum break strengths , indicating that they possess the oldest average stellar populations of the five structures .",
    "the average galaxy in this structure has had 1 - 3 gyr since its last starburst , according to the @xcite model .",
    "the other structures have smaller average d@xmath164(4000 ) measurements , consistent with the results of figure [ oiivshd](a ) showing larger fractions of star - forming galaxies and younger galaxy populations . according to the @xcite model",
    ", the average galaxy in cl1324 , cl0023 , and cl1604 has had a progressively shorter time since the last starburst .",
    "altogether , these spectral results parallel what was found with the blue fractions , in that the reddest structures are also the ones with the most evolved stellar populations and the lowest fraction of star - forming galaxies .      despite our extensive spectroscopic sample , there are too few x - ray agns in any individual cluster ( and even supercluster ) to draw statistical conclusions .",
    "hence , we divide our structure sample into two categories .",
    "the first contains cl0023 and cl1604 which have the highest level of ongoing star formation and starburst activity , as shown in the preceding sections .",
    "the second category , consisting of cl1324 , rxj1757 , and rxj1821 , contains structures whose member galaxies are typically quiescent or forming stars at a lower rate .",
    "we refer to these two categories as `` unevolved '' and `` evolved '' , respectively , as a means of describing their typical galaxy populations .",
    "while we acknowledge that the terms `` more evolved '' and `` less evolved '' would be more appropriate , we adopt the less accurate denominations for brevity .",
    "in addition , these terms do not necessarily imply differing levels of cluster dynamical evolution or even a clear temporal sequence from one category to the other .",
    "we note that , while some clusters or groups may not fit well with the global characteristics of their parent supercluster ( i.e. cluster a of cl1604 ) , we can not examine all of the agns on a cluster - by - cluster basis . as we will discuss in section [ sec : spatdist ] , many of the agns in the superclusters and the supergroup are not associated with any one cluster or group .",
    "so , when analyzing these agns , we take the parent supercluster or supergroup as a whole .",
    "the particular segregation of our structure sample is motivated by the clear distinction between the structures shown in figure [ oiivshd ] .",
    "the abundant star formation in the unevolved structures suggests the presence of a large gas reservoir in many of their member galaxies . we might expect that this same gas is available for agn fueling",
    "conversely , the typical galaxy in the evolved sample has likely consumed most of the available gas in prior star formation episodes , leaving less fuel for the agns . in the following sections , we examine whether the properties of the agn sin the two categories",
    "reflects this distinction , and what we can can learn about the relationship of star formation to agn activity in lsss .",
    "in this section , we examine the frequency of agn activity within the five structures to determine if there are associated excesses of x - ray point sources .",
    "x - ray point source photometry was used to calculate cumulative x - ray source number counts , @xmath171 , using the method of @xcite : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the number of point sources with fluxes greater than @xmath174 and @xmath175 is the area of the sky in which the _ i_th point source could have been detected at a 3@xmath30 level or higher .",

    "these results are consistent with previous work studying the spatial distribution of agns , in that the agns tend to be located outside of clusters or in their outskirts .",
    "first , the distribution of agns in cl1604 , previously studied by @xcite , is consistent with the other four structures here .",
    "our results are also consistent with those of @xcite , who found that agns in the a901/902 supercluster at @xmath210 tend to avoid the densest areas .",
    "several other studies have also found that x - ray agns tend to reside in regions of moderate density similar to group environments , up to @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "it is thought that regions of intermediate density , such as the outskirts of clusters , are the most conducive to galaxy - galaxy interactions because of the elevated densities , compared to the field , but relatively low velocities @xcite .",
    "since we find more of the agns in these areas , this lends support to the theory that mergers or tidal interactions are one of the main instigators of agn activity . since only @xmath212",
    "inhabit dense cluster cores , processes which preferentially occur in these regions , such as ram pressure stripping , are probably not responsible for triggering agns in cluster galaxies .",
    "however , the association between agns and these regions could also be related to higher gas availability in galaxies farther from cluster cores .",
    "although we find that most of the x - ray agns do not reside in the cluster cores , a number of studies have measured the fraction of cluster galaxies that host agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we attempt to measure the agn fraction for the individual clusters within the five structures in our sample . because we are limited by the spectral completeness of our sample ,",

    "we compare to the results of @xcite for low - redshift clusters ( @xmath213 ) , who used galaxies with @xmath214 , within approximately 2000 km  s@xmath5  of the mean redshift of cluster members for each system , and within the field of view of their _ chandra _ observations , which ranged from 1.2 to 4.5 mpc in width . to approximate these criteria ,",
    "we adopt a magnitude cutoff that roughly corresponds to @xmath215 and use galaxies within 1 mpc and @xmath216 of the cluster centers and redshifts .",

    "this incompleteness contributes the largest source of error to our measurement . because of the large uncertainties , we refrain from drawing any conclusions from our measurement .",
    "figure [ cmds ] presents cmds , which are described in section [ sec : globchar ] , for all five fields .",
    "confirmed agn members of the structures are shown with blue squares .",
    "while the agns in cl1324 , rxj1821 , and rxj1757 preferentially reside within the bounds of , or very close to , the red sequence , the agn hosts in cl0023 and cl1604 are more spread out .",
    "previous work , including @xcite and a number of wide - field surveys @xcite , has found an association between agn activity in galaxies and the transition onto the red sequence ( possibly for a second time ) in the green valley .",
    "while these galaxies could be evolving from the blue cloud onto the red sequence , it is also possible that they could have moved down off the red sequence after a tidal interaction or merger and are evolving back @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that some studies using mass - selected samples have found that agn hosts have a color distribution more similar to that of normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite , using a sample of galaxies with redshifts @xmath219 , have found that many green valley agn hosts are dust - reddened blue cloud members , so that agn host colors acquire the bimodality apparent in the general galaxy population .",
    "however , @xcite have also examined the impact of extinction on the colors of agn hosts and did not find a significant impact for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath219 , although bimodality may be introduced at higher redshifts . to address this issue for our study , we are planning to implement spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting to evaluate the impact of extinction on the broadband colors of our sample .",
    "preliminary results from sed fitting of the cl1604 hosts suggest that extinction levels in our sample are not as drastic as those presented by @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that agn host colors are contaminated by the agns themselves .",
    "however , this is unlikely because ( 1 ) almost all agn hosts in our sample have rest - frame x - ray luminosities below the quasi - stellar object ( qso ) level of @xmath220 erg s@xmath5 ( see sec [ sec : xlum ] ) and ( 2 ) @xcite found that , in cl1604 , agn hosts with blue cores did not have a rising blue continuum indicative of qso activity .",
    "therefore , we proceed to investigate the agn association with the transition zone and to explore differences in the evolutionary states of their host galaxies in each field by examining color offsets of the agn hosts from the red sequence .",
    "histograms of offsets from the center of the red sequence are shown in figure [ rsoffsets ] .",
    "the first two panels present offsets in terms of color .",
    "in the top panel , only the structures where lfc data were used are shown , which is every field except cl1604 .",

    "will then be located between -1.0 and 1.0 .    with red sequence offsets",
    ", we can quantitatively examine the green valley . in figure [ rsoffsets](b ) , we plot a histogram of rs offsets , measured from the acs data , for the agns in the cl1604 supercluster . for comparison , we overplot a scaled distribution of rs offsets for all spectroscopically confirmed supercluster members with acs photometry . in the scaled histogram , we can clearly see an area of reduced number density between the red sequence and blue cloud . for cl1604",
    ", the green valley can be approximated as the region @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the offset of an agn host from the center of the red sequence . only @xmath224of all confirmed supercluster members with acs data fall within this region .",
    "however , five out of eight of the cl1604 agn hosts with acs data reside within it .",
    "while it is unclear how well this definition of the green valley extends to lfc data , because of larger photometric errors , we can see in figure [ rsoffsets]c that @xmath1 of all host galaxies have @xmath225 and @xmath226 are in the range @xmath227 .    while many galaxies in both the evolved and unevolved structures lie in the ` green valley ' region , the percentage of agns on the red sequence is somewhat higher in the evolved structures compared to the unevolved structures , with 30@xmath7 and @xmath177 , respectively . examining figure",
    "[ rsoffsets ] , we can see the distribution of agn hosts in evolved structures is clustered closer to the red sequence , while in the unevolved structures , this distribution has a large tail extending into the blue cloud .",
    "indeed , none of the agn host galaxies in the evolved structures have @xmath228c @xmath229 , whereas four of the x - ray agn hosts in the unevolved structures have red - sequence offsets below this limit .",
    "although these results are suggestive ( and unaffected by our inclusion of the @xmath205 3@xmath30 x - ray sources ) , the two distributions are not statistically different based on the k - s test .    morphological analysis by @xcite has shown that @xmath230 of the x - ray agns in cl1604 have had recent mergers or tidal interactions , which could fuel star formation through starburst events .",
    "more recent mergers or interactions are one possible explanation for some of the color differences that we see between the agn host galaxies in the evolved and unevolved structures .",
    "in particular , we find that nine of the agn host galaxies are members of a kinematic close pair with a relative line - of - sight velocity of @xmath231 km s@xmath5 and projected physical separation ( on the plane of the sky ) of @xmath232 h@xmath233 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "two are in cl0023 , five in cl1604 , one in cl1324 , and one in rxj1821 ( see table [ agntab ] ) .",
    "those agn hosts in pairs include three out of the four galaxies with the largest red sequence offsets ( i.e. , the bluest ) , all of which are members of the unevolved structures . based on their @xmath63 magnitudes or measured stellar masses ( in the case of the cl1604 members ; see @xcite ) , seven out of the nine kinematic pairs have flux or mass ratios of @xmath234 , implying a major merger scenario .    the differences in color and , perhaps , merger activity are likely related to the increased level of star formation and starburst activity in the unevolved compared to evolved structures ( see section [ sec : specprop ] ) . to explore the connection between the agn and star formation history",
    ", we can use our high - resolution spectroscopy to examine the average spectral properties of their host galaxies .",
    "we measure the average spectral properties of the agn host galaxies in the five orelse structures using three composite spectra : one comprised of six agns from cl0023 km  s@xmath5 ) which would dominate a composite spectrum and was therefore not included .",
    "while the other has a very broad line , the other features are narrow and do not dominate the composite spectrum . as a result , it was included .",
    "] , one comprised of all ten agns from cl1604 , and one comprised of the ten agns from the combined fields of cl1324 , rxj1821 , and rxj1757 .",
    "the last spectrum combines all the evolved structures , necessitated by the low number of agns in rxj1821 and rxj1757 compared with the other structures .",
    "these three composite spectra are shown in figure [ csplot ] , and measurements of spectral features are listed in table [ co - addtab ] .    first , we can see that the agn hosts in all three groupings have substantial [ ]  emission . in cl1604 and the evolved structures ,",
    "most of this emission is probably from the agns , rather than star formation .",
    "six of the ten agn host galaxies in our cl1604 sample were analyzed by @xcite using the keck ii near - infrared echelle spectrograph ( nirspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for five out of the six targets",
    ", @xcite found that the [ ] /h@xmath163 flux ratio was too large for a normal star - forming galaxy , which implies that agns are the dominant contributor to [ ]  emission @xcite .",
    "the cl1324 , rxj1821 , and rxj1757 structures have agns mostly near or on the red sequence .",
    "in addition , we found in section [ sec : globchar ] that star formation is low in all three structures ( @xmath235of all galaxies are star - forming ) .",
    "because of this low star formation rate , and because @xcite found that @xmath236 of red [ ]  emitters are dominated by liner / seyfert emission , it is likely that most of the [ ]  emission from the agn host galaxies in the evolved structures comes from the agns as well .",
    "deciphering the origin of the [ ]  emission in the agn host galaxies in cl0023 is not as straightforward . while some agn host galaxies in cl0023 are on the red sequence , the structure also has the bluest host galaxies in our sample",
    "also , as discussed in section [ sec : globchar ] , there is significant star formation in the general population of cl0023 .",
    "while this is also true of cl1604 , the nirspec results of @xcite showed most of the [ ]  emission in the agn host galaxies in that structure comes from the agns .",
    "however , we do not have any near - ir spectroscopic data for the cl0023 agns , so we must use other means to determine the emission source . the average [ ] / [ ]  ratio of the cl0023 x - ray agn hosts is 0.429 , typical of type-2 agn emission , emission from metal - poor star formation , or a superposition of the two processes @xcite .",
    "note that cl1604 and the evolved structures have values of the [ ] / [ ]  ratio of 0.549 and 0.229 , respectively , also typical of type-2 agn emission . combining this result with the blue colors of the cl0023 hosts and the high fraction of star - forming galaxies , it is likely that the observed [ ]  emission of the agn hosts in cl0023 is due to a combination of normal star formation and type-2 agn activity .",
    "examination of the balmer features reveals further insight into the star formation histories of the agn host galaxies .",
    "specifically , based on a single stellar population model , the ew(h@xmath2 ) rises quickly from zero after a starburst in a galaxy , peaks after about 300500 myr , and then declines back to approximately zero at @xmath3 gyr after the burst @xcite .",
    "infill can complicate the interpretation of this feature , so care must be taken when measuring the line strength . for the composite spectrum of the cl0023 agn hosts ,",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath2 , attempting to correct for infill , is consistent with zero .",
    "however , we observe strong emission from other balmer features , ew@xmath237 line , figure [ csplot ] was not drawn out to this range . however , approximately two - thirds of agns in the cl0023 structure do have spectral coverage for h@xmath238 , and the measurement presented here represents the average value for these galaxies . ] and ew@xmath239 , suggesting that emission infill has a significant effect on the measured ew(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "this infill could be due to emission from regions , emission from agns or some other liner processes , or from continuum emission produced by o stars .",
    "since we observe h@xmath238 and h@xmath240 in emission , it is unlikely that o stars are solely responsible for the observed ew(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "the balmer emission lines observed in the cl0023 agn hosts are not broadkm  s@xmath5 . ] and are quite strong . in the average type-2 agn , a large fraction of the balmer emission originates from star formation @xcite , which suggests ongoing star formation in the cl0023 hosts .",
    "compared to cl0023 , h@xmath240 emission from the cl1604 hosts is low , with ew(h@xmath240 ) = -0.69@xmath241 , which is consistent with a lower level of star formation in the supercluster ) could not be measured for a majority of galaxies in the cl1604 host sample . ] .",

    "these results combined with the earlier result analyzing the average [ ] / [ ]  ratios of the agn hosts strongly indicates that star formation is occurring in the cl0023 galaxies coevally with agn activity , while less star formation activity is occuring in the other structures .",

    "larger values of d@xmath164(4000 ) indicate a more passive galaxy , with an older average stellar population , which could mean that more time has passed since the cessation of star formation @xcite .",
    "the ew(h@xmath2 ) measured from the cl1604 composite is @xmath256 , roughly half of that from the evolved structures composite .",
    "similarly , the cl1604 composite has a lower value for d@xmath164(4000 ) than those in the evolved structures , indicating that the average cl1604 host is more actively star - forming or has a younger stellar population on average .",
    "this result is supported by the bluer colors of the cl1604 agn hosts compared to those in the evolved structures .",
    "all of these results imply the average cl1604 host has had a starburst more recently than the average agn host in the evolved structures .",
    "the agn host composite spectra for cl0023 has a particularly low d@xmath164(4000 ) measurement ( see table [ co - addtab ] ) . since we found that this composite spectra ( which excluded one broadline source ) was consistent with type-2 agns , the agns themselves should not contribute most of the blue continuum .",
    "this points to a stellar source , particulary o and b stars .",
    "we would then expect significant star formation in the cl0023 hosts within the last 10 - 100 myr , as indicated by the other spectral features as well .",

    "we do see a decrease in the overall strengths of both lines in the average spectrum of the cl0023 host galaxies relative to the other structures ; however , we actually measure a dramatic decrease in the ratio for cl0023 ( @xmath247 ) , the opposite of what is expected from a population of a and b stars .",
    "the most likely explanation is significant h@xmath257 emission , which would be in concert with the other observed balmer emission .",
    "the h@xmath257 emission could be coming from some combination of agns and regions , which would support previous conclusions about the level of activity in the cl0023 hosts .    altogether ,",

    "these differences suggest a progression in the temporal proximity of the last starburst event , with the hosts in cl0023 having significant ongoing star formation characteristic of a current starburst , to those in cl1604 and the evolved structures each having successively more time since the last significant starburst event . we have confirmed that none of our results based on the composite spectra are changed by removing the four lowest significance ( @xmath2053 @xmath30 ) x - ray sources from our sample , with most spectral measurements remaining the same within the errors .    with our analysis of the composite spectra of agn host galaxies in the different structures",

    "in contrast , the populations in the unevolved structures were comprised of large fractions of star - forming galaxies , with a more significant contribution from starburst or post - starburst galaxies . when comparing these results to the average spectral properties of the agn hosts , we find that , in _ all _ cases , the average agn host galaxy has a _ younger _ stellar population than the average galaxy in the parent structure , irregardless of the evolved or unevolved classification .",
    "this result holds even when comparing to member galaxies outside the dense cluster cores ( @xmath258mpc ) , where the vast majority of x - ray agns reside .",
    "the most prominent difference comes from the evolved structures where their average agn host galaxy has significantly larger ew(h@xmath2 ) and smaller d@xmath164(4000 ) than the average structure member , indicative of a post - starburst galaxy with a substantial star - formation event within the last @xmath259gyr .",

    "while we do observe clear differences between the spectra of the agn hosts , with those in cl0023 having significant ongoing star formation to those in the evolved structures having the most time since the last significant starburst event , these differences are not nearly as pronounced as the differences between the average galaxy in each structure .",
    "this suggests that agn activity has a common origin associated with current or recent star - formation .      in this section",
    ", we explore the differences between the structures and agn host properties based on the x - ray luminosities of the confirmed agns .",
    "we calculate rest - frame luminosities for x - ray point sources with known redshifts .",
    "k - corrections were carried out using the power law spectral models for sources , with a photon index of @xmath260 , described in section [ sec : red ] .",
    "luminosities are measured in the x - ray soft , hard , and full bands .",
    "a histogram of full - band rest - frame luminosity , binned by evolved and unevolved structures , is shown in figure [ xlums ] .",
    "the luminosity distributions in the soft and hard bands are similar to the one shown .    in the left panel of figure [ xlums ] , we can see that the agns in the unevolved structures have higher x - ray luminosities than those in the more evolved structures .",
    "k - s tests show that the distributions of the two bins are different at the 99@xmath7 level in each of the three bands .",
    "this statistically - significant result is independent of our inclusion of the four low - significance ( @xmath205 3@xmath30 ) x - ray sources .",
    "while 10 out of 17 agns in the unevolved structures have full band luminosities above @xmath261 ergs s@xmath5 , there are _ no _ agns above this limit in cl1324 , rxj1757 , or rxj1821 .",
    "we follow a bayesian approach , using poisson statistics to calculate the likelihoods , to estimate the probability of finding no high @xmath262 agns in the evolved structures ( @xmath263 ) given the detection rate in the unevolved structures . specifically , we calculate @xmath264 . here , @xmath265 is the number of high @xmath266 agns that are spectroscopically confirmed members in the unevolved structures , and @xmath267 and @xmath268 are the total number of high @xmath266 agns that were targeted for spectroscopy in the unevolved and evolved structures , respectively .",
    "based on this calculation , the probability of finding no high @xmath262 agns in the evolved structures is only 0.25% .",
    "this result is likely related to the smaller fractions of blue cloud galaxies ( and overall more quiescent populations ) in cl1324 , rxj1757 , or rxj1821 and , thus , the unavailability of large gas reservoirs .    at the faint end , there are four sources in the evolved structures below @xmath269 ergs s@xmath5 , all of which are members of cl1324 . however , the x - ray source counts , in all five fields , are significantly incomplete at these luminosity levels with only @xmath270 of optically matched x - ray sources below this limit , most of which are @xmath205 3@xmath30 detections",
    ". therefore , we can not say anything definitive about the lack of faint sources in the unevolved structures ; however , if we remove the four low - luminosity sources , the difference between the luminosity distributions in the evolved and unevolved samples is still significant at a 95% level according to the k - s test .",
    "the reasonably high significance is clearly due to the lack of high - luminosity sources in the evolved structures .      in the right panel of figure [ xlums ]",
    ", we plot the full - band rest - frame luminosity versus the red - sequence offset , scaled by rs width ( see section [ sec : hgalcolan ] ) . from this figure",
    ", we can see that all agns with host galaxies on the red - sequence have lower x - ray luminosities , all below @xmath271 ergs s@xmath5 ( region 4 ) .",
    "this result is not unexpected since agn activity should diminish as the host galaxy moves onto the red sequence .",
    "we can also see that 60% of the confirmed agns lie in the green valley ( @xmath272 ; regions 2 and 3 ) .",
    "most interestingly , in the green valley there are almost two orders of magnitude variation in x - ray luminosity , with the unevolved structures having all of the highest @xmath273 sources .",

    "we also do not detect any low @xmath266 blue agns ( region 5 ) or any high @xmath266 red agns ( region 6 ) , not necessarily unexpected given their expected gas contents .",
    "however , it is difficult to say for certain if these null results are significant .",
    "we do sample optically matched x - ray sources in these regions .",
    "specifically , in the five fields , there are a total of 85 sources ( at @xmath133 3@xmath30 ) in region 5 ( @xmath274 and @xmath275 ergs s@xmath5 ) , of which we have targeted 24 ( 28% ) . here",
    ", we estimate the x - ray luminosities by assuming that all sources in a particular field are at the mean redshift of the structure , and we choose the lower limit of @xmath276 ergs s@xmath5 so as not to be adversely affected by incompleteness ( see above ) .",
    "based on @xcite , the x - ray luminosity function of field agns at similar redshifts in `` optically normal '' galaxies ( comparable to the vast majority of our agn hosts ) shows increasing number densities down to @xmath277 ergs s@xmath5 . as a result",
    ", we would naively expect to detect a larger number of fainter x - ray sources in the blue cloud . using the bayesian approach described in section [ sec : xlum ] ,",
    "the probability of finding no agn in region 5 is 3% , given our success rate of confirming cluster members for the high @xmath266 blue galaxies ( region 1 ) .",
    "this formal probability may , in fact , be an _",
    "upper limit _ as we would expect a higher success rate given the larger number densities at fainter x - ray luminosities .",
    "the fact that we observe no low @xmath266 blue galaxies in our sample may suggest that , in high - density environments compared to the field , either ( 1 ) the time to reach the highest x - ray luminosities is shorter after agn turn - on or ( 2 ) the host galaxies are transformed more quickly , moving to redder colors by the time their x - ray luminosities drop to lower levels .",
    "similarly , there are 25 sources in region 6 ( @xmath278 and @xmath279 ergs s@xmath5 ) , of which we have targeted 7 ( 28% ) . if we assume our success rate for confirming cluster members as measured from all high @xmath266 agns ( regions 1 and 2 ) , the probability of finding no agn in region 6 is 18% . although not a significant result , the conclusions for this region are , of course , more obvious as we do not expect any true red - sequence ( i.e. , non - dust reddened ) galaxies to have enough cold gas to fuel a luminous agn .      to explore the origin of the variations observed in figure [ xlums ] , we examine the average spectral properties of the host galaxies within the four distinct regions .",
    "specifically , the sample is split by x - ray luminosity at @xmath280 and red - sequence offset , scaled by rs width , to delineate regions containing high @xmath266 blue cloud ( region 1 ) , high @xmath266 ( region 2 ) and low @xmath266 ( region 3 ) green valley , and low @xmath266 red - sequence ( region 4 ) host galaxies . in figure [ specreg ] , we plot the measured ew(h@xmath2 ) versus d@xmath164(4000 ) from the spectral composites in the four regions . for comparison",
    ", we also plot post - starburst temporal regimes derived from four @xcite models , described in section [ sec : specprop ] .",
    "the small d@xmath281(4000 ) and h@xmath2 in emission indicate that the high @xmath266 blue hosts are coeval with the starburst or ongoing star formation . as we examine galaxies in regions 2 to 4 going from the high to low @xmath266 hosts in the green valley to the low @xmath266 hosts in the red sequence , the time since the burst gets progressively larger .",
    "while there is some degeneracy between time since burst and burst strength , it is clear that the low @xmath266 green valley hosts are either ( 1 ) further along since the burst than their high @xmath266 counterparts or ( 2 ) had a weaker initial burst which could explain their lower x - ray luminosities as less gas would likely be funneled to the center .",
    "our results are robust to removing the four lowest significance ( @xmath205 3@xmath30 ) x - ray sources , as well as the four x - ray sources below @xmath276 ergs s@xmath5 , where in both cases we are highly incomplete .",
    "the most striking results from this spectral analysis are , first , that the average agn host in _ every _ region is either in the process of having a starburst or has had one within last @xmath282 gyr .",
    "this global finding clearly demonstrates the close connection between starburst and agn activity as normal star formation does not typically produce the h@xmath2 values seen in these host galaxies .",
    "second , we do not detect high x - ray luminosity , young ( as indicated by time since starburst ) galaxies in the evolved structures .",
    "this result implies that the entire galaxy population in these structures ( certainly in the isolated , x - ray selected ones ) are more advanced , suggesting that the peak of gas consumption , seen in both star formation and agn activity , occurred at an earlier time .",
    "we studied agn activity in five high - redshift clusters and superclusters in the redshift range @xmath283 . before identifying individual agns",
    ", we analyzed the structures using the statistical measure of cumulative source counts .",
    "we found every structure to have x - ray excesses of 0.5 - 1.5 @xmath30 with respect to the cdfn and cdfs control fields .",

    "these results show that significant spectroscopy is needed to confirm even small numbers of agn members .",
    "we find that the spatial distribution of the agn is largely consistent with previous work at lower redshift . across all five structures",

    "previous studies have found similar results up to @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "these intermediate environments are thought to be conducive to galaxy - galaxy interactions , because of the relatively high densities compared to the field and low velocity dispersions compared to cluster cores @xcite .",
    "our results would then lend support to these interactions as the trigger of x - ray agn activity in the environments of lsss . however , these may also be regions where gas availability is higher in the member galaxies , which could lead to increased agn activity",
    ".    with optical counterparts to x - ray sources identified , we were able to analyze the color properties of agn hosts .",
    "our analysis showed that agn host galaxies are overrepresented in the green valley . in cl1604 , only @xmath286 of all the supercluster members with acs data were within @xmath287 of the lower boundary of the red sequence , where @xmath221 is the width of the red sequence , defined in section [ sec : globchar ] .",
    "however , five out of the eight agn hosts in our acs pointings were in this range .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 of host galaxies in all five structures lie within @xmath221 of the lower boundary of the red sequence and @xmath226 are within @xmath287 .",
    "our results are supported by other studies which have found an overabundance of agn activity in the green valley @xcite .",
    "since the green valley is thought to be a transitional region for galaxies @xcite , these results suggest x - ray agns in lss are a transitional population between blue star - forming and red quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , we note that , while our sample is magnitude - limited , several studies using mass - selected samples have found less overrepresentation of agn hosts in the green valley @xcite .",

    "this distinction is based on the average stellar populations and the presence , or lack thereof , of current star formation . with these two categories",
    ", we sought to explore differences in agn activity between structures with different galaxy populations .",
    "we did not find any significant differences between the five structures when examining the cumulative source counts or the spatial distributions of the agn hosts .",
    "however , the agn host galaxies in the unevolved structures were skewed more towards bluer colors , although this was not at a statistically significant level for this sample size .",
    "we did , however , find significant differences between the subsets when examining the x - ray luminosities of the agns and the optical spectra of their hosts .",
    "we found that agns in the unevolved structures tend to have higher full band ( 0.58 kev ) x - ray luminosities relative to those in the evolved structures at a @xmath137 level , with all of the most luminous agns ( @xmath279 erg s@xmath5 ) found in the unevolved structures . while _ all _ agn host galaxies either have on - going star formation or have had a starburst within the last @xmath282 gyr , the host galaxies in the unevolved structures are distinctly younger than those in the evolved structures , with shorter times since the last starburst as indicated by smaller average ew@xmath288 and d@xmath164(4000 ) in their composite spectra .",
    "the average cl0023 host has current star formation , and the average cl1604 host has had a burst within the last @xmath289 myr .",
    "we do not detect any of these young , high x - ray luminosity agns in the evolved structures , implying that the peak of both star formation and agn activity occurred at an earlier time .",
    "we note that , regardless of whether they are members of the evolved or unevolved structures , _ all _ agn host galaxies are younger than the average galaxy in their parent population .",
    "we also find a large ( two orders of magnitude ) variation in x - ray luminosity for agns within the green valley , while agns in the red sequence have consistently lower luminosities ( @xmath271 erg s@xmath5 ) .",
    "as we move from the high to low @xmath266 green - valley hosts to low @xmath266 red - sequence hosts , the time since starburst gets progressively longer .",
    "although there is some degeneracy between burst strength and time since burst , the low @xmath266 green valley hosts are either further along since the burst than their high @xmath266 counterparts or have had a weaker initial burst , which may explain their lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "the higher agn x - ray luminosities in the unevolved structures are most likely related to their bluer colors and , hence , larger reservoirs of gas that could lead to higher levels of black hole accretion and the higher x - ray luminosities . in addition , both the x - ray and spectral results can be explained if these galaxies had more recently undergone merger - induced , or other , starburst events .",
    "specifically , simulations and observations have found that agn activity peaks soon after maximum star formation in a starburst event ( @xmath60.1 - 0.25 gyr ) @xcite .",
    "as the agn x - ray luminosity declines after reaching its peak , the star formation rate should be declining as well .",
    "this could explain why the most x - ray luminous agns are in the least evolved structures .",
    "agn host galaxies in cl0023 were also found to have significant ongoing star formation , which could mean these galaxies have had the most recent merger events , where star formation is still near its peak .",
    "the x - ray luminosity differences between the agns in the evolved and unevolved structures could also be viewed as a transition from quasar mode emission towards radio mode emission , as defined in @xcite and @xcite , which is also related to the star formation rate .",
    "since agn feedback deters gas from falling into the core and depletes the cold gas in a galaxy , the fuel for both star formation and further agn emission is decreased .",
    "ultimately , the dominant fuel for black hole accretion transitions from cold gas funneled to the galactic core from the starburst event to hot halo gas , which leads to a much more quiescent state ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; for a similar model , see also , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in our sample",
    ", the cl0023 agns are emitting more similarly to the quasar mode , accompanied by substantial star formation .",
    "the agn host galaxies in cl1604 and the evolved structures have lower star formation rates than those in cl0023 , while the evolved structures have agns with lower x - ray luminosities , which suggests that they are sequentially further along the track leading toward domination of radio mode agn emission .",
    "if the agns in the evolved structures were found to be radio emitters , it would support these conclusions .",
    "existing vla b - array observations ( at 1.4 ghz ) of these five structures are currently being analyzed to explore this connection ( c. d. fassnacht et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .    altogether",
    ", many of our results could support several potential agn triggering scenarios .",
    "two possibilities are that : ( 1 ) agns in these structures represent a transitional population where hosts are evolving from the blue cloud onto the red sequence or ( 2 ) agns represent a population evolving mainly in mass space , where red sequence hosts have undergone episodic nuclear star formation induced by minor mergers .",
    "additionally , many observable effects of the latter would appear similar to models in which recycled stellar material fuels central starbursts and nuclear activity in elliptical galaxies , which tend to be located on the red sequence .",
    "in the first case , agns are triggered by mergers or strong tidal interactions which lead to a starburst .",
    "the feedback from the agn quenches star formation , leading to a rapid evolution across the green valley and onto the red sequence @xcite . in the second case ,",
    "red sequence galaxies undergo minor mergers , which funnel gas into the galactic core , creating a burst of nuclear star formation and fueling the agn @xcite .",
    "alternatively , recycled stellar material could create a nuclear starburst and a central instability , leading to black hole accretion @xcite . in either case",
    ", the galaxies could evolve into the green valley before agn feedback brought them onto the red sequence again .",
    "once on the red sequence , there would not be a large net change in color , in contrast to the dramatic color evoltion of the first possibility . in the case of minor mergers ,",
    "this process would mainly entail an evolution in mass .    in support of agns as a transitional population , many of the host galaxies across all five structures",
    "are located close to the red sequence , where the green valley should lie , although it is difficult to determine the location of the green valley in the four structures without precise acs data . in support of all scenarios involving significant starbursts ,",
    "the average agn host in both the evolved structures and the cl1604 supercluster has substantial h@xmath2 absorption , which is a sign of recently quenched star formation .",
    "this is expected for green valley galaxies evolving onto the red sequence .",
    "previous morphological analysis of part of our sample by @xcite found that two - thirds of cl1604 host galaxies studied showed signs of recent or pending mergers or tidal interactions , which is expected in the context of both major and minor merger theories .",
    "in addition , we find that at least nine of the 27 agn host galaxies are part of a kinematic close pair . in seven of these cases ,",
    "the companion galaxy has a similar stellar mass or @xmath63 magnitude to the agn host . while being far from conclusive due to sampling and selection effects , these results could point to a major merger scenario .",
    "@xcite examined eight of the agns in cl1604 and found that half of the hosts had blue cores in an otherwise red galaxy .",
    "other studies have also found blue cores or blue early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "these blue cores are predicted by minor merger simulations @xcite , as well as the recycled gas models of @xcite .",
    "in addition simulations show that central black hole accretion is most highly correlated with star formation in the nucleus , as opposed to the entire galaxy @xcite . during a major merger ,",
    "star formation peaks at later times closer to the galactic core @xcite .",
    "this could potentially create bluer cores as well . from our data",
    ", it seems our results are ambiguous with regards to the various scenarios .",
    "however , with evidence supporting more than one possibility , our results could indicate a combination of different triggering mechanisms .",
    "these different agn triggering mechanisms could also potentially explain some of the differences that we see between the evolved and unevolved structures . the second agn mode , involving episodic nuclear activity in red sequence galaxies fueled by minor mergers , or recycled gas , is expected to involve accretion rates at a much lower eddington ratio than in major merger driven agn activity @xcite .",
    "while agn luminosity depends on both the eddington ratio and the black hole mass @xcite , lower eddington ratios will , on average , correspond to lower luminosities .",
    "a difference in eddington ratios could potentially explain the lower x - ray luminosities that we observe in the evolved structures , if our sample of host galaxies consists of a mix of the two agn modes .",
    "in the unevolved structures , we would expect to observe more major mergers between blue cloud galaxies due to the larger fraction of blue galaxies , fueling the brightest agns in our sample .",
    "since all of our structures have a substantial number of red - sequence galaxies we would expect all structures to have galaxies undergoing the second mode of agn activity , whether induced by minor mergers or , perhaps , recycled gas in ellipticals .",
    "we would then expect the x - ray luminosity distributions of the evolved and unevolved structures to look similar except for a tail of higher luminosity objects in the unevolved structures , which is roughly what we observe . while a combination of the two agn modes considered could explain our results , they could also be explained if major mergers were the primary driver , and the quasar mode is less dominant for the agns in the evolved structures , because of the larger red fraction therein . with our current data",
    ", we still lack the ability to distinguish between the different triggering mechanisms .",
    "breaking the degeneracy will require high - resolution imaging to examine the morphologies of the agn hosts and the colors of their cores in the structures other than cl1604 , as well as reliable stellar masses and hst data , for measuring bulge - to - disk - ratios , with which we could reliably calculate eddington ratios .",
    "in summary , we find that most x - ray agn hosts , across all five structures , avoid the dense cluster cores , in agreement with a number of previous studies at a range of redshifts . we interpret this to mean that x - ray agn activity is preferentially triggered in intermediate - density environments , such as the outskirts of clusters .",
    "we also find many agn host galaxies in or near the green valley , with 36@xmath7 within one red - sequence width of the lower boundary of the red sequence and 60@xmath7 within two red - sequence widths . with numerous other studies finding a similar connection , this implies that there is an association between this transitional region and agn activity .",
    "we divided our sample of five structures into two groups : the more and less evolved structures , which we separated using composite spectra made of all of their spectroscopically - confirmed member galaxies .",
    "we define the more evolved structures as those with member galaxies that exhibit , on average , less [ ]  emission and less h@xmath290absorption , where the [ ]  and h@xmath2 lines are taken as indicators of ongoing and recent star formation , respectively .",
    "the more evolved structures also have galaxy populations with a higher red fraction than the less evolved structures .",
    "our spectral results indicate that the agn hosts in the less evolved structures have more ongoing star formation , while those in the more evolved structures have stronger average h@xmath2 features .",
    "stronger h@xmath2 lines are indicative of star formation within the past @xmath61 gyr , and our results indicate starbursts occurred more recently in the agn host galaxies in the less evolved structures .",
    "however , all of the agn hosts , regardless of whether they are members of the more evolved or less evolved structures , are younger than the average galaxy in their parent population .",
    "we also found that agns in the less evolved structures had more luminous x - ray emission .",
    "this may be expected , since these structures contain the highest fraction of blue galaxies which are likely to have larger reservoirs of cool gas to fuel nuclear activity .",
    "if agns were triggered more recently in the less evolved structures , as the spectral data suggests , the difference in luminosity could also be related to a transition from `` quasar mode '' emission in newly triggered agns to `` radio mode '' emission at later times as supplies of inflowing cool gas are shut off .",
    "we consider several scenarios for agn triggering that are in agreement with our results .",
    "agns are triggered by major mergers or tidal interactions between blue cloud galaxies and/or agns are triggered episodically in red - sequence galaxies , fueled by recycled stellar material or induced by minor mergers .",
    "each of these scenarios could explain the association of agn hosts with the green valley .",
    "also , the h@xmath290absorption we observe could be indicative of the quenching of star formation that drives galaxies across the green valley .",
    "a previous study of the cl1604 agns by @xcite found that a majority of hosts had recent or pending mergers .",
    "half of the hosts had blue cores in otherwise red galaxies , which could support the second two scenarios , although other explanations are possible .",
    "some of our results , such as the difference in x - ray luminosities , could be explained if the agns in our sample were triggered by a mix of these modes , with a larger fraction of agns in the less evolved structures triggered by major mergers .",
    "however , we can not distinguish between the triggering scenarios with our data , so the cause of the agn activity is still ambiguous . future work investigating agn host morphologies , examining for blue cores , and calculating eddington ratios could potentially break the degeneracy .",

    "<S> we use deep chandra imaging and an extensive optical spectroscopy campaign on the keck 10-m telescopes to study the properties of x - ray point sources in two isolated x - ray selected clusters , two superclusters , and one ` supergroup ' at redshifts of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we first study x - ray point sources using the statistical measure of cumulative source counts , finding that the measured overdensities are consistent with previous results , but we recommend caution in overestimating the precision of the technique . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopy of objects matched to x - ray point sources confirms a total of 27 agns within the five structures , and we find that their host galaxies tend to be located away from dense cluster cores . </S>",
    "<S> more than @xmath1 of the host galaxies are located in the ` green valley ' on a color magnitude diagram , which suggests they are a transitional population . </S>",
    "<S> based on analysis of [ ]  and h@xmath2 line strengths , the average spectral properties of the agn host galaxies in all structures indicate either on - going star formation or a starburst within @xmath3 gyr , and that the host galaxies are younger than the average galaxy in the parent population . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate a clear connection between starburst and nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> we use composite spectra of the spectroscopically confirmed members in each structure ( cluster , supergroup , or supercluster ) to separate them based on a measure of the overall evolutionary state of their constituent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we define structures as having more evolved populations if their average galaxy has lower ew ( [ ] ) and ew(h@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agns in the more evolved structures have lower rest - frame 0.58 kev x - ray luminosities ( all below @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) and longer times since a starburst than those in the unevolved structures , suggesting that the peak of both star formation and agn activity has occurred at earlier times . with the wide range of evolutionary states and timeframes in the structures </S>",
    "<S> , we use our results to analyze the evolution of x - ray agns and evaluate potential triggering mechanisms . </S>"
