    "hierarchical formation of clusters of galaxies involves strong local variations of the potential field .",
    "these tidal perturbations affect the dynamics of infalling disk galaxies in a number of ways .",
    "firstly , they lead to the truncation of stellar and dark matter distributions at a critical radius of the roche lobe .",
    "secondly , they increase the stellar energy and the amount of random motion in the disk .",
    "tidal heating may be strong enough to completely unbind small galaxies and significantly transform larger ones . also , tidal heating is likely to stabilize stellar disks against gravitational instability and suppress subsequent star formation .",
    "the result of all these effects may be the morphological transformation of a spiral galaxy to an s0 type .",
    "such transformation is indeed revealed by the photometric and spectroscopic studies of clusters of galaxies at various redshifts ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "while the fraction of elliptical galaxies stays roughly the same , the abundance of spirals decreases by a factor of 2 to 3 from redshift 0.5 to the present .",
    "correspondingly , the number of s0 galaxies grows by the same amount .",
    "in @xcite i have argued that an important role in such a transformation is played by the tidal interactions of galaxies with their massive neighbors and with the global cluster halo . using numerical simulations of the representative clusters of galaxies in three different cosmological scenarios ,",
    "i have estimated the amount of tidal heating of the infalling galaxies .",
    "the main contribution comes from the interaction with the structures of order 100 kpc in size .",
    "previous studies ( @xcite ; and especially , moore et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; see more references in paper i ) have shown that close encounters between disk galaxies can significantly modify their structure and leave behind the distorted spheroidals .",
    "the interaction of galaxies with the cluster halo has also been studied @xcite in the case of static spherical cluster models .",
    "this leads to the tidal truncation of galaxies .    in this paper ,",
    "i investigate the dynamical effects of tidal heating of disk galaxies in the hierarchically forming clusters .",
    "i use a high - resolution self - consistent -body code to resimulate a sample of galaxies from the lower resolution cosmological simulations described in paper i. the changes in stellar orbits result from the effects of external tidal fields , computed from the second spatial derivative of the cluster potential along the galaxy trajectories .",
    "the fast variation of the tidal force produces tidal shocks responsible for the truncation of galactic halos and the kinematic heating of stars . in agreement with the estimates of paper i",
    ", i find stronger tidal heating in the low @xmath7 cosmological scenario .",
    "i use analytical arguments and discuss the expected evolution of galaxies via tidal heating in  [ sec : anal ] . in  [",
    "sec : sample ] , i describe the selection of the sample of galaxies from the cluster simulations . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , i present the numerical method and the tests of numerical relaxation .",
    "then i describe the evolution of large spiral galaxies in  [ sec : spiral ] , including the possible effects on the gas .",
    "the disruption of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies in  [ sec : lsb ] leads to the discussion of the origin of intracluster light .",
    "i compare these results with the previous studies in  [ sec : moore ] and discuss their observational implications in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "let us start with an analytic estimate to indicate the range of systems where tidal forces are important .",
    "the external tidal force is @xmath8 .",
    "the amplitude of the tidal field relates directly to the tidal stripping density , which is analogous to the instantaneous density of the roche lobe around galaxies but depends on the highest tidal peaks along the galactic orbit . if a part of the galaxy has lower density than the critical value , it would be stripped or torn apart . from poisson s equation ,",
    "the trace of the tidal tensor is @xmath9 .",
    "a typical value of the tidal peaks in paper i is @xmath10 gyr@xmath11 , and the corresponding tidal density is @xmath12 this should be compared with the combined average density @xmath13 of stars and dark matter in a galaxy .",
    "consider a milky way - type galaxy with a large isothermal halo and an exponential disk ( as in  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "the average halo density at the core radius is @xmath14 pc@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the velocity dispersion in units of 250 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the average disk density at one scale length is @xmath17 pc@xmath15 , where @xmath18 is the disk mass in units of @xmath19 .",
    "thus the inner regions of large spiral galaxies are stable against tidal disruption",
    ".    extended halos , falling outside the roche lobe , would be truncated at a radius @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "for our models this corresponds to the tidal radius @xmath22 kpc .",
    "in addition to the instantaneous stripping , secular tidal heating would enhance the mass loss .",
    "stellar disks with @xmath23 kpc are better protected ",
    "99% of their mass is within the tidal radius",
    ".    on other hand , low surface brightness galaxies ( including the dwarf spheroidals ) are in danger of being disrupted by tidal forces .",
    "the lsb galaxies have lower density than normal spirals , @xmath24 pc@xmath15 , and are dominated by dark matter at all radii .",
    "thus their disks would hold as long as they are being protected by the halos .",
    "even though the halo velocity dispersions are similar to those in large spiral galaxies , the larger sizes imply lower density and so stronger truncation .",
    "stirred further by tidal shocks , the lsb galaxies would lose most of their mass , leaving behind extended tidal streams of stars and dark matter .",
    "these qualitative arguments are supported by detailed simulations in  [ sec : spiral ] and  [ sec : lsb ] .",
    "the total amount of dark matter stripped from the galaxies can be estimated analytically in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "assume that all mass of the cluster belonged initially to the galaxies , distributed according to the schechter luminosity function @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "let the mass - to - light ratio be constant and use the @xcite relation for the velocity dispersion , @xmath27 .",
    "the characteristic break of the luminosity function , @xmath28 , corresponds to the mass scale @xmath29 .",
    "finally , assume that the density profiles of the galaxies and the cluster are isothermal with the three - dimensional velocity dispersions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the characteristic values in the simulations of paper i are @xmath32 km s@xmath3 and @xmath33 km s@xmath3",
    ". then the galactic halos will be truncated at @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance of closest approach to the cluster center ( pericenter ) . for many galaxies",
    "this distance is of the order the cluster core radius , @xmath36 kpc , which gives the truncation radius @xmath37 kpc .",
    "the halo mass is then reduced to @xmath38 tidal truncation modifies the mass function of galaxies such that the effective exponential cutoff occurs at @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite estimates the fraction of mass remaining bound to the galaxies as 0.7 @xmath41 , or about 6% in our case .",
    "tidal heating would further reduce the mass of the galaxies .    for a massive cluster cl 0024 + 1654 , @xcite were able to infer the mass distribution using image reconstruction of the strong gravitational lensing .",
    "the potential of the cluster appears to be very smooth , with only 2% of the mass bound to luminous galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with our estimate , as the velocity dispersion of cl 0024 + 1654 is twice that of our clusters .",
    "thus even if the galaxies contained all of the cluster mass initially , they would retain only a small fraction of it after tidal stripping .",
    "the sample of galaxies to be re - simulated is chosen from the lower resolution cosmological simulations reported in paper i. the particle - mesh ( pm ) simulations use constrained initial conditions to produce representative clusters of galaxies for the three cosmological scenarios : @xmath0 ( cluster i ) , @xmath1 ( cluster ii ) , and @xmath42 ( cluster iii ) .",

    "the virial radii of the clusters are \\{1.0 , 1.5 , 1.4 } @xmath44 mpc , respectively . the hubble constant is taken to be @xmath45 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the mass function of identified halos follows the prediction of the press - schechter theory for halos more massive than @xmath47 in cluster i and @xmath48 in clusters ii and iii .",
    "some of the lower mass halos are missing due to overmerging , because the pm resolution is only 60 @xmath44 kpc .",
    "the orbits of 100 most massive galaxies in each cluster are traced through the simulation starting from redshift @xmath49 using a subset of the most bound galactic particles to calculate its center - of - mass motion .",
    "the galactic trajectories calculated in paper i are unique among other cosmological simulations in that ( i ) they are real trajectories of the halos in the evolving cluster , and not equilibrium orbits in the final cluster potential ; ( ii ) the motion of each identified halo is traced through the simulation at each time step with an unprecedented temporal resolution , @xmath50 yr ; ( iii ) the trajectories are calculated only for 1 hubble time , which limits the average number of orbital periods to 24 ; and ( iv ) the trajectories are affected by the triaxiality of the cluster halo , which can make initially radial orbits gain angular momentum and avoid the central regions .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of a galaxy is defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath35 are the median apo- and pericenter distances , respectively , of the galactic orbit between @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",

    "they are lower than in the high - resolution simulation of @xcite , who integrated the orbits in the spherically - symmetric potential approximating the cluster at the present .",
    "the different method of calculating orbits may be the cause of the difference in the results .",
    "in addition to the smaller eccentricities , the physical ( not comoving ) pericenter distances of galaxies in cluster i are also larger .",
    "for the three cluster samples , @xmath55 kpc .",
    "the pericenter distances may be relatively large because the clusters move throughout the simulation as they form hierarchically .",

    "this would not change the tidal histories of the dwarfs because they are still too small to affect the evolution of the cluster potential .",
    "the dynamical evolution of galaxies is modeled using the self - consistent field method @xcite . in this type of collisionless -body code , the potential and density are expanded in a series of biorthogonal basis functions @xmath65 which satisfy individually poisson s equation : @xmath66 this assures that the linear combinations of the basis functions satisfy poisson s equation automatically .",

    "the tidal tensor has comparable components in all directions , and therefore the results should not depend on the initial disk orientation .      before studying the effects of tidal heating",
    ", it is very important to assess the extent to which the simulations are affected by numerical artifacts .",
    "the main is numerical relaxation , which results in erroneous heating of stellar orbits .",
    "this relaxation arises from poisson fluctuations of the coarse - grained potential represented by a finite number of particles , @xmath106 .",
    "this is much smaller than the number of stars in real galaxies , and therefore the relaxation rate is artificially high ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "i have run five test models in isolation in order to check the dependence of numerical heating on the number of particles and the time step ( tables [ tab : isola ] and [ tab : isolb ] ) .",
    "the first model , l  isol , is the main model for large spiral galaxies l1l3 and the next three are its modifications with reduced number of particles or increased time step .",
    "the last isolated model , lsb  isol3 , is that of a large low surface brightness galaxy lsb3 .",
    "the tests run for 12 gyr , the longest simulation time of the three cosmological scenarios .    due to the diffusive nature of the relaxation process ,",
    "both the first and second order changes of stellar energy are comparable , @xmath107 . however , the former may change sign and vary randomly , whereas the latter rises monotonically in time and offers a better measure of relaxation . the average energy change of disk particles at the end of run l ",
    "isol is small , @xmath108 .",
    "table [ tab : isola ] shows that the radial mass distribution of the disk remains exponential and the scale length , @xmath88 , changes only by 4% .",
    "the halo also remains spherical , with the axis ratios @xmath109 and @xmath110 close to unity .",
    "the only noticeable difference is the vertical heating of the disk .",
    "the average scale height , @xmath89 , increases by a factor 1.7 and the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath111 rises similarly . as figure [ fig : heatzr ] shows ( lower dots ) , the thickening is stronger near the center where the density of particles is higher and the relaxation is expected to be faster .",
    "another statistic of disk heating is the change of the linear vertical energy . in equilibrium",
    "it can be defined using the epicycle theory as @xmath112 where the second derivative of the potential is evaluated in the plane of the disk ( for a thin disk it is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the surface density ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ez ] ) is strictly an integral of motion only near the midplane , where the disk dominates gravity . in the isolated",
    "runs the vertical energy @xmath115 changes significantly more than the total energy @xmath116 , by the order itself ( table [ tab : isolb ] ) .",
    "but this is consistent with the changes of the scale height and the vertical velocity dispersion .    with half the number of particles in model l  isol2 ,",
    "the second order energy change is 0.8% .",
    "the vertical energy and the scale height are proportionately larger , while the radial scale length and the figure of the halo are unchanged . if only the number of disk particles is reduced ( model l",
    " isol3 ) , the heating is slightly less but similar to the previous case .",
    "thus only the vertical structure of the disk is sensitive to numerical relaxation , when the number of particles in simulation @xmath106 .",
    "the time step in the main simulations is @xmath117 in code units , or about 1% of the half - mass rotation period , @xmath118 . in a thin disk the stellar orbits",
    "should be calculated accurately even in the center , where the rotation period decreases by 60% as the disk density increases by a factor of 5 . however , once the relaxation raises velocities artificially high , the stellar motion deviates more and more significantly from the original orbits .",
    "doubling the time step in model l ",
    "isol1 leads to larger energy changes than in the other isolated models .",
    "this effect is coupled to numerical relaxation and , therefore , both are more important in the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "this is not a problem for the present study because , by construction , external tidal forces vanish in the center .",
    "tidal effects are more significant in the outer regions of the galaxy where both numerical artifacts are less important .    while the artificial thickening of the disk is certainly undesirable , it can be corrected for in a statistical way .",
    "the relaxation rate , @xmath119 , is constant in time and the scale height @xmath120 increases linearly ( cf .",
    "upper panel of figure [ fig : heatz ] ) , as expected for pure poisson fluctuations .",
    "thus at any time it can be subtracted from the real simulation to accentuate the effects of tidal heating .",
    "assuming that the numerical heating is statistically independent from the external tidal heating , the two effects add in quadrature and the modified scale height can be defined as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the initial scale height .",
    "the least squares fit to the growth rate is @xmath123 in the following section we derive the rate of numerical relaxation in a thin disk to confirm that the growth of @xmath124 is consistent with the self - interaction of disk particles and with the heating by more massive halo particles .",
    "@xcite have derived the median relaxation time for a smooth spherical system of mass @xmath125 and half - mass radius @xmath126 : @xmath127 it describes very well the rate of heating in simulations , even including the resonant interactions of stars ( see the discussion in @xcite , based on the results of @xcite ) .",
    "the relaxation is dominated by distant encounters with large impact parameters @xmath128 , parametrized by the coulomb logarithm , @xmath129 .",
    "the system relaxes on many ( @xmath130 ) dynamical times and for large enough @xmath131 can be considered collisionless .",
    "however , @xcite has emphasized that the relaxation time is much shorter in the infinitely thin disks , of the order an orbital period ( see also @xcite , problem 8 - 6 ) .",
    "this is due to the close encounters dominating in 2d geometry , instead of the distant encounters in 3d geometry .",
    "in a disk of finite thickness this effect largely disappears , but there is another effect that leads to faster relaxation .",
    "the collective response of stars to a perturbation is greatly enhanced when the stellar motions are highly ordered in a kinematically cold disk @xcite .",
    "since the stellar orbits are still largely confined to a plane , the most noticeable effect of disk relaxation is the heating in vertical direction .      for the general case of a thin disk with an initial scale height @xmath132 and vertical velocity dispersion @xmath133 ,",
    "the relaxation rate can be estimated as follows .",
    "the velocity kick in the vertical direction from a single encounter with a star @xmath134 at an impact parameter @xmath135 and relative velocity @xmath136 is @xmath137 .",
    "the encounter velocity is of the order the radial and azimuthal dispersion in the plane .",
    "most of stellar encounters take place at a median height above the plane , where the density of the double - exponential disk ( eq . [ [ eq : rhod ] ] ) is half of that in the plane , @xmath138 .",
    "the integrated effect of encounters at all impact parameters is then @xmath139 where @xmath140 kpc and @xmath141 kpc ( set by the resolution scale ) . in the simplest case , as a result of heating the surface density @xmath114 remains the same but the scale height @xmath89 increases in time .",
    "the rate of increase can be calculated from the relation @xmath142 , which should hold as long as the disk is still relatively thin : @xmath143 the solution is @xmath144 where the vertical relaxation time is @xmath145 for @xmath146 km s@xmath3 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 kpc , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "the corresponding rise of the vertical velocity dispersion is @xmath151 this matches qualitatively the heating of the disk by massive molecular clouds ( cf .",
    "the initial growth is linear and the maximum rate is @xmath152 gyr@xmath3 , which is in reasonable agreement with the observed rate of growth in the isolated simulation ( eq . [ [ eq : z0rate ] ] ) .",
    "if the stars were distributed spherically rather than in the disk , the relaxation time would be significantly longer ( eq . [ [ eq : trh ] ] ) , @xmath153 yr . alternatively ,",
    "if the stars were confined to an infinitely thin disk , the heating rate ( in the plane ) would be @xmath154 this rate ( clearly dominated by close encounters ) is faster than the finite - thickness rate ( dominated by distant encounters , eq . [ [ eq : dsigmadt ] ] ) by a factor @xmath155 .",
    "so as expected , the finite - thickness disk provides an intermediate case between the 2d and the 3d geometry .",
    "when the disk is surrounded by a dark halo , the heating by massive halo particles can be more important .",
    "the heating rate by the particles with mass @xmath156 and density @xmath157 is @xmath158 where the encounter velocity @xmath136 is dominated by the halo dispersion , @xmath159 .",
    "the ratio of the heating rates due to the halo and disk particles is @xmath160 the typical parameters in our models at @xmath88 are @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , so the two heating rates are comparable",
    ". however , the growth of the scale height is different because now the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : dsigmadt_h ] ) is independent of @xmath164 and @xmath165 with @xmath166 this interaction with the halo particles is equivalent to the heating by massive black holes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath167 , @xmath168 km s@xmath3 , @xmath169 km s@xmath3 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 pc@xmath15 ,",
    "the relaxation time is @xmath172 gyr .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the growth rate in the isolated simulation ( eq . [ [ eq : z0rate ] ] ) .",
    "thus , both disk and halo particles contribute to the disk thickening , although in the long run the heating by halo particles would dominate .    having a certain understanding of the numerical relaxation in the disk , when it sets in ( eqs .

    ", we move to the simulation results .",
    "we start with the results for large disk galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of particles at the beginning and the end of the simulation of galaxy l1 .",
    "the first important result is that the galaxy survives tidal heating .",
    "it still looks like a disk galaxy of roughly the same size .",
    "large , coherent spiral arms form in the outer regions .",
    "the disk shrinks in the radial direction and flares at the fuzzy edges .",
    "but the main difference from the initial configuration is a substantial thickening of the disk .",
    "viewed at a certain surface brightness limit , this thick and round disk galaxy may be classified as an s0 .",
    "the dark matter distribution is relatively simple .",
    "the galaxy has been stripped of about 40% of its halo ( table [ tab : fingal ] ) and has shrunk to the limits of the stellar disk . inside the truncation radius ,",
    "the halo has been little affected ( figure [ fig : denh ] ) .",
    "the figure of the halo becomes triaxial but only mildly , with the smallest axis ratio @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the amount of the remaining halo mass is indicated simply by the truncation radius , @xmath20 .",
    "for galaxy l1 it changes from 60 kpc to 37 kpc .",

    "the surface density exhibits noticeable wiggles superimposed on the otherwise exponential disk .",
    "in addition to truncating the halo , a major effect of tidal heating is the thickening of the disk . by construction",
    ", the external tidal force vanishes at the center and increases linearly with radius .",
    "figure [ fig : heatzr ] demonstrates that the disk flares in the outer parts .",
    "numerical relaxation affects the disk structure only within the inner two scale lengths , where tidal heating is negligible . at @xmath177 ,",
    "the external tidal effects are clearly dominant .",
    "a direct evidence of tidal heating is the dramatic increase of all three velocity components in the outer regions of the disk ( figure [ fig : dispd ] ) .",

    "in contrast , the velocity dispersion of the halo decreases in the outer parts due to the significant mass loss .    the analysis of the other large spirals shows a lot of similarity but with quantitative differences .",
    "since the tidal field is stronger in the low @xmath7 clusters ( see  [ sec : tidhis ] ) , galaxies l2 and l3 are subject to stronger perturbations than galaxy l1 .",
    "galaxy l2 suffers the biggest mass loss , about 64% , while galaxy l3 provides the intermediate case with about 50% .",
    "their truncation radii fall below 30 kpc .",
    "the disks of both galaxies l2 and l3 are heated more strongly than in galaxy l1 .",
    "figure [ fig : halom ] shows that the mass loss from the three halos is not steady .",
    "there are several instants of large losses associated with the maxima of the tidal force .",
    "examining the particle distribution at successive epochs reveals how the halo is being stripped . after a strong tidal shock , a cloud of dark matter particles disperses across the tidal boundary and slowly drifts away from the galaxy in two opposite directions along the same line .",
    "that line corresponds to the direction of the strongest component of the tidal tensor at the time .",
    "the unbound particles are later stretched along that direction further and further away from the galaxy .    as figure [ fig : heatr ] shows , the disk scale lengths of all three galaxies remain almost constant .",
    "in contrast , the vertical scale heights rise monotonically with time ( figure [ fig : heatz ] ) . while a part of this effect is due to the numerical relaxation ( eq . [ [ eq : z0num ] ] ) , the corrected scale height @xmath178 measures the thickening only due to the tidal heating .",
    "galaxy l2 leads in the rate of expansion , in agreement with other indicators of evolution , the mass loss and the velocity dispersion increase . at the end of the run ,",
    "its scale height is more than doubled .",
    "the other two galaxies experience more modest evolution .",
    "in particular , the disk of galaxy l3 had expanded to its maximum height in 7 gyr and then remained effectively unchanged for the same amount of time until the present .      in order to quantify the dependence of the results on numerical details , such as the time step and the number of particles , i have run three additional models of galaxy l3 ( table [ tab : l3gal ] ) . they are simulated using the same parameters as the isolated models \\{l  isol1 , l ",
    "isol2 , l  isol3 } but with the external tidal field of galaxy l3 .",
    "the corresponding isolated runs are used to correct the scale height @xmath178 .    in model 1 ,",
    "the time step is doubled while the number of particles is kept the same , relative to the main model of l3 .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : isolation ] , the time step is chosen small enough to represent accurately stellar orbits even in the center ; @xmath179 yr . indeed , with the doubled time step model 1 reproduces most of the features of model l3 .",
    "the main changes are the 13% stronger thickening of the disk and a slightly longer radial scale length .    in model 2 ,",
    "half the number of particles is used in both the disk and the halo with the original time step .",
    "the results are very close to those of model l3 .",
    "the changes of the scale length and the corrected scale height are not noticeable at all .    in model 3 , where only the number of disk particles is reduced by half",
    ", the scale height grows even less than in model l3 .",
    "this indicates that most of the numerical heating of disk particles is produced by the interaction with massive halo particles , as expected . in all three test",
    "runs the halo structure and mass loss are virtually identical .",
    "the conclusion from these tests is that only the vertical structure of the disk is sensitive to numerical effects .",
    "variations of the time step and the number of particles affect the corrected scale height @xmath178 by 10% to 30% .",
    "thus the deviation of our main results from the case of infinite resolution is expected to be of the same order .",
    "the necessary truncation of the spherical harmonics series in equation ( [ eq : potser ] ) imposes a limit on the vertical force resolution in a thin disk .",
    "an accurate calculation of the force with @xmath180 may require the expansion order @xmath181 .",
    "our simulations with @xmath182 thus have an effectively smoothed vertical force within the disk , and the comparison with the forces calculated by direct summation shows significant deviations at @xmath183 . from the scf simulations",
    "alone it is difficult to assess how this could affect the response of the disk to external perturbations . in order to test sensitivity of the results to force resolution",
    ", i use the publicly - available tree code @xcite and resimulate large galaxy models l1 , l2 , and l3 .",
    "the tree algorithm with an accuracy parameter @xmath184 calculates the vertical forces in our thin disks within 1% of the direct summation result .",
    "the algorithm is , however , much more computationally expensive and can be realistically used only with a subset of particles . with @xmath185 , @xmath186 ,",
    "one parallel  simulation takes 150 hours on 8 processors of the beowulf pc cluster at stsci .",
    "i use a type 0 time step criterion based on local particle acceleration @xmath187 and softening parameter @xmath188 : @xmath189 , and limit the time step not to exceed 0.1 in code units ( @xmath190 yr , the same step as in the scf runs ) .",
    "the average time step was @xmath191 in code units . in order to adequately resolve the vertical structure of the disk and to minimize relaxation effects ,",
    "i take the softening parameter @xmath192 for disk particles and @xmath193 for halo particles , using the definition of @xcite .",
    "since the numerical heating of the disk is largely due to the massive halo particles , i run two sets of models increasing @xmath194 from @xmath195 to @xmath196 .",
    "the number of disk particles is fixed at @xmath197 ( these numbers are limited by a realistic run time ) .",
    "in the control run in isolation with @xmath198 the disk size shows a large increase ( @xmath199 )",
    "but so does a corresponding scf run with the same number of particles ( @xmath200 ) . in the control",
    "run with @xmath201 the numerical heating is already reduced ( @xmath202 ) almost to the level of the main scf runs . in both isolated  simulations the radial scale length changes by less than 1% .",
    "this agrees with the discussion in  [ sec : numrel ] that numerical heating depends primarily on the number and masses of particles .",
    "table [ tab : gadget ] shows the results of  simulations for models l1l3 .",
    "overall , the disk heating is somewhat stronger than in the scf runs : both @xmath203 and @xmath88 increase by roughly 10% .",
    "the vertical heating is much stronger in the runs with fewer halo particles  this is clear evidence that numerical relaxation can affect the evolution of thin disks even with adequate force resolution .",
    "the thickening of the disk is less monotonic in the  runs .",
    "sudden jumps of @xmath203 , for example at 5 gyr and 9 gyr for model l2 , coincide with larger than usual deviations of the disk center - of - mass from the halo center - of - mass .",
    "the two can differ by @xmath204 pc after a strong perturbation , and in such an unrelaxed state the disk appears thicker .",
    "note that this deviation is still within @xmath205 . in models l1 and l3 , and in all scf runs , @xmath206 pc .",
    "the disk appears symmetric in the vertical direction and shows no sign of warping .",
    "the orientations of the inner and outer parts of the disk , divided at @xmath207 , differ by less than @xmath208 ( @xmath209 for scf runs ) .",
    "a noticeably difference in the  runs is the radial expansion of the disks . in the scf models , @xmath88 was essentially unchanged",
    ". this might be a result of the restoring forces being effectively `` anisotropic '' within the disk : while the radial expansion is sufficiently accurate , the vertical expansion is smoothed .",
    "fortunately , the difference with the  results is only @xmath210 .    as a result of the increase of @xmath88 ,",
    "the circular velocity drops correspondingly by about 10% in all  models .",
    "however , the halo structure in the  runs almost exactly mirrors that in the scf runs .",
    "the only deviation of the halo mass is in model l3 ( by 3% ) , while the shapes of the halos are similar .",
    "i conclude that apart from @xmath88 , the only quantity susceptible to the errors in force resolution is @xmath203 , and while it increases by a factor @xmath211 in the scf runs the true value is probably in the range @xmath212 .      in cluster simulations presented in paper i , the amount of tidal heating has been estimated using the tidal heating parameter , @xmath213 .",
    "it is simply the square of the integrated velocity change summed over all peaks of the tidal force @xmath83 ( @xmath214 ) : @xmath215 it is also corrected for the conservation of adiabatic invariants of stellar orbits when the external perturbations are long , using the parametrization of @xcite . here",
    "@xmath216 is the effective duration of peak @xmath217 for each value of @xmath93 and @xmath218 , and @xmath219 is the half - mass dynamical time of the galaxy ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "the average energy change due to tidal heating for the stars at radius @xmath67 is @xmath221 this semi - analytical estimate provides a good description of the energy changes of particles in the simulation and can be used to compare tidal effects for different galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in each cluster sample show an exponential distribution of the tidal parameter , @xmath222 .",
    "the characteristic parameter @xmath223 is the largest in cluster ii ( @xmath224 gyr@xmath11 ) , intermediate in cluster iii ( @xmath225 gyr@xmath11 ) , and the smallest in cluster i ( @xmath226 gyr@xmath11 ; see paper i ) .",
    "the simulations of galaxies l1l3 show noticeable differences in the evolution of large spiral galaxies in the three cosmological models . in agreement with the estimates of the tidal heating parameter ,",
    "galaxy l2 experiences stronger evolution than galaxies l1 and l3 .    however , these differences may not serve as a clear discriminant among the cosmological models .",
    "the distribution of tidal parameters within the same cluster leads to a comparable variance of the results .",
    "the additional simulations of two galaxies from cluster iii prove this point .",
    "the two computed models , l3a and l3b , use the same initial conditions as galaxy l3 but different tidal histories .",
    "these galaxies , corresponding to the cluster iii halos # 13 and # 73 , have some of the largest heating parameters , @xmath227 gyr@xmath11 and @xmath228 gyr@xmath11 , respectively . for comparison , the reference galaxy l3 has @xmath229 gyr@xmath11 .",
    "these models represent the strongest cases of tidal evolution .",
    "as expected , galaxy l3b loses more mass and develops a thicker disk than model l3 , while for l3a the trend is the opposite ( table [ tab : fingal ] ) .",
    "the final state of galaxy l3b is similar to that of model l2 from cluster ii . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxy l3a is closer to model l1 from cluster i. thus the distribution of tidal histories of galaxies within the same cluster leads to a similar variation of the dynamical evolution .",
    "the adiabatic correction factor in equation ( [ eq : ipar ] ) is very important .",
    "it accounts for the temporal structure of the tidal field and suppresses the perturbations with long timescales to which galaxies respond adiabatically . without that factor ,",
    "galaxy l3a would have had a higher value of @xmath230 than galaxy l3b .",
    "the difference is due to the tidal force being more `` impulsive '' for galaxy l3b , while being more `` adiabatic '' for l3a .",
    "the simulations of large spiral galaxies show that the kinematic heating and vertical expansion of the disks lead to a significant morphological transformation .",
    "an initially normal spiral may be identified in the end as a lenticular galaxy , an s0 .",
    "the following section puts this claim to a thorough observational check .",
    "the final snapshot of galaxy l1 ( figure 2 ) looks similar to the deep exposures of the s0 galaxy ngc 4762 @xcite .",
    "the disk is thick and ends with fuzzy warps .",
    "a modest central mass concentration is seen in both the simulation and the real galaxy .",
    "the most detailed data are available for nearby s0 galaxies in the field @xcite .",
    "the hst images of lenticulars in distant clusters @xcite usually provide only integrated light and colors .",
    "typically , the surface brightness profiles of s0s are well fitted by a combination of the exponential disk and the @xmath231 bulge .",
    "the simulations reported here do not include a bulge component initially .",
    "in fact , one of the goals of this study was to investigate whether a bulge forms as a result of tidal heating .",
    "two competing effects play a role here : stars on average gain energy from tidal perturbations and move generally outward ; on the other hand , the tidally - induced energy dispersion contributes to two - body relaxation and accretion onto the center .",
    "figure [ fig : dend ] shows that no appreciable bulge forms from the disk particles , asserting that the relaxation time is still much longer than the age of the galaxy .",
    "however , the interstellar gas may be driven inward by tidal effects and ignite a burst of star formation ( @xcite ; see also  [ sec : gas ] ) .",
    "this would assist in the formation of a prominent bulge .",
    "s0 galaxies typically have the same disk scale lengths as the spirals of similar luminosity @xcite . in the present simulations",
    "the scale length @xmath88 is virtually unchanged .",
    "also , the axis ratios of the simulated disks , 0.15 to 0.25 , are consistent with the average observed value of 0.2 - 0.25 for the `` thick disks '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to decompose the vertical brightness profile of late type edge - on galaxies into a combination of the thin and thick disks .",
    "the latter dominate in the outer regions of the galaxies and are much more prominent in s0s than in spirals .",
    "thick disks are not as centrally peaked as thin disks and have a shallow radial gradient : they look `` diffuse '' and `` boxy '' .",
    "all this is consistent with having a tidal origin ; flaring of the disk was expected and has been detected in the simulations .",
    "kinematic information is available only for the local galaxies . in a cold exponential disk ,",
    "vertical velocity dispersion should fall with radius as the surface density : @xmath232 .",
    "in a sample of ten s0 galaxies @xcite the velocity dispersion flattens at @xmath233 km s@xmath3 and even rises in the outer regions .",
    "similarly , a large study of the early type galaxies by @xcite shows a systematic increase of the total velocity dispersion at large radii , often exceeding 100 km s@xmath3 .",
    "present simulations certainly confirm this trend .    finally , note that bars are commonly found in s0 galaxies .",
    "a single tidal interaction may excite bar instability in an axisymmetric galaxy , but a succession of tidal shocks and the resulting kinematic heating would isotropize stellar orbits and destroy the bar . the actual survival of bars , then , depends on the amount of tidal heating in the inner galaxy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "present simulations , which include a stabilizing dark matter halo , do not show any detectable bar .",
    "the evolution of spiral galaxies depends sensitively on the amount and distribution of the interstellar gas .",
    "even though the collisionless simulations do not address gas dynamics directly , it is possible to infer qualitative features of the gas response to tidal heating .",
    "the external tidal force is not steady in time , it comes in a series of peaks ( cf .",

    ", it would cool back to @xmath243 k in @xmath244 yr . in reality",
    "the gas would likely heat less efficiently and therefore cool faster .    however , the thick stellar disk is now stable against gravitational perturbations and is unlikely to form new stars .",

    "even the minimum value , @xmath246 , is large enough to suppress any axisymmetric disk instability . under such conditions spiral structure and gaseous shocks",

    "the spiral arms visible in figure 2 are prominent only in the outer regions , where the diffuse gas is likely to be ionized or stripped by the intracluster medium .",
    "the stability of stellar disks is modified in the presence of cold gas .",

    "it shows that the disk is unstable only when the mass of cold gas is at least 50% of the stellar mass , a condition rarely satisfied in any spiral or s0 galaxy even in the field .",
    "current theories of star formation in normal spiral galaxies often rely on a continuous infall of cold gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this infall supplies the material for new stars and also helps to sustain a marginal dynamical instability of the disk .",

    "this statistical trend is opposite to that expected for ram pressure stripping , since more massive galaxies should hold on to their gaseous component better .",
    "having considered several possible mechanisms , @xcite conclude that the  deficiency can only be explained by tidal interactions .",
    "finally , note that numerical simulations of galaxy interactions @xcite often show a dramatic loss of angular momentum of the gas , drawing it to the center and igniting a powerful starburst .",
    "this is corroborated by the observation that galaxies with distorted profiles are more likely to be detected in h@xmath93 than the undistorted ones @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a 50% higher detection rate of sa galaxies in the eight nearby abell clusters than in the field .",
    "these starbursts may also blow away the remaining gas from small galaxies @xcite , leaving behind only compact stellar spheroids .",

    "table [ tab : initgal ] shows that the stellar disks are small and are completely dominated by dark matter .",
    "still , the density of the halo cores is low , @xmath265 pc@xmath15 , dangerously close to the critical tidal density ( eq . [ [ eq : rhotid ] ] ) .",
    "the peaks of the tidal force can reach as high as 200 gyr@xmath11 , which corresponds to the tidal density of @xmath266 pc@xmath15 .",

    "dark matter dominates everywhere and determines the stability of stellar disks against tidal disruption . for galaxies lsb1 and lsb2 the average halo density in the core , @xmath270 pc@xmath15 , is above the critical tidal density , but galaxy lsb3 with @xmath271 pc@xmath15 is not expected to survive .",

    "the discoveries in the coma cluster of the giant diffuse arc with the surface brightness @xmath280 mag arcsec@xmath11 by @xcite and the diffuse plume - like feature with @xmath281 mag arcsec@xmath11 by @xcite may provide the examples of a complete tidal disruption .",

    "is there enough lsb galaxies to provide the origin of diffuse intracluster light ?",
    "the fraction of stars stripped from the galaxies can be estimated as follows .",
    "assume that the initial galaxy luminosity function is given by equation ( [ eq : lumfun ] ) and that the luminosity , along with the mass , scales linearly with the initial extent of the galaxy : @xmath282 .",
    "tidal truncation removes stars beyond the radius @xmath283 , where @xmath284 is the tidal radius of @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "then the luminosity after truncation is @xmath285 , and the fraction of dispersed light as a function of @xmath286 is @xmath287 where the total luminosity of the cluster is @xmath288 . using the adopted luminosity function and the faber - jackson relation @xmath289 ,",
    "the distribution becomes @xmath290 the simulations show that @xmath291 kpc and the typical ratio @xmath292 . for @xmath293 , the distribution peaks around the characteristic scale @xmath294 .",
    "this calculation shows that most of the stripped stars come from giant @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "since the giants dominate the integrated light of both high and low surface brightness galaxies , the amount of the intracluster light in the tidal disruption scenario is proportional to the average fraction of lsb galaxies .",
    "the comparison of the apm survey and the cfa redshift survey @xcite shows that lsb galaxies contribute about 20% of the total light in the field .",
    "@xcite find that this fraction may even be higher .",
    "also , in the fornax cluster the lsb galaxies contain 20% to 30% of the total light @xcite .",
    "thus the disruption of large low surface brightness galaxies would naturally account for the intracluster light .",
    "the idea of transforming spirals into s0s by tidal heating in clusters is not new . from the study of galaxy collisions in cluster cores",
    ", @xcite finds that the dark matter halos are severely truncated .",
    "simulations of the tidal heating of colliding galaxies @xcite suggest that the disks grow in scale height , up to @xmath295 . despite the limitations of analytical cluster models and small number of particles , these early studies agree qualitatively with the more advanced computations .    a detailed investigation of galaxies in clusters has not been possible until very recently .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have conducted the first high - resolution simulation of the tidal effects , using a singular isothermal cluster model populated by a large number of tidally - truncated galaxies .",
    "both the neighbor galaxies and the cluster halo exerted tides on the galaxy simulated with higher resolution .",
    "moore et al . predicted a strong evolution : the disks of medium size spirals ( @xmath296 ) were destroyed and transformed into dwarf spheroidals .",
    "two effects may have contributed to this : ( i ) they used the cluster with a higher velocity dispersion ( like coma ) where the tidal forces are stronger than in the clusters ( like virgo ) simulated here , and ( ii ) the clusters growing hierarchically had less time to exert tidal effects than a steady massive cluster .",
    "more recent simulations of @xcite have incorporated the hierarchical cluster formation in the @xmath297 cosmology and indicate more moderate tidal evolution .",
    "they find that the disks of high surface brightness spirals survive within their dark matter halos but expand in vertical direction by a factor 2 to 3 .",
    "their new results are in a much better agreement with our models l1l3 .    due to a smaller number of particles in the disk ( @xmath298 ) and in the halo ( @xmath299 )",
    ", @xcite simulations could suffer from numerical relaxation more strongly than our results .",

    "[ [ eq : trelh ] ] ) . however , their fig .",
    "5 shows that in 5 gyr the disk has expanded by only slightly more than a factor of 2 , which corresponds to a relaxation time of 4.5 gyr .",
    "thus for some reason , in moore s simulation the numerical relaxation rate is three times slower . the only worrying sign is the steepening of the central density profile of the lsb galaxy in their fig .",
    "7 . since tidal heating vanishes in the center",
    "it can not be responsible for this effect , which could instead be a manifestation of the artificial `` core collapse '' .",
    "@xcite have examined the survival of the disks as a function of their mass , scale length , and the core radius of the surrounding dark matter halo .",
    "they find that compact disks are stable regardless of the halo core radius and that extended disks are stabilized by denser halos . all this can be explained in terms of a single tidal density parameter ( cf .",
    "[ [ eq : rhotid ] ] ) .",
    "the galaxies are stable if their combined inner density , of stars and dark matter , is above the tidal density .",
    "the results of table 1 of @xcite indicate the truncation radius of about 20 kpc for small halo core radii ( @xmath304 kpc ) and about 10 kpc for large core radii ( @xmath305 kpc ) , all of which correspond to a tidal density @xmath306 pc@xmath15 .",
    "( the fraction of stars lost is independent of the disk mass as long as the dark halo dominates , @xmath307 . )    despite different cluster models and simulation methods , the critical tidal densities in @xcite and in this paper agree within a factor of two , and the predicted dynamical evolution of galaxies is also similar .",
    "some of the difference may be due to the close encounters of neighbor galaxies within 60 @xmath44 kpc , which are not resolved in my cluster simulations ( paper i estimates that these encounters contribute 10% to 50% of the overall tidal heating , @xmath230 , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : ipar ] ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that such a simple concept as the tidal density of the roche lobe provides a quantitatively accurate description of detailed simulations .",
    "it offers a direct way to compare the results of different authors .    tidal disruption of galaxies as the origin of intracluster light has been envisioned by @xcite .",
    "he argued that the most probable time for disruption is during the cluster collapse .",
    "@xcite also confirm the disruption of lsb galaxies in their simulations . @xcite",
    "present an excellent example of a diffuse arc structure in the centaurus cluster and explain it with the debris of a low surface brightness galaxy disrupted by the giant elliptical ngc 4709 .",
    "their finding that the stripped stars produce diffuse features like those observed goes along with the results of  [ sec : lsb ] . on a scale of the local group ,",
    "@xcite find that the observed dwarf spheroidal galaxies could be the remnants of tidally - disrupted lsb progenitors .",
    "it should also be mentioned that @xcite has combined the self - consistent cluster evolution with the galactic simulation in a single parallel tree - code run .",
    "he aimed to study the formation of a giant cd galaxy in the cluster center through a sequence of mergers of smaller galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , his approach does not allow enough resolution to follow the dynamics of galaxies other than the central giant .",
    "the main result of this work is a natural and quantitative explanation of the transformation of spiral galaxies into s0s .",
    "the simulations show that even on the orbits with maximum expected tidal heating , large disk galaxies still remain flattened and not elliptical .",
    "the evolution of elliptical galaxies must have proceeded prior to the cluster formation .",
    "the main advance is made with the supporting simulations of the hierarchical cluster formation , reported in paper i. the galactic orbits , the tidal field along them , and the timescales of dynamical evolution are all representative of the three plausible cosmological scenarios of structure formation .",
    "the evolution is stronger in the models ( @xmath308 ) where galaxies spend more time in the dense cluster environment .    unlike previous studies with analytical cluster models",
    ", this work demonstrates that tidal heating is not limited to the cluster core because large local substructures are present in all parts of the forming clusters .",
    "in fact , most of the observable effects ( halo truncation and disk heating ) happen in the outer regions , as soon as the galaxy enters the cluster .",
    "also , most of the evolution can be predicted using a single parameter , the critical tidal density along the orbit ( eq . [ [ eq : rhotid ] ] ) .",
    "a testable prediction of the tidally - driven evolution is the preferential abundance of s0 galaxies in the middle of large clusters at the expense of the spirals .",
    "disk galaxies on the cluster periphery should have distorted profiles as well as the occasional spots of diminishing star formation .",
    "the abundance of elliptical galaxies , on the other hand , should be universal .",
    "these predictions are confirmed by observations @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of galaxies at various stages of their evolution in clusters by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite will further improve the observational picture .",
    "new hst images of the cluster cl 1358 + 62 @xcite show that the s0s are systematically bluer in the outer regions and may have formed stars more recently than the inner s0s .",
    "interestingly , the brightest blue galaxies are bulge - dominated .",
    "even though s0s are systematically less luminous than both ellipticals and spirals @xcite , their bulges may appear more prominent after star formation has ceased : the disks would dim by up to 2 mag , while the bulges would brighten due to the reduced extinction .",
    "these effects , however , may not be sufficient to explain the large bulges of s0s from the small bulges of sa - sc galaxies @xcite . therefore ,",
    "like the elliptical galaxies , most of the bulges had to accumulate at the early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "the most significant limitation of the present study is the absence of gas dynamics .",
    "future work should include a self - consistent treatment of the gas , both in the cluster and the galaxy simulations .",
    "parallel tree - sph codes should be able to address this issue , although the amount of computations is very large . also , high - resolution cluster simulations should help to resolve close galactic encounters . a nested grid method is necessary here , since the dynamical range should be extended by at least a factor of 10 , from 60 @xmath44 kpc to less than 5 @xmath44 kpc .",
    "adaptive mesh codes , such as amr @xcite , could reach the desired level but the computational expense is again not currently possible .",
    "the interpenetrating galaxy encounters may be responsible for the unexpected star formation episodes , such as in the `` e+a '' galaxies @xcite .",
    "i have used the high - resolution -body simulations to explore the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies in clusters .",
    "the evolution is driven by the tidal forces of the hierarchically forming clusters , extracted from the lower resolution simulations ( gnedin 2003 ) in three cosmological scenarios .",
    "i find that tidal effects are capable of inducing strong dynamical and morphological transformations , which can be parametrized by the critical tidal density along the galactic orbit . in the virgo - type clusters this tidal density is @xmath309 pc@xmath15 .",
    "\\(i ) disks of large spiral galaxies thicken by a factor of two to three , while the stellar velocity dispersion in outer regions rises to 100 km s@xmath3 . toomre s @xmath245 parameter increases to @xmath310 and even a large amount of cold gas is unable to make the disks gravitationally unstable .",
    "the gas in the outer regions can be stripped by ram pressure of the intracluster gas .",
    "however , the stellar surface density distribution remains similar to the initial .",
    "devoid of star formation these galaxies transform into the s0s , in agreement with the observations of low redshift clusters .",
    "\\(ii ) dark matter halos are truncated at @xmath4 kpc , for the initial circular velocity of 250 km s@xmath3 . in smaller halos",
    "the truncation radius is proportionately smaller , @xmath311 . as a result ,",
    "the galaxies with extended halos may lose most of their mass to the cluster .",
    "\\(iii ) low density ( dwarf spheroidal and low surface brightness ) galaxies entering the cluster may get completely disrupted by tidal shocks .",
    "the stripped material would stretch in long tidal streams along the original trajectories . according to the current faint galaxy surveys",
    ", the unbound stars of giant lsb galaxies may provide enough material for the diffuse intracluster light .",
    "\\(iv ) in all three cosmological models tidal heating is not limited to the cluster core and starts to affect galaxies as soon as they enter the cluster .",
    "the variation of the evolution on different orbits within the same cluster is as large as the variation due to the different cluster models .",
    "nevertheless , the epoch of cluster formation , the critical tidal densities , and the heating rates indicate that the low @xmath7 models produce stronger dynamical evolution of galaxies and agree with observations better than the @xmath0 model .",
