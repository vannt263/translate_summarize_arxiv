    "although planetary nebulae ( pns ) are usually assumed to have a simple spherical geometry , the actual morphologies of pns have diverse forms .",
    "when deeper , narrow - band observations are taken , pns often reveal outer structures such as lobes and haloes . while it has been recognized for some time that there are many examples of planetary nebulae with prominent bipolar structures ( e.g. , ngc 2346 , ngc 6302 ) , an increasing number of nebulae with multiple lobe structures have been found ( e.g. , ngc 2440 , ngc 6072 ) .",
    "the origin of such structures and the physical mechanisms leading to their formation are yet to be understood .    since pns are made up of ionized , molecular , and dust components , a comprehensive understanding of the dynamical processes that create the observed morphological structures can only be obtained with multiwavelength observations . with modern 8-m class telescopes equipped with high - resolution mid - infrared imaging capabilities ,",
    "the distribution of the dust component can be compared to the distribution of the ionized gas component with comparable resolution . in particular",
    ", the infrared observations will allow us to search for the existence of a high - density torus , and determine what role the torus play in the collimation of observed optical outflows .",
    "the pn ngc 6644 ( png 008.3 - 07.3 , hen 2 - 408 , vv 188 , iras 18295 - 2510 ) was discovered by @xcite .",
    "based on early ground - based imaging , this compact nebula has been classified as an elliptical pn by @xcite .",
    "it has a large heliocentric radial velocity of 205 km s@xmath0 , and is suggested as a pn in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argued that this object is not a galactic bulge pn based on their spectroscopic study .",
    "although ngc 6644 has a relatively high surface brightness , it has received very little attention in the literature .",
    "there are only three entries in ads on the object after a search of keywords in the abstract , and the papers are mostly related to abundance studies of the nebula .",
    "@xcite proposed that the object was made from a much less metal - rich mixture than the sun .    in this paper ,",
    "we present results of our morphological study for ngc 6644 based on optical and infrared images taken with _",

    "the total integration time of irs observation is 347 s. the irs measurement of ngc 6644 was not positioned at the central star but on the outer lobe .",

    "data were reduced starting with basic calibrated data ( bcd ) from the spitzer science center s pipeline version s18.7 and were run through the * irsclean * program to remove rogue pixels .",

    "a final spectrum was produced using the combined irs observations to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . since the irs spectrum in the short wavelength range is taken from the outside of the nebula , some scaling is needed for the shorter wavelength observations . in fig .",
    "[ volk ] , we scale the irs sh and sl observations by factors of 1.29 and 1.625 respectively and are able to obtain a smooth spectrum . when we compare these adjusted flux levels to the photometric measurements obtained from the 4 gemini t - recs filters , we find good agreement ( fig .

    "[ volk ] are the 4 gemini filter transmission functions .",
    "we can see that the [ s  iv ] and pah-2 filters have most of their fluxes contributed by the [ s  iv ] line and the 11.3 @xmath14 m aromatic infrared band ( aib ) respectively .",
    "the si-5 filter mainly takes in fluxes from the 12 @xmath14 m plateau emission feature and the @xmath11 filter measures the general dust continuum .",
    "although the @xmath11 filter covers the [ s  iii ] line , we estimate the line contribution to the filter flux to be @xmath158% and should not affect the observed morphology of the dust continuum .",
    "the _ hst _ h@xmath4 image of ngc 6644 reveals several morphological structures in the nebula ( fig .",

    "a ring structure ( labeled as `` ionized torus '' ) near the center can also be seen . beyond the bright ring ,",
    "there are associated nebulosities ( marked as `` @xmath18 '' ) , in particular in the western direction .",
    "it is possible that these nebulosities represent the projection of a third pair of lobes which are aligned nearly along the line of sight .",
    "an extended diffuse structure ( marked as `` halo '' ) can also be seen . in fig .  [ over ] , we display the image with the central part of the nebula saturated , allowing the fainter outer structures to be seen .",
    "there are apparently sub - structures in the nebula . in fig .",
    "[ nico2 ] , we mark a few possible sub - structures ( which appear predominantly in the north ) as @xmath19 .",
    "closer to the core of ngc 6644 appears several more sub - substructures , again most obvious in the northern part of the image .",
    "these are labeled @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ nico3 ] .",
    "the axes of these structures are defined by the caps of the lobes , location are marked by horizontal bars in figs .",
    "[ nico2 ] and [ nico3 ] .",
    "the orientation of the axis of @xmath21 is less well defined as the cap is not complete , but the others are reasonably well defined .",
    "what is interesting is that the axis @xmath22 seems to lie along the same orientation as @xmath21 , as well as the axes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the fact that these sub - structures appear stronger and more evident in the northern half of the image may provide further evidence that the north is tilted towards us and therefore experiences less extinction than the south .",
    "the symmetry axes of lobes @xmath25 and @xmath26 intersect approximately at the position of the central star .",
    "the two pairs of butterfly - shaped , closed - end bipolar lobes ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) have symmetry axes that lie at the position angles ( pas ) of -43 @xmath272@xmath28 and -27@xmath272@xmath28 , respectively .",

    ", the kinematic age of this lobe is @xmath15 521 yrs if the lobes lie close to the plane of the sky . from this kinematic age ,",
    "ngc 6644 can be considered as a young pn .",
    "for the central ring ( `` ionized torus '' ) , its major axis is found to have an angular orientation of pa @xmath15 -55@xmath273@xmath28 .",
    "similar structures have been found in other multipolar pns such as the two bright partial rings seen in the waist of he 2 - 47 ( * ? ? ?",
    "the eastern segment of the ring in ngc 6644 is brighter than the western side , as evident in both the h@xmath4 image ( fig .",
    "[ hst ] ) and in the [ s  iv ] image in fig .",
    "[ gemini ] .",
    "this suggests that the eastern segment is closer to us , whereas the western side suffers from extinction from intervening dust in the dust torus .",
    "this bright multipolar nebula is surrounded by a faint , extensive halo with a well - defined spherical shape .",
    "the extended halo emission at h@xmath4 can be seen in an averaged radial surface brightness profile ( with the two bipolar lobes excluded ) shown in fig .",
    "[ profile ] .",
    "this profile is constructed from measurements of 5  intervals between pa=25 - 85and pa=205 - 265 , after the removal of all field stars .",
    "the intensity of the nebula within 1.@xmath24 is dominated by the ionized torus and the angular radius of the faint halo is estimated to be larger than 4 .",
    "the surface brightness of the extended part at radius 4   relative to that in the peak is @xmath15 10@xmath31 . at a distance of 2.5 kpc ,",
    "the physical size of the halo is 0.15 light - yr , with a kinematic age of @xmath15 3@xmath3 10@xmath32 yr , if the expansion velocity of the halo is 15 km s@xmath0 .",
    "an intensity profile of the nebula ( minus the lobes ) averaged over all angles is shown in fig .",
    "[ profile ] . also shown is a fit of the profile by a halo density distribution of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the radial distance from the central star , with an inner and outer radii of @xmath35 and 6.5 arc sec respectively .",
    "for the modeling , we have assumed that h@xmath4 is optically thin and its intensity integrated along each line of sight is proportional to the emission measure , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the density of hydrogen ion , @xmath38 is the angular distance from the central star , and @xmath39 is the path length element along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , under the assumption that the halo is a spherical shell , we have    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and 0 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , and @xmath44 . for a stellar wind with a constant mass - loss rate and expansion velocity",
    ", @xmath4 has a value of 2 and the density distribution varies as @xmath45 .",
    "while the model provides a reasonably good fit to the halo , it fails in the inner region .    in a second model",
    ", we introduce a face - on torus with a cross - section radius of @xmath46 and a homogeneous density distribution of @xmath47 . for the torus",
    ", we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the distance from the circle center of the torus to the central star .",
    "the torus is embedded in a halo with a inner radius of 1 arc sec .",
    "this addition makes an improved fit to the intensity profile in the central region .",
    "the remaining excess in emission between 1 and 2 arc sec ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ profile ] ) could be due to emission from the nearly pole - on lobes .    in the model",
    ", we do not consider the effect of extinction .",
    "due to the presence of dust torus ( see below ) , the central region may have a higher extinction than the halo .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath50 given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) could be underestimated and the actual intensity of the inner region would be even higher .",
    "this will further strengthen the need for a face - on torus .      in fig .",
    "[ gemini ] we show the 4-band t - recs ( pah-2 , si-5 , [ s  iv ] , and @xmath11 ) flux - calibrated images in units of jy per square arcsecond .",
    "the t - recs images of ngc 6644 were each deconvolved using the observations of the standard star hd 175775 taken immediately after the science observations .",
    "the `` lucy '' task in the `` analysis '' group of the `` stsci '' external iraf package was used for the deconvolutions . for each filter",
    "a background - subtracted , normalized psf image of size 51 by 51 pixels was created from the standard star observation , and this was used as the kernel for the deconvolution .",
    "the deconvolution was iterated 25 times to produce the final deconvolved images .",
    "it was found that most of the improvement in the images took place within the first 5 to 10 iterations . under the seeing conditions reported in section [ trecs ] ,",
    "the lucy deconvolution is robust to small changes in the fwhm of the psf .",
    "the deconvolved images are shown in fig .",
    "[ decon ] together with the h@xmath4 image on the same scale .    from figs .",
    "[ gemini ] and [ decon ] , we can clearly see that there is a spatially resolved structure in the central region of ngc 6644 .",
    "the [ s  iv ] image shows a partial ring structure similar to that seen in the central region in the h@xmath4 image , suggesting that they both trace the ionized gas distribution .",
    "the si5 and pah2 images are different from the [ s  iv ] image , showing a double - peaked structure .",
    "the @xmath11 image shows a more diffuse structure than the other 3 images .",
    "the overall maximum angular extent of the emission regions in the four images are similar .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the _ hst _ h@xmath4 image with the _ gemini _ [ s  iv ] image shows that the ring in the [ s  iv ] image is less complete than its counterpart in the h@xmath4 image ( fig .",
    "[ decon ] ) .",
    "there are two factors that can cause a difference between the two images .",
    "the [ s  iv ] image includes contributions from both the [ s  iv ] line and dust continuum , and therefore should reflect the morphology of the ionized torus as well as the oblique dust torus . since the dust torus",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ gemini ] ) is brighter in the eastern side , the [ s  iv ] image should therefore appear as a less complete ring than in the h@xmath4 image .",
    "if there is also effect of local extinction that causes the eastern side to be brighter ( see section [ lobes ] ) , then the [ s  iv ] image should suffer from less extinction and therefore should show a more complete ring .",
    "this effect is apparently not as important .",
    "if the double - peaked structure in the pah2 and si5 filter images is interpreted as an oblique torus , the size of the torus has dimensions of 28 @xmath3 15 pixels with the major axis lying along pa @xmath15 -44@xmath273@xmath28 .",
    "this translates to a major axis size of 2@xmath1352 and a minor axis size of 1@xmath1335 .",
    "assuming that this ellipse is a projection of a circle on the sky , an angle of tilt of the dust torus is approximately 32@xmath28 ( with 90@xmath28 being pole on ) .",
    "the fact that this torus is not obvious in the optical image is probably because the dust torus is optically thick to the uv photons and the volume of the torus is not ionized .    in table 3",
    ", we compare the fluxes observed in the four band t - recs observations and fluxes from the irs observations .",

    "the simulated t - recs in - band fluxes derived from the irs spectrum and the filter profiles of the 4 bands are given in column 5 .",
    "there is general consistency between the gemini and irs measurements with the discrepancies being due to varying sky conditions and uncertainty of photometric flux calibrations .",
    "these uncertainties are higher in the @xmath11 band .",
    "the combined irs spectrum of ngc 6644 shown in ( fig .  [ volk ] ) shows a strong infrared continuum due to dust emission peaking at @xmath15 30 @xmath8 . on top of this continuum",

    "after correcting the uv spectrum and optical measurements by an extinction value of 0.41 @xcite ( which accounts for both circumstellar and interstellar extinction ) , we fitted the emerging flux ( @xmath56 ) by a three - component model including a hot central star , a warm gaseous nebula , and a cool dust shell @xcite .",
    "the hot stellar component is assumed to be a blackbody of temperature @xmath57 .",

    "this may suggest that the visible nebulosity ( from which we estimate the kinematic age ) originates from very late stellar winds , and observations with higher sensitivity are required to detect the fainter extended structures .",
    "the near - ir photometry points suggest that there is excess emission between 2 and 5 @xmath14 m which could be due to a cool companion , a hot dust component , or scattering from an unseen disk .",

    ", we can see that there is a broad 30 @xmath8 feature in ngc 6644 .",
    "this unidentified emission feature is commonly seen in carbon stars @xcite , post - agb stars @xcite and young pns .",
    "the observations of ngc 6644 as reported in section [ lobes ] suggest that ngc 6644 is a new member in the club of multipolar nebulae .",
    "the class of multipolar nebulae , first described by @xcite and @xcite , now include many prominent members including ngc 2440 @xcite , he 2 - 47 and m1 - 37 @xcite , he 2 - 113 @xcite , ngc 6881 @xcite , ngc 6072 @xcite , etc .",
    "multipolar nebulae , having a point - symmetric rather than axial symmetric structure , need 3-d modelling to visualize their structure . with this aim ,",
    "we have constructed a schematic model of ngc 6644 assuming three pairs of bipolar lobes and an equatorial dust torus using the software program shape @xcite .",
    "shape is a morpho - kinematic modeling tool intended for the analysis of the 3d geometry and kinematic structure of gaseous nebulae .",
    "shape uses both kinematic and spatial observations as a guide for the interactive reproduction of model nebulae . once",
    "a 3d model has been constructed , parameters such as position angle and inclination can be manipulated in order to study the object from different orientations . in this work",
    "we are interested in studying the complex 3d morphology of multi - polar pn for which shape is an ideal tool .",
    "we do not attempt to determine physical parameters such as the temperature and density structure and thus we do not perform any radiative transfer or hydrodynamic simulations . instead , the brightness and location of each component is assigned based on the qualitative analysis of the observed images .",
    "in addition to the observed double bipolar lobes @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 , we hypothesize an additional pair of lobes that is perpendicular to the observed ionized torus in fig .",
    "this pair of lobes will be referred to as lobe @xmath18 .",
    "we further assume that all three pairs of lobes are equal in length and that the @xmath26 lobes are oriented in the plane of the sky ( inclination 0@xmath28 ) . with these assumptions",
    ", we can then derive an inclination of 31@xmath28 and -85@xmath28 for the @xmath25 and @xmath18 lobes respectively .",
    "the estimated symmetry axes of these three lobes are along pa= -42 , -28  and 76  for the @xmath87 and @xmath18 lobes respectively .",
    "we created a dense torus as the counterpart of the infrared torus seen in the gemini si5 and pah2 images with a center that coincides with that of the three lobes .",
    "if we assume that the observed elliptical torus is a tilted circular disk , then the model s major - to - minor axis ratio implies an inclination angle of 35@xmath28 ( with 90@xmath28 being pole on ) .",
    "this value is in reasonable agreement with our previous estimate of 32@xmath28 based on the ellipticity of the torus ( see @xmath1 3.2 ) . in this model ,",
    "the symmetry axis of lobe @xmath16 is perpendicular to the infrared dust torus .",
    "a counterpart of the ring seen in the _ hst _ h@xmath4 image and the gemini [ s  iv ] image is also included .",
    "the model parameters of these structures are listed in table 6 and a schematic mesh model is shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "this simple model can provide insight into what multipolar pns look like at different orientations . in fig .",
    "[ shape ] we present a three - dimensional representation of ngc 6644 viewed from different angles .",
    "the bottom left image is the model as seen from earth , and the orientations of the other images are as labeled .",
    "the @xmath88 and @xmath89 axes indicated are those of the image plane and the values represent rotations around those axes in degrees .    when @xmath89 = 90@xmath28 , the nebula reveals three distinct pairs of lobes with an elliptical disk .",
    "this form is similar to that found in two young pns , he 2 - 47 and m 1 - 37 @xcite .",
    "= 0@xmath28 the bipolar lobes appear closer together and overlap to varying extents .",
    "this type of structure is seen , for example , in ngc 6072 @xcite and the frosty leo nebula @xcite .",
    "the present model illustrates the possible complex 3-d structures that may be present in other objects and indeed it would be difficult to visualize the structure of ngc 6644 without the aid of such a model .",
    "the main purpose of this simulation is to show how complex the structure of a multipolar pn can be and not as a quantitative fit to the observations .",
    "a proper model of a complex object such as ngc 6644 will require kinematic information from all of the morphological features , which can be provided by integral field spectroscopy with large optical telescopes .",
    "although ngc 6644 appears to be a typical elliptical nebula , high angular resolution and dynamical range optical observations reveal that it in fact has an extremely complicated structure . from _",
    "hst _ and _ gemini _ observations , we have identified at least two pairs of bipolar lobes and an infrared dust torus . the orientation of the dust torus is approximately perpendicular to one pair of the lobes .",
    "in addition , there is a ring of ionized gas lying almost on the plane of the sky .",
    "we suggest that there could be a 3rd pair of bipolar lobes whose axis is perpendicular to this ring .",
    "several other faint sublobes at different radial distances and angular directions can also be seen .",
    "it is clear that ngc 6644 is a multipolar nebula . in order to illustrate its possible 3-d structure ,",
    "we have constructed a model to show what it may look like when viewed from different perspectives .",
    "its simulated rotated images resemble some other multi - polar nebulae , suggesting that nebulae with different appearances may have similar intrinsic structures .",
    "the emergence of the class of multipolar nebulae has greatly altered our perception of the morphological structures of pns .",
    "the commonly assumed simple structures of pns are probably the result of inadequate sensitivity and spatial resolution imaging .",
    "deep imaging of pns is needed to reveal the true intrinsic structures of pns .",
