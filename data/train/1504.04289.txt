    "stochastic modeling of molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) attracted much interest in the last decades due to the importance of this technique to produce high quality thin films for many applications @xcite .",
    "those models adopt simple rules for the aggregation , diffusion , and desorption processes , consequently allowing the study of morphological properties of large samples @xcite . in the simplest cases , they assume limited mobility ( lm ) of adatoms ; some examples are the models of wolf and villain @xcite and of das sarma and tamborenea @xcite , in which short - range surface diffusion and permanent aggregation take place immediatly after adsorption .",
    "more realistic models consider thermally activated microscopic processes and are frequently called colletive diffusion models .",
    "the most prominent example is the clarke - vvedensky ( cv ) model @xcite , in which the adatom diffusion coefficients have arrhenius forms , with energy barriers depending on the local number of lattice neighbors .",
    "an important difference from lm models is that the cv model obeys detailed balance conditions , thus it may also be a reliable description of the film dynamics without deposition @xcite .    in the basic formulation of the cv model , the dynamics",
    "may be represented by temperature - like parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively representing the diffusion - to - deposition ratio of isolated atoms in terraces and the detachment probability at step edges @xcite . for the description of specific mbe processes , at submonolayer or multilayer regime , the models usually include additional energy barriers for diffusion across step edges ( upward and downward movements ) and additional adatom interactions ; a thorough review of homoepitaxy applications is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and recent advance is discussed in refs .",
    "the formation of patterns , growth and coarsening of mounds were some of the features that attracted much interest .    however , a small number of works analyzed the dynamic scaling of surface roughness in cv - type models .",
    "this analysis provides a set of scaling exponents connecting the model to stochastic growth equations @xcite , which helps to distinguish the essential physico - chemical mechanisms of film growth .",
    "initial works on the basic cv model suggested temperature - dependent exponents and anomalous scaling of surface roughness @xcite .",
    "subsequently , renormalization studies @xcite suggested that it belongs to the class of the villain - lai - das sarma ( vlds ) growth equation @xcite . in @xmath12 dimensions , vlds scaling",

    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a systematic investigation of dynamic scaling in the basic cv model ( without additional barriers across edges ) , with particular attention on the role of the temperature - like parameters .",
    "first , we study the scaling of global and local surface roughness and confirm that it belongs to the vlds class for a broad range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "deviations from this scaling are shown to appear only when the surfaces are very flat .",
    "second , we will show evidence of asymptotic normal scaling , but with an apparent anomaly for short times and small @xmath1 similar to other vlds models @xcite .",
    "finally , we will show that the roughness scales with @xmath1 in a form similar to the irreversible aggregation model , with a weak dependence on the step detachment rate @xmath2 .",
    "although this model without barriers at step edges is of limited applicability to real solid films , these results may help the analysis of dynamic scaling in extended versions of the cv model , particularly if crossover features have to be analyzed .",

    "the cv model is defined in a simple cubic lattice , with an initially flat substrate at @xmath15 .",
    "deposition occurs with a flux of @xmath16 atoms per site per unit time , in the @xmath17 direction towards the substrate .",
    "each adatom occupies one lattice site , whose side is taken as the unit length .",
    "we impose the solid - on - solid condition ( i. e. overhangs are not allowed ) , thus only adatoms at the top of each substrate column are mobile .",
    "the hopping rate of an adatom with no lateral neighbor is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a frequency , @xmath20 is an activation energy , and @xmath21 is the temperature .",
    "the adatom step occurs in a randomly chosen substrate direction ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , towards the top of a nn column . if an adatom has @xmath24 lateral neighbors , its hopping rate is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a bond energy .",
    "an important parameter of the model is the diffusion - to - deposition ratio @xmath27 it is usually interpreted as the number of steps of an adatom in a terrace before it is buried by the next atomic layer . however , it is highly probable that an adatom meets a lateral neighbor before being buried , which restricts that interpretation @xcite . in the original cv model , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the planck s constant , as predicted by transition state theory @xcite .",
    "some authors adopted that form @xcite , but it is more frequent that a constant value @xmath30 is considered in simulation and analytical works @xcite . here",

    "larger values are expected in many mbe processes , but we will show that they produce very smooth surfaces up to the maximal simulated thicknesses .",
