    "for a simple , undirected , connected graph @xmath2 its _ square _ @xmath3 is the graph on the same vertex set in which two distinct vertices are adjacent if their distance in @xmath2 is at most @xmath4 . in this case",
    "@xmath2 is called the _ square root _ of @xmath5 . also , recall that the _ girth _ of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle ( or @xmath6 for a tree ) .",
    "the neighbourhood @xmath7 of @xmath8 will be the set consisting of @xmath8 and its adjacent vertices in @xmath2 . by @xmath9",
    "we denote the distance between two vertices in @xmath2 .",
    "we investigate the uniqueness of square roots of graphs .",
    "ross and harary @xcite proved the following theorem :    * if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two trees such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are isomorphic , then @xmath10 and @xmath11 are isomorphic .",
    "this was recently improved by farzad et al .",
    "@xcite who proved :    * if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two graphs of girth at least @xmath1 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are isomorphic , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are isomorphic .    in the next section",
    "we prove the best possible result , which is :    * if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two graphs of girth at least @xmath0 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are isomorphic , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are isomorphic .",
    "the key idea behind ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is that each maximal clique of the square corresponds to the neighbourhood of some vertex in the root .",
    "this fails in the case of roots of girth @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the vertices @xmath18 of the cycle @xmath19 form a maximal clique in @xmath20 even though they do not induce a star in @xmath19 .",
    "this is where we will need a new idea to prove ( 3 ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph of girth at least @xmath0 on the vertex set @xmath21 and let @xmath3 .",
    "we have the following easy observations :    * if there is a path from @xmath8 to @xmath22 in @xmath2 of length exactly @xmath23 , then @xmath24 ( otherwise there would be a cycle in @xmath2 of length at most @xmath25 ) . * if @xmath26 then @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the inclusion @xmath28 is obvious . to prove @xmath29 note that if some vertex @xmath30 was adjacent to neither @xmath8 nor @xmath22 in @xmath2 , then it would be in distance @xmath4 from both of them , which would yield a 5-cycle in @xmath2 .",
    "we start with a lemma which can also be deduced from @xcite .",
    "the notation @xmath31 means that two graphs are equal ( the same vertex set and the same edges ) , not just isomorphic .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be graphs of girth at least @xmath0 on the vertex set @xmath21 .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 and that @xmath33 are three vertices such that @xmath34 is a path in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 . then @xmath31 .",
    "[ lemma : easy ]    let @xmath2 be any graph of girth at least 6 such that @xmath3 .",
    "the following statements follow easily from ( * ) and ( * * ) :    * if @xmath35 is a path in @xmath2 , then ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] ) @xmath36 +   and @xmath37 in @xmath2 . ] * if @xmath37 is of degree @xmath38 in @xmath2 and @xmath39 then @xmath40    with the above formulas , given one path @xmath34 of @xmath2 one can recursively compute all the edges of @xmath2 using only the information from @xmath5 , so the square root of @xmath5 with this distinguished path is unique .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "clearly , it suffices to prove our main result with the assumption `` @xmath16 and @xmath17 are isomorphic '' replaced by `` @xmath41 '' .",
    "this is what we now prove :    [ theorem:6iso ] suppose @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two graphs of girth at least @xmath0 such that @xmath32 . then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are isomorphic .",
    "let @xmath21 be the common vertex set of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath34 is a path in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 for some @xmath42 then @xmath31 by the previous lemma . therefore we may assume that for every @xmath22 the set @xmath43 has at most 1 element .",
    "define the following map @xmath44 :    * if @xmath45 then @xmath46 , * if @xmath47 then @xmath48 is the unique element of @xmath49 .    clearly @xmath50 is an involution .",
    "we shall first prove two statements :    * \\(a ) if @xmath51 , @xmath47 and @xmath52 then @xmath53 , * \\(b ) if @xmath51 and @xmath45 then @xmath54",
    ".    _ proof of ( a ) .",
    "_ let @xmath22 be a vertex with @xmath47 and let @xmath55 , meaning that @xmath56 is an edge in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "we will show that @xmath53 .",
    "suppose , on the contrary , that @xmath58 ( fig.[fig:6 ] . ) .",
    "then @xmath59 , so , by ( * ) , @xmath60 . since @xmath8 and @xmath22 are not neighbours in @xmath15 , but @xmath61 , the property ( * * ) implies that @xmath62 is an edge in @xmath15",
    ". however @xmath63 is also an edge in @xmath15 , so @xmath64 .",
    "this contradiction proves that @xmath53 for all neighbours @xmath8 of @xmath22 in @xmath14 other than @xmath57 .    .",

    "the vertex @xmath22 must be in distance @xmath4 from @xmath8 , so there is an @xmath65 such that @xmath66 is a path in @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , @xmath67 , so by ( * * ) we have @xmath68 .",
    "this is a contradiction since @xmath65 would be adjacent to either @xmath8 or @xmath22 in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which is impossible by @xmath69 .",
    "_ proof of the theorem .",
    "_ now we prove that @xmath50 ( treated as a map of graphs @xmath70 ) maps edges to edges .",
    "let @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath71 then , by ( a ) , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 is an edge in both graphs , so @xmath50 takes @xmath74 to an edge @xmath75 in @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath47 , then let @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 and @xmath61 , we have from ( * * ) that @xmath78 and @xmath50 takes @xmath51 to @xmath79 .",
    "the case @xmath80 is not possible by ( b ) .    to prove that @xmath81 maps edges to edges one simply inverts the roles of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the above argument ( the definition of @xmath50 was symmetric with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath50 is an isomorphism .",
    "this result is optimal in the sense that it can not hold for girth at least @xmath25 because @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath83-th power @xmath84 of a graph is defined analogously , that is edges in @xmath84 correspond to pairs of vertices in distance at most @xmath83 in @xmath2 .",
    "observe that regardless of the girth restriction , there can be no analogous general result for higher graph powers , because there exist non - isomorphic trees whose @xmath83-th power is a complete graph for all @xmath85 .",
    "this and the work of @xcite suggest that one may benefit from forbidding vertices of degree one in the root . consider the following problem : what are the minimal values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 for which the following statements hold :    * for any two graphs @xmath14 and @xmath15 of girth at least @xmath86 with no vertices of degree one , if @xmath88 then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are isomorphic . * for any two graphs @xmath14 and @xmath15 of girth at least @xmath87 with no vertices of degree one , if @xmath88 then @xmath31 .",
    "for example @xmath89 , as proved in @xcite .",
    "our work proves that @xmath90 and this is , in fact , optimal : there exist two non - isomorphic graphs of girth @xmath25 and no degree one vertices having the same squares .",
    "the smallest such example is a pair of graphs on @xmath91 vertices shown in fig.[fig:2 ] ( found with @xcite )",
