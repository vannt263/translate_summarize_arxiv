    "radio - frequency ( rf ) signal based wireless power transfer ( wpt ) provides a viable solution by deploying dedicated energy transmitters to broadcast energy wirelessly@xcite .",
    "recently , emerging wireless powered communication networks ( wpcns ) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) paradigms have been proposed to achieve ubiquitous wireless communications in a self - sustainable way@xcite , where wpt and wireless communications are combined into a joint design .",
    "motivated by these approaches , in this paper we pursue a joint design of wpt and mec to facilitate self - sustainable computing for a large number of mobile devices by considering wireless powered _ multiuser _ mec systems .",
    "we consider a wireless powered multiuser mec system consisting of a multi - antenna ap and multiple users .",
    "each user is equipped with two antennas : one for wpt and the other for computation offloading .",
    "these two antennas operate over different frequency bands such that wpt and computation offloading can be performed simultaneously without co - channel interference .",

    "the computation task per user needs to be accomplished within the block .",
    "we assume the computation bits can be arbitrarily partitioned to be computed separately and each user can perform local computing and offloading at the same time .",
    "we also consider a time division multiple access ( tdma ) protocol , where computation offloading per user is executed within an orthogonally allocated time slot . under this setup ,",
    "we pursue an energy - efficient wireless powered mec system design by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamformer at the ap , the central processing unit ( cpu ) frequency and the offloaded bits at each user , as well as the tdma time allocation among different users . in particular , we minimize the energy consumption over a particular time block at the ap subject to the computation latency and energy harvesting constraints per user . by formulating this problem into a convex framework and leveraging the lagrange duality method , we obtain its optimal solution in a semi - closed form .",
    "numerical results show that the proposed joint design enjoys substantial performance gains over alternative baseline schemes in terms of the achieved energy efficiency .",
    "note that in the literature , a wireless powered single - user mec system was considered in @xcite , where the user s computation task can only be fully offloaded to the mec server or completely executed locally , with no partial offloading allowed .",
    "the objective is to maximize the probability of successful computing at the mobile device subject to its energy harvesting and computation latency constraints .",

    "it is assumed that the wpt and the wireless communications ( for offloading ) are operated over orthogonal frequency bands simultaneous without co - channel interference .",
    "the ap is assumed to be equipped with @xmath2 antennas , each of which can transmit energy signals in the downlink and receive the offloading signals in the uplink simultaneously over different frequency bands . each user is equipped with two antennas : one connecting to the energy harvesting circuit to harvest wireless energy from the ap and the other connecting to information transceivers to communicate with the ap ( including offloading tasks and receiving computed results ) .",

    "it is assumed that the ap knows the perfect channel state information from / to the @xmath0 users , as well as the perfect computation information of all the @xmath0 users .",
    "suppose that user @xmath4 has a computation task with @xmath5 input bits , which can either be computed locally by itself , or remotely computed at the mec server via offloading . in practice , the computation task can be separated into various modules and computed in a distributed manner @xcite .",

    "practically , the ap with an integrated mec server could provide sufficient cpu capability and high transmit power , while the computation results are usually of small sizes .",

    "as the ap and its integrated mec server are supposed to have sufficient communication and computation capacities , we assume that it consumes constant large receive / transmit power levels and a constant high cpu frequency to minimize the communication and computation time .",

    "i.e. , @xmath144 it implies that if the energy harvesting constraint is not tight for user @xmath4 ( i.e. , user @xmath4 harvests sufficient wireless energy ) , no computation offloading is required and user @xmath4 computes all the tasks locally .",
    "this is intuitive : when the user has sufficient energy to accomplish the tasks locally , there is no need to employ computation offloading that can incur additional energy consumption at the ap .",
    "* next , if @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 ( see ( [ eq.opt_l ] ) ) , which is due to the non - zero energy consumption related to @xmath45 at the mec server , together with the fact that @xmath147 ( see ( [ eq.opt_r ] ) ) . in other words , offloading all the bits to the ap is always suboptimal in this case .",
    "this is because the marginal energy consumption of local computing is nearly zero when @xmath148 .",
    "it is then always beneficial to leave some bits for local computing .",
    "interestingly , ( [ eq.opt_l ] ) further show that a larger @xmath149 admits a larger @xmath150 and a smaller @xmath151 , leading to a larger @xmath152 allocated for user  @xmath4 .",
    "this means that more stringent the energy harvesting constraint is , more bits should be offloaded . *",
    "finally , the offloading bit number @xmath6 and the offloading rate @xmath153 for user @xmath4 are affected by the channel gain @xmath154 , the block length @xmath3 , the circuit power @xmath36 , and the mec energy consumption @xmath45 per offloaded bit in the following way : 1 ) when the channel condition becomes better ( i.e. , @xmath154 becomes larger ) , user @xmath4 is more likely to offload more bits with a higher offloading rate ; 2 ) a higher circuit power @xmath155 at the user leads to a higher offloading rate ; 3 ) when @xmath3 or @xmath45 increases , fewer bits are offloaded over the uplink .",

    "[ fig.perf_vs_r ] , the full offloading scheme outperforms the local computing one especially when @xmath177 becomes large .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath177 values , it is desirable to offload a large proportion of computation tasks to the ap to improve the system energy efficiency .",
    "as expected , the baseline full offloading scheme achieves a near - optimal performance as with the proposed one for large @xmath177 . due to the loss of multi - antenna array gain ,",

    "however , when @xmath3 increases , the energy consumption for the full offloading scheme remains almost unchanged .",
    "this suggests that there exists some critical value for the time block length to enable energy saving for full offloading .",
    "by contrast , the energy consumption of the local computing only scheme is observed to decrease significantly as @xmath3 increases .",
    "this is because as @xmath3 increases , we could lower down the cpu frequency such that the power consumption for local computing becomes smaller than that for offloading at each user . for a large @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xmath183 s ) , the local computing scheme outperforms the full offloading scheme , and even approaches the optimal performance with @xmath184  s.",
    "in this paper , we investigated the joint offloading and computing design in emerging wireless powered multiuser mec systems .",
    "we developed a new energy - efficient design principle for the ap to minimize its energy consumption while maintaining the self - sustainable computation at mobile devices , by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamformer at the ap , the local cpu frequency and the offloaded bits for each user , as well as the tdma time allocation among different users .",
    "leveraging the lagrange duality method , we obtained the optimal solution in a semi - closed form .",
    "numerical results demonstrated the benefit of the proposed design over alternative baseline schemes in terms of the achieved energy efficiency .",
    "first , consider the case when there exists some user @xmath4 with @xmath185 , which implies that user @xmath4 offloads all of its computation task bits to the ap .",
    "clearly , user @xmath4 does not perform local computing ; hence , the local cpu frequency of user @xmath4 is zero .",

    "since that both @xmath188 and @xmath189 are convex functions with respect to @xmath190 , based on jensen s inequality@xcite , it follows that @xmath191 where both equalities in ( [ eq.c ] ) hold if and only if @xmath192 as a result , the optimality of problem @xmath67 is achieved when ( [ eq.eqn_eqn ] ) holds .",
