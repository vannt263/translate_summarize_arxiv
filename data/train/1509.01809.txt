    "the coupling is realized via a two - photon microwave and radio frequency ( rf ) transition with rabi frequency @xmath0 .",

    "<S> we access two axes of the phase space by measuring particle number difference with and without a final @xmath49 pulse , corresponding to readout of the @xmath21 and the @xmath20 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the undriven system shows a moderate broadening of the distribution along both axes ( fig.3 , upper panels ) . in the driven system , starting in the chaotic region we find fast broadening , eventually covering large parts of the phase space along the @xmath21 direction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , by starting in the vicinity of the moving island , the distribution remains confined within the observation time and disperses even less than in the undriven system @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the variance increases in the vicinity of the hyperbolic periodic orbit and is minimal ( compressed compared to the undriven case ) in the regular region close to the elliptic periodic orbit . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior is found for the strongly perturbed system with a strong increase of variance in the chaotic region and a sudden drop when approaching the sticky regions close to the moving island . </S>",
    "<S> this drop occurs within 3.5 widths of a minimal uncertainty state ( css ) and demonstrates the high experimental resolution of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the observations are in good agreement with the simulation ( fig.4 , solid black line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiments reveal that the mixed phase - space structure of a driven system can be probed even in the short time dynamics of just a few driving periods by a variance analysis of the quantum states . </S>",
