    "a series of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite works have identified that the dominating decoherence mechanism for electron spin qubits at low temperatures ( such as below a few kelvins ) is the entanglement with nuclear spins of the host lattice.@xcite    when the qubit flip is suppressed ( usually by the large zeeman energy mismatch between qubit and bath spins in a moderate magnetic field ) , the hamiltonian for a qubit - bath system has the general form @xmath0 the bath dynamics is driven by different hamiltonians @xmath1 depending on the qubit states @xmath2 . for a given initial bath state @xmath3 ( which could be a random sampling from a thermal ensemble ) , the qubit coherence at time @xmath4 is characterized by the `` single - sample '' propagator @xmath5 . for a thermal ensemble of bath states characterized by a density matrix @xmath6 , a further ensemble average should be processed and the qubit coherence is given by the ensemble average @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "in general , the key is to evaluate the ensemble - averaged propagator @xmath8 for a general density matrix @xmath6 and arbitrary bath interaction operators @xmath9 . to address this problem ,",

    "the linked - cluster expansion accurately takes into account higher - order correlations with a feynman diagram method , which , however , becomes dramatically tedious with increasing the order of diagrams .",
    "the density matrix cluster expansion simplifies the evaluation of higher - order correlations , but it may not converge to the exact results for relatively small baths.@xcite    very recently , we have developed a cluster - correlation expansion ( cce ) theory@xcite for the evaluation of the single - sample propagator @xmath10 , which is a special case of the ensemble - averaged propagator in eq .",

    "such an initial ensemble is factorizable and a sampling @xmath15 from the ensemble can be taken as a product state @xmath16 of all constituent bath spins , where @xmath17 denotes the zeeman energy eigen state of the @xmath18th bath spin . for a large spin bath",
    ", previous study@xcite has shown that the qubit decoherence is insensitive to the random sampling of the initial bath state from a thermal ensemble since the statistical fluctuation scales with the number of bath spins @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "thus the ensemble dynamics can be just identified with the single - sample dynamics with a random choice of the initial state.@xcite for a relatively small bath , however , the single - sample dynamics could be sensitive to the sampling of the initial state and the ensemble average can be very different from any single sample .",
    "more importantly , if the initial state of the bath is entangled , i.e. , @xmath21 for any choice of probability distribution @xmath22 and single spin density matrices @xmath23 , the single - sample cce is not applicable . to extend to general ensemble bath dynamics",
    ", one could simply use the monte carlo simulation with a sufficiently large random sampling of the initial states from the ensemble .",

    "( [ l_ens_single ] ) with all interaction terms in @xmath86 dropped . in order to incorporate the interaction effects ,",
    "the lowest nontrivial order of truncation is the second order ( 2-cce ) , @xmath87 which coincides with the pair - correlation approximation.@xcite    since only connected clusters for which @xmath88 contribute to the propagator @xmath81 , the convergence ( and hence the justification for the truncation ) of the ensemble cce can be estimated as follows .",
