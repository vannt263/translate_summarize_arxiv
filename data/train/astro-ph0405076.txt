    "information on possible transformation relations between the galaxies in the different classes may be gleaned from the morphology - radius ( mr ) and , in particular , the morphology - density ( md ) relation ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dressler 1980 ) ) .",
    "for the enacs clusters those have been discussed by @xcite , who considered ellipticals ( including the brightest ) and s0 galaxies separately , in addition to the s - early- and s - late - classes .",
    "the mr - relations show the dependence on radius of the composition in terms of morphology , and are fully consistent with the @xmath5 s in the upper panel of fig .  1 .",
    "the md - relation gives the distribution of local projected density around galaxies of the different classes .",
    "@xcite first used the original definition of projected density , i.e. that based on the 10 nearest neigbours , or @xmath12 .",
    "however , @xmath12 contains a very noticeable print - through of the average relation between projected density and radius . as a result",
    ", the @xmath12 md - relation is highly correlated with the mr - relation ( and thus , with the @xmath13 ) .",
    "the ellipticals prefer the highest densities , and the remaining three classes have indistinguishable @xmath12 distributions shifted towards lower densities ( left - hand panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "from this perspective , the s0 galaxies and ellipticals behave differently ; part of this difference is due to the brightest ellipticals being located at the clusters centres .",
    "@xcite also used @xmath14 , i.e. the projected density based on the distance to the nearest neighbour . as expected",
    ", @xmath14 is much noisier than @xmath12 , but at the same time it is much less correlated with projected radius , and therefore a less biased measure of local projected density than @xmath12 .",
    "that is probably the reason why the @xmath14-distributions of s0 and s - early galaxies are significantly different , with s0 galaxies preferring higher densities than the s - early galaxies ( right - hand panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "( left ) and @xmath14 ( right ) . ]",
    "for a study of the kinematics of the various galaxy classes , we have used the observed projected distributions @xmath5 and velocity dispersion profiles ( vdp s , hereafter ) .",
    "the vdp s of the five different classes are quite different ( see right - hand panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the bright - class vdp is quite ` cold ' , not only in the cluster centre .",
    "the early - class vdp is nearly flat .",
    "the vdp s of the s - early and the s - late classes are rather similar , showing a steep decline from the centre out to @xmath15 , followed by a nearly flat vdp .",
    "however , the s - late vdp is ` hotter ' than the s - early vdp at all radii .",
    "finally , the vdp of the subs - class is cold and flat , even flatter than the early - class vdp .    in order to determine the kinematics of the different galaxy classes we first need to determine the gravitational potential in which the galaxies move .",
    "we have therefore first derived the mass - profile @xmath16 , using the data for the early - class galaxies , assuming that those have an isotropic distribution of orbits .",
    "that assumption is justified by the shape of their line - of - sight velocity distribution , from which @xcite concluded that , for the early - class @xmath17 , with @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the mean squared components of the radial and tangential velocity , respectively ( i.e. isotropic orbits correspond to @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore the cluster mass profile , @xmath16 , follows from the _ isotropic _ jeans equation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* binney & tremaine 1987 ) ) applied to the early - class .",
    "the resulting @xmath16 is rather similar to a nfw ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* navarro et al . 1997 ) ) profile with a concentration parameter @xmath22 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* katgert et al .",
    "2004 ) ) .",
    "next , this cluster @xmath16 was used to search for solutions of dynamical equilibrium for the other four classes ( see   [ s - intro ] ) .",
    "given the cluster @xmath16 and the observed number density profile of a given class of cluster galaxies , one can solve the inverse jeans equation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel 1994 ) ) for a given @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting vdp is then compared , after the usual abel projection ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* binney & tremaine 1987 ) ) , with the observed line - of - sight vdp , in a @xmath24 sense .",
    "if the two vdp s are statistically indistinguishable , the @xmath23 profile is considered acceptable . instead of considering complicated @xmath23 profiles , we tested whether the data were consistent with an isotropic orbit distribution for the other galaxy classes , i.e. if @xmath21 is acceptable .",
    "this appears to be the case for galaxies of the s - early class , but not for those of the bright , s - late , and subs classes .",
    ", of the s - early class .",
    "the hatched region represents the approximate 1-@xmath9 confidence interval .",
    "mid panel : same as top panel , but for the s - late class .",
    "bottom panel : same as top panel , but for the subs class .",
    "the dashed line is the @xmath25-profile obtained after subtracting in quadrature the internal velocity dispersion of the subclusters from the observed vdp .",
    "the dash - dotted line is the @xmath25-profile obtained after correcting the observed number density profile and vdp of the subs class for the systematic selection effects , according to a plausible , but by no means unique , model . ]    since the assumption of ( nearly ) isotropic orbits is not valid for all except the early and , possibly , the s - early classes we have investigated what the data tell us about the orbital anisotropy . instead of trying constant anisotropy ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel et al . 2000 ; okas & mamon 2003 ) ) , or anisotropy models ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carlberg et al . 1997 ) ) , we determine @xmath23 directly from the data , using the procedure that @xcite developed from that of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 solutions are checked by inverting the jeans equation again ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel 1994 ) ) , thereby deriving a vdp that can be compared with the observed one .",
    "the derived vdp s always agree very well with the observed vdp s .",
    "we also applied this check to the sample of early - class galaxies , and indeed recovered @xmath21 to within @xmath26% .",
    "uncertainties on the @xmath25-profiles were estimated by dividing each galaxy sample into four subsamples , each containing a different half of all the galaxies in the original sample .",
    "we then applied the procedure of @xcite to each subsample .",
    "the rms of the four resulting @xmath25-profiles is an approximate , but probably conservative , estimate of the uncertainty in the full sample @xmath23 .",
    "physically acceptable solutions are found for the early and three of the four other populations of cluster galaxies .",
    "no acceptable solution is found for the bright class .",
    "this is most likely the consequence of a failure of the collisionless jeans equation in describing the dynamics of these galaxies , which is probably affected by dissipative processes , such as mergers and dynamical friction ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fusco - femiano & menci 1998 ) for a _ collisional _ solution ) .",
    "the @xmath25-profile obtained for the s - early class increases rapidly from @xmath27 near the centre , to @xmath28 at @xmath29 , and then smoothly decreases to @xmath30 again at larger radii ( see fig .  3 , top panel ) .",
    "taken at face value , this solution implies mild radial anisotropy just outside the cluster centre .",
    "the partial radial anisotropy at @xmath31 could result from a natural selection effect .",
    "i.e. , among s - early galaxies , those reaching the high - density inner cluster region can avoid transforming into s0 s only if they move sufficiently fast .",
    "we should not overinterpret the data , though , since the isotropic solution is acceptable for galaxies of the s - early class , and the @xmath25-profile is in fact consistent with @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath23 profile of the s - late galaxies is not different from unity out to @xmath32 , but then increases linearly with radius reaching a radial anisotropy @xmath28 at @xmath33 ( see fig .  3 , mid panel ) .",
    "this @xmath25-profile is remarkably similar to those obtained for dark matter particles in numerical simulations ( ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ghigna et al . 1998 ; diaferio 1999 ) ) .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude , by analogy , that s - late galaxies , like dark matter particles in numerical simulations , still retain memory of the process of ( mostly radial ) gravitational infall along the filaments connecting to the cluster , and are therefore recent arrivals into the cluster .",
    "finally , the data for the galaxies of the subs class imply orbits with substantial tangential anisotropy at all radii ( see fig .  3 , solid line in the bottom panel ) .",
    "however , two systematic effect must be accounted for .",
    "the first one is the internal velocity dispersion of subclusters .",
    "if we subtract an assumed internal velocity dispersion of 250  km  s@xmath11 from the observed vdp of subs galaxies , the orbital tangential anisotropy becomes even stronger ( see fig .  3 , dashed line in the bottom panel ) .",
    "the second effect is the radial variation of the efficiency of the detection of subs galaxies .",
    "very simple modeling shows that the efficiency of the selection method decreases towards the cluster center . as a result , both the number density profile and the vdp of the subs class are affected .",
    "a simple first - order correction of these profiles leads to a @xmath25-profile which no longer implies tangential orbits ( see fig .  3 ,",
    "dash - dotted line in the bottom panel ) . a better understanding of the orbital characteristics of subclusters thus requires either an improved , radially - unbiased , selection method of galaxies in subclusters , or at least an improved modeling of the biases .",
    "the early - class galaxies ( ellipticals and s0 galaxies ) in clusters have a distribution of line - of - sight velocities that is consistent with an isotropic orbit distribution .",
    "these galaxies were therefore used to derive the mass profile of the enacs ensemble cluster . using this mass profile , we constrained the orbits of cluster galaxies of other classes . from the distribution and velocity dispersion profile of the s - early - class",
    "we conclude that these may also have isotropic orbits , although they show an apparent radial anisotropy around @xmath34 .",
    "the latter may be a result of the process by which the majority of the s - early - galaxies are thought to have transformed into s0 galaxies through impulsive encounters .",
    "the fact that the local density around s - early - galaxies is smaller than that around s0 galaxies provides further support for this interpretation .",
    "the s - late - class has mildly radial orbits outside @xmath35 , and are probably still falling in .",
    "their absence from the central region most likely indicates that they are tidally disrupted on their crossing of the cluster core .",
    "finally , the galaxies in substructures apparently are on tangential orbits , although isotropic ( or mildly radial ) orbits can not be excluded at present ."
