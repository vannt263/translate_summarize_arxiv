    "massive stars ( @xmath4 ) burn their thermonuclear fuel all the way up to iron - group nuclei at the top of the nuclear binding energy curve .",
    "the resulting iron core is inert and supported primarily by the pressure of relativistic degenerate electrons .",
    "once the core exceeds its effective chandrasekhar mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) , collapse commences .",
    "as the core is collapsing , the density quickly rises , electron degeneracy increases , and electrons are captured onto protons and nuclei , causing the electron fraction to decrease . within a few tenths of a second after the onset of collapse ,",
    "the density of the homologous inner core surpasses nuclear densities .",
    "the collapse is abruptly stopped as the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) is rapidly stiffened by the strong nuclear force , causing the inner core to bounce back and send a shock wave through the supersonically infalling outer core .",
    "the prompt shock is not strong enough to blow through the entire star ; it rapidly loses energy dissociating accreting iron - group nuclei and to neutrino cooling . the shock stalls . determining what revives the shock and sends it through the rest of",
    "the star has been the bane of core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) theory for half a century . in the _ neutrino mechanism _",
    "@xcite , a small fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the outgoing neutrino luminosity from the protoneutron star ( pns ) is deposited behind the stalled shock .",
    "this drives turbulence and increases thermal pressure .",
    "the combined effects of these may revive the shock @xcite and the neutrino mechanism can potentially explain the vast majority of ccsne ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the _ magnetorotational mechanism _",
    "@xcite , rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields conspire to generate bipolar jet - like outflows that explode the star and could drive very energetic ccsn explosions",
    ". such magnetorotational explosions could be essential to explaining a class of massive star explosions that are about ten times more energetic than regular ccsne and that have been associated with long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "these _ hypernovae _ make up @xmath6@xmath7 of all ccsne @xcite .",
    "a key issue for the magnetorotational mechanism is its need for rapid core spin that results in a pns with a spin - period of around a millisecond .",
    "little is known observationally about core rotation in evolved massive stars , even with recent advances in asteroseismology  @xcite . on theoretical grounds and on the basis of pulsar birth spin estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "most massive stars are believed to have slowly spinning cores . yet , certain astrophysical conditions and processes , e.g. , chemically homogeneous evolution at low metallicity or binary interactions , might still provide the necessary core rotation in a fraction of massive stars sufficient to explain extreme hypernovae and long grbs  @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the detailed ccsn explosion mechanism , it is the repulsive nature of the nuclear force at short distances that causes core bounce in the first place and that ensures that neutron stars can be left behind in ccsne .",
    "the nuclear force underlying the nuclear eos is an effective quantum many body interaction and a piece of poorly understood fundamental physics . while essential for much of astrophysics involving compact objects , we have only incomplete knowledge of the nuclear eos .",
    "uncertainties are particularly large at densities above a few times nuclear and in the transition regime between uniform and nonuniform nuclear matter at around nuclear saturation density @xcite .",
    "the nuclear eos can be constrained by experiment ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , through fundamental theoretical considerations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or via astronomical observations of neutron star masses and radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational wave ( gw ) observations @xcite with advanced - generation detectors such as advanced ligo  @xcite , kagra  @xcite , and advanced virgo  @xcite open up another observational window for constraining the nuclear eos . in the inspiral phase of neutron star mergers ( including double neutron stars and neutron star ",
    "black hole binaries ) , tidal forces distort the neutron star shape .",
    "these distortions depend on the nuclear eos .",
    "they measurably affect the late inspiral gw signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at merger , tidal disruption of a neutron star by a black hole",
    "leads to a sudden cut off of the gw signal , which can be used to constrain eos properties @xcite . in the double neutron star case ,",
    "a hypermassive metastable or permanently stable neutron star remnant may be formed .",
    "it is triaxial and extremely efficiently emits gws with characteristics ( amplitudes , frequencies , time - frequency evolution ) that can be linked to the nuclear eos ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "ccsne may also provide gw signals that could constrain the nuclear eos @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we address the question of how the nuclear eos affects gws emitted at core bounce and in the very early post - core - bounce phase ( @xmath8 ) of rotating core collapse .",
    "stellar core collapse and the subsequent ccsn evolution are extremely rich in multi - dimensional dynamics that emit gws with a variety of characteristics ( see @xcite for reviews ) . rotating core collapse , bounce , and early postbounce evolution are particularly appealing for studying eos effects because they are essentially axisymmetric ( 2d ) @xcite and result in deterministic gw emission that depends on the nuclear eos , neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics , and gravity alone .",
    "complicating processes , such as prompt convection and neutrino - driven convection set in only later and are damped by rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while rapid rotation will amplify magnetic field , amplification to dynamically relevant field strengths is expected only tens of milliseconds after bounce  @xcite .",
    "hence , magnetohydrodynamic effects are unlikely to have a significant impact on the early rotating core collapse gw signal @xcite .",
    "gws from axisymmetric rotating core collapse , bounce , and the first ten or so milliseconds of the postbounce phase can , in principle , be templated to be used in matched - filtering approaches to gw detection and parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "that is , without stochastic ( e.g. , turbulent ) processes , the gw signal is deterministic and predictable for a given progenitor , eos , and set of electron capture rates .",
    "furthermore , gws from rotating core collapse are expected to be detectable by advanced - ligo class observatories throughout the milky way and out to the magellanic clouds @xcite .    rotating core collapse is the most",
    "extensively studied gw emission process in ccsne .",
    "detailed gw predictions on the basis of ( then 2d ) numerical simulations go back to mller ( 1982 ) @xcite .",
    "early work showed a wide variety of types of signals @xcite .",
    "however , more recent 2d/3d general - relativistic ( gr ) simulations that included nuclear - physics based eos and electron capture during collapse demonstrated that all gw signals from rapidly rotating core collapse exhibit a single core bounce followed by pns oscillations over a wide range of rotation profiles and progenitor stars  @xcite .",
    "ott  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that given the same specific angular momentum per enclosed mass , cores of different progenitor stars proceed to give essentially the same rotating core collapse gw signal .",
    "abdikamalov  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite went a step further and demonstrated that the gw signal is determined primarily by the mass and ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational energy ( @xmath0 ) of the inner core at bounce .",
    "the eos dependence of the rotating core collapse gw signal has thus far received little attention .",
    "dimmelmeier  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out 2d gr hydrodynamic rotating core collapse simulations using two different eos ( ls180  @xcite and hshen  @xcite ) , four different progenitors ( @xmath9 ) , and 16 different rotation profiles .",
    "they found that the rotating core collapse gw signal changes little between the ls180 and the hshen eos , but that there may be a slight ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) trend of the gw spectrum toward higher frequencies for the softer ls180 eos .",
    "abdikamalov  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out simulations with the ls220  @xcite and the hshen  @xcite eos .",
    "however , they compared only the effects of differential rotation between eos and did not carry out an overall analysis of eos effects .    in this study , we build upon and substantially extend previous work on rotating core collapse .",
    "we perform 2d gr hydrodynamic simulations using one @xmath12-@xmath13 progenitor star model , 18 different nuclear eos , and 98 different initial rotational setups .",
    "we carry out a total of 1824 simulations and analyze in detail the influence of the nuclear eos on the rotating core collapse gw signal .",
    "the resulting waveform catalog is an order of magnitude larger than previous gw catalogs for rotating core collapse and is publicly available at at https://stellarcollapse.org/richers_2017_rrccsn_eos .",
    "the results of our study show that the nuclear eos affects rotating core collapse gw emission through its effect on the mass of inner core at bounce and the central density of the postbounce pns .",
    "we furthermore find that the gw emission is sensitive to the treatment of the transition of nonuniform to uniform nuclear matter , to the treatment of nuclei at subnuclear densities , and to the eos parameterization at around nuclear saturation density .",
    "the interplay of all of these elements make it challenging for advanced - ligo - class observatories to discern between theoretical models of nuclear matter in these regimes .",
    "since rotating core collapse does not probe densities in excess of around twice nuclear , very little exotic physics ( e.g. , hyperons , deconfined quarks ) can be probed by its gw emission .",
    "we also test the sensitivity of our results to variations in electron capture during collapse .",
    "since the inner core mass at bounce is highly sensitive to the details of electron capture and deleptonization during collapse , our results suggest that full gr neutrino radiation - hydrodynamic simulations with a detailed treatment of nuclear electron capture ( e.g. , @xcite ) will be essential for generating truly reliable gw templates for rotating core collapse .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : eos ] , we introduce the 18 different nuclear eos used in our simulations .",
    "we then present our simulation methods in section  [ sec : methods ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the results of our 2d core collapse simulations , investigating the effects of the eos and electron capture rates on the rotating core collapse gw signal .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : yeofrho ] , we provide fits to electron fraction profiles obtained from 1d gr radiation - hydrodynamic simulations and , in appendix  [ app : numerics ] , we describe results from supplemental simulations that test various approximations .        in table  [",
    "tab : coconut_tests ] , we list the inner core mass at bounce , the gw mismatch ( see section  [ sec : snr ] ) with the fiducial 2d simulation , the peak frequency , and the bounce signal amplitude for several 2d tests",
    ". the results of the fiducial 2d simulation are bolded at the top for comparison .",
    "the nulib and gr1d blocks of table  [ tab : coconut_tests ] use the @xmath14 profile generated by the corresponding 1d test simulation in a 2d simulation otherwise identical to the fiducial one . these all produce negligible differences in all quantities .",
    "rotation is multidimensional , so the `` shellular rotation '' approximation in ` gr1d ` does not take into account multidimensional effects .",
    "the lack of impact of approximate 1.5d rotation on the collapse deleptonization suggests that using a @xmath14 profile from a nonrotating 1d simulation in moderately - rapidly rotating 2d collapse simulation is acceptable .",
    "the choice of @xmath14 parameterization , however , leads to significant differences , as already pointed out in the previous appendix  [ app : gr1dtests ] .",
    "the gw mismatch for the `` fit '' and `` center '' choices with the fiducial approach is @xmath101% and @xmath105% , respectively .",
    "the peak frequencies differ by @xmath102% .",
    "using the g15 @xmath14 fit of @xcite leads to even larger mismatch of @xmath10@xmath15 and a peak frequency differing by as much as @xmath10@xmath16 .",
    "these differences are as large or larger than differences between many eos discussed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we do not expect this to affect the universal trends we establish in the main text , since differences in eos already produce different @xmath14 profiles yielding simulation results that consistently follow the universal trends .",
    "however , it reaffirms that for quantitatively reliable gw signal predictions , a detailed and converged treatment of prebounce deleptonization with radiation hydrodynamics is vital .    in the final block of table  [",
    "tab : coconut_tests ] , we summarize results of simulations in which we increase the resolution and order of the time integrator in ` coconut ` simulations .",
    "these lead to waveform mismatches of up to 0.4% , significantly smaller than those from systematic errors induced by the prebounce deleptonization treatment .",
    "as pointed out in section  [ sec : coconut ] , we transition from the @xmath14 deleptonization prescription to neutrino leakage when the entropy along the polar axis exceeds @xmath17 . in rotating models , this is a fraction of a millisecond before this occurs on the equatorial axis , which is our definition of the time of core bounce .",
    "the row labeled `` ` coconut ` eq .",
    "bounce '' shows that having the trigger on the equatorial axis results in negligible differences .",
    "to summarize , our 1d and 2d simulation results are essentially independent of the neutrino interaction table resolution and of the 1d grid resolution .",
    "there is a weak dependence on the 2d grid resolution ( below 1% mismatch in all resolution tests ) .",
    "however , the results are sensitive to the treatment of prebounce deleptonization at the level of several percent gw mismatch . again ,",
    "future gr radiation hydrodynamic simulations with detailed nuclear electron capture rates will be needed for reliable predictions of gravitational waveforms from rotating core collapse ."
