    "collisionless shocks in space environments are generally considered to be sites of efficient particle acceleration .",
    "one of the main unsolved problems is how efficiently individual particles can be fed into a fermi - type acceleration process .",
    "there , the particles have a mean free path , @xmath0 , large enough that they see the shock as a sharp discontinuity and assume a power - law spectrum @xcite . by definition ,",
    "collisionless shocks have a thickness of a few @xmath0  of the thermal ions .",
    "in particular for electrons , pre - acceleration appears to be required for injection into fermi - type shock acceleration .",
    "the shock transition region harbors small - scale electric and magnetic turbulence that dissipate the flow energy and may provide pre - acceleration @xcite .",
    "studies of nonrelativistic shocks indicate that the structure and dissipation mechanisms at these shocks vary considerably depending on the upstream plasma parameters and the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal , @xmath1 .",
    "quasi - perpendicular shocks , @xmath2 , have been studied for many years , and the basic structure of such shocks with alfvn mach number @xmath3 is well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . however , the physics of quasi - perpendicular shocks in the limit of high alfvn mach number , as applicable to supernova remnants ( snrs ) , is still under debate , in particular the electron injection problem @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quasi - parallel shocks , @xmath4 , have been harder to understand .",
    "observations of magnetic - field - aligned ion beams and large - amplitude low - frequency magnetic fluctuations upstream of space - plasma shocks have incited interest in electromagnetic ion - beam instabilities @xcite as sources of the necessary dissipation at the shock , particle injection , and subsequent scattering into a fermi - type acceleration mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the shock transition revealed that the shock ramp , where the principal density jump occurs , is not steady , but instead cyclicly re - forms such that the shock on average maintains its correct speed @xcite .",
    "these effects have often been studied with one - dimensional hybrid simulations @xcite that did not resolve electron and short - scale ion spatio - temporal scales .",
    "short particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of mildly relativistic quasiparallel shocks were performed by and @xcite . in quasiparallel conditions , whistler and alfvn waves",
    "are excited that in their nonlinear evolution grow into short large - amplitude magnetic - field structures ( slams ) , which are supposed to be efficient electron accelerators .",
    "@xcite recently reported the formation of nonrelativistic shocks in unmagnetized electron - ion plasmas via a weibel - type short - wave instability @xcite for relative flow speeds between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the speed of light ) .",
    "the relativistic two - stream weibel ( filamentation ) instability @xcite is known to mediate relativistic - shock formation in collisionless unmagnetized or weakly - magnetized electron - positron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and electron - ion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plasmas .",
    "it leads to the development of current filaments and accompanying toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the results by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) demonstrate that a pre - existing magnetic field is not necessary for the existence of shock - mediating instabilities in non - relativistic flows .",
    "they also show that electron dynamics is relevant for shock formation in unmagnetized plasma , which calls for a fully kinetic ( pic ) modeling in addition to hybrid simulations that can cover a longer time period and have been successfully employed for oblique nonrelativistic shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have embarked on very - large - scale kinetic plasma simulations of the formation of unmagnetized or weakly - magnetized strictly parallel ( @xmath8 ) nonrelativistic shocks , their long - term evolution , and particle acceleration . to address the question whether or not the shock structure and the particle spectra",
    "ever reach a steady state , we follow the evolution of the system longer than was done in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in asymmetric flows , i.e. , the collision of plasma slabs of different density , leading to two different shocks and a contact discontinuity ( cd ) . the mach number is set high enough that electrostatic shocks will not be formed .",
    "we want to see whether a parallel magnetic field renders shock formation more efficient .",
    "in the simulations with magnetized plasma , the magnetic - field strength is assumed sufficiently low for the formation of the forward and reverse shocks with large alfvnic mach number , @xmath9 .",
    "this , together with the assumption of sub - relativistic plasma collision speed , renders our simulations applicable to the conditions at young snrs .",
    "in contrast to a conducting - wall reflection method to set up the shock , used in @xcite , our asymmetric slab - collision model is physically more accurate as it avoids assuming the existence of an infinitely sharp cd ( in fact a grid - cell wide ) and allows us to properly investigate the dynamics of the forward and reverse shocks for different stream - counterstream parameters and magnetic field configurations .",
    "beam - plasma systems are susceptible to various instabilities : some electrostatic ( e.g. , two - stream or buneman modes ) , other quasi - electrostatic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and still others electromagnetic ( e.g. , filamentation ) .",
    "the unstable spectrum is thus at least two - dimensional . which of these modes would grow fastest highly depends on the system parameters @xcite .",
    "this clearly demonstrates a need for studies using setup like ours , since the most unstable modes excited in various settings may result in completely different shock - generating plasma waves .",
    "besides demonstrating the efficiency of the shock - formation processes in the presence of the mean magnetic field , a secondary advantage of restricting to a parallel or absent large - scale magnetic field is that simulations can be set up cleaner .",
    "pic simulations are sensitive to electromagnetic transients that arise from the initial setup and propagate through the simulation box . in shock simulations they can induce scattering turbulence and electron heating in the upstream region of the shock .",
    "likewise , a perpendicular component of the homogeneous magnetic field implies that in the collision region ( or reflecting plane , if that is used to set up the shock ) the curl of either the magnetic field or the motional electric field is large , effectively acting as an antenna and emitting an electromagnetic pulse .",
    "the simulation model and setup are described in section [ setup ] .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in section [ concl ] .",
    "in our simulations , two electron - ion plasma streams of different densities collide with each other at relative speed @xmath10 .",
    "the density ratio between the _ dense _ and the _ tenuous _ plasma slab is @xmath11 .",
    "the simulation frame of reference is the center - of - momentum frame of the two plasmas , in which the dense ( left ) plasma stream moves to the right in @xmath12-direction with velocity @xmath13 and the tenuous ( right ) stream moves to the left in @xmath14-direction at @xmath15 . for simplicity",
    ", we will refer to the electrons and ions of the dense plasma stream as _ dense electrons _ and _ dense ions _ , and as _ tenuous electrons _ and _ tenuous ions _ for the dilute plasma .",
    "the plasmas are initially very cold ; in the respective rest frames of the streams , the electrons have a thermal distribution with @xmath16 and are in thermal equilibrium with the ions .",
    "we consider both unmagnetized and magnetized plasma conditions . in the latter case ,",
    "the plasma flow is aligned with the homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath17 , and thus we restrict our study to the formation of parallel shocks .",
    "the mean magnetic - field strength is given by the ratio of the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath18 to the electron plasma frequency of the dense - plasma component , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath21 is the density of dense electrons ) , which is @xmath22 .",
    "such a flow - aligned magnetic - field allows filamentation - like instabilities .",
    "as shown in , e.g. , @xcite , for the parameters of the initial plasma slab collision considered here and taking into account counterstreaming electron beams only , a plasma magnetization larger than @xmath23 would be required to suppress purely transverse filamentation modes , whereas a complete stabilization of oblique modes would never be efficient . with the assumed plasma magnetization of one - third of the suppression field , the filamentation instability growth rate is reduced by 10% only .",
    "the simulation setup is thus designed to be applicable to young snrs , in which dense supernova ejecta propagating with nonrelativistic velocity collide with a dilute weakly - magnetized interstellar medium .    on account of the slower rate of shock - forming instabilities in nonrelativistic flows , our large - scale simulations of nonrelativistic plasma collisions",
    "have been performed in two spatial dimensions but keeping three components of the particle velocities ( a 2d3v model ) .",
    "the code used in this study is a 2d3v modified version of the relativistic electromagnetic particle code tristan with mpi - based parallelization @xcite .",
    "we have performed extensive test simulations to formulate a numerical model that best conserves energy and minimizes numerical self - heating to provide a cold plasma beam that is sufficiently stable against numerical grid - cherenkov and other instabilities .",
    "the model takes advantage of second - order particle shapes and uses a second - order fdtd field - solver with a weak friedman filter @xcite to suppress small - scale noise . in comparison with the numerical model used in previous work ( e.g. , *",

    "we base our discussion on the results obtained for a reduced ion - electron mass ratio @xmath27 ( runs u1 and m1 in table 1 ) .",
    "a slight dependence of the simulation results on the assumed mass ratio has been observed in @xcite . to ascertain the effects of this parameter on the long - time evolution of the system we performed large - scale simulations also for @xmath28 ( runs u2 and m2 ) ;",
    "the results of these simulations are summarized in appendix a. for runs u1 and m1 , referred here as to the _ unmagnetized _ and _ magnetized _ simulation , respectively , the ion skin depth of the dense plasma is @xmath29 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath30 will be used as the unit of length and we take the inverted ion plasma frequency of the dense component , @xmath31 , as our unit of time . the time step we use is @xmath32 .",
    "the simulations have been performed on a spatial grid in the @xmath33 plane with radiating boundary conditions in @xmath34 and periodic boundary conditions in @xmath35 .",
    "the transverse size of the computational grid used in runs u1 and m1 is @xmath36 and the system evolution has been followed for @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 , which in simulation m1 corresponds to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the ion cyclotron frequency .",
    "the simulations thus require a very large grid size in plasma flow direction , because the interpenetrating plasma streams occupy a continuously increasing volume .",
    "our mpi - parallelized model partitions the simulation box into processor - domains of equal size , and the number of processor - domains in the transverse direction is constant . to limit the computational expense , in terms of both processor - usage and memory ,",
    "an actual simulation is broken into several segments of different size in @xmath34 , for which the number of processor - domains in flow direction is increased .",
    "thus , to complete an simulation with , e.g. , @xmath41 time steps , succeeding runs with 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 216-processor domains each with @xmath42 cells are performed on 216 , 432 , 864 , and 1296 cores , respectively . particles are continuously added to the system on both sides of the collision region with a so - called moving - injector . in this method , the injection layer moves away from the interaction region at a distance that preserves all the particles and fields generated in the collision region , but at the same time does not allow a beam to travel a long distance without interaction with counterstreaming particles , which further helps avoiding numerical grid - cherenkov effects .    note that the parameters used in the main numerical experiments were chosen following an extended scan of the parameter space ( e.g. , number of particle per cell , the electron skin depth , the magnetic field strength ) performed with smaller - size simulations .",
    "the results of the two selected production runs , u1 and m1 , are thus representative of the physical effects observed in the unmagnetized and weakly - magnetized system .",
    "the validity of the two - dimensional simulations in capturing the essential physics of parallel shock formation through the electromagnetic instabilities has been demonstrated in numerous studies of relativistic and nonrelativistic shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the collision of the two plasma streams , as studied in this work , should in the nonlinear stage result in the formation of a system of forward and reverse shocks separated by a cd .",

    "the oblique mode is thus excited with wavelength @xmath73 , comparable to the skindepth of the tenuous - ion component",
    ". however , the dense - ion beam shows a very strong density gradient in the tenuous - plasma region .",
    "the conditions that determine the spectrum of unstable modes thus vary with distance from the cd from ones suitable for the oblique mode further upstream ( at @xmath74 ) to those in the region closer to the cd ( at @xmath75 ) that allow quasi - perpendicular filamentation - like modes ( @xmath76 ) to grow fastest . in effect , the magnetic structure formed at the dilute head of the dense - ion beam becomes strongly modified by a filamentation - like instability which grows faster than the oblique instability and therefore leads to more efficient magnetic - field amplification .",
    "as seen in figure [ unm1 ] , the instabilities spatially separate the ions of both slabs .",
    "narrow filaments in cold tenuous ions are surrounded by electrons .",
    "the volume between the filaments is depleted of tenuous ions and occupied by the ions of the dense beam .",

    "whereas the filamentation instability operating in the tenuous plasma can generate strong magnetic turbulence in this region , the oblique instability leads to only moderate magnetic - field amplification in the dense plasma left of the cd .",

    "the compression of electrons is provided solely by the tenuous - electron component whereas the ion compression is initially dominated by the dense ions ( see fig .",

    "such nonlinear structures are known to frequently occur in plasma physics and astrophysics applications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "note , that although the interaction between the dense - ion beam and the charge - density waves turns highly nonlinear , it is the filamentation instability that remains the dominant source of magnetic - field generation . as is evident in figure [ unm2]b , the average magnetic - energy density in the region of nonlinear filamentation ( @xmath88 ) is about an order of magnitude larger that the energy density associated with plasma compressions further upstream . nevertheless , the role of density modulations is not negligible .",

    "although the downstream tenuous - ion density distribution is strongly turbulent , it is evident from figure [ unm3]f that the dilute - ion beam is not decoupled from the dense plasma and , despite being hot , continues to carry a substantial bulk - flow energy across the cd .",
    "consequently , the forward - shock compression ratio carries a substantial contribution from the dense ions .",
    "note in figure [ unm3]a , that the density of dense ions roughly equal to the tenuous - ion density is required to match the electron compression , that is provided solely by tenuous electrons .",
    "as shown in figure [ unm4 ] , that displays particle distributions in the forward shock downstream , the tenuous - ion spectrum strongly deviates from a thermal distribution .",
    "the electrons of the tenuous plasma , accelerated at the expense of the ion bulk - kinetic energy , are thermalized .",
    "since they are forced to follow the ion spatial distribution to maintain charge neutrality , their density is neither uniform nor steady in the downstream region .",
    "we conclude that the forward shock has not yet fully developed .",
    "although in asymmetric unmagnetized - plasma collisions kinetic instabilities generate ample magnetic turbulence in the tenuous - plasma region , the magnetic field is still too weak to efficiently decouple the dilute - ion beam from the dense slab and to force the ion - beam reflection needed to maintain the shock .",
    "the contribution of the reflected tenuous ions to the total density of ions counterstreaming against the incoming tenuous beam and to the plasma compression at the cd continuously increases during the simulation .",
    "however , downstream of the forward shock the density of tenuous ions begins to exceed that of dense ions only at a very late stage .",
    "reflection of the tenuous ions is most effective downstream and in the foreshock region with strong current filaments ( see region with @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ unm3 ] ) , but takes place also in the ion precursor further upstream where plasma cavities nonlinearly grow and expand ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this can also be observed in figure [ unm2]g .",
    "one can note that the locations at which the ions are decelerated and deflected well coincide with the density compressions caused by the expanding cavities ( compare , e.g. , @xmath94 and @xmath95 in figs .",
    "[ unm2]d - e and [ unm2]g ) . as the electron phase - space plots reveal ( figs .",
    "[ unm2]f and [ unm3]d ) , the ion deceleration at these locations is accompanied by localized electron heating .",
    "as noted above , in the simulation frame the system of forward and reverse shocks separated by a cd moves toward the incoming dense - plasma beam with velocity @xmath91 .",
    "this speed defines the _ cd frame _ or _ downstream rest frame _ , in which particle spectra are calculated .",
    "particle spectra in kinetic energy , @xmath96 , are presented in figure  [ unm4 ] .",
    "they are based on all particles located downstream of the forward shock in a slice of width @xmath97 , centered at @xmath71 . at this location ,",
    "the contribution of dense electrons ( not shown ) to the total number density and kinetic energy density is negligible .",
    "the distribution of tenuous electrons is isotropic and quasi - thermal with no evidence of a supra - thermal tail .",
    "thus the efficiency of any electron - injection process that may have occurred in the forward - shock region in the unmagnetized plasma is very small ( compare sec . [ mdist ] ) .",
    "the electrons account for 37% of the total particle kinetic energy , dense ions contribute another 38% , and dilute ions carry the remaining 25% .",
    "the ion distributions are very anisotropic , which impacts the energy spectra ( compare figs . [ unm3]e-[unm3]f ) . in the spectrum of tenuous ions",
    ", the decelerated beam largely contributes to a peak around @xmath98 ; heated beam particles and particles returning upstream build the high - energy tail .",
    "the dense ions form a separate colder distribution that is not mixed in phase - space with the dilute component .",
    "the high - energy tail in the spectrum is formed by particles that are reflected back to the dense plasma region .",
    "these features again demonstrate that the forward shock is yet in the formation phase and the processes of energy exchange / equilibration between the electron and ion components are still ongoing .",
    "an important feature to be noted from figure [ unm3 ] is that the forward shock is a region in which the ions of the dense beam are strongly deflected and accelerated towards negative momenta , up to the initial momentum of the tenuous ions ( see fig .",
    "[ unm4 ] ) . in consequence , these particles are able to cross the cd back to the reverse - shock region to form there a population of hot and energetic ions counterstreaming against the incoming dense - plasma beam",
    ". this component of the dense ions can be clearly seen in the phase - space distribution displayed in figure [ unm3]e .",
    "the counterstreaming dense - ion beam is generated during the entire evolution of the system , slowly building the plasma compression associated with the reverse shock left of the cd .    by the time the simulation ends ,",
    "the reverse - shock transition has not yet reached the compression ratio of a hydrodynamic shock ( upper dashed line in fig .",
    "[ unm3]a ) .",
    "although the plasma density is homogeneous in the vicinity of the cd , particle distributions , including dense electrons , are strongly anisotropic .",
    "upstream of the density compression , the oblique - mode instability amplifies the transverse magnetic field resulting in structures analogous to those observed earlier .",
    "the instability is generated in the entire extended region that is populated with particles of the hot tenuous - ion beam .",
    "the magnetic field is very weak and exerts no visible modulation to the plasma density .",
    "this is largely due to temperature effects .",
    "the tenuous - ion beam is accompanied by a cloud of very hot tenuous electrons that provide charge neutrality and also cause substantial heating of the dense electrons .",
    "the oblique - filamentary magnetic structures advected and compressed in the reverse shock are further amplified through interactions with energetic dense - ion particles reflected in the cd region , so that a weak magnetic precursor to the reverse shock forms .",
    "the strength of the mean magnetic field assumed for the magnetized run m1 has been chosen to characterize the physical effects introduced to the system described in section [ sumag ] by the presence of the homogeneous flow - aligned field component .",
    "the physical conditions represent a weakly - magnetized plasma , in which strong shock waves should form .",
    "as checked with additional test runs , systems with lower magnetic - field strength show characteristics intermediate between those observed for run u1 and m1 .",
    "figure [ mag1 ] shows the structure of the collision region in magnetized plasma at early time , @xmath99 . as in the unmagnetized simulation ( compare fig .",
    "[ unm1 ] ) , the observed filamentation of plasma and the associated perpendicular magnetic turbulence result from weibel - like instabilities . a direct comparison of figures [ unm1 ] and [ mag1 ] reveals that several characteristics of the magnetized system are analogous to those described for the unmagnetized case . in particular , the magnetic - energy density in the tenuous - plasma region exceeds the turbulent - field energy reached in the dense plasma left of the cd .",
    "the similarities are also seen in the electromagnetic and density structure in the vicinity of the cd and in the tenuous - plasma region .    notably different from the unmagnetized case",
    "is the structure of the dense - plasma region , in which an almost purely perpendicular filamentation - like mode is produced at the head of the tenuous - ion beam counterstreaming against the incoming dense plasma .",
    "this mode appears in the out - of - plane magnetic field , @xmath84 , that is strongly amplified .",
    "the large - scale distributions of particle densities ( figs . [ mag1]d-[mag1]g ) show that the density modulations associated with this mode first appear in the tenuous ions that form narrow filaments with large density contrast ( @xmath100 ) . behind these structures , filamentary modulations",
    "develop in the densities of dense electrons and ions ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "these filaments merge and grow in size , but their density contrast decreases further downstream of the tenuous - ion flow ( @xmath102 ) , where magnetic - field filaments are further amplified through mergers .",
    "the nature of the filamentation - like mode can be verified with linear analysis . in figure",
    "[ mag1a ] , we show the growth rate in reduced - wavevector space @xmath103 , @xmath104 , for parameters that should represent the conditions at the head of the tenuous - ion beam .",
    "the calculations assume an initial density contrast of @xmath105 between the tenuous and the dense - ion beam and the corresponding initial injection velocities .",
    "the charge and current of the dilute ion beam are to 90% balanced by electrons of the dense beam reflected during the initial plasma collision ; the remaining portion is provided by tenuous electrons leaking across the cd ( see fig .",
    "[ mag1 ] ) .",
    "the reflected dense electrons are assumed to move with the bulk of the tenuous beam to account for the current balance .",
    "although the plasma beams are heated in the simulation , we perform our calculations in the zero - temperature approximation .",
    "however , in figure [ mag1a ] we present only the low-@xmath106 part of the spectrum , related to instabilities that involve the ions , and we do not show the two - stream electrostatic modes at high wavenumbers that grow strongly in a cold plasma but are suppressed at finite temperature .",
    "the perpendicular wavevector of the dominant unstable mode , @xmath107 , is in perfect agreement with @xmath108 measured in the simulation ( @xmath109 ) and so is a nearly purely transverse character of the mode  the predicted @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that the wavelength of the mode is not sensitive to temperature effects , although the growth rate appears to be reduced in warm plasma .",
    "we have further confirmed this with additional test simulations that assumed higher initial temperatures of the colliding beams ( see also sec .",
    "[ revm ] ) .",
    "our large - scale run m2 , with @xmath28 , together with another set of test runs , that incorporated larger ion - electron mass ratios of @xmath111 and 200 , reveal that a critical parameter determining the strength of this unstable mode is ion inertia .",
    "the effect of the magnetic turbulence in the collision region on the motion of tenuous ions that pass through it is stronger for lower - mass particles and results in a warm beam for run m2 ( see also appendix a ) . instead , for larger mass ratios the physical conditions in the test simulations approximate a cold - plasma limit of the linear analysis .",
    "the presence of the filamentation - like mode significantly influences the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the nonlinear development of the instability in the dense - plasma region is presented in figure [ mag2 ] as a sequence of snapshots that show the @xmath84 magnetic - field component and density distributions of dense and tenuous ions for @xmath112 , 655 , 874 , and 1093 .",
    "the distribution of dense electrons closely follows that of the dense ions .",
    "we also show in figure [ mag3 ] the average profiles of particle densities and electromagnetic - energy densities , together with the phase - space distributions across the whole collision region for @xmath1131093 and 1801 .",
    "the filamentary modulations in the dense plasma , that were formed behind the transverse tenuous - ion density filaments during the linear phase of the instability ( @xmath114 , fig .",
    "[ mag2]a ) turn in the later stage into dense - plasma cavities surrounded by regions of enhanced plasma density .",
    "these structures form only in the dense plasma and can be explained as resulting from the magnetic bubbles that are created through localized accumulation of magnetic energy caused by merging of strong current filaments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pressure gradient at the magnetic bubbles pushes the dense plasma out and causes the growth of the cavities . the subsequent radial expansion of the voids into each other results in further plasma compression and thus magnetic - field amplification .",
    "similar in appearance to the dense plasma voids , narrow filaments in the tenuous ions , that initially emerge at the front of the beam , later merge , grow in size , and eventually disperse to develop a nearly homogeneous density distribution .",
    "the growth of the filaments can be traced through the magnetic - field structures in figure [ mag2 ] .",
    "they demonstrate that the character of the unstable mode evolves into an oblique mode that provides only a moderate magnetic - field amplification , compared to the level acquired through the initial filamentation - like mode ( compare the average magnetic - field profiles in fig .",
    "[ mag1]b for @xmath115 and in fig .",
    "[ mag3]b for @xmath116 ) .",
    "the tenuous ions remain unaffected by the pressure gradient at the magnetic bubbles due to their rapid motion .",
    "the density modulations in this plasma component seen around the cavities are instead the result of the nonlinear development of streaming instabilities that in this region become further enhanced by the approaching denser stream of tenuous electrons and dense ions reflected in the vicinity of the cd .",
    "this dense - ion component can be clearly seen in figure [ mag3]d for @xmath117 .",
    "the formation of voids in the dense plasma greatly affects the subsequent evolution of the system .",
    "the cavities observed for @xmath118 at @xmath119 ( fig . [ mag2]d ) can be seen as modulations in the average density of the dense plasma , that are associated with a broad peak in the magnetic - energy density ( fig .",
    "[ mag3]a - b ) that is comparable to the magnetic - turbulence level generated in the tenuous - plasma region to the right of the cd .",
    "this strong field perturbs particle trajectories , thus enforcing the reflection of the interpenetrating beams into their respective upstream regions .",
    "one can observe this effect in figures [ mag3]d - e .",
    "localized particle reflection in the region of the cavities is independent of beam deceleration and reflection processes operating in the vicinity of the cd ( @xmath120 ) . due to the large strength of the magnetic field , which is continuously amplified by the compression between the expanding voids ,",
    "particle reflection is very efficient .",
    "one observes in the right panel of figure [ mag3 ] that by the time @xmath121 returning ions of both the dense and the tenuous plasma form almost homogeneous populations in the extended region around the cd .",
    "the region of cavities thus constitutes a barrier for the incoming beams that causes the accumulation of particles of each plasma component on their side of this barrier .",
    "the average - density profiles ( fig .",
    "[ mag3]f ) and phase - space distributions ( fig .",
    "[ mag3]h - j ) clearly illustrate this behaviour .",
    "note in particular the greatly increased contribution of the tenuous ions to the total density of ions that counterstream against the incoming tenuous beam right from the cd . also , the dense - plasma region has become largely depleted of electrons of the tenuous component , that in addition have experienced strong heating in the region of cavities .",
    "the filamentation - like instability in the dense - plasma region thus provides a mechanism to efficiently decouple the colliding ion beams .",
    "compared to the case of unmagnetized plasma , the presence of the mean magnetic field enables an efficient formation of the forward and reverse shocks , whose subsequent evolution is largely independent of the initial conditions .      the structure of the collision region at the end of the simulation at time @xmath122 is presented in figure [ mag4 ] ( to be compared with fig .  [ unm3 ] ) .",
    "one can clearly see a system of forward and reverse shocks separated by a cd .",
    "the shocks are visible as enhancement in the number density at @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the forward and reverse shock , respectively .",
    "the compression ratio at each shock reaches @xmath125 , in agreement with the hydrodynamical jump conditions for nonrelativistic gas with @xmath45 , that predict @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the simulation frame for the forward and reverse shock , respectively ( upper and lower dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ mag4]a ) .",
    "the shock velocities measured in run m1 are also consistent with theoretical steady - state values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the simulation frame",
    ". the cd moves with a speed close to the predicted @xmath91 and at the end of the run is located at @xmath126 .",
    "note , that the location of the cd is shifted to the left compared to that in the unmagnetized run . only in the magnetized case ,",
    "the shock - formation processes allow for an efficient heating of the tenuous plasma , whose pressure is sufficiently high to drive bulk - plasma motion already at an early stage .",
    "as one can see in figure [ mag4]a , the ion compression at the forward shock is almost entirely provided by the tenuous plasma ( cf .",
    "unmagnetized simulation u1 ) .",
    "although , as evidenced by the ion phase - space distributions in figures [ mag4]e and [ mag4]f , the contribution of the dense ions to the number density of particles returning upstream is comparable to that of the tenuous ions , the latter represent a more directed and faster flow deep in the forward - shock precursor and also completely dominate the precursor dynamics further upstream ( beyond @xmath127 ) .",
    "thus , late in the simulation the forward shock begins to resemble a self - propagating structure that is exclusively maintained by shock - reflected particles , independent of the processes operating at and behind the cd .",
    "this is not yet the case in the dense - plasma region .",
    "although the dynamics of the deep reverse - shock precursor ( @xmath128 ) is solely governed by the shock - reflected dense ions , the physics farther upstream is still determined by the interaction of counterstreaming beams of dense and tenuous ions ( see below ) .",
    "note , however , that the tenuous - ion beam in the reverse - shock precursor , that has diluted , slowed - down , and heated , is at this stage decoupled from the main tenuous - plasma beam coming in from the right of the cd ( fig .",
    "[ mag4]f ) .    the turbulent electromagnetic field in the collision region is strongly amplified throughout the simulation to eventually reach a level about an order of magnitude larger than that achieved in unmagnetized conditions .",

    "the energy density of the magnetic field in the forward - shock region peaks at the shock front and then decays downstream @xcite .",
    "this turbulence is mostly generated when the forward shock is self - propagating .",
    "the second maximum to the immediate right of the cd arises from the amplified magnetic turbulence produced via filamentation instabilities during the early evolution of the system , before the ion beams have become decoupled from each other .",
    "the broad peak in the magnetic field energy density to the left of the cd has largely evolved from the magnetic turbulence generated earlier in the region of cavities ( fig .",
    "[ mag3 ] ) .",
    "it also constitutes the shock - compressed magnetic turbulence produced upstream of the reverse shock after the cavities in the dense plasma have dissipated to form the downstream region of the reverse shock .",
    "figure [ mag5 ] presents the structure of the forward - shock transition at time @xmath129 .",
    "this time was chosen to display the magnetic - field amplitude @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ mag5]a ) and the density of tenuous ions ( fig .",
    "[ mag5]b ) with correct aspect ratio ; the characteristics discussed are the same as those observed at @xmath122 ( fig . [ mag4 ] ) . the tenuous - electron distribution ( not shown )",
    "closely follows that of tenuous ions ; they also provide charge balance to the low - density dense ions that occupy the volume between tenuous - ion filaments .",
    "as seen in figure [ mag5 ] , the main source of turbulent magnetic field is the electromagnetic weibel - type instability .",
    "strong nonlinear effects of the interaction of returning particle beams with electrostatically - induced parallel density structures , reported in the forward - shock precursor for the unmagnetized case , are not observed .",
    "the two - stream instability between incoming and returning electron beams generates electrostatic perturbations far upstream that lead to nonlinear charge - density waves in the precursor ( for @xmath130 in fig .",
    "[ mag5]b ) , but the interaction of the density modulations with the reflected ions does not result in the formation of plasma cavities .",
    "the growth and expansion of parallel density fluctuations is suppressed by the mean magnetic field .",
    "the tenuous - plasma filaments , that pinch and merge in the forward - shock foot , break up at the shock interface and dissipate to form a nearly homogeneous density distribution downstream of the shock ( @xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ mag5]b ) .",
    "the disintegration of the tenuous - ion beam downstream of the forward shock was not observed in the unmagnetized simulation u1 .",
    "nevertheless , although the downstream tenuous - ion density is close to uniform , they are not fully thermalized ( see below ) , which indicates that the forward - shock evolution has not fully reached a steady state by the end of the simulation .",
    "as discussed in section [ emag ] , strong fluctuations in the density of the dense plasma and the magnetic field resulting from a filamentation - like instability in the region of cavities began to form an obstacle for the incoming tenuous plasma and eventually caused a depletion of these particles in the dense - beam region upstream of the dense - plasma voids .",
    "in addition , the tenuous ions at the head of the dilute - ion beam were heated and the filaments dispersed . in effect , the character of the unstable magnetic mode has changed from almost purely perpendicular to slowly - growing oblique turbulence , with characteristics similar to those described for the reverse - shock precursor in the unmagnetized run u1 ( sec . [ urev ] ) . as in the unmagnetized case , the oblique magnetic mode is generated wherever the tenuous - ion beam propagates in the upstream region of the reverse shock .",
    "however , the presence of the mean magnetic field triggers an additional plasma mode in the system that slowly grows and eventually dominates the magnetic - turbulence spectrum in the reverse - shock precursor .",
    "figure [ mag6 ] presents the reverse - shock transition at time @xmath132 , at which the initial oblique mode has already attenuated .",
    "as seen in figures [ mag6]b and [ mag6]c , that show the @xmath133 and @xmath84 magnetic - field components , respectively , the unstable mode represents an almost purely parallel magnetic wave .",
    "the wave is left - hand circularly polarized and @xmath134 , a plane electromagnetic wave of the form @xmath135 , @xmath136 is left - hand circularly polarized if @xmath137 . ] and in the rest frame of the dense - plasma beam moves antiparallel to the mean magnetic field with phase velocity @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , in the frame of the reverse shock the wave is carried towards the shock with the plasma flow .",
    "the wavelength of the mode is @xmath139 and its frequency is @xmath140 .",
    "these characteristics do not significantly vary over the precursor region .    to understand the nature of the observed parallel mode , a linear analysis has been performed .",
    "it is analogous to the analysis for the filamentation - like mode in section [ emag ] , but uses a modified set of parameters , for the physical conditions in the reverse - shock precursor have changed .",
    "the calculations thus assume a density contrast of 0.05 between the dilute and the dense - ion beam ( compare the average density profiles in fig .",
    "[ mag6]a ) and a tenuous - ion beam velocity of @xmath141 , slightly slower than the initial injection velocity @xmath142 .",
    "the charge and current of the tenuous ions is compensated mainly by returning dense electrons ; electrons of the tenuous plasma represent only 5% of all returning electrons .",
    "we assume the cold - plasma approximation .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ mag6a ] , in which the two - stream electrostatic modes at high wavenumbers are again not shown .",
    "the area of strongest growth at @xmath143 and @xmath144 pertains to an oblique mode , analogous to the nearly transverse mode discussed in section [ emag ] .",
    "the second maximum at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , or @xmath147 , can be identified with our parallel mode .",
    "note , that the growth rates of both the oblique and the parallel modes are comparable to within 6% in the present setup , which was not the case for the analysis of the early - stage turbulence modes in the dense - plasma region , in which a parallel mode can also be observed at @xmath148 but with a growth rate 70% of that of the dominant unstable filamentation - like mode ( fig .",
    "[ mag1a ] ) .    the nature of the parallel mode can be explained by analysis of the dielectric tensor @xmath67 for our system . for flow - aligned perturbations with @xmath149 ,",
    "the tensor @xmath150 takes the form , @xmath151 where the tensor elements @xmath152 are reported in appendix [ ap : tensor ] .",
    "as one can see , the dispersion equation displays three branches , as @xmath153 readily gives @xmath154 the equation @xmath155 defines two - stream like electronic modes at large wavevectors . as already noted , at the time - scale of the present simulations , these modes quickly saturate for warm electron beams . on the ion time - scale ,",
    "the large - wavelength modes governing the system arise from the branches @xmath156 and @xmath157 . when analyzing a simpler setup formed by a dilute - ion beam passing through an electron - ion plasma , the so - called nonresonant ( bell ) mode , as well the resonant one ,",
    "both come from @xmath157 @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the growth - rate profile observed along the parallel axis in figure [ mag6a ] ( and also in fig .",
    "[ mag1a ] ) can equally be traced back to the same @xmath157 branch .",
    "we can therefore identify our parallel mode with the `` bell - like '' mode .",
    "however , the linear analysis predicts a frequency @xmath158 , that is a factor of @xmath159 higher than observed in our simulation .",
    "this indicates that either the cold plasma approach is invalid or the simplified conditions assumed for the linear analysis do not properly represent the conditions in the simulations .    to evaluate",
    "how well the simplified conditions correspond to the state of the plasma system in the simulated reverse - shock precursor and to estimate the effects of a finite temperature , two additional test runs have been performed .",
    "both assume the conditions used in the linear analysis and periodic boundary conditions . in the first run",
    "all plasma components are cold .",
    "we refer to this simulation as to the _ cold test - run_. in the second test simulation , the plasma beams initially have temperatures as measured in the precursor .",
    "this run is referred to as the _ warm test - run_. we found that both test runs well reproduce the characteristics of the initial oblique mode , which is the fastest - growing mode in the linear analysis . the nearly homogeneous density distributions , and the absence of strong density filaments , that are observed in the main simulation , are both well replicated in the warm test - run . in the latter and in the magnetized run m1 , the oblique mode is observed mainly through filamentation in the @xmath84 field component .",
    "the parallel mode appears at a later stage in both test runs .",
    "whereas in the warm run it is the only magnetic mode , in the cold test - run the oblique - mode nonlinear filaments in @xmath84 are clearly imprinted onto the parallel magnetic - field fluctuations .",
    "these characteristics are due to thermal effects that lead to damping of the wave modes with perpendicular components , because the plasma pressure opposes pinching of the filaments .",
    "consequently , the oblique mode eventually dissipates in the warm plasma , and the parallel mode , whose linear growth rate is only slightly lower than that of the oblique mode , dominates the nonlinear evolution .",
    "the parallel mode observed in the test runs has a wavelength @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) , is left - hand circularly polarized , and propagates antiparallel to the mean magnetic field .",
    "the measured growth rate is about half the analytically - derived growth rate , which is consistent with the influence of thermal effects .",
    "these results very well reproduce the properties of the parallel mode observed in the magnetized simulation .",
    "the measured frequency of the mode is @xmath162 in the cold test run and @xmath163 in the warm test - run .",
    "the results of the warm test run are therefore consistent with our main simulation , which indicates that the simplified conditions well represent the real conditions in the simulations and thus our identification of the parallel mode with the bell - like mode is correct .",
    "the differences between the measured mode frequency and that predicted in the linear analysis likely result from thermal effects , that in the nonlinear stage modify the physical conditions , possibly introducing factors not accounted for in the linear calculations .",
    "as one can note in figure [ mag6 ] , the amplitude of the parallel magnetic - field fluctuations considerably increases in the reverse - shock foot .",
    "the latter is the precursor region in which a high - density population of shock - reflected dense ions is present at @xmath164 .",
    "the amplification and compression of the parallel fluctuations thus provides a formation mechanism for the reverse - shock transition that is consistent with the hydrodynamic picture .",
    "note , that although the parallel magnetic mode excited in the precursor region results from the initial conditions , similar unstable modes should appear later on account of shock - reflected dense plasma .",
    "in fact , our linear calculations show that the appearance of the bell - like mode critically depends on the presence of _ returning dense electrons _ in the shock - precursor plasma , and not on the tenuous - ion beam .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the further evolution of the reverse - shock system will be similar .",
    "as in the case of unmagnetized plasma ( run u1 ) , particle distributions are calculated in the rest frame of the downstream plasma , defined by the cd speed @xmath165 in the simulation frame .",
    "although in run m1 the downstream plasma is turbulent on large scales in the cd rest frame , these turbulent motions are slow and do not significantly distort the spectra .    for run m1",
    "we define the forward - shock downstream region as the area of roughly constant plasma compression with ratio @xmath125 , that is dominated by particles of the tenuous plasma whose bulk velocity is similar to that of the cd . at @xmath122 ,",
    "the downstream region spans the range @xmath166 ( see fig .",
    "[ mag4 ] ) .",
    "left of this location is the cd region in which both the dense and the tenuous plasma reside and where additional processes may operate that alter the particle spectra . as for run u1 , to calculate particle distributions we choose a slice of width @xmath97 , now centered at @xmath167 .",
    "the slice is stationary with respect to the cd , and thus the shock front moves steadily away from the location at which spectra are measured .",
    "figure [ mag7 ] presents spectra of tenuous electrons and ions at time @xmath122 .",
    "only the distributions of electrons appear approximately thermalized .",
    "visible also in figure  [ mag4 ] , the distribution function of tenuous ions exhibits a plateau when integrated over any two momentum coordinates , e.g. , @xmath168 , and consequently the kinetic - energy spectrum strongly deviates from a thermal distribution .",
    "isotropy is approximately maintained in the plateau section of the distribution , but not in the wings where the distribution function falls off .",
    "the form of the distribution suggests that the ions have reached stability against parallel electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities . as in the case of the unmagnetized system , in run m1",
    "the total energy content in electrons is roughly the same as that in ions , in fact 2/3 of it .",
    "figure [ mag8 ] details the time evolution of the downstream electron spectrum . at all times for which spectra are presented ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , shown with black , blue , green , and red line , respectively ) , the forward - shock compression is well established in the extended region to the right from the cd , and the electrons are isotropic in the downstream frame ( cf",
    ". run u1 ) .",
    "these spectra display a slow increase in average energy , possibly because the region , in which the distribution is calculated , is located closer to the shock front at earlier times .",
    "all spectra are slightly more peaked than a relativistic maxwellian , which we plot for comparison .",
    "it is interesting to note that renormalizing the spectra to dimensionless energy @xmath173 , @xmath174 being the average particle energy , indicates that the shape of the spectra evolves very weakly , and it is indeed mainly a continuous increase in @xmath174 that is responsible for the spectral evolution .",
    "there is no significant indication of a supra - thermal tail in the electron spectrum .",
    "dense - plasma particles downstream of the reverse shock are sampled in a slice of width @xmath175 , centered at @xmath176 and their energy distributions in the cd rest frame at the end of run m1 are presented in figure [ mag9 ] .",
    "the hydrodynamic plasma compression is fully established in this narrow region at the very end of the simulation .",
    "the electrons and ions carry to within 10% the same kinetic energy . only in the high - energy tail",
    "do we observe a modest anisotropy in the electron distribution .",
    "a maxwellian fits the electron spectrum reasonably well ; a slight discrepancy at high energies coincides with anisotropy .",
    "the ions are anisotropic as well ; a substantial population of returning particles exists that builds a superficial high - energy tail ( see fig .",
    "[ mag4 ] ) , which is therefore not indicative of ion pre - acceleration .",
    "we have performed 2d3v pic simulations of non - relativistic plasma collisions with absent or parallel large - scale magnetic field .",
    "contrary to earlier expectations , simulations by @xcite suggested that weibel - type instabilities can trigger shock formation in an unmagnetized environment even for collisions with non - relativistic velocity , but fast enough to prohibit an electrostatic shock @xcite . a pre - existing magnetic field",
    "may therefore be not necessary for the formation of non - relativistic shocks .",
    "the question we addressed in this study is whether or not the shock structure and the particle spectra reach a steady state , and to what degree a parallel magnetic field renders shock formation more efficient .",
    "a secondary goal was to investigate the efficacy of particle pre - acceleration , which appears needed for their injection into a diffusive shock - acceleration process .    to address these questions",
    "we follow the evolution of the system longer than was done by @xcite .",
    "also , we are interested in asymmetric flows , i.e. the collision of plasma slabs of different density , leading to two different shocks and a contact discontinuity which is self - consistently modeled . emphasis has been placed on setting up the simulations as clean as possible .",
    "the simulation parameters are chosen to be close to those of young supernova remnants , except that we use a reduced ion - to - electron mass ratio , @xmath27 .",
    "about 50 years after the explosion of a type - ia supernova , the density ratio between ejecta and ambient medium is about 10 as assumed here , if the density of the ambient gas is about 1 atom@xmath177 .",
    "the shock velocities are about @xmath178 , a factor of a few lower than in our simulations . in the magnetized case ,",
    "the alfvnic mach number of the forward shock is @xmath64 and that of the reverse shock @xmath65 . here ,",
    "as forward shock we denote the shock propagating into the low - density ( ambient ) plasma ; vice versa the reverse shock travels through the dense plasma , that represents the ejecta .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * both in the unmagnetized and the magnetized case , a double - shock structure builds on time scales of about a thousand ion plasma times , @xmath179 .",
    "the colliding plasmas are initially very cold , so that the sonic mach number in our simulations is high enough to prevent an electrostatic shock .",
    "we show that while non - relativistic shocks in both unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas can be mediated by weibel - type instabilities , the efficiency of shock - formation processes is higher when a large - scale magnetic field is present .",
    "the amplitude of magnetic turbulence generated in the collision region is in the magnetized plasma an order of magnitude larger than in unmagnetized conditions .",
    "the typical magnetization of the ambient medium , into which young snr shocks propagate , given by @xmath180 , is in the range @xmath181 .",
    "our magnetized run with @xmath182 thus probes an upper limit of the sigma parameter , and any realistic formation scenario of parallel shocks in snrs should show characteristics intermediate between the two cases studied here . * in the unmagnetized case , small - scale electrostatic and filamentation - like instabilities operate in parallel and heat the electrons .",
    "eventually , strong fluctuations arise in the density of electrons and ions that lead to the formation of the double - shock structure .",
    "the electron dynamics play an important role in the development of the system .",
    "ion - ion or ion - electron streaming generally drives the turbulence , which is mainly magnetic .",
    "the exact type of an instability , however , depends on the location in the shock precursor and is generally different for forward and reverse shocks .",
    "nonlinearities and the change of conditions during plasma advection toward the shocks render an identification with linear modes difficult . in the magnetized case , filamentation in the dense plasma region is initially more pronounced , which we verify with linear analysis , but it quickly evolves into an oblique mode and nonlinear density fluctuations .",
    "some of the streaming instabilities that lead to the formation of the reverse shock are similar to non - resonant modes that have been discussed in the context of cosmic - ray induced magnetic - field amplification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both the magnetized and unmagnetized systems ,",
    "magnetic - field generation processes lead to stronger magnetic fields downstream of the forward shocks , rather than reverse shocks .",
    "we would thus expect synchrotron emission to originate from the magnetized structure of the forward shock transition , which is in agreement with snr observations . *",
    "the electron distributions downstream of the forward and reverse shocks are generally isotropic , whereas that is not always the case for the ions .",
    "the observed spectra suggest that the electrons have reached a statistical equilibrium and generally carry nearly as much kinetic energy as do the ions , although the latter have not yet reached an equilibrium .",
    "* we do not see any significant evidence of pre - acceleration , neither in the electron population nor in the ion distribution .",
    "note that the shock - surfing acceleration , that reportedly provides fast electron acceleration @xcite , should not operate in situations with absent or strictly parallel magnetic field , because @xmath183 . in our magnetized simulation ,",
    "the alfvnic mach number is slightly below the threshold ( at @xmath184 ) for the electron - acceleration process described by @xcite . and @xcite report efficient electron acceleration to lorentz factors of order 100 in pic simulations of slightly faster plasma collisions than discussed here ( @xmath185 and @xmath186 instead of @xmath187 ) .",
    "in both cases the strong ( @xmath188 ) large - scale magnetic field is assumed to be obliquely oriented relative to the flow axis , which provides for more effective particle reflection in the perpendicular component of the magnetic field at the shock transitions .",
    "being interested in ion dynamics , @xcite present hybrid simulations and a pic simulation of a parallel shock with @xmath189 , about 4.5 times the magnetization assumed here .",
    "they find emergent ion acceleration very late in the pic simulation ( at @xmath190 ) and also during the subsequent evolution captured with their hybrid simulations .",
    "they also find that ion acceleration proceeds to higher energies if the alfvnic mach number is larger , although the injection efficiency decreases . in ion plasma times ,",
    "our magnetized pic simulation has similar duration as that of @xcite , but is nearly 4 times shorter in ion gyro - times on account of the lower plasma magnetization assumed in our simulations .",
    "however , the low alfvnic mach number used in the pic simulation in @xcite suppresses weibel - type instabilities .",
    "they are also not modeled with their hybrid simulations for faster shocks ( their @xmath191 run should be comparable with ours ) . because we demonstate that electron dynamics are important for the evolution of the system , a direct comparison with these results is not possible .",
    "nevertheless , all spectral structures we find coincide with anisotropic distribution functions , suggesting an imperfect ion - beam relaxation rather than acceleration per se .",
    "* we have also studied the effect of the assumed ion - to - electron mass ratio on our results .",
    "we find that although the main characteristics of the long - time evolution of the systems do not critically depend on the mass ratio within the range studied , the detailed mechanisms of reaching a steady state might be modified or even different if the assumed mass ratio is too low .",
    "the timescales for particle - energy equilibration and the efficiency of particle pre - accelaration processes might be overestimated in simulations that use a reduced ion - to - electron mass ratio .",
    "computer resource limitations prohibit us to study the properties of the shock formation for close - to - realistic ion - to - electron mass ratios .",
    "studies of the saturation of the linear phase of purely - transverse ion - driven filamentation instability indicate a very low efficiency of the conversion of the ion beam energy into magnetic - field energy for a realistic mass ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that other instabilities must mediate the shock formation in astrophysical settings . however , the applicability of these estimates to shocks might be limited , e.g. , because they do not consider a nonlinear evolution of the filamentation instability and also not a steadily driven instability .",
    "in fact , recent numerical simulations of relativistic collisions of the electron - ion plasmas demonstrate the formation of the filamentation - instability mediated shocks , whose properties do not significantly change with ion - to - electron mass ratio between 16 and 1000 @xcite . since the characteristics of the magnetic - field generation in our simulations are analogous to these observed in relativistic shocks , we similarly expect the properties of weibel - instability - mediated nonrelativistic shocks will not be substantially modified for a realistic mass ratio .",
    "concerning the energy equipartition between electron and ions , as well as the absence of significant non - thermal tails in the particle spectra , the question arises to what degree residual 2-body collisions in the simulation provide thermalization that in the highly - collisionless space plasma would not be relevant . in space environments",
    "the mean free path for collective plasma interactions is many orders of magnitude smaller than that of 2-body collision",
    ". in pic simulations one uses few computational particles to represent very many real electrons or ions and thus introduces artificial collisionality .",
    "would that impact , and possibly prevent , particle pre - acceleration in our simulations ?",
    "coulomb collisions occur with a minimum impact parameter of about 1 grid - cell length on account of the extended charge distribution used to represent the particle .",
    "there are always many ions and electrons within one grid cell , and therefore substantial shielding will occur .",
    "tests indicate that 2-body coulomb interactions are indeed negligible , but random charge imbalances that arise from a low number of particle per cell are possibly not .",
    "in fact , they can provide artificial scattering on time scales similar to or shorter than the simulation time for electron velocities @xmath192 .",
    "the post - shock electrons , in particular those in the spectral tail , are always considerably faster than that , and therefore we conclude that in our simulations artificial scattering can not suppress the formation of non - thermal tails in the electron spectrum .",

    "consequently , the ion - isotropization rate and the rate of kinetic - energy exchange with electrons are faster .",

    "the forward - shock electromagnetic - turbulence structure in run u2 is analogous to that of run u1 .",
    "the role of the dense - ion beam in magnetic - field generation via weibel - like instabilities and in the amplification of the parallel charge - density perturbations is in run u2 shared more equally between the beam of dense ions and the returning tenuous ions ( compare fig .",
    "[ app1]e - f and [ unm3]e - f ) .",
    "the magnetic - turbulence level in the filamentation region of the shock precursor ( @xmath195 ) is considerably lower for @xmath28 , which results from the higher beam temperatures that cause a serious reduction of the growth rate of filamentation - like modes . *",
    "the tenuous - ion beam that permeates the dense - plasma region left from the cd is much warmer in run u2 ( compare fig . [ app1]f and [ unm3]f ) .",
    "this causes a decrease in the growth rate of the oblique filamentation modes and results in much weaker turbulent precursor to the reverse shock in run u2 ( fig .",
    "[ app1]b ) .",
    "however , an increased efficiency of ion reflection in the cd region leads to an effective decoupling of the dense - ion beam from the tenuous plasma ; the numerous returning dense ions efficiently amplify the magnetic turbulence in the reverse - shock transition .",
    "the detailed structure of the reverse shock in run u2 is thus considerably modified with respect to that observed in run u1 ( fig .",
    "[ app1]a - b for @xmath196 ) .",
    "however , also for mass ratio @xmath28 , the energy density of the magnetic field left of the cd is more than an order of magnitude smaller than in the forward - shock region and the reverse - shock compression does not reach the hydrodynamic limit . *",
    "particle spectra downstream of the forward shock ( calculated in a slice of width @xmath97 , centered at @xmath197 , i.e. , similar location as in run u1 ) are shown in figure [ app2 ] .",
    "whereas the electron and dense - ion spectra display characteristics analogous to those described for run u1 , the tenuous - ion distribution resembles that observed downstream of the forward shock in the _ magnetized _ simulation , m1 .",
    "this includes a plateau section in the momentum distribution , which only slightly deviates from isotropy in run u2 .",
    "the contribution of tenuous ions to the total kinetic energy is , at a level of 38% , the same as in run u1 .",
    "the dense ions instead carry 17% only ; the difference of 8% compared to run u1 is shifted to the electrons which now account for 44% of the total kinetic energy .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the timescales for particle - energy equilibration might be overestimated in lower - mass - ratio simulations .",
    "a slight dependence of the average density profiles on the ion - electron mass ratio has been reported in @xcite . in our simulations , we see a similar effect in the forward - shock profile .",
    "even more significant modifications are observed in the region to the left from the cd .",

    "are also observed in the magnetized runs m1 and m2 .",
    "this suggests that it is the ion - beam temperature , and not the slight change in the magnetic - field strength the ions experience through an increase of their cyclotron frequency , that is responsible for the observed differences in the development of weibel - like instabilities in both runs .",
    "the level of magnetic turbulence in the forward - shock precursor in run m1 considerably exceeds that in run m2 ( fig .",
    "[ app1]h ) .",
    "this is because in the magnetized case the turbulence is generated exclusively via filamentation - like instabilities , whose growth rates falls off with plasma temperature .",
    "note , that the magnetic field decays faster downstream of the forward shock in run m2 . *",
    "the effects of the warm beams on the system evolution are even more pronounced in the region left from the cd . instead of the purely - transverse filamentation - like mode excited in the dense - plasma region by an energetic tenuous - ion beam in run m1 ( see sec .",
    "[ emag ] ) , a much weaker oblique mode is generated in simulation m2 .",
    "consequently , the current filaments are weak and their merging does not lead to the strongly - nonlinear `` magnetic bubble '' effects that in run m1 were largely responsible for the efficient decoupling of the colliding ion beams .",
    "nevertheless , also in this case the system can form the reverse - shock transition at an early stage .",
    "the shock formation is now mediated by a strong filamentation - like instability due to the large number of dense ions reflected in the collision region . * as in run m1 , the formation of the reverse - shock transition at late stage in run m2 involves the amplification and compression of a parallel magnetic bell - like mode .",
    "these processes are responsible for the turbulent - field structure at @xmath202 in figure [ app1]h .",
    "the parallel left - hand circularly polarized mode has properties similar to these observed in run m1 : the wavelength @xmath203 , frequency @xmath204 , and the phase velocity @xmath205 .",
    "note , however , that the reverse - shock compression in run m2 does not reach the hydrodynamic limit by the end of the simulation . * particle spectra shown in figure [ app3 ] display characteristics similar to the distributions derived for run m1 .",
    "however , as is the case of run u2 , the energy - equilibration processes proceed with a slightly faster rate for a lower mass ratio .",
    "the kinetic - energy content of the dense electrons downstream of the reverse shock is in run m2 the same within 0.3% as that of the dense ions , and the electrons are isotropic and thermal ( compare a maxwellian fit to the electron spectrum in fig .",
    "[ app3]a ) .",
    "downstream of the forward shock , the tenuous electrons carry 45% of the total kinetic energy .",
    "an analysis of the time evolution of the electron spectra shows an indication of supra - thermal tails , that were not observed in run m1 . therefore , although the electron spectra in run m2 may be influenced by low statistics at high energies , this result demonstrates that the efficiency of particle injection / pre - accelaration processes might be overestimated in simulations that use a reduced ion - to - electron mass ratio .",

    "<S> electron dynamics play an important role in the development of the system . while non - relativistic shocks in both unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas can be mediated by weibel - type instabilities , </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of shock - formation processes is higher when a large - scale magnetic field is present . </S>",
    "<S> the electron distributions downstream of the forward and reverse shocks are generally isotropic , whereas that is not always the case for the ions . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see any significant evidence of pre - acceleration , neither in the electron population nor in the ion distribution . </S>"
