    "this suggests that the theory of perturbative quantum invariants is quite rich also for 3-manifolds with @xmath6 . shortly after ohtsuki s results appeared , c.  lescop developed another theory of @xmath0-equivariant perturbative invariant using configuration spaces ( @xcite ) , which can be seen as a @xmath0-equivariant version of chern ",

    "as a @xmath0-equivariant invariant of knots in a 3-manifold .",
    "this takes values in a space @xmath7 of jacobi diagrams ( definition  [ def : jacobi ] ) whose edges are colored by rational functions in a formal variable @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   as an invariant of 3-manifolds with @xmath5 by considering the equivalence class of the @xmath0-equivariant invariant of knots with respect to some equivalence relation in the target space .",
    "lescop proved in @xcite in a topological method that the invariant of ( 1 ) is universal among garoufalidis ",

    "lescop s knot invariant can be considered as a configuration space version of kricker s rational invariant @xmath9 for knots defined combinatorially ( @xcite ) , which is universal among finite type invariants of @xcite .",
    "she also proved in @xcite that for @xmath10 with @xmath11 and with trivial alexander polynomial , the invariant of ( 2 ) coincides with the 2-loop part of the invariant of ohtsuki defined in @xcite for 3-manifolds with @xmath5 , up to normalization . in the definitions of lescop",
    "s invariants , a knot @xmath12 in a 3-manifold @xmath10 is fixed and a certain 3-cycle @xmath13 in the boundary of the equivariant configuration space @xmath14 of 2 distinct points in @xmath10 ( @xmath0-covering of the configuration space @xmath15 of 2 distinct points in @xmath10 , definition in  [ ss : equiv - conf ] ) , which is associated to @xmath12 , is considered",
    ". then the 3-cycle has an extension to a 4-chain in @xmath14 with coefficients in the field of rational functions , which is called an equivariant propagator .",
    "for example , the term for the @xmath16-graph in lescop s equivariant invariant is given by the `` equivariant triple intersection '' in @xmath14 among equivariant propagators .    in this paper , we apply lescop s construction to the explicit equivariant propagator of `` al - paths '' given in @xcite .",
    "namely , we introduced in @xcite the notion of al - paths in a 3-manifold @xmath10 fibered over @xmath2 ( definition in  [ ss : al ] ) and gave an explicit 4-chain @xmath17 in @xmath14 by the moduli space of al - paths of a fiberwise gradient @xmath18 of a fiberwise morse function on @xmath10 . roughly , an al - path of @xmath18 is a piecewise smooth path consisting of segments each of which is either a part of a critical locus of @xmath18 ( vertical segment ) or a flow line of @xmath19 ( horizontal segment ) .",
    "then , for example , the equivariant triple intersection of ( parallel copies of ) @xmath17 is given by a generating function of counts of certain graphs in @xmath10 such that each edge is an al - path ( al - graphs , figure  [ fig : al - graph - generic ] ) .",
    "we shall give two results .",
    "first , we take a fiberwise morse function on @xmath10 as an extra structure to define an @xmath7-valued invariant .",
    "we show that our invariant @xmath1 is an invariant of concordance classes of fiberwise morse functions on @xmath10 ( definition in  [ ss : fmf ] ) and of spin structures on @xmath10 ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) , by a bifurcation argument similar to hatcher ",
    "wagoner @xcite .",
    "roughly , concordance of fiberwise morse function is analogous to isotopy of closed braid in @xmath10 .",
    "though the concordance relation looks too restricted , it is enough for defining equivariant perturbative isotopy invariants for nullhomologous knots in @xmath10 .",
    "we will write in a subsequent paper @xcite about the knot invariants which count al - graphs with univalent vertices attached to a knot .",
    "next , concerning ( 2 ) , we modify our @xmath17 in order to utilize lescop s result because unlike lescop s equivariant propagator in @xcite the boundary of @xmath17 does not concentrate on a knot @xmath12 . by adding a bordism in @xmath20 between @xmath21 and a multiple of a 2-sphere bundle over @xmath12",
    ", we give a combinatorial formula for lescop s 3-manifold invariant @xmath3 in @xcite for fibered 3-manifolds with @xmath22 as a generating function of counts of al - graphs ( theorem  [ thm : q ] ) with some geometric correction terms .",
    "we remark that lescop s invariant is actually nontrivial , as shown in @xcite . by using the combinatorial formulas for @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    ", we derive surgery formulas of the invariant @xmath1 ( theorem  [ thm : surgery ] ) and of @xmath3 ( theorem  [ thm : surgery2 ] ) .",
    "the surgery formula suggests that @xmath1 has a property similar to finite type invariant as does the perturbative invariant for homology 3-spheres ( @xcite ) .",
    "this gives another proof of lescop s surgery formula of @xmath3 in @xcite for special kind of 3-manifolds and surgeries , which is simple in the sense that the formula is obtained easily by counting certain graphs in a 3-manifold .    in computing the values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 for concrete examples ,",
