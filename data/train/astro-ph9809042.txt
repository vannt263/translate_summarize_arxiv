    "an ultimate goal of the study of quasar ( qso ) absorption lines is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the kinematic , chemical , and ionization conditions of gaseous structures in early  epoch galaxies and to chart their cosmic evolution . for a comprehensive physical picture of any given absorption system ,",
    "both high resolution spectra of a wide range of chemical and ionization species and the empirically measured properties of the associated galaxies are required . for @xmath10 , shortly following the epoch of peak star formation , the association between mg0.1emii  @xmath11 absorption and galaxies is well established ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and their kinematics , though complex and varied , are consistent with being coupled to the galaxies themselves ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is unfortunate , however , that for @xmath12 , the spectroscopic data of are not of uniform , high quality due to the need for large amounts of space  based telescope time to observe ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "presently , any comprehensive analyses of low redshift systems for which the low ionization species ( i.e.  , , ) have been observed at high resolution with hires / keck ( see churchill , vogt , & charlton 1999b ) must incorporate low resolution fos/_hst _ spectra of the intermediate and high ionization species , especially the strong c0.1emiv  @xmath13 , n0.1emv  @xmath14 , and o0.1emvi  @xmath15 doublets , and of several other important low ionization species .",
    "presently , it is not clear if these low resolution data can be used to place meaningful constraints on the chemical and ionization conditions of the clouds in selected absorbers . in this paper",
    ", we investigated this issue in a pilot study , since an affirmation would imply that a larger sample could be studied using existing data from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "we would then be able to address the broader implications for galaxy formation scenarios based upon the inferred metallicities , abundance patterns , and inferred relative spatial distribution of the low and high ionization absorbing gas clouds .    under the assumptions of photoionization and/or collisional ionization equilibrium",
    ", we developed a technique in which it was assumed that the number of clouds and their kinematics are obtained by voigt profile decomposition of the high resolution spectra .",
    "we then used the lower resolution profiles from the fos data to place constraints on the range of chemical and ionization conditions in these clouds .",
    "we also explored the idea that the could arise in relatively low ionization clouds embedded in a higher ionization and more extended medium ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , we set out to answer three questions : ( 1 ) assuming the clouds measured with hires are photoionized , can we construct model clouds that are consistent with the many low and intermediate ionization species captured in the fos data ? ( 2 ) if so , are we required to infer an additional ( presumedly low density and diffuse ) component to account for higher ionization absorption from , , and ? ( 3 ) if so , can this diffuse component be made consistent with photoionized only , collisionally ionized only , or photo plus",
    "collisionally ionized gas ?    for this paper , we chose the three systems at @xmath16 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 along the line of sight toward pg  @xmath5 ( @xmath17 ) because they are exceptionally rich in low , intermediate , and high ionization ultraviolet transitions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "these species represent a wide range of ionization potentials from 13.6  ev for to 138.1  ev for .",
    "assuming the clouds are photoionized , our goal was to determine if we can obtain useful constraints on their range of chemical and ionization conditions using the fos/_hst _ spectra . within this context , we also explored the possibility of a high ionization ( , , and ) , presumedly diffuse , component . in principle , this high ionization phase could be photoionized , collisionally ionized , or photo plus collisionally ionized gas ( a spatially segregated two  phase high ionization component ) .    for both the clouds and the high ionization phase , the extragalactic ultraviolet ionizing background spectrum of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) for @xmath79 was assumed . using the  @xmath23 detection and constraints measured by thimm ( 1995 )",
    ", we explored the range of allowed contributions ( modifications to the haardt & madau background ) from various galactic spectral energy distributions .",

    ", we verified the above relationships .",
    "when only an upper limit is available on @xmath86 for a given cloud , one has two arbitrarily chosen parameters , [ @xmath91/fe ] and @xmath86 , which together uniquely determine the ionization parameter .",

    ", we assumed that they were identical vis    vis their column densities ( had identical metallicities and abundance patterns ) .",
    "this yielded model clouds with identical @xmath82 , and [ @xmath91/fe ] , but unique @xmath80 , due to their unique @xmath87 .",
    "the allowed range of cloud to cloud variations within a system , if desired , can be obtained from the two relations giving @xmath89 and @xmath94 ( as long as the total @xmath80 is held constant ) .    to narrow parameter space",

    "the doppler parameters of the modeled transitions are determined from the observed @xmath46 parameters and the kinetic temperature , @xmath102 , output by the cloudy models , typically 5000 to 30,000  k. the cloudy temperature is used to estimate the thermal component of @xmath103 , from which the turbulent @xmath46 parameter is computed from the relation , @xmath104 .",
    "the total @xmath46 parameter of any transition can then be estimated from its cloudy thermal @xmath46 and the turbulent @xmath46 . the synthetic spectrum",
    "is then superimposed on the observed fos spectrum and the @xmath47 is calculated pixel by pixel in regions of interest as an indicator of the goodness of the model .      as will be shown ,",
    "the model clouds could not account for even a small fraction of the absorption strengths of the higher ionization species ( i.e.  , s0.1emvi , , and ) .",
    "thus , we postulated a high ionization diffuse component not seen in absorption .",

    "we then explored the possibility that the arises in a few `` only '' clouds while the arises in a diffuse low density high ionization phase that is separate from the clouds , which are separate from the clouds .",
    "the and s0.1emvi absorption profiles were critical for constraining these `` cloud '' models .",
    "we systematically explored if contributions from both photoionization and collisional ionization are consistent with the data . for collisional ionization ,",
    "we have drawn from the equilibrium models of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) , with solar abundances . in these models ,",
    "the relative column densities of various species , including that of neutral hydrogen , are a unique function of temperature for a given metallicity .",
    "thus , under the model assumptions , the remaining free parameter is the temperature .",
    "to do so , we located the lowest ionization level of a photoionized diffuse component consistent with the intermediate and moderately high ionization species , after taking into account the clouds . a collisional ionization model was then tuned to any unaccounted absorption in and .",
    "our intent is to present a general picture of both the cloud and high ionization diffuse component properties within the context of our modeling .",
