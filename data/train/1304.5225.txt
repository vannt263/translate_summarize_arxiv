    "after the discovery  @xcite of a higgs boson at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is now time to confront possible extensions of the standard model ( sm ) with lhc data .",
    "one of the simplest ways to extend the scalar sector of the sm is to add one more complex doublet to the model .",
    "the resulting two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) can provide additional cp - violation coming from the scalar sector and can easily originate dark matter candidates .",
    "more evolved models with additional field content have a 2hdm like scalar sector - as in the case , for instance , of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "2hdms have a richer particle spectrum with one charged and three neutral scalars .",
    "all neutral scalars could in principle be the scalar discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however , data gathered so far allow us to rule out the 125 gev particle as being a pure pseudoscalar state .",
    "hence , we are left with either one of the cp - even states of a cp - conserving model or a neutral state from a cp - violating model  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will present the 2hdm models and in the following sections we discuss in turn how well 2hdms can accommodate lhc data for the cp - conserving and for the cp - violating case .",
    "in this section we present the two versions of the 2hdm to be discussed , one cp - conserving and the other explicitly cp - violating .",
    "the most general 2hdms yukawa lagrangian gives rise to scalar exchange flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) which are strongly constrained by experiment . a simple and natural way to avoid those dangerous fcncs is to impose a @xmath0 symmetry on the scalar doublets , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and a corresponding symmetry to the quark fields .",
    "this leads to the well known four yukawa model types i , ii , y ( iii , flipped ) and x ( iv , lepton specific )  @xcite .",
    "the different yukawa types are built such that only @xmath3 couples to all fermions ( type i ) , or @xmath3 couples to up - type quarks and @xmath4 couples to down - type quarks and leptons ( type ii ) , or @xmath3 couples to up - type quarks and to leptons and @xmath4 couples to down - type quarks ( type y ) or finally @xmath3 couples to all quarks and @xmath4 couples to leptons ( type x ) .",
    "the scalar potential in a softly broken @xmath0 symmetric 2hdm can be written as @xmath5 ~ , \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are complex su(2 ) doublets .",
    "all parameters except for @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real as a consequence of the hermiticity of the potential .",
    "the phases of @xmath8 and @xmath9 together with the ones in the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) will determine the cp nature of the model ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a cp - violating model has three spin 0 neutral states usually denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 while in the cp - conserving case the three cp - eigenstates are usually denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( cp - even ) and @xmath15 ( cp - odd ) . as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "once either a cp - conserving or a cp - violating vacuum configuration is chosen , all charge breaking stationary points are saddle points with higher energy .",
    "hence , the 2hdm is stable at tree - level against charge breaking and once a non - charge breaking vacuum is chosen both models have two charged higgs bosons that complete the 2hdm particle spectrum .",
    "we will focus on two specific realisations of 2hdms .",
    "one is the usual 7-parameter cp - conserving potential where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the vevs are all real . in this model",
    "we choose as free parameters , the four masses , the rotation angle in the cp - even sector , @xmath16 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values , @xmath17 , and the soft breaking parameter redefined as @xmath18 .",
    "the other is an explicit cp - violating model  @xcite . in the cp - violating version @xmath8 and @xmath9 are complex and the fields vevs are real .",
    "existence of a stationary point requires @xmath19 .",
    "because the vevs are real in both models , a common definition for the rotation angle in the charged sector @xmath17 can be used . in this model , besides @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we take as free parameters the masses of the lightest scalars @xmath22 and @xmath23 the three rotation angles in the neutral sector @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "details of the model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we have imposed the following theoretical bounds on both models : we require that the potential is bounded from below  @xcite and we impose unitarity limits on the quartic higgs couplings  @xcite . we have also taken into account the precision electroweak constraints  @xcite . furthermore , we discuss the scenarios in which two normal minima coexist in the cp - conserving potential . in those scenarios",
    "it could happen that we are living in a local minimum and tunnelling to a global deeper minimum could occur .",
    "this deeper minimum would have a different @xmath28 and therefore different masses for the elementary particles .",
    "we call this a panic vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the experimental bounds pertaining to the charged sector apply to both models since the charged higgs yukawa couplings have exactly the same form . except for the lep bounds they all constrain regions of the @xmath29 plane .",
    "the lep experiments have set a lower limit on the mass of the charged higgs boson of 80 gev at 95% c.l . , assuming @xmath30  @xcite with the process @xmath31 .",
    "the bound on the mass is 94 gev if @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "these are model independent bounds as long as the above mentioned sum of brs is one .",
    "values of @xmath21 smaller than @xmath33 together with a charged higgs with a mass below @xmath34 gev@xmath35 are both disallowed by the constraints  @xcite coming from @xmath36 , from @xmath37 mixing and from @xmath38  @xcite for all models .",
    "furthermore , data from @xmath38  @xcite imposes a lower limit of @xmath39 gev , but only for models type ii and type y. we have also considered the most recent bounds from the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations on the @xmath29 plane coming from @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we have considered the lep bounds on the neutral higgs  @xcite .",
    "combining it all , our scans will be performed taking @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 for type i while @xmath43 gev for type ii . for the cp - conserving case",
    "we also take @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 gev and @xmath46 while @xmath16 is free to vary in its allowed range although subject to the above constraints . for the cp - violating model we take @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 while @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) are again free to vary in their allowed ranges , subject to the above constraints .",
    "finally , we note that we do not include the constraint that would result from the anomaly observed by the babar collaboration in the rates @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , which deviates by 3.4  @xmath54 ( when @xmath55 and @xmath56 final states are combined ) from the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the deviation can not be explained by a charged higgs boson from either of the four fcnc conserving yukawa types .",
    "therefore , if this observation is independently confirmed by the belle collaboration not only the sm will be excluded at 3.4  @xmath54 but all 2hdms yukawa types will also be excluded with a very similar significance .",
    "we should point out that there will never be an exclusion of the 2hdm in favor of the sm .",
    "indeed , the models discussed here include the sm as a specific ( decoupling ) region of parameter space . as a result , experiments may exclude the sm in favor of the 2hdm ; they may exclude both ; or they may be compatible with sm , thus restricting the 2hdm extension into a particular ( eventually , small ) region of the parameter space .",
    "we start with the cp - conserving model and randomly generate points in the parameter space such that @xmath45 gev , 90 gev @xmath57 900 gev , @xmath58 900 gev , @xmath59 , @xmath60 gev@xmath61 @xmath62 gev@xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "further , for type i we take 90 gev @xmath64 900 gev while for type ii the allowed range is 360 gev @xmath64 900 gev . in order to use the lhc data we define the quantities @xmath65 as the ratio of the number of events predicted in the 2hdm to that obtained in the sm for a given final state @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 where @xmath13 is the lightest cp - even higgs ( 125 gev ) , @xmath54 is the higgs production cross section , br the branching ratio , and @xmath68 is the sm higgs boson . in our analysis , we include all higgs production mechanisms , namely , gluon - gluon fusion using higlu at nlo  @xcite , vector boson fusion ( vbf )  @xcite , higgs production in association with either @xmath69 , @xmath70 or @xmath71  @xcite , and @xmath72 fusion  @xcite .",

    "it is important to point out that this talk was given in february , 2013 , prior to the updates from moriond .",
    "we have added a subsection regarding the moriond updates below . in figure  [ fig1 ] we present the points in the ( @xmath74 , @xmath21 ) plane that pass all the constraints in type i ( left ) and in type ii ( right ) at 1@xmath54 in green and at 2@xmath54 in blue . also shown",

    "is well approximated by @xmath80 .",
    "this is a very good approximation for most of the parameter space and it yields @xmath81 by setting @xmath82 one obtains the sm - like limit line shown in the picture for negative @xmath16 .",
    "applying the same simplified scenario we obtain for type ii @xmath83 now , when @xmath84 we obtain not one but two lines , the red lines shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the approximate scenarios lead us to the following conclusions .",
    "first , it is very hard in type i to have @xmath79 above 1 .",
    "further , the function @xmath85 is very sensitive to deviations from 1 .",
    "this leads to a larger dispersion of points around the sm - like limit line . regarding type ii , not only",
    "do we get two lines instead of one but the function @xmath86 is now very insensitive to deviations from 1 and that is why the points are all in a narrow band close to each line .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the tension between @xmath79 and @xmath87 excludes all points at 1@xmath54 in type ii , there is still a band in type i close to @xmath88 where @xmath79 is below 1 while @xmath87 can be large .",

    "points survive because all @xmath99 are below one . as expected , the 1@xmath54 region is slightly away from the sm - like limit because , on one hand , the central values of @xmath99 are below one , and , on the other hand , we already saw that @xmath99 are very sensitive quantities in type i.    in figure  [ fig5 ] we now show similar plots for the type ii model . in type ii @xmath99 is not a sensitive quantity . therefore both the 1@xmath54 and the 2@xmath54 points are very close to the two limiting lines ( in red ) .",
