    "the largest members of the local group have not evolved passively , but have experienced interactions that are consistent with hierarchal assembly .",
    "perhaps the most overt signatures of this activity in the local group are the stellar streams that have been detected in the outer regions of m31 ( e.g. ibata et al . 2007 ; tanaka et al . 2010 ) . the location and morphology of the sagittarious dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al . 1994 ) , coupled with the presence of coherent streams in the galactic disk ( e.g. helmi et al . 2006 ) and globular clusters that follow an age - metallicity relation that is distinct from that defined by the majority of galactic globular clusters ( e.g. forbes & bridges 2010 ) , indicate that the galaxy also has not evolved in isolation .",
    "there is evidence that the effects of recent interactions on the properties of the galactic disk have not been as great as they have been on the m31 disk ( e.g. hammer et al .",
    "2007 ) .    as the nearest sc galaxy",
    ", m33 is on a par with the lmc in serving as a benchmark for understanding the stellar content and evolution of late - type galaxies .",
    "however , during the past few years , evidence has been presented that m33 and m31 may have interacted during cosmologically recent epochs , and such an interaction may have affected the properties of the m33 disk .",
    "braun & thilker ( 2004 ) find an hi structure that appears to link m33 and m31 , and bekki ( 2008 ) models this as a tidal bridge that formed during an interaction 4  8 gyr in the past .",

    "( 2009 ) investigate the possible orbital trajectories of m31 and m33 as constrained by their present - day locations and radial velocities .",
    "they conclude that at some point during the past @xmath6 gyr the tidal radius of m33 may have been @xmath7 kpc due to an encounter with m31 , which would have greatly affected the disk of m33 .",
    "simulations discussed by mcconnachie et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also support the notion of an interaction between m31 and m33 that may have disturbed the m33 disk .",
    "their simulations suggest that the pericentric separation @xmath8 gyr in the past may have been as small as 40 kpc .",
    "the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of m33 show signatures of a recent tidal interaction .",
    "the hi in the outer regions of m33 has an s - shaped morphology and is distributed over @xmath9 kpc@xmath10 , with almost one fifth of the gas by mass located outside of the star - forming disk ( putman et al .",
    "2009 ) . while s - shaped structures are classical signatures of tidal interactions in simulations ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , the arms of the hi emission associated with m33 are in the opposite direction of disk rotation , possibly suggesting an encounter in the opposite direction of m33 disk rotation .",
    "the hi in m33 also has a high velocity dispersion when compared with other late - type galaxies , with a mean @xmath11 km sec@xmath4 ( putman et al .",
    "2009 ) . while high velocity dispersions in the outer regions of disks are not uncommon , and have been interpreted as the product of heating by halo sub - structures ( e.g. herrmann et al . 2009 ) , the entire gas disk of m33 is kinematically hot .",
    "block et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that the warp in the ism at 5 kpc could result from the accretion of gas with an angular momentum vector that was distinct from that of the main body of the disk , which might be expected to occur due to an interaction .",
    "finally , while molecular clouds in m33 have some characteristics that are similar to their counterparts in the milky - way and m31 ( sheth et al . 2008 ) , the ratio of atomic to molecular gas in m33 is high , and the fraction of molecular gas in giant molecular clouds is low when compared with the galaxy ( verley et al .",
    "both of these properties are consistent with a disturbed ism .",
    "stars and gas in m33 provide a fossil record of the events that shaped its past .",
    "because of the obvious challenges presented by crowding , much of the previous work on the resolved stellar content of m33 has examined the outer regions of the disk .",
    "there are hints that the orbits of disk stars in m33 may have been disrupted , such that the radial age distribution differs from that in more isolated late - type spirals ( gogarten et al .",
    "in fact , it has been known for some time that stars with properties that are consistent with a disk origin appear at large radii in m33 , as might be expected if the disk was disrupted .",
    "davidge ( 2003 ) found that red giant branch ( rgb ) stars located between 14 and 17 kpc ( 7  9 disk scale lengths ) from the center of m33 have [ m / h ] @xmath12 dex .",
    "this metallicity is higher than expected for stars that belong to a classical metal - poor halo , but is within the range expected for disk objects .",
    "a similar situation occurs in m31 , where moderately metal - rich stars are distributed throughout much of the outer regions of the galaxy ( e.g. bellazzini et al . 2003 ) .",
    "davidge ( 2003 ) , block et al . ( 2007 ) and verley et al . (",
    "2009 ) find evidence of a large population of c stars in the outer disk of m33 .",
    "the discovery of a large number of c stars is suggestive of an elevated star formation rate ( sfr ) 1  3 gyr in the past , which is the likely time of an interaction with m31 ( putman et al .",
    "there are indications that these stars may belong to a population that is distinct from the inner disk population . indeed ,",
    "if  as argued by block et al ( 2007 )  the change that is seen in the @xmath13 m profile is driven by the circumstellar dust contents of m giants and c stars , then this is indicative of a change in stellar content .",
    "block et al .",
    "( 2007 ) further suggest that the formation of the c stars may be tied to the events that caused the warp in the m33 hi disk at r@xmath14 kpc .",
    "barker & sarajedini ( 2008 ) explore the chemical evolution of the outer regions of m33 . the chemical evolution deduced from cmd morphology",
    "does not follow that expected for a closed box ; rather , a time - variable rate of infall is required to explain the enrichment history .",
    "barker & sarajedini ( 2008 ) find that the peak rate of gas accretion occured @xmath15 gyr in the past , during which time 50  60% of all gas that has fallen onto the disk was accreted .",
    "the rate of infall has since plunged , with only 10% of all infalling gas being accreted during the past 3 gyr .",
    "while barker & sarajedini ( 2008 ) discuss these results in the context of protracted disk assembly , the drop in the infall rate some 3 gyr in the past coincides with the timing of an interaction between m31 and m33 as predicted by both putman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and bekki ( 2008 ) . a modest infall rate at the present day would be expected if circumgalactic gas was stripped by an encounter with another galaxy .",
    "past studies have found evidence for systematic radial variations in the star - forming history ( sfh ) of the m33 disk .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the number of young stellar groups drops suddenly at radii @xmath16 kpc , which they attribute to a change in the star - forming ism , and it is only in the central 4 kpc that park et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find clusters with log(t ) @xmath17 .",
    "the impact of systematic gradients in the sfh are also seen in integrated light .",
    "this is demonstrated by munoz - mateos et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who find a radial gradient in the specific sfr ( ssfr ) of m33 based on measurements in the uv and ir .",
    "cioni et al .",
    "( 2008 ) examine the distribution of m giants and c stars in m33 , and find that the c / m ratio peaks @xmath18 arcmin ( @xmath19 kpc ) from the galaxy center .",
    "the radial variation in c / m is likely a product of gradients in both mean metallicity and age , in the sense that younger mean ages and higher metallicities occur at smaller radii . using c / m as",
    "a metallicity indicator , cioni ( 2009 ) finds a progressive radial decrease in metallicity with increasing radius in m33 out to 8 kpc , while at larger radii the metallicity profile is flat .",
    "cioni ( 2009 ) interprets the break in the metallicity profile as an interface between inner and outer disk / halo components .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the m33 disk at visible wavelengths is consistent with insight - out formation ( li et al .",
    "2004 ) , although the radial age distribution of stars may be affected by processes other than the mechanics of disk assembly . williams et al . (",
    "2009 ) use deep acs images to examine stellar content over a range of radii in m33 .",
    "they find that mean age drops as radius increases when r @xmath20 kpc , but at r @xmath21 kpc mean age increases with radius .",
    "such a radial age inversion is consistent with simulations of disk evolution ( e.g. roskar et al .",
    "2008 ; sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2009 ) , and can be understood in the context of inside - out disk formation coupled with the dynamical evolution of disk stars , which causes the outermost regions of the disk to be populated by stars that formed at smaller radii , but have migrated outwards .",
    "the most overt signature of such processes at work in m33 is the difference in scale lengths that characterize the distributions of young stars and old stars , in the sense that old stars are distributed over larger spatial scales than young stars ( e.g. verley et al .",
    "2009 ; davidge et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "metallicity gradients are a natural consequence of disk assembly in a hierarchal universe ( e.g. colavitti et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , if m31 passed close to m33 then tidal forces may have mixed gas throughout the disk , thereby flattening pre - existing gradients in the ism .",
    "rosolowsky & simon ( 2008 ) examine the emission spectra of hii regions that span a range of radii in m33 and find that @xmath22[o / h]/@xmath22r @xmath23 .",
    "this is substantially smaller than the mean [ o / h ] gradient in the 39 disk galaxies studied by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , for which @xmath24[o / h]/@xmath22r@xmath25 , where the uncertainty is the standard error in the mean .",
    "a caveat is that giant hii regions , upon which many of the measurements in the zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1994 ) compilation are based , may define steeper gradients than those computed from all hii regions , regardless of size ( magrini et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "rosolowsky & simon ( 2008 ) find considerable scatter about the mean relation between [ o / h ] and radius in m33 , which they attribute to local inhomogeneities in the ism .",
    "an intriguing result is that hii regions with low [ o / h ] ( and hence presumably low total metallicity ) are found at small radii , suggesting that material that has undergone only modest amounts of chemical enrichment is present in the part of m33 that is expected to be the most chemically mature .",
    "the presence of such material could be due to the tidally - induced mixing of gas from the outer regions into the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , magrini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue that the comparatively low mean metallicity computed for hii regions in the central kpc of m33 may be a result of selection effects in surveys that require the detection of [ oiii]4363 , which is a diagnostic of electron temperature .",
    "still , it is evident from their figure 19 that the mean [ o / h ] in the central kpc remains lower than that at 1.5 kpc even if hii regions that do not have [ oiii]4363 detections are included in the sample .",
    "very young stars might be expected to track the metallicity trends defined by hii regions . however , blue supergiants ( bsgs ) in m33 define a steeper radial metallicity gradient than hii regions ( u et al . 2009 ) , with a slope that is consistent with the mean in the zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1994 ) hii sample .",
    "a possible explanation for this difference in gradients is that u et al .",
    "( 2009 ) do not find stellar counterparts to the oxygen - poor hii regions detected at small radii by rosolowsky & simon ( 2008 ) ; this may be a consequence of the modest number of bsgs studied .",
    "the ages of hii regions and pne differ by at least a few hundred myrs , and so insights into the recent chemical enrichment history of the m33 disk can be obtained by comparing abundance gradients deduced from these types of nebulae .",
    "magrini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that @xmath22[o / h]/@xmath22r = @xmath26 amongst m33 pne , and this agrees with the gradient measured from hii regions by rosolowsky & simon ( 2008 ) .",
    "metallicity gradients are expected to steepen with time if there is infall , and magrini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) attribute the lack of evolution of the [ o / h ] gradient to a low accretion rate during the past few gyr .",
    "such a drop in infall rate during intermediate epochs is in broad agreement with the conclusion reached by barker & sarajedini ( 2008 ) from an investigation of cmds .",
    "alternatively , a static abundance gradient with time could also signal the accretion of gas with low or modest amounts of enrichment , at a fortuitous rate that is sufficient to balance any increase in metallicity that may arise from the recycling of nuclear processed material into the ism .",
    "some properties of m33 may not be typical of late - type spiral galaxies in general .",
    "for example , when compared with other late - type galaxies , the star - forming activity in m33 appears to be subdued .",
    "indeed , while the ssfr of m33 is close to the midpoint of spiral galaxies in general , it is near the low end of galaxies of similar morphological type ( munoz - mateos et al .",
    "the radial ssfr gradient in m33 is also steeper than in the majority of galaxies ( munoz - mateos et al .",
    "this may indicate a low ssfr at small radii , although the circumnuclear stellar content of m33 is similar to that in other nearby late - type spirals ( davidge 2000 ; davidge & courteau 2002 ) .",
    "the gas within 8 kpc of the center of m33 appears to have a sub - critical density for triggering star formation ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) , and this is one possible explanation for the low ssfr when compared with other late - type spirals .",
    "considering the low gas density , the chemical properties of m33 are suggestive of a star - forming efficiency ( sfe ) that is higher than that among other nearby galaxies , and the sfe increases to progressively larger radii ( magrini et al .",
    "that star - forming activity occurs on a large scale in an environment with a low density may be related to the shear rate ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) , which influences the frequency of collisions between molecular clouds , or an increase in ism pressure caused by material falling into the galaxy , coupled with a kinematically hot interstellar environment ( putman et al 2009 ) .",
    "the gravitational field of stars in the disk may also facilitate the collapse of star - forming material ( e.g. verley et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the youngest stars in late - type galaxies play a key role in defining the classical morphological characteristics of these systems , and if m33 has experienced a recent interaction then residual signatures of such an event may be evident in the spatial distribution of these objects .",
    "massive young stars are also brighter than the vast majority of older stars , and so are less prone to crowding in ground - based observations . in the present paper ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 images obtained with megacam on the 3.6 metre canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) are used to investigate the properties of young stars in m33 .",
    "two specific aspects of young stars in m33 are examined in this paper .",
    "first , we investigate the recent sfh of the m33 disk , with emphasis on how it has changed with time and location during the past few 100 myr .",
    "there are considerable uncertainties associated with sfhs that are based on integrated light indicators , and these uncertainties are avoided by employing star counts as a probe of sfh . while area - to - area variations in sfr may occur within a galaxy due to the passage of spiral density waves or stochastic effects , when averaged over long timescales and large areas the sfrs of isolated star - forming disks are expected to be more - or - less constant with time . aside from dense galaxy clusters , where there may be a high - density ambient intergalactic medium , galaxy - wide departures from a constant sfr in intermediate mass galaxies",
    "are likely triggered by tidal encounters .",
    "second , we search for young or intermediate age stars outside of the main body of the m33 disk . one might expect a mixed bag of such objects at large distances from the galaxy center .",
    "the outermost regions of the stellar disk may contain stars that migrated from smaller radii ( e.g. sellwood & binney 2002 ) , while the passage of spiral density waves might generate isolated areas of star formation ( bush et al .",
    "tidal effects may pull gas from the inner regions of disks , and studies of interacting galaxies indicate that star formation is not uncommon in tidal debris fields ( e.g. neff et al . 2005 ) .",
    "tidal interactions can also re - distribute existing stars over large areas ( e.g. teyssier et al . 2009 ) . if a tidal plume formed due to an interaction between m31 and m33 then young / intermediate age stars , that either were present in the disk prior to the interaction or formed during the interaction , might be found in the circumgalactic environment .",
    "an important aspect of this study is the near - complete spatial coverage of the m33 disk .",
    "the only areas missed in the stellar disk are those that fall in the gaps between detector banks .",
    "while crowding is an issue within 2 kpc of the galaxy center , a large fraction of the brightest blue stars are still resolved there with these data (  6 ) .",
    "such complete areal coverage facilitates the suppression of stochastic variations in the sfh that may occur over kpc spatial scales . in this sense , the sfh deduced from our data is more akin to what might be derived from ",
    "say  fiber spectroscopic studies of distant galaxies , rather than from pencil - beam surveys of distinct areas within nearby galaxies that typically cover only a few kpc@xmath10 .",
    "observations in @xmath27 are another important aspect of this program .",
    "the @xmath27 filter is well - suited to investigations of intrinsically luminous main sequence stars , not only because they have effective temperatures that places the peak of their spectral energy distributions shortward of @xmath29 m , but also because of the enhanced contrast with respect to the ( predominantly red ) unresolved stellar body of m33 when compared with filters having longer central wavelengths .",
    "observations in @xmath27 are also beneficial when searching for diffuse ensembles of young and intermediate age stars in the outermost regions of the disk , where the fractional contamination from unresolved background galaxies , the majority of which have red colors ( e.g. davidge 2008 ; mouhcine & ibata 2009 ) , is substantial .",
    "an obvious downside to observing in @xmath27 is that there is increased sensitivity to reddening variations when compared with filters that have longer effective wavelengths .",
    "the distance modulus computed by bonanos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , @xmath30 , is adopted for this study .",
    "this distance estimate is based on a geometric calibration ( the orbital properties of stars in an eclipsing binary ) , and is in excellent agreement with recent distances computed from the properties of b supergiants and acs - based observations of the rgb - tip ( u et al .",
    "galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) compare various distance moduli of m33 , and the results are summarized in their figure 10 . while the bonanos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) value is near the upper end of the distance estimates considered by galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , it still falls well within the scatter envelope . in any event ,",
    "the basic results of this study will not change greatly if a distance modulus that is  say  0.2 mag smaller were to be adopted .",
    "the line - of - sight extinction is assumed to originate in a uniform absorbing sheet in front of m33 , and the adopted total extinction is the result of combining estimates of the foreground and internal components .",
    "the foreground component is taken from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , for which a@xmath31 , while the internal component is that computed for m33 by pierce & tully ( 1992 ) , for which a@xmath32 ; thus , the total extinction is a@xmath33 magnitudes . in ",
    "4 it is demonstrated that this model correctly predicts the mean extinction towards main sequence stars in m33 . still , it should be kept in mind that dust in m33 is not uniformly distributed .",
    "u et al . (",
    "2009 ) find that line - of - sight dust extinctions among bright a and b supergiants vary by @xmath34 magnitude in @xmath35 , with a mean e(b ",
    "v ) = 0.08 .",
    "this mean is consistent with the combined foreground and internal reddening values used here .",
    "it is demonstrated in  4 that reddening variations , as gauged by the width of the main sequence , are not substantial , with @xmath36 throughout much of the m33 disk .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "details of the observations and the photometric measurements are discussed in  2 and  3 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of stars and an assessment of reddening variations throughout the disk are presented in  4 .",
    "the recent sfh throughout the disk is investigated in  5 by comparing the luminosity function ( lf ) of main sequence stars with models .",
    "the spatial distribution of young and intermediate age stars throughout the disk and its immediate surroundings is examined in  6 .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  7 .",
    "this study uses a mix of archival and newly recorded megacam images .",
    "megacam ( boulade et al . 2003 ) is the wide - field @xmath37 m imager on the 3.6 meter canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the detector is a mosaic of thirty six @xmath38 pixel e2v ccds that are deployed in a @xmath39 format .",

    "the locations of the five fields that are discussed in this paper are indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the data for the center field consists of archival @xmath27 and @xmath28 images that were recorded as parts of programs 2003bf15 , 2004bh06 , 2004bh20 , and 2004bf26 .",
    "the majority of the exposures recorded for these programs have similar integration times , lunar phasing , and ( sub - arcsec ) image quality ; hence , they form a homogeneous dataset .",
    "the archival data were downloaded from the cfht archive hosted by the canadian astronomical data center ( cadc ) , and were screened to remove exposures recorded during times of poor seeing , poor transparency , and/or bright lunar phase .",
    "a catalogue of the exposures that were retained for this program is provided in table 1 .",
    "stars in the final combined images of the m33 center field have fwhm @xmath41 arcsec in both filters .",
    "the four other megacam pointings were recorded during semester 2009b , and these sample the northern and southern edges of the m33 disk .",
    "the fields overlap , allowing the field - to - field consistency of the photometric calibration to be checked , while also providing an empirical estimate of random errors in the photometry .",
    "five 150 sec exposures were recorded per field in @xmath28 , and ten 440 sec exposures were recorded in @xmath27 .",
    "the data were recorded during grey time ( i.e. partial lunar phase ) to permit scheduling flexibility .",
    "a linear 5 point dither pattern was employed to facilitate the suppression of bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "stars in the final combined images have fwhm @xmath41 arcsec in both filters .",
    "initial processing of the data , which included bias removal and flat - fielding , was done with the cfht elixer pipeline . to provide images of a tractable size for photometric measurements and to better monitor point spread function ( psf ) variations across the wide megacam field , sub - mosaics of ccds in @xmath42 groups",
    "were constructed for subsequent processing  each @xmath39 megacam ccd mosaic was thus divided into @xmath43 sub - mosaics .",

    "these offsets were removed by using the geomap / geotran tasks in iraf to map the @xmath27 images into the @xmath28 reference frame .",
    "the final processing steps were to stack and combine the sub - mosiac images , and then trim the results to the area of common exposure time .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the psf - fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "the source catalogues , psfs , and aperture photometry that are used by allstar were obtained by running tasks in the daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) .",

    "faint stars in the vicinity of the psf stars were removed in an iterative manner , being subtracted from the images using progressively improved versions of the psf .",
    "allstar iteratively rejects sources that have poor photometric measurements . despite such culling ,",
    "a fraction of the sources in the photometric catalogues produced by allstar have measurements that are suspect , and these should be identified and rejected . as in previous photometric studies of stars in nearby galaxies ( e.g. davidge 2010 ) , sources were culled from the photometric catalogue using criteria based on the uncertainty in the magnitudes calculated by daophot , @xmath44 .",
    "all objects with @xmath45 mag were excised from the catalogues , as useful photometric information can not be obtained for these sources , the vast majority of which are at the faint limit of the data .",
    "in addition , objects that depart from the trend between @xmath44 and magnitude defined by point sources in each field were also removed . as demonstrated in figure 2 of davidge ( 2010 ) ,",
    "the objects rejected in this step tend to be non - stellar in appearance , with the majority being galaxies , stellar blends , or cosmetic defects . at intermediate and brighter magnitudes",
    "this filtering may reject up to a third of all sources .",

    "were only considered to be recovered if they were detected in both filters .",
    "the photometry files produced in the artificial star experiments were also culled using the @xmath44based criteria described earlier .    the incidence of blending and the random errors in the photometry both increase rapidly with magnitude when the completeness fraction drops below 50% , and so the magnitude at which 50% completeness occurs provides a simple metric for gauging the faint end of the useable data range .",
    "the distribution of stars in the m33 disk means that the 50% completeness magnitude changes with location in the central field , and the artificial star experiments indicate that 50% completeness occurs near @xmath53 at r@xmath14 kpc ( 18 arcmin ) , and @xmath54 at r@xmath55 kpc ( 32 arcmin ) . for comparison , 50% completeness occurs near @xmath56 throughout the fields that were observed in 2009b .",
    "the photometry was further characterized by comparing measurements made in overlapping sections of the fields .",
    "such comparisons have the potential of revealing sources of error that are not addressed by the artificial star experiments .",
    "the difference in @xmath46 between sources common to both the ne and nw fields was found to have a roughly constant dispersion when @xmath57 , amounting to @xmath58 magnitudes .",
    "this is larger than predicted by the artificial star experiments , which predict a dispersion of @xmath59 magnitudes at @xmath60 .",
    "artificial star experiments require an input psf , and for ground - based observations the psf typically is constructed from the data .",
    "one consequence is that the uncertainties deduced from artificial star experiments do not account for psf - matching errors , which will be present at some level in all datasets , as it is not possible to characterize the psf in a perfect way .",
    "the ne and nw fields overlap at the edges of the megacam science fields where the psf can vary over small spatial scales , and the constant dispersion in the difference between the photometric measurements in these fields over a range of magnitudes is consistent with the behaviour expected from psf - matching errors .",
    "psf - matching errors due to spatial changes in the psf can be quantified by computing aperture corrections , which are the differences between magnitudes measured using large apertures and those determined from psf - fitting , at various points across a field .",
    "the aperture correction will vary across the field if there are changes in the psf that have not been tracked .",
    "we have computed aperture corrections for bright , isolated sources in the section of the ne field that overlaps with the nw field .",
    "the aperture correction varies systematically with location across the field , in the sense of increasing in size towards the edge of the megacam field .",
    "the amplitude of the variation of the aperture correction is 0.06 magnitudes , which is in excellent agreement with the residual dispersion discussed above .",
    "we thus conclude that psf - matching errors introduce uncertainties of a few hundredths of a magnitude to these data .",
    "the disk of m33 contains a number of young stellar complexes , and the photometry of stars in such systems provides an empirical means of assessing the impact of crowding on the photometry in general . to this end ,",

    "the last three objects are from the catalogue of humphreys & sandage ( 1980 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that these are not star clusters in the traditional sense , but giant star - forming complexes of the type discussed by efremov ( 1995 ) .",
    "the sizes of these complexes may reflect the spatial scales for star formation defined by turbulence ( elmegreen et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these four particular complexes were selected because they are in isolated environments , thereby making their boundaries relatively easy to identify when compared with similar complexes in denser portions of the disk .",
    "the geometric center and radius for each complex were estimated by eye , and the cmds of objects within the extraction regions are shown in figure 3 .",
    "these complexes span a range of source densities .",
    "aperture photometry indicates that ic 113 , a 31 and a 116 have comparable surface brightnesses , whereas a 127 is roughly 1 mag arcsec@xmath10 brighter in @xmath46 and @xmath28 .",
    "even though these complexes are in isolated portions of m33 , there is non - negligible contamination from disk stars .",
    "to allow the extent of this contamination to be assessed , the cmds of sources in an annulus surrounding each complex , that subtends the same total area on the sky as the cluster that it abuts , were also constructed , and the results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the number densities of sources near the faint ends of the background cmds are higher than in the cmds of the adjacent clusters , demonstrating the diminished impact of crowding in the ( comparatively ) low density circumcluster environments .",
    "the main sequence is the dominant feature in the cluster cmds . because young stellar regions do not have hard boundaries , some fraction of the stars in the background regions are almost certainly cluster members ; still , the brightest main sequence stars occur in the young complexes , rather than the background fields .",

    "there is reasonable agreement between the predicted and observed main sequence color of a 31 over a large range of @xmath46 magnitude .",
    "this suggests that the baseline reddening is appropriate for this complex , and that crowding does not appear to affect the photometric measurements .    in the case of a 116 ,",
    "the stars with @xmath61 are well matched by the 10 myr isochrone , but at fainter magnitudes many sources fall redward of the predicted main sequence . because a 116 is a star - forming region then it is possible that the red objects may be stars that have not yet collapsed onto the main sequence .",
    "still , for these to be pre - main sequence stars then the evolutionary tracks of cignoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that there must have been a significant star - forming episode in a 116 within only the past few myr . for comparison , the main sequence turn - off of a 116",
    "is well matched by the 10 myr isochrone .",
    "the agreement between the observations and models is not as good for the other two complexes , with the locus of blue stars falling @xmath62 magnitudes redward of the zero age main sequence ( zams ) for a young population .",
    "this could indicate that a@xmath63 is @xmath64 magnitude higher for these complexes than the baseline value .",
    "the effect of adopting a higher line - of - sight extinction is demonstrated in figure 4 , where the dashed line shows the 10 myr isochrone with a@xmath65 mag additional extinction .",
    "while the agreement with the observed color of the main sequence is improved somewhat with a higher extinction , the agreement at fainter magnitudes remains poor , in the sense that the majority of stars still fall to the right of the predicted zams .",
    "a comparatively red main sequence near the faint end of ic 133 would occur if this structure contains stars that span a range of ages .",
    "indeed , the main sequence in the cmd of this complex can be matched if it contains stars that formed during the past @xmath66 myr .",
    "this timescale falls within the expected lifetime of large star - forming complexes ( e.g. davidge et al .",

    ", even though these are relatively dense stellar aggregates , the photometry of stars with @xmath67 tends to be well matched by model isochrones .",
    "the one exception is a 127 , which has the highest surface brightness of the four complexes studied .",

    "the @xmath116 m relation has been adjusted to account for the slightly larger distance to m33 adopted for the present study .",
    "the zeropoint of the @xmath116 m profile has also been adjusted so that the curve passes through the midpoint of the 10 myr star counts .",
    "the 10 myr star counts define a trend that is flatter than the @xmath116 m integrated light profile at r@xmath75 kpc , indicating that the contribution made by young stars to total stellar mass grows with increasing radius in the central 8 kpc .",
    "in addition , that the 10 myr star counts define a more - or - less linear relation for r@xmath118 kpc suggests that incompleteness is not an issue for these very bright stars throughout much of the m33 disk .",
    "the number density of young stars drops near r@xmath119 kpc , whereas the character of the @xmath116 m profile does not change at this point .",
    "the hi distribution of m33 has been mapped over a large area , and there is a localized maximum in hi emission near 7 kpc ( e.g. figure 3 of corbelli 2003 ) , which is close to the radius at which young stars make the largest contribution to the stellar mass density .",
    "the contribution that the youngest stars make to the total stellar mass drops near r@xmath1 kpc ; the radial distributions of young and old stars in the m33 disk are thus consistent with that found in other systems by bakos et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "in  5 it was shown that the recent sfh of the m33 disk changes near 8 kpc , in the sense that at smaller radii the sfr during the past few hundred myr has been continuous , while outside the break radius there has been reduced star - forming activity over the past few tens of myr when compared with the past few hundred myr .",
    "the drop in the number density of very young stars near r@xmath1 kpc , coupled with the continuous trend defined by @xmath116 m light , suggests that the sfr at large radii was not elevated during intermediate epochs .",
    "rather , it is more likely that the sfr in the outer disk dropped during the past @xmath66 myr .",
    "the decrease in the numbers of young stars at r@xmath120 kpc is probably due in part to the asymmetric distribution of gas in the outer regions of m33 . to the extent that hi traces molecular material , the hi distribution mapped by putman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggests that large portions of the circumdisk environment are devoid of star - forming material .",
    "another factor is that the density of star - forming material throughout the m33 disk is sub - critical ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) , and the probability of breeching the threshold for star formation is low in the outer regions of m33 .",
    "finally , the basic properties of star - forming material may change with radius in m33 .",
    "evidence for this comes from the physical sizes of molecular clouds in m33 , which appear to decrease in size towards larger radii ( e.g. gratier 2010 ) .",
    "such a trend will affect the sizes of star - forming regions at large radii , which in turn may affect the chances of forming massive stars .",
    "we use the star - star separation function ( s3f ) to investigate stellar grouping throughout the m33 disk .",
    "the s3f , which was defined by davidge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is the histogram distribution of separations between all possible stellar pairings .",
    "davidge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) used the s3f to investigate the distribution of main sequence stars in the peripheral regions of m33 , and significant projected spatial cohererence was detected among the youngest stars over separations @xmath121 kpc .",

    "( 2011 ) was found to decrease with increasing stellar age , and it was concluded that star - forming complexes in this environment dissipate over time spans of a few tens of myr .    the s3fs of m33 disk stars in two radial intervals are compared in figure 16 .",
    "the current investigation is restricted to stars in the 10 and 40 myr samples because of the substantial level of incompleteness in the 100 myr sample at small radii .",
    "in addition , as we are interested in stellar grouping on kpc and smaller spatial scales , the comparisons are limited to separations @xmath122 kpc , or roughly one disk scale length . the signal in each interval has been normalized to the number of objects with separations between 0.5 and 1.5 kpc ( 110 to 330 arcsec ) .",
    "the shape of the s3fs in figure 16 differ from those examined by davidge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , in that prominent peaks at moderate separations are abscent .",
    "davidge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) studied a comparatively small area on the sky in the outer disk of the galaxy that included two large star - forming complexes , so that there was a bias towards small separations .",
    "in contrast , the s3fs in figure 16 are constructed from stars that cover large swaths of the disk , so that the influence of single star - forming complexes on the s3f are suppressed .",
    "the s3fs of the 40 myr sample are steeper than those in the 10 myr sample at separations between 0 and 200 arcsec ( i.e. between 0 and 1 kpc ) .",
    "there is thus greater spatial coherence among stars in the 10 myr sample with separations @xmath123 arcsec ( @xmath124 parsecs ) than in the 40 myr sample .",
    "the reduced signal at small separations in the 40 myr sample indicates that stars in the disk of m33 become less tightly grouped over timescales of only a few tens of myr , due to the diffusion of stars from their places of birth .",
    "structures of a tidal origin lack a dark matter cocoon , and so their morphology can evolve over timescales that are short when compared with classical galaxies . indeed , while the dissruption timescale for structures in the outer regions of galaxies is comparatively long ( e.g. johnston et al . 1996 ) , the prognosis for the long term survival of tidal structures is poor , with the vast majority expected to dissipate over time spans of only a few hundred myr ( bournaud & duc 2006 ) .",
    "still , some structures may survive over gyr or longer timescales if the interaction geometry is favorable ; for example , long - lived tidal features may form if the orbit of the perturber is more - or - less coplanar with the disk of the host galaxy ( bournaud & duc 2006 ) .",
    "the stellar content of a tidal feature provides a direct means of probing its history .",
    "a critical piece of information that can be gleaned from the stellar content is the age of the structure , which in turn indicates when the interaction occured . a tidal arm that is pulled from a star - forming disk in an interaction that occured during cosmologically - recent epochs should contain stars that span a wide range of ages , reflecting the extended sfh of the original disk . if the donor was actively forming stars before the interaction then some of the youngest stars in a tidal stream will have formed only shortly before the interaction . however , these may not be the youngest stars in the structure , as stars may form for some period of time after an interaction if local density enhancements persist in the gaseous component of the debris field .",
    "evidence for low - level on - going star - forming activity is seen in extragalactic debris fields .",
    "the nearest example is the region between m81 and m82 ( e.g. de mello et al . 2008 ) , even though the interaction occured a few hundred myr in the past ( yun et al .",
    "in addition to star - forming structures , the m81m82 debris field also contains a number of low density young stellar groupings that appear to have formed during the past few tens of myr , but are not forming stars at present ( e.g. davidge 2008 ; mouchine & ibata 2009 ) .",
    "these objects suggest that there was likely larger scale star - forming activity in the debris field in the not too distant past .",
    "whether or not stars form depends on the conditions in the debris field , including the density of star - forming material .",

    "the substantial contamination by background galaxies notwithstanding , stellar groupings that are associated with the northern and southern end of the m33 disk are evident . of particular note is the distinct spur of objects that extends to the north of the spiral arm , which will be referred to as the northern spur .",
    "similar features do not eminate from the southern portion of the m33 disk .",
    "the cmds of sources in the northern spur and the northern disk , where the latter region is identified in figure 17 , are compared in figure 18 .",
    "these structures have very different stellar contents , in that the northern spur lacks the very bright main sequence stars that populate the northern disk .",
    "the majority of blue sources in the northern spur have @xmath128 , which corresponds to ages in excess of 100 myr .",
    "the northern spur thus does not host obvious on - going star formation .",

    "the outer regions of m33 thus may contain at least one stellar grouping  the northern spur  that coincides with a region of hi emission .",
    "given the evidence for an interaction with m31 as recently as 1 gyr in the past , then the northern spur might be the remnant of a structure that formed due to the interaction , and in  6.5 it is demonstrated that it is part of a much more diffusely distributed structure .",
    "structures of this nature may dissipate over a few disk rotation timescales , or @xmath115 gyr .",
    "there are indications that extremely diffuse intermediate age structures lurk in the peripheral regions of m33 .",
    "while contamination from background galaxies complicates efforts to identify such objects , diffuse stellar aggregates can still be detected using source counts that are averaged over large angular scales .",
    "such structures are hard to detect in unsmoothed star counts .",
    "the distribution of 100 myr objects in all five fields is shown in figure 19 .",

    "this bin size corresponds approximately to @xmath130 kpc , and so is conducive to the detection of objects with spatial scales of a kpc or higher .",
    "a low pass filter was applied to the raw number counts to suppress isolated concentrations of objects that occur on scales of a few hundred megacam pixels , as visual examination indicates that many of these tend to be star - forming knots in moderately distant background galaxies .",
    "in addition to the main body of the m33 disk , four distinct structures are seen in figure 19 .",
    "one of these is a low density extension of the northern spur .",
    "the connection between this structure and the disk is examined further in figure 20 , which shows the distribution of sources in the ne and nw fields , again with @xmath129 megacam binning .",

    "the compact nature of do 3 is suggestive of a background cluster of galaxies .",
    "however , such a rich galaxy cluster is not obvious in the megacam data , and it is significant that  like do 2  do 3 is located close to structure in the hi isophotes shown in figure 1 of putman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which is reproduced in figure 19 .",
    "do 1 is located near the middle of the ne@xmath133nw fields , and is due north of m33 .",
    "it is evident from figure 20 that do 1 may be connected to the main body of the m33 disk and the northern spur by a diffuse stellar bridge , as the sources counts to the south and south east of do 1 are higher than to the north or west .",
    "a tongue of objects also extends south of do 1 , pointing directly to the m33 disk .",
    "do 1 is @xmath2 degree east of the ridgeline of the hi arm mapped by putman et al .",

    "xuv disks occur in only a fraction of nearby galaxies ( e.g. zaritsky & christlein 2007 ) , and the so - called type i xuv disks , in which the uv emission is clumpy rather than smoothly distributed , are likely the result of spiral structure propogating through the outer regions of disks ( bush et al .",
    "2010 ) .    while m33 does not have an xuv disk at the present day ( thilker et al .",
    "2005a ) , there are hints that m33 may have experienced vigorous star - forming activity at large radii within the past few hundred myr .",
    "there is a relative excess of stars that formed @xmath136 myr in the past at distances in excess of 8 kpc from the galaxy center (  5 ) , and azimuthal mixing of tidal streams may contribute to producing such a diffuse stellar component ( e.g. oh et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this being said , at least some of the older stars in the peripheral parts of the m33 disk may not have formed _ in situ _ , but may have migrated there as a result of dynamical interactions .",
    "kinematic heating by sources that are external to the disk but still part of the extended dark matter field of the galaxy might also affect the distribution of stars at large radii ( e.g. de jong et al . 2007 ) .    if star formation in do 1 occured _ in situ",
    "_ then m33 may have had an xuv disk @xmath66 myr in the past .",

    ", m33 is thus an obvious target for understanding the pedigrees of more distant galaxies . in this study , moderately deep wide - field images recorded with the cfht megacam have been used to probe the recent star - forming history of the m33 disk and its immediate surroundings .",
    "main sequence stars that formed within the past few hundred myr are resolved throughout a significant fraction of the @xmath137 degrees@xmath10 that we examine .",
    "our study yields three main results .",
    "first , the lf of main sequence stars indicates that  when averaged over large parts of the disk  the sfr within the central 8 kpc of m33 has not changed with time during the past few hundred myr .",
    "this in turn suggests that the disk has not been disturbed for at least this period of time , given that tidal interactions will affect the sfr by  for example  re - distributing star - forming material .",
    "second , the lf of main sequence stars at distances in excess of 8 kpc from the galaxy center is not consistent with a constant sfr during recent epochs .",
    "in fact , the peripheral regions of m33 are not locations of star formation at the present day , and the projected density of very young main sequence stars shows a steep drop near r@xmath1 kpc .",
    "this radial truncation in the young star - forming disk is a robust result , that is also seen in the distribution of uv light ( thilker et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "third , we have found that the outer regions of m33 harbor diffuse collections of blue objects with photometric properties that are consistent with those of main sequence stars with ages @xmath66 myr . some of these structures appear to emerge from the disk , while others may be isolated .",
    "these structures may be tidal in nature , and/or may be spatially extended areas where star formation occured _ in situ_. the latter interpretation opens the possibility that while star formation at the present day is restricted to within @xmath138 kpc of the galaxy center , during intermediate epochs it may have occured over a much larger region .",
    "the appearance of m33 at this time would have been very different from today , especially in the uv .",
    "[ [ evidence - for - an - interaction - in - the - sfh - and - the - long - term - impact - on - m33 ] ] evidence for an interaction in the sfh , and the long - term impact on m33 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    a centrally concentrated upswing in star - forming activity is one consequence of a tidal encounter with another galaxy .",
    "tidal torques remove angular momentum from gas in the disk , causing it to migrate inwards .",
    "elevated levels of star formation in the inner regions of the galaxy are then triggered as the gas density builds and cools .",
    "pre - existing stars in the disk gain angular momentum via interactions with the infalling gas clouds , and move to larger radii , producing an excess of old and intermediate age stars in the outer disk ( e.g. younger et al .",
    "if there was a recent interaction with m31 then elevated levels of central star formation may have occured in m33  is there evidence of such activity in the resolved stellar content ?",
    "if the disk of m33 is recovering from an uptick in star - forming activity that occured within the past few hundred myr , which is the typical timescale for a starburst , then the sfr should decrease as one moves towards more recent epochs .",
    "such a decrease in the sfr is expected as the gas supply is depleted by star formation and/or feedback .",
    "surveys of m33 star clusters suggest that a large peak in star - forming activity may have occured @xmath139 gyr in the past ( chandar et al .",
    "however , the excellent match between the observed lfs and constant sfr models within 8 kpc of the galaxy center indicates that the global sfr has not changed during the past @xmath140 gyr .",
    "in fact , given that interactions fuel elevated levels of star formation over roughly a disk rotation time ( @xmath141 gyr ) , then the results presented in this paper suggest that an interaction with m31 could not have occured during the past @xmath142 gyr .",
    "studies that examine older stellar generations provide additional constraints as to when an interaction between m31 and m33 may have occured . williams et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that the sfr near the center of m33 peaked during the past 0.5  2.5 gyr , at which time the sfr jumped by an order of magnitude above the level that prevailed 2.5  10 gyr in the past .",
    "the time at which this jump in the sfr occured falls within the constraints set by the present - day positions and motions of m31 and m33 ( putman et al .",
    ". williams et al .",

    "the global sfr during the past few hundred myr has been lower than the long - term average ( williams et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the ssfr of m33 is lower than in most other late - type galaxies ( munoz - mateos et al .",
    "these results are consistent with the depletion of cool gas throughout m33 , as might occur if there was sustained large - scale star formation during intermediate epochs .",
    "the substantial jump in the central sfr during intermediate epochs and the subsequent drop in the sfr since that time suggests that m33 may have experienced a modest starburst ; however , any starburst activity was not so dramatic as to present - day restrict star - forming activity to the central few kpc , as is seen in m82 , where a large fraction of the outer stellar disk has been denuded of gas .",
    "the drop in the infall rate 3 gyr in the past infered from the chemical enrichment properties of the outer disk of m33 by barker & sarajedini ( 2008 ) may be understood in the context of the stripping of the circumgalactic m33 hi reservoir by m31 .",
    "the drop in infall occured at a time that is consistent with the interaction timescales estimated by putman et al .",
    "the disruption of such a circumgalactic reservoir will affect the overall appearance of m33 in two ways .",
    "first , the removal of gas from the outer halo of a galaxy may affect the size of the star - forming disk .",
    "models of ram pressure stripping indicate that star - forming disks contract as the circumgalactic gas reservoir that fuels star - forming material is removed ( e.g. bekki 2009 ) .",
    "of course , the local group environment is such that m33 has not been subjected to significant ram pressure stripping .",
    "still , if the m33 gas reservoir was disrupted tidally then the net impact on the star - forming disk may be similar to that produced by ram pressure stripping : the appearance of a compact star - forming disk for an extended period of time ( presumably a significant fraction of the hubble time ) until an external gas reservoir is restored .",
    "the sharp outer disk boundary at 8 kpc in m33 may be a consequence of a truncated angular momentum content in the circumgalactic gas reservoir .",
    "second , the removal of an external reservoir that replenishes disk gas will change the sfr , and hence the appearance of the galaxy .",
    "if the sfr during the past few hundred myr has been 0.7 m@xmath87 year@xmath4 ( blitz & rosolowsky 2006 ) , then @xmath144 m@xmath87 of stars have formed in the past 0.2 gyr . adopting a 5% star formation efficiency ( inoue et al .",

    "this is sustantially lower than the present - day hi mass of m33 ( putman et al .",
    "2009 ) . to be sure ,",
    "gas is recycled throughout the disk ; still , the point to be made is that m33 is not gas - rich and the sfr , which has been constant for the past few hundred myr , will gradually drop as the disk gas supply is depleted .",

    "gas and stars are expected to have different distributions in isolated disks .",
    "this is due in part to the disk assembly process , as the angular momentum distribution of accreted gas will differ from that of stars that are already present .",
    "however , even in the absence of gas accretion , the distinct dynamical behaviours of stars and gas results in different radial distributions . because of their small cross - sections when compared with typical stellar separations , stars form collisionless systems , while the relatively large cross - sections of gas clouds make them collisional systems .",
    "stars may also evolve into extraplanar systems that are distinct from the gas distribution , even in isolated galaxies .",

    "the gas distribution in these models is roughly flat within the break radius , and gradually decreases beyond this point .",

    "( 2009 ) models .",
    "the general trend of increasing specific sfr with radius in the main body of the disk predicted by the models is also consistent with the relative contributions made by young and old stars shown in figure 15 .",
    "still , the muted evidence for star formation outside of the break radius in m33 is not consistent with the models , and the presence of tidal features in the hi distribution outside of the disk ( putman et al .",

    "the simulations run by bekki ( 2008 ) indicate that m33 may leave a gaseous debris stream near m31 , and fardal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) conclude that the gss may have originated from a spiral galaxy .",
    "indeed , the gss contains stars with a metallicity as high as [ fe / h ] @xmath148 ( guhathakurta et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is consistent with an origin in the m33 disk . the velocity dispersion of stars in the gss ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2004 ) is also consistent with an origin in a kinematically cold environment , such as a disk . finally , the gss is 85 kpc behind m31 ( e.g. tanaka et al . 2010 ) , and simulations suggest that the gss was produced by an object on a highly eccentric orbit ( font et al . 2006 ; fardal et al .",
    "2006 ; 2007 ) , such as m33 .    while some properties of the gss can be rationalized in the context of an interaction with m33 , efforts to link the gss with such an event run into timing issues .",
    "the gss has a dynamical age of a few hundred myr ( e.g. font et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is more recent than the minimum probable age for an interaction estimated by putman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and is not consistent with the time interval during which there has been a constant sfr throughout the m33 disk .",
    "another issue is that the vast majority of stars in the gss have an age @xmath149 gyr ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) , and so fall outside of the nominal age range predicted for an interaction . still , a modest population of young stars is present in the gss ( e.g. figure 17 of brown et al . 2006 ) .",
    "recently formed stars in extraplanar environments may not be well - mixed with underlying stellar material , as they formed in gas concentrations , whereas pre - existing stars will tend to dissipate spatially . if this is the case in m31 then future observations may find concentrations of intermediate age stars in different fields than those sampled by brown et al .",
