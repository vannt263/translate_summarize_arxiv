    "in this work we present some preliminary results about the role scalar fields play in cosmological simulations , in particular on the process of large scale structure formation .",
    "scalar fields have been around for so many years since the pioneering work of jordan , brans , and dicke@xcite .",
    "nowadays they are considered as a mechanism for inflation@xcite ; the dark matter component of galaxies@xcite ; the quientessence field to explain dark energy in the universe@xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the large scale structure formation where the usual approach is that the evolution of the initial primordial fluctuation energy density fields evolve following newtonian mechanics in an expanding background@xcite .",
    "the force between particles are the standard newtonian gravitational force .",
    "now , we will see that we can introduce the scalar fields by adding a term in this force .",
    "this force will turn out to be of yukawa type with two parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3)@xcite .",
    "for so many years this kind of force , the so called fifth force , was thoroughly studied theoretically@xcite and many experiments were done to constrain the yukawa parameters@xcite .",
    "we have also been studying , in the past years , the effects of this kind of force on some astrophysical phenomena@xcite .",
    "the yukawa force comes as a newtonian limit of a scalar - tensor theory with the scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravitation@xcite although other alternatives can be found@xcite .",
    "it is our purpose to find the role these scalar fields play on the large scale structure formation processes .",
    "we start by discussing the standard lcdm model and the general approach in @xmath0-body simulations ( see bertschinger@xcite for details ) .",
    "then , we present the modifications we need to do to consider the effects of a static scalar field and we show the results of this theory for the cosmological concordance model of a @xmath1cdm universe@xcite .",
    "to perform the simulations we have modified a standard serial treecode the author has developed @xcite and the gadget 1 @xcite ( see also http://www.astro.inin.mx/mar ) in order to take into account the contribution of the yukawa potential .",
    "the study of large - scale formation in the universe is greatly simplified by the fact that a limiting approximation of general relativity , newtonian mechanics , applies in a region small compared to the hubble length @xmath4 ( @xmath5 mpc , where @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath7 km / s / mpc , is hubble s constant and @xmath8 ) , and large compared to the schwarzschild radii of any collapsed objects .",
    "the rest of the universe affect the region only through a tidal field .",
    "the length scale @xmath9 is of the order of the largest scales currently accessible in cosmological observations and @xmath10 yr characterizes the evolutionary time scale of the universe .",
    "the newtonian approximatiion can fail at much smaller @xmath11 if the region includes a compact object like a neutron star or black hole , but one can deal with this by noting that at distances large compared to the schwarzschild radius the object acts like an ordinary newtonian point mass .",
    "it is speculated that in nuclei of galaxies there might be black holes as massive as @xmath12 m@xmath13 , schwarzschild radius @xmath14 cm . if this is an upper limit , newtonian mechanics is a good approximation over a substancial range of scales , @xmath15 cm @xmath16 cm .",
    "let us consider a typical scalar  tensor theory given by the following lagrangian @xmath17 + { \\cal l}_m(g_{\\mu\\nu } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] here @xmath18 is the metric , @xmath19 is the matter lagrangian and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary functions of the scalar field . from lagrangian ( [ eqsttlagrangian ] )",
    "we get the gravitational equations , @xmath22 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the scalar field equation @xmath23 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 . the gravitational constant is now contained in @xmath21 and the scalar field get a mass @xmath25 .      in the present study , however , we want to consider the influence of scalar fields in the limit of a static stt , and therefore we need to describe the theory in its newtonian approximation , that is , where gravity and the scalar fields are weak ( and time independent ) and velocities of stars are non - relativistic .",
    "we expect to have small deviations of the scalar field around the background field , defined here as @xmath26 and can be understood as the scalar field beyond all matter .",
    "if one defines the perturbations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the minkowski metric , the newtonian approximation gives @xcite @xmath30 we have set @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the above expansion",
    "we have set the cosmological constant term equal to zero , since on galactic scales its influence should be negligible .",
    "we only consider the influence of dark matter due to the boson field of mass @xmath25 governed by eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) , that is the modified helmholtz equation . equations ( [ pares_eq_h00 ] ) and ( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) represent the newtonian limit of stt with arbitrary potential @xmath21 and function @xmath20 that where taylor expanded around @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting equations are then distinguished by the constants @xmath34 , @xmath2 , and @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is planck s constant .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_h00 ] ) can be cast as a poisson equation for @xmath37 , @xmath38    the next step is to find solutions for this new newtonian potential given a density profile , that is , to find the so  called potential ",
    "density pairs .",
    "general solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) and ( [ pares_eq_psi ] ) can be found in terms of the corresponding green functions , and the new newtonian potential is @xmath39 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_gralpsin ] ) , given by @xmath40 , is the contribution of the usual newtonian gravitation ( without scalar fields ) , while information about the scalar field is contained in the second term , that is , arising from the influence function determined by the modified helmholtz green function , where the coupling @xmath41 ( @xmath2 ) enters as part of a source factor .      to simulate cosmological systems , the expansion of the universe has to be taken into account",
    "also , to determine the nature of the cosmological model we need to determine the composition of the universe , i. e. , we need to give the values of @xmath42 for each component @xmath43 , taking into in this way all forms of energy densities that exist at present .    if a particular kind of energy density is described by an equation of state of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the pressure and @xmath46 is a constant , then the equation for energy conservation in an expanding background , @xmath47 , can be integrated to give @xmath48 .",
    "then , the friedmann equation for the expansion factor @xmath49 is written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 characterizes equation of state of specie @xmath43 .",
    "the most familiar forms of energy densities are those due to pressureless matter with @xmath52 ( that is , nonrelativistic matter with rest - mass - energy density @xmath53 dominating over the kinetic - energy density @xmath54 ) and radiation with @xmath55 .",
    "the density parameter contributed today by visible , nonrelativistic , baryonic matter in the universe is @xmath56 and the density parameter that is due to radiation is @xmath57 . in this work",
    "we will consider a model with only two energy density contribution .",
    "one which is a pressureless and nonbaryonic dark matter with @xmath58 that does not couple with radiation .",
    "other , that will be a cosmological constant contribution @xmath59 with and equation of state @xmath60 .",
    "the above equation for @xmath49 becomes @xmath61 - \\frac{k}{a^2}\\ ] ]    here , we employ a cosmological model with a static scalar field which is consistent with the newtonian limit given by eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_gralpsin ] ) .",
    "thus , the scale factor , @xmath49 , is given by the following friedman model , @xmath62\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the matter and energy density evaluated at present , respectively .",
    "we notice that the source of the cosmic evolution is deviated by the term @xmath66 when compared to the standard friedman - lemaitre model .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to define a new density parameter by @xmath67 .",
    "this new density parameter is such that @xmath68 , which implies a flat universe , and this shall be assumed in our following computations , where we consider @xmath69 . for positive values of @xmath2 , a flat cosmological model demands to have a factor @xmath70 more energetic content ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) than in standard cosmology . on the other hand , for negative values of @xmath2 one",
    "needs a factor @xmath70 less @xmath71 and @xmath72 to have a flat universe . to be consistent with the cmb spectrum and structure formation numerical experiments",
    ", cosmological constraints must be applied on @xmath2 in order for it to be within the range @xmath73 @xcite .    in the newtonian limit of stt of gravity , the newtonian motion equation for a particle @xmath43 is written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the comovil coordinate , and the sum includes all periodic images of particle @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is @xmath78 which , for small distances compared to @xmath3 , is @xmath79 and , for long distances , is @xmath80 , as in newtonian physics .    we now analyze the general effect that the constant @xmath2 has on the dynamics .",
    "the role of @xmath2 in our approach is as follows . on one hand , to construct a flat model we have set the condition @xmath68 , which implies having @xmath70 times the energetic content of the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "this essentially means that we have an increment by a factor of @xmath70 times the amount of matter , for positive values of @xmath2 , or a reduction of the same factor for negative values of @xmath2 .",
    "increasing or reducing this amount of matter affects the matter term on the r.h.s . of the equation of motion ( [ eq_motion ] ) , but the amount affected cancels out with the term @xmath70 in the denominator of ( [ eq_motion ] ) stemming from the new newtonian potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the factor @xmath81 augments ( diminishes ) for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath2 for small distances compared to @xmath3 , resulting in more ( less ) structure formation for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath2 compared to the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "for @xmath82 the dynamics is essentially newtonian .",
    "in this section , we present results of the cosmological simulations of a @xmath1cdm universe with and without sf contribution .",
    "we consider the _ smal box _ initial condition in the cosmic data bank web page ( http://t8web.lanl.gov/people/heitmann/test3.html ) .",
    "the initial condition use a box 90 mpc size and @xmath83 particles .",
    "it is somewhat small as a representative simulation due to lack of large - scale power but straddle a representative range of force and mass resolutions for state - of - the - art large scale structure simulations designed to study power spectra , halo mass functions , weak lensing , and so on .",
    "the initial linear power spectrum was generated using the fitting formula by klypin & holtzman@xcite for the transfer function .",
    "this formula is a slight variation of the common bbks fit@xcite .",
    "it includes effects from baryon suppression but no baryonic oscillations .",
    "we use the standard zeldovich approximation@xcite to provide the initial particle displacement off a uniform grid and to assign initial particle velocities .",
    "the starting redshift is @xmath84 and we choose the following cosmology : @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 includes cold dark matter and baryons ) , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 km / s / mpc , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "these values are in concordance with measurements of cosmological parameters by wmap@xcite .",
    "the simulations we present here use an initial condition with only @xmath92 particles , obtained from the original initial condition by a reduction procedure based on a tree scheme .",
    "this implies that particle masses are in the order of @xmath93 m@xmath13 .",
    "the individual softening length was 20 kpc@xmath94 .",
    "these choices of softening length are consistent with the mass resolution set by the number of particles .",
    "we now present results for the @xmath1cdm model previously described .",
    "because the visible component is the smaller one and given our interest to test the consequences of including a sf contribution to the evolution equations , our model excludes gas particles , but all its mass has been added to the dark matter .",
    "we restrict the values of @xmath2 to the interval @xmath73 @xcite and use @xmath95 mpc@xmath94 , since this scale turns out to be an intermediate scale between the size of the clump groups and the separation of the formed groups .",

    "one notes clearly how the sf modifies the matter structure of the system .",
    "the most dramatic cases are ( b ) and ( c ) where we have used @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . given the argument at the end of last section , in the case of ( b ) , for @xmath102 , the effective gravitational pull has been augmented by a factor of @xmath103 , in contrast to case ( c ) where it has diminished by a factor of 1/2 ; in model ( d ) the pull diminishes only by a factor of 3/4 . that is why one observes for @xmath104 more structure formation in ( b ) , less in ( d ) , and lesser in model ( c ) .",
    "the effect is then , for a growing positive @xmath2 , to speed up the growth of perturbations , then of halos and then of clusters , whereas negative @xmath2 values ( @xmath105 ) tend to slow down the growth .     of a @xmath1cdm universe .",

    "the circular velocity curves where computed using @xmath110 .",
    "the case with @xmath99 corresponds to higher values of @xmath111 , since this depends on how much accumulated mass there is at a distance @xmath112 and this is enhanced by the factor @xmath81 for positive values of @xmath2 .",
    "in general , we can say that even though we have done first numerical simulations using non - minimally coupled sf , the analysis we have done is insufficient to give us a clear conclusions on the role played by sf in the large - scale structure formation process . we will need to do a systematic study of the evolution of the two - point correlation function which is a mesure of galaxy clustering .",
    "we also will need to compute the mass power spectrum and velocity dispersions of the halos .",
    "therefore , we will be able make sistematic comparisons with observations .",
    "however , and in favor of the model , the theoretical scheme we have used is compatible with local observations because we have defined the background field constant @xmath113 .",
    "a direct consequence of the approach is that the amount of matter ( energy ) has to be increased for positive values of @xmath2 and diminished for negative values of @xmath2 with respect to the standard @xmath1cdm model in order to have a flat cosmological model .",
    "quantitatively , our model demands to have @xmath114 and this changes the amount of dark matter and energy of the model for a flat cosmological model , as assumed .",
    "the general gravitational effect is that the interaction including the sf changes by a factor @xmath115 for @xmath116 in comparison with the newtonian case .",
