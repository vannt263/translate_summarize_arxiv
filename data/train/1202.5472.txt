    "the nature of the progenitor systems of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) remains one of the key open issues in stellar evolution .",
    "there is a general agreement that the exploding star is a co white dwarf ( wd ) that is somehow ignited following accretion of material from a binary companion , but the identity of this companion is still a matter of debate .",
    "most theoretical scenarios for sn ia progenitors can be divided into two broad classes : single degenerate ( sd ) systems @xcite , where the companion is a non - degenerate star , and material is transferred over @xmath8 1 myr via roche lobe overflow or wind accretion , and double degenerate ( dd ) systems @xcite , where the companion is another wd , and mass transfer happens over much shorter time scales in a merger event .",
    "recent developments have provided some evidence in favor of the dd scenario .",
    "sensitive searches have failed to find signs of a mass - losing nondegenerate companion in radio observations @xcite , early light curves @xcite and supernova remnants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , but cf .",
    "* , and see ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for some statistical evidence of absorption in sn ia spectra that could be of sd origin ) .",
    "several independent measurements of the delay time distribution ( the specific rate of sn ia as a function of time after a hypothetical brief burst of star formation ) have converged onto a @xmath9 shape extending from a few hundred myr to several gyr ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , a form expected from a population of dd systems that merge due to gravitational wave emission .    in this letter , we present the first measurement of the local wd merger rate and use it to test the viability of the dd scenario for sn ia progenitors . to date , orbital parameters have been measured for over 40 individual dd systems with periods ranging between 12 minutes @xcite and several days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but the fundamental properties of the galactic dd population are still poorly known .",

    ", we adopt a _",
    "statistical _ approach to characterize the dd population , using the unique capabilities of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for time resolved spectroscopy of thousands of wds .",
    "we use this large data set to measure the distribution of @xmath1 , the maximum radial velocity ( rv ) shift between exposures of the same wd . in a companion paper ( maoz , badenes & bickerton 2012 , henceforth paper i ) , we describe how this distribution constrains the binary fraction and the separation distribution . because the evolution of detached dd systems is driven only by gravitational wave emission these parameters , together with the wd masses , uniquely determine the local merger rate , which can be compared to measurements of the specific sn ia rate in nearby milky way - like galaxies .",
    "the sdss @xcite contains the largest available collection of wd spectra @xcite .",
    "the latest version of the sdss wd catalog , corresponding to dr7 , has over @xmath15 entries @xcite entries . ] . for simplicity ,",
    "we have restricted our analysis to non - magnetic da wds that show no obvious signs of main sequence companions , and have no confirmed or possible absorption lines from any elements other than h - i.e. , objects classified as ` da ' or ` da : ' in the catalog , we further removed from this sample seven wds with main sequence companions listed by @xcite , leaving @xmath16 objects .         like all sdss spectra , the spectra of these wds were divided into three or more sub - exposures to facilitate cosmic ray rejection @xcite . since dr7 @xcite ,",
    "these sub - exposures are available from the sdss server .",
    "the ongoing swarms  survey is using these sub - exposures to identify short - period binary wd candidates in sdss , which are then followed up @xcite .",
    "the ds / dt collaboration @xcite has implemented a pipeline to handle cosmic ray rejection and derive stable wavelength solutions for all sub - exposures of the same object .",
    "this letter presents the first results obtained using the ds / dt pipeline ",
    "see @xcite for technical details .    to measure rvs , we normalize each spectrum , dividing it by a highly smoothed version of itself , and we fit four balmer lines ",
    "h@xmath3 through h@xmath17  with voigt profiles in absorption .",
    "we find the best - fit model for each line using mpfit @xcite , an idl implementation of the levenberg - marquardt algorithm . for each sub - exposure @xmath18 , these fits yield four rv measurements rv@xmath19 , and four 1@xmath6 errors @xmath17rv@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . to define a single rv for each sub - exposure",
    ", we impose a threshold on the error of individual rv measurements , @xmath21 , and discard values with larger errors or that deviate by @xmath22 from the weighted mean , rv@xmath23 , with @xmath24 . in sub - exposures with at least _ two _ surviving rvs , we re - calculate the weighted mean rv@xmath25 , and define its error as @xmath17rv@xmath26 . finally , we define @xmath1  as the difference between the highest and lowest rv@xmath25 in each object .",
    "this procedure eliminates noisy sub - exposures with internally inconsistent rvs , effectively culling most wds fainter than @xmath27 19 .",
    "we find that @xmath21=80 @xmath28  is a good compromise between sample size and quality , with 4063 wds and 15,236 rv measurements .",
    "the distribution of rvs and @xmath17rvs in this sample is shown in figure  [ fig - rvdist ] .",
    "the mean of the rv distribution , @xmath29 @xmath28 , is non - zero and positive due to gravitational redshift at the wd surfaces .",
    "this is the expected value for a local wd population with an average mass of @xmath30 @xmath13 , and confirms the @xmath31 @xmath28  redshift obtained by @xcite using a different sample of @xmath32 da wds observed at high resolution .",
    "the agreement shows that our procedure yields well - calibrated rvs .    a key ingredient in the monte carlo models described in section [ sec : drvm - distribution ] and paper i is the distribution of errors , @xmath17rv .",
    "we therefore estimate the errors independently , and compare them to the errors reported by mpfit . for each balmer line of each wd , we find the difference between random pairs of rvs that have similar reported values of @xmath17rv .",
    "these differences have an approximately gaussian distribution , with a @xmath6 that gives an empirical estimate of the true error in the rv measurements , times @xmath33 . using this procedure",
    ", we find that mpfit tends to underestimate the rv errors .",
    "we obtain the corrected @xmath17rv distribution shown in figure [ fig - rvdist ] by running a grid of such pair subtraction tests .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1  values in the @xmath21=80 @xmath28  sample is shown in figure [ fig - deltarv_models ] .",
    "the vast majority of wds have low @xmath1   these are either isolated wds or dd systems where the data show no evidence for significant rv shifts , because the period is too long , or the inclination is too small , or the sub - exposures were taken at similar orbital phases .",
    "however , there is a significant tail of wds with high @xmath1 , extending beyond 500 @xmath28 . from the distribution of sdss sampling times and rv errors",
    ", we do not expect any non - binary wds to have @xmath1  higher than @xmath0300 @xmath28  ( dashed line in figure [ fig - deltarv_models ]  see paper i for details ) .",
    "the eight objects with higher @xmath1  are therefore real binaries , detected at high significance .",
    "some of these are already published discoveries , like sdss 1257 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath1@xmath34 @xmath28 ) , or sdss 0923 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath1@xmath35 @xmath28 ) .",
    "others will be the subject of forthcoming papers .    at intermediate values of @xmath1 , between @xmath0200 and 300 @xmath28",
    "follow - up observations are necessary to tell which of the several dozen wds are real binaries , but here we are only concerned with the statistics of the @xmath1  distribution , not the binary character of individual systems . as a precaution , we have visually vetted the spectra of the 107 wds with @xmath1@xmath36 @xmath28  to check for any misclassified objects , wds with weak line emission , spurious line fits , etc . , and removed them from the distribution .    the monte carlo techniques that we use to model the @xmath1  distribution",
    "are described in detail in paper i. the method involves generating a large number of wd systems with a given binary fraction , drawing the binary separation , @xmath37 , and the component masses from given distributions , assigning random inclinations and phases , choosing the photometric primary , and folding the resulting rv curves through the observational parameters ( sampling times and @xmath17rv distribution ) of the sdss data . because we can only detect binaries at high confidence with @xmath1@xmath38 @xmath28 , there is an upper limit to the separations that we can probe . for an extreme - mass - ratio wd pair with @xmath39 @xmath13  and @xmath40 @xmath13 ,",
    "an rv curve with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 250 @xmath28  corresponds to a separation of @xmath0 0.05 au .",
    "therefore , we define the measured binary fraction , @xmath2 , as the fraction of wds with companions within @xmath41 au .",
    "as explained in paper i , our definition of @xmath2  does _ not _ include an additional population of extremely low - mass binaries with primaries below 0.25 @xmath13 , which we assume are always in short - period binaries ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "to constrain the distribution of binary separations , we model it as a power - law with index @xmath3 at the end of the final common - envelope episode , @xmath42 . in paper",
    "i , we derive analytically the time - evolved form of this distribution due to gravitational wave emission and merger events , integrated over the star - formation history of the galaxy .",
    "this evolved separation distribution is used for generating the simulated wd pairs .",
    "primary masses are chosen from the observed distribution of isolated wds in @xcite .",
    "secondary masses are chosen from a power - law mass - ratio distribution of index @xmath43 . in practice ,",
    "the results have a weak dependence on @xmath43 ( see paper i for details ) , and the analysis we present here assumes @xmath44 .",
    "we choose the photometric primary by random draw , except for @xmath45 @xmath13  secondaries , which we assume are always photometric primaries ( see paper i ) .",
    "each combination of @xmath2  and @xmath3 leads to a predicted @xmath1  distribution in the survey .",
    "examples of such model distributions are plotted alongside the observed one in fig .",
    "[ fig - deltarv_models ] .",
    "this plot showcases the discriminating power of the @xmath1  distribution , in that some combinations of @xmath2  and @xmath3 are allowed by the data , and some are clearly ruled out .",
    "the validity of each model can be quantified by multiplying the poisson probabilities of finding the observed number of systems in each @xmath1  bin , given the expectation from the model . in all comparisons between models and observations , we use only the @xmath1  bins above 250 @xmath28  ( 15 systems in total ) .",
    "the likelihoods of different wd population models are shown in figure [ fig - likcont ] , with the @xmath46 and @xmath47 confidence level contours marked .",
    "lower binary fractions require more negative values of @xmath3 to reproduce the observations , and vice versa .",
    "this is because the tail of wds at high @xmath1  ( i.e. short - period binaries ) can result either from wd populations where many binaries are formed at all separations ( high @xmath2 , more positive @xmath3 ) , or few binaries are formed but with preferentially small separations ( low @xmath2 , more negative @xmath3 ) .",
    "some population models can be ruled out using simple arguments .",
    "we can require , for instance , that @xmath48100% of wds have a companion with p@xmath4812 days ( the circularization limit ) , which would be in conflict with main sequence binary surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we can also require that wds do not merge faster than they are formed , because we _ do _ observe pre - merger systems .",
    "these two conditions rule out the striped regions in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 plane marked in figure [ fig - likcont ] .",
    "with poisson error bars ( black histogram ) , compared to model distributions ( blue , red , orange and green solid curves ) . the dashed black curve is a model with @xmath2=0 . ]    every simulated system has aknown merger time , and therefore it is straightforward to obtain the merger rate for each simulated binary population , whether in total , or for specific cases , such as super - chandrasekhar systems .",
    "the merger rate per wd in the sample can be converted to a merger rate per unit stellar mass in the solar neighborhood using measured estimates of the local wd number density @xcite and stellar mass density @xcite .",
    "curves of constant wd merger rate per unit stellar mass are shown in figure [ fig - likcont ] .",
    "as explained in paper i , the curves appear as straight lines in @xmath49 space .",
    "the slope of the solid lines ( all mergers ) is @xmath50 , where @xmath51  au , and @xmath52  au is the initial separation of a typical wd binary that merges in 10  gyr ( our assumed age of the galaxy ; see paper i ) .",
    "offsets in @xmath3 between merger rates separated by a decade are also 1.5 . despite the broad range of allowed @xmath3 and @xmath2  values ,",
    "the sdss data put stronger constraints on the specific wd merger rate .",
    "the likelihood - weighted merger rate is @xmath53 @xmath5  for all systems , and @xmath54 @xmath5  for super - chandrasekhar systems .",
    "table  [ tab-1 ] gives 95 % confidence levels on these rates , and allowed ranges of @xmath2  for specific values of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite have recently measured the sn ia rate in galaxies of various hubble types . for sbc spirals with the stellar mass of the milky way ( @xmath55 @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the specific sn ia rate is @xmath56 sne @xmath5 .",
    "this number is remarkably close to our measured specific wd merger rate , but an order of magnitude higher than the super - chandrasekhar merger rate .",
    "the implication is that there are not enough super - chandrasekhar dd systems in our local region of the milky way to reproduce the measured sn ia rate through the classic dd channel .",
    "several authors have already pointed out the apparent dearth of super - chandrasekhar sn ia progenitors using qualitative arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis shows this from a quantitative measurement of pre - merger wd binaries .",
    "however , we find a remarkable agreement between the total wd merger rate and the sn ia rate . for our assumed primary and secondary mass distributions ,",
    "@xmath090% of mergers are sub - chandrasekhar , but the total masses are often relatively high  10 - 30% of the mergers are @xmath57 @xmath13 , and 25 - 50% are @xmath58 @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , recent theoretical work has explored the possibility of sub - chandrasekhar co / co wd mergers leading to sn ia ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , see also ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "apart from the consistency between sn ia rates and total wd merger rates , sub - chandrasekhar explosions may have the advantage of producing the correct chemical stratification @xcite , without resorting to the ad hoc delayed detonation mechanism @xcite needed by super - chandrasekhar models .",
    "the measured wd merger rate is also important for estimatimg ` foregrounds ' for gravitational wave detectors @xcite .    , @xmath3 plane , indicating the @xmath46 ( light gray ) and @xmath47 ( dark gray ) confidence levels .",
    "the overlaid color lines are curves of constant wd merger rate , total ( solid ) and super - chandrasekhar ( dashed ) .",
    "the hatched regions are ruled out by requiring that less than 100% of wds have companions with p@xmath4812 days ( upper right corner ) and that wds do not merge faster than they are formed ( bottom part of the plane )  see text for details . ]",
    "unavoidably , our conclusions depend to some degree on the assumptions made in the analysis .",
    "first , all wd samples are flux limited , which could lead to selection effects and unrepresentative values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or the wd mass distribution .",
    "for example , a dd population with a high super - chandrasekhar merger rate may exist , but remain unobserved .",
    "even so , the dd population we observe , with its high merger rate , does exist , regardless of flux limits .",
    "second , we have modeled the initial wd separation distribution with a power law that is independent of mass .",
    "the true post - common - envelope distribution could have some preferred scale correlated with the component masses , which would affect the parameters and merger rates deduced from the @xmath1distribution .",
    "we have chosen primary masses based on the distribution observed by @xcite for sdss wds , which are mostly single , and we have drawn secondary masses from a flat mass - ratio distribution .",
    "these distributions might be different in dd systems .",
    "different mass distributions would only affect weakly the binary population parameters and the total merger rate , but they would have a strong effect on the super - chandrasekhar fraction .",
    "we might have underestimated @xmath1  for some double - lined wd binaries that are unresolved at the sdss spectral resolution , and this would lead to an underestimated merger rate .",
    "conversely , some of the high @xmath1  systems could conceivably be due to faint m star , rather than wd , companions .",
    "however , an m star of low enough mass to go undetected in the sdss photometry , @xmath59  m@xmath60 , and with a period of @xmath61 hour , would only induce a small @xmath1  in the primary wd , e.g. , 220 or 270 km  s@xmath62 , for wds of 0.6 m@xmath60 and 0.4 m@xmath60 , respectively .",
    "such systems therefore can not dominate the high-@xmath1  tail . at the spectral resolution of sdss ,",
    "the combined absorption plus emission line profiles of some wd+m binaries could mimic a large @xmath1 , but this should not occur identically for several balmer lines , so these systems would be removed by our vetting procedure .",
    "finally , we have assumed that the velocity errors are normally distributed , with standard deviations quantified by our empirical tests , but there might be some low , non - gaussian , tails to the error distribution that contaminate the @xmath1  distribution with false positives . in upcoming work , we will address these caveats by investigating the effects of different input assumptions on the conclusions .",
    "we will also improve the purity of our @xmath1  distribution with spectroscopic follow - up of a large number of binary candidates , and use this improved distribution to refine our constraints on the galactic dd population and its merger rate .",
