    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are among the most energetic form of radiation ever detected , with energies apparently reaching beyond 10@xmath2ev . cosmic rays with ultrahigh energies were first detected over 35 years ago by the volcano ranch experiment @xcite . with typical event rates of one per km@xmath3 per century , subsequent experiments including the fly s eye @xcite and agasa @xcite@xcite experiments have observed only a double digit number of events . however , in spite of the paucity of data , a surprising characteristic in the uhecr spectrum has been observed , _ viz .",
    "_ , its apparent smooth continuation beyond @xmath4 ev .",
    "uhecrs appear to be distributed isotropically , indicating an extragalactic origin .",
    "protons traveling from intergalactic distances should experience energy losses owing to photopion production interactions with the 2.7k cosmic background radiation . for a uniform distribution of protons in the universe , even neglecting redshift effects and cosmological source evolution , these interactions would be expected to produce a cutoff in the observed spectrum of uhecrs at @xmath5 ev , commonly referred to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is because of the strong energy dependence in the energy loss rate with energy from photomeson production interactions . as a result , above @xmath6 ev , only protons from within the relatively nearby distance of @xmath7 mpc will survive at these energies to reach the earth @xcite .",
    "the present data indicate , however , a flattening of the spectrum above @xmath8 ev@xcite and no obvious cutoff out to an energy of @xmath9 ev .    two classes of theories have emerged to explain this phenomenon . in one class of theories , `` top down '' , a small branching ratio into high energy nucleons would result from the decays of unstable or meta - stable supermassive particles originating at the grand unified scale or in topological defects produced at that scale .",
    "( most of the energy from these decays goes into the production of pions which , in turn , decay to produce much larger numbers of neutrinos , photons and electrons . )    in the other class of theories , `` bottom up '' , protons achieve their high energies through conventional electromagnetic acceleration processes .",
    "only a few astrophysical sources are presently considered to have the possibility to accelerate particles to ultrahigh energies of the order of @xmath4 ev .",
    "suggested possible acceleration sites include agn jets and hot spots at the ends of radio galaxy jets . for reviews ,",
    "@xcite .    among other origin hypotheses",
    ", it has been suggested that @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) can produce the observed flux of uhecrs@xcite . in such scenarios ,",
    "it has been speculated that uhecrs would be emitted by grbs fireballs with roughly the same amount of total emitted energy as the observed @xmath0-rays in the kev to mev range .",
    "based on this assumption , and also assuming that the grb rate is independent of redshift , it has been argued that the flux and spectrum of uhecrs with energies above @xmath1 ev ( a putative extragalactic component which could account for the flattening and possible composition change above @xmath1 ev@xcite ) is consistent with their production by grbs @xcite .    in recent years , x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows of about a dozen grbs",
    "have been detected leading to the subsequent identification of the host galaxies of these objects and consequently , their redshifts .",
    "the regions in the host galaxies where the bursts are located have also been identified as regions of very active ongoing star formation .",
    "one of us @xcite has therefore argued that a more appropriate redshift distribution to take for grbs is that of the average star formation rate .",
    "one consequence of most grbs being at moderate to high redshifts , is that the gzk effect in the uhecr spectrum produced by grbs would materialize at lower energies and be more pronounced , in stark contradiction to the data . in this letter , we present a detailed calculation of the expected uhecr spectrum which would result from grbs with a more realistic redshift distribution , one following the star formation rate .",
    "to date , some 15 grbs afterglows of long duration bursts have been detected with a subsequent identification of their host galaxies .",
    "at least 14 of the 15 are at moderate to high redshifts with the highest one ( grb000131 ) lying at a redshift of 4.50@xcite,@xcite .",
    "redshift data on grb host galaxies are presently available only for long duration bursts ; the short duration bursts have not as yet been identified with any astronomical sources , however , their source - count distribution is also consistent with a cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "the host galaxies of grbs appear to be sites of active star formation@xcite@xcite .",
    "the colors and morphological types of these galaxies are also consistent with active star formation@xcite as is the detection of ly@xmath10 and [ oii ] in several of the host galaxies@xcite@xcite .",
    "further evidence suggests that bursts themselves are directly associated with star forming regions within their host galaxies ; their positions correspond to regions having significant hydrogen column densities with evidence of dust extinction@xcite@xcite .",
    "a good argument in favor of strong redshift evolution for grbs is made in ref.@xcite based on the nature of the host galaxies .",
    "other recent analyses have also favored a grb redshift distribution which follows the strong redshift evolution of the star formation rate @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one argument for strong redshift evolution for grbs which is independent of the sfr assumption has been put forward very recently .",
    "it is based on correlating the time variability of grb events with the absolute luminosity of the events@xcite .",
    "the relationship is based on seven events and has been extended to to a sample of 224 long , bright grbs detected by batse .",
    "the grb rate was found to scale as @xmath11 which is roughly consistent with the sfr for @xmath12 . for higher @xmath13 ,",
    "the sfr can not be accurately determined because it is strongly affected by dust . as we shall show in the next section",
    ", this uncertainty at such high redshifts does not strongly affect our result because contributions to the observed uhecr flux from such redshifts are negligible .",
    "energy losses of high energy protons from their creation to the present epoch @xmath14 are a result of cosmological redshifting and by pair production ( @xmath15 ) and pion production ( @xmath16 ) through interactions with cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) photons .",
    "we shall assume for this calculation a flat ( @xmath17 ) einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of h@xmath18 = 70 km sec@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and taking @xmath21 .",
    "= 0.7 model does not significantly affect the results . ]",
    "the relationship between time and redshift is then given by @xmath22 and the energy loss owing to redshifting is @xmath23    photopion production is the dominant interaction between uhecrs and the cmb for energies @xmath24 10@xmath2 ev . below energies of 3 @xmath25 10@xmath26 ev",
    ", protons will lose energy mainly through pair production .",
    "the combined energy loss rate for both pion and pair production for protons in collisions with photons of the 2.7k background at the present epoch ( @xmath27 ) is defined as @xmath28    the photomeson loss time is given by stecker@xcite and that for pair production is given by blumenthal@xcite . in order to compute the energy losses due to pion and pair production occurring at a redshift @xmath13 , one must account for the increased photon densities and energies at larger @xmath13 .",
    "the energy of photons increases as @xmath29 and the photon density increases as @xmath30 . the energy loss for photons for any epoch @xmath13",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath31^{-1}.    \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can then calculate the energy e@xmath18(z ) at which a proton is created at a redshift @xmath13 whose observed energy today is e.    in order to calculate the ( number ) flux of protons observed on earth of energy @xmath32 , we follow the formalism derived in berenzinsky and grigoreva @xcite . because of their high energies , we will assume that these protons will propagate along roughly straight lines from their source to the observer , unaffected by small intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "( dropping this assumption increases their propagation time and energy losses so that it would only strengthen our argument . )    the observed flux from a volume element of the sphere @xmath33 is @xmath34 where f(e@xmath18,z ) is the flux of particles emitted at @xmath13 of energy e@xmath18 and @xmath35 is the density of grbs as a function of redshift .",
    "we will take this function to be of the form @xmath36 furthermore with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , changing time to redshift dependence utilizing ( [ eq1 ] ) , and by integrating ( [ eq5 ] ) to the edge of the sphere ( _ i.e. _ out to a maximum redshift @xmath39 ) one obtains @xmath40 assuming a power - law spectrum of index @xmath10 for f(e ) to be generated by the grbs , where f(e ) is the total number of particles per second with energy e observed .    above @xmath8 ev ,",
    "the fly s eye@xcite and agasa data@xcite@xcite are well fit by a spectrum with a power law @xmath41 e@xmath42 . the `` gzk cutoff energy '' for uhecrs versus redshift of origin",
    "is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we have defined this as the energy at which the spectrum drops to @xmath43 of its original value owing to photomeson production .",
    "it can be seen from figure 1 that the protons of energy above ( @xmath44 ev ) can have originated no further than a redshift of @xmath45 or a distance of 130 mpc .    for the redshift distribution of grbs ,",
    "we have have considered three scenarios and corresponding values for the evolution index , @xmath46 . in the first two cases , we assume a value for @xmath10 of 2.75 which fits the data above 10@xmath26ev . for the first case ,",
    "we take an isotropic comoving source density distribution corresponding to @xmath47 out to a maximum redshift of 2.5 . in a second case",
    ", we take a redshift dependence proportional to the star formation rate corresponding to @xmath48 out to a redshift of 2.5 .    for our third case",
    ", we take the redshift distribution for grbs derived from the time variability - redshift relationship for grbs@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath49 out to a redshift of 3.6 .",
    "( it should be noted that there is no observable contribution to the cosmic ray flux from redshifts beyond 2.5 in any case . ) for this case , we assume a flatter source spectrum with a smaller value for @xmath10 of 2.35 . this gives a better fit to the data between 10@xmath50 and 10@xmath26 ev , but requires a larger energy input .",
    "( if we take @xmath10 = 2.75 for this case , we get a very similar result to the second case , but slightly lower fluxes . )",
    "we have normalized our resulting spectra to the fly s eye data at @xmath51 ev and calculated the corresponding uhecr spectra observed at earth under the assumptions for the three scenarios described above .",
    "the results of these scenarios are plotted against the fly s eye and agasa data in figure 2 .",
    "the failure of all three scenarios to fit the observed observed spectrum , particularly for energies above 10@xmath2 ev , is evident . in the scenarios where the source rate follows the star formation rate as a function of redshift ,",
    "the spectrum is significantly steepened from the source spectrum above 10@xmath50 ev , a situation which does not occur in the case of a uniform distribution independent of redshift .    for the @xmath10 = 2.75 cases , the required energy input in cosmic rays above 10@xmath26",
    "ev is @xmath52 erg mpc@xmath53 yr@xmath19 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude greater than the energy release rate from grbs in the 0.01 - 1 mev range @xcite . for the @xmath54 case ,",
    "the discrepency increases to three orders of magnitude , given the required normalization and the flatter source spectrum .",
    "one may speculate that there are numerous nearby low - flux grbs below the _ batse _ threshold .",
    "however , _",
    "batse _ has only detected one burst which may have had an energy release significantly lower than @xmath55 erg , even this event being in doubt @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , there is no reason to believe that such a scenario could overcome the energy discrepency shown above unless much more grb energy is released in uhecrs than in low - energy @xmath0-rays .    our calculated spectrum above @xmath6 ev",
    "may be underestimated owing to the fact that fluctuations in the interaction rate from very nearby sources can allow more protons to reach the earth than our continuous - energy - loss approximation indicates @xcite . however , even with the inclusion of this effect , the predicted energy fluxes from grbs would be much lower than the observations indicate@xcite . with regard to fluctuations",
    ", it has been argued that a few nearby sources could produce the uhecrs @xcite but statistical studies rule this out @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the predicted spectra of uhecrs assuming that the uhecr sources are grbs and that their source density distribution follows the star formation rate .",
    "our motivation is the recent redshift studies of grbs which suggest a strong redshift evolution for these objects .",
    "the results indicate that grbs can not be responsible for the uhecrs observed at earth because their redshift evolution leads to a predicted spectrum which is well below the data , particularly for energies above @xmath4 ev .",
    "in fact , the `` effective gzk cutoff '' for uhecrs of cosmological grb origin is found to be @xmath56ev ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , independent of spectral considerations , if the grb redshift distribution follows the star formation rate , grbs can be ruled out as candidates for the uhecrs based on energetics considerations .",
    "the present star formation rate coupled with the mean energy release per burst leads to an energy release rate per volume which is more than an order of magnitude below the rate need to account for the uhecrs with energies above @xmath4 ev@xcite,@xcite and , as shown in the previous section , two to three orders of magnitude below the rate needed to account for uhecrs above @xmath1 ev , contradicting the hypothesis advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite and stengthening the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the recently launched high energy transient explorer ( hete-2 ) and the swift satellite mission , projected to be launched in 2003 , should eventually provide redshift information for thousands of bursts , including the short duration bursts .",
    "these missions therefore have the potential to conclusively exclude gamma ray bursts as the source of the uhecrs , should the density distribution of the bursts conclusively indicate redshift evolution .    future and planned uhecr detectors such as the pierre auger observatory , and the space - based orbiting wide - angle lens collector ( owl ) satellite system should provide the coverage area necessary to determine the true particle spectrum above 10@xmath2ev .",
    "confirmation of the lack of a pronounced gzk cutoff and an event rate similar to that indicated by present data would also spell the demise for a grb origin of the uhecrs .",
