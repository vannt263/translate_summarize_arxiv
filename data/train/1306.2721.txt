    "in normal - metal/_s_-wave bcs superconductor heterostructure ( nm / s ) , below the superconducting energy gap a spin up or down electron comes into nm / s interface will be reflected as a hole in the opposite spin subband , which is called spin - singlet andreev reflection(ar ) process@xcite and this phenomenon has been well studied by the first - principles approach very recently.@xcite if the nm is ferromagnet ( f ) , the number of propagating states at the fermi energy is different for majority and minority spin owing to the presence of exchange splitting",
    ". therefore only a fraction of incident electron can be andreev reflected and then the conductance of this spin - singlet ar is suppressed significantly.@xcite the most extreme case is the half - metallic ferromagnet ( hf ) with only one spin subband at fermi level , thus the spin - singlet ar process will be totally prohibited in hf / s interface .",
    "however , since the striking observation of josephson current in s / hf / s junction has been reported,@xcite the spin - triplet ar has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years.@xcite it is because that the exotic phenomena such as 0-@xmath1 transitions in s / hf / s josepson junction@xcite may have some potentially applications on superconducting quantum computing circuits . at hf / s interface , the spin - triplet ar means that the incident electrons undergo a spin - flip scattering and penetrate into bcs superconductor as cooper pair , leaving a phase coherence hole in the same spin which can be survived at hf side . so the incident electrons and phase - coherently reflected holes ( or vice verse ) within the same spin subband can induce the spin - triplet superconducting correlation in hf .",

    "it is argued that multichannel scattering theory of propagating states at fermi surface should be taken into account for calculating ar conductance.@xcite moreover , the symmetry of band states when matching wave - function between two bulk crystal has effect on transport properties of the interface , which can be large and should not be neglected.@xcite although the first - principles method has been applied to ar of fe / al interface with spin - flip,@xcite it is difficult to distinguish the spin - singlet and spin - triplet ar in normal f ( with incomplete spin polarization ) , while in full hf there is only spin - triplet ar .",

    "this is because that the magnetic moments of interfacial mn atoms is larger than that of co atoms and for the same deviation angle the atoms with lager magnetic moments can generate stronger spin - flip scattering .",

    "when the concentration @xmath60 the ar spectrum is similar to that of clean interface ( @xmath61 ) and once @xmath35 is greater than 0.2 the conductance peak structure disappeared owing to the random of phase shift at co@xmath0mnsi / al(001 ) interface .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) has the form like multiple beam interference , suggesting the ar conductance is more sensitive to the amplitude of normal - state scattering coefficients and phase coherence of the interface . as a consequence ,",
    "the spread of spin - triplet ar is more pronounced than that of normal - state conductance .    here as a coarse qualitative examination ,",
    "next we only consider the average values of the calculated conductances .",

    "when the interfacial alloy concentration @xmath35 increases up to 0.5 , the spin - triplet ar will go back to be around the value of clean interface .",
    "further , in low concentration @xmath35 the interfacial alloyed atoms can be regard as the impurity at interface , such as al atoms in coco ( mnsi ) monolayer .",
    "hence , our results of ar conductance in co@xmath0mnsi / al(001 ) demonstrate that the impurity at interface can assist the spin - triplet ar process based on first - principles calculations , which agrees with the prediction in the recent theoretic investigation by model hamiltonian.@xcite    from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) one can see that the spin - triplet ar conductance is evaluated by normal - state transmission and reflection coefficients , so the dependence of spin - triplet ar on @xmath35 is mainly dominated by the transparency of interface . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , the normal - state and spin - triplet ar conductance has the similar tendency on @xmath35 , but the relative range of variation is larger for spin - triplet ar .",
    "with increasing @xmath35 , the effect of interfacial alloy can smooth the potential step within the two layers adjacent to interface , hence the electronic structure mismatch between two leads is reduced , which results in lower normal - state reflection and resistance.@xcite for example , in fe / cr interface it has been found the interfacial roughness can raise the conductance by three times.@xcite on the other hand , with increasing the roughness the phase coherence of transport process will be destroyed , which generally suppress the conductance .",
    "so combining the two above - mentioned effects on ar conductance , it is reasonable that the spin - triplet ar will reach maximum at some interfacial alloy concentration @xmath35 .",
    "in summary , in order to study the effect of interfacial magnetic disorder on spin - triplet ar spectra , we calculated the scattering matrices of co@xmath0mnsi / al(001 ) interface in normal - state by first - principles noncollinear transport calculation .",
    "next , combining scattering theory with andreev approximation , we obtained the spin - triplet ar spectra for clean and rough interface with different degree of interfacial magnetic disorder .",
    "the calculated results show that there is a conductance peak below the superconducting energy gap near zero bias for clean interface with interfacial magnetic disorder .",
    "once the fluctuation of magnetic moments directions is sufficient strong or the interface has a small amount of roughness , this subgap conductance peak structure will be smeared out .",
    "in addition , our calculations show that the value of subgap conductance will increase with increasing the interfacial magnetic disorder .",
    "therefore we argue that the reduction of experimental spin polarization from observation of nonzero subgap conductance in hf is owing to interfacial magnetic disorder effect .",
    "meanwhile , the spin polarization of bulk hf is still 100% .",
    "moreover , we also found that for rough interface the spin - triplet ar conductance at zero bias has the maximum value with interfacial alloy concentration around @xmath65 , which suggests that the impurity at interface can enhance the spin - triplet ar process .",
