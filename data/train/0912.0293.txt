    "lyman limit systems ( llss ) are the ` clouds ' along quasar sightlines that have sufficient column density @xmath3  to be optically thick ( @xmath14 ) at the lyman limit , i.e.  @xmath15 .",
    "this definition separates llss from the ly@xmath8  forest lines ( clouds with typical @xmath16 ) which trace the intergalactic medium ( igm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the damped ly@xmath8  systems ( dlas ; @xmath17 ) that trace high redshift protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "on the basis of their intermediate surface density , one may expect the llss to represent the physical interface between the igm and high @xmath5 galaxies .",
    "studies of the llss , therefore , may constrain the accretion history of galaxies and the transport of material back to the igm .    a key tracer of these processes",
    "is the metals intermixed with the gas .",
    "these are presumably formed in the deep potential wells of galaxies , imported to the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernova explosions , and ( possibly ) carried to greater distances by tidal disruption and/or star - formation and agn feedback processes . with the advent of the 10 m keck  i telescope coupled with the hires",
    "echelle spectrometer @xcite , observers demonstrated that a significant fraction of the igm is enriched in heavy elements of c , si , and o @xcite .",
    "more recent studies have established the variation of metallicity with density and redshift @xcite and demonstrate a median metallicity of roughly 1/1000 solar .",
    "these observations constrain the integrated enrichment by galaxies of their surrounding medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the metallicity distribution and evolution in the damped ly@xmath8  systems @xcite , meanwhile , constrain the star - formation history of high @xmath5 galaxies and the processes of ism enrichment @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate that the ism of most high @xmath5 galaxies is metal - poor ( @xmath18 solar ) , that none have a metallicity less than 1/1000 solar , and that a wide dispersion ( 100@xmath19 ) exists from galaxy to galaxy @xcite .",
    "although precise measurements for over 100 damped ly@xmath8  galaxies have been acquired @xcite , constraints on metallicity variations within single galaxies are very limited .",
    "the metal - line transitions generally show absorption by multiple components spanning @xmath20 @xcite , presumably by gas distributed on galactic ( kpc ) scales . the lyman series",
    ", however , is in general too saturated to yield the column densities of the velocity components identified in the metal - line transitions .",
    "therefore , these data provide little constraint on metallicity gradients along the sightline even as a function of velocity much less position .",
    "the studies to date have focused instead on relative abundance ratios within dlas which best trace variations in the gas density , depletion , and/or ionization state @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dlas , the higher order lyman series transitions of llss are often unsaturated and one may ( in principal ) resolve the absorption into multiple velocity components , each with a well - measured column density .",
    "it would then be possible to explore variations in the physical conditions of these components , including the gas metallicity .",
    "this analysis has not been extensively pursued , primarily because of the significant observational demands : one requires high s / n , echelle observations covering the full lyman series .",
    "this demands wavelength coverage @xmath21  for sources at @xmath22 which is observationally challenging .",
    "the analysis , as well , is both time - consuming and limited by the uncertainties of photoionization modeling . with only a few exceptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the only llss analyzed thus far are the rare and special subset of lls that are sufficiently quiescent kinematically to permit a measurement of the d / h ratio @xcite .",
    "researchers have focused instead on the integrated metallicities of the so - called super - lls ( slls ; also referred to as sub - dlas ) with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath8  damping wings for these systems are resolved by high - resolution spectroscopy and therefore allow a precise constraint on their total @xmath3  value . in turn",
    ", the gas metallicity may be estimated subject to photoionization corrections .",
    "it is rare , however , that the full lyman series is observed or analyzed , and absent the @xmath3  component structure one can not study metallicity gradients .",
    "this paper marks the second in a series presenting results on a survey of @xmath10 lyman limit systems . in our first paper (",
    "* ; hereafter paper  i ) , we presented constraints on the frequency distribution of the sllss absorbers with @xmath24 to @xmath25 , from a survey of echelle and echellette data . in this paper , we present our first detailed analysis of a lyman limit system with @xmath26 .",
    "we demonstrate that one can precisely constrain the column densities of the metal - bearing ` clouds ' in such systems when provided with high - resolution spectroscopy covering the full lyman series .",
    "furthermore , we measure the ionization state , metallicity , and relative abundances of the gas through comparisons with models of ionization equilibrium . in this fashion",
    ", we can also explore metallicity variation within the lls , presumably corresponding to galactic ( sub - mpc ) scales .",
    "our target is , a bright ( @xmath27 ) quasar at @xmath28 @xcite discovered by @xcite .",
    "several papers on the subject of absorption systems have targeted this quasar previously @xcite .",
    "these authors characterized the ly@xmath8  forest and the properties of several strong absorption systems along the sightline . in their spectra",
    "the authors describe four metal - line systems with absorption indicative of llss .",
    "two are a close pair at @xmath13 characterized by typical low - ionization lines . based on a measurement of the @xmath29 line",
    ", the authors reported that one of these systems displays an enrichment level comparable to the milky way interstellar medium ( @xmath30 solar ) .",
    "the highest redshift system analyzed is the one responsible for the obvious lls feature below @xmath31 . at @xmath32 ,",
    "this was at the time the highest redshift lls system studied .",
    "limited by spectral resolution , the authors presented only a cursory analysis of its properties .",
    "these absorption systems , especially the lls , are the focus of the current paper ) noted by @xcite has a poorly constrained @xmath3  value and we have chosen not to analyze its properties in detail . ] . throughout the manuscript we assume the solar abundances reported by @xcite .",
    "we observed  with the mike echelle spectrograph @xcite on the magellan ii ( clay ) telescope for two 2,400 second exposures on the night of september 2 , 2004 .",
    "the mike spectrometer uses a dichroic centered at @xmath33to separate the optical light into two cameras where it is collimated and dispersed onto the site 2k  x  4k 15@xmath34 m detectors .",
    "the data was reduced using the mike reduction pipelineburles / www / mike/ ] @xcite which employs novel techniques for the flat fielding , sky subtraction , spectral extraction , wavelength and flux calibration of echelle spectroscopy .",
    "the reduction algorithms also estimate and subtract scattered light detected between the echelle orders .",
    "this signal smoothly varies across the image and has a negligible contribution compared to the sky , even at blue wavelengths .",
    "the resolution of this data is fwhm@xmath35 for the blue data ( @xmath36   ) and @xmath37 for the red data ( @xmath38   ) as measured from a series of well - isolated arc lines .",
    "the signal - to - noise ( @xmath39 ) of the data is @xmath40 per 3 km  s@xmath41  and 4.2 km  s@xmath41  pixel at @xmath424400  and 6000 , on the blue and red sides respectively .",
    "because of the differing spectral resolution , we did not coadd the blue and red - side data in the region of spectral overlap .",
    "instead , we restrict the analysis of features at @xmath43  to the blue - side spectrum and @xmath44  to the red - side data .",
    "the calibrated spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "it is our experience that the relative flux calibration is accurate to within 15% @xcite . to analyze the absorption lines in a quasar spectrum",
    ", one must first estimate its intrinsic continuum .",
    "we fit a series of b - splines and low - order polynomials to our spectrum of by interactively selecting regions where a visible inspection suggests minimal absorption , i.e.  the regions were assumed to reflect the quasar continuum .",
    "this process is augmented with corrections made by hand , generally to maintain a smooth curve .",
    "the continuum estimate is the leading source of systematic error , especially for analysis within the ly@xmath8  forest . at this high redshift , there are few ( if any ) narrow bands of unabsorbed quasar light blueward of the ly@xmath8  emission peak . for spectra with s / n typical of our dataset , it is difficult to avoid a systematic underestimate of the continuum at these wavelengths .",
    "this is especially true for data blueward of the rest - frame lyman limit for the quasar ( @xmath45 ) where absorption from all members of the lyman series may contribute . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] we show our estimate of the quasar continuum as a light dotted line .",
    "the reduced and normalized 1-d spectra are available at http://www.ucolick.org/@xmath46xavier/lls .",
    "in this section , we discuss the techniques and measurement of ionic column densities for the gas comprising the lls at @xmath47 toward .",
    "an analysis of the column densities for the sllss at @xmath48 is presented in appendix  [ sec : appx ] .",
    "the standard method of characterizing an absorption line is with a voigt profile described by three physical parameters : the redshift @xmath5 , the column density @xmath49 , and the doppler parameter ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "these values bear upon the physical quantities that determine the gas ionization , most importantly the spatial density , kinematics , and temperature . to fit for these parameters",
    ", we employed the vpfit software package kindly provided by r. carswell and j. webbrfc / vpfit.html ] . for this software package , the user supplies ( 1 ) spectral regions for analysis , ( 2 ) a list of components with ions specified , ( 3 ) initial guesses for the parameter values , and ( 4 ) the spectral line - profile parameterized here as a gaussian with fwhm estimated from the thar data . in our analysis",
    ", we have generally avoided spectral regions that are significantly blended with coincident ly@xmath8  forest absorption or coincident metal - line absorption .",
    "we typically have constrained the low - ion , si@xmath12 , fe@xmath12 ) .",
    "these atoms and ions are the dominant ionization state in a neutral hydrogen gas where a significant far - uv ( @xmath51ev ) radiation field is present . ]",
    "components of a system to have identical redshift so that the redshift for each set of low - ion transitions of a given component are parameterized by a single value .",
    "this constraint is observationally motivated by the good alignment between the absorption lines in velocity space . for lyman lines , which suffer from significant line - blending",
    ", we have anchored their redshift to the value derived from an independent fit of the metal - line transitions .",
    "this presumes that the absorption traces the low - ion profiles in velocity space , but the relative column densities are allowed to vary freely from component to component .",
    "unfortunately , in the lls presented here the line - blending is too severe to test the former assumption empirically .",
    "future analysis of the other lls in our survey will address this point although we note that such analysis is best performed in the low redshift universe where line - blending with the ly@xmath8  forest , is minimized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for lines analyzed within the ly@xmath8  forest",
    "we allow for a systematic uncertainty in the continuum placement of 10% .",
    "this error does not dominate in any of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "in general , our fits adopt the fewest components which yield reduced @xmath52 values near unity .",
    "we complement this line - profile analysis with ionic column densities measured from the apparent optical depth method ( aodm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the aodm",
    ", one converts the observed normalized flux profile ( @xmath53 ) to an apparent optical depth array @xmath54 and then sums over the velocity interval of the line - profile to calculate the integrated column density .",
    "this non - parametric technique provides accurate results for well - resolved profiles .",
    "it also provides conservative upper and lower limits for undetected or saturated lines . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt these limits where appropriate .",
    "upper limits correspond to @xmath55 statistical uncertainties and lower limits correspond to the column densities by demanding @xmath56 in every pixel . finally , the aodm analysis is useful for identifying unresolved components ( hidden saturation ) by comparing the column densities of a series of transitions with different oscillator strengths from a single ion .",
    "this analysis is especially appropriate for our dataset because the spectral resolution is lower than the echelle data commonly used in quasar absorption line studies .",
    "for the atomic data , we have relied on the compilation of atomic data given by @xcite .",
    "the absorption system at @xmath47 gives rise to the strong lyman limit observed in the spectrum of   ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) and , therefore , is the only lls showing the complete lyman series .",
    "as demonstrated below , spectral coverage that includes the entire lyman series is crucial to precisely constraining the column density .",
    "we place a lower limit on the total column density of this lls by estimating an upper limit to the normalized flux shortward of the lyman limit . in the spectral window @xmath57",
    ", we measure an upper limit to the normalized flux @xmath58 ( 95@xmath59 c.l . ) where we have conservatively allowed for a 50% lower continuum then presented in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "this implies a lower limit to the total column density of the lls , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is evaluated at @xmath63}$]ryd .",
    "this assumes that the contribution of coincident absorption by the igm and metal - lines is minor , which is reasonable for wavelengths longward of the next lower redshift llss .",

    "the profile assuming @xmath68 significantly underpredicts the flux at @xmath69 . given that the flux at these wavelengths is further depressed by the ` clouds ' centered at @xmath70  and 5540 , we adopt a conservative upper limit to the @xmath3  value at @xmath67 of @xmath66 . [",

    "the profile assuming @xmath68 significantly underpredicts the flux at @xmath69 , especially if one accounts for the additional ly@xmath8  absorption from the clouds at @xmath70  and 5540 .",
    "we adopt a conservative upper limit for the gas at @xmath67 of @xmath71 .    a line - profile analysis of the full lyman series will , in principle , give a more precise constraint on the column density of the lls .",
    "furthermore , such an analysis may also resolve the system into multiple velocity components .",
    "there are several challenges , however , to this analysis : ( i ) the various components of the lls may blend with one another , especially in the higher - order lyman series transitions ; ( ii ) the lyman series of the lls is severely blended with the lower redshift igm ; and ( iii ) the majority of lines lie on the flat portion of the curve - of - growth implying a significant degeneracy between @xmath72 and @xmath3 .",
    "we address the first concern ( in part ) by demanding that the strongest clouds have identical redshift as the strongest low - ion absorption .",
    "this requirement follows from the assumption that low - ions primarily arise in regions of large surface density of gas that can self - shield the material from ionizing photons .",
    "we address the second point by avoiding severely blended lines . on the third point",
    ", we consider physically plausible values for the doppler parameter and adopt the corresponding @xmath3  constraints .",

    "it is possible to achieve an acceptable model where the @xmath72-values are identical between the low and high - ions , but this would require the inclusions of yet further components . the profile model presented here is the simplest one that reproduces the observations .",
    "we return to this point when discussing photoionization models of the system ( @xmath85  [ sec : photo ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that the regions containing the transitions of the and doublets are hopelessly blended with coincident igm features .",
    "the redshifts of the strongest low - ion component in each of the subsystems were then taken as an input constraint for the lyman series analysis . in figure",
    "[ fig : z355hi ] , we present a subset of the lyman series transitions and also a portion of the data near the lyman limit .",
    "it is evident that the strongest , highly saturated members of the lyman series offer only a weak constraint on the column densities of the subsystems .",
    "we first visually identified spectral regions that were most likely to constrain the strongest components of subsystems a , b , and c. we then inputted to vpfit these regions , a set of absorption lines at the redshifts of each subsystem ( @xmath86 ) , and additional lines within subsystem  b ( with @xmath87 ) to model additional absorption evident in the lyman series .",
    "the non - zero flux at @xmath88 in the high - order lyman series lines ( e.g.   918 , 919 ) indicates that the integrated column densities of these additional components is significantly lower than the column density of subsystem  c and possibly subsystem  b. we can set a conservative upper limit to the total @xmath3  of this gas by integrating the apparent optical depth of the  918 profile in the interval @xmath89 to @xmath90 , finding @xmath91 ( 95@xmath59 c.l . ) .",

    "although large dispersions in gas metallicities have been reported for the intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is also possible that such a systematic effect afflicts current studies of the predominantly ionized sllss @xcite . in a predominantly ionized gas , it is of primary importance to precisely constrain the ionization state of the component that dominates the column density ( here subsystem  c ) because this gas may dominate the total @xmath6 value .",
    "another important result presented here relates to using the o@xmath11/h@xmath11  ratio to assess the metallicity of llss .",
    "it has been conventional wisdom in the ism and qal communities that the o@xmath11/h@xmath11  ratio is an excellent predictor of o / h abundance because : ( i ) charge exchange reactions between o@xmath11 and h@xmath11 imply similar ionization fractions for these atoms ( i.e.  o@xmath11/o @xmath327 h@xmath11/h ) ; and ( ii ) oxygen contributes significantly to the metal mass density of chemically enriched gas .",
    "the first point is valid even for gas subjected to an intense ionizing radiation field but only for radiation with a soft spectrum ( stellar dominated ) . a hard radiation field ( e.g.quasar dominated )",
    "is predicted to overionize o@xmath11 with respect to h@xmath11 because o@xmath11 has a higher cross - section to hard photons @xcite .",
    "as figure  [ fig : llscldy ] indicates , a highly ionized gas subjected to a hard radiation field ( e.g.  an lls subjected to the euvb ) should exhibit an o@xmath11/h@xmath11  ratio that underpredicts the true o / h value .",
    "this behavior is evidenced in subsystem  c of the lls where we report the positive detection of  1304 while no absorption from  1302 is measured . in this case",
    ", the o@xmath11/h@xmath11  ratio may underpredict the o / h abundance . in subsystem  b , however , we tentatively report the positive detection of  1302 which suggests [ o / si ]  @xmath328dex if we assume a quasar+galaxy radiation field .",
    "this large o / si ratio suggests the gas is photoionized by a softer ionizing spectrum , which would require an intense , local starburst .",
    "we note again , however , that we can not identify any such source in our images of this field @xcite . in future papers",
    ", we will explore further the validity of the o@xmath11/h@xmath11  ratio as a metallicity estimator .    before concluding , we place the metallicities of the llss toward  within the context of the cosmic metal budget of the @xmath329 universe .",

    "these central values are in good agreement with the mean metallicity of dlas at @xmath329 @xcite , i.e.  the neutral , atomic ism gas of high @xmath5 galaxies .",
    "the total @xmath6 of our systems , meanwhile , is comparable to the median @xmath3  value of the dlas @xcite .",
    "this implies that each of the lls contributes as many metals as a typical dla system .",
    "the key difference , of course , is that the llss are roughly @xmath330 more common than dlas ( paper  i ) .",
    "if the llss studied here are characteristic of the full lls population ( a wild speculation ) , the llss would contain @xmath331 the mass in metals as the dlas . in this case",
    ", the llss would represent the dominant reservoir of metals in the universe . taking this speculation to the limit",
    ", we conclude that the majority of metals in our universe lie at the galaxy / igm interface .",
    "this is analogous to the notion that the metals in galaxy clusters resides primarily in the intracluster medium .",
    "in this manuscript , we have analyzed the @xmath3  value , ionization state , and chemical abundances of the subsystems comprising a lyman limit system ( lls ) at @xmath0 toward ( table  [ tab : llssumm ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath3  value of an absorber whose ly@xmath8 , ly@xmath115 , and ly@xmath116  lines lie on the flat portion of the curve - of - growth can be constrained to within a few tenths dex provided analysis of the lyman limit and the full lyman series when resolved by echelle observations . as important",
    ", one can resolve the lls into subsystems with distinct kinematics and perform photoionization and abundance analyses for gas on ( presumable ) scales of several to tens kpc .",
    "the subsystems exhibit a presumed significant metallicity variation ( @xmath332dex ) indicating incomplete mixing of metals in the gas comprising a galactic - scale structure .",
    "finally , the following appendix provides measurements of the physical properties for the sllss at @xmath48 along the quasar sightline .",

    "the results presented in the paper on the lls at @xmath0 were derived using a simplistic , single - phase photoionization model .",
    "this model assumes all of the gas is co - spatial , has constant density , has similar temperature , and experiences the same radiation field .",
    "the data , however , offer some indications for a more complex , multi - phase medium .",
    "first , the profile fits presented reveal systematically larger @xmath72-values for the high - ion gas than the low - ion gas .",
    "this difference may indicate that some of the high - ion gas occurs in a separate phase from the low - ion gas , even though they have the same central velocity .",
    "we caution , however , that we can construct a model where the high - ion gas which coincides in velocity with the low - ion gas has identical @xmath72-value .",
    "the other observation that suggests a multi - phase medium is the positive detection of absorption in subsystem  b and the correspondingly large observed o@xmath11/si@xmath12 ratio .",

    "correspond to the single - phase scenario described earlier in the text ( @xmath85  [ sec : photo ] ) .",
    "for the scenarios where the cool phase contributes less than @xmath333 of the observed , the density of the cool phase must exceed @xmath334 giving clump sizes less than 10pc . for subsystem  c",
    ", we would predict anomalously low o / c ratios .",
    "[ fig:2phase],height=652 ]    with these motivations in mind , we performed the following calculation for subsystems  b and c. we adopted a two - phase model ( cool and warm ) where the cool phase is presumed to be a photoionized gas that gives rise to all of the observed low - ions but only a fraction  of the high - ion gas .",
    "the warm phase contributes the remainder of the high - ions observed and is otherwise ignored in this analysis . in figure",
    "[ fig:2phase ] , we summarize the implications of this two - phase model as a function of . the results at @xmath335 correspond , by definition , to the single - phase models considered in @xmath85  [ sec : photo ] .",
    "the solid curves in figure  [ fig:2phase ] show the chemical abundances of o , c , and si in the cool phase .",
    "we note a strong dependence of o / h on  which emphasizes the fact that the observed o@xmath11/h@xmath11 ratio is not a robust measure of o / h in highly ionized systems .",
    "in contrast , the si / h and c / h abundances ( which are derived from the si@xmath12/h@xmath11 and c@xmath12/h@xmath11 ratios ) have only mild dependence on . at the lowest  values considered , which correspond to @xmath336 in the cool phase , we observe for subsystem  b that the o , si , and c abundances have roughly solar relative and absolute abundances .",
    "the comparison can not be well made for subsystem  c as the o abundances are strictly upper limits due to the non - detection of  1302 .",
    "we do note , however , that very low values for  imply super - solar c / o ratios .",
    "the gray dotted , dashed , and dot - dashed curves in figure  [ fig:2phase ] show the physical conditions of the cool phase .",
    "we find that the neutral fraction @xmath337 of the gas remains low ( @xmath338 ) for the range of  values considered .",
    "the densities plotted correspond to a lower limit on the gas density where we have converted the ionization potential of the gas into a density by adopting the mean intensity of the euvb at @xmath0 ( our input spectrum from cuba has @xmath339 ) .",
    "if there is an additional , local radiation field then the densities will be higher than those plotted . at the lowest  values we find @xmath340 which would be a surprisingly high value for lls systems although we have little to compare against .",
    "more importantly , the inferred sizes @xmath341 ( plotted in units of 100pc ) for @xmath342 are of the order of 10pc or smaller . in contrast",
    ", the single - phase solutions imply sizes of the order 1 to 10 kpc for the two subsystems .",
    "if we were to adopt a two - phase scenario for subsystems  b and c where the majority of high - ions arise in the warm phase , then we are driven to a rather dense medium with very small physical size .",

    "our conclusions on the ionization state ( highly ionized ) and the large difference in metal abundances between subsystems  b and c remain unchanged .",
