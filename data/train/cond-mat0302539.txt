    "gdco@xmath6 occupies a special place in rco@xmath6 family since gd 4f magnetic moment has no orbital contribution and , therefore crystal - field effects are not important for this compound .",

    "mr of these alloys is positive below curie temperature and is very large .",

    "the known mechanisms of a positive mr can not explain the experimental data . a rough estimate of lorenz force - driven mr one can get from a comparison with the mr of pure yco@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite in the most pure samples of yco@xmath6 ( with residual resistivity of about 2  @xmath32 cm ) the lorenz force - driven positive contribution to the total mr does not exceed 5% . on the other hand the resistivity of the fm alloys at low temperatures falls into the region from 30 to 100  @xmath32 cm , i.e. at least one order of magnitude larger than the resistivity of pure yco@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , according to koehler s rule , this mechanism can give mr of only about 0.5% , this has to be compared with the experimental mr of almost 40% .",
    "weak localization effect is known to give positive mr .",
    "however our estimates show that this mechanism can give a contribution which is at least two order of magnitude smaller than the observed mr .",
    "the key for understanding the mechanism of the positive mr is a combination of strong dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath33 of metamagnetic co-3d subsystem on the effective magnetic field and of the structural disorder in the r - sublattice of the alloys . in case of gdco@xmath6 as well as in the case of other magnetic rco@xmath6 compounds with heavy r - elements ,",
    "the 4f3d exchange interaction is described by introducing an effective field which acts on 3d electrons as : @xmath34 where b is external field , m@xmath35 is the uniform magnetization of r - sublattice , and @xmath36 - is the f  d coupling constant ( in case of gdco@xmath6 @xmath37  t / f.u.@xmath38@xcite ) . in y@xmath0gd@xmath1co@xmath2 alloys",
    "the gd moments are randomly distributed over the r - sites of the crystal lattice .",
    "therefore , the effective field acting on 3d electrons depends on the local distribution of gd moments and is therefore a random function of coordinate .",
    "this random field can be characterized by a distribution function @xmath39 .",
    "the spatially fluctuating effective field induces an inhomogeneous magnetization of co-3d electron system : @xmath40 therefore even at zero temperature in the ferromagnetic ground state , there are two kind of static magnetic fluctuations in the system : i. @xmath41 ; ii .",
    "@xmath42 . these fluctuations give an additional contribution to the resistivity .",
    "since at t=0  k in ferromagnetic phase the 4f magnetic moments are saturated the corresponding contribution to the resistivity does not depend on external magnetic field . on the other hand , the 3d magnetic moment , as we will see later ,",
    "is not saturated even in the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "therefore the 3d magnetization does depend on the external field .",
    "however , as long as 3d susceptibility is field independent and uniform , the external magnetic field will change only the mean ( non - fluctuating part ) value of the magnetization , whereas the magnitude of the fluctuations of @xmath43 and corresponding contribution to the resistivity remain unchanged .",
    "however actually , the 3d system is close to the metamagnetic instability .",
    "therefore the 3d susceptibility @xmath44 is field dependent and gives rise to static magnetic fluctuations which are dependent on magnetic field resulting in non - zero magnetoresistivity .    for a qualitative analysis of this new mechanism of mr",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "+ 1.we consider the system only in its ground state .",
    "+ 2.correlations between potential and spin - dependent scattering are neglected .",
    "+ 3.only the contributions which may be strongly dependent on external magnetic field are retained , e.g. we do not include the effects related to a change of d - density of states in magnetic field , and contributions due to potential scattering and scattering on 4f moments .",
    "in fact only the contribution related to the scattering on fluctuations of co-3d magnetization will be considered .",
    "+ figure  [ co - magnet ] shows schematically the dependency of the co-3d magnetization of rco@xmath2 compounds on effective magnetic field @xcite and the distribution function @xmath45 .",
    "the metamagnetic transition is indicated by the rapid increase of the magnetization around 70  t.     compounds vs effective magnetic field ( left axis ) @xcite ( shown schematically ) .",
    "the dotted line is a schematic representation of the distribution function @xmath46 ( right axis ) , the shaded area indicates the position of @xmath47 in external field of 15  t. ]    for the further discussion it is important to have an estimate of the magnitude of the fluctuations of the effective field , i.e. the width of the distribution function @xmath39 .",
    "we can get a hint considering experimental data on field ( 0 to 7  t ) dependency of the magnetization , fig.[magnz ] .",
    "gd@xmath1co@xmath2 alloys vs magnetic field . ]",
    "two important points follow from these data : i. there is a non - saturating para - process in these field dependencies above about 2 t ; ii . the estimated susceptibility of this para - process ( @xmath48 0.016  @xmath49/t ) is larger than the susceptibility of 3d system below and above metamagnetic transition ( @xmath50 0.002  @xmath49/t ) , however it is smaller than the susceptibility in the transition region ( @xmath48 0.04  @xmath49/t).@xcite this indicates , that the scale of the fluctuations is larger than the width of the metamagnetic transition . therefore we can not treat the fluctuating part of the effective field as a perturbation and have to resort to a phenomenological analysis .",

    "[ pasdiag ] .",
    "secondly , there can be additional contributions , both positive and negative , near to zero - temperature magnetic phase boundary due to closeness to qcp .",
    "an independent test of the model is based on the observation that the critical magnetic field @xmath65 of the metamagnetic transition in 3d subsystem increases under external hydrostatic pressure ( p ) .",
    "@xcite therefore , basing on the model , we expect that the resistivity of the alloys with the composition left of the resistivity maximum ( see fig .",

    "large positive mr , found in the fm y@xmath0gd@xmath125co@xmath6 alloys and strong pressure dependence of the resistivity are explained as arising from a combination of static magnetic disorder and strong magnetic field dependence of magnetic susceptibility .",
