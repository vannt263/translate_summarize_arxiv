    "there is a strong theoretical expectation that the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in nature is more intricate than the single higgs boson predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one reason is that the large hierarchy between the planck and electroweak scales is unstable in the sm .",
    "the stabilization of this separation generically predicts the existence of new heavy partners of the top quark that cancel the quadratically divergent contribution of the sm top quark to the higgs mass , thereby allowing the electroweak scale to be naturally small .",
    "another reason is that the relic abundance of the dark matter in the universe is naturally explained by a stable , neutral particle with a mass near the electroweak scale .",
    "many extensions of the sm attempt to simultaneously solve both of these issues , and contain both a heavy new particle with the gauge quantum numbers of the sm top quark , and a new discrete symmetry which makes the lightest parity - odd particle a good dark matter candidate .",
    "examples of such models are the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite and the littlest higgs with t - parity  @xcite .",
    "the mssm contains a spin-0 stop quark and a spin-1/2 neutralino that fulfill the aforementioned roles , while the littlest higgs with t - parity contains a new spin-1/2 fermion and a parity - odd partner of the photon , which respectively serve as the top - quark partner and the dark matter candidate .",
    "although no hint of such states has yet been observed at the lhc , they remain the subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "a generic prediction of such theories is the qcd - initiated pair production of two top partners , followed subsequently by their decay into the sm top quarks plus the dark matter candidate .",
    "this leads to the signature @xmath2 where @xmath3 generically denotes the top - quark partner and @xmath4 the dark - matter candidate .",
    "the @xmath5 pair then decays either semi - leptonically , or into a dilepton final state ( we will not consider the fully - hadronic final state in this paper ) .",

    "the current limits exclude @xmath3 masses up to 600 gev , depending on both the spin of the top partner and the mass of the dark matter particle . the proposed theoretical search strategies , and those utilized experimentally , all require an excess in the tail of an energy - related distribution , such as @xmath6 , the transverse mass of the lepton and missing @xmath7 if the top - quark pair decays semi - leptonically ( denoted by @xmath8 in this manuscript ) , or the effective transverse mass @xmath9 , where @xmath10 runs over all observable particles and @xmath11 . it has been emphasized that variables such as @xmath12 may also help distinguish the spin and other properties of the top partner  @xcite .",

    "the virtual corrections to the top - partner decay processes were also cross - checked by a second independent calculation .",
    "the implementation of the real corrections was checked for independence on the cut - off parameter @xmath43 that controls the resolved phase space of the dipole subtraction terms . to further check the implementation of the decay stages , we tested factorization properties between production and decay matrix elements .",

    "the stop production cross section depends on three additional parameters besides the stop mass : the gluino mass , the stop mixing angle , and the light - flavor squark masses .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on these additional parameters was found to be at most 2% in several example susy models in ref .",
    "we also confirm using prospino that this production channel receives negligible gluino contributions from heavy virtual gluinos once its mass exceeds one tev .",
    "this choice is well motivated since lighter gluinos are already experimentally excluded for a wide variety of models .",
    "the decay of a stop quark depends on additional electroweak parameters as well as the stop mixing angle and the mixing matrix of the neutral gauge eigenstates .",
    "however , if we assume a 100 percent branching fraction of the stop quark into a neutralino and a top quark , only the relative strength of left- and right - handed coupling remains .",
    "in this section we present and discuss in detail our numerical results .",
    "we show predictions for top - partner production using four different types of simulation : leading order in qcd ; next - to - leading order in qcd ; a leading - order top - partner production sample with parton - showering included ; a sample of top - partner production with one additional hard jet merged with a parton shower by the mlm procedure . for the latter two we use madgraph  @xcite to generate the tree - level matrix elements and pythia  @xcite to perform the showering .",
    "we use pythia version 6.426 as provided in the default madgraph distribution .",
    "all the shown uncertainties are obtained by varying the renormalization and factorization scales by a factor of two around the top partner mass . while the production of the top partners is completely determined by qcd gauge invariance ,",
    "the top - partner decay depends on the top - partner coupling to @xmath4 .",
    "our choice of the left- and right - handed couplings for the scalar top partner to the top and @xmath4 follows the atlas parameters choice whereas for the fermionic top - partner our choice is as follows : @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev .",
    "we note that this choice does not have a strong theoretical motivation .",
    "it is meant to illustrate the impact of higher - order effects , and to make connection to our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we begin by presenting results for scalar top - partner production at an 8 tev lhc , assuming the parameter values @xmath16 gev and @xmath17 gev .",
    "these choices are near the current exclusion limits set by atlas  @xcite .",
    "we note that the variables used to discriminate signal from background in this analysis where the missing transverse momentum @xmath50 and the transverse mass @xmath51 , defined as @xmath52 we therefore focus on them in our study .",

    "we have observed no difference in the @xmath51 shape when comparing the fixed - order results with those from the matrix - element plus parton shower simulation .",
    "we also show in this plot the effect of calculating the @xmath3 decay to only leading order , and find that the shape changes by up to 10% due to qcd corrections in the decay .",
    "the situation is different for the @xmath50 distribution .",
    "the @xmath55-factor grows large with increasing @xmath50 , increasing from 1.2 at @xmath56 gev to over 2 at @xmath57 gev .",

    "the lo scale dependence vanishes , and is not a good estimate of the higher - order corrections .",

    "we note that the tuned herwig simulation used in the current atlas searches for stop - quark pair production correctly produces the next - to - leading order distribution shapes , indicating that the acceptances used in this experimental analysis are correct .",
    "another conclusion we draw from our results is that the scale variation of the inclusive cross section does not accurately reflect the uncertainty in the theoretical cross section after cuts are imposed . in our study",
    "this was most striking when we considered a compressed spectrum at the 8 tev lhc ; the scale uncertainty after cuts was almost a factor of two larger than the variation of the inclusive cross section .",
    "the scale variation of the cross section after cuts should be used as the theoretical systematic error when setting exclusion limits , and we encourage the experimental collaborations to quantify the effect by revising their error estimate .",
    "finally , we compared several distributions that could potentially provide a handle on determining the spin of the top - quark partner in the dileptonic mode , including @xmath58 and @xmath61 .",

    "<S> we perform a detailed study of top - quark partner production in the @xmath0 plus large missing energy final - state at the lhc , presenting results for both scalar and fermionic top - quark partners in the semi - leptonic and dileptonic decay modes of the top quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of several simulation tools : leading - order matrix elements , next - to - leading order matrix elements , leading - order plus parton shower simulations , and merged samples that contain the signal process with an additional hard jet radiated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that predictions from leading - order plus parton shower simulations can significantly deviate from nlo qcd or lo merged samples and do not correctly model the kinematics of the @xmath1 signature . </S>",
    "<S> they are therefore not a good framework for modeling this new physics signature . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the acceptances obtained with a merged sample of the leading - order process together with the radiation of an additional hard jet are in agreement with the nlo predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the scale variation of the inclusive cross section , plus that of the acceptance , does not accurately reflect the uncertainty of the cross section after cuts , which is typically larger . </S>",
    "<S> we show the importance of including higher - order qcd corrections when using kinematic distributions to determine the spin of the top - quark partner . </S>"
