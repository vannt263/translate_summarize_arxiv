    "the scenario before the discovery , in early 20th century ( in 1929 ) , of hubble s expansion was almost stagnant & static in astrophysics & cosmology .",
    "though revolutionary changes occurred when ptolemy geo - centric model was replaced by copernicus helio - centric model , and advancement made then - after with the work of many scientists ( such as galileo , kepler , newton & einstein ) too are notable ; but as a whole the research situation was progressing slowly , it was almost stagnant .",
    "even the universe was considered , for sure , to be static .",
    "einstein theory , through friedman s equation , was predicting the expanding ( or contracting ) universe ; but einstein himself , being over - confident as per the then prevailing belief that the universe is static , introduced a fuzz - factor ( cosmological constant @xmath4 ) into his equation to make the universe static .",
    "einstein , later , after hearing the hubble s expansion , regretted the introduction of @xmath4 and said it to be his ` greatest blunder ' of life @xcite .",
    "though einstein abandoned @xmath4 but some other scientist kept it alive , however , for one reason or the other .",
    "the expansion implies that in the past the universe was smaller .",
    "if we rewind the conceptual - film of expansion , we reach to a point ( singularity ) wherein the so - called big - bang occurred .",
    "if we run the film forward from the big - bang , after about @xmath5 lac years we pass through an era of de - coupling ( of matter & radiation ) , the relic of which is known as cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) radiation and it is considered as the firm evidence of big - bang theory [ 1 - 3 ] . soon after the big - bang , within extremely - short - time there was a super - rapid exponential - expansion , called inflation [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "hubble s expansion is quite different , however .",
    "much later at the end of 20th century ( in 1999 ) , with the supernovae observations , scientists came to conclusion that universe is not only expanding but accelerating too [ 4 - 9 ] .",
    "these observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) suggest that the accelerated expansion of the universe is possibly powered by a smooth energy component with negative pressure dubbed as dark energy .",
    "therefore , the cosmological constant @xmath4 re - appeared once again , as vacuum - energy as a candidate for dark - energy causing the acceleration .",
    "note that the hubble s expansion was reported in 1929 , 70 years earlier than the recognition of dark - energy in 1999 responsible for the current - ongoing acceleration of the expanding - universe .",
    "is the dark - energy also responsible for hubble s expansion , in addition to the acceleration of the universe ?",
    "moreover , what is the content and constituent(s ) of the universe and that what is that which expands in the expanding - universe ?",
    "+ it is rather unbelievable but true , that in general , we even do nt know that ` we do nt know with what ( constituents ) the universe is made of ' .",
    "it is surprising that we hardly know only @xmath1 of the universe .",
    "rest of the universe is said to be made up of @xmath2 of dark - energy and @xmath3 of dark - matter . though science ( including astrophysics & cosmology ) has progressed a lot ; but even the scientists do nt know exactly what are the dark - energy & dark - matter , albeit a few theories have been suggested in literature .",
    "dark - energy [ 4 - 9 ] is responsible for acceleration of the expanding universe ; whereas dark - matter [ 10 - 14 ] is said to be necessary as extra - mass of bizarre - properties to explain the anomalous rotational - velocity of galaxy .",
    "how much matter and energy are there in the universe ?",
    "it is now well established that universe - expansion began with a big - bang [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the ultimate fate of the universe ( fig.1 ) depends [ 1 - 3 ] on the universe s matter & energy density ( @xmath6 ) as compared to a certain value called critical - density ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if @xmath8 , the universe is said to be ` closed ' ; and its expansion will slow down ( decelerate ) and start contracting leading finally to a big - crunch ( meaning hot - death of the universe ) . if @xmath9 , the universe is said to be ` open ' ; and will expand forever even much faster ( leading the universe to cold - death ) . if @xmath10 , the universe is said to be ` flat ' ; and will continue to expand but not that - fast to lead to cold - death soon .",
    "the density - ratio ( omega ) @xmath11 , determines ( the nature & fate of the universe ) that whether the universe is closed ( @xmath12 ) , open ( @xmath13 ) or flat ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "it has been estimated that the universe would have collapsed ( to hot - death ) much sooner than the present - age of the universe if @xmath12 ; and it would have cooled down ( to cold - death ) much earlier than the present - age of the universe if @xmath13 . the present - age ( 14 billion years ) constraint of the universe , compel the scientists to believe that @xmath14 , i.e. , the universe must be flat [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "+ once agreed - upon that the universe density @xmath10 , the next question arises that ` what is the universe made of ' ?",
    "estimation of visible - type matter like galaxies , stars , planets etc",
    ". hardly leads only to about @xmath15 of @xmath7 ; and when other all such things like inter - galactic gases , black - hole , white - dwarf , neutron - stars etc .",
    "are also included , the estimate hardly reaches a mere @xmath1 of @xmath7 .",
    "what is then @xmath16 of the remaining - part ?",
    "it seems invisible and unknown , hence thought as dark constituent(s ) .",
    "scientists have , presently , estimated that the major - chunk of the universe is repulsive - gravity type dark - energy ( about @xmath2 ) causing the universe s accelerated expansion [ 4 - 9 ] , and the rest is non - baryonic invisible but gravitating dark - matter ( about @xmath3 ) causing anomalous high rotational - speed of galaxies [ 10 - 14 ] . +",
    "it is intriguing that most abundant stuff ( dark energy ) is least understood .",
    "the major candidate for the dark - energy is considered to be the cosmological constant @xmath4 ( vacuum - energy ) , though other theories have been proposed , for dark - energy having wide - range origin(s ) ranging from tiny - nucleus @xcite to mighty brane - world @xcite .",
    "initially it was thought that the universe would be decelerating due to gravity inside , but now it is well established from several clues [ 4 - 9 ] such as supernovae observations that the universe is actually accelerating due to repulsive gravity of dark - energy .",
    "the deceleration - parameter @xmath17 is defined as follows in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "( note that even though universe is actually accelerating , but the old name deceleration - parameter retained ; but @xmath17 comes out to be actually negative , implying that @xmath18 is positive i.e. , universe is accelerating ) .",
    "note that though scale - factor s ( ratio of the co - moving distance at previous - time at @xmath19 to the co - moving distance at present - time @xmath20 ) is dimensionless whereas size - of - universe ( or co - moving- distance ) has dimension of length ; but sometimes all these are denoted by the same symbol s , mainly in view that the scale - factor is proportional to the size - of - universe ( co - moving - distance ) and incidentally both the words begin with the letter s. sometimes , as in references @xcite , scale - factor and universe - size are denoted by symbol ` a ' ( but we can not use such symbol here because in this paper ` a ' is used for acceleration ) .",
    "so it is better for clarity , if all these are denoted by different symbols as follows ; scale - factor as s , co - moving distance between two points as d , universe size as @xmath21 , all being function of time due to expansion of universe .",
    "thus scale factor @xmath22 or simply @xmath23 where d is the co - moving distance in the past ( at @xmath19 ) and @xmath24 is the co - moving distance at present ( at @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence it is obvious that s is proportional to d. universe - size is @xmath21 i.e. , the distance of the visible universe - horizon , such that as per hubble s law @xmath25 .",
    "( note that even if universe - tip may be moving with speed higher than light - speed , as it was during inflation , the observable ` visible ' horizon will be limited by the equation @xmath26 ) .",
    "+   + the deceleration parameter q is conventionally defined by @xmath27 putting the experimental ( see the ref .",
    "@xcite ) value of @xmath28 , the expression for the acceleration ( @xmath29 ) of the universe ( or galaxy as the case may be ) due to dark - energy is given by , @xmath30 but in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) what should we use for s ?",
    "it seems for galaxy observations , more appropriately s should be ( being proportional ) the co - moving - distance d , say , between the observed galaxy ( say , andromeda galaxy ) from the earth ( situated in the milky - way galaxy ) .",
    "hence , the galactic acceleration due to dark energy can be obtained as follows by replacing s by d in the previous equation , @xmath31",
    "note that from hubble s law of the expansion , velocity is proportional to distance i.e. , @xmath0 , h being hubble s constant .",
    "hubble s law @xmath0 is rewritten as @xmath32 .",
    "this also gives the acceleration @xmath33 which is ( almost ) exactly of the same - form ( equivalent ) as the eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "thus , this also reinforces the understanding that the co - moving distance d is proportional to scale - factor or vice - verse .",
    "this also indicates an important possibility that the hubble s expansion is due to dark - energy .",
    "therefore , galactic acceleration due to hubble s expansion is , @xmath34",
    "the two equations , one for the galactic acceleration @xmath29 ( eq .",
    "3 ) due to dark - energy and the other for the galactic acceleration ( eq .",
    "5 ) due to hubble s law , are of ( exactly ) the same - form , possibly it could be equal too , but the accelerations differ by a little factor of 0.67 .",
    "the small factor 0.67 may be ignored , albeit it may due to some reason ( coincidence ) .",
    "it , however , seems that the hubble s expansion as well as its acceleration is due to the dark - energy .",
    "the big question is that whether hubble s expansion is just due to the shock of big - bang & inflation or it is due to the repulsive - gravity of dark - energy ?",
    "earlier it was thought that the hubble s expansion is the aftermath effect since big - bang & inflation , but now it is believed to be ( accelerating ) due to dark - energy . the similarity in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) & eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is not a mere coincidence ; it indicates that hubble s expansion is indeed due to dark - energy .",
    "the expansion occurred much earlier ; the acceleration , however , is comparatively a recent phenomenon much later ( at @xmath36 ) than the galaxy - formation era ( at @xmath37 ) , as described in reference @xcite in accordance with the astrophysical constraints @xcite .",
    "the common understanding of the universe - expansion is through re - introducing the once - discarded cosmological - constant @xmath4 ; though there are other theories / candidates @xcite for dark - energy such as scalar - field , nuclear - energy , brane - world .",
    "what is that which is expanding ? it is the fabric of universe or the scale - factor @xmath38 or the co - moving distance d or its maximum - value @xmath21 ( the universe ) expanding , as mentioned in the section-3 .",
    "there are several coincidences of appearance of a factor @xmath40 in the physics & cosmology ( which may have some reasons , a few of which are explained in reference @xcite ) .",
    "these @xmath39 coincidences are listed as follows .",
    "there seems to be some reasons for it ( as just indicated ) , or these coincidences of @xmath39 are purely by chance ( coincidence ) ?",
    "the regime of the @xmath39 coincidences appear to be too wide , ranging from tiny strings & quark to mighty universe & cosmos .    * for dark - energy ( quintessence ) the equation of state parameter @xmath41 .",
    "* dark - energy is about @xmath39 ( about @xmath42 ) of the universe - content .",
    "* deceleration parameter ( experimental @xcite ) @xmath43 i.e. , @xmath44 .    * as per the eqs .",
    "( 3 & 5 ) mentioned in this paper @xmath45 or @xmath46 .    *",
    "hubble s age @xmath47 and present age @xmath48 ( for matter universe ) are related as @xmath49 .",
    "most likely this could be to the answer for the difference of 0.67 ( = 2/3 ) in the equations ( 3 & 5 ) .    * our solar - system",
    "is situated at about @xmath39 radial - distance from the centre of the milky - way galaxy .",
    "* planetary - orbit r and its time - period t are linked with @xmath50 power kepler s law as @xmath51 .    * about @xmath50 of the earth - surface is covered by water ( sea ) .    *",
    "up - quark has a fractional charge of @xmath52 .    * in 10-dimensional super string theory ,",
    "the ratio of the usual 4-dimensional space - time to the 6 curled - up dimensions is @xmath53 .",
    "hubble s expansion is a slow expansion of universe and from galactic - observation hubble s famous formula is @xmath54 or @xmath32 .",
    "this also leads to a galactic - acceleration @xmath55 .",
    "this incidentally is of the same - form as obtained by the formula of deceleration ( acceleration ) parameter ; the acceleration caused by dark - energy is as @xmath56 .",
    "these two equation are of exactly same - form , except by a factor of 2/3 , the coincidence of this yet to be fully explained . moreover , in view of the striking - similarity in the equations ( 3 & 5 ) , it is concluded that : yes , ` it is the dark - energy responsible for hubble s expansion too , in - addition to the current on - going acceleration of the universe ' .",
