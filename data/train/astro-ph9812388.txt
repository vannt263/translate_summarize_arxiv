    "parameters prior to the launch of these surveyors . in this respect , the supernovae search ( see the supernova cosmological project , perlmutter _",
    "et al . _ 1998 ) or gravitational lensing surveys ( for a review see mellier 1998 ) offer the best perspectives . in particular ,",
    "if they are used jointly , a reasonable precision can be reached , provided that the degeneracy regarding to the determination of parameters @xmath16 of each method are orthogonal .",
    "this is for instance the case for the supernovae experiments and the weak lensing analysis as presented hereinafter or as produced by large scale structures ( van waerbeke et al 1998 ) .",
    "+ the limitations of any of these methods ( even planck measurements ) are the understanding of the systematic bias and eventually the control of the large number of free parameters attached to each of them . due to the difficulties to handle these issues",
    "it is important to diversify the methods to measure @xmath17 and to find out some new observational tests . in this regard , any new method that controls properly its own systematics and that decreases the number of sensitive parameters needs careful attention .",
    "+ it is well known that gravitational lensing can provide purely geometrical tests of the curvature of the universe .",
    "applications of this property to lensing clusters have been proposed by breimer & sanders ( 1992 ) and link & pierce ( 1998 ) .",
    "they suggest to use giant arcs having different redshifts to probe directly the curvature of the universe .",
    "evidently this method can provide the cosmological parameters in the simplest way , provided that the modeling of the lens is perfectly constrained . besides , it requires the spectroscopic redshifts of at least two different arcs in the same clusters , which is not an easy task . as such ,",
    "this is a method which applies to very few clusters .",
    "+ fort , mellier & dantel - fort ( 1996 ) focused on a statistical approach which explores the magnification bias coupled with the redshift distribution of the sources .",
    "fort et al .",
    "use the shape and the extension of the depletion curves produced by the magnification of the galaxies to constrain the cosmological parameters and the redshift of the sources simultaneously .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracy can be somewhat broken if the redshift of a giant arc is known and if the number density of high - redshift background galaxies is significant .",
    "however , in practice , reliable results need the investigation of a significant number of lensing arc - clusters in order to improve the statistics , to minimize the systematics ( like multiple lens planes ) and to explore the sensitivity to the lens modeling",
    ". + the key issue on the fort et al .",
    "approach is the coupling between the cosmological parameters , the redshift of the sources and the lens modeling .",
    "an attempt to disentangle these three quantities has been proposed by lombardi & bertin ( 1998 ) , using a method which applies in rich clusters of galaxies , inside the region where the weak - lensing regime is valid .",
    "they use the knowledge of the photometric redshifts for a joint iterative reconstruction of the mass of the cluster and the cosmology .",
    "however their iteration method assumes that the mass of the deflecting cluster is known ( or equivalently they assume that the mass - sheet degeneracy inherent to the mass reconstruction is broken ) .",
    "this assumption is the key of the problem , because it means that a perfect correction of the systematic bias on the @xmath16 determination due to the systematic errors in the mass reconstruction ( see section 3.1 ) can be achieved , which is still not presently the case ( see mellier 1998 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "indeed , for such a curvature test one should try to escape to the uncertainties of the potential modeling ( mass reconstruction)of the cluster .",
    "+ the triplet method proposed in this paper can solve this problem because it is based on the construction of an ( @xmath0,@xmath1)-estimator independent of the lens potential . basically , it consists in comparing the elliptical shear of 3 nearby galaxies of different color redshifts probing the same part of the potential across the cluster .",
    "when the galaxies are close enough , their observed ellipticity only depends on three unknown parameters , the local convergence and shear ( related to the second order derivatives of the projected potential of the cluster ) and namely the cosmological parameter ( @xmath18 ) , through the angular distance ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the use of a triplet of nearby galaxies enables to break this degeneracy and provides a local geometrical operator only dependent on ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we chose a local linear operator regarding to the observed ellipticities , and we average it on all set of close - triplets detected in many lens planes . follows a global geometrical estimator , biased by a noise ( coming mainly from the intrinsic source ellipticities ) which decreases as the inverse of the square root of the number of triplets .",
    "it means that with a large number of lensing clusters one can estimate ( @xmath18 ) with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "this technique and its efficiency are discussed in the following sections .",
    "+ section 2 reminds rapidly the lensing equations and the basic lensing quantities relevant for the paper .",
    "section 3 shows how to build the geometrical estimator @xmath4 which uses triplets of distorted galaxies .",
    "the principle and the detailed analysis of our method are also discussed . the signal to noise ratio of the method",
    "is then derived as well as the probability distribution of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) .",
    "although the main objective of this first paper is mostly to present the principle of the method , section 4 gives an evaluation of the amplitude of several systematic biases coming from possible perturbing lenses distributed along the line of sight of triplets ( galaxies or larger structures ) .",
    "preliminary solutions to these systematic biases and ideas of optimizing the method ( selection in the geometry of clusters and choice of redshifts ) are developed in section 5 .",
    "the method is tested on simulations in section 6 .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and suggest some observational strategies in section 7 . +",
    "the lensing properties are determined by the dimensionless convergence ( the strength of the lens ) @xmath19 and shear ( the distortion induced by the lens ) , index behind a complex number indicates its conjugated element . ] which both depend on the second order derivatives of the two - dimensional projected deflecting potential .",
    "the lensing effect of a cluster on background galaxies can be expressed as an amplification matrix defined in each angular position around the cluster as ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath19 is a dimensionless form of the cluster surface mass density @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the source , from the observer to the lens and from the lens to the source respectively . for the weak lensing regime",
    "the gravitational distortion produced by a lensing cluster can be modeled by a transformation in the ellipticity of the galaxies from the source plan ( @xmath27 ) to the image plane ( @xmath28 ) ( see appendix a ) : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the complex observed ellipticity , @xmath31 is the complex reduced shear and @xmath32 is what we will call the complex corrected source ellipticity . either in the source or the image plan , the ellipticity parameter is defined by : @xmath33 @xmath34 is the axis ratio of the image isophotes and @xmath35 is the orientation of the main axis . +",
    "the convergence and the shear both depend on the source redshift through an absolute lensing factor @xmath36 appearing in equation ( 3 ) : @xmath37    adopting the notation of seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) who relate the lensing parameters to the value they would have at infinite redshift , @xmath19 and @xmath38 now write : @xmath39    hereafter , @xmath40 will be named the lensing factor .",
    "this is the term which contains the cosmological dependency .",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 with @xmath0 in the case @xmath8 ( flat geometry ) and in the case @xmath10 , is given on figure ( 1 ) .",
    "all curves range from @xmath41 ( for a source redshift equal to the cluster redshift ) to @xmath42 ( for an infinite source redshift ) .",
    "their main difference is a small change in their convexity . that is why the use of numerous triplets of sources at different redshifts may disentangle these curves , i.e. provide a constraint on the cosmological parameters .",
    "+    the core of the method is to proceed in such a way that this constraint is independent on the potential of the cluster .",
    "we have constructed an operator which depends theoretically on ( @xmath43 ) and can be computed simply from the observed ellipticities of background galaxies as well as their photometric redshift .",
    "its main property is to be equal to zero when the cosmological parameters are equal to the actual ones .",
    "we proceed in two steps : first , we build such an operator ( @xmath44 ) from triplets of close sources , and second we average it on many triplets of sources to obtain the final geometrical operator @xmath4 .      for a background galaxy at redshift @xmath45 , equation ( 4 )",
    "rewrites @xmath46 where the lower index ( @xmath47 ) refers to the redshift @xmath45 and the upper index ( @xmath48 ) refers to the actual values of the cosmological parameters : @xmath49,@xmath50 . the second term in equation ( 10 ) , @xmath51 represents the part of the image ellipticity that depends on the cosmology .",
    "+ let us now consider a triplet of background neighboring galaxies in the image plane and lying at redshifts @xmath45 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the number density of triplets depends on the deepness of the observations .",
    "for instance , up to @xmath54 mag . , we expect a mean density of @xmath55 sources arcmin@xmath56 , that is about 4 sources inside a circle of radius @xmath57 arcseconds . in the following ,",
    "we thus consider that each galaxy of the triplet is distorted by the same local potential i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the same for the three galaxies .",
    "the bias induced by this approximation will be discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "the triplet of galaxies gives a triplet of equations ( 11 ) respectively indexed by @xmath47 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 from which we can derive a final equation independent both on @xmath58 and @xmath62 .",
    "this equation writes simply as the zero of a 3 - 3 determinant : @xmath63 the first term of this equation can now be formally generalized to a complex operator @xmath44 of @xmath16 built from the complex measured ellipticities of the three galaxies : @xmath64 the dependency in @xmath16 is contained in each term @xmath65 ( @xmath66 , @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) defined by equation ( 9 ) for @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath44 is more explicitly the sum of two @xmath16 functions : @xmath68 which is equal to zero for the actual values of the cosmological parameters , and a complex noise @xmath6 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 at this point it is important to stress that the @xmath58 contribution can not be neglected ( see equation ( 11 ) ) . indeed ,",
    "if we consider for instance a @xmath71 variation of the cosmological parameters ( along the gradient of @xmath72 ) , the resulting relative variation of the term @xmath73 is about @xmath74 which is about ten times smaller than the relative variation due to the @xmath75 term , in equation ( 11 ) .",
    "that is why both contributions from the local convergence ( @xmath58 ) and the local shear ( @xmath76 ) of the cluster potential must be taken in account .",
    "+ lombardi & bertin ( 1998 ) proposed to reconstruct jointly the shear , the convergence and @xmath16 in the weak lensing area , with an iteration method based on the equation ( 11 ) .",
    "their method seems to converge relatively rapidly with a small number of clusters but it seems that for their simulations they implicitly assume that the mass of the cluster is known .",
    "however , one can see that equation ( 11 ) is invariant when replacing @xmath76 by @xmath77 and @xmath78 by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is a constant ) .",
    "this expresses the mass - sheet degeneracy problem which implies that the total mass of the lensing cluster is uncertain . indeed , despite",
    "the numerous suggestions which have been proposed in order to solve this issue ( seitz & schneider , 1997 ) , for the moment mass reconstruction techniques can not disregard systematic errors analysis ( see mellier 1998 for a comprehensive review ) . as an example",
    ", a @xmath81 systematic bias on the determination of the total mass of the cluster ( or equivalently a @xmath81 systematic on the mean value of @xmath58 ) is equivalent to a systematic bias larger than 0.2 on the value of the cosmological parameters ( when compared to the @xmath74 contribution from the lensing factor mentioned above ) .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the lens potential is a critical strong assumption .",
    "+ in the triplet method it is possible to constrain the cosmological parameters regardless the potential of the lens .",
    "no assumption is made in order to relate the values of the local shear and the local convergence .",
    "hence they are considered as independent parameters . in order to construct a @xmath4 operator which only depends on @xmath16 , we then need three local equations relating @xmath58 , @xmath76 and @xmath16 to cancel the potential dependency .",
    "this is achieved with the measured ellipticity equations ( 10 ) applied to triplets of close galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "besides , the form of the @xmath4 operator becomes unique and must have the formal expression given in equation ( 13 ) if we want it linear with respect to the ellipticities provided by the observations . to sum up",
    ", the use of triplets of galaxies through the operator @xmath4 is the simplest way to build a pure geometrical operator which drops both the @xmath58 and @xmath76 dependencies and keeps linear regarding to the ellipticities .",
    "+ the statistical noise @xmath6 will be more explicitly calculated in section 3.4 . for the moment",
    "it is just important to understand that the probability distribution of this noise ( real and imaginary parts ) regarding the different triplets of galaxies is a random law centered on 0 since the linear construction of @xmath4 makes the different sources of noise ( mainly the intrinsic source ellipticity ) be randomly distributed around 0 . + the above formula does not take in account the systematics ( an effect of galaxy - galaxy lensing , a presence of background structures ) that will be studied further in section 4 .      before averaging @xmath82 on many triplets ( that is to say on all the triplets done with galaxies contained within a given radius ) ,",
    "let us stress that it makes sense .",
    "indeed , by averaging ( we only consider the real part of the complex noise ) on many triplets the noise contribution decreases as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the number of background galaxies ( and not the number of triplets , since many triplets are redundant ) . while the noise is vanishing , the method can provide valuable constraints as far as cosmological operator @xmath68 does not vanish too , or in other words if its behavior with @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the same ( not random ) whatever the triplet is . fortunately this is the case provided that the three redshifts of all the triplets are ordered similarly : for example @xmath83 .",
    "+ consequently we can derive @xmath4 from an average of @xmath44 on all the ordered triplets @xmath84 : @xmath85 according to equation ( 14 ) , @xmath4 is also composed of two terms : the first one @xmath86 which has the same properties as @xmath68 , and a gaussian noise @xmath87 which decreases as @xmath5 , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the real part of the complex quantities .",
    "@xmath92 is the square of @xmath76 averaged on the weak lensing area .",
    "we consider the real part of @xmath4 ( @xmath93 ) because as @xmath6 , the noise @xmath87 is complex .",
    "+ by construction @xmath86 is equal to zero at the position ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "we thus can write the following equation ( biased by the presence of the gaussian noise ) which sums up the method : ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) is a solution of @xmath94 in order to see if the triplet method can be effective from the observational point of view two questions have to be addressed :    1 .",
    "how is the @xmath4-operator degenerated in @xmath16 ?",
    "2 .   how many clusters are necessary to cancel the noise contribution with respect to the cosmological information contained in @xmath86 ?",
    "figure ( 2 ) gives the contours of @xmath96 in the @xmath16 plan , for the redshift distribution ( 42 ) , as taken in the simulations ( see section 6 ) . from this graph",
    "we see that the method is degenerated in @xmath16 .",
    "the degeneracy is parallel to the @xmath4-contours . to break this degeneracy",
    "one has either to make a theoretical assumption ( for example @xmath97 ) or to add another experimental degenerated constraint which contours are as orthogonal to the @xmath4-contours as possible , like for example high - redshift supernovae ( perlmutter et al . 1998 ) .",
    "considering the mean orientation of its degeneracy , the triplet method can also be seen as a direct measure of the curvature of the universe @xmath98 .",
    "+ from figure ( 2 ) we also get quantitatively the variations of @xmath4 .",
    "it shows that , for an accuracy of about @xmath99 on the cosmological parameters ( along the gradient of @xmath4 ) , we must obtain a precision of about @xmath100 on g. this rate of variation has to be compared with the noise on @xmath4 .",
    "the complex noise is produced by four sources :    1 .",
    "noise from the corrected source ellipticities @xmath101 , 2 .",
    "the errors propagation on the measured ellipticities @xmath102 ( it behaves similarly as the previous ones ) , 3 .",
    "the three sources do not have the same @xmath76 and we thus have to consider @xmath103 ( in other words , each source , though close to each other , do not exactly cross the potential at the same position ) , 4 .",
    "the photometric redshifts are not the true redshifts and lead to shifts @xmath104 on the lensing factors .    from equations ( 13 )",
    "it is clear that , due to the linearity of the 3 - 3 determinant and of the averaging on all the triplets , the final noise is linear regarding to each individual term : it is composed to first order of linear combination of terms ( like @xmath105 ) , and to second order of linear combination of crossed - terms ( like @xmath106 ) .",
    "these crossed - terms can not introduce any systematic bias on g and thus can be neglected .",
    "+ the following equations give the four different noise contributions : @xmath107 , due to the corrected source ellipticity , @xmath108 , due to the error on the ellipticity , @xmath109 due to the approximate redshift and @xmath110 due to the potential , @xmath111 the terms of index @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be easily derived from these equations by cyclic permutations of the ( @xmath112 ) triplet . + it is worth noting that even if the bias , as @xmath86 , is a function of the cosmological parameters , we can neglect this dependency . indeed , for a given shift of @xmath16 around @xmath113 the variations of @xmath86 and @xmath87 verify @xmath114 .",
    "besides , provided that @xmath6 is large enough , the probability distribution of the noise @xmath115 can be considered as a gaussian law centered on 0 ( as the sum of a large number of nearly gaussian laws ) .",
    "so far , we have shown that the variance of this noise decreases as @xmath5 because of the redundancy of triplets .",
    "this applies for @xmath116 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 but not for @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , for a galaxy @xmath47 included in two different triplets the associated term @xmath117 is different in each triplet .",
    "that is why the variance of the fourth noise @xmath110 vanishes in @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the total number of triplets : @xmath120 ( see the remark of section 3.1 ) .",
    "+ the variances of the four noises behave approximately as follows ( under the conditions that will be detailed in section 6 ) : @xmath121      let us establish the relation between the signal to noise ratio of the method and the number of background galaxies ( or the number of considered clusters ) . in the following we will take only @xmath122 galaxies per cluster ( see section 6 ) . if we define the signal as a variation of @xmath86 along its gradient and @xmath123 as the variance of the statistical noise ( see section 3.4 ) , the signal to noise ratio can thus be written as : @xmath124 notation indicates the norm of a vector .",
    "@xmath125 is the accuracy on the cosmological parameters .",
    "figure ( 3 ) plots the variation of @xmath125 as a function of the number of clusters ( with an observed number density of background galaxies equal to @xmath55 by square - arcminute ) for a @xmath126 confidence level .",
    "this plot shows that an accuracy of @xmath71 can be reached ( at a @xmath126 level ) with about 1000 clusters , or similarly an accuracy of about @xmath127 can be reached ( at a @xmath126 level ) with @xmath128 clusters .",
    "+ it shows that with a good seeing one could in principle test the existence of a cosmological constant from vlt observations with about 100 clusters .",
    "far better it should be possible to measure the curvature of the universe with a reasonable accuracy from ngst observations ( the number density of background galaxies is multiplied by 10 ) .",
    "these prospects of course require that the systematics are previously corrected .",
    "these results can be refined by the introduction of a probability distribution .",
    "thanks to the gaussian behavior of the noise we can derive from the operator @xmath3 a probability distribution @xmath129 for the cosmological parameters :    @xmath130      \\right ] ^2   \\over 2 \\sigma_{gn}^{2 }     }    \\right ) }   \\   , \\ ] ]    which has just to be normalized on the considered domain of @xmath16 , ( for example @xmath8 ) .",
    "+ the operator @xmath3 is directly derived from the observational data . on the other hand , @xmath123 is obtained from simulations applied on the data in the following way . once the function @xmath3 is obtained from the observation of ( @xmath131 , z ) , it is possible to add noise to the data by adding random ellipticities ( @xmath132 ) and @xmath133 random errors to the redshifts @xmath134 : the variance of the noise @xmath87 induced on @xmath4 is then directly @xmath123 .",
    "in this section we discuss the systematics which could potentially reduce significantly the efficiency of the method from an observational point of view .",
    "though we give estimations of their amplitude , it is worth noting that a reliable quantitative estimate of their impact on the triplet method will demand additional work ( mainly simulations and calculations taking in account the perturbation coming from large - scale structures .",
    "this effect will be studied in paper ii ) . +",
    "two main systematics have been identified :    1 .   a systematic bias on @xmath4 produced by to the non - symmetry of the term @xmath135 . it can be easily corrected ( see 4.1 ) .",
    "+ 2 .   a contamination produced by the existence of background structures which play the role of perturbing lenses .",
    "they can be the background galaxies themselves ( which induce galaxy - galaxy lensing ) and possibly any condensation of mass ( clusters or large - scale structures ) located on the line of sight of the lensing cluster . in the following sections ( section 4.2 and 4.3 ) , we focus on two extreme cases : the systematic produced by the galaxies of each triplet themselves , and those generated by large - scale structures .",
    "this study will be performed using multi - lensing models ( see kovner 1987 ) .",
    "appendix b gives the calculation of the measured ellipticities in a multi - lensing model .",
    "the method supposes that we know the photometric redshifts of background galaxies as well as the probability distribution @xmath136 of the error between the photometric redshift and the true one . even if @xmath136 is symmetric and centered on 0 , which is not necessarily the case , the probability distribution of the resulting shift on @xmath137 , @xmath138 may be non symmetric and the mean value of @xmath135 may be different from zero , introducing a systematic in equation ( 23 ) .",
    "fortunately , this effect is easy to correct .",
    "since the redshift distribution @xmath139 is known the systematic can be exactly balanced by replacing in the definition of @xmath44 @xmath137 by @xmath140 , where @xmath141      since we consider triplets of galaxies having different redshifts but which are very close together in the image plane , the most distant can potentially be distorted by the lensing effect of the others .",
    "in particular , in each triplet ( @xmath142 ) ( ordered with increasing redshifts ) the galaxy @xmath47 is a perturbation of the potential for the sources @xmath60 and @xmath61 as well as the galaxy @xmath60 for the source @xmath61 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath47 is not the only perturbing lens for the source @xmath60 , and @xmath47 and @xmath60 are not the only one for the source @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , each galaxy may be itself part of a group of galaxies which produces its own additional lensing effect .",
    "nevertheless , in order to get a rough estimate of the amplitude of this kind of systematics , we will assume to first approximation that the galaxy - galaxy lensing produced within each triplet , is the dominant contribution .",
    "+ the galaxy - galaxy lensing increases as the angular distance between the galaxy - lens and the galaxy - source decreases .",
    "it also depends on their relative redshifts : that is why it induces a systematic bias on the construction of @xmath4 . in appendix",
    "b we compute the amplitude of the corrections on the measured ellipticities once several lenses along the line of sight are taken into account . from equations ( 62 ) ,",
    "( 63 ) and ( 66 ) of appendix b , one can see that these perturbations produce two kinds of taxes :    1 .   a purely additive term , @xmath143 .",
    "it can be seen as the linear contribution from the shear , as if the shears of each lenses were simply added to each other without coupling considerations .",
    "a a multiplicative term of the form @xmath144 which modifies the main cosmological term @xmath145 .",
    "it accounts for couplings between the main and additional lenses .",
    "since the three galaxies of each triplet are randomly distributed and uncorrelated , this term induces a noise rather than a systematic bias .",
    "it decreases as @xmath146 , like the noise @xmath147 for instance . besides",
    ", the shear induced by a galaxy - lensed can be controlled ( if we cancel the triplets where the angular distance between two of the three sources is too small : typically lower then a few arcsecond for typical einstein radius of galaxies .",
    "this means an induced shear inferior to about @xmath148 ) .",
    "therefore the amplitude of this additive term can be bounded to less than @xmath99 of the effect coming from the principal statistical noise @xmath107 , and thus can be neglected .",
    "+      the effect of coupling between two lenses depends on their relative redshifts through angular distances ratio , hence this term really induces a systematic bias on @xmath4 . to calculate it we have to think about the meaning of the additional convergence , @xmath149 , used in the multi - lens screen approach of the annex b. this convergence associated to the source @xmath60 and produced by the galaxy - lens @xmath47",
    "will be noted @xmath150 ; the convergences associated to the source @xmath61 and produced by the galaxy - lenses @xmath47 and @xmath60 will be noted @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we can not directly compare their value since they depend on the redshifts @xmath153 .",
    "so , in order to model this systematic bias we associate to each of these convergences an absolute one @xmath154 independent of the redshifts @xmath45 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( obviously @xmath154 should depend on the angular distance between the galaxy - source and the galaxy lens .",
    "we consider here a mean value averaged over the area around each galaxy - lens where we search for a source .",
    "for the definition of this area , see section 5.2 ) : @xmath155 the @xmath156 shift ( along the gradient of @xmath4 ) on the cosmological parameters determination and due to the galaxy - galaxy lensing perturbation effects is then : @xmath157 where the brackets @xmath158 denote the average over all the ordered triplets .",
    "+ using the redshift distribution ( 42 ) and considering the mean value of the convergence created by a galaxy as about @xmath148 ( see section 5.2 ) , one gets : @xmath159 .",
    "+ this is only an indicative value",
    ". however , with galaxy / galaxy lensing measurements , we are in principle able to account for the effect of the potential of each background galaxy .",
    "this systematic can be calculated and corrected .",
    "therefore , if the knowledge of the mean potential of galaxies can be reached with about a @xmath160 accuracy ( we could use faber - jackson models or wait for the incoming results of galaxy - galaxy lensing studies ( see schneider et al . 1996 ) ) , the remaining systematic would then be about @xmath161 . + this correction does not take in account the possibility that a fraction of the galaxies are embedded in groups which could enhance the contamination .",
    "there are two possibilities to solve this issue . since we know the photometric redshifts of the galaxies we can discriminate compact groups of galaxies and remove the corresponding triplets from the sample . or , if the galaxy - galaxy lensing results are able to account for these effects with a reasonable accuracy , then we can as previously calculate @xmath156 .",
    "+ in conclusion this effect is non - negligible but can be accurately estimated and corrected , thanks to the forthcoming observations of galaxy - galaxy lensing on blank fields .",
    "let us consider the perturbation due to background structures . before giving an estimate of it for the case of matter structures integrated along the line of sight ,",
    "we calculate the perturbation due to a single lens plane ( containing an over dense region like a cluster or even an under dense region ) .",
    "since this second lens may be located anywhere in redshift then it differently affects the measured ellipticities of the sources ( @xmath162 ) in each triplet , it can induce a systematic on the value of @xmath4 . once again and still using the calculations done in annex b ( see equation ( 66 ) ) , this systematic can be split in two parts due to an additive term ( corresponding to the linear contribution of the perturbative lens ) and a multiplicative term ( corresponding to the coupling between the main and the perturbative lenses ) .      like in the above section , we associate an absolute convergence and shear @xmath163 and @xmath164 to the additional convergence and shear @xmath165 and @xmath166 coming from the lensing effect of the structure on a source s ( s can be @xmath47 , @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) : @xmath167 where the superscript @xmath168 denotes the perturbative term . + we assume that the convergence and the shear are constant all over the image .",

    "has to be integrated along the line of sight .",
    "here we do not perform exactly this calculation ( which needs the introduction of cosmological scenario and the non linear evolution of perturbations ) but only give an estimation of it using the already known results from the studies of lensing by large scale structures ( see the review by mellier 1998 ) .",
    "calculations from the non linear evolutions of the power spectrum in the one minute angular scale predict a polarization of about @xmath172 . from this value",
    "we can make a rough estimate of the shift on @xmath16 ( using the same conditions as will be used in the simulations , section 6 ) : @xmath173 .",
    "+ this is only an indicative value , however this systematic can be estimated more accurately using the simulations of the non - linear evolution of perturbations .      the @xmath174 shift ( along the gradient of @xmath4 ) on the cosmological parameters determination and due to the coupling effect of a background perturbing structure ( with the main lens )",
    "is calculated as in 4.2.2 but is simpler since there is only one perturbating lens to which we associate an absolute convergence and shear ( see equation ( 66 ) ) .",
    "it leads to : @xmath175 the same discussion as above applies . for a condensation of mass located at redshift @xmath42 and with the redshift distribution ( 43 )",
    "this systematic is : @xmath176 . to generalize this systematic to large scale structures , the above value of @xmath174",
    "has to be integrated along the line of sight .",
    "we use again a polarization of about @xmath172 . here",
    "the difference is that this systematic effect behaves like a statistic noise because the @xmath163 can be either positive or negative .",
    "hence , when the triplet method is applied on many different clusters , we expect the averaged value of this systematic to behave roughly as the inverse of the square root of the number of considered clusters . as an example , for @xmath128 clusters , we expect this systematic to be about @xmath177 . + contrary to the other two systematics ( @xmath156 and @xmath169 ) , this one can not be corrected because of its random behavior",
    ". however its effect on the @xmath16 determination decreases with the number of considered clusters .      in the last two sections we discussed the non - linear evolution of background structures in a scale of about one arcminute to estimate the resulting systematics on the triplet method",
    ". it may be also important to take in account ( statistically ) the effect of background clusters .",
    "in particular , the accidental presence of another cluster lying along the line of sight of the main lensing - cluster could be a serious artefact . in the case of usual clusters of galaxies ,",
    "these biased targets can be easily removed from the sample by using photometric redshift informations . however ,",
    "if it happens that dark clusters do really exist , then their presence could be extremely difficult to detect .",
    "their impact on the statistics depend on the number density of such systems , if any .",
    "since we do not have any evidence from shear map that dark clusters exist , this is a somewhat an academic problem .",
    "however , such structures could be revealed by using a method like the aperture mass density . in principle , this technique is able to detect a dark halo , provided that their velocity dispersion is larger than @xmath178 km / s ( see schneider et al .",
    "+ a detailed quantitative estimate of these effects require simulations and also additional observations in order to constrain the fraction of lensing clusters which is contaminated by another cluster along the line of sight .",
    "this investigation is beyond the scope of this paper , but should be addressed in a forthcoming paper .",

    "@xmath156 is due to galaxy - galaxy lensing effects .",
    "@xmath169 is due to the linear effect of the distortion induced by background structures .",
    "@xmath174 comes from the coupling of these background structures with the main lens.the corrections of @xmath156 and @xmath169 require to adjust the method with a modeling of the potential of galaxies and large scale structures .",
    "such modeling compared with ray tracing simulations will be performed in paper ii .",
    "@xmath174 can not be corrected because of its random behavior . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     next section will give qualitative solutions to deal with part of these systematics and to increase the signal to noise ratio of the method .",
    "so far , the method has been presented in a structure as general as possible , with no particular choice for the geometry of clusters , neither for the redshifts nor for the distances between galaxies inside triplets .",
    "this section discusses qualitatively these degrees of freedom in order to increase the signal and decrease the bias @xmath169 in the same time .",
    "the method as explained so far can be applied to every cluster regardless its geometry .",
    "however new cluster samples , like the one obtained by the x - ray satellite xmm , will be useful to select only those with a symmetrical geometry , since any geometrical information can be used to decrease the systematic bias noticed due to the linear perturbation effect of background structures ( see section 4.3.1 ) .",
    "this bias is due to scalar products as @xmath180 appearing from the construction of @xmath44 in the determinant : @xmath181 assume that we apply the method to a circular cluster .",
    "then we can construct a sub - sample of triplets of galaxies inside a ring centered on the cluster center . each galaxy",
    "( @xmath47 , @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) of the triplet is associated with an angle , @xmath182 .",
    "hence , we can replace each measured ellipticity ( @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) by the tangential ellipticities ( @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) , the above determinant is replaced by : @xmath189 we can see that the arguments of the elements of the third column are randomly distributed .",
    "therefore the systematic bias @xmath169 vanishes as the inverse of the square root of the number of triplets and becomes negligible , whereas the main term is not modified .",
    "+ actually the signal to noise ratio of the method ( as defined in ( 29 ) ) can also be increased in the case of a circular geometry because the number of triplets becomes large enough to enable a stringent selection within them : either by the angular environment of the three sources ( see 5.2 ) , either by their redshift ( see 5.3.1 ) .",
    "this section refers to the necessity of rejecting of the sample sources for which another galaxy may play the role of a galaxy lens . the angular radius of the circle in which we can consider that a galaxy is isolated without important local perturbation of another galaxy depends on the real mass distribution of galaxy halos .",
    "therefore it is somewhat difficult to provide accurate estimate of this circle with our present - day knowledge of the distant galaxy halos . as a rough simplification we can consider each galaxy as an isothermal sphere and then choose the angular radius such that the induced shear ( and convergence ) is lower than @xmath190 .",
    "this conservative approximation applies not only in the section 4.2.1 , but also in 4.2.2 , where @xmath154 can thus be chosen small ( @xmath191 ) in order to decrease the systematic bias @xmath156 .",
    "+ of equal importance is the question of the maximum distance @xmath192 tolerable between each component of the triplet . or , in the case of a circular cluster analysis , what is the thickness of the rings ?",
    "to answer we need to balance two opposite effects : first , while @xmath192 increases , @xmath193 decreases proportionally to about @xmath194 ( if the shear of the cluster is a law in @xmath195 , as for an isothermal sphere ) , so the signal to noise ratio decreases ; second , in the same time the number of triplets increases making possible a judicious selection of the redshifts in the triplets ( see section 5.3.1 ) .",
    "after realistic simulations ( using a number density of galaxies equal to @xmath55 galaxies arcmin@xmath56 ) , the optimized value that has been selected for the first presentation of the method is @xmath196 arcseconds separation . in practice",
    ", this can be optimized accordingly to the shear map of the cluster .      in this section",
    "we suppose that the redshift distribution @xmath139 and the variance of the redshift error @xmath197 are known .",
    "we then investigate if the signal to noise ratio of the method can be improved thanks to either a choice in the redshifts of the triplets or a selection in redshift of the clusters .",
    "in all the oncoming considerations the number density of background galaxies has been taken equal to @xmath55 galaxies arcmin@xmath56 ) .      from the matrix form ( 15 )",
    ", it appears obvious that if two of the three redshifts of a triplet are very close together then the resulting value of @xmath68 is nearly zero and thus do no bring any cosmological information to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore it is necessary to set two minimum redshift differences @xmath198 and @xmath199 below which the triplets will not be rejected .",
    "on the other hand , if these minima are too high then too many triplets will be rejected , increasing the terms @xmath5 and @xmath123 . the right balance is obtained for @xmath200 and @xmath201 greater than about @xmath202 .",
    "+ this small value has been obtained from simulations .",
    "it proves that in the balance , the second effect is stronger .",
    "it means that with this density of galaxies , any stringent selection makes @xmath123 decrease rapidly",
    ". this will not be true anymore if we can select triplets within rings , for a nearly circular cluster , or if we use observations with ngst ( which will increase significantly the number density of galaxies ) .",
    "in these two cases , the balance becomes favorable to selections and so to an increase of the signal to noise ratio of the method .",
    "+ the second concern about the redshift selection is the difference between @xmath45 and the redshift of the lens , @xmath203 . once again",
    ", the optimization arises with the balance of two competing effects : if @xmath45 is too close to @xmath204 then the noise is increased by a nearly infinite value of @xmath205 ; however , in the same time the gradient of @xmath68 is greater .",
    "our simulations show that the right balance is obtained for @xmath203 greater than about @xmath202 , and the same discussion as above applies .",
    "we can also find the best balance between the last two effects when the redshift of the cluster changes .",
    "the most favorable cluster redshifts are strongly dependent on the shape of @xmath197 : the redshift of the cluster must be in the area where the errors on the redshifts are as small as possible for @xmath205 to be non dominant in the signal to noise ratio .",
    "+ besides , if the redshift of the cluster is too low then @xmath206 whatever the triplet is , the @xmath207 decreases .",
    "+ with @xmath197 approximately equal to @xmath208 for redshift inferior to 0.8 and equal to @xmath71 for other redshifts , simulations show that clusters at redshift between @xmath127 and @xmath209 are the most favorable to the method .",
    "in the simulations , we assumed that the redshift of each galaxy was known and we took a redshift distribution @xmath139 which represents both the usual peak of galaxies near @xmath210 ( described by the redshift distribution @xmath211 from brainerd et al .",
    "1996 ) as well as a more distant population of faint blue galaxies suggested by deep spectroscopic survey and that seem detectable in the selected color bin @xmath212 ( see fort et al 1996 , broadhurst 98 ) : @xmath213 @xmath214      \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath215 and @xmath216 , the @xmath211 and @xmath217 distributions give respectively an average redshift equal to 1 and 3 . with @xmath218 and @xmath219 , the fraction of high and low redshift galaxies found by fort et al is respected .",
    "it concerns a single observation of very faint galaxies in b and i color through the cluster cl0024 + 1654 .",
    "although broadhurst seems to have confirmed the result of this observation with the keck telescope , the redshift distribution may not be exactly representative of the general redshift distribution of the faint galaxy population for which we can determine good color redshift .",
    "however , it is important to remember that the triplet method actually test the convexity of the lensing factor curve @xmath40 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , the method mostly depends on the total number of galaxies above @xmath210 that we can detect and for which we can determine an accurate color redshift ( high signal to noise for b photometry is essential ) .",
    "if a deep multicolor photometry from u to k gives a broader redshift distribution with more galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath220 ) the result of the triplet method will be better since the new distribution will increase the number of possible triplets with significant information on the cosmology .",
    "+ we have also put realistic uncertainties in the photometric redshift of galaxies .",
    "we assume it is a gaussian distribution with a redshift dispersion equal to 0.03 for redshifts lower than 0.8 and as large as 0.1 for redshifts greater than 0.8 ( see brunner et al .",
    "1997 and hogg et al .",

    "+ for errors on the measured ellipticities , we chose the same distribution , with a dispersion equal to @xmath223 . + for the clusters , the redshift have been taken equal to @xmath179 , and their projected mass density has the following analytical shape : @xmath224 the cluster ellipticities were chosen randomly between @xmath41 and @xmath209 .",
    "it is unimportant to include a core radius since its influence in the weak lensing area is negligible ( furthermore , we recall that the principle of the method is to cancel any dependency on the mass map of the cluster ) .",
    "@xmath225 is taken to correspond to a sample of high velocity dispersion ( @xmath122 km / s ) .",

    "a circle of @xmath227 radius representing the arclets and strong lensing regimes was not considered .",
    "+ so , with an average of about @xmath55 galaxies arcmin@xmath56 , each vlt observation of a cluster contains about @xmath122 background galaxies .",

    "<S> + the linear form of @xmath4 regarding the measured ellipticity of each galaxy implies that the different noises on @xmath4 decrease as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total number of observed distorted galaxies . a calculation and comparison of each source of statistical noise is performed . </S>",
    "<S> + the possible systematics are analyzed with a multi - screen lensing model in order to estimate the effect of perturbative potentials on galaxy triplets . </S>",
    "<S> improvements are then proposed to minimize these systematics and to optimize the statistical signal to noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> + simulations are performed with realistic geometry and convergence for the lensing clusters and a redshift distribution for galaxies similar to what is observed . </S>",
    "<S> they lead to the encouraging result that a significant constraint on ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) can be reached : @xmath7 in the case @xmath8 or @xmath9 in the case @xmath10 ( at a 1@xmath11 confidence level ) . in particular the curvature of the universe can be directly constrained and the @xmath12 and @xmath13 universes can be separated with a 2@xmath11 confidence level . these constraints would be obtained from the observations of nearly 100 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to about 20 nights of vlt observations.the method is still better adapted to a large program on the ngst . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in complement to the supernovae method , the triplet method could in principle clear up the issue of the existence and value of the cosmological constant +    psfig </S>"
