    "@xcite for the former and lange  @xcite for the latter ) . besides the notable exceptions of cm curves with exceptional automorphisms , curves with cm have been exploited for point counting but not for their endomorphism ring structure , for lack of a constructive theory of efficiently computable endomorphisms .    in this work ,",

    "finally , we describe an elegant construction of mestre  @xcite from which we obtain a two - dimensional family of curves whose jacobians admit explicit endomorphisms , derived from covers of elliptic curves . in each case",
    "we develop explicit algorithms for efficient application of the endomorphism , suitable for use in a glv decomposition .",
    "independently , takashima  @xcite provided an efficient algorithm for endomorphisms in the latter family ( in terms of variants of brumer and hashimoto ) with real multiplication by @xmath12 .",
