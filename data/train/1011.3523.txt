    "recent observations show that massive galaxies ( @xmath511 ) have been in place since z@xmath10.7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this epoch also coincides with the moment at which early - type galaxies ( e - s0a s , etgs ) start to dominate the massive end of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) , suggesting that there must exist `` a dominant mechanism that links the shutdown of star formation and the acquisition of a spheroidal morphology in massive systems '' ( @xcite ) . according to current hierarchical models of galaxy formation ,",
    "this mechanism has been major merging .",
    "the hierarchical scenario predicts that present - day metgs have resulted from the most massive and violent merging sequences occurred in the universe .",
    "nevertheless , this also implies that they have been the latest systems to be in place into the cosmic scenario ( at @xmath6 , see @xcite ) , a prediction that conflicts directly with observations evidencing galaxy mass downsizing .",
    "therefore , metgs have turned into privileged laboratories to test hierarchical theories . however , studies on their physical properties have not provided conclusive results yet ( see references in @xcite ) , questioning or supporting the major - merger origin of metgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "if metgs derived mainly from major mergers , these galaxies should reside preferably in environments where mergers could have been relevant . nevertheless , the evolutionary processes controlling the galaxy evolution in each environment are still poorly understood . in clusters ,",
    "the s0 fraction is observed to increase with time at the expense of the spirals , but the fraction of ellipticals has remained constant since z@xmath10.8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as a sign of the poor role played by major mergers in the evolution of cluster ellipticals , because it suggests the conversion of cluster spirals into s0 s ( but not into ellipticals ) through mechanisms gentler than major mergers , contrary again to hierarchical expectations .",
    "however , the majority of present - day metgs do not reside in clusters , but in groups ( @xcite ) , an environment where mergers and tidal interactions determine galaxy evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the evolutive trend observed in groups is quite different to the one reported in clusters : old evolved groups evidence an evolution of spirals into s0 s , and of these later into ellipticals with time ( @xcite ) , suggesting a possible pre - processing of galaxies in groups before falling into clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , the role played by the environment in galaxy evolution ( and in particular , in the assembly of metgs ) is still unsettled .",
    "mixed scenarios have been proposed for the formation of metgs , in which blue galaxies quench their star formation through gas - rich mergers , migrate to the red sequence , and merge further through mixed and dry mergers to give place to the most massive etgs ( @xcite ) . depending on the gas content of the encounter , the outcome of the major merger would be a s0 or an elliptical ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a direct verification of the feasibility of this scenario accounting strictly for the wet / mixed / dry major mergers reported by observations at each redshift has not been carried out yet .",
    "we have approached this question directly through semi - analytical models , studying how the present - day metgs would have evolved backwards - in - time assuming that they derive exclusively from the major mergers strictly reported by observations ( ) . we have accounted for the different phases , timescales , and progenitor galaxies of a major merger depending on its type ( wet / mixed / dry ) , and for the number of major mergers of each type observed at each redshift . in particular , transitory phases in which gas - rich major mergers become dust - reddened star - forming galaxies ( dsfs ) have been considered .",
    "the model predictions apply to the global population of metgs ( averaged over all environments ) , as the local lfs and observational major merger fractions used in the model basically trace group and field environments .",
    "the effects of minor mergers have been neglected in the model ( see comments concerning this topic in ) .",

    "the model can reproduce the observed evolution of the galaxy lfs at z@xmath31 , simultaneously for different rest - frame bands ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and selection criteria ( based on color or morphology , see ) .",
    "figure[fig : fig1 ] shows the expected evolution of the lfs of red and blue galaxies in the @xmath8-band .",
    "the model predicts an increase of the number density of metgs by a factor of @xmath12 - 2.5 since z@xmath11 , in agreement with some studies ( compare the black line and the pentagons in panel d of red galaxies ) .",
    "moreover , if the dsfs predicted by the model are also considered as red galaxies , the model can also reproduce the apparent negligible number evolution of red galaxies reported by other authors ( compare the ple model , the model predictions including dsfs in the red sample , and the data -triangles and crosses- in the same panel ) .",
    "so , the model provides a framework in which conflicting observational results on the amount of number evolution experienced by massive red galaxies can be reconciled , just accounting for the typical contamination by dsfs that many red galaxy samples exhibit at @xmath11 .",
    "the gas - rich progenitors of these `` recently '' assembled metgs reproduce naturally the observational excess of @xmath140% of blue galaxies at 0.8@xmath21 , as compared to ple models ( see panel d of blue galaxies in the same figure ) .",
    "the model predicts a proportional rise in the number density of metgs since z@xmath11 similar for all mass bins ( this also applies to metgs with @xmath1211.7 at z@xmath130 ) .",
    "so , it is remarkable that , even predicting a noticeable buildup of the most massive etgs ( apparently in contradiction with mass downsizing ) , the lf of these systems predicted by the model at 0.8@xmath21 lies on top of the ple model ( accordingly to observational data supporting mass downsizing ) .",

    ", the model proves that mass downsizing and hierarchical scenarios can be reconciled easily .",
    "in fact , it predicts that more than @xmath190% of the metgs existing at z@xmath11 are going to be involved in a dry or mixed event since then ( see fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this means that these metgs are not the passively - evolved high - z counterparts of present - day ones ( as usually interpreted in many studies ) , but their gas - poor progenitors instead .",
