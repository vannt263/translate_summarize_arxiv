    "skewed parton distributions are needed to calculate exclusive diffractive production , such as @xmath6 for light or heavy vector mesons , see e.g. @xcite , central exclusive diffractive higgs boson production at the lhc  @xcite , etc .",
    "for all these diffractive processes we need skewed parton distributions at small values of @xmath7 , and small to medium scales .",
    "data for diffractive @xmath8 production , for example , test the gluon in the range @xmath9 and effective scales @xmath10 gev@xmath11  @xcite . for exclusive higgs production at the lhc ,",
    "the regime of @xmath12 and scales of the order 5 gev@xmath11 will be relevant , see  @xcite",
    ".    moreover it has been proved , using dispersion relations  @xcite , that only distributions in the space - like region @xmath13 are needed to describe these processes .",
    "the variables are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] .     where @xmath14.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    there are insufficient experimental data to determine the skewed parton distributions with an accuracy comparable to that of the global parton analysis of the conventional ( diagonal ) distributions .",
    "fortunately , for small @xmath15 , the skewed distributions can be computed accurately just from the knowledge of the known integrated conventional distributions . at first sight",
    "such a simplification looks surprising . on the other hand , we know that the anomalous dimensions which describe the evolution of the gegenbauer moments , @xmath16 , of the skewed distributions are equal to the corresponding anomalous dimensions of the conventional mellin moments , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of conformal invariance of the evolution equations . strictly speaking",
    ", conformal invariance is only valid at leading order ( lo ) . already at nlo @xcite ,",
    "it is violated by the running of @xmath18 , leading to a mixture of the operators at adjacent orders . but",
    "let us start with lo .    at lo we have equality of the anomalous dimensions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , due to the polynomial property @xcite , @xmath19 we have @xmath20 .",
    "that is , from the conventional global parton analyses we can determine all the gegenbauer moments of the skewed parton distributions at small @xmath15 with an accuracy of @xmath21 .",
    "then it is simply a technical problem to calculate the @xmath0 distribution of the skewed partons from the known moments .",
    "this mathematical problem is solved by the shuvaev transform  @xcite ( which we give explicitly later ) .",
    "note that at @xmath22 , in the diagonal case , there is no mixture of the mellin moments during the evolution .",
    "thus for the skewed distributions such mixing must also vanish at @xmath22 .",
    "indeed the mixture of the different operators , due to violation of conformal invariance on the dimensionful parameter @xmath23 .",
    "it is essentially trivial . in principle",
    ", it could be accounted for by using the ` correct ' argument of the qcd coupling in the uppermost cell of fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] ; namely @xmath24 and not @xmath25 . ] , is of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "thus the shuvaev transform can be used at nlo with accuracy @xmath27 , which is sufficient for the description of all diffractive processes of interest .",
    "this procedure has been called into doubt  @xcite .",
    "first , we discuss the reason for the doubt and then explain why it is not a problem in practice .",
    "the apparent problem is that to obtain the @xmath0 distributions from the moments @xmath16 we must analytically continue the moments into the complex @xmath28-plane .",
    "if there is a singularity in the right - half plane , then it may generate a non - negligible correction of @xmath29 , instead of the @xmath21 correction which came from the difference between the gegenbauer and mellin moments .",
    "this large @xmath29 correction would destroy the practical use of the shuvaev transform .",
    "so to justify the shuvaev transform we require the absence of singularities in the right - half @xmath28 plane .",
    "now , an arbitrary singularity in the right - half plane will violate the polynomial property , and so at first sight the danger is removed .",
    "however , it has been shown by radyushkin  @xcite that it is possible to form ` double distributions ' which are not identical to the shuvaev transform , but which still satisfy the polynomial property .",
    "the non - polynomial contributions , generated by different singularities of these double distributions in the right - half plane , compensate each other to guarantee polynomiality .",
    "so the danger remains . on the other hand",
    ", there is no singularity in the right - half plane in the anomalous dimensions which describe the @xmath30 evolution of the gegenbauer moments .",
    "hence the extra singularities must come only from the input distribution .",
    "now , it is natural to describe the input distribution at low @xmath0 in terms of the regge approach , which is successful in the description of high energy interactions at low scales where the conventional ( collinear ) dglap evolution for the skewed distributions starts . in the regge approach",
    "there are no singularities in the right - half plane ( @xmath31 ) in the space - like @xmath32 domain .",
    "[ t ]     dependence ) originates from the uppermost cell ; the part of the diagram enclosed by the dashed line has diagonal form due to the strong ordering of @xmath0 in the regge limit .",
    "this diagram makes clear why , in the low @xmath0 region , generalised parton distributions may be computed directly from the well known ` global ' diagonal distributions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    indeed , in the regge limit we are concerned with the leading log@xmath33 summation . hence , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ord ] we have the strong ordering @xmath34 the inequality @xmath35 means that the lower part of the diagram is described by the diagonal distribution .",
    "the only @xmath15 dependence comes from the uppermost @xmath36 cell .",
    "all other cells have @xmath37 .",
    "now , the uppermost cell already satisfies conformal invariance .",
    "moreover , at nlo level , this uppermost cell is calculated exactly in terms of the nlo coefficient functions .",
    "therefore there is no opportunity for a new singularity in the right - half @xmath31 plane .    with the above physically motivated conjecture ,",
    "the shuvaev transform survives to be of practical value .",
    "we emphasise that the conjecture , of the absence of additional singularities in the right - half plane , does not follow from first principles or symmetry arguments , but rather from the assumption of the regge form of the low @xmath0 input .",
    "note that in the time - like region , that is at @xmath38 , we have such singularities .",
    "they correspond to the wave functions of resonances with large spin .",
    "indeed one may add to the distribution , given by the shuvaev transform , an additional function with support only on the interval @xmath38 .",
    "however there is no such contribution in the calculation of the skewed partons via the shuvaev transform in the space - like domain .",
    "another argument in favour of the shuvaev prescription is the good fit of the dvcs hera data obtained at nlo and nnlo in @xcite .",
    "this fit was based on the approximation that there is only one pole .",
    "recall also the model @xcite based on the shuvaev transform and the successful description of the dvcs hera data in the dipole model @xcite where the ratio , @xmath39 , of the skewed to diagonal gluon distribution given by the shuvaev transform was used .",
    "in @xcite the shuvaev transform was criticised to be `` unpractical '' or `` too complicated '' , but see also the original discussion in  @xcite . here",
    "we present and describe a package that allows for the simple computation of the skewed distributions at small @xmath40 based on the shuvaev transform .",
    "the generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) are denoted @xcite by @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath15 is the skewing parameter , with @xmath43 as defined in fig .  [",
    "fig : var ] .",
    "in fact @xmath44 for partons emitted and absorbed at scale @xmath45 , with the momentum transfer @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the values of @xmath48 and @xmath15 do not change as we evolve in @xmath45 . in the limit @xmath49 the skewed distributions will reduce to the usual diagonal partons : @xmath50    we briefly discuss the double - integral ( that is , the shuvaev transform ) used to calculate the skewed distributions for @xmath7 in the space - like region @xmath13 .",
    "first we introduce an auxiliary function @xmath51 , whose mellin moments are equal up to normalisation to the gegenbauer moments of the skewed function .",
    "the function formed from the dglap evolution of the auxiliary function is referred to as the ` effective diagonal function ' , @xmath52 . neglecting the @xmath48 dependence",
    ", we must find the kernel @xmath53 relating @xmath52 to the skewed distribution , @xmath54 it is convenient to first weaken the singularity in the @xmath55 integral by an integration by parts .",
    "with this it can be shown that  @xcite @xmath56 \\ : \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}x^\\prime } \\left (   \\frac{q ( x^\\prime)}{| x^\\prime | } \\right ) , \\ ] ] @xmath57 \\ : \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}x^\\prime } \\left ( \\frac{g ( x^\\prime)}{| x^\\prime | } \\right ) \\:,\\ ] ] @xmath58 equations ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) and ( [ eq : shuvg ] ) are ( up to a variable substitution @xmath59 ) the form used to compute the shuvaev transform in the package decribed below .",
    "incidentally , it is also possible to solve the inverse problem .",
    "that is to obtain the diagonal distribution from a known skewed distribution @xmath60 at a given value of @xmath15 .",
    "although this is not needed for our discussion , for completeness , we give the details in the appendix .    note",
    "that the transforms , ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) and ( [ eq : shuvg ] ) , say nothing about the @xmath48 ( or @xmath61 ) dependence of the gpds . strictly speaking they are written for @xmath62 .",
    "usually the factorisation @xmath63 is assumed , where @xmath64 is just the proton form factor .",
    "we see that ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) and ( [ eq : shuvg ] ) determine the behaviour of the skewed distributions in the small @xmath40 domain entirely in terms of the diagonal distributions . before we perform the exact evaluation of these integral expressions for the gpds , it is informative to recall that approximate expressions can be obtained by making the physically reasonable small @xmath0 assumption that the diagonal partons are given by @xmath65 then we can perform the @xmath55 integration analytically .",
    "one can then use @xmath66where we have set the lower limit to zero .",
    "we have checked numerically that this is a very good approximation , with accuracy of the order of @xmath67 for @xmath68 in the small @xmath0 region .",
    "( that this approximation is good for small @xmath15 is in line with the findings of  @xcite . ) ] we obtain [ eq : shuvappr ] h_i ( x , ; t ) = n_i _ 0 ^ 1 s ^p ^_i + 1 g ( t ) with @xmath69 or @xmath70 , and where @xmath71 and 1 for quarks and the gluon respectively .    at first sight",
    "it appears that for singlet quarks ( where @xmath72 and @xmath71 ) we face a strong singularity in integral ( [ eq : shuvappr ] ) when the term @xmath73 in the denominator .",
    "fortunately the singlet quark distribution is antisymmetric in @xmath0 . to obtain the imaginary part of the integral ( [ eq : shuvq ] )",
    "we must choose @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "therefore we must treat ( [ eq : shuvappr ] ) as a principal value integral and take the difference between the @xmath78 and @xmath79 limits .",
    "thus the main singularity is cancelled and ( [ eq : shuvappr ] ) becomes integrable for any @xmath80 .",
    "note that the dominant contribution to the @xmath55 integrations of ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) and ( [ eq : shuvg ] ) comes from the region of small @xmath81 .",
    "indeed with the input given by ( [ eq : pdfpower ] ) , the integral for the quark distribution has a strong singularity at small @xmath55 [ eq : b21 ] i_q ~ x^(x^)^- _ q - 3 ( ) .",
    "however when we take the imaginary part , the @xmath55 integration is cut - off by the theta function @xmath82 at [ eq : c21 ] x^ = 1/y ( s ) ~ x + ( 1 - 2s ) , which implies that @xmath83 is always greater than @xmath84 .",
    "so we obtain the small @xmath15 behaviour @xmath85 , and the distribution ( [ eq : shuvq ] ) has the form [ eq : d21 ] h_q ( x , ) = ^- _ q - 1 f_q ( x/ ) .",
    "similarly it follows that @xmath86 .",
    "it is illuminating to evaluate the ratio @xmath87 of the gpd to its diagonal parent distribution ; that is [ eq : a22 ] r = , where the only free parameter is @xmath88 , the exponent which fixes the @xmath89 behaviour of the input diagonal partons , as in ( [ eq : pdfpower ] ) .",
    "notice that on account of ( [ eq : d21 ] ) the ratios @xmath87 at small @xmath0 and @xmath15 are a function of only the ratio of the variables @xmath90 .",
    ", at small @xmath91 versus the power @xmath88 which specifies the @xmath89 behaviour of the input diagonal parton as in ( [ eq : pdfpower ] ) .",
    "note that the quark singlet ratio has been divided by two.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    assuming the pure power behaviour of the partons , the ratios at @xmath92 are given explicitly in analytic form as @xmath93 where @xmath71 for quarks and @xmath94 for gluons .",
    "these ratios are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the off - diagonal or ` skewed ' effect ( the ratio @xmath95 ) is much stronger for singlet quarks than for gluons .",
    "the explanation is straightforward . at",
    "low @xmath0 the distributions are driven by the double leading logarithmic evolution of the gluon distribution . at each step of the evolution",
    "the momentum fractions @xmath96 are strongly ordered ( @xmath97 on fig .  1 ) .",
    "for gluons it is just the last splitting function  @xmath98 which generates the main @xmath15 dependence , or skewedness , of the distribution .",
    "however for the sea or singlet quarks it is necessary to produce a quark with the help of @xmath99 at the last splitting .",
    "the splitting function @xmath99 has no logarithmic @xmath100 singularity and so @xmath101 is the order of @xmath102 .",
    "consequently both the splitting functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 generate the asymmetry of the off - diagonal distribution . hence , at low @xmath0 , the singlet quark has a much stronger off - diagonal effect than the gluon .",
    "we emphasise that the analytical expression for the ratio @xmath95 , ( [ eq : ranalytic ] ) , is valid in the limit @xmath91 only and that it assumes a pure power behaviour of the diagonal partons , ( [ eq : pdfpower ] ) . as will be discussed below",
    ", the latter is a good approximation for global fit partons in the small @xmath0 regime .",
    "however , for @xmath105 the difference between the result of the complete ( double integral ) shuvaev transform , ( [ eq : shuvq ] , [ eq : shuvg ] ) , and the approximate analytic formula for @xmath95 , ( [ eq : ranalytic ] ) , based on the limit @xmath91 , is quite large .",

    "recall that the description of dvcs data in terms of the lo skewed distribution , given by the shuvaev approach , was not good @xcite , while at nlo we observe agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "the data have also been described in terms of a dipole model @xcite . here",
    ", the interaction of the gluon with the quark - antiquark pair produced by the photon plays the role of the nlo coefficient function @xmath151 , while the skewed effect of the nlo gluon was calculated using the shuvaev prescription .",
    "therefore , actually , the dipole approach is close to a nlo treatment of dvcs .",
    "as the numerical computation of the full shuvaev transform requires some care and can be too slow for applications , we provide a simple and fast interpolation routine in fortran77 .",
    "this includes reasonably small ( approx .",
    "3.4 mbytes ) grid files for the lo and nlo input global analyses mstw2008 @xcite , mrst2004 @xcite and cteq6.6 @xcite .",
    "these contain the information for quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "the interpolation routine and grid files can be downloaded from http://www.maths.liv.ac.uk/theorphys/research/pubcodes.html .",
    "the grid files use 85 points in @xmath0 where @xmath152 , together with 43 points in the ratio @xmath153 where @xmath154 and 20 points in @xmath30 where @xmath155 . using @xmath153 as opposed to @xmath15 as a parameter increases the interpolation accuracy as the region @xmath156 , where the skewed distributions are rising sharply ,",
    "can be sampled more densely than regions @xmath157 , where they are flatter .",
    "the @xmath0 grid points were chosen on a log scale , and the transform uses a linear interpolation on log scales for the three parameters ( apart from the bin which includes @xmath158 , where the interpolation is performed on a linear scale ) .",
    "the evolution in @xmath30 is very smooth , so fewer points in @xmath30 are needed .",
    "the accuracy of the results from the interpolation on the grid is always better than @xmath159 in the small @xmath0 regime ( and still better than @xmath160 for @xmath161 ) , and typically much better for @xmath162 or in the case of gluons .",
    "based on convergence tolerances of the double integrals evaluated in ( [ eq : shuvq ] , [ eq : shuvg ] ) , and the numerical derivatives ( of the interpolated input partons ) of one per mille , we estimate the accuracy of the grid points to be better than @xmath159 in the small @xmath0 regime .    note that while in the figures above we have shown the skewed partons only up to @xmath163 , the grid files contain information up to @xmath164 . of course at large @xmath0 and @xmath15",
    "we can not justify the results , while at small @xmath15 and large @xmath0 the skewed distributions are approaching the diagonal ones .",
    "in general there are two possibilities to parameterise gpds . one is to relate skewed distributions to the well known diagonal ( global ) parton distributions .",
    "this can be done with the help of the double distributions proposed by radyushkin @xcite .",
    "the general form contains an arbitrary new function ( up to the normalisation condition ) , but by construction it reduces to the diagonal distributions in the limit @xmath165 .",
    "the shuvaev transform is a particular case of this approach , with the advantage that after a physically reasonable assumption ( that is , no singularities in the right - half @xmath166 plane ) it gives unique gpds in the low @xmath0 domain in terms of global diagonal partons , without any new parameters .",
    "the physical reasonableness of this assumption is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : ord ] and the accompanying discussion .",
    "an alternative approach is to fit the available data , corresponding to _ both _ skewed and diagonal distributions , using an ansatz or model for the input gpds at some starting scale @xmath167 .",
    "this approach was used in a recent paper @xcite , where the moments of the gpds were parameterised in terms of beta ( @xmath168 ) functions motivated by an so(3 ) partial wave model , see section 3.2 of @xcite . in order not to lose the statistical significance of the dvcs data , which corresponds to the skewed distributions",
    ", only a small subset of global ( @xmath169 ) data were included in the analysis .",
    "moreover , we stress that the dvcs data do not cover the whole kinematic domain of @xmath0 and @xmath15 , but rather correspond to the special situation @xmath170 .",
    "it was emphasised in @xcite that it is impossible to describe hera data with a model with one leading so(3 ) partial wave , especially at lo . based on this observation ,",
    "the authors claim that gpds given by the shuvaev transform are not applicable , that is , are in contradiction with the dvcs data .",
    "note , however , that the integral corresponding to the shuvaev transform is determined directly from global diagonal partons , which have a more complicated @xmath0 behaviour .",
    "it is well known that already diagonal ` global ' data can not be described by a single regge pole ansatz .",
    "moreover global diagonal partons are poorly described at lo @xcite .",
    "the nlo corrections are large , since , in comparison with lo , they contain qualitatively new @xmath149 singularities in the splitting and coefficient functions . furthermore , note that the analytic formula for the ratio ( [ eq : ranalytic ] ) , which indeed is written for one regge pole , was given just to qualitatively illustrate the discussion",
    "going to nlo , we see no contradiction of the integral , parameter - free , shuvaev transform approach with the available low @xmath0 dvcs data @xcite . moreover , the ratios @xmath171 of skewed - to - diagonal pdfs given in fig .  7 of @xcite for the nlo @xmath113 scheme are very close to those that we obtain using the shuvaev transform with recent global partons .",
    "table [ tab : comp ] shows the agreement between the nlo @xmath113 gpds of @xcite and our values obtained using the shuvaev transform at @xmath172 for @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "it is clear from the table that the difference between the gpds based on the shuvaev transform and those obtained in @xcite by the nlo @xmath113 fit to the ` skewed ' dvcs data , is much less than the dvcs error bars .",
    ".comparison of the skewed - to - diagonal ratio for gluons @xmath175 and @xmath176 quark singlet @xmath177 at @xmath172 for scales @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "diagonal cteq6.6 m and mstw2008nlo partons are used as input to calculate the skewed distributions , and the resulting ratios are compared to the ratios as displayed in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite using their nlo @xmath113 ( @xmath178-pw ) gpds . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown how the skewed ( or generalised ) parton distributions , @xmath41 , that are needed to describe diffractive processes , can be obtained , for small @xmath0 , _ directly _ from the conventional integrated global parton densities , @xmath179 .",
    "this parameter - free method is based on the shuvaev transform , and is applicable to accuracy at lo . ]",
    "@xmath27 at nlo , which should be sufficient for the description of all diffractive processes of interest . for the reasons given in the previous section the alternative approach of ref .",
    "@xcite does not have the advantage of being parameter free .",
    "first we identified the reason for the doubts which had been raised concerning the use of the shuvaev transform .",
    "further , we noted that the shuvaev transform follows from the physically - motivated conjecture that the small @xmath0 input is specified by regge physics , and so does not generate any singularities in the right - half ( @xmath31 ) plane in the space - like ( @xmath180 ) domain .",
    "the transform therefore has practical applicability .",
    "we then investigated the kinematic range of reliability of the simplified analytic formula ( [ eq : ranalytic ] ) .",
    "this formula was derived for @xmath91 , assuming that the unintegrated parton distributions @xmath181 have a power - like @xmath182 behaviour .",
    "the ` analytic ' formula was only introduced to illustrate some of the qualitative features of gpds .    in order to obtain _",
    "accurate _ generalised parton distributions at nlo at _ any _ small @xmath40 , we performed a detailed computation of the integrals of the shuvaev transform .",
    "finally , these computations allow us to provide a readily accessible package which allows the evaluation of gpds for arbitrary small @xmath40 in the space - like @xmath32 domain .",
    "these nlo gpds should facilitate the theoretical description of _ all _ diffractive processes of interest .",
    "although we do not need the inverse transformation for the calculation of the skewed distributions for small @xmath15 from diagonal partons using the shuvaev transform , it is still worth noting that the inverse problem is solvable .",
    "here we shall briefly clarify the inverse transformation and show that the regions @xmath183 and @xmath184 transform separately .",
    "our aim is to find the function @xmath185 whose mellin moments , @xmath186 are equal to gegenbauer moments of the gpd @xmath60 , @xmath187 @xmath188 . here for definiteness we consider the non - singlet channel , the singlet one can be treated in the same manner .    with the generating function for gegenbauer polynomials ,",
    "@xmath189 @xmath190 the moments take the form @xmath191 where the contour of the @xmath48-integration goes in the complex plane around @xmath192 , while the integral over @xmath193 yields the normalisation .",
    "integrating by parts over @xmath194 ( this is needed to make the kernel less singular ) we rewrite this expression as @xmath195 the contour of @xmath48-integration can be shrunk to the cut of the radical in the integrand , @xmath196 where the values @xmath197 $ ] determine the real ( for @xmath198 ) interval , in which @xmath199 these relations show that the desired function is given by the integral transformation @xmath200h(y,\\xi),\\ ] ] with the kernel @xmath201,\\ ] ] @xmath202 note that for @xmath203 the transformation becomes close to the identity , @xmath204 .    if @xmath205 the branch points @xmath206 are complex . in this case",
    "the function @xmath207 will be defined on the segment lying in the complex plane .",
    "thus the inverse transform does not exist as a real function for the whole interval .",
    "we thank markus diehl , dieter mller and graeme watt for valuable discussions , and graeme watt for the provision of the mstw2008 partons prior to publication .",
