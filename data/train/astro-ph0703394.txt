    "the massive cluster survey ( macs ) was launched in 1998 with the goal of compiling the first large , statistical sample of very x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "a comparison of the flux limits and solid angles of various x - ray cluster surveys conducted previously demonstrates that the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) was then  and remains until today  the only existing x - ray dataset that allows these extremely rare systems to be detected in significant numbers ( fig .",

    "a detailed description of the macs survey strategy is given in the same paper . in brief , the macs cluster sample is compiled by applying limits in x - ray flux and spectral hardness to all sources listed in the rass bright source catalogue ( bsc , voges et al .",
    "1999 ) that fall within the part of the extragalactic sky that is observable from mauna kea ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and by conducting an identification program that combines searching various astronomical object catalogues with extensive optical imaging observations .",
    "likely cluster candidates are then targeted in spectroscopic observations and added to the macs catalogue if their measured redshift exceeds @xmath5 .",
    "although the required optical follow - up observations are currently complete only for the macs bright sample ( defined as comprising all sources with bsc detect fluxes in excess of @xmath6 erg@xmath7 @xmath8 in the 0.12.4 kev band , ebeling et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) , we gave priority to the most distant cluster candidates regardless of x - ray flux down to the overall macs flux limit of @xmath9 erg@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "we are thus confident that the sample presented here , the set of the twelve macs clusters at @xmath0 , is complete at the nominal 90% level aimed at for the entire survey .",
    "we assume a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 throughout .",
    "as they were detected in the course of the survey , macs clusters at @xmath0 were given highest priority in our in - depth follow - up observations .",
    "eight of the twelve clusters forming the final sample were targeted in dedicated observations at 30 ghz with the bima interferometer ; a strong detection of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect was obtained for all of them ( laroque et al .",
    "all newly discovered clusters were observed with the acis - i instrument aboard the chandra x - ray observatory in guaranteed time made available by chandra telescope scientist leon van spectroscopy . in december 2006",
    "we completed moderately deep observations with the suprimecam wide - field imager on the subaru 8.3 m telescope on mauna kea in the b , v , r , i , and z@xmath14 passbands .",
    "in addition , u - band images of all systems have been obtained with the megacam 1-degree imager on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "high - resolution imaging of the cluster cores was performed with the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope ( program i d 09722 , pi ebeling ) in the f555w and f814w filters .",
    "returning to groundbased observations , we conducted extensive spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the fields of all twelve clusters with multi - object spectrographs on 8m - class telescopes on mauna kea ( gemini , keck - i , keck - ii ) ; a catalogue of more than 3,000 redshifts of galaxies in macs cluster fields can be found in barrett & ebeling ( 2007 ) .    a wealth of science results , ranging from an in - depth study of the massive cooling - core cluster macsj1423.8@xmath152404 , through work on galaxy evolution in clusters , to a study of the large - scale structure surrounding the most distant macs clusters , has been obtained from these observations ( laroque et al .",

    "to facilitate the use of this statistically complete sample in studies conducted by the scientific community in general we here present the macs @xmath0 catalogue listing the clusters fundamental physical properties , such as x - ray position , redshift , radial velocity dispersion , x - ray fluxes and luminosities , and x - ray gas temperatures ( table  1 ) . to allow the computation of search volumes for cosmological and astrophysical applications we also list the x - ray detect flux from the rass bsc and provide a look - up table of the macs selection function in table  2 .",

    "overlaid are isodensity contours of the adaptively smoothed x - ray emission in the @xmath18 kev band as observed with chandra . note the wide range of x - ray morphologies , indicating that the macs sample is neither biased in favor of cooling - core systems ( which feature the highest central x - ray surface brightness levels ) nor in favor of heavily disturbed clusters ( which may be temporarily boosted in their x - ray luminosity and temperature due to merger - induced shocks ) .",
    "a qualitative assessment of the morphology of the cluster gas as traced by the x - ray surface brightness distribution is given in the final column of table  1 .",
    "we present the statistically complete sample of the twelve most distant macs clusters , all of which feature redshifts of @xmath0 and ten of which are new discoveries .",
    "extensive follow - up observations at wavelengths from the x - ray to the radio passbands have confirmed that these are indeed exceptionally massive systems and thus the high - redshift counterparts of the best studied massive clusters in the local universe .",
    "results from several studies on individual clusters or the sample as a whole have been published ; additional studies , ranging from a comprehensive weak - lensing analysis to cosmological applications of the macs sample , are well advanced . in recognition of the legacy character of this sample we provide in this paper an overview of fundamental properties of all twelve clusters as well as a tabulated version of the macs selection function to facilitate the use of our sample by the scientific community for a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological applications .",
