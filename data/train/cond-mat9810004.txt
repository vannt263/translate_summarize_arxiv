    "it is well known that the superconducting transition in the high-@xmath5 superconductors shows a dramatic @xcite field - induced broadening . in particular this phenomenon",
    "prevents from determining the upper critical field @xmath15 for high @xmath5 superconductors by traditional methods .",
    "the origin of the broadening is still unclear and remains a subject of investigations @xcite - @xcite .    as a source of information on superconducting transition properties",
    "the results of microwave measurements performed by technique of esr spectrometers may be useful .",
    "it has been found @xcite - @xcite that temperature dependence of the microwave response of high-@xmath5 superconductors , recorded by an esr spectrometer with modulating magnetic field , exhibits a peak near @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that in this case the measured signal represents the derivative @xmath3 , where r is a microwave absorption . in this connection",
    "it has been supposed @xcite that the temperature dependence of @xmath3 in the vicinity of @xmath5 is similar to that of @xmath4 , as it occurs for traditional superconductors , and so the observed @xmath3 -peak may be used for analysis of superconducting transition in the high- @xmath5 superconductors .",
    "an original point of the present paper is that we have fulfilled the direct measurement of the derivative @xmath4 for a single crystal y - ba - cu - o and established the essential difference of its temperature dependence from that of the derivative @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that this difference is due to the field - induced broadening of superconducting transition .",
    "in the experiment the esr spectrometer se / x-2543 `` radiopan '' with the x - band @xmath16 resonant cavity ( @xmath17 was employed .",
    "a usual field arrangement with @xmath18 , where h is the static field and @xmath19 - the microwave field was used ( see insert in fig .",
    "the crystals were oriented with @xmath20 .",
    "the angle @xmath6 between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 could be varied by rotating the crystal around the @xmath23 direction and could be fixed with an accuracy of @xmath24 .    in order to investigate the superconducting transition at low fields",
    "some modifications are made because the electromagnet of esr spectrometer has remnant magnetic field with @xmath25 .",
    "the resonator is taken out from the large electromagnet and for creating low fields a pair of helmholtz coils is used . to ensure that the field is zero at the zero current in the coils , the resonator and coils were placed inside the cylindrical permalloy screen , reducing the geomagnetic field more than hundred times .",
    "a light - beam assisted temperature - control system operating within a temperature range from 77 to 180 k was specially designed for this experiment @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this system is the feasibility of modulating the temperature of a sample with a frequency of 80 hz and amplitude of @xmath26 k. the rms temperature instability over a 5-min time interval is within 0.06 k , the temperature gradient in a sample is - 0.01 k / mm for @xmath27 k , and system relaxation time is 1 - 10 s.    the lock - in detection was used for recording the modulated microwave absorption for the following cases :    * at frequency 100 khz when modulating magnetic field was applied ( maximum modulation amplitude @xmath28 = 10 oe ) ,    * at frequency 80 hz in the case of modulating the temperature of a sample .",
    "it should be noted that a direct measurement of the temperature modulation amplitude represents a rather complicated problem .",
    "here we can point that , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , its value can be chosen in the range @xmath29 , and that its variation over the transition region does not exceed 10% .",
    "since the amplitude is much less than the transition width , the observed signal can be considered as the derivative @xmath4 .",
    "all the measurements were carried out at the constant microwave power level of -17 db ( 130 mw ) .",
    "the single crystals were grown from the melt @xmath30 .",
    "the mixture was heated to @xmath31 in the @xmath32 crucible at the rate @xmath33 , and then cooled to the room temperature at the same rate .",
    "the crystal composition was determined by the method of x - ray micro - spectroscopy and corresponded to the formula @xmath30 .",
    "the lattice parameters , as determined by the x - ray diffraction , were : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the crystals were shaped as thin plates with thickness @xmath37 along the @xmath21 and area of @xmath38 in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "the crystal samples exhibiting simple - shaped single peak in the temperature dependence of the derivatives @xmath3 and @xmath4 were selected for detailed studies .",
    "the so called `` low - field '' signals @xcite were absent in all samples .",
    "these conditions ensured that the observed temperature dependence of the measured signal was determined exclusively by the superconducting transition .",
    "it should be stressed also , that no irreversible effects were observed in the studied samples .    in general 5 samples were investigated .",
    "all the results obtained in the experiment might be summarized in several regularities demonstrated in figs . 1 - 3 ( all figures refer to the same sample ) .",
    "the most important result is the qualitative difference of the temperature dependencies of the derivatives @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "1 , that the corresponding peaks are shifted one with respect to another in the temperature scale .",
    "moreover , the @xmath3 peak is broader than the @xmath4 peak and has an asymmetric shape with a clearly seen low temperature tail . a different behavior of these peaks with increasing external field is also seen in fig .",
    "1 . the amplitude of the @xmath3 peak decreases faster than that of the @xmath4 one , and shows a larger shift toward lower temperature .",
    "we have also studied an asymptotic behavior with the decreasing external field , @xmath40 .",
    "it was found that below 20 oe the amplitude and position of the @xmath3 peak remain constant , in the range of error limits , and its shape became more symmetrical with decreasing field , approaching that of the @xmath4 peak .",
    "the latter did not experience any changes down to the lowest attainable field strength of @xmath41 oe .",
    "measurements of the derivative @xmath3 at @xmath42 are subject to a specific problem .",
    "the corresponding @xmath43 signal was recorded at the values of field modulation amplitude h compatible with the condition @xmath44 .",
    "special tests showed that this condition fulfilled as long as @xmath45 .",
    "the latter condition made it difficult to carry out measurements at @xmath46 , and at h=1 oe the @xmath43 signal fell to the noise level .",
    "this should be kept in mind when considering our conclusion about the constancy of the @xmath3 peak amplitude and position at @xmath42 .      at low fields , @xmath49 ,",
    "the @xmath4 peak was practically constant in the range @xmath50 , whereas a significant changes of the @xmath3 peak features were observed .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath3 peak decreased gradually , reaching at @xmath51 about 1/10 of its initial value , while its position shifted slightly toward higher temperature ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at high fields",
    "these peaks showed a reverse behavior : the @xmath4 peak changed significantly ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , whereas the @xmath3 peak remains unchanged .",
    "@xmath54 the function @xmath53 describes the `` equiabsorption '' line in the phase plane ( h , t ) .",
    "such a line in the region of the superconducting transition is commonly interpreted as the temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath55 .",
    "this interpretation is valid provided that the dependence of the line s slope @xmath56 on the absorption level r is weak in the temperature interval of the transition at any values of h ( otherwise , the lines @xmath57 with different r would diverge in the phase plane , and choosing of @xmath58 for @xmath55 would be uncertain ) .",
    "usually , this condition is fulfilled in the low - temperature superconductors and in this case , according to eq.(1 ) , the temperature dependencies of @xmath3 and @xmath4 have to be similar . note , that this is possible only if the curve @xmath59,describing the superconducting transition , is shifted as a whole with changing field h.    it is seen in fig.1 that the peaks in the temperature dependencies of the derivatives @xmath3 and @xmath4 , for a given high-@xmath5 superconductor , are differently shaped , and , which is more important , are shifted one with respect to another in the temperature scale .",
    "this means , according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , that the value of @xmath60 is not uniform in the transition region and therefore should be essentially dependent on the absorption level . hence , the relative shift of the peaks seen in the graphs of fig.1 is an evidence of the field - induced broadening of the superconducting transition .",
    "it should be underlined also , that the comparative analysis of the peaks @xmath3 and @xmath4 allows one to observe the transition s broadening even at very low fields .",
    "a direct observation of this effect would require a much higher precision of temperature measurements .",
    "thus , we hope that the results described above may be used in testing the existing models of the field - induced broadening in high-@xmath5 superconductors .",
