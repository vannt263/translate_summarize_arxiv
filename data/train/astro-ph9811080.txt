    "the elemental abundances inferred from x - ray observations of elliptical galaxies are sensitive diagnostics of models of the formation and evolution of the hot gas in these systems .",
    "for example , the relative abundances of the @xmath1-process elements with respect to fe are affected by the relative contributions of type ia and type ii supernovae to the enrichment of the hot gas ( e.g. david , jones , & forman 1991 ) .",
    "the standard models that rely on type ia supernova to enrich the hot gas tend to predict fe abundances well in excess of solar ( e.g. ciotti et al .",
    "smaller fe abundances can be accommodated by other models ( e.g. fujita et al .",
    "1997 ; brighenti & mathews 1998b ) .",
    "most studies of ellipticals based on x - ray spectral data from the _ asca _ satellite @xcite find very sub - solar fe abundances @xmath5 .",
    "these low abundances are generally deduced from fitting isothermal models of the hot gas to the accumulated _ asca _ spectra within circular apertures of typical radius @xmath6-@xmath7 .",
    "these findings have been christened as a `` standard model '' by loewenstein & mushotzky who review the results obtained from the _ asca _ spectra of ellipticals .    in a recent study of the _ asca _ data of 20 bright ellipticals , buote & fabian ( 1998 ; hereafter bf ) concluded that the spectra of the brightest galaxies in their sample require at least two temperature components in the hot gas ( in addition to any possible emission from discrete sources ) .",
    "the multiphase models predict fe abundances for these galaxies that are generally consistent with solar .",
    "these results for the brightest ellipticals highlight the sensitivity of the fe abundance to the spectral model .    these results of bf also do not fit into the standard model and have been criticized by loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1998 ; also loewenstein 1998 ) in two key respects .",
    "first , loewenstein & mushotzky state that the _ asca _ data can generally be described by two - component models consisting of one `` soft '' component of isothermal hot gas and another `` hard '' component due to discrete sources .",
    "second , they claim that the k@xmath1 emission line ratios of si xiv / xiii are very consistent with these isothermal models but are only marginally consistent with the multiphase models of bf .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the _ asca _ data of the brightest ellipticals to address these criticisms and thus determine whether indeed isothermal models with very sub - solar fe abundances are adequate descriptions of the x - ray spectra of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we extend the work of bf in the following respects : ( 1 ) we examine in detail the predictions of the standard model using two - component models where one component is isothermal hot gas and the other is a high - temperature bremsstrahlung component presumably due to discrete sources ; ( 2 ) the equivalent widths and ratios of the si and s line blends measured locally for each galaxy are used to constrain the isothermal and multiphase models obtained from broad - band analysis ; and ( 3 ) we examine whether the radial temperature gradients found by studies of the _ rosat _ data of bright ellipticals are consistent with the standard model .",
    "we focus our analysis on ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , ngc 4636 , and ngc 5044 which are among the brightest ellipticals in x - rays and have _ asca _ data with the best signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) for the sample studied by bf .",
    "moreover , these galaxies were observed during the _ asca _ performance - verification ( pv ) phase at which time the performance of the ccds , in particular the energy resolution , had not yet degraded from radiation damage ( see dotani et al .",
    "this is especially important for our local measurements of the si and s lines .",
    "data from a very deep exposure of ngc 4636 has also become available to the public .",
    "these new data for ngc 4636 have the highest s / n in our sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ obs ]",
    "we discuss the observations and reduction of the _ asca _ data .",
    "the broad - band spectral fitting is presented in detail in section [ broad ] . in section [ lines ]",
    "we summarize our measurements of the si and s line blends and compare them to the models obtained from the broad - band fits .",
    "we analyze the _ rosat _ data and compare the results to the models derived from fitting the _ asca _ data in section [ rosat ] . in section [ disc ]",
    "we evaluate our results in light of the standard model and discuss the implications of the derived metal abundances . finally , we present a detailed summary of our results in section [ conc ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     best - fitting absorbed mekal model for the pspc data of each radial bin of ngc 1399 . only the energies 0.5 - 2 kev are included in these fits which is most important for the central bin as discussed in section [ rosspec ] .",
    "( see table [ tab.center ] for errors on the parameters of the central and outer bins . )",
    "we have shown that there is good overall agreement between the multiphase models obtained for the _ asca _ data and the radial temperature profiles obtained by representing the _ rosat _ pspc spectra as a series of isothermal models as a function of radius within the radii defined by the _ asca _ apertures .",
    "these temperature gradients implied by the pspc , however , appear to be very inconsistent with the isothermal _ asca _ models for ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 . owing to the larger uncertainties for ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 , the pspc temperature gradients do not clearly favor any of the _ asca _ models over another .",
    "we would like to better assess the extent to which the temperature gradients inferred from the pspc data favor the multiphase _ asca _ models .",
    "although joint fitting of the pspc and _ asca _ data , as mentioned above , is not useful , an approach that takes advantage of the spatial resolution of the pspc is to construct a model for each galaxy that is the sum of the isothermal models within the _ asca _ aperture .",
    "this composite model can then be fitted directly to the _ asca _ data .",
    "the only free parameters are the total normalization and the redshifts ( because of the calibrations issues discussed in section [ calib ] ) .    by summing the best - fitting isothermal models over the radial bins within the _ asca _ aperture , we constructed composite pspc models for each system ; in table [ tab.n1399 ] we list the parameters of ngc 1399 for illustration .",
    "we use the pspc models derived from fitting the restricted energy range 0.5 - 2 kev since the isothermal approximation is better suited for the central bin of each galaxy for this energy range as discussed above . upon fitting these models to the _ asca _ sis data we obtain good qualitative fits over the whole sis energy range for ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 . for each of these galaxies",
    "there is a substantial residual near 1 kev which prevents a good formal fit ; this residual can be largely removed in each case by changing the individual temperatures of the composite pspc model within their 90% errors .",
    "agreement can not be so easily achieved with ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 because , in addition to residuals near 1 kev similar to ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 , the pspc models are clearly deficient in emission above @xmath8 kev .",
    "this is not surprising since the limited bandwidth of the pspc does not allow strong constraints on components ( from plasma or discrete sources ) which have temperatures @xmath9 kev . upon adding a bremsstrahlung model to the pspc model of ngc 4636 the fit improves substantially .",
    "interestingly , the residuals of the fit of this pspc+brem model for ngc 4636 are almost identical in shape to those of the cooling flow model fit to the _ asca _ data in figure [ fig.n4636_multit ] .",
    "perhaps a more interesting comparison of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ models is achieved via simulation .",
    "that is , for each of the composite isothermal pspc models we simulate an _ asca _ sis observation appropriate for each galaxy ; i.e. the same exposure and response as the total summed sis data ( see section [ obs ] ) .",
    "( prior to each simulation the pspc models are re - scaled to best match the flux of the sis data though the relative normalizations of the individual components are preserved . )",
    "we then analyzed these simulated data analogously to the real _ asca _ data as done in section [ broad ] .",
    "our goal is to examine whether fitting these simulated _ asca _ data can reproduce in detail the rich behavior found when fitting the real _ asca _ data .    in figure [ fig.sim ]",
    "we plot the simulated sis data for ngc 1399 with the best - fitting isothermal and two - temperature models .",
    "the isothermal model consists of an absorbed mekal model with variable relative abundances and a bremsstrahlung component modified by galactic absorption .",
    "this 1t+brem model delivers a marginally unacceptable fit to the simulated sis data : @xmath10 , @xmath11 for 127 dof .",
    "the residuals near 1 kev are very similar to those in figure [ fig.n1399_1 t ] for the real sis data , though of somewhat smaller magnitude .",
    "( note that the 1t+brem model with relative abundances fixed at their solar values is a considerably worse fit @xmath12 and has larger residuals near 1 kev in better agreement with figure [ fig.n1399_1 t ] . )",
    "the best - fitting temperature , @xmath13 kev , and fe abundance , @xmath14 , are very similar to those determined from the real _ asca _ data ( table [ tab.params ] ) ; the column density , @xmath15 @xmath16 is somewhat smaller .",
    "moreover , the ne abundance is zero for this 1t+brem fit and the o and mg abundances are @xmath17 that of fe .",
    "the two - temperature ( figure [ fig.sim ] ) and multiphase cooling flow models are excellent fits to the simulated sis data of ngc 1399 and also have parameters in good overall agreement with those determined from the real _ asca _ data ( tables [ tab.params ] and [ tab.cf ] ) : @xmath18 , @xmath19 for dof = ( 131,132 ) for the 2 t and cf+1 t model respectively .",
    "( both models have relative abundances with respect to fe fixed at their solar values and note that a bremsstrahlung components is not included since it does not improve the fits in either case . ) the values of @xmath20 kev and @xmath21 kev for the 2 t model and @xmath22 kev for the cooling - flow model agree reasonably well with the real _ asca _ fits .",
    "we also reproduce the galactic columns on the hotter components and excess absorption on the colder components , though the excess is still a factor of two below the values listed in table [ tab.params ] and [ tab.cf ] for ngc 1399 .",
    "both the cooling - flow and two - temperature models give @xmath23 which is about half that obtained from the actual _ asca _ data .",
    "however , this is consistent with the pspc model listed in table [ tab.n1399 ] but should not be considered `` real '' in particular because the low abundance of the inner bin is probably an artifact of fitting a isothermal model to a spectrum composed of multiple temperature components .",
    "the fits to the simulated sis data of ngc 5044 behave analogously to ngc 1399 and essentially reproduce the isothermal and multiphase results of fitting the real _ asca _ data .",
    "the 1t+brem models , though , deserve special mention since we find that fitting the simulated sis data requires a ne abundance of @xmath24 solar and a ni abundance of @xmath4 solar .",
    "the ne and ni abundances are very different from fe ( 0.3 solar ) and allowing them to be free parameters significantly improved the fits as also found when fitting the real _ asca _ data .",
    "thus , these peculiar abundances for the 1t+brem models do not have to be explained by problems with the mekal plasma code .",
    "as expected , the results for ngc 4472 are similar to ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 except that the derived temperatures are lower than obtained from the real _ asca _ data which can be attributed to the deficiency in emission above @xmath8 kev mentioned above . on the other hand , we find that fitting the simulated sis data for ngc 4636 gives results very similar to those found for ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 except that the 1 t model with variable relative abundances is an acceptable fit ;",
    "unlike the real _ asca _ data , we do not require a bremsstrahlung component for the pspc models consistent with the deficiency of emission above 3 kev mentioned above .",
    "for the most part the parameters derived for the 1 t model agree very well with those listed in table [ tab.params ] for the 1t+brem fits to the real _ asca _ data .",
    "even super - solar na abundance is required , though the best - fit value of 5.9 solar is less than that listed in table [ tab.params ] .",
    "in contrast to the broad - band fits of the real _ asca _ data of ngc 4636 , the two - temperature models are much better fits to the simulated _ asca _ sis data than the isothermal models and they are not improved significantly when allowing for variable relative abundances .",
    "the best - fitting temperatures of the 2 t model actually agree well with those found for the real data in tables [ tab.params ] and [ tab.cf ] ; i.e. @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 kev . although the best - fitting abundance @xmath27 is larger than that inferred from the real data , there is considerable leverage in the abundance errors in the pspc models to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "similarly , excess absorption is implied for both components ( similar amounts on each component ) of the 2 t model , much of which can be reduced within the errors of 0.5 - 2 kev pspc fits ( see table [ tab.center ] ) .",
    "overall the fits of the multiphase models to the simulated _ asca _ data of ngc 4636 behave quite similarly to the fits of the real ( and simulated ) _ asca _ data of the other galaxies .",
    "it very likely that that the emission above @xmath8 kev lacking in the _ rosat _ pspc isothermal models of ngc 4636 accounts for the differences in the multiphase fits to the real and simulated sis data .    in conclusion ,",
    "the temperature gradients constructed by radially varying isothermal models of the _ rosat _ pspc data are very consistent with the _ asca _ data of ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 5044 and strongly favor multiphase models of the hot gas in these systems .",
    "our analysis also shows that many of the peculiar abundances derived for the isothermal models of the real _ asca _ data ( table [ tab.params ] ) of all the galaxies can be produced by forcing an isothermal model to fit the multiphase spectrum generated by the composite pspc models .",
    "although the pspc models suggest the spectral properties of ngc 4636 are quite similar to the other galaxies , strong conclusions can not be drawn from the radially varying isothermal models of the pspc data of ngc 4636 and ngc 4472 since they fail to produce the _ asca _ emission above @xmath8 kev .",
    "as remarked in the introduction most previous studies of ellipticals based on _ asca _ data within a single aperture find that the spectra of these objects are well represented by a component of isothermal hot gas and ( if needed ) a high temperature bremsstrahlung component to account for possible emission from discrete sources .",
    "the evidence for this `` standard model '' is reviewed by loewenstein & mushotzky and loewenstein .",
    "these review articles go further and assert that the k@xmath1 emission line ratios si xiv / si xiii favor the isothermal models obtained from broad - band spectral fitting and are at best marginally consistent with the multiphase models described in bf .",
    "the accumulated body of evidence from our x - ray analysis of these galaxies strongly favors multiphase models for the hot gas over isothermal models .",
    "first , in every case the broad - band spectral fits of the _ asca _ data within a single aperture rule out the isothermal models having relative abundances with respect to fe fixed at the solar values . even if the relative abundances are allowed to vary the isothermal models remain poor fits for ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 5044 especially when the mekal model ( with its superior modeling of the fe l shell transitions with respect to rs ) is used .",
    "the multiphase models with relative abundances fixed at their solar values provide superior fits to these galaxies .",
    "( the two - temperature model for ngc 4636 is also a slightly better fit though it requires variable relative abundances . )",
    "we have shown in section [ lines ] that isothermal models generally under - predict the equivalent widths of the si and s lines of ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , ngc 5044 , and ngc 4636 while much better agreement with the _ asca _ data is provided by multiphase models .",
    "the multiphase models , as a whole , also better describe the measured si xiv / si xiii and s xvi / xv ratios . even for ngc 4636 , which displays the smallest improvement for the two - temperature model over the isothermal model for the broad - band spectral fits ( section [ broad ] ) , the line ratios and equivalent widths of si and s clearly favor the two - temperature model .",
    "hence , whereas the previously cited review articles found support for isothermal models using only the si ratio , we find that consideration of both the ratios and equivalent widths of the si and s line blends strongly favors the multiphase models .",
    "our final evidence is obtained by exploiting the superior spatial resolution of the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "the pspc data are generally consistent with a series of isothermal models which vary with radius within the apertures used for analysis of the _ asca _ data . using different approaches ( sections [ rosspec ] and [ rosasca ] )",
    "we find that the temperature gradients inferred from the _ rosat _ pspc data ( section [ rosat ] ) are inconsistent with the isothermal models derived from fitting the _ asca _ data within a single - aperture but are very consistent with the multiphase models , especially for ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 .    in light of this evidence",
    "we would argue that the standard model for these brightest ellipticals should be revised as follows : ( 1 ) the spectra within the _ asca _ apertures consist of at least two temperature components for the hot gas ; ( 2 ) the temperature declines towards the center as indicated by the temperature profiles deduced from the _ rosat _ pspc ; ( 3 ) the fe abundances are approximately 1 - 2 solar and the relative abundances of the elements with respect to fe are also consistent with solar ; ( 4 ) excess absorption above the galactic value is indicated for the colder temperature components which declines rapidly with increasing radius until the absorption is consistent with the galactic value for the hotter temperatures at the outer radii ; ( 5 ) the _ asca _ spectra are also consistent with a bremsstrahlung component arising from discrete sources contributing @xmath28 to the total emission measure .    to escape this version of a standard model ( at least for these brightest ellipticals ) one has to invoke serious errors in the plasma codes and/or the calibration of the _ asca _ sis .",
    "( of course , errors of such magnitude would render invalid all existing results of significance for both isothermal and multiphase models . )",
    "the relative calibration of _ asca _ and the _ sax _ satellite has been examined in detail and no serious discrepancies have been found apart from the small differences in the energy response below 1 kev discussed in section [ calib ] ( e.g. orr et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the fe l shell emission lines in the plasma codes has been tested previously by hwang et al . who used _ asca _ sis data to show that the fe abundance of m87 deduced from analysis of the fe k shell lines near 6.5 kev is very consistent with that inferred from broad - band spectral fitting that includes the fe l shell emission lines .",
    "since the average temperature of m87 is @xmath29 kev , this consistency test may not be entirely appropriate for normal ellipticals with @xmath30 kev .",
    "however , bf tested the accuracy of the fe l shell lines for normal ellipticals by comparing the temperatures and abundances derived from fitting mekal and rs models over a restricted energy region where the fe l lines dominate the spectrum .",
    "these results were then compared to the fits with the fe l energy region excluded .",
    "they found good agreement between the temperatures and abundances in both cases , especially for the mekal model .    in our present paper",
    "we have found that excellent fits to both the _ asca _ sis and gis data are achieved by multiphase models that use the mekal plasma code .",
    "comparison of fits using the mekal and rs plasma codes shows that , as expected , the mekal code is more accurate and also that remaining inaccuracies in the code are most likely insufficient to negate the evidence in support of multiphase models ( section [ ass ] ) .",
    "hence , we do not find any evidence that errors in the plasma codes near the fe l energy region ( or calibration errors ) are sufficient to change qualitatively the evidence for multiphase hot gas with approximately solar abundances presented in this paper .",
    "recently arimoto et al .",
    "have shown that the stellar fe abundances deduced from optical observations of a large sample of ellipticals are approximately solar when averaged over an effective radius for each galaxy .",
    "this agrees quite well with the fe abundances predicted by the multiphase models computed within the @xmath3 _ asca _ apertures of the ellipticals in our sample but is inconsistent with the sub - solar fe abundances predicted by the isothermal models .",
    "comparable fe abundances in stars and the hot gas do not reconcile the standard chemical models where the hot gas is enriched by type ia supernovae ( e.g. ciotti et al . 1993 ) .",
    "there is preliminary evidence that the fe abundances deduced from optical data are in fact @xmath31 solar when averaged over an effective radius for each galaxy @xcite . if we take the stellar fe abundances to be 0.5 solar and the fe abundances in the hot gas to be 1 solar , then using equation ( 1 ) of arimoto et al .",
    "we have that the standard enrichment models require a type ia supernovae rate of @xmath32 snu .",
    "this is a factor of 2.6 below the type ia sn rate of @xmath33 snu reported by capallero et al . , although this discrepancy can be reduced below a factor of two if an fe abundance of 1.2 solar for the hot gas is used instead .",
    "such a modest increase is still consistent with the range of fe abundances obtained for the multiphase _ asca _ models .",
    "thus , if the stellar fe abundances are near 0.5 solar then the fe abundances of the hot gas predicted by the multiphase models of the _ asca _ data can be produced to within a factor of two by the standard chemical enrichment models ( e.g. ciotti et al .",
    "this small discrepancy essentially disappears if we increase the fe abundances we have obtained by a factor of 1.44 to reflect the meteoritic solar abundances instead of the photospheric values we have used  see ishimaru & arimoto .",
    "it should be mentioned that the 1 - 2 solar abundances for fe in the hot gas are also consistent with other scenarios involving both homogeneous @xcite and inhomogeneous cooling flows @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the abundances vary within the relatively large apertures used to analyze the _ asca _ data .",
    "in fact , the cooling flow model of ngc 5044 indicates that the colder gas , which must be more centrally concentrated to be consistent with the _ rosat _ temperature profiles , has higher metallicity than the hotter gas .",
    "abundance gradients are also inferred from analysis of radially varying isothermal models of these galaxies with _ rosat _ ( see section [ rosat ] ) and with similar models of the _ asca _ data of ngc 5846 @xcite . however , these results in themselves are not compelling since the isothermal approximation need not be valid , especially for the bins near the centers ( see figure [ fig.pspc ] ) .    the 1 - 2 solar fe abundances predicted by the multiphase models are substantially larger than the values of @xmath34 solar typically found for the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in a rich cluster ( fukazawa et al .",
    "if the fe abundances for these brightest elliptical galaxies in our sample can be extrapolated to the ellipticals formed in rich clusters , then simple models of the chemical enrichment of the icm by the hot gas expelled from elliptical galaxies in rich clusters can fit the observations if most of the icm is primordial ( e.g. loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "the relative abundances with respect to fe deduced from the two - temperature models ( section [ 2 t ] ) also favor near - solar values and are consistent with the trend discovered by fukazawa et al .",
    "that the si / fe abundance is nearly solar for the least massive systems such as large ellipticals and small groups of galaxies and increases with the temperature of the system to a value of @xmath8 solar for rich clusters .",
    "however , the solar si / fe abundances indicated by both our two - temperature and cooling flow models imply nearly solar si abundances for these galaxies which are similar to those found in rich clusters by fukazawa et al . ; i.e. the solar si abundances predicted by the multiphase models are not consistent with the trend shown in figure 2 of fukazawa et al .",
    "wherein the si abundance of ellipticals should have very sub - solar values .",
    "the two - temperature models tend to provide slightly better broad - band fits to the _ asca _ spectra than the cooling flow models .",
    "the best - fitting cooling flow models , however , predict si and s line fluxes for ngc 1399 and ngc 4472 that agree with the _ asca _ sis data slightly better than the best - fitting two - temperature models .",
    "buote et al .",
    "have shown that two - temperature models are very flexible and , in particular , can approximate to high accuracy a multiphase cooling flow spectrum throughout the _ asca _ bandpass . with the _ asca _ data",
    "we thus can not ascertain reliably whether the spectra consist of only two phases or whether the two - temperature models merely provide good approximations to spectra which have a continuum of temperature components .",
    "there are physical models for the hot gas in ellipticals which accommodate only two phases .",
    "brighenti & mathews find that their most successful models of the _ rosat _ temperature and surface brightness profiles of ngc 4472 require their isothermal cooling flow model be supplemented with hot gas accreted from the surrounding medium . in this scenario",
    "the spectra observed within the _ asca _ apertures of the ellipticals in our sample are the projection of two nearly isothermal components  a colder component arising from the isothermal cooling flow and a hotter component from the accreted hot gas .",
    "( a related scenario for galaxy clusters with cd galaxies is sometimes invoked as an alternative to multiphase cooling flow models ; e.g. xu et al .",
    "1998 . ) the approximately solar abundances deduced from the _ asca _ data can also be reproduced by such two - temperature models @xcite , although the excess absorption ( table [ tab.params ] ) is not an obvious prediction of the model .",
    "( note , however , that related models of isothermal cooling flows can produce material that would give rise to excess absorption  pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) .",
    "another success of the two - temperature model of brighenti & mathews also highlights a possible problem with the model .",
    "the mass estimated from the stellar dynamics within an effective radius @xmath35 of ngc 4472 is in excellent agreement with the mass inferred from the x - ray data using the two - temperature model . however",
    ", for @xmath36 the mass inferred from the x - ray analysis is less than that indicated by stars .",
    "one explanation for this discrepancy is that magnetic pressure support becomes important at these small radii which must be accounted for in the x - ray analysis . alternatively",
    ", mass drop - out from the cooling flow may need to be considered .",
    "we obtain results for multiphase cooling flow models of the _ asca _ data of the elliptical galaxies quite analogous to clusters ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) .",
    "in particular , excess absorption on the cooling - flow component and galactic absorption on the ambient hot gas is indicated for ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 5044 .",
    "there is a discrepancy between the mass implied by this absorbing material and the amount of cold gas inferred from hi and co observations ( e.g. see bf and fabian 1994 ) .",
    "this is a critical issue for the simple constant - pressure cooling flow model because the inferred absorbing mass is consistent with the mass deposited by the cooling flow over the galaxy lifetime .",
    "it is possible that other versions of multiphase cooling flows would have different predictions for mass deposition .",
    "broad - band spectral fitting of future observations of elliptical galaxies with _ chandra _ will be able to distinguish two - temperature and cooling flow models @xcite . with _",
    "astro - e _ this distinction can be made using only individual k shell emission lines ( particularly of oxygen ) thus alleviating any remaining concerns at that time about the accuracy of plasma codes in the fe l shell energy region .",
    "we have examined the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ spectra of ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , ngc 4636 , and ngc 5044 , which are among the brightest elliptical galaxies in x - rays , to constrain the temperature structure and abundances of the hot gas in these systems .",
    "our principal aim is to determine whether the _ asca _ spectra are adequately described by isothermal models of the hot gas , and whether such isothermal models fit the _ asca _ data as well or better than simple multiphase models .",
    "these `` isothermal '' models actually have two components ( 1t+brem ) consisting of one component of isothermal hot gas ( 1 t ) and another component of thermal bremsstrahlung ( brem ) presumably arising from discrete sources .",
    "to begin we simultaneously fit isothermal models to the 0.55 - 9 kev _",
    "asca _ sis and 1 - 9 kev _ asca",
    "_ gis spectra of each galaxy using the mekal and raymond - smith ( rs ) plasma codes to model the hot gas in each system .",
    "spectrum is extracted from a region of @xmath0 radius because the large energy - dependent psf confuses spatial analysis on scales much smaller than this . as we discuss below , the spatial variation of the x - ray spectra",
    "is examined with the _ rosat _ pspc data .    in terms of the @xmath37 null hypothesis probability",
    "@xmath38 the 1t+brem fits to the _ asca _ data are of formally poor quality for each galaxy if the relative abundances with respect to fe in the hot gas are fixed at their solar values .",
    "if the relative abundances of the @xmath1-process elements ( and others for ngc 5044 and ngc 4636 ) are allowed to vary for each galaxy , the fits are improved but are still very poor for all of the galaxies except ( marginally ) ngc 4636 .",
    "the fe abundances inferred from the isothermal models with variable relative abundances are @xmath39 for ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 5044 consistent with previous studies ; for ngc 4636 a very sub - solar fe abundance is also obtained with the rs code , though @xmath40 is implied for the mekal code when the relative abundances are allowed to deviate substantially from their solar values .",
    "the best isothermal fits require abundances of o , ne , and mg to be very different from fe ; these abundances are usually required to be near zero except , e.g. , for the ne abundances of ngc 5044 and ngc 4636 which require values greater than solar for the mekal code .",
    "ni abundances very different from fe are indicated for ngc 4636 and ngc 5044 .",
    "finally , the marginal fit for the isothermal model of ngc 4636 using the mekal model requires the na abundance to be many times the solar value .",
    "next we examined whether simple multiphase models fit the _ asca _ data better than the isothermal models .",
    "we studied two - temperature models ( 2 t or 2t+brem ) consisting of two components of hot gas and ( if desired ) a bremsstrahlung component ( brem ) for the putative emission from discrete sources .",
    "we also examined a simple multiphase cooling flow where gas cools at constant pressure and drops out of the flow at all radii .",
    "this model ( cf+1 t or cf+1t+brem ) consists of one cooling - flow component ( cf ) , one component of isothermal hot gas ( 1 t ) with temperature tied to the upper temperature of the cf component , and ( if desired ) a bremsstrahlung component ( brem ) .",
    "the two - temperature models provide subtantially better fits to the sis and gis data than the isothermal models . with the exception of ngc 4636 ,",
    "these superior fits are achieved with the relative abundances with respect to fe fixed at their solar values .",
    "the cooling flow models fit nearly as well as the two - temperature models for ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 5044 .",
    "the poor fit of the cooling flow model to ngc 4636 is probably due largely to the limitation in our implementation of the cooling flow model which fixes the relative abundances at their solar values .",
    "the multitemperature fits of ngc 1399 and ngc 4472 are improved significantly when a brem component is added ( 2t+brem ) , though the reduction in @xmath37 is not so large as that observed between the 1t+brem and 2 t cases . for ngc 4636 , in contrast , the addition of the brem component to the 2 t and cf+1 t models provides a much larger improvement to the fit than observed between the 1t+brem and 2 t cases .",
    "the luminosities of these brem components are consistent with expectations of emission from discrete sources .    unlike the isothermal models , the fe abundances predicted by the multiphase models indicate values of @xmath4 - 2 solar .",
    "for example , the 2t+brem models give fe abundances ( 90 per cent confidence ) of @xmath41 for ngc 1399 , @xmath42 for ngc 4472 , @xmath43 for ngc 5044 , and @xmath44 for ngc 4636 .",
    "the multiphase cooling flows also indicate solar fe abundances : @xmath45 for ngc 1399 , @xmath46 for ngc 4472 , @xmath47 for ngc 5044 , and @xmath48 for ngc 4636 .",
    "an abundance gradient is also implied by the cooling flow model of ngc 5044 since the abundance determined for the isothermal component ( @xmath49 ) is considerably less than the cooling flow component .",
    "both the two - temperature and cooling flow models for ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and ngc 5044 predict absorption in excess of the galactic value for the colder gas components in their respective models while galactic absorption is indicated for their hotter components .",
    "this is consistent with the radial variation of column density found in the cores of some cooling flow clusters ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) .",
    "the key constraints from the broad - band spectral fitting arise from the sis data near 1 kev where the fe l shell emission lines dominate .",
    "errors in the plasma codes are also potentially most serious for these fe l lines ( e.g. fabian et al . 1994 ; liedahl et al .",
    "we find , as expected , that the mekal code is much more accurate than rs for the important energies @xmath2 kev , and thus the mekal models should be used in preference to rs especially for elliptical galaxies . by comparing fits using the mekal and rs plasma codes we have determined that remaining errors in the modeling of the fe l lines by these codes are insufficient to qualitatively change our results obtained from the broad - band spectral fitting .",
    "previous studies by hwang et al . and",
    "bf also find that the temperatures and fe abundances inferred for ellipticals using _ asca _ data are not overly sensitive to remaining errors in the plasma codes near 1 kev .",
    "we have measured the emission from the k@xmath1 line blends of the h - like and he - like ions of si and s using a simple model of a bremsstrahlung continuum with zero - width gaussians for the line blends .",
    "these local measurements provide additional constraints independent of the fe l emission on the models obtained from the broad - band spectral fitting .",
    "we find that isothermal models generally under - predict the equivalent widths of the si and s lines of these systems .",
    "the equivalent widths of the multiphase models , in contrast , are much better matches to the _ asca _ data .",
    "the ratios si xiv / si xiii and s xvi / xv are also generally better described by the multiphase models . even for ngc 4636 , which displays the smallest improvement for the two - temperature model over the isothermal model for the broad - band spectral fits ( section [ broad ] ) , the line ratios and equivalent widths of si and s clearly favor the two - temperature model . hence , whereas loewenstein & mushotzky and loewenstein found support for isothermal models of ellipticals using only the si ratio , we find that when both the ratios and equivalent widths of the si and s line blends are considered , the multiphase models are strongly favored .",
    "we examined whether the temperature profiles inferred from the _ rosat _ pspc data of these galaxies can also distinguish between the isothermal and multiphase models obtained from the single - aperture analysis of the _ asca _ data .",
    "dividing up the pspc spectrum for each galaxy into a series of radial bins within the apertures defined for the _ asca _ analysis , we fitted single - temperature mekal models to each bin .",
    "each galaxy has a qualitatively similar temperature gradient which begins with a minimum temperature at the center and rises to a maximum at the final radial bin which overlaps the _ asca _",
    "radius in very good agreement with previous studies of these galaxies ( forman et al .",
    "1993 ; david et al . 1994",
    "; trinchieri et al . 1994 ; rangarajan et al . 1995 ; irwin & sarazin 1996 ; jones et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the temperatures of the central and outer bins agree quite well with the temperatures of the colder and hotter components obtained for the two - temperature and cooling flow models of the _ asca _ data .",
    "the abundances , though uncertain , tend to have values near solar .",
    "finally , the central bins of the pspc data are not satisfactorily described by the isothermal model and instead suggest multiphase temperature components and absorption in excess of the galactic value , especially for ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 .",
    "we also constructed composite _ rosat _ models by summing up the isothermal models for each radial bin within the _ asca _ apertures . for each composite pspc model we simulated an _",
    "sis observation appropriate for each galaxy .",
    "we then fitted isothermal and multiphase models to these simulated sis data analogously to our procedure for the real _ asca _ data .",
    "these composite pspc models are very consistent with the _ asca _ data of ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 and strongly favor multiphase models of the hot gas in these systems .",
    "the peculiar abundances required for the isothermal models of the real _ asca _ data ( table [ tab.params ] ) of all the galaxies also can be produced by forcing a isothermal model to fit the multiphase spectrum generated by the composite pspc models .",
    "although the pspc models suggest the spectral properties of ngc 4636 are quite similar to the other galaxies , strong conclusions can not be drawn from the radially varying isothermal models the pspc data of ngc 4636 and ngc 4472 since they fail to produce the _ asca _ emission above @xmath8 kev .",
    "therefore , our analysis of these systems demonstrates that isothermal models of the _ asca _ data within the @xmath3 apertures are inconsistent with the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ pspc data , a conclusion which can not be attributed to reasonable errors in the mekal plasma code .",
    "simple two - temperature and multiphase cooling flow models can provide good descriptions of these data sets with fe abundances of @xmath4 - 2 solar and ( except for ngc 4636 ) relative abundances fixed at their solar values ( in good agreement with the results of bf ) ; this situation is very analogous to that found for poor galaxy groups in a recent study @xcite .",
    "although the current data do not clearly distinguish between the two - temperature and cooling flow models , data will soon be available from the _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ , and _ astro - e _ satellites which can usefully address this issue ( see section [ 2tvscf ] ) .    in section [ abun ]",
    "we have discussed the implications of the approximately solar fe abundances obtained for the multiphase models .",
    "the stellar abundances averaged over @xmath50 computed by arimoto et al .",
    "imply solar fe abundances in agreement with the multiphase models .",
    "however , preliminary results reported in loewenstein indicate the stellar fe abundances are @xmath31 solar . using this smaller value",
    "we find that the standard chemical enrichment models of the hot gas in ellipticals ( e.g. ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) can reproduce the solar fe abundance in the hot gas to within a factor of two .",
    "( this relatively small discrepancy essentially disappears if we increase the fe abundances we have obtained by a factor of 1.44 to reflect the meteoritic solar abundances instead of the photospheric values we have used  see ishimaru & arimoto . )",
    "solar fe abundances in the hot gas are also consistent with other enrichment models based on homogeneous @xcite and inhomogeneous cooling flows @xcite .",
    "although the ellipticals in our sample are special in that they are among the brightest galaxies in relatively dense environments and have among the largest values of @xmath51 , it is possible the evidence we have obtained for non - isothermal gas in these systems could be the result of their _ asca _ data having perhaps the largest s / n among elliptical galaxies .",
    "if this is the case , the better quality data soon to become available should reveal that the hot gas in other ellipticals ( at least near their centers ) also consists of multiple temperature components with nearly solar fe abundances .",
