    "several feedback mechanisms have been invoked to balance the cooling process in the hot x - ray emitting gas halo of clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "these include gravitational heating , supernovae , subcluster mergers , thermal conduction , and agn - driven outbursts . in rich clusters ,",
    "the radio outbursts from the agn harboured in the central galaxy appear to be the dominant source of heating .",
    "however most of the galaxies and baryonic matter in the universe reside in less massive units , such as poor clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "thus the study of feedback in these environments is fundamental to understand the mechamism by which feedback operates and how it has influenced the formation and thermal history of most of the baryons in the universe .",
    "to investigate the impact of agn feedback in galaxy groups , we are carrying out an in - depth study of a representative collection of 18 galaxy groups ( listed in tab .  1 ) , using low ( and multi ) frequency radio observations , obtained at the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , and deep archival _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray data .",
    "the groups were chosen on the basis of structures , either in the x - ray surface brightness and temperature maps or radio morphology , which strongly indicate interaction between the radio source and the intragroup medium .",
    "all groups , except two , were observed with the gmrt both at 610 mhz and 235 mhz during cycle 12 , 14 and 15 .",
    "the observing period for each frequency is given in tab .  1 .",
    "gmrt observations at 327 mhz and 150 mhz were also obtained for few targets ( see notes to tab .",
    "1 ) as part of the follow - up ongoing at these frequencies . the data from all observations in tab .  1 have been completely reduced .",
    "the sensitivity achieved in the final images is in the range 35 - 100 @xmath0jy at 610 mhz and 0.2 - 1 mjy at 235 mhz for a typical observing time of @xmath12 - 3 hours on source .",
    "the ongoing analysis shows that the sources are diverse , covering a range of spatial scales and total powers , from classic double fr - i to core - halo radio sources ( giacintucci et al . in preparation ) .",
    ".list of galaxy groups and status of the gmrt observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have selected two systems from the above sample - ngc5044 and awm4 - which exhibit different kinds of agn / hot gas interaction , to show how the combination of deep x - ray data and high - sensitivity low frequency radio observations can provide a unique insight into the nature of the feedback mechanism in galaxy groups .",
    "[ [ ngc5044 ] ] * ngc5044 * + + + + + + + + +    the new _ chandra _ observation reveals that the group hosts many small radio quiet cavities , filaments , and a semi - circular cold front ( fig .  1 ; david et al .",
    "the gmrt 610 mhz image ( right ) shows the radio core and a lobe which extends along a filament of cold gas .",
    "the 235 mhz emission ( left ) is much more extended , with little overlap with the 610 mhz image .",
    "the emission fills the s cavity , curves toward the w just behind the cold front , and then sharply bends by @xmath190@xmath2 . a second component , a detached radio lobe , is visible toward the s - e , and its western edge is coincident with the cold front , suggesting that the relativistic material in this structure might have been produced by an earlier outburst and that it is currently compressed by the motion of ngc5044 toward the s - e .",
    "the lack of any detected emission at 610 mhz in the same region as the 235 mhz emission indicates that the radio spectrum must be very steep .",
    "the gmrt data thus appear to reveal 2 ( or possibly 3 ) separate outbursts .",
    "the youngest outburst can be identified with the 610 mhz emission , and the oldest burst with the detached radio lobe .     and 18@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the lowest contour is shown at 3@xmath4=0.75 mjy b@xmath5 and 0.075 mjy b@xmath5 , respectively . ]",
    "; lowest contour at 3@xmath4=0.15 mjy b@xmath5 ) , superposed on the _ chandra _ residual image , after subtraction of the best - fitting surface brightness model . ]",
    "[ [ awm4 ] ] * awm4 * + + + + + +    previous xmm - newton observations showed awm4 to be isothermal at @xmath12.5 kev out to at least 160 kpc from the centre , even though the cooling time in the middle is @xmath1 2 gyr ( osullivan et al .",
    "its powerful central radio galaxy was proposed as the most likely source of heating .",
    "our deep gmrt observations at 235 , 327 and 610 mhz , presented in giacintucci et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , revealed the full extent of the radio source and allowed us to determine its age , orientation , energy and physical parameters .",
    "however , with no indications of x - ray cavities associated with the radio source , the question of the coupling between jets and intra - group gas remained unresolved ( see also gastaldello et al .",
    "our new 80 ksec _",
    "image reveals the small - scale galactic corona surrounding the agn ; the radial temperature and abundance profiles show a clear decrease in the central @xmath12 kpc - radius region ( fig .  2 ; left ) , corresponding to the corona .",
    "the existence of this corona might exlain the long timescale of the outburst , as it fuels the agn but is largely unaffected by the radio jets .",
    "we do not detect clear cavities in the _ chandra _ image associated with the radio lobes .",
    "some weak x - ray features are visible in the residual image obtained after subtraction of the best - fitting surface brightness model , shown in fig .  2 ( right ) with overlaid the gmrt 610 mhz contours .",
    "a faint depression is visible in the region of the eastern lobe , and two channel  like structures appear to be associated with the inner jets .",
    "no cavity is detected in the western lobe .",
    "the detailed analysis of these features and their implications is ongoing ( osullivan et al . in prep . ) .",
    "our ongoing x - ray / gmrt study of the agn feedback in galaxy groups shows that low frequency observations play a crucial role in the estimate of the total radio energy input from the central agn and are important in the study of the history of the energy injection and transfer , since they can reveal old , steep - spectrum radio emission and structures related to previous agn outbursts ( e.g. , ngc5044 ) . as shown by our analysis of awm4 ,",
    "the combination of the low frequency information with deep and high resolution x - ray data offers a unique tool to investigate the agn / hot gas interaction ( see also gitti et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "this is of fundamental importance to determine the thermal history of the intragroup and intracluster medium and shed light on the role of the agn feedback on the formation and evolution of galaxies in these environments .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt for their help during the observations .",
    "gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
