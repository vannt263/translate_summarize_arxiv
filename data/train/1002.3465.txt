    "thirty years on , this tool has been applied to galaxies in clusters , groups and the general field , from the local to the high - z universe , to study the systematic variations of galaxy morphologies , colors , current star formation activity , stellar masses and other galaxy properties with environment ( postman & geller 1984 , dressler et al .",

    "in contrast , little attention has so far been devoted to _ how and why density conditions change with redshift_. observationally , density distributions in clusters at different redshifts have never been compared . in the field , an overdensity is usually measured , factoring out the evolution of the mean density of the universe , and the evolution of the distribution of environmental conditions beyond that has never been investigated .",

    ", we considered all galaxies within 2 @xmath1 radii from the central galaxy to compute the projected velocity dispersion along the x , y , and z axes using the same bi - weight estimator that was used for the ediscs clusters , and used the mean of these projected velocity dispersions as the velocity dispersion of the system .",
    "in this section we describe the basic ingredients of our study , and the nomenclature adopted throughout the paper .    for simplicity , in the following we will refer to all galaxy systems of any @xmath4 and mass as `` clusters '' , because the distinction between clusters and groups is irrelevant in this paper .",
    "our analysis is performed within @xmath1 , defined as the radius delimiting a sphere with interior mean density 200 times the critical density .",
    "@xmath1 is often assumed to be approximately equal to the cluster virial radius , since the radius corresponding to a mean interior overdensity of @xmath28 has been shown by n - body simulations to `` accurately demarcate the virialized region of the dm halo , which is in approximate dynamical equilibrium , from the exterior , where material is still falling in '' ( cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "since most observational studies use @xmath1 to compare galaxy properties in clusters at different redshifts , or in clusters and groups of different masses , we use @xmath1 to investigate how the density felt by those galaxies that are usually compared observationally changes with redshift and halo mass .    assuming the virial theorem is valid , from the evolution of the critical density with redshift",

    "observed cluster masses are therefore virialized total masses based on observed velocity dispersions derived from spectroscopy . for ediscs ,",

    "in the following , we refer to an output value of the simulations either as a `` simulated '' or a `` sim - observed '' quantity :     a _ sim - observed _ quantity ( number of galaxies , velocity dispersion , projected local density etc . )",
    "is computed from the simulation with the same method that would be used _",
    "observationally_. for example , the sim - observed number of members within @xmath1 is the number _ in projection _ on the xy plane within @xmath1 ( derived from the velocity dispersion using eqn.(1 ) ) and with a velocity along the z axis within 3@xmath4 from the cluster velocity .",
    "no attempt is made to reproduce the cluster selection strategy adopted by ediscs , nor the geometrical constraints in constructing the masks etc .",
    " a _ simulated _ quantity gives the `` true '' value provided by the simulation .",
    "in the example above , this would be the actual number of galaxies inside the sphere defined by the halo @xmath26 radius .",
    "the difference between simulated and sim - observed quantities is fundamental , as we will show in the paper .",
    "obviously , only sim - observed quantities can be directly compared with observations , but simulated quantities are very useful to address projection issues and other possible observational biases .      all densities in this paper are computed using _ proper _ ( not comoving ) quantities , i.e. proper areas and volumes , in @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that , in order to study the dependence of galaxy properties on the density of the local environment , what matters are gravitational and vicinity effects , and therefore proper distances between galaxies .",

    "sim - observed projected local densities are computed for each galaxy `` member '' ( sim - observed member ) of a simulated cluster as for observations : we consider as members all galaxies brighter than a limit @xmath33 ( either -20 or -19.4 , see below ) within a projected radius @xmath1 from the `` bcg '' ( the central galaxy of the halo ) and within 3@xmath4 in velocity from the mean cluster velocity .",
    "the projected local density @xmath34 ( gal/@xmath35 ) is calculated from the ratio @xmath3/area where area is the circular area encompassing the @xmath3 projected closest neighbours brighter than @xmath33 in the xy ( `` sky '' ) plane , with @xmath36 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the `` physical '' local density @xmath37 ( gal/@xmath38 ) is meant to measure the 3d number density of a region around each galaxy .",

    "the 10 closest neighbours to each galaxy are those with the 10 smallest values of distance @xmath39 from the galaxy , where @xmath40 are the distances along each axis in the simulation .    when computing the densities from the simulation , all neighbours above the magnitude cut were considered , also if outside @xmath26 , to avoid edge effects at the radius @xmath26 , similarly to what was done observationally .",
    "observationally , the projected local density distribution in low - z clusters is shifted towards lower values compared to clusters of similar masses at higher redshift .",

    "the evolution of the observed density distribution , its origin and consequences have not been discussed in the past . it may be argued that this effect could be due to density measurements at high - z suffering from a higher contamination of interlopers , that can artificially inflate the observed densities , but we will show this is not the case .    in order to understand the significance of the density evolution , we investigate how the observed 2d projected density distribution at different redshifts is related to the physical 3d density distribution in the simulation , and how both are expected to change with redshift in clusters .",
    "observations and simulations are compared in fig .",
    "[ uffa555 ] for galaxies brighter than @xmath41 . only haloes with @xmath42 are used in this comparison , to match the masses of ediscs and sdss clusters that dominate the observed density distribution .",
    "the observed projected density distribution ( red histograms ) shifts by about 0.4dex from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , corresponding to a decrease by a factor @xmath43 .",
    "sim - observed projected densities evolve by the same amount ( black histograms ) , and they follow rather well the observed projected density distributions both at high- and low - z .",
    "the corresponding 3d physical densities computed from the simulation are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ uffa55 ] .",
    "the evolution of the physical 3d densities is even stronger than that of the 2d distribution .",
    "physical densities for @xmath27 were on average higher by 0.5 dex , that is a factor @xmath44 , in distant clusters than today .",
    "therefore , the evolution in projected density is not merely a projection effect with @xmath45 , but corresponds to physically evolving conditions in 3d galaxy number density .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , when accounting for the average observed shift and rescaling to the same number of galaxies , the 2d and 3d density distributions at @xmath22 closely match the respective distributions at @xmath21 ( see dashed histograms in fig .",
    "[ uffa55 ] ) . after number rescaling",
    ", the high - z distribution can be obtained with good approximation from the low - z histogram simply multiplying each density by a factor @xmath44 in 3d , and 2.5 in 2d , since the shape of the distribution does not change .",
    "importantly , we find that both the 2d and the 3d density distributions do not vary strongly with cluster mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 4masses ] . , the radius whose interior mean density is equal to 500 times the critical density . ]",
    "the @xmath36 neighbours physical density distribution are rather similar at all halo masses above @xmath46 ( top panels ) , covering the same range of densities .",
    "the binned distributions shown in fig .  [ 4masses ] do not overlap with each other for always less than 12% of the galaxies . at lower halo masses , @xmath47 ,",
    "corresponding to the lowest mass groups in ediscs , using @xmath36 is inappropriate because the number of luminous members is less than 10 for many systems . using densities computed for @xmath48 ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ 4masses ] ) , the density distributions remain rather similar to those of more massive clusters .",
    "galaxies in haloes with masses @xmath49 cover the same density range of galaxies in more massive haloes , and the 3d density distributions do not overlap in less than 15% of the galaxies . remarkably , this means that the distributions of local densities to the 3 closest neighbours are quite similar for galaxies in clusters over two orders of magnitude in mass , suggesting that there is an approximately equal distribution of dense and less dense regions from groups to massive clusters when the `` really local '' density is considered .",
    "the intuitive belief that more massive clusters are denser environments proves to be wrong .",
    "actually , we see that the lowest halo mass bin has the largest 3d high - density tail .    so far we have used a fixed @xmath27 galaxy magnitude limit at both redshifts , but it is physically more meaningful to adopt an @xmath33 limit evolving with redshift , taking into account the fact that a galaxy luminosity evolves as the galaxy stars become older .",
    "we consider passive evolution , that is the evolution of an integrated spectrum due to simple aging of old stellar populations , without the addition of any new star . using van dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) or , equivalently , fritz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) spectrophometric models for a single episode of star formation occurred at @xmath45 between 1.5 and 3 for a salpeter imf and solar metallicity , the evolution of @xmath33 between @xmath21 and @xmath50 is 0.5 - 0.7mag . between @xmath51 and @xmath22 .",
    "if we arbitrarily assume the uncertainty to be the same in @xmath52 and in @xmath53 , the change in luminosity over our redshift range due to the imf is still much smaller than that obtained lowering the star formation redshift to e.g. @xmath51 . thus , the uncertainty in the passively evolving magnitude limit is dominated by the assumption in the formation redshift of most stars .",
    "the great majority of cluster galaxies have very old mass - weighted stellar ages ( e.g. fritz et al . 2010 , in prep . )",
    "therefore a high formation redshift range as the one adopted here is appropriate . ]",
    "therefore , we consider an evolving magnitude limit going from @xmath27 at @xmath21 to @xmath54 at @xmath22 .",
    "passive evolution produces a stronger decreasing luminosity evolution than any other star formation history .",
    "therefore , assuming a passively evolving magnitude limit , we are sure to include in the density calculation at @xmath22 all galaxies that would be included at @xmath21 , and possibly some more galaxies that do not make it into the sample at @xmath21 .",
    "this yields a sort of lower limit on ( but is probably close to ) the evolution of the density distribution as it would be measured using a fixed galaxy stellar mass limit and if galaxy masses did not evolve significantly . on the contrary ,",
    "the non - evolving @xmath27 used above excludes from the low - z density calculation all those galaxies that have faded below the limit by @xmath22 but were included at @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , it provides an upper limit for the evolution of the density distribution for a mass - limited galaxy sample with non - evolving galaxy masses .",
    "unfortunately , the sdss spectroscopy is not deep enough to reach @xmath54 in our sdss clusters . adopting a brighter , passively evolving limit at both redshifts would result in too few galaxies in high - z clusters to allow a robust density determination .",
    "hence , we are forced to investigate the passive evolution case only in the simulation , mimicking the way a sufficiently deep observational survey at low - z would be treated to compare with the high - z results .",
    "the fact that the observed @xmath55 density distributions are well reproduced in the simulation , as is the number of cluster members shown in the next section , makes us confident that the simulated densities should be reliable also down to 0.5 magnitude fainter .    with a passively evolving galaxy magnitude limit ,",
    "the shifts of the 2d and 3d density distributions in the simulation are smaller , but still conspicuous ( fig .",
    "[ uffa55bis ] ) . after number rescaling",
    ", the high - z 3d and 2d density distributions match the @xmath22 distributions if densities decrease by a factor @xmath56 ( 0.25dex ) in 3d and 1.6 ( 0.2dex ) in 2d .",
    "the analysis of the simulations presented so far demonstrates that , within @xmath1 and computing local densities from the 10 or 3 closest neighbours , a ) distant clusters were denser environments than low - z clusters , in the sense that , at @xmath21 , cluster galaxies had on average @xmath57 times ( @xmath58dex , @xmath59dex ) more luminous / massive neighbors than at @xmath22 , and b ) the distribution of physical densities is rather similar in haloes over two orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "in the analysis presented above , densities represent _ number densities _ of galaxies , that means number of neighbours of an individual galaxy down to a certain magnitude , per unit of projected area or volume . in the following we want to establish    *",
    "how the evolution in number density of individual galaxies corresponds to the evolution of the _ global average number density _ over the whole cluster ( total number of members per unit volume @xmath0 ) . in doing this ,",
    "we investigate separately the evolution of @xmath60 within @xmath1 and the evolution of the volume @xmath52 enclosed by @xmath1 .",
    "the question we wish to address is how the change of the 3d number density with redshift is related to the evolution of @xmath0 , and @xmath60 and @xmath52 separately , and how and why these evolve .",
    "note that @xmath0 can be estimated observationally , by estimating a cluster radius from either @xmath4 or an alternative mass measurement , and counting the number of members within this radius .",
    "* how the _ number _ density evolution is related to the mean _ matter _ density evolution in clusters , that is the evolution of the mean total , or dm , mass per unit volume . in principle , mass density and number density are different measurements of environment , and are expected to influence physical processes in different ways : for example , number density is more relevant for galaxy - galaxy interactions and mergers , while mass density is more relevant for other effects , such as the cluster tidal field .",
    "we wish to understand if number densities and mass densities evolve in similar or different ways , to gain a more complete picture of the evolution of environmental conditions .",
    "the number of galaxies per cluster observed in the ediscs and sloan datasets within @xmath1 is shown as a function of the observed velocity dispersion in fig .",
    "[ vssigma ] .",
    "this is compared at each redshift with the sim - observed number of galaxies as a function of sim - observed velocity dispersion . from fig .",
    "[ vssigma ] , it can be seen that the sim - observed numbers agree quite well with the observed numbers at both redshifts , although the sim - observed numbers at @xmath22 tend to be slightly higher than the observed values by about 0.1dex .",
    "the number of galaxies increases with velocity dispersion at both redshifts ( higher velocity dispersion clusters have more members , obviously ) . for a fixed @xmath41 limit , the number of members decreases from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( the number of galaxies down to a fixed magnitude limit in a cluster of a given @xmath4 was higher in the past ) , as shown by the offset in the right panel between the high - z best - fit line and the @xmath22 points .    since clusters with the same observed velocity dispersion but different redshift have different masses ( cf .",
    " 4 ) , we remove this effect by plotting the number of galaxies versus cluster mass in fig .",
    "[ vsmass ] , see bottom panels .",
    "the trends remain similar : both observationally and theoretically , the number of galaxies increases linearly with mass in a log - log plot , and , for a fixed galaxy magnitude limit , it decreases towards lower redshift .",
    "to understand if the number decline at lower redshift is simply due to galaxies dropping off the sample at @xmath22 because they fade below the fixed magnitude cut , in fig .",
    "[ vssigma ] and fig .",
    "[ vsmass ] we also show the sim - observed number of cluster members for a passively evolving magnitude limit @xmath63 at @xmath22 ( blue points ) . as explained in  5 , we can not do the same observationally , because the sdss spectroscopy is not deep enough . with the passively evolving limit , the numbers at @xmath22 in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ vsmass ] are only 0.057dex lower than the best fit @xmath21 correlation shown by the solid line ( @xmath64 ) ) .",
    "as we will discuss later in this section , this residual small mismatch is caused by the way masses are derived , and the effect disappears when `` true '' simulated masses of haloes are considered ( top right panel in fig .  [ vsmass ] ) .    to conclude , both observations and simulations show a mild evolution in the @xmath60 vs @xmath65 relation with redshift for a fixed magnitude limit .",
    "when passive evolution is taken into account , the number of members in a cluster of a given mass does not evolve between @xmath66 and @xmath22 .",
    "a similar result was found by lin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who , based on cluster mass estimates derived from the x - ray temperature and observed number counts , concluded that for passive evolution the @xmath67 relation shows no sign of evolution out to @xmath68 .",
    "this result implies that the evolution in the number density distributions for the passive evolution case in cluster samples with the same cluster mass distribution at different redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ uffa55bis ] ) is not due to a higher number of members at @xmath21 , but must originate mostly from the `` expanded size '' of local clusters compared to distant ones , that is , to the evolution of the cluster volume .      at this point",
    "it is useful to recall some textbook knowledge about how and why the volume and the mean matter density of clusters evolve , and how this evolution simply stems from using @xmath1 to define both of them .",
    "due to the expansion of the universe , a unit volume today corresponds to a volume smaller by a factor @xmath69 at redshift @xmath45 ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , the physical 3d density ( number of galaxies per unit volume ) of non - evolving objects locked into the hubble flow changes with redshift as @xmath70 . galaxies and clusters of galaxies , however , are far from being unevolving objects , with clusters accreting new galaxies and groups .",
    "moreover , collapsed structures such as clusters should have broken off from the hubble flow , at a time when their density exceeded a fixed multiple of the critical density at that redshift ( peebles 1993 , cole & lacey 1996 ) .    since we only include galaxies within the cluster @xmath1 , _ by definition _ the mean _ matter _ density within this radius is 200 times the critical density at that redshift .",
    "the critical density evolves with @xmath45 as :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the gravitational constant @xmath73 .    as a consequence , the mean matter density (= mass per unit volume ) in clusters of _ any mass _ , within a radius @xmath74 goes as :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 in our cosmology .",
    "this means that _ the mean matter density in clusters at a given redshift is the same for all clusters_. moreover , it means that _ the mean matter density evolves in the same way for clusters of all masses _ , by a factor @xmath78 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this has a number of implications , all consequences of using @xmath1 as the radius delimiting the cluster , among which :    * the mean matter density within a cluster @xmath1 at any redshift can be computed from eqn.(3 ) : the most distant cluster at @xmath79 has a density @xmath81 times higher than a cluster at @xmath80 . in our case",
    ", any cluster at @xmath21 ( of any mass ) has a matter density @xmath82 , and any cluster at @xmath22 has @xmath83 , a factor of 1.774 less dense .",

    "the constancy of the average _ mass _ density with cluster mass , and its evolution with redshift , is simply a consequence of the evolution of the critical density and of considering as `` cluster '' only the region within @xmath1 which approximates the sphere of influence of cluster gravity against the hubble flow .",

    "based on the 3d density distributions obtained from the simulations , we find that this is due to high - z clusters being denser , in physical space , than their local counterparts .",
    "galaxies in distant clusters are therefore on average closer to each other than galaxies in local clusters .",
    "\\2 ) the shift to higher individual galaxy number densities at higher redshifts is consistent with the globally higher number of galaxies per unit volume on the cluster scale that we obtain from the way the cluster region is defined and from the simulation results .",

    "\\3 ) we find that the global number density @xmath0 evolves because of the combination of two effects : the dm mass per unit volume ( the mass density ) increases at higher redshift , simply because the cluster @xmath1 radius is defined to enclose a density that is 200 times the critical density , while simulations show that the average number of galaxies per unit of dm mass @xmath92 is constant both with redshift and cluster mass , being always @xmath112 counting only galaxies brighter than a passively evolving @xmath113 at @xmath22 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath92 is found when considering the dm halo mass , but does not persist when using sim - observed masses derived from the velocity dispersion as it is done observationally , because the latter strongly underestimate the system mass at low masses , and slightly overestimate it at high masses . in the case of sim - observed masses derived from velocity dispersions ,",
    "simulations show a decline of @xmath92 with mass , in agreement with the observed relations both at high- and low - z .",
    "\\4 ) from the previous point , it stems that both the mass density and the global number density evolve as the critical density and do not depend on cluster mass , therefore they are the same for clusters of all masses , at a given redshift .",
    "moreover , the distribution of physical number densities obtained from the simulations does not vary strongly with cluster mass .",
    "hence , contrary to the most intuitive belief of more massive systems being denser , mentioned in many observational studies , the most massive and the least massive clusters or groups are on average equally dense , at a given redshift .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that these conclusions apply to _ virialized regions _ and for the density estimators adopted in this paper , that is for a method using the 10 ( and , we have verified , also 3 ) closest neighbours .",
    "these conclusions can not be blindly applied to other types of density estimates that probe physically different scales , nor can be expected to hold in unvirialized regions of the universe . for example , the observed shift in 3d densities with redshift can not simply be assumed to be valid also when density is measured as number counts within a 8 mpc sphere or a 2mpc@xmath1142mpc@xmath114500@xmath115 cylinder in a general field survey .",
    "moreover , we note that in principle these results may depend on the semi - analytic model employed , but this can only be ascertained repeating the analysis with other models .",
    "our results highlights two main aspects :    \\a ) the strong evolution in the average density conditions experienced by galaxies in clusters .",
    "more distant systems are much denser environments , both in number and in dm ( @xmath2 total)mass .",
    "\\b ) the impressive homogeneity in the density of clusters regardless of mass , at a given redshift . not only",
    "the dm mass density , but also the average number density of galaxies and , approximately , the distribution of physical number densities are the same in the virialized regions of clusters and groups of any mass , at a given redshift .",
