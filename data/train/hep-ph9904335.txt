    "the lepton flavor violating process of neutrinoless muon - to - electron ( @xmath9 ) conversion in a nucleus , represented by @xmath10 is an exotic process very sensitive to a plethora of new - physics extensions of the standard model(sm ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , experimentally it is accessible with incomparable sensitivity .",
    "long time ago marciano and sanda @xcite has proposed it as one of the best probes to search for lepton flavor violation beyond the standard model .",
    "recently , in view of the indications for neutrino oscillations in super - kamiokande , solar neutrino and lsnd data , new hope has revived among the experimentalists of nuclear and particle physics to detect other signals for physics beyond the sm .",
    "a prominent probe in this spirit is this exotic process ( 1 ) .",
    "the fact that the upper limits on the branching ratio of the @xmath0 conversion relative to the ordinary muon capture , @xmath11 offer the lowest constraints compared to any purely leptonic rare process motivated a new @xmath0 conversion experiment , the so called meco experiment at brookhaven @xcite , which got recently scientific approval and is planned to start soon .",
    "the meco experiment is going to use a new very intense @xmath12 beam and a new detector operating at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) .",
    "the basic feature of this experiment is the use of a pulsed @xmath12 beam to significantly reduce the prompt background from @xmath13 and @xmath14 contaminations . for technical reasons",
    "the meco target has been chosen to be the light nucleus @xmath3al .",
    "traditionally the @xmath15 conversion process was searched by employing medium heavy ( like @xmath1ti and @xmath16cu ) @xcite or very heavy ( like @xmath2pb and @xmath17au ) @xcite targets ( for a historical review on such experiments see ref .",
    "the best upper limits on @xmath18 set up to the present have been extracted at psi by the sindrum ii experiments resulting in the values @xmath19 ( at 90% confidence level ) .",
    "the experimental sensitivity of the brookhaven experiment is expected to be roughly @xmath20 i.e. three to four orders of magnitude below the existing experimental limits .",
    "it is well known that the process ( 1 ) is a very good example of the interplay between particle and nuclear physics attracting significant efforts from both sides .",
    "the underlying nuclear physics of the @xmath9 conversion has been comprehensively studied in refs .",
    "> from the particle physics point of view , processes like @xmath9 conversion , is forbidden in the sm by muon and electron quantum number conservation . therefore it has long been recognized as an important probe of the flavor changing neutral currents and possible physics beyond the sm @xcite-@xcite .    on the particle physics side",
    "there are many mechanisms of the @xmath9 conversion constructed in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these mechanisms fall into two different categories : photonic and non - photonic .",
    "mechanisms from different categories significantly differ from the point of view of the nucleon and nuclear structure calculations .",
    "this stems from the fact that they proceed at different distances and , therefore , involve different details of the structure .",
    "the long - distance photonic mechanisms are mediated by the photon exchange between the quark and the @xmath9-lepton currents .",
    "these mechanisms resort to the lepton - flavor non - diagonal electromagnetic vertex which is presumably induced by the non - standard model physics at the loop level .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath9 conversion via virtual photon exchange exist in all models which allow @xmath21 decay .",
    "the short - distance non - photonic mechanisms contain heavy particles in intermediate states and can be realized at the tree level , at the 1-loop level or at the level of box diagrams .",
    "the non - photonic mechanisms are mediated by various particles in intermediate states such as @xmath22-bosons @xcite-@xcite , higgs bosons @xcite , supersymmetric particles ( squarks , sleptons , gauginos , higgsinos etc . ) with and without @xmath23-parity conservation in the vertices .    in the supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "extensions of the sm with conserved r - parity ( @xmath24susy ) @xmath0 conversion has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the susy contributions appear only at the loop or box level and , therefore , they are suppressed by the loop factor .",
    "the situation is different in the susy models with r - parity non - conservation ( susy ) . in this framework there",
    "exist the tree level non - photonic contributions @xcite and the 1-loop photonic contributions significantly enhanced by the large logarithms @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of this work is to offer a theoretical background for the running and planned @xmath9 conversion experiments .",
    "we consider all the possible tree level contributions to @xmath9 conversion in the framework of the minimal susy model with most general form of r - parity violation ( mssm ) including the trilinear couplings and the bilinear lepton - higgs terms .",
    "we also examine some non - susy and @xmath24susy mechanisms previously studied in @xcite .",
    "we develop a formalism of calculating the @xmath9 conversion rate for the quark level lagrangian with all these terms .    in our study",
    "we pay special attention to the effect of nucleon and nuclear structure dependence of the @xmath25 conversion branching ratio @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , we take into account the contribution of the strange nucleon sea which , as we will see , gives a contribution comparable to the contribution of the valence quarks of a nucleon .",
    "thus , we apply our formalism to the case of nuclei @xmath26 and @xmath27 by calculating numerically the muon - nucleus overlap integral and solving the dirac equations with modern neural networks techniques and using the psi experimental data .",
    "a similar application is done for the @xmath3al target by employing the sensitivity of the designed meco experiment .",
    "our final goal is to derive on this theoretical basis the experimental constraints on the @xmath28 yukawa couplings , the lepton - higgs mixing parameters and on the sneutrino vevs . towards this end",
    "we use the experimental upper limits on the branching ratio @xmath18 given above and derive the new stringent constraints on the r - parity violating parameters .",
    "it is well known that , the lepton flavors @xmath29 and the total baryon @xmath30 number are conserved by the standard model interactions in all orders of perturbation theory . as mentioned above",
    ", this is an accidental consequence of the sm field content and gauge invariance .",
    "thus @xmath9 conversion is forbidden in the sm .",
    "in contrast to @xmath31 the individual quark flavors @xmath32 are not conserved in the sm by the charged current interactions due to the presence of non - trivial cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "@xmath31 are conserved since the analogous mixing matrix can be rotated away by the neutrino fields redefinition .",
    "the latter is possible while the neutrino fields have no mass term and , therefore , are defined up to an arbitrary unitary rotation .",
    "as soon as the model is extended by inclusion of the right - handed neutrinos lepton flavor violation can occur since neutrinos may acquire a non - trivial mass matrix .    in the supersymmetric extensions of sm @xmath31 and @xmath33 conservation laws are in general",
    "violated . as a result",
    "potentially dangerous total lepton ( ) and baryon ( ) number violating processes become open .    one may easily eliminate and interactions from a susy model by introducing a discrete symmetry known as r - parity .",
    "this is a multiplicative @xmath34 symmetry defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spin quantum number . in this framework neutrinos",
    "are massless .",
    "however the flavor violation in the lepton sector can occur at the 1-loop level via the @xmath31-violation in the slepton sector .",
    "thus , @xmath0 conversion is allowed in the susy models with r - parity conservation .",
    "there is no as yet convincing theoretical motivation for r - symmetry of the low energy lagrangian and , therefore , susy models with ( @xmath24susy ) and without ( @xmath37 susy ) r - parity conservation are `` a priori '' both plausible .",
    "despite the above mentioned problems with , interactions @xmath37 susy looks rather attractive , since it may offer a clue to the solution of some long standing problems of particle physics , such as neutrino mass problem . in the susy framework",
    "neutrinos acquire majorana masses at the weak - scale via mixing with the gauginos and higgsinos as well as via loop effects @xcite . furthermore , susy models admit non - trivial contributions to the lepton flavor violating processes . during the last few years",
    "the susy models have been extensively studied in the literature ( for a recent review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we analyze possible mechanisms for process ( 1 ) existing at the tree level in the minimal susy model with a most general form of r - parity violation .",
    "a most general gauge invariant form of the r - parity violating part of the superpotential at the level of renormalizable operators reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 stand for lepton and quark doublet left - handed superfields while @xmath41 for lepton and _ up _ , _ down _ quark singlet superfields ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the higgs doublet superfields with a weak hypercharge @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "5,6 we list the upper bounds on the products of the trilinear couplings which we obtained from the experimental limit on @xmath9 conversion in @xmath1ti and from the expected experimental sensitivity of meco detector using @xmath3al as a target material .",
    "the corresponding constraints for @xmath27 are significantly weaker and not presented here . in tables",
    "5,6 the quantity @xmath33 denotes a scaling factor defined as @xmath208 which can be used for reconstructing the limits on the listed products of the parameters corresponding to the other experimental upper limits on the branching ratio @xmath209 . in the 2nd column of tables 5,6",
    "we present previous limits existing in the literature and taken from @xcite .",
    "as seen from tables 5,6 the @xmath9-conversion limits on the products @xmath210 and @xmath211 , except only @xmath212 and @xmath213 , are significantly more stringent than those previously known in the literature .",
    "the two products @xmath210 and @xmath211 are less stringently constrained by the present experimental data on @xmath1ti within the tree level non - photonic mechanism .",
    "note that the corresponding previous constraints on these products ( 2nd column of table 5 ) were obtained from the photonic 1-loop mechanism @xcite of @xmath0 conversion which are better than existing in the literature non-@xmath148 constraints on @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the products in table 6 are not constrained by this mechanism @xcite .",
    "however it constrains the products @xmath214 not constrained by the tree level susy mechanism . at present",
    "the @xmath104 constraints on @xmath214 within the 1-loop susy mechanism are weaker than those derived from the other processes .",
    "as we have mentioned at the beginning , significant improvement on these @xmath148 limits is expected from the ongoing experiments at psi @xcite and even better from the meco experiment at brookhaven @xcite .",
    "this would make the @xmath9 conversion constraints on all the products of the trilinear coupling attainable in the @xmath9 conversion at the tree and at the 1-loop levels better than those from the other processes in all the cases .",
    "note that the last four limits for @xmath215 in table 6 originate from the contribution of the strange nucleon sea .",
    "these limits are comparable to the other @xmath148 constraints derived from the valence quarks contributions .",
    "finally we put constraints on the products of the bilinear parameters evaluated from the @xmath9 conversion in @xmath216ti as @xmath217 where @xmath33 is a scaling factor defined in eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "these constraints are weaker than those derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data .    the limits in tables 5,6 and in eq .",
    "( [ bilin ] ) were extracted under the following assumptions .",
    "we assumed that all the scalar masses in eq .",
    "( [ coeff12 ] ) are equal @xmath218 and also that there is no significant compensation between the different terms contributing to the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "note that the last assumption is , in practice , equivalent to the other well known assumptions about the dominance of only one parameter or product of the parameters at a time .",
    "these assumptions are widely used in the literature for derivation of constraints on the r - parity violating parameters .    instead of considering only one specific combination of @xmath219 and @xmath220 as dominant , one may attempt to consider all combinations of the r - parity violating couplings . to this end",
    "one needs constraints on the relative magnitudes of the r - parity violating couplings .",
    "this can be accomplished in a fashion analogous to the theory of textures for the yukawa couplings .",
    "this theory , which expresses the entries of the down fermion mass matrix in powers of a parameter @xmath221 , has been successful in describing the charged fermion mass matrices ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this can be extended to the r - parity violation couplings themselves @xcite .",
    "in fact using solution b of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath222 this way , @xmath15 conversion can be used to constrain the overall scale of the r - parity violating interaction using phonomenologically acceptable textures @xcite .",
    "the transition matrix elements of the flavor violating @xmath223 conversion are of notable importance in computing accurately the corresponding rates for each accessible channel of this exotic process .",
    "such calculations provide useful nuclear - physics inputs for the expected new data from the psi and meco experiments to put more severe bounds on the muon - number violating parameters determining the effective currents in various models that predict the exotic @xmath104 process .",
    "we developed a systematic approach which allows one to calculate the @xmath0 conversion rate in terms of the quark level lagrangian of any elementary model taking into account the effect of the nucleon and nuclear structure .",
    "our conversion rate formula ( [ rme ] ) is valid for the interactions with the ( axial-)vector and ( pseudo-)scalar quark and lepton currents , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ nucl1 ] ) . in the previous @xmath148 calculations found in the literature",
    "only the ( axial-)vector currents were considered .    in the case of the r - parity violating interactions discussed here",
    "we have investigated all the possible tree level contributions to the @xmath9 conversion in nuclei .",
    "we found new important contribution to @xmath0 conversion originating from the strange quark sea in the nucleon which is comparable with the usual contribution of the valence @xmath224 quarks .",
    "we introduced the quantities @xmath169 and @xmath152 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ rme.1 ] ) which can be associated with theoretical sensitivities of a @xmath0 conversion experiment to the charged lepton flavor violating interactions discussed in the present paper .",
    "these quantities are independent of a target material and , therefore , might be helpful for comparison of searching potentials of different @xmath9 conversion experiments and for planning future experiments .",
    "> from the existing data on @xmath18 in @xmath1ti and @xmath2pb and the expected sensitivity of the designed meco experiment @xcite we obtained stringent upper limits on the quantities @xmath169 and @xmath152 .",
    "then we extracted the limits on the products of the trilinear parameters of the type @xmath211 , @xmath210 which are significantly more severe than those existing in the literature .",
    "let us conclude with the following important remark . as was observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , if the ongoing experiments at psi @xcite and brookhaven @xcite will have reached the quoted sensitivities in the branching ratio @xmath18 then the @xmath148 constraints on all the products of the parameters @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath210 measurable in @xmath9 conversion will become more stringent than those from any other processes .",
    "this is especially important since no comparable improvements of the other experiments probing these couplings is expected in the near future .",
