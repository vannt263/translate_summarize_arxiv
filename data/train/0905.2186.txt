    "observations of neutral hydrogen around the milky way ( mw ) have revealed that our galaxy is surrounded by a large number of cold gaseous clouds . owing to their high velocities compared to galactic rotation",
    ", it was proposed that these objects reside outside the disk @xcite , and they became known as high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "the masses of most hvcs are uncertain because of their uncertain distances ( several hvc complexes are now placed at @xmath0 @xcite ) , but are estimated to be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "similar hi clouds and cloud complexes have been found around other galaxies ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the overall kinematics of hvcs implies net inflow , motivating a picture where hvcs represent the building blocks of our galaxy @xcite and provide the supply of gas needed for its relatively high star formation rate .",
    "in fact , our galaxy has been forming stars at a steady rate for the last several gyrs @xcite , implying that the gas consumed must be continuously replenished .",
    "many hvcs can be ionized by the external uv field , so hi observations likely detect only the densest of these structures that are able to self - shield .",
    "the presence of clouds around other galaxies is also implied by absorption line studies at both low and intermediate redshifts @xcite , which typically find gaseous clouds to distances of several tens of kiloparsecs in a halo .",
    "it is likely that these absorbing clouds are analogs to the local hvc population @xcite .    despite numerous theories ,",
    "the origin of these clouds remains uncertain .",
    "proposed mechanisms fall into the following three classes : 1 : cooling instabilities in the hot medium @xcite that can interact with the hot halo gas resulting in net infall onto the milky way @xcite .",
    "2 : production by a `` galactic fountain '' where outflows driven by supernovae from the disk condense in the hot corona and fall back onto the mw @xcite , possibly entraining hot gas from the halo @xcite .",
    "3 : interaction of hot halo gas with infalling satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to account for clouds with specific properties ; e.g. those in the magellanic cloud system . in principle , all of these channels could operate , complicating modeling and data interpretation . here , we concentrate on cloud formation from cooling and hydrodynamical instabilities in infalling gas .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have shown that at high redshift the bulk of the gas supplied to galaxies is accreted from the intergalactic medium through filaments in a `` cold mode '' @xcite even after a hot halo atmosphere develops .",
    "owing to lower densities , at late times there is a shift in the physics that governs the accretion , where filamentary flows get disrupted in the central parts of massive halos .",
    "we examine this late - time accretion and show that these disrupted filaments are still able to supply cold gas to mw size galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate that accretion through filaments creates density inversions in halos , triggering a combination of cooling and rayleigh - taylor ( rt hereafter ) instabilities that produce clouds , supplying mw like galaxies with gas .",
    "earlier work hinted that the `` leftovers '' from filamentary might contribute to cloud formation @xcite but did not demonstrate why and how this process operates .",
    "we use the gadget-2 smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code @xcite which simultaneously conserves energy and entropy , preventing numerical phase mixing .",
    "this is potentially an important property for modeling cloud formation as many sph implementations can mix cold , dense and hot , dilute phases @xcite .",
    "gravitational forces are calculated combining particle mesh and hierarchical tree algorithms . in order to capture the formation of @xmath2 clouds at high spatial resolution in a large volume",
    ", we adopt a zoom - in technique , where we first simulate a cosmological box of @xmath3 mpc on a side using only dark matter ( dm hereafter ) particles .",
    "next , we select a region that will collapse into a mw size object by z=0 .",
    "we populate this region and its surroundings at high resolution with gas and dm particles , introducing @xmath4cdm density fluctuations down to the new inter - particle separation scale . outside of this region , the density field",
    "is sampled more coarsely with high mass dm particles to provide long range forces .",
    "such initial conditions are re - generated at @xmath5 using the @xcite power spectrum in a @xmath4cdm cosmology : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we include standard cooling processes for a gas of primordial composition @xcite and the uv background @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect galactic outflows .    in total",
    ", the simulation has 6.6 million particles .",
    "the most massive halo in the high - resolution region ( hereafter , mwh ) , analyzed in detail in what follows , at z=0 has @xmath10 and contains 1.4 million baryonic and 0.9 million dm particles .",
    "each gas particle begins with a mass of @xmath11 , while stars are half this mass .",
    "gravitational softening is the same for dm and baryonic particles , @xmath12pc ( plummer equivalent ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : clouds ] , we show the inner regions of mwh . gas particles with @xmath13 are plotted close to face - on and edge - on projections of the disk , revealing the presence of a population of dense gaseous clouds together with a central galactic disk . plotting gas colder than 30000k selects an identical cloud population . at low redshift mwh",
    "contains a large number of cold , @xmath14 , dense clouds in a @xmath15 ( edge on ) times @xmath16 ( face on ) region around the disk .",
    "we plot gas particles with small arrows to indicate the velocity field , demonstrating that the clouds exhibit a global sense of rotation , similar in orientation to the outer disk .",
    "= 3.4 in = 3.4 in    we identify clouds with @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 using the code skid .",
    "the results are mainly determined by the temperature threshold and are robust for any @xmath20 . to distinguish clouds from galaxies we modified skid to include thermal support of gas to properly identify self - gravitating systems .",
    "bound objects include the main galactic disk , several satellite galaxies ( one visible in the upper left corner of figure  [ fig : clouds ] ) , and a small number of gaseous clumps that are not associated with a dm or stellar component .",
    "these self - gravitating clouds are close to the halo center , where the external pressure compresses them to high densities .",
    "for simplicity , we exclude all bound objects from the remainder of the analysis , but apart from the main gaseous disk they contribute negligibly to the cold gas budget .",
    "cloud masses range from @xmath21 to few @xmath22 .",
    "we note , however , that we are limited at low masses by the simulation resolution .",
    "some of the most massive clouds are at larger radii and often represent a dense slab of gas , which might be susceptible to further instabilities . typical column densities ( for the total cold gas , i.e. no ionization correction which could be substantial ) of clouds are @xmath23 .      the amount of virialized gas increases with time as the halo grows and hot gas fills low density regions in - between colder , denser filaments @xcite . at high redshift , filaments survive within hot halos even when the hot medium dominates the halo gas budget ( @xmath24 ) . however ,",
    "at lower redshift the density of filaments decreases and the temperature increases so they are more easily destroyed at small radii by large scale shocks in a hot halo .",
    "this happens where halo shock conditions are favorable for hot , overdense gas to propagate outwards @xcite .",
    "filamentary remnants that penetrate into halos but not quite to galaxies set the stage for cloud formation . for the mwh this epoch starts roughly at @xmath25 after the last major merger is completed .",
    "the last significant ( @xmath26 ) merger occurs around z=0.5 and soon afterwards mwh reaches a quasi - static configuration that lasts 2 - 3 gyrs , although cloud formation proceeds in a similar manner for @xmath27 . at @xmath28 around 10 percent of the halo gas ( excluding gas in the galaxies ) within the inner @xmath29 , @xmath30 , is in cold gaseous clouds as a result of a balance between cloud creation , accretion and destruction .",
    "this is consistent with estimates of the total mass of the hvc population @xcite .",
    "the density of the hot component at a distance of 50 kpc from the main galaxy is @xmath31 , consistent with observational limits @xcite .      to understand their origin we follow cloud particles backwards in time and determine the maximum temperature that they had in the past , @xmath32 .",
    "this tells us if the clouds form through instabilities in a hot corona or if they were seeded by colder structures .",
    "figure  [ fig : tmax ] shows the results of this analysis ( for `` resolved '' clouds , @xmath33 32 particles ) .",
    "most of the mass in the clouds never reached @xmath34 , characteristic of the mwh at z=0 , but instead clouds form from , @xmath35 material , before they cool to @xmath36 .",
    "these are temperatures characteristic of low - redshift , large - scale filaments fueling gas onto mwh .",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 is similar in the redshift interval @xmath37 , implying a connection between cloud formation and `` cold mode '' accretion active at higher redshifts .",
    "= 0.9    we illustrate this process in figure  [ fig : rt ] .",
    "an overdense , warm filament penetrates to intermediate radii in the halo , visible in the panels which show density and temperature .",
    "the filament is not directly connected to the galaxy but manages to reach 30 - 40 kpc radius before being heated to higher temperatures .",
    "the large impact parameter with respect to the central galaxy creates a density inversion where `` heavier '' fluid lies on top of a `` lighter '' one in an external gravitational field ( of the parent halo ) , providing the conditions for rt instabilities to operate .",
    "the initial instabilities that act on overdense filamentary gas often produce cometary tail - like morphologies , similar to rt instabilities in the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these are further compressed by higher pressure gas at slightly smaller radii and quickly become cooling unstable , forming cold , dense clouds .",
    "additional sites of cloud formation throughout the mwh can be seen in the figure , often where compression of infalling gas by halo shocks and pressure from surrounding hot gas promotes faster development of instabilities .",
    "= 3.4 in = 3.4 in = 3.4 in = 3.4 in    the filament is also moving with respect to the surrounding lower density gas .",
    "it is therefore possible that kelvin helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities can affect this configuration .",
    "it has been shown that sph techniques have difficulty handling kh instabilities @xcite so it is important to estimate the timescales for a dominant mode to affect and destroy such penetrating filaments before they become cooling or rt unstable at small radii .",
    "the relevant timescale is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the densities of the heavier and more dilute components , respectively , @xmath41 is the spatial scale of the instability , and @xmath42 is the relative velocity of the two phases . for a spherical cloud moving in a dilute medium the disruption time is @xmath43 ( self - gravity can make it even longer ) @xcite . at the temperatures typical of penetrating filaments in the @xmath44 mwh , @xmath45 which for approximate pressure equilibrium implies a density contrast of @xmath46 .",
    "the overdense region in figure  [ fig : rt ] moves with velocities @xmath47 km / s through the hot medium .",
    "the largest available mode is responsible for the destruction of structures .",
    "the length of the structure is @xmath47 kpc and its typical width is @xmath48 kpc . assuming a @xmath49 case for a wavelength comparable to the filament s width",
    ", it takes about @xmath50 yrs for the instability to act .",
    "this is longer than the time over which the filament is destroyed by shocks and other instabilities and the time needed for gas to flow through the instability region visible in figure  [ fig : rt ] .",
    "it is also possible that the filament length is relevant which increases this timescale by factor of few .",
    "we therefore conclude that this structure can indeed penetrate into a hot halo to create such a configuration .",
    "only much smaller modes can affect the infalling cold gas in a filament , perhaps enhancing the surface shearing layer .",
    "next , we estimate the timescale for rt instabilities @xcite to act : @xmath51}^{-1/2 } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the gravitational acceleration . taking the acceleration at 50 kpc in mwh and a density contrast @xmath53",
    ", we estimate the timescale for the instability at @xmath53 kpc scales , which corresponds to the example in figure  [ fig : rt ] : @xmath54 yr , comparable to @xmath55 yr of the photo - ionized gas in a warm filament at @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , rt and cooling instabilities are acting together to form pressure supported clouds with @xmath14 .",
    "both of these timescales are shorter than the time over which the overdense structure is present in the inner halo .",
    "this process often simultaneously forms many clouds in the same region , yielding cloud complexes . at this stage ,",
    "kh instabilities of similar wavelength could play a role .",
    "when clouds start to form , shearing velocities are slowed down by pressure gradients and shocks before they accelerate to terminal velocity so the role played by kh instabilities is unclear .",
    "halos formed in fully cosmological environments are complex and dynamic systems .",
    "in addition to the processes described above , infalling satellites can be stripped of gas as they pass through overdense filaments in the outskirts of halos , providing material for further instabilities and cloud formation .",
    "this effect can alleviate the need for a high density hot medium to produce large gaseous tails such as the one observed in the magellanic cloud system @xcite .",
    "an example of this is visible in the upper left corners of the bottom two panels in figure  [ fig : rt ] .",
    "infalling substructures create density waves and shocks in the halo , providing a source of further compression and acceleration which enables rt instabilities to develop even without the gravitational pull of the parent halo .",
    "similarly , we expect density inversions and rt instabilities to be more common in simulations with galactic outflows ( both stellar and agn ) , where winds can temporarily push , compress and accelerate both galactic and infalling material @xcite .",
    "the mwh has a growth history typical for its mass indicating that this cloud formation process is general . in future work",
    "we will discuss cloud formation in larger halos where clouds form at earlier times ( e.g. , see figure 6 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "halo clouds are likely part of halo absorption systems observed at intermediate redshift and some are likely analogs of the hvcs . however , from figure  [ fig : clouds ] it is already clear that many of the cold clouds have velocities comparable to the galactic rotation which will make searches for such objects difficult @xcite .",
    "cloud infall at large radii will also likely trigger star formation and provide kinematic enhancements in the outer disks .",
    "cloud formation from cooling instabilities in an idealized setting was simulated in @xcite , demonstrating that large entropy cores are needed for this mechanism to operate .",
    "this is supported by @xcite who examined relevant timescales for the onset of cooling instabilities that begin with small density enhancements and concluded that unless the entropy profile of the halo gas is shallow , buoyancy and conduction will prevent cloud formation . in our simulation clouds",
    "are seeded at intermediate radii starting from already moderate overdensities , for which this linear analysis does not apply . however , the inner gas entropy and density profiles of mwh are quite shallow , so it is not clear if slower cloud formation is prevented .",
    "interestingly , clouds just below our resolution limit , @xmath58 particles , do have a larger contribution from a hot gas component .",
    "more work is needed to determine if this is a physical effect or purely numerical if unresolved objects partially mix in hotter gas . in reality , even a moderate metallicity of halo gas could increase cloud formation efficiency .    both sph and eulerian codes have shortcomings in following the instabilities relevant when clouds move in a hot medium .",
    "new techniques , such as the moving mesh code of @xcite , may avoid these shortcomings , providing new insights into the formation and evolution of hvcs .",
    "it is interesting to determine if clouds formed in mwh can survive their trip through the inner halo and rain onto the galaxy , providing fresh fuel for star formation . in the absence of magnetic fields ,",
    "thermal conduction will directly evaporate clouds smaller than about @xmath59 in a free fall time for the typical radii where clouds form in mwh @xcite .",
    "the evolution of more massive clouds is likely governed by a combination of rt and kh instabilities ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulations do not have sufficient resolution to follow instabilities on such small scales and sph itself might not be suitable for this task .",
    "we can , however , estimate relevant timescales .",
    "idealized simulations show that clouds fragment when they sweep up a mass comparable to their own @xcite .",
    "therefore , we integrate the descent of clouds on radial orbits , assuming they form at 70 kpc and need to reach 5 kpc to fall onto a galaxy .",
    "we use @xmath60 , @xmath61 and a density profile @xmath62 .",
    "we take @xmath63 ( bracketing the inner density profile of the mwh ; for simplicity we assume @xmath64 const . ) , and normalize the density at 70 kpc .",
    "we find that clouds above @xmath65 survive if clouds are compressed during their descent .",
    "this mass is @xmath53 times higher if the cloud radius remains fixed during infall . in both cases this is smaller than masses of the clouds formed in our simulation .",
    "we also directly integrate cloud orbits accounting for gravity and ram pressure , assuming that clouds have angular momentum similar to the disk gas .",
    "this only mildly increases the mass limit for cloud survival compared to radial infall .",
    "therefore , massive clouds seeded in the inner halo are likely able to bring cold material to a central disk . in the non - wind simulations at z=0 this yields @xmath66/yr of fresh gas accretion , but if galactic outflows are included this increases to @xmath67/yr ( because more material is saved for later times ) . for the mw ,",
    "whose mass is factor of @xmath68 larger than the simulated mwh , the rates are likely higher , providing enough fuel for continuous star formation over a several gyr period .",
    "using a state - of - the - art numerical simulation of structure formation in a @xmath4cdm universe we follow the formation of small @xmath69 cold , pressure confined clouds in a halo similar to the mw .",
    "most clouds are not randomly formed from small fluctuations in a hot , @xmath70 , medium as has often been supposed .",
    "instead , they originate from overdense , @xmath71 , filamentary gas within a hot halo at low redshift .",
    "such gas creates a density and entropy inversion in a gravitational field , driving simultaneous cooling and rt instabilities . during their initial evolution , many clouds form from cometary structures while later evolution can not be followed properly with our computational scheme .",
    "however , simple estimates indicate that a large fraction of such clouds could indeed survive their trip to the halo center and provide a supply of gas for late time star formation in galaxies ."
