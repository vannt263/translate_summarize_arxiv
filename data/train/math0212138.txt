    "note that , in the case @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the invariant @xmath37 computes the link group , namely @xmath38 for any link @xmath39 in @xmath40 .",
    "the goal of section [ sect3 ] is to give topological constructions of the artin type representations and of the groups @xmath8 , for @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath1 is a non - zero integer , then our constructions coincide with wada s constructions ( see @xcite , section 3 ) .",
    "in fact , our constructions are straightforward extensions of wada s constructions to all artin type representations .",
    "in section [ sect4 ] , we prove that artin type representations are faithful ( proposition [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath1 has infinite order , then the artin type representation @xmath11 contains the classical artin representation and , therefore , is faithful by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , proposition [ 4.1 ] is mostly of interest in the case where @xmath1 has finite order .",
    "in fact the proof may be easily reduced to the case @xmath41 and @xmath24 , however we will not need to use any such reduction , as our method applies just as easily in all cases .",
    "we note also that the case where @xmath0 is cyclic of order @xmath42 follows ( by somewhat different methods ) from section 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "the proof of proposition [ 4.1 ] is inspired by the proof of theorem a of @xcite , and it is based on dehornoy s work on orders on braids @xcite , @xcite .    the remaining sections ( sections [ sect5 ] and [ sect6 ] ) are dedicated to the study of semidirect products @xmath10 , where @xmath43 is the artin type representation associated to a pair @xmath6 .    if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath10 is the artin group @xmath44 associated to the coxeter graph @xmath3 ( not to be confused with the braid group @xmath3 , which is itself an artin group , of type @xmath45 ) .",
    "this result is implicit in @xcite , @xcite , and explicit in @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath44 is well - understood .",
    "in particular , solutions to the word and conjugacy problems in this group are known ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , it is torsion free ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , its center is an infinite cyclic group ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , it is biautomatic ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and it has an explicit finite dimensional classifying space ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a natural next step is to understand the groups @xmath10 in the case where @xmath26 is a wada representation ( of type 4 ) , namely , when @xmath23 and @xmath46 .",
    "one can readily establish that , for these representations , the group @xmath10 fails to be an artin group unless @xmath47 .",
    "it turns out , however , that these groups do have quite a lot in common with artin groups : like the artin groups , they belong to a family of groups known as _ garside groups_.    briefly , a _",
    "garside group _ is a group @xmath5 which admits a left invariant lattice order and contains a so - called _ garside element _ , a positive element @xmath48 whose positive divisors generate @xmath5 and such that conjugation by @xmath48 leaves the lattice structure invariant ( there are also conditions placed on the positive cone of @xmath5 , that it be a finitely generated atomic monoid  see section [ sect5 ] for more details ) .",
    "the notion of a garside group was introduced by dehornoy and the second author @xcite in a slightly restricted sense , and , later , by dehornoy @xcite in the larger sense which is now generally used .",
    "the theory of garside groups is largely inspired by the papers of garside @xcite , which treated the case of braid groups , and brieskorn and saito @xcite which generalised garside s work to artin groups .",
    "the artin groups of spherical ( or finite ) type which include , notably , the braid groups as well as the groups @xmath44 mentioned above , are motivating examples .",
    "other interesting examples of garside groups include all torus link groups ( see @xcite ) and some generalized braid groups associated to finite complex reflection groups .",
    "garside groups have many attractive properties .",
    "solutions to the word and conjugacy problems in these groups are known ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , they are torsion free ( see @xcite ) , they admit canonical decompositions as iterated crossed products of `` irreducible '' components , and the center of each component is an infinite cyclic group ( see @xcite ) , they are biautomatic ( see @xcite ) , and they admit finite dimensional classifying spaces ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another important property of the garside groups is that there exist criteria in terms of presentations to detect them ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in section [ sect6 ]",
    ", we prove that , if @xmath0 is a garside group , @xmath1 a garside element of @xmath0 , and @xmath26 the artin type representation associated to @xmath6 , then @xmath49 is also a garside group ( theorem [ 6.1 ] ) .",
    "this result applies in particular to the case @xmath23 and @xmath50 , but also applies , for example , to the case where @xmath0 is another braid group , say @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a non - trivial power of the fundamental element of @xmath53 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ 6.1 ] is based on a criterion which is developed in section [ sect5 ] for proving that a given group is a garside group .",
    "this criterion rests largely on the  coherence \" condition of @xcite which has its roots in the original arguments of garside @xcite .",
    "it is essentially a variation of other criteria appearing in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite prop .",
    "our criterion differs from that of dehornoy @xcite just mentioned in that it is not algorithmic .",
    "in particular , we do not give any method for finding a garside element .",
    "however , it is relatively easy to apply once one has an appropriate presentation and an expression for a garside element to hand .    finally , we add an appendix to our paper in order to answer a question posed by shpilrain in his study of wada s representations @xcite , and which is otherwise a little tangential to the main subject of this paper .",
    "let @xmath5 be a group .",
    "two representations @xmath54 are called _ equivalent _ if there exist automorphisms @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for all @xmath27 .    * remark . * if two representations @xmath58 are equivalent , then the groups @xmath59 and @xmath60 are isomorphic .",
