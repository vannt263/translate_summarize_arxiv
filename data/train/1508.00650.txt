    "for quite some time , physicists have considered einstein s general relativity ( gr ) to be an effective theory of gravity .",
    "therefore , in order to find the happy marriage between quantum theory and gravity , we need to know the underlying fundamental theory of gravity .",
    "one recent proposal in this address has been the horava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory @xcite , that is , a power - counting renormalizable theory with consistent ultraviolet ( uv ) behaviour .",
    "furthermore , the theory has one fixed point in the infrared ( ir ) limit namely gr @xcite . in terms of the above , black holes ( bh )",
    "are important solutions for field equations in any gravitational theory , including those such as einstein - hilbert , brans - dicke , hl , @xmath1 , string theories and any generalisation or modification of einstein s gravity . at the quantum level ,",
    "bh play the same role as hydrogen atom and we hope they give us some clues about the observables of any quantum theory of gravity . as such , it is important to study the physical properties of bh solutions , such as decay rate , greybody factors , or their quasinormal modes .",
    "quasinormal modes ( qnms ) , known as `` ringing '' in bh , are very important in order to understand the classical and quantum aspects of bh physics .",
    "the qnms give us hints about the stability of bh under consideration , as in this paper , and can be used to compute the spectrum of the area operator using the semiclassical approach developed by hod @xcite .",
    "the determination of qnms is based on the dynamics of matter fields and on the metric perturbations in the bh background . in this work indeed , we are interested in the stability of the @xmath0-dilatonic hl bh using a qnms approach ; qnms associated with the perturbations of different fields have been considered in different works @xcite , including those involving ds and ads space @xcite and higher dimensional models , where the qnms can be computed for a brane situated in the vicinity of a @xmath2-dimensional bh @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs in @xmath3 dimensions @xcite , and for acoustic bh @xcite .",
    "qnms of dilatonic bh in @xmath4 dimensions can be found in refs . @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional theories of gravity have recently attracted much attention@xcite as simple toy models that possess many features of gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "they also have bh solutions which play important roles in revealing various aspects of spacetime geometry and quantization of gravity , and are also related to string theory @xcite .",
    "the qnms of @xmath0 dilatonic bh for scalar and fermionic perturbations were studied in @xcite .",
    "the determination of qnms for a specific geometry implies solving the field equations for different types of perturbations ( scalar , fermionic , vectorial , etc . ) , with suitable boundary conditions that reflect the fact that this geometry describes a bh .",
    "the qnms of a classical scalar perturbation of bh are defined as the solutions of the klein - gordon equation characterised by purely ingoing waves at the horizon , @xmath5 , since , at least classically , an outgoing flux is not allowed at the horizon .",
    "in addition , one has to impose boundary conditions on the solutions in the asymptotic region ( infinity ) , and for that reason it is crucial to use asymptotic geometry for the spacetime under study . in the case of an asymptotically flat spacetime ,",
    "the condition we need to impose over the wave function is to have a purely outgoing wave function @xmath6 at the infinity @xcite . in general , the qnms are given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the real and imaginary parts of the frequency @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the study of qnms can be implemented as one possible simple alternative test for studying the stability of the system . in this sense , any imaginary frequency with the wrong sign would mean an exponentially growing mode , rather than a damping one .",
    "the organisation of this article is as follows : in section ii , we describe briefly the hl theory and specify the @xmath0-dilatonic bh solutions . in section iii ,",
    "we compute the qnms and explore the criteria for the stability of the two bh metrics under consideration .",
    "we finish with conclusions in section iv .",
    "in the following , we will describe the hl theory as developed in ref .",
    "the hl theory provided a new approach to quantum gravity and its principal idea is based on the breaking of the lorentz invariance by equipping the spacetime with additional geometric structure , a prefered foliation which defines the splitting of the coordinates into space and time ; in this theory the lorentz invariance is assumed to appear only at the low energies limit .",
    "one can decompose the spacetime as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the lapse and shift functions respectively and @xmath13 is the three - dimensional metric .",
    "the action is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the planck mass , @xmath16 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath17 is the well - known extrinsic curvature tensor , which is stated in the adm formulation as @xmath18 being @xmath19 its trace . the last term in ( [ eq : hlaction ] ) , @xmath20 , is invariant under three - dimensional diffeomorphisms and is known as the `` potential '' term .",
    "this term is a function of the three - dimensional metric and its derivatives . in explicit form",
    "we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 are coupling constants , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature constructed with the spatial metric . @xmath25 .",
    "the introduction of the `` potential '' term in ( [ eq : hlaction ] ) improve the uv behavior of the graviton propagator and additionally leads to different scaling of space and time @xmath26 when the lapse function depend only on time , @xmath27 , we say that we are dealing with the `` projectable '' version of the hl theory and the `` non - projectable '' version is given when the lapse function can depend on space and time . in ref .",
    "@xcite an extension of the non - projectable version of hl gravity was made by the introduction of a extra mode in the `` potential '' term , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown that this extra mode can acquire a regular quadratic lagrangian .",
    "the extra mode is given by @xmath29 geometrically this vector represents the proper acceleration of the unit normals to the spatial slices . for the two - dimensional case",
    "there are only two terms that contribute to the quadratic lagrangian : @xmath24 and @xmath30 .",
    "the hl gravity has two - dimensional solutions that characterise dilatonic bh and can be used to study the physical properties of bh in general ; furthermore , some features of this theory , due to the fact that it utilizes two dimensions , open the possibility of understanding physical consequences in higher dimensional theories . as a summary ,",
    "let us start with the hl - dilaton gravity in two dimensions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 where , as mentioned before , the quadratic lagrangian for the hl theory in two dimensions comes from the contribution of the terms @xmath24 and @xmath30 @xmath32 and @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants . using the fact that @xmath37 and admitting @xmath38 together with the relativistic limit @xmath39 , we are left with the action @xmath40 from now on , the prime denotes derivative with respect the coordinate @xmath41 . in two dimensions",
    "the extra mode @xmath42 is simply @xmath43 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new set of bh solutions in two - dimensional hl gravity was found for action ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "the solutions are described by @xmath44 and @xmath45 these solutions were obtained by using the quantity @xmath46 the derivative of the scalar potential given as a function of an implicit scalar field which in turns depends on the spatial coordinate .",
    "this was done because for generalized potentials is not always possible obtain analytical solutions .",
    "we would like to focus our attention on the following two cases ,    @xmath47 first case : described by fixing the constants in the following way ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this case @xmath52",
    ". therefore , the metric for this solution can be written as follows @xmath53 where the parameter @xmath54 is related to the lapse function @xmath55 .",
    "this solution was found for the first time in @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 second case : here we fix the constants as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; therefore , we have @xmath60 , and the solution is given by @xmath61dt^{2 } +   \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\eta}\\right)x^{2 } + 2mx - \\epsilon}dx^{2}. \\label{eq : sol2}\\ ] ] the horizon of the black hole is located at @xmath62 if we define the variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 one gets @xmath65 which is a suitable expression to study the quasinormal modes of this black hole , and we have defined @xmath66 . in this new coordinate system ,",
    "the horizon of the black hole is located at @xmath67 .",
    "the spacetimes , described by ( [ eq : lowest ] ) and ( [ eq : sol2 ] ) , are conformally flat @xcite .",
    "in order to study the qnms , we consider a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity propagating in the background of the two - dimensional hl bh .",
    "we consider the following action for the scalar field @xmath68 = \\int d^{2}x \\sqrt{-g}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\varphi)^{2 } - \\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\\varphi^{2 } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the mass of the scalar field . from the variation of @xmath70",
    "the field equation is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dalambertian operator , in the following sections , we will solve the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) for the spacetimes described in the previous section .",
    "the case of a massive scalar field perturbing the background described by the metric ( [ eq : lowest ] ) was discussed for first time in @xcite .",
    "if we use @xmath74 the equation of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) , is represented by @xmath75 for this metric and massive scalar field , the qnms were computed in @xcite , where the authors claimed that the solution for the qnms are completely different from the standard case where the qnms have a discrete spectrum .",
    "they proposed a real and continuous spectrum for the qnms of a scalar perturbation . in the next section ,",
    "we look at this situation , but instead use the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath76 place of the modified bessel functions .",
    "now , using the tortoise coordinate defined by @xmath77 we can write the eq .",
    "( [ eq : nobessel0 ] ) as a schroedinger type equation with effective potential @xcite @xmath78 this potential diverges when @xmath79 .",
    "if we consider the variable @xmath80 @xcite , after some straightforward algebra , the equation of motion ( [ eq : nobessel0 ] ) can be written as the bessel equation , @xmath81 where @xmath82 ; this equation can be transformed into the confluent hypergeometric equation using the change @xmath83 @xcite , and we find @xmath84 whose solution is given in terms of the confluent hypergeometric , or kummer , functions @xmath85 where @xmath86 are constants and the number @xmath87 in general need not be an integer @xcite . in the following",
    "we will consider two cases for the @xmath87 parameter since we are interested in exploring all its possible values .",
    "+ @xmath47 non - integer @xmath87    in order to compute the qnms , we need to impose adequate boundary conditions that represent a purely outgoing wave at infinity and purely ingoing wave near the horizon of the bh ( a condition often used in flat spacetime ) .",
    "another situation occurs when the asymptotic behaviour of the spacetime is not flat , e.g. asymptotically ads space ; in these kind of spaces , the potential diverges at infinity , and we can therefore impose @xmath88 ( dirichlet boundary condition ) or @xmath89 ( neumann boundary condition ) at infinity . as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) , in this case we have an asymptotically ads space .",
    "therefore , we need to apply boundary conditions to the qnms over the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kumer ] ) , which is given by @xmath90 to satisfy the boundary conditions properly , we set @xmath91 in order to have only ingoing waves at the horizon ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath93 at infinity is given by @xcite @xmath94 and therefore our solution at the infinity ( @xmath95 ) reads as follow , @xmath96 we can see that the scalar field vanishes as @xmath95 , this confirms the absence of qnms for this hl bh under scalar perturbations , a similar situation was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the qnms of the extremal btz bh .",
    "the conclusion of this case was discussed in @xcite , and represents a continuous spectrum .",
    "additionaly , if we impose the neumann boundary condition , we obtain a similar asymptotic vanishing behavior for the flux @xmath97 in light of the meaning of qnms , for any bh perturbation its geometry produces damped oscillations , this is the so - called ringing in bh .",
    "it is well known that the frequencies of these oscillations and their damping periods are completely fixed by the bh properties , and as such , are independent of the nature of the initial perturbation . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , for scalar perturbations the oscillations have a continuous spectrum and are not discrete , as would be expected for a bh .",
    "this result is very strange and in our opinion , devoid of physical meaning ; this is because it is well known that oscillations of qnms are similar to normal modes of a closed system . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the second solution of the confluent hypergeometric equation and show that qnm oscillations have a discrete spectrum .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath87 integer    now we are considering the case where @xmath87 is an integer number . for @xmath87 integer , the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : kumer ] ) changes . in the expression ( [ eq : kumersolgen ] ) , the function @xmath98 of the second term must be replaced by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 represents the digamma function , @xmath101 is the euler s constant , and @xmath102 then , we have @xmath103 in order to have only ingoing waves at the horizon ( @xmath92 ) , we set @xmath91 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath104-function at infinity is given by @xmath105 therefore , the general solution at infinity reads as follows , @xmath106z^{-\\left(4\\nu+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}\\frac{\\gamma(2\\nu+1)}{\\gamma(-\\nu-1/2 ) } e^{2(i-1)z}. \\label{eq : sollimitw}\\ ] ] if we consider that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is an integer number , we are able to fulfill the dirichlet boundary condition at infinity . from this result",
    "we can obtain the frequency of the qnms as @xmath109 and using the neumann condition for a vanishing flux at infinity , we obtain the same result for the qnms as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegaw ] ) .      for the metric ( [ eq : lowest ] ) , when @xmath110 , we use the standard definition for qnms , the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) which reads @xmath111 where we have assumed @xmath112 . if we define the quantity @xmath113 and the change of variable @xmath114 we can write equation ( [ eq : nobessel ] ) as follows @xmath115 where @xmath116 . note that in the new coordinate @xmath117 , the horizon of the bh is located at @xmath118 and infinity at @xmath119 .",
    "with the change @xmath120 , the last equation reduces to the hypergeometric differential equation for the function @xmath121 , that is , @xmath122 in this case the coefficients @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are given by the relations @xmath126 providing the expressions for the coefficients @xmath127 and for the exponents we obtain @xmath128 without loss of generality , we have chosen the negative signs for the exponents .",

    ". therefore , the second term in the last equation must vanish ; this is fulfilled , at the poles of @xmath144 or @xmath145 , where the scalar field satisfies the considered boundary condition only when @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "these conditions determine the form of the quasinormal modes , @xmath148      for the second metric given in eq .",

    "is discussed in @xcite , where they defined qnms to be modes with only ingoing waves near the horizon and vanishing at infinity .",
    "thus , the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) can be written as @xmath150 now , we will consider a solution of type @xmath151 and definition @xmath152 , for which the radial equation can be written as follows @xmath153 where the prime denotes derivates with respect the variable @xmath154 .",

    "this article was devoted to studying the response of two @xmath0 bh under scalar perturbations .",
    "we focused on the bh solutions found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of hl gravity .",
    "the bh studied in the present paper also correspond to solutions arising from standard gr plus the dilaton field ; therefore , the physical properties of these bh can be used in different contexts .",
    "we noted that in studying the qnm oscillations of the metric ( [ eq : lowest ] ) with massive scalar field perturbations it is necessary to look at the solution in terms of the confluent hypergeometric , or kummer , functions , and , as a result , found two different cases , in one case we have absent qnms under scalar perturbations and in the second case we have a discrete spectrum .",
    "these results are different from those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the qnms are a continuous spectrum .",
    "also , we computed the frequencies of the massless scalar field as sources of perturbations , and again obtained a discrete spectrum . from these results , we conclude that this bh is stable under massive and massless scalar perturbations .",
    "on the other hand , for spacetime in which the cosmological constant does not vanish , we found , in addition to the exact quasinormal frequencies , that it is possible to see that when the mass of the scalar field is large , the geometry becomes unstable .",
