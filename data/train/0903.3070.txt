    "spolyar et al . ( 2008 ; hereafter paper i ) proposed a new phase of stellar evolution : the first stars to form in the universe may be dark stars , powered by dark matter heating rather than by nuclear fusion . here dark matter ( dm ) , while constituting a negligible fraction of the star s mass , provides the energy source that powers the star .",
    "the first stars in the universe mark the end of the cosmic dark ages , provide the enriched gas required for later stellar generations , contribute to reionization , and may be precursors to black holes that coalesce and power bright early quasars .",
    "one of the outstanding problems in astrophysics is to investigate the mass and properties of these first stars .",
    "depending on their initial masses , the stars lead very different lives , produce very different elemental enrichment , and end up as very different objects . in this paper",
    ", we find the mass , luminosity , temperature , and radius of dark stars as a function of time : our results differ in important ways from the standard picture of first stars without dm heating .",
    "the dm particles considered here are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , such as the lightest supersymmetric particles or kaluza - klein dark matter ( for reviews , see jungman et al .",
    "1996 ; bertone et al . 2005 ; hooper & profumo 2007 ) .",
    "the search for these particles is one of the major motivations for the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "the particles in consideration are their own antiparticles ; thus , they annihilate among themselves in the early universe and naturally provide the correct relic density today to explain the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the first stars are particularly good sites for dm annihilation because they form in a very high density dm environment : they form at early times at high redshifts ( density scales as @xmath4 ) and in the high density centers of dm haloes .",
    "the first stars form at redshifts @xmath5 in dm halos of @xmath6 ( for reviews see e.g. ripamonti & abel 2005 ; barkana & loeb 2001 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ; bromm & larson 2004 ; see also yoshida et al .",
    "2006 ) one star is thought to form inside one such dm halo .",
    "these halos consist of 85% dm and 15% baryons in the form of metal - free gas made of h and he .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the baryonic matter cools and collapses via h@xmath7 cooling ( peebles & dicke 1968 ; matsuda et al . 1971 ; hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) into a single small protostar ( omukai & nishi 1998 ) at the center of the halo .    as our canonical values",
    ", we use the standard @xmath8 for the annihilation cross section and @xmath9 for the wimp particle mass . in this paper",
    "we examine a variety of possible wimp masses and cross sections , and find that our main result holds independent of these properties .",
    "we consider @xmath10 = 1 gev , 10 gev , 100 gev , 1 tev , and 10 tev .",
    "this variety of wimp masses may be traded for a variety of values of the annihilation cross section , since dm heating scales as @xmath11 .",
    "paper i found that dm annihilation provides a powerful heat source in the first stars , a source so intense that its heating overwhelms all cooling mechanisms ; subsequent work has found that the heating can dominate over fusion as well once it becomes important at later stages ( see below ) .",
    "paper i outlined the three key ingredients for dark stars : 1 ) high dark matter densities , 2 ) the annihilation products get trapped inside the star , and 3 ) dm heating wins over other cooling or heating mechanisms .",
    "these same ingredients are required throughout the evolution of the dark stars , whether during the protostellar phase or during the main sequence phase .",
    "wimp annihilation produces energy at a rate per unit volume @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass density of the wimps .",
    "once the gas density of the collapsing protostar exceeds a critical value , most of the annihilation energy is trapped in the star .",
    "for a 100 gev particle , when the hydrogen density reaches @xmath14 , typically 1/3 of the energy is lost to neutrinos that escape the star , while the other 2/3 of the energy is trapped inside the star .",
    "hence the luminosity from the dm heating is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume element . from this point forwards ,",
    "the dm heating beats any cooling mechanisms .",
    "this point is the beginning of the life of the dark star , a dm powered star which lasts until the dm fuel runs out .",
    "the dm constitutes a negligible fraction of the mass of the dark star ( less than one percent of the total stellar mass ) and yet powers the star .",
    "this `` power of darkness '' is due to the 67% efficiency of converting the dm mass into an energy source for the star , in contrast to the @xmath171% efficiency of converting nuclear mass into energy in the case of fusion .    in this paper",
    "we ascertain the properties of the dark star as it grows from an initially small mass at its inception to its final fate as a very large star . at the beginning ,",
    "when the dm heating first dominates inside the star , the dark star mass for our canonical case of 100 gev mass particles is @xmath18 with a radius of 17 au ( abel et al .",
    "2002 ; gao et al .",
    "then further matter can rain down upon the star , causing the dark star to grow . by the time the star reaches about 3 m@xmath19 , with a radius of",
    "110 au , it can be approximated as an object in thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium , with dark matter heating balancing the radiated luminosity .",
    "there is @xmath20 of unstable gas ( @xmath17 jeans mass ) which can in principle accrete onto the star , unless there is some feedback to stop it .",
    "we build up the dark star from a few solar masses by accretion , in steps of one solar mass . at each stage",
    "we find the stellar structure as a polytrope in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium .",
    "we continue this process of building up the ds until the dm runs out .",
    "as seen in equation ( 1 ) , a key element in the annihilation is knowledge of the dm density inside the ds .",
    "the initial dm density profile in the @xmath6 halo is not enough to drive dm heating .",
    "we consider three mechanisms for enhancing the density .",
    "first , as originally proposed in paper 1 and confirmed in freese et al ( 2008b ) , adiabatic contraction ( ac ) drives up the density .",
    "as the gas collapses into the star , dm is gravitationally pulled along with it .",
    "second , as the ds accretes more baryonic matter , again dm falls in along with the gas . eventually the supply of dm due to this continued ac runs out , and the star may heat up until fusion sets in . however , there is the possibility of repopulating the dm in the ds due to a third source of dm , capture from the ambient medium ( iocco 2008 ; freese et al .",
    "capture only becomes important once the ds is already large ( hundreds of solar masses ) , and only with the additional particle physics ingredient of a significant wimp / nucleon elastic scattering cross section at or near the current experimental bounds .",
    "capture can be important as long as the ds resides in a sufficiently high density environment . in this case",
    "the ds lives until it leaves the womb at the untouched center of a @xmath6 dm halo .",
    "unfortunately for the ds , such a comfortable home is not likely to persist for more than 10 - 100 myr ( if the simulations are right ) , though in the extreme case one may hope that they survive to the present day . in this paper",
    "we consider all three mechanisms for dm enhancement , including dm capture .",
    "we remark at the outset that ac is absolutely essential to the existence of the ds .",
    "none of these three mechanisms would operate were it not for some ac driving up the density in the vicinity of the ds .    previously ( freese et al .",
    "2008a ) , we considered one specific case , that of 100 gev particle mass and a constant accretion rate of @xmath21/yr with no capture , assuming that the ds stellar structure can be described by a series of @xmath22 polytropes .",
    "we found that it takes @xmath23 million years to build up the star to its final mass , which we found to be very large , @xmath24 . while the accretion was in process ,",
    "the dark stars were quite bright and cool , with luminosities @xmath25 and surface temperatures @xmath26 .",
    "these results are in contrast to the standard properties of the population iii stars ( the first stars ) .",
    "standard pop iii stars are predicted to form by accretion onto a much smaller protostar ( @xmath27 ; omukai & nishi 1998 ) , to reach much hotter surface temperatures @xmath2850,000 k during accretion , and at the end of accretion to be far less massive ( @xmath29 ) due to a variety of feedback mechanisms that stop accretion of the gas ( mckee and tan 2008 ) .",
    "these differences in properties between dark stars and standard pop iii stars lead to a universe that can look quite different , as discussed below .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a complete study of building up the dark star mass and finding the stellar structure at each step in mass accretion .",
    "we include many new effects in this paper compared to freese et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "( 1 ) we generalize the particle physics parameters by considering a variety of particle masses or equivalently annihilation cross sections .",
    "( 2 ) we study two possible accretion rates : a variable accretion rate from tan & mckee ( 2004 ) and an alternate variable accretion rate found by oshea & norman ( 2007 ) .",
    "( 3 ) whereas previously we considered only @xmath22 polytropes , which should be used only when convection dominates , we now allow variable polytropic index to include the transition to radiative transport ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "( 4 ) we include gravity as a heat source . in the later stages of accretion ,",
    "as the dm begins to run out and the star begins to contract , the gravitational potential energy is converted to an important power source .",
    "( 5 ) we include nuclear burning , which becomes important once the dm starts to run out .",
    "( 6 ) we include feedback mechanisms which can prevent further accretion .",
    "once the stellar surface becomes hot enough , again when the dm is running out , the radiation can prevent accretion .",
    "( 7 ) we include the effects of repopulating the dm inside the star via capture from the ambient medium .",
    "the result of this paper is that , for all the variety of parameter choices we consider , and with all the physical effects included , with and without capture , our basic result is the same . the final stellar mass is driven to be very high and , while dm reigns , the star remains bright but cool .",

    "2008 ; yoon et al . 2008 ; iocco et al . 2008 ; ripamonti et al .",
    "2009 ) has concentrated on the case of the pre - main - sequence , main - sequence , and post - main - sequence evolution of stars at fixed mass , in contrast to the present work , which allows for accretion from the dark - matter halo .",
    "we also cite previous work on dm annihilation in today s stars ( less powerful than in the first stars ) : krauss et al .",

    "at a given stage of accretion , the dark star has a prescribed mass .",
    "we make the assumption that it can be described as a polytrope in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium is defined by @xmath31 and by the polytropic assumption @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pressure , @xmath34 is the density , @xmath35 is the mass enclosed within radius @xmath36 , and the constant @xmath37 is determined once the total mass and radius are specified ( chandrasekhar 1939 ) .",
    "pre - main - sequence stellar models are adequately described by polytropes in the range @xmath38 ( fully convective ) to @xmath30 ( fully radiative ) . given @xmath33 and @xmath34 at a point , the temperature @xmath39 is defined by the equation of state of a mixture of gas and radiation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gas constant , @xmath42 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant , and the mean atomic weight @xmath44 .",

    "are used to determine the rosseland mean opacity @xmath53 from a zero - metallicity table from opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , supplemented by a table from lenzuni et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for @xmath54 k. the photosphere is defined by the hydrostatic condition @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "this point corresponds to inward integrated optical depth @xmath57 .",
    "when it is reached , the local temperature is set to @xmath58 and the stellar radiated luminosity is therefore @xmath59 where @xmath50 is the photospheric radius .",
    "the thermal equilibrium condition is @xmath60 where the total energy supply for the star ( see below ) is dominated during the ds phase by the dm luminosity @xmath61 .",
    "thus the next step is to determine @xmath61 from equation ( [ dmheating ] ) and from the density distribution of dark matter ( discussed in the next subsection ) .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath61 compared to @xmath62 , the radius is adjusted , and the polytrope is recalculated .",
    "the dark matter heating is also recalculated based on the revised baryon density distribution .",
    "the radius is iterated until the condition of thermal equilibrium is met .",
    "the value of the dm density inside the star is a key ingredient in dm heating .",
    "we start with a @xmath63 m@xmath19 halo composed of 85% dm and 15% baryons .",
    "we take an initial navarro , frenk , & white profile ( 1996 ; nfw ) with a concentration parameter @xmath64 at @xmath65 in a standard @xmath66cdm universe .",
    "we note at the outset that our results are _ not _ dependent on high central dm densities of nfw haloes .",
    "even if we take the initial central density to be a core ( not rising towards the center of the halo ) , we obtain qualitatively the same results of this paper ; we showed this in freese et al ( 2008b ) .",
    "_ enhanced dm density due to adiabatic contraction : _ further density enhancement is required inside the star in order for annihilation to play any role .",
    "paper i recognized a key effect that increases the dm density : adiabatic contraction ( ac ) . as the gas falls into the star , the dm is gravitationally pulled along with it .",
    "given the initial nfw profile , we follow its response to the changing baryonic gravitational potential as the gas condenses .",
    "paper i used a simple blumenthal method , which assumes circular particle orbits ( blumenthal et al . 1986 ; barnes & white 1984 ; ryden & gunn 1987 ) to obtain estimates of the density .",
    "subsequently freese et al . (",
    "2008b ) did an exact calculation using the young method ( young 1980 ) which includes radial orbits , and confirmed our original results ( within a factor of two ) .",
    "thus we feel confident that we may use the simple blumenthal method in our work . we found @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the gas density .",
    "for example , due to this contraction , at a hydrogen density of @xmath69/@xmath70 , the dm density is @xmath71 gev/@xmath70 . without adiabatic contraction ,",
    "dm heating in the first stars would be so small as to be irrelevant .    _ enhanced dm due to accretion : _ as further gas accretes onto the ds , driving its mass up from @xmath72 to many hundreds of solar masses , more dm is pulled along with it into the star . at each step in the accretion process , we compute the resultant dm profile in the dark star by using the blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1986 ) prescription for adiabatic contraction .",
    "the dm density profile is calculated at each iteration of the stellar structure , so that the dm luminosity can be determined .",
    "the continued accretion of dm sustains the dark star for @xmath73 years . then",
    ", unless the dm is supplemented further , it runs out , that is , it annihilates faster than it can be resupplied . at this point",
    "the @xmath6 dm halo has a tiny `` hole '' in the middle that is devoid of dm . one might hope to repopulate the dm by refilling the `` hole , '' but this requires further study . on a conservative note",
    ", this paper disregards this possibility . without any further dm coming into the star ( which is now very large ) ,",
    "it would contract and heat up to the point where fusion sets in ; then the star joins the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "this is one possible scenario which we examine in the paper .",
    "alternatively , there is another possible mechanism to replenish the dm in the dark star that may keep it living longer : capture .    _",
    "enhanced dm due to capture : _ at the later stages , the dm inside the ds may be repopulated due to capture ( iocco 2008 ; freese et al .",
    "this mechanism relies on an additional piece of particle physics , scattering of dm particles off the nuclei in the star .",
    "some of the dm particles bound to the @xmath6 dm halo occasionally pass through the ds , and if they lose enough energy by scattering , can be trapped in the star",
    ". then more dm would reside inside the ds and could continue to provide a heat source .",
    "this capture process is irrelevant during the initial stages of the ds , and only becomes important once the gas density is high enough to provide a significant scattering rate , which happens when the ds is already quite large ( @xmath74 ) . for capture to be significant ,",
    "there are two assumptions : ( 1 ) the scattering cross section must be high enough and ( 2 ) the ambient density of dm must be high enough .",
    "regarding the first assumption : whereas the existence of ds relies only on a standard annihilation cross section ( fixed by the dm relic density ) , the scattering cross section is more speculative .",
    "it can vary over many orders of magnitude , and is constrained only by experimental bounds from direct detection experiments ( numbers discussed below ) . regarding the second assumption : the ambient density is unknown , but we can again obtain estimates using the adiabatic contraction method of paper 1 .",
    "indeed it seems reasonable for the ambient dm density to be high for timescales up to at most tens - hundreds of millions of years , but after that the @xmath6 host for the dark star surely has merged with other objects and the central regions are likely to be disrupted ; simulations have not yet resolved this question .",
    "then it becomes more difficult for the ds to remain in a high dm density feeding ground and it may run out of fuel .",
    "we therefore consider two different situations : adiabatic contraction with and without capture ; i.e. , with and without additional capture of dm at the later stages . in the latter case",
    "we focus on `` minimal capture , '' where the stellar luminosity has equal contributions from dm heating and from fusion , as described further below . in both cases ,",
    "we find the same result : the dark stars continue to accrete until they are very heavy .",
    "the initial condition for our simulations is a ds of 3 m@xmath19 , roughly the mass where the assumption of nearly complete ionization first holds .",
    "we find an equilibrium solution for this mass , then build up the mass of the star in increments of one solar mass .",
    "we allow surrounding matter from the original baryonic core to accrete onto the ds , with two different assumptions for the mass accretion : first , the variable rate from tan & mckee ( 2004 ) and second , the variable rate from oshea & norman ( 2007 ) .",
    "the tan / mckee rate decreases from @xmath75 m@xmath76 at a ds mass of 3 m@xmath19 to @xmath77 m@xmath76 at 1000 m@xmath19 .",
    "the oshea / norman rate decreases from @xmath78 m@xmath76 at a ds mass of 3 m@xmath19 to @xmath79 m@xmath76 at 1000 m@xmath19 .",
    "the accretion luminosity arising from infall of material from the primordial core onto the ds is not included in the radiated energy .",
    "it is implicitly assumed to be radiated away in material outside the star , for example an accretion disk ( mckee & tan 2008 ) , and in any case , at the large radii involved here , this energy is small compared with the dm annihilation energy .",
    "we remove the amount of dm that has annihilated at each stage at each radius .",
    "we continue stepping up in mass , in increments of 1 m@xmath19 , until we reach 1000 m@xmath19 , the jeans mass of the core ( bromm & larson 2004 ) or until all of the following conditions are met : 1 ) the total mass is less than 1000 m@xmath19 , 2 ) the dark matter available from adiabatic contraction is used up ; 3 ) nuclear burning has set in , and 4 ) the energy generation from gravitational contraction is less than 1% of the total luminosity of the star .",
    "the last two of these conditions define the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the time step is adjusted for each model to give the correct assumed accretion rate .",
    "the final mass can be less than 1000 m@xmath19 because of feedback effects of the ionizing stellar radiation , which can reverse the infall of accreting gas ( mckee & tan 2008 ) .",
    "the feedback effect is included in an approximate manner , starting when the surface temperature reaches 50,000 k.    at the beginning of the evolution , the schwarzschild stability criterion for convection shows that the model is fully convective ; thus the polytrope of @xmath38 is a good approximation to the structure .",
    "however as more mass is added and internal temperatures increase , opacities drop and , once the model has reached about 100 m@xmath19 , radiative zones start to appear at the inner radii and move outward . beyond about 300 m@xmath19",
    "the model is almost fully radiative .",
    "the evolutionary calculation takes into account this effect approximately , by gradually shifting the value of @xmath80 up from 1.5 to 3 in the appropriate mass range . in the later stages of evolution ,",
    "the constant value @xmath30 is used .      the energy supply for the star changes with time and comes from four major sources",
    ": @xmath81 the general thermal equilibrium condition is then @xmath82 the contribution @xmath61 from adiabatically contracted dm dominates the heat supply first . its contribution been discussed previously and is given in equation ( [ dmheating ] ) . later , once the adiabatically contracted dm becomes sparse , the other effects kick in : gravity , nuclear burning , and captured dm .",
    "we discuss each of these contributions in turn .      at the later stages of evolution ,",
    "when the supply of dm starts to run out , the star adjusts to the reduction in heat supply by contracting . for a polytrope of @xmath30 , the total energy of the star is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total thermal energy and the radiation energy @xmath85 . using the virial theorem @xmath86 we eliminate @xmath84 from equation ( [ etot ] ) and obtain the gravitational contribution to the radiated luminosity @xmath87      once the star has contracted to sufficiently high internal temperatures @xmath88k , nuclear burning sets in . for a metal - free star",
    ", we include the following three energy sources : 1 ) the burning of the primordial deuterium ( mass fraction @xmath89 ) at temperatures around @xmath63 k , 2 ) the equilibrium proton - proton cycle for hydrogen burning , and 3 ) the triple - alpha reaction for helium burning . at the high internal temperatures ( @xmath90 k ) needed for the star to reach the zams , helium burning is an important contributor to the energy generation , along with the proton - proton cycle .",

    "the surface temperature @xmath58 remains at or below @xmath94 k. however once gravitational contraction sets in , it increases substantially , reaching @xmath95 k when nuclear burning starts . in this temperature range",
    ", feedback effects from the stellar radiation acting on the infalling material can shut off accretion ( mckee & tan 2008 ) .",
    "these effects include photodissociation of h@xmath7 , lyman @xmath96 radiation pressure , formation and expansion of an hii region , and photoevaporation of a disk .",
    "these effects become important at a mass of @xmath97 m@xmath19 in standard pop iii calculations of accretion and evolution , but the effect is suppressed until much higher masses in the dm case because of much lower @xmath58 . noting that 50 m@xmath19 on the standard metal - free zams corresponds to @xmath98 50,000 k ( schaerer 2002 )",
    ", we apply a linear reduction factor to the accretion rate above that temperature , such that accretion is shut off completely when @xmath99100,000 k. this cutoff generally determines the final mass of the star when it reaches the zams .",
    "the contribution @xmath100 is determined by calculating the annihilation rate of captured dm @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the density profile of captured dm .",
    "dm heating from captured dm has previously been discussed in detail by freese et al .",
    "( 2008c ) and iocco ( 2008 ) .",
    "the density profile of the captured dm has quite a different shape than the adiabatically contracted ( ac ) dm density profile discussed previously . whereas the ac profile is more or less constant throughout most of the star ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the captured dm profile is highly concentrated toward the center with an exponential falloff in radius , as we will now show .",
    "once dm is captured , it scatters multiple times , thermalizes with the star , and sinks to the center of the star .",

    "one can immediately see another difference with the ac profile : for captured dm the profile is more centrally concentrated for larger dm particle mass , whereas the density profile for adiabatically contracted dm is independent of particle mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath108 is the probability that a captured dm particle has thermalized with the star .",
    "@xmath110 @xmath111 is the time since a dm particle has been captured and @xmath112 is the thermalization time scale of captured dm .",
    "captured dm does not immediately thermalize with the star ; it requires multiple scatters .",
    "the thermalization time scale for the dm is @xmath113 as previously discussed in freese et al .",
    "( 2008c ) .",
    "here @xmath114 is the escape velocity from the surface of the star , @xmath115 is the average stellar density of hydrogen , and @xmath116 is the proton mass . we have only considered spin - dependent scattering , which includes scattering off hydrogen with spin 1/2 , but not off helium which has spin 0 .",
    "heating from captured dm is unimportant until the star approaches the ms ; the thermalization time scale is very long ( millions of years ) and @xmath117 .",
    "once the dm supplied from adiabatic contraction runs out , the star begins to contract , and the thermalization time scale becomes very short , on the order of a year .",
    "thus , the star rapidly transitions from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "the dm is either in thermal equilibrium or it is not . with this in mind , @xmath111 has been set to @xmath120 for all of the simulations .",
    "only @xmath121 is recalculated at every time step , which is a reasonable prescription ; @xmath111 set between a few thousand years and a few years makes no quantitative difference upon the evolution of the ds .",

    "once the star goes onto the main sequence , the maximum number is reached and @xmath126 .",
    "we can now give an explicit expression of @xmath109 by solving for the total number of particles @xmath122 bound to the star .",

    "we obtain the same essential results . while one can see in figure [ fig : f4 ] that there is some scatter of the basic properties of the star , yet we find the following general results for all cases : ds evolution occurs over an extended period of time ranging from @xmath191 years .",
    "all cases have an extended radius @xmath192 , are cool ( @xmath19310,000 k ) for much of the evolution , and have a large final mass @xmath194 .",

    "the figure shows the evolution for various particle masses with the tan / mckee accretion rate , and compares the 100 gev case with a calculation using the oshea / norman accretion rate .",
    "the ds evolution curves on the hr diagram are qualitatively similar for all of the different cases .",
    "the ds spends most of its lifetime at low temperatures below 10,000 k. eventually , dm begins to run out , the star contracts and heats up , and gravity and nuclear burning begin to turn on .",
    "just at the point where all three power sources are important , the luminosity `` flashes '' ( as seen in fig .",
    "2 ) , i.e. , increases by a 50 % for about 20,000 years and then goes back down .",
    "then , dm runs out . for the lower particle masses , as seen in fig .",
    "1 , the luminosity drops slightly as gravity becomes the main and dominant power source .",
    "as the surface temperature continues to increase , nuclear burning becomes important when @xmath198 k. above this temperature ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the stellar luminosity again increases as the star approaches the zams . above 50,000 k ,",
    "feedback effects turn on and begin to stop the accretion of baryons .",
    "once the star reaches 100,000 k , accretion completely stops , and the star goes onto the zams .    while the basic ds evolution is similar for all cases , we now discuss the variation due to different parameters .",
    "the evolution curves differ depending upon the dm particle mass . for larger @xmath10 ,",
    "the stellar mass and luminosity decrease such that the evolution curve on the h - r diagram for the 1 tev case is beneath that for the 100 gev case .",
    "the reduced luminosity is a consequence of the reduced energy production at the higher particle masses , since dm heating is inversely proportional to @xmath10 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) ) . then at higher particle masses a smaller radius is needed to balance the dark - matter energy production and the radiated luminosity .    in the tables and in figure 3",
    ", one can see the density profiles of the various components in the ds .",
    "the dm densities also depend upon @xmath10 . as shown in the tables , the average dm density in the star is an increasing function of @xmath10 .",
    "for example , at the time the ds reaches 100 @xmath2 , the central dm densities vary between @xmath199 for @xmath200 and @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "these densities are many orders of magnitude lower than the baryon densities in the ds , as can be seen in figure 3 . here",
    "one can see  the power of darkness : \" despite the low dm densities in the star , dm annihilation is an incredibly efficient energy source since nearly all of the particle mass is converted to heat for the star .",
    "we also wish to point out that both baryon and dm densities in the ds are far lower than in metal free main sequence stars of similar stellar mass ; zams stars have densities @xmath203 gm/@xmath70 .",
    "one can also see the dependence of the ds evolution upon accretion rate .",
    "our canonical case , obtained using the accretion rate from tan & mckee ( 2004 ) , can be contrasted with that using the oshea / norman accretion rate . for 100 gev particles ,",
    "the ds evolution is identical for the two accretion rates until @xmath204 k ( 10@xmath205 yr ) .",
    "after that the luminosity of the oshea / norman case shoots higher as a result of the higher accretion rate .",
    "consequently the ds with the oshea / norman accretion rate has a shorter lifetime than the ds with the tan / mckee accretion rate ( 350 vs. 400 thousand years ) ; a larger final mass ( @xmath206 vs. @xmath207 ) and higher luminosity .",
    "the 1 gev case displays some interesting behavior : one can see a spike in the evolutionary track on the h - r diagram .",
    "the ds reaches a maximum luminosity of @xmath208 and then subsequently drops by a factor of nearly ten , crossing beneath the 100 gev case .",
    "subsequently the 1 gev curve then again crosses the 100 gev case before settling onto the ms .",
    "the large early luminosity is due to extreme effectiveness of dm heating for the 1 gev case ; dm heating is inversely proportional to @xmath10 ( eq . [ eq : e1 ] ) .",
    "the stellar structure of all of the cases studied is similar to our canonical case , but the transition from a convective to a radiative structure happens at different times , depending upon the dm particle mass .",
    "the lower right panel in fig .",
    "4 plots the temperature gradient in the innermost few zones at the center of the ds , to show the onset of radiative energy transfer at the center of the star .",
    "models above the line have convective cores while models below have radiative cores .",
    "as we increase the dm mass , the onset of radiative transport happens earlier , at lower stellar masses . for our canonical 100 gev case ,",
    "a small radiative zone appears when the mass of the ds reaches 50@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath202 case , however , does not begin to form a radiative zone until the mass is nearly @xmath209 . the larger radii and cooler internal temperatures , compared with the canonical 100 gev case , result in higher interior opacities , favoring convection .",
    "the timing of the transition from convective to radiative can be understood from the stellar structure . for @xmath10",
    "greater than the canonical case , the dm heating is less effective since it is inversely proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the star compensates by becoming more compact , thereby increasing the dm density and the internal temperature . in the relevant temperature range ,",
    "the opacity scales as @xmath210 , and @xmath34 scales as @xmath211 .",
    "the smaller radius actually results in a decrease in luminosity as well , so the radiative gradient @xmath212 is reduced , tending to suppress convection relatively early .",
    "conversely if @xmath10 is less than @xmath213 , the star must be more puffy , which increases the radiative gradient .",
    "thus the transition will occur at a later stage .",
    "the cases studied have some differences in terms of lifetime , luminosity , and final mass . at the time",
    "the ds has grown to @xmath171 , the 1 gev case is an order of magnitude brighter than the 100 gev case .",
    "similarly , the 100 gev case is about an order of magnitude brighter than the 10 tev case .",
    "the ds lifetime grows shorter for increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the lifetime for the 1 gev case is @xmath214 years while the lifetime for the 10 tev case is only @xmath215 years .",
    "the reduced amount of fuel available in the 10 tev case more than compensates for the lower luminosity in determining the lifetime .",
    "also , the 1 gev case has a higher final mass than the 10 tev case ( @xmath216 vs @xmath217 ) ; clearly a longer lifetime allows more mass to accrete .",
    "here we discuss the evolution of the ds once its dm fuel begins to run out . in this section , we do not consider capture ; in the next section we will add the effects of capture as a mechanism to refuel the dm inside the star .",
    "initially , as baryons accrete onto the ds , adiabatic contraction pulls dm into the star at a sufficiently high rate to support the star , but eventually , adiabatic contraction fails to pull in enough dm at high enough densities to support it .",
    "adiabatic contraction eventually fails for two main reasons .",
    "dm must be brought inside the star , first , to replace the dm which has annihilated away and , second , to support an ever - increasing stellar luminosity as the stellar mass increases due to accretion .",
    "in fact , an accretion rate that decreases as a function of time ( tan & mckee 2004 ) only compounds the problem , leading to a relatively shorter life span since even less dm is brought into the star . with an insuffient amount of dm at high enough densities ,",
    "the star must contract to increase the dm heating rate to match the stellar luminosity .",
    "the contraction leads to higher surface temperatures such that feedback radiative effects eventually shut off accretion altogether .",
    "as the star contracts , a large fraction of dm previously inside of the star ends up outside of the star .",
    "the star s contraction amounts to at least two orders of magnitude in radius , leaving a large fraction of the dm outside the star .",
    "thus dm annihilation accounts for only a fraction of the dm  lost \" from the star .",
    "for instance in the 100 gev case , only a fifth of the dm is lost due to annihilation ; the rest is  left outside \" .    the ",
    "left outside \" effect can be understood in a simple way .",
    "dm heating is mainly a volume effect as can be seen in figure [ fig : f3 ] . due to adiabatic contraction , @xmath218 does not scale perfectly with baryon density ( eq . [ eq : ac ] ) .",
    "for instance , the total amount of dm inside of star of fixed mass ( even without dm annihilation ) decreases as the radius of the star shrinks .    without a way to replenish the dm such as with capture",
    ", the ds will eventually run out of dm due to the combination of the  left outside \" effect and dm annihilation .",
    "the dm inside the ds can be replenished by capture .",
    "dm particles bound to the larger halo pass through the star , and some of them can be captured by losing energy in wimp / nucleon scattering interactions .",
    "we remind the reader that we have defined our case of minimal capture to have background dm density @xmath219 and scattering cross section @xmath149 chosen so that about half of the luminosity is from dm capture and the other half from fusion for the standard 100 gev case at the zams .    with capture ,",
    "the stellar evolution is the same as in the cases previously discussed without capture throughout most of the history of the ds .",
    "the contribution to the heating from capture @xmath100 only becomes important once dm from adiabatic contraction runs out .",
    "once this happens , gravity still initially dominates , but for the minimal capture case we have considered , @xmath100 is more important than @xmath220 until the star eventually reaches a new  dark \" main sequence , where the two contributions become equal . during this phase",
    "the star is more extended and cooler than without capture , which allows for more baryons to accrete onto the star once the first dark star phase driven by adiabatic contraction ends .",
    "however for the standard minimal case the final mass with capture is at most 1% larger than that without .    in a future paper",
    "we will consider the case of much higher capture rates than the minimal ones we have studied here .",
    "the capture rate depends on the ambient dm density in which the ds is immersed and on the wimp / nucleus scattering cross section .",
    "high ambient density could easily arise ; in fact the adiabatic contraction arguments applied to the ds from the beginning indicate that this is quite likely . on the other hand",
    ", the scattering cross section may be significantly lower than the current experimental bound adopted in our minimal capture case . in any case , with a sufficiently high capture rate , say two or more orders of magnitude higher than the minimal value considered here , the star can stay dm powered and sufficiently cool such that baryons can in principle continue to accrete onto the star indefinitely , or at least until the star is disrupted .",
    "this latter case will be explored in a separate paper where it will be shown that the dark star could easily end up with a mass on the order of several tens of thousands of solar masses and a lifetime of least tens of millions of years .",
    "we have followed the growth of equilibrium protostellar dark stars ( ds ) , powered by dark matter ( dm ) annihilation , up to the point when the ds descends onto the main sequence .",
    "nuclear burning , gravitational contraction , and dm capture are also considered as energy sources . during the phase when dark - matter heating dominates ,",
    "the objects have sizes of a few au and central @xmath221 k. sufficient dm is brought into the star by contraction from the dm halo to result in a ds phase of at least several hundred thousand years ( without dm capture ) . because of the relatively low @xmath58 ( 400010,000 k ) , feedback mechanisms for shutting off accretion of baryons , such as the formation of hii regions or the dissociation of infalling h@xmath7 by lyman - werner photons , are not effective until dm begins to run out .",
    "the implication is that main - sequence stars of pop .",
    "iii are very massive . regardless of uncertain parameters such as the dm particle mass , the accretion rate , and scattering , ds are cool , massive , puffy and extended .",
    "the final masses lie in the range 5001000 m@xmath19 , very weakly dependent on particle masses , which were assumed to vary over a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "one may ask how long the dark stars live .",
    "if there is no capture , they live until the dm they are able to pull in via adiabatic contraction runs out ; the numerical results show lifetimes in the range @xmath222 to @xmath223 yr .",
    "if there is capture , they can continue to exist as long as they reside in a medium with a high enough density of dark matter to provide their entire energy by scattering , capture , and annihilation .",
    "in addition , the properties of the dm halo affect the nature of the ds .",
    "for instance , a larger concentration parameter allows for more dm to be pulled in by adiabatic contraction .",
    "the additional dm prolongs the lifetime of the ds phase and increases the ds final mass . the canonical case with a concentration parameter c @xmath224 rather than x @xmath225 has a final mass of 870 @xmath226 vs. 779 @xmath226 and has a lifetime of 442,000 yrs vs. 387,000 yrs .",
    "furthermore , the concentration parameter of each ds halo will be different , depending upon the history of each halo .",
    "thus the initial mass function ( imf ) of the zams arising from the growth of dark stars will be sensitive to the halo parameters .",
    "this effect will be studied thoroughly in a separate publication .",
    "ds shine with a few @xmath227 and one might hope to detect them , particularly those that live to the lowest redshift ( @xmath228 in the most optimistic case ) .",
    "one may hope that the ones that form most recently are detectable by jwst or tmt and differentiable from the standard metal - free pop .",
    "iii objects .",
    "ds are also predicted to have atomic hydrogen lines originating in the warmer photospheres , and h@xmath7 lines arising from the infalling material , which is still relatively cool .    the final fate of ds once the dm runs out is also different from that of standard pop iii stars , again leading to different observable signatures .",
    "standard pop iii stars are thought to be @xmath29 , whereas ds lead to far more massive ms stars .",
    "heger & woosley ( 2002 ) showed that for @xmath229 , pair instability supernovae lead to odd - even effects in the nuclei produced , an effect that is not observed .",
    "thus if pop iii.1 stars are really in this mass range one would have to constrain their abundance .",
    "instead , we find far more massive dark stars which would eventually become heavy main sequence ( zams ) stars of 500 - 1000 @xmath2 .",
    "heger & woosley find that these stars after relatively short lifetimes collapse to black holes . or , if they rotate very rapidly , ohkubo et al ( 2006 ) argue that they could become supernovae , leaving behind perhaps half their mass as black holes . in this case",
    "the presumed very bright supernova could possibly be observable . in either case , the elemental abundances arising from pair instability sn of standard pop iii ( less massive ) stars are avoided so that one might avoid the constraint on their numbers .",
    "other constraints on ds will arise from cosmological considerations . a first study of their effects ( and those of the resultant ms stars ) on reionization",
    "have been done by schleicher et al .",
    "( 2008a,2008b ) , and further work in this direction is warranted .",
    "the resultant black holes from ds could be very important .",
    "ds would make plausible precursors of the @xmath230 black holes observed at @xmath231 ( li et al .",
    "2007 ; pelopessy et al . 2007 ) ; of intermediate mass black holes ; of black holes at the centers of galaxies ; and of the black holes recently inferred as an explanation of the extragalactic radio excess seen by the arcade experiment ( seiffert et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , see alvarez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who present caveats regarding the growth of early black holes .",
    "in addition , the black hole remnants from ds could play a role in high - redshift gamma ray bursts thought to take place due to accretion onto early black holes ( we thank g. kanbach for making us aware of this possibility ) .    in the presence of prolonged capture , the ds could end up even larger , possibly leading to supermassive stars that consume all the baryons in the original halo , i.e. , possibly up to @xmath232 stars .",
    "the role of angular momentum during the accretion must be accounted for properly and will affect the final result ; in fact , even for the @xmath233 case studied in this paper , we intend to examine the possible effects of angular momentum .",
    "this possibility will be further investigated in a future publication ( in preparation ) , both from the point of view of the stellar structure , as well as the consequences for the universe .",
    "we acknowledge support from : the doe and mctp via the univ .  of michigan ( k.f . ) ; nsf grant ast-0507117 and gaann ( d.s . ) ; nsf grant phy-0456825 ( p.g . ) .",

    "<S> we have proposed that the first phase of stellar evolution in the history of the universe may be dark stars ( ds ) , powered by dark matter heating rather than by nuclear fusion , and in this paper we examine the history of these ds . </S>",
    "<S> the power source is annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which are their own antiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> these wimps are the best motivated dark matter ( dm ) candidates and may be discovered by ongoing direct or indirect detection searches ( e.g. fermi / glast ) or at the large hadron collider at cern . a new stellar phase results , powered by dm annihilation as long as there is dm fuel , from millions to billions of years . </S>",
    "<S> we build up the dark stars from the time dm heating becomes the dominant power source , accreting more and more matter onto them . </S>",
    "<S> we have included many new effects in the current study , including a variety of particle masses and accretion rates , nuclear burning , feedback mechanisms , and possible repopulation of dm density due to capture . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that in all these cases , we obtain the same result : the first stars are very large , 500 - 1000 times as massive as the sun ; as well as puffy ( radii 1 - 10 a.u . ) , bright ( @xmath0 ) , and cool ( @xmath110,000 k ) during the accretion . </S>",
    "<S> these results differ markedly from the standard picture in the absence of dm heating , in which the maximum mass is about 140 @xmath2 ( mckee & tan 2008 ) and the temperatures are much hotter ( @xmath350,000k ) </S>",
    "<S> . hence ds should be observationally distinct from standard pop iii stars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , ds avoid the ( unobserved ) element enrichment produced by the standard first stars . </S>",
    "<S> once the dark matter fuel is exhausted , the ds becomes a heavy main sequence star ; these stars eventually collapse to form massive black holes that may provide seeds for the supermassive black holes observed at early times as well as explanations for recent arcade data ( seiffert et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2009 ) and for intermediate mass black holes . </S>"
