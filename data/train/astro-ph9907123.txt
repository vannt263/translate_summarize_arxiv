    "the ionizing background that permeates intergalactic space is of fundamental interest for interpreting qso absorption lines and interstellar high - latitude clouds . produced primarily by quasars , seyfert galaxies , and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , these lyman - continuum ( lyc ) photons photoionize the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , set the neutral hydrogen fraction in the ly@xmath0 forest absorbers , and help to determine the ion ratios in metal - line absorbers in qso spectra .",

    "the hydrogen photoionization rate , @xmath21 , is an important component of n - body hydrodynamic modeling of the igm . because of the large photoionization corrections to the observed h  i absorption , the inferred baryon density of the igm and metal abundance ratios also depend on the intensity and spectrum of this radiation . within the milky way halo",
    ", the ionizing background can affect the ionization state of high - velocity clouds located far from sources of stellar radiation ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 ) .",
    "the ionizing background intensity at the hydrogen ionization edge ( @xmath22  ev ) is denoted @xmath23 , in ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 sr@xmath5 , hereafter denoted `` uv units '' or understood in context . in an optically thin environment ,",

    "the igm is optically thick , owing to the numerous ly@xmath0 absorbers that ionizing photons must traverse .",

    "theoretical extrapolations of @xmath23 to low @xmath35 are uncertain because they depend sensitively on the assumed agn luminosity function and on the igm opacity model ( giallongo , fontana , & madau 1997 ; fgs ) .",
    "as we will show , the low-@xmath35 igm opacity appears to be dominated by ly@xmath0 absorbers in the range @xmath36 , for which we are just starting to obtain statistically reliable information from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    ". a future key project on ly@xmath0 absorbers with hst and a ly@xmath37 survey with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) should be even more enlightening .",
    "observational estimates of or upper limits on @xmath23 at low redshift have been made by a variety of techniques , as described in table 1 .",
    "these methods include studies of the proximity effect at @xmath38 ( kulkarni & fall 1993 ) , edges of h  i ( 21 cm ) emission in disk galaxies ( maloney 1993 ; dove & shull 1994a ) , and limits on h@xmath0 emission from high - latitude galactic clouds ( vogel et al .",

    "therefore , better computations of the metagalactic radiation field are timely . in this paper , we compute the contribution of seyfert galaxies , qsos , and starburst galaxies to the low - redshift ionizing background using three ingredients : ( 1 ) a seyfert / qso luminosity function ; ( 2 ) agn fluxes at @xmath52   from extrapolated iue spectra ; and ( 3 ) an improved igm opacity model , based on recent hst surveys of ly@xmath0 clouds at low redshift . in ",

    "figure 1 illustrates our group s recent calculation of the ionizing background spectrum , computed in full cosmological radiative transfer with a new igm opacity model based on high - resolution _ keck _ spectra of the ly@xmath0 forest and local continua .",
    "these models include cloud self - shielding and emission .",
    "we have connected this high - redshift opacity model with our new model from hst studies ( discussed below ) for the low - redshift opacity at a transition redshift @xmath71 . by redshift @xmath1",
    ", the intensity has declined to @xmath72 , corresponding to @xmath73 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 for sources with @xmath74 .    in the work that follows ,",
    "we compute @xmath75 using both our detailed cosmological radiative transfer code and an approximate solution to equation ( 3 ) . in this approximation",
    ", we neglect the effects of emission from attenuating absorbers and approximate the opacity with a simple power - law fit that neglects the effects of he absorption .",
    "we will discuss the accuracy of this approximation in more detail in   3 . because the opacity of the igm is much smaller at low redshift",
    ", this more rapid calculation is adequate for estimating the present - day level of radiation just above @xmath76 .",
    "the primary ingredients for the computation of @xmath23 at low redshift are the source emissivity , @xmath54 , and the opacity model for @xmath77 . in the following sub - sections ,",
    "we describe how we determined these quantities .      the distribution of agn luminosities is typically described by a rest - frame , b - band luminosity function .",
    "in order to estimate the total emissivity of agn at the lyman limit , we must know both the luminosity function and the average spectrum of the agn .",
    "in addition , we must know the assumptions about the spectrum that were made to construct the luminosity function .    to estimate the intrinsic agn quasar spectrum , we begin with the seyfert optical sample of cheng et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , based on seyfert 1 and 1.5 galaxies covered by the first nine markarian lists .",
    "their sample was corrected for incompleteness , and the contribution from the host galaxy was subtracted out .",
    "the separation of nuclear and host galaxy luminosity becomes increasingly challenging at the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "ideally , careful , small - aperture photometry would be used for these estimates .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "( 1985 ) relied instead on two independent methods to separate the contribution from the nucleus . in the first method",
    ", they assumed a template host galaxy and corrected this for orientation and internal extinction . in the second method",
    ", they assumed that all nuclei had the same intrinsic colors and determined the nuclear contribution via the color - given method of sandage ( 1973 ) .",
    "they found these two methods to give consistent results .",
    "in addition , they compared the color - given method with nuclear magnitudes derived by careful surface photometry for 11 seyfert 1 galaxies ( yee 1983 )",
    ". they assigned a total uncertainty of @xmath78 mag in the nuclear @xmath79 to the sample . on re - examination of the sample",
    ", we found that the errors most likely decrease with the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we assume that the errors on the specific luminosity , @xmath80 ( ergs s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 ) , decrease linearly from 0.24 dex at @xmath81 to 0.16 dex at @xmath82 .    from this sample of seyferts , we chose 27 objects observed repeatedly by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) satellite . together with many other agn , these seyfert galaxies are part of the colorado iue - agn database ( penton , shull , & edelson 1996 ) , which gives both mean and median spectra",
    "since these agn are subject to flux variability , the distribution in flux is a skewed distribution with a tail that includes short flares studied by various iue campaigns . to provide a conservative estimate of the ionizing fluxes",
    ", we have therefore used median spectra to derive correlations ; however the differences in the correlations are only a few percent .",
    "the line - free regions of the median iue spectra were fitted to power - law continua and extrapolated to 912   ( rest - frame ) , from which we derive the specific luminosity , @xmath83 ( ergs s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 ) .",
    "we also convert from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , at @xmath84 hz ( 4400  ) by the formula derived from weedman ( 1986 , eqs .",

    "this agrees quite well with the average qso spectrum derived by zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",

    "however , the intensity estimates from these models differ by up to @xmath115 ( see fgs ) .",
    "this points to substantial uncertainties in the pei fit that are not reflected in the small formal errors .",
    "we integrate the ionizing luminosity density over the luminosity function from @xmath116 to @xmath117 . in our standard model ,",
    "we assume that these limits are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , and we explore the sensitivity of the results to @xmath116 .",
    "if we define @xmath120 , we can write the comoving specific volume emissivity as @xmath121 where we assume an euv power - law spectral index @xmath122 for the agn and integrate from @xmath123 to @xmath124 . with @xmath125 and @xmath126 ,",

    ", we find an empirical scaling relation , @xmath130 .",
    "to better assess the uncertainty from the extrapolation to bright and faint sources , we use figure 2 of pei ( 1995 ) , which shows the range of b luminosities that contribute to the luminosity function fit .",
    "we define the `` completeness '' as the integral of the emissivity over this range , compared with the integral for the standard range @xmath131 .",
    "this completeness rises from 20% at @xmath113 to 80% at @xmath132 , but falls to 20% at @xmath133 .",
    "the low-@xmath35 results can be made more robust by considering additional surveys of seyferts and qsos .",

    "( 1997 ) for seyferts and qsos with @xmath134 .",
    "these results are also compatible with the results of the local optical luminosity function based on an x - ray selected sample of agn ( della ceca et al .",
    "there are some discrepancies , however , between these results and the pei luminosity function .",
    "there are more qsos at the bright end of the luminosity function at @xmath135 than in the pei form , an effect that has been noted by several authors ( goldschmidt et al .",
    "1992 ; goldschmidt & miller 1998 ; la franca & cristiani 1997 ) . this appears to have its origin in systematic errors in the schmidt & green ( 1983 ) qso survey .",
    "in addition , there appears to be a slight deficit at the knee of the pei function in both the khler et al .  and cheng et al .",
    "in fact , the khler results are fitted adequately with a single power law , as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    it turns out that these two effects cancel to within @xmath136 when we compute the total b - band emissivity over the range @xmath137 .",
    "however , the fact that the luminosity function appears to be changing shape weakens the assumptions leading to the pei function , and the convergence at the faint end becomes even slower .",
    "hence , our best estimate of the emissivity is unchanged from the pei ( 1995 ) model , but we suspect that there are still substantial uncertainties in the agn luminosity function . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the emissivity from the pei `` open '' model . to find a reasonable range of emissivity models ,",
    "we multiply ( or divide ) this by the square root of the `` completeness '' of the pei model as derived above , and we also change the spectral slope @xmath91 and its dependence on @xmath80 by one standard deviation to minimize ( or maximize ) the ionizing emissivity .",
    "we consider the band thus defined to be a conservative 1@xmath138 range for the emissivity .",
    "note that the pei `` closed '' model , adjusted for the different spectral index and cosmology , lies well within this range .",
    "the average uv qso spectrum derived by zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) implies an euv spectral index @xmath25 for radio - quiet qsos and @xmath139 for radio - loud quasars",
    ". since radio - quiet qsos are much more numerous , we select @xmath140 as a representative measure of the euv spectral index .",
    "the contribution of stars within galaxies to the ionizing background remains almost completely unknown at all epochs .",
    "it has been realized ( cf .",
    "madau & shull 1996 ) that the amount of ionizing photons associated with the production via supernovae of the observed amount of metals in the universe might easily exceed the ionizing photons produced by agns .",
    "the problem has been to estimate the average fraction , @xmath141 , of ionizing photons produced by o and b stars that escape the galaxies into the igm .",
    "thus far , observational limits on @xmath141 exist from only a few nearby galaxies ( leitherer et al .  1995 ; hurwitz et al .  1997 ) . on theoretical grounds , dove & shull ( 1994b ) concluded that an escape fraction of order 10% might be possible , while more recent models of the escape of ionizing photons through supershell chimneys ( dove , shull , & ferrara 1999 ) suggest fractions of 36% , which are compatible with the observational limits .",
    "recently , bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999 ) used measurements of h@xmath0 from the magellanic stream to infer an escape fraction @xmath142 6% from the milky way .",
    "deharveng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argued that even the present indirect upper limits on @xmath23 must limit the present - day escape fraction to below 1% .",
    "they depart radically , however , from the work of dove & shull ( 1994b ) and dove et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in their treatment of the nature of the escape fraction .",
    "deharveng et al .",
    "assume that stellar ionizing photons are prevented from escaping their host galaxies by the opacity of neutral hydrogen , effectively in the limit that the hydrogen forms an unbroken sheet .",
    "consequently , the opacity varies approximately as @xmath143 , so that the escape of higher - energy photons is dramatically enhanced .",
    "for example , the optical depth can decrease from @xmath144 at the lyman edge to @xmath145 at 4 rydbergs .",
    "for photons emitted at high redshift that survive to contribute to @xmath23 at @xmath1 , the sharp increase in the escape fraction outweighs the effects of redshifting . in the deharveng picture , the contribution of high-@xmath35 galaxies to the present - day mean intensity at @xmath146 is strongly enhanced .",
    "thus , if @xmath147 , starbursts may match the contribution of quasars to the present - day ionizing mean intensity .",
    "however , we believe the deharveng model for photon escape is physically unrealistic .",
    "our alternative view is that the internal galactic opacity to all stellar photons is large , and photons may only escape from isolated regions of high star formation whose h  ii regions or attendant supershells are able to break through this high opacity layer ( dove et al .",
    "1999 ) . within this view , a constant escape fraction with frequency is more appropriate .",

    "as @xmath122 is varied between 1.5 and 2.1 , representative of the 2 @xmath138 uncertainty in @xmath122 , the relative specific intensity varies by @xmath224 about the standard value @xmath11 .",

    "this introduces a small uncertainty of 0.01 dex in the calculation of @xmath23 .",
    "the uncertainty inherent in our choice of opacity model , assumption ( 3 ) above , appears primarily in the degree of igm attenuation of ionizing photons .",

    "we therefore assign an uncertainty of @xmath247 dex .    as shown in fig .",
    "8b , the contribution from stars at @xmath229 to the present ionizing radiation background just above the lyman edge is less than 3% .",
