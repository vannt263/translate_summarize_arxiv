    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are often surrounded by circumstellar dust shells .",
    "the chemical composition of these media reflects that of the stellar photosphere .",
    "thus , carbon - rich grains , such as amorphous carbon ( a.c . ) , are one of the expected components of the dust envelopes around carbon stars .",
    "in addition , almost all these stars show an emission feature around 11.3@xmath2 m due to silicon carbide ( sic ) grains which are also condensed there . the existence of sic grains in the atmospheres of carbon stars was predicted at first on the basis of chemical equilibrium calculations by gilman ( 1969 ) .",
    "this prediction was supported by the observations of hackwell ( 1972 ) , treffers & cohen ( 1974 ) and forrest et al .",
    "( 1975 ) . nowadays",
    "infrared satellites provide several characteristic features of these grains .",
    "after the observations with iras satellite , several works have dealt with the classification of dust envelopes around carbon stars .",
    "little - marenin et al .",
    "( 1987 ) have discovered 176 new carbon stars using the feature at 11.3@xmath2 m as a selection factor .",
    "willems ( 1987 ) has analyzed 304 such objects , suggesting a sic - index to the stars which present the emission feature varying between 11.211.6@xmath2 m .",
    "papoular ( 1988 ) has classified carbon dust envelopes using the 11.3@xmath2 m feature and a secondary feature at 8.6@xmath2 m .",
    "the sample of chan & kwok ( 1990 ) was composed of 356 objects which were classified in two distinct classes . according to the authors ,",
    "the difference between the classes is due to an evolution of @xmath0-sic and @xmath1-sic particles .",
    "more recently sloan , little - marenin & price ( 1998 , hereafter slmp ) proposed a classification of 89 carbon - rich stars in 6 different types based on their infrared emissions .",
    "all stars of their sample show the sic feature at 11.3@xmath2 m .    in general , differences between each class can be interpreted as an evolution of the dust envelope itself due to an increasing amount of grains",
    "; consequently , optical depth also increases , affecting radiative transfer and the emission feature . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonance features of small sic grains are very sensitive to size , morphology and chemical composition of impurities in the surrounding medium ( bohen & huffman 1998 ) .",
    "this fact suggests that the variety of emission features assigned to sic grains is probably related to the formation process of the dust in circumstellar envelopes , reflecting the physical and chemical conditions .",
    "the classification criteria cited above are useful , but if one is interested in a deeper insight into the nature of the circumstellar dust grains , it is necessary to solve the radiative transfer problem , and to reproduce the features seen in the mid - ir lrs together with the overall behavior of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "several authors have calculated the radiative transfer in circumstellar dust shells ( cds ) of carbon stars ( chan & kwok 1990 ; lorenz - martins & lefvre 1993 , 1994 ; groenewegen 1995 ; bagnulo , 1996 ; bagnulo , doyle and andretta 1998 ) .",
    "lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1994 ) have employed the monte carlo method for solving the radiative transfer for two species simultaneously .",
    "sic grains were supposed to form closer to the star than graphite grains ( mccabe 1982 ) .",
    "correlations between sic / a.c . ratio and extinction opacity as well as",
    "sic / a.c . ratio and period of luminosity were found .",
    "these correlations indicate that the quantity of sic grains relative to amorphous carbon grains decreases with carbon star evolution .",
    "mass loss from cool stars is the major source of refractory grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "carbon stars provide carboneous material and extreme carbon stars , with their large mass - loss rate , are the main contributors . a study by whittet et al .",
    "( 1990 ) shows that there is a low fraction ( @xmath3 5% ) of si in the form of sic in the interstellar medium .",
    "the enrichment rate for a kind of grain depends on the composition of the dust envelopes of stars which have high mass - loss rate .",
    "lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1994 ) also suggested that sic grains are the minor component in carbon star envelopes .",
    "in addition , stars which have low sic / a.c . ratios ( 0.010.06 ) have also high mass - loss rates ( 1.5.@xmath4  irc+10216  6.1.@xmath5 @xmath6  iras 15194 - 5115 ) .",
    "these results can perhaps explain the small quantity of sic grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "alternatively , the weakness of the sic absorption could be due to the fact that sic particles are embedded in thick carbon mantles .",
    "in fact , kozasa et al . (",
    "1996 ) have shown that the nucleation of sic precedes that of carbon grains and may lead to the formation of dust grains consisting of a sic core and a carbon mantle .",
    "moreover they proposed that such core / mantle grains are the most reasonable candidates to reproduce the feature seen around 11.3@xmath2 m .",
    "they also suggested that radiative transfer calculations should be used in order to verify this model .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to present dust envelope models considering core / mantle grains composed by an @xmath0-sic core and an a.c .",
    "we also compare the data with models consisting of @xmath0-sic and a.c .",
    "homogeneous grains .",
    "two samples of stars have been considered .",
    "the first one contains objects classified by slmp .",
    "they were analyzed aiming to verify the classification proposed by the authors .",
    "the second sample contains 11 extreme carbon stars , which have thicker dust envelopes and a higher mass loss rate .",
    "the utilization of core / mantle grains is satisfactory to describe some stars but most of them are better reproduced using a two homogeneous grains model .",
    "besides carbon grains of different structures ( e.g. , graphite , amorphous carbon ) , sic is the most important species for late - type carbon stars .",
    "sic is one of the most refractory materials that may condense under the conditions of a carbon - rich chemistry . in such stars ,",
    "almost all oxygen is chemically blocked in the co molecule and , among the more abundant chemically active elements , carbon and sic are the possible condensates . an important problem in the formation of sic under the conditions present in circumstellar shells is that the abundance of sic molecule is quite low .",
    "beck ( 1992 ) has considered non - equilibrium effects and has shown that solid sic can be stable against evaporation at temperatures below 1400k .",
    "he also suggested that sic may form on the surface of preexisting carbon grains instead of being the primary condensate at very high temperatures .",
    "on the other hand , mccabe ( 1982 ) has shown that sic particles can be formed at high temperatures due to the greenhouse effect . following this suggestion , kozasa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have demonstrated that the nucleation of sic grains always precedes that of carbon grains when the non - lte effect , i.e. , the difference between the temperature of gas and small clusters , is taken into account .",
    "we have considered this latest suggestion and modeled 45 envelopes of carbon stars using core / mantle grains consisting of a @xmath0-sic core and a a.c .",
    "the method employed is an improved version of that described by lorenz - martins & arajo ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have modified the code to include a new option about grain properties .",
    "the absorption and scattering efficiencies , as well as the albedo , were calculated using the mie theory for core / mantle grains ( e.g. bohren & huffman , 1984 ; hoyle & wickramasinghe , 1991 ) and optical constants ( or dielectric functions ) tabulated in the literature . the optical constants which we have used are the ones determined by pegouri ( 1988 ) for @xmath0-sic , and by rouleau & martin ( 1991 ) for amorphous carbon .",
    "the propagation of stellar and grain radiative energy is simulated photon by photon following a monte carlo scheme . for each interaction between a `` photon '' and a grain , a fraction of the energy",
    "is stored ( absorption ) and the remaining part is scattered according to the scattering diagram .",
    "the stellar radiation leads to an initial distribution of dust temperature and the thermal radiation from grains is simulated , giving after several iterations the equilibrium temperature .",
    "computations give the spectral repartition of the total flux and of its different components ( direct , scattered , emitted ) , and the temperature law for the grains . for more details",
    "see lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1993 , 1994 ) and lorenz - martins & arajo ( 1997 ) .",
    "slmp have studied 89 carbon - rich stars and organized the dust emission in several classes . _",
    "red _ class contains only 3 stars which present a 11.3@xmath2 m feature and a strong dust continuum . _",

    "indeed , goebel , cheeseman & gerbault ( 1995 ) have suggested @xmath0:c - h , as described by dischler , bubenzer & koidl ( 1983 ) .",
    "unfortunately , they have not published the set of optical constants to this component . in order to try to reproduce the 8 - 9@xmath2 m emission ,",

    "bagnulo , doyle & andretta ( 1998 ) have shown that this feature can be reproduced by a dust shell composed of a mixture of sic grains and silicate grains .",
    "this interpretation , however , does not seem to be consistent with the theory of dust formation . before discussing such results ,",
    "let us comment now on some alternatives that might be investigated .    on the basis of a simple model of circumstellar envelopes , kozasa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have proposed that the 11.3@xmath2 m feature could be attributed to small spherical core / mantle type grains ( composed by a @xmath0-sic core and a carbon mantle ) in most cases . in their calculations",
    "they have used optical constants for sic tabulated by choyke & palick ( 1985 ) , which peak at about 10.7@xmath2 m .",
    "in fact , using this set of constants , the emission produced by a core / mantle grain as proposed by them is about 11.3@xmath2 m , and almost all sources of the slmp sample could be fitted using a core / mantle grain code .",
    "this is no longer true when we use the constants proposed by pgouri ( 1988 ) , which peak at about 11.3@xmath2 m . in this case ,",
    "the emission is shifted to longer wavelengths , too .",
    "we have computed our models considering the constants by pgouri ( 1988 ) because the full treatment consisting of the kramers - kronig analysis has been taken into account .",
    "another possibility was raised by speck et al .",
    "( 1999 ) : they have fitted some carbon stars using @xmath1-sic grains .",
    "silicon carbide grains can be divided into two basic groups : @xmath0-sic if the structure is one of the many hexagonal or rhombohedral polytypes , and @xmath1-sic if the structure is cubic .",
    "@xmath1-sic feature occurs at about 0.4 @xmath2 m shortwards of that of @xmath0-sic .",
    "their results were obtained without the kbr correction and they determined that @xmath0-sic has an intense , broad band near 11.8@xmath2 m and @xmath1-sic peaks at 11.3 to 11.4@xmath2 m .",
    "silicon carbide grains found in meteorites have isotopic compositions that imply that most of these grains were formed around carbon stars .",
    "all studies to date of meteoritic sic grains have found them to be of the @xmath1-type ( bernatowicz 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath1-sic will transform into @xmath0-sic above 2100@xmath42c but the reverse process is thermodynamically unlikely .",
    "the results obtained by speck et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that there is an obvious predominance of the @xmath1-sic phase and that there is now no evidence for the @xmath0-sic phase at all .",
    "their sample contains _ sic _ , _ sic+ : _ , _ red _ and extreme carbon stars .",
    "however they do not solve the radiative transfer in these media .",
    "moreover , we should expect some difference between `` early '' and `` late '' carbon stars with regard to dust grains .",
    "unfortunately , the optical constants for @xmath1-sic were calculated in a short range of wavelengths , about 7 to 12 @xmath2 m . in this case , we need to adopt another set of optical constants at shorter wavelengths , where most of the stellar radiation is concentrated . with this assumption",
    "we can not prove that @xmath1-sic grains are responsible for the 11.3 @xmath2 m emission alone .",
    "slmp have suggested the following carbon - rich dust sequence : _ sic+ _ @xmath43 _ sic _ @xmath43 _ red_. the _ red _ sources are significantly cooler on average than the _ sic+ _ sources . following our results , _",
    "sic+ _ stars have thinner envelopes than _",
    "sic _ stars . temperatures of the central stars are very similar but there is a tendency to cooler temperatures in this sequence .",
    "best models were obtained with two homogeneous grains for both _",
    "sic+ _ and _ sic _ class .",
    "_ red _ stars were best described with core / mantle grains .",
    "as mentioned before , based on our results we suggest that our sample of extreme carbon stars contains _ sic _ and _ red _ stars . in this sample ,",
    "the thinner envelopes were best represented by two homogeneous grains models ( our e1 group ) while thicker ones by core / mantle grain models ( e2 group ) .",
    "the temperature of these stars are also cooler than in the _ sic+ _ class .",
    "these results suggest that the sequence proposed by slmp can be interpreted as an evolutionary scenario .",
    "moreover , it seems reasonable to include our sample of extreme carbon stars in such a scenario . in the beginning of the sequence , grains",
    "are mainly composed of @xmath0-sic and amorphous carbon ; with dust envelope evolution , carbon grains are coated in @xmath0-sic ones .",
    "( hence the emission is shifted to longer wavelengths ) .",
    "this phenomenon could perhaps explain the small quantities of sic grains observed in the interstellar medium .    concerning _ sic++ _ class stars ,",
    "slmp have proposed that they lie in a different evolutionary sequence , related to j - type carbon stars . in their sample , which contains 96 objects , only nine are j - type stars .",
    "two of them are classed in the _ sic++ _ class .",
    "one of us ( lorenz - martins 1996 ) have proposed that j - type carbon stars have an alternative evolutionary scenario which differs from that proposed for ordinary carbon stars .",
    "in fact , according to the results of the present paper , _",
