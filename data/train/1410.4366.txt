    "energy dissipation has become a severe bottleneck to the sustainability of any modern economy  @xcite . to address this issue , efficient energy transfer and the corresponding smart control and detection at nanoscale",
    "have created unprecedented opportunities and challenges  @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding and controlling energy transfer in low - dimensional systems is of significant importance not only in fundamental researches but also in practical applications  @xcite .",
    "the simplest paradigm of nanoscale energy transfer is the spin - boson model , regularly represented by a two - level system ( tls ) interacting with a single bosonic bath , which has the equilibrium state after long time evolution .",
    "it has been extensively investigated in quantum optics  @xcite , quantum dissipation  @xcite , quantum phase transition  @xcite , anomalous statistics  @xcite , etc . while for energy transport",
    "far from equilibrium , at least two baths should be included with thermodynamic bias ( e.g. temperature bias ) , as shown in fig .",
    "it results in the nonequilibrium spin - boson model ( nesb ) , given by @xmath0 where the tls is represented by spin matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the energy spacing and @xmath4 the tunneling strength between the tls .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the bosonic baths with @xmath6 creating ( annihilating ) one boson with energy @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 in the @xmath9th bath .",
    "the last term describes the spin - boson interaction with @xmath10 the coupling strength . in the long time limit ,",
    "the system reaches the nonequilibrium steady state ( with stable energy flow ) , rather than the equilibrium state as described in the single bath spin - boson model case .    from nesb ,",
    "the tls can manifest itself as excitons , impurity magnets , anharmonic molecules , cold atoms , low - energy band structures and spins . and",
    "bosonic baths can register as electromagnetic environments , lattice vibrations , luttinger liquid , magnons , and so on .",
    "hence , the nesb has already found widespread applications in fertile frontiers .",
    "particularly , in molecular electronics  @xcite nesb describes electronic transport through a molecular junction . in the donor - bridge - acceptor complexes , even if the bridged structure becomes long , such as proteins , the complexes can still reduce to the effective tls description by considering weak interactions of the bridge with the donor and acceptor  @xcite , which clearly illustrates that nesb can also describe large interesting systems . in phononics",
    "@xcite , nesb describes the phononic energy transfer in anharmonic molecular junctions  @xcite , and can be regarded as a special realization of the famous caldeira - leggett model  @xcite . in many - body physics , nesb describes the novel kondo physics and nonequilibrium phase transitions  @xcite . in spin caloritronics , nesb describes the nontrivial spin seebeck effects that pave the way for thermal - driven spin diode and transistor  @xcite . in quantum biology , nesb models the exciton transfer embedded in the photosynthetic complexes  @xcite .",
    "also , nesb describes electromagnetic transport through superconducting circuits  @xcite and photonic waveguides with a local impurity  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this generic model can be extended to one dimensional spin chains at ultra - low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of the wide range of applications of nesb , little is known about its underlying physics and the fundamental transfer mechanism . to explore energy transfer in nesb ,",
    "many approaches have been proposed , but each approach works with limitations and is unable to see the wood for the trees . typically , in the weak spin - boson coupling limit , the redfield master equation with second order perturbation applies and gives the resonant energy transfer and the additive contributions of separate baths  @xcite . while in the strong spin - boson coupling limit , the nonequilibrium version of the noninteracting - blip approximation ( niba ) equation applies and provides the off - resonant steady energy transfer and the non - additive picture  @xcite , which is usually based on the second order born approximation in the polaron framework .",
    "note the traditional niba of a single bath spin - boson model is consistent with the redfield scheme in the weak - coupling regime  @xcite , which is distinct from the niba results of the nesb that only apply in the strong - coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the negative differential thermal conductance ( ndtc ) , the nonequilibrium niba scheme claims its appearance in the strong coupling for nesb , whereas the redfield scheme predicts its absence in the weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "similar limitations between these two schemes also occur in the high order flux - fluctuations as well as in the geometric - phase - induced energy transfer  @xcite .     and @xmath11 respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig : fig01 ] [ fig1 ]    consequently , questions are raised : which scheme provides the correct picture to describe the energy transfer in nesb ? or both are correct but are just two different manifestations of the same physics under different conditions ?",
    "if so , what happens at the intermediate coupling regime ? to solve the long - standing challenge and answer these important questions , we propose a unified theory .",
    "although some numerical simulations have recently been carried out  @xcite , attempting to exactly calculate the energy transfer in nesb , they all have their own limitations or require expensive computations",
    ". moreover , numerical approaches may not provide clear physical insights to the underlying energy transfer mechanism .",
    "therefore , it is indeed crucial to develop a unified analytical theory in order to fully resolve the microscopic mechanism and uncover new physics of the energy transfer in nesb .    in this work ,",
    "we firstly present a nonequilibrium polaron - transformed redfield equation ( ne - ptre ) in sec .",
    "ii , which based on the fluctuation - decoupling method perturbs the spin - boson interaction in the polaron framework .",
    "this approach is capable of bridging the energy transfer pictures of nesb from weak to strong coupling regimes . in sec .",
    "iii , we clearly unravel the energy transfer in nesb as multi - boson processes , which are classified by the odd - even parity , with the sequential- and co - tunneling behaviors as two lowest order contributions . to further exemplify the power of our unified theory in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the analytical expression of energy flux that dissects the transfer processes systematically , and show that this unified flux expression reduces to the niba at strong coupling limit and to the redfield one at the weak coupling limit , respectively . in sec .",
    "v , we investigate ndtc and identify its absence over wide range of the temperature bias , even in the intermediate and strong coupling regimes , which corrects the previous observation of ndtc under the niba in the classical limit  @xcite . finally , the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we first apply the canonical transformation to obtain the transformed hamiltonian , which re - organizes the system - bath interaction beyond the billinear form .",
    "then , a non - equilibrium polaron - transformed based master equation is derived , which decouples the system - bath interaction non - perturbatively .",
    "based on the canonical transformation @xmath12 to the nesb hamiltonian at eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) , a new transformed hamiltonian is obtained as @xmath13 where the system - bath interaction is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 the collective momentum operator of bosonic baths .",
    "traditionally , many methods , including the niba  @xcite , directly treat the interaction @xmath16 as a perturbation .",
    "however , we note that generally @xmath16 can not behave as a perturbation due to the non - negligible expectation @xmath17 , except for weak inter - site tunneling or strong system - bath coupling . nevertheless , the fluctuation around the expectation @xmath18 can be safely treated by the second order perturbation , regardless of the tunneling and coupling strength .",

    "therefore , by means of the fluctuation - decoupling , the new system - bath interaction can be reliably perturbed regardless of the coupling strength .",
    "it should be noted that if we select the bosonic baths as the ohmic case @xmath38 , the renormalization factor expressed at eq .",
    "( [ eta1 ] ) will always approach to zero regardless of the system - bath coupling strength , and the expectation of the system - bath interaction at eq .",

    "fluctuation - decoupling is the key step , based on which we are able to apply various perturbative methods to proceed .",
    "here , we adopt the nonequilibrium polaron - transformed redfield equation and obtain ( see appendix [ sectiona ] ) @xmath40 + \\sum_{l = e , o}\\sum_{\\omega,\\omega_1=0,{\\pm}\\lambda}\\gamma_l(\\omega)[\\hat{p}_l(\\omega)\\hat{\\rho},\\hat{p}_l(\\omega_1)]+h.c .   , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the reduced density matrix for the tls in the polaron framework , @xmath42 is the energy gap of the renormalized tls in its eigenspace , and @xmath43 is the measuring projector in the eigen - basis obtained from the evolution of spin matrices @xmath44 .",

    "we note that r. j. silbey and his colleagues have applied a similar polaron - based master equation to investigate the coherent exciton dynamics  @xcite . however , the system they studied interacts with merely a single bosonic bath , i.e. the standard equilibrium spin - boson model . only with multiple baths , we are able to determine the underlying picture of energy transport through nesb to be resonant or off - resonant , additive or non - additive .",
    "more importantly , this ne - ptre provides us analytical solutions , which clearly demonstrate the energy transfer as multi - boson processes that are classified by odd - even parity .",

    "specifically , @xmath52 describes the processes involving odd boson numbers .",
    "the lowest order contribution is the sequential - tunneling [ see fig . [ fig2](a ) ] , expressed by @xmath53  @xcite , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the relaxation and excitation of the tls is influenced by the @xmath56 and @xmath57 baths separately , i.e. , additively .",
    "further , the higher order , called as `` tri - tunneling '' [ fig . [ fig2](b ) ] , is exhibited as @xmath58 , with @xmath59 for @xmath60 , where the baths act non - additively and off - resonantly .",
    "this highly non - trivial term explicitly demonstrates the collective transfer process with different contributions from two baths .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath61 describes processes of even boson number participating in the energy transfer processes .",
    "the lowest order includes the co - tunneling effect  @xcite [ see fig . [ fig2](c ) ] .",
    "it contributes to the transition rate as @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that when the left bath releases energy @xmath63 , the right bath absorbs the same quanta simultaneously , leaving the tls unchanged . clearly , two baths are involved non - additively .",
    "the corresponding higher order term can also be obtained systematically [ see fig . [ fig2](d ) ] . as a result",

    "the solid black line is from the ne - ptre , which unifies the redfield result at the weak coupling ( the red dashed line ) and the niba result at the strong coupling ( the dot - dashed blue line ) .",

    "physically , @xmath78 describes that when the tls releases energy @xmath75 by relaxing from the excited state to the ground one , the right bath absorbs energy @xmath79 and the left one obtains the left @xmath80 if @xmath81 or supply the compensation if @xmath82 .",

    "in many energy transfer studies , the resonant case ( @xmath66 ) is of the prime interest .",

    "ndtc , a typical feature in energy transport , has been extensively studied in phononic devices  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "ndtc has also been exploited in molecular junctions , represented by the nesb . by adopting nonequilibrium niba in the marcus limit , i.e. high temperature baths ,",
    "it was reported that ndtc is absent in the weak coupling but emerges in the strong coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "however , what happens at the intermediate coupling regime is unclear .",
    "moreover , it is questionable that whether ndtc is still presented in the comparatively low temperature regime .",
    "marcus theory was originally proposed to study semi - classical electron transfer rates in the donor - acceptor species  @xcite . in previous works of energy transport  @xcite",

    "@xcite . in the high temperature limit",
    ", it is known that @xmath115 and the low frequency domain of bosonic baths dominates the evolution , which corresponds to the short - time expansion @xmath116 and @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "thus the gaussian decay of the the probability density is given by @xmath118 $ ] , which is as the same as derived from eq .",
    "( [ proden1 ] ) even under biased condition .",
    "the renormalized coupling strength is @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the energy flux can be obtained accordingly with the help of counting field  @xcite . however , this limiting picture may be modified if the temperatures of bosonic baths become low , when the quantum effect will be included to make the probability density non - gaussian .",
    "therefore , we re - examine the ndtc by the ne - ptre in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a - c ) . in the intermediate coupling regime ( @xmath120 ) , the energy flux increases monotonically by enlarging the temperature bias ( @xmath121 ) , both for the ne - ptre and the niba of the classical ( marcus ) limit .",
    "as the coupling is strengthened further into the strong coupling regime ( i.e. @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) , ndtc is apparent at the marcus limit  @xcite .",
    "however , no turnover signal is found based on the ne - ptre . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", @xmath124 so that our method reduces to the niba , thus the discrepancy comes from the marcus approximation .",
    "it should be noted that from figs .",
    "[ fig4]b and [ fig4]c , the qualitative deviation occurs at the large temperature bias .",
    "this means that the temperature of the right bath is rather low , and quantum effect as such low temperatures may change behaviors of the correlation functions . to further clarify the absence of ndtc at the deep strong coupling regime , the birdeye view contours of energy flux",
    "are compared with and without marcus limit [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) and [ fig4](e ) ] .",
    "it is shown that the turnover behavior appears within the marcus framework , by tuning either @xmath125 or @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "4(d ) ) , whereas it never emerges with rigorous calculations [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) ] .",
    "in fact , this result clearly demonstrates that the ndtc in the marcus limit occurs at large temperature bias @xmath126 with either @xmath11 or @xmath125 at very low temperature , where the high temperature precondition of the marcus framework may break down .",
    "thus the ndtc observed in the niba scheme with marcus assumption is merely an artifact .",
    "hence , we conclude that by tuning one bath temperature , ndtc is absent across a wide range of the temperature bias in the nesb , even in the strong system - bath coupling limit .",
    "finally , we would like to note if we allow to change two temperatures simultaneously , ndtc can still occur in nesb .",
    "also , ndtc is not exclusive to the strong coupling limit generally , but can even exist in the weak coupling regime if the system is hybridized with fermion - spin - boson couplings  @xcite .",
    "by applying the nonequilibrium polaron - transformed redfield equation based on fluctuation decoupling , we have unified the energy transfer mechanisms in the nonequilibrium spin - boson model from weak to strong coupling regimes .",
    "specifically , we have characterized energy transfer as multi - boson processes that are classified by the odd - even parity .",
    "we have analytically obtained the energy flux expression in eq .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) , which explicitly unifies the analytic results from the weak - coupling redfield scheme and the strong - coupling niba scheme .",
    "moreover , enhancement of the energy flux at the intermediate coupling regime has been identified , which results from the persistence of coherent tunneling within the tls but is unexpectedly ignored in the nonequilibrium niba .",
    "other relevant limiting problems of energy transfer have also been systematically resolved .",
