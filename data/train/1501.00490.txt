    "wormholes are hypothetical handles or tunnels in spacetime linking widely separated regions of our universe or entirely different universes .",
    "morris and thorne @xcite proposed the following line element for the wormhole spacetime : @xmath0 using units in which @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is called the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to prevent an event horizon .",
    "the function @xmath3 is called the _ shape function _ , which has the property that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the _ throat _ of the wormhole .",
    "a key requirement is the _ flare - out condition _ at the throat : @xmath6 , while @xmath7 near the throat .",
    "the flare - out condition can only be satisfied by violating the null energy condition ( nec ) , which states that @xmath8 for all null vectors and where @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "so given the null vector @xmath10 , the nec is violated if @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy density and @xmath13 the radial pressure .    the possible existence of wormholes in the outer region of the halo has already been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite using the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the characteristic scale radius and @xmath16 is the corresponding density .",
    "this model yields a shape function whose basic properties , such as the throat size , remain the same in the region considered @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the nfw model predicts velocities in the central parts that are too low @xcite , but these discrepancies do not exist in the outer regions of the halo where the wormholes discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite are located @xcite .    in this study",
    "we are going to be primarily concerned with the region closer to the center where the universal rotation curve ( urc ) dark matter profile is valid @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the core radius and @xmath19 the effective core density . while the urc model is valid throughout the halo region , we assume that the outer region has already been dealt with in refs",
    ". @xcite using the nfw model , thereby leaving only the central region , which is the subject of this paper .    in this connection",
    "we would like to add here that the urc represents any single rotation curve in spirals of any mass and hubble type , and it is an obvious step forward with respect to assuming a constant value . at some time , a cored burkert profile is a step forward with respect to nfw profile that , it is now common fact that the latter fails to reproduce the dark matter distribution . both the urc and the cored profile are born empirically and find some explanation later on @xcite .",
    "therefore , our plan of the present work is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we provide the basic equations and their solutions under the urc dark matter profile whereas sec . 3 is devoted for some specific comments regarding the results obtained in the study .",
    "even though we now have the density profile , other properties of dark matter remain unknown .",
    "so we are going to assume that dark matter is characterized by the general anisotropic energy - momentum tensor @xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath13 being the transverse and radial pressures , respectively .",
    "the line element for the galactic halo region is given in eq .",
    "( [ e : line1 ] ) .    the flat rotation curve for the circular stable geodesic motion in the equatorial plane yields the tangential velocity @xcite @xmath23    the radius @xmath24 in kpc and velocity @xmath25 in km / s of the rotation curve of objects with total virial mass @xmath26 solar masses is given below ( table - 1 ) @xcite .",
    "we find the best fitting curve which is given in fig . 1 .    by applying intuition , we propose that the observed rotation curve profile in the dark matter region is of the form @xmath27.\\ ] ] for a typical galaxy the tangential velocity @xmath25 is shown in fig .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently large @xmath24 , @xmath28   250   km / s @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "one can note that our proposed curve and observed curve profile for tangential velocity are almost similar to each other for the specific values of the parameters i.e. the proposed and observed rotational velocities are both fittable with our empirical formula .",
    "therefore , our assumption is more or less justified .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     the einstein field equations for the above metric are @xmath30\\label{e : ein3}&=&8\\pi p_{t}(r).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eqs .",
    "( [ e : v1 ] ) and ( [ e : v2 ] ) and using some typical values , we obtain the redshift function    @xmath31    here @xmath32 is the exponential integral and @xmath33 is an integration constant . the graph of @xmath34 in fig .",
    "2 shows the behavior in the central part of the halo , which is the region that we are primarily concerned with .",
    "( for large @xmath24 , @xmath34 is such that @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of the shape function @xmath3 requires a little more care .",
    "first of all , we assume that @xmath37 , @xmath34 , and the halo have a common origin in order to use eqs .",
    "( [ e : v1 ] ) and ( [ e : ein1 ] ) in the calculations . to see if the shape function meets the basic requirements , we start with eq .",
    "( [ e : ein1 ] ) , @xmath38 and integrate from 0 to @xmath24 to obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an integration constant .",
    "to get an overview of the shape function , we assign some arbitrary values to the parameters and obtain the plots in fig.2 shows that the throat is located at some @xmath41 , where @xmath42 intersects the @xmath24-axis . also , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which implies that @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 is decreasing for @xmath46 , implying that @xmath6 .",
    "hence the flare - out condition is satisfied .",
    "so based on the urc model , the qualitative features meet all the requirements for the existence of a wormhole .    at this point",
    "it would be desirable to examine the effect of using more specific parameters .",
    "for example , if the throat of the wormhole coincides with the core radius @xmath47 , then we get for the shape function @xmath48 where @xmath49 as before , @xmath50 .",
    "having determined the throat radius allows a closer look at the flare - out condition , which again depends on @xmath51 . by eqs .",

    "( [ e : bprime ] ) , we get @xmath57 the flare - out condition is easily satisfied . notice that this result does not change if we adopt the milky way values for @xmath58 and @xmath18 found by the accurate analysis of @xcite    to complete our discussion , we will use eqs .",

    "3 , @xmath11 , so that the null energy condition is indeed violated .     for values of the parameters",
    "the possible existence of wormholes in the outer regions of the halo was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the nfw density profile . possible detection by means of gravitational lensing , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , has shown that the basic features , such as the throat size , are independent of the position within the halo . because of certain discrepancies discovered near the center , this paper uses the observationally motivated urc dark matter density profile instead in order to accommodate the region closer to the center of the halo .",
    "this center is also the center of the wormhole .",
    "it is subsequently shown that the solution obtained satisfies all the criteria for the existence of a wormhole , particularly the violation of the null energy condition . in the special case of the milky way galaxy , if the throat radius @xmath47 coincides with the radius of the core , then @xmath65 , thereby meeting the flare - out condition .",
    "a similar result can be expected for most spiral galaxies .",
    "thus our result is very important because it confirms the possible existence of wormholes in most of the spiral galaxies .",
    "scientists remain silent on whether it is possible to manufacture or create of the exotic matter violating null energy condition in laboratory . as a result",
    "the construction of a wormhole geometry in our real world is extremely difficult .",
    "however in the galactic halo region , dark matter may supply the fuel for constructing and sustaining a wormhole .",
    "hence , wormholes could be found in nature and our study may encourage scientists to seek observational evidence for wormholes in the galactic halo region .",
