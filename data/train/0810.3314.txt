    "it has been purposed that standard model ( sm ) particles live in the usual @xmath12-dimensional space , while gravity can propagate in a higher - dimension space @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is helpful to reduce the fundamental mass scale from the large plank scale down to be about @xmath13-scale and then to solve the so - called hierarchy problem , so it arouses people s interests since its first announcement .",
    "numerous attempts have been carried out to find the signal of the large extra dimension , i.e. measurements of gravity at short distances , studies of various astrophysical and cosmological implications of large extra dimension and collider searches for virtual and real graviton effects @xcite .",
    "the cern lhc , with its high collision energy ( @xmath14 tev ) and high luminosity ( @xmath15 ) , shall provide a better platform to study the extra - dimension phenomenology both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the leading experimental signal of real graviton at lhc is from the hadronic process @xmath0 with @xmath1 stands for the transverse missing energy .",
    "we shall present a detailed discussion on the hadronic production of graviton through the hard subprocesses : @xmath2 , @xmath16 and @xmath4 . by using the quantum gravity effective theory with large extra dimensions @xcite",
    ", we make a try to study the quantum gravity effects and its dependence on the number of extra dimension , and to study up to what energy scale can lhc probe .",
    "furthermore , main theoretical uncertainty for the graviton production shall be studied , which includes the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the initial partons , the choice of the factorization scale @xmath17 and the typical energy scale @xmath18 for the hard scattering amplitude , the number of the extra dimension for the graviton production , and etc ..    the processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 , followed by an invisible decay of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath21 , give an irreducible physical background to graviton production .",
    "we refer to these processes as the ` sm background ' .",
    "we will estimate the observability of the graviton signal by comparing its hadronic cross - section to that of ` sm background ' .",
    "there are other important background sources from miss - measured jets and @xmath22 production with forward leptons , however as argued in ref.@xcite that these backgrounds decrease sharply as the lower bound on missing @xmath23 is increased , so we shall not considered it here .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to give the main formulae for graviton production within the framework of the quantum gravity effective theory with large extra dimensions .",
    "numerical results and discussions are presented in section iii , where the uncertainties in estimates and a discussion on the value of the effective energy scale @xmath8 shall be presented .",
    "the last section is reserved for a summary .",
    "according to the qcd factorization formulae , the hadronic production of graviton at the collision center of mass energy @xmath24 can generally be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are pdfs of incoming hadrons @xmath28 ( momentum @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 ( momentum @xmath31 ) for parton @xmath32 ( with the momentum fraction @xmath33 ) and parton @xmath34 ( with the momentum fraction @xmath35 ) respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the ` characteristic energy scale of the subprocess squared ' ; and @xmath36 is the ` energy scale squared ' where the factorization about the pdfs and the hard subprocess is made .",
    "usually for leading order ( lo ) calculation to obtain the best results , the two scales @xmath36 and @xmath18 are carried out as the same , thus later on we take @xmath37 except one case when estimating the uncertainty from lo and the ambiguity of the choices about @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath38 stands for the differential cross - section of the relevant hard subprocess , in which @xmath39 is the center of mass energy of the subprocess and @xmath1 stands for the missing transverse energy . within the framework of the quantum gravity theory with large extra dimensions ,",
    "the differential cross - section for inclusive graviton ( g ) production , i.e. @xmath40 with @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath41 stands for corresponding partons , can be written as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 stands for the differential cross - section for producing a single kaluza - klein graviton of mass @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the surface of a unit - radius sphere in @xmath47 dimensions , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 integer , @xmath50 and for @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "for the present @xmath53 subprocesses , the mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "since the graviton interaction vertex is suppressed by @xmath57 , it can be found that @xmath58 , and the factor @xmath59 appearing from the phase - space summation exactly cancels the planck mass dependence in eq .",
    "( [ sigf ] ) . in another words ,",
    "the large phase space of the kaluza - klein modes , corresponding to the large volume of the compactified space , exactly cancels the dependence on @xmath60 and gives an effective interaction suppressed only by inverse powers of @xmath8 .",
    "this is the reason why sizable contributions from the graviton may be observed at lhc , and inversely , one can estimate to what energy scale can lhc probe . for the differential partonic cross - sections @xmath61 that produce a single kaluza - klein graviton with mass @xmath44",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath18 stands for the characteristic energy scale of the hard scattering amplitude , @xmath63 stands for the light quark @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , and the functions @xmath67 take the following form @xmath68.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relation @xmath69 is implicitly adopted that can be deduced from the fact of @xmath70 .",
    "it can be easily find that @xmath71 as is the requirement of the invariance under exchange of the mandelstam variables @xmath72 and @xmath64 .",
    "for the background subprocesses @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 , \\label{cszqg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath78 stands for the electric charge of @xmath63-quark .",
    "in the following , we shall first discuss the uncertainties in estimating the graviton/@xmath7 production . for the lo estimation",
    ", we shall concentrate our attention on the main uncertainties , which include the pdfs for the light quarks , the choice of the factorization scale @xmath79 and the typical energy scale @xmath18 for the hard scattering amplitude and the number of the extra dimension for the graviton production .",
    "the number of extra dimension ( @xmath47 ) can either be too small or too large .",
    "we are interested in the case in which @xmath47 is not too large ( say @xmath80 ) , under such condition the mass splitting @xmath81 is so small that the sum over the different kaluza - klein states can be replaced by a continuous integration , and then the enormous number of accessible kaluza - klein modes can rightly compensate the @xmath82 factor in the scattering amplitude .",
    "while an even larger number of extra dimensions shall lead to the mass splitting @xmath81 become comparable with the experimental energy resolution , hence only a smaller number of kaluza - klein modes can be produced , and then the total cross - section is negligible due to the unavoidable @xmath82 suppression . on the other hand , it is argued that @xmath47 can not be too small as is required by the latest torsion - balance experiment @xcite .",
    "constraints from cosmology also lead to non - trivial bounds on extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "so , we take @xmath83 $ ] to do study its effect to the hadronic production .    as is shown in eq.([cross ] ) , pdfs @xmath84 and @xmath85 generate certain uncertainties in the estimation .",
    "pdfs are of non - perturbative nature , and in eq.([cross ] ) they have been factorized out at the energy scale @xmath17 with the help of pqcd factorization theorem .",
    "the pdfs can be obtained only through global fitting of the experimental data and evolute them to the requested characteristic scale in standard way of pqcd , so there are several groups , e.g. cteq @xcite , grv @xcite and mrs @xcite etc , who devote themselves to offer accurate pdfs to the world , and to keep pdfs updated with the newly available relevant experimental data .",
    "thus in literature , different versions of pdfs ( including different issues by the same group ) are used in the estimates of the hadronic production . to be self - consistent with the lo pqcd calculation",
    ", we shall adopt the two lo pdfs : cteq6l @xcite and mrst2001l@xcite as typical examples for pdfs .",
    "the versions of the gluon distributions ended with ` l ' are accurate up - to the leading logarithm order ( llo ) , i.e. , their qcd evolution effects with @xmath86 running are included , so for the production to show the uncertainties correctly up to lo accuracy , it is necessary for the pdfs , the hard subprocess and the qcd ` coupling constant ' @xmath86 ` run ' to the energy scale @xmath18 properly .",
    "when computing the production and taking the pdfs from one version of the three groups , the running @xmath86 should also be taken from the same group .",
    "as for the leading order estimation , how to choose the energy scale @xmath18 is a very tricky problem .",
    "if @xmath18 is chosen properly , the results may be quite accurate .",
    "from experience , for a hard subprocess with two - body final state , generally the choice of @xmath87 can lead to an accurate lo result . to see the uncertainty caused by different choices of @xmath18",
    ", we take two typical types for @xmath18 , i.e. type @xmath88 : @xmath87 with @xmath89 the squared center of mass energy of the subprocess ; type @xmath90 : @xmath91 , the squared transverse mass of the graviton/@xmath7 respectively . and",
    "further more , to see the uncertainties from @xmath18 choice , instead of variation on the choices with @xmath92 , the authors in literature , such as ref.@xcite , also try @xmath93 and see the uncertainty . here following them , we also calculate the distributions with @xmath93 .",
    "more explicitly , as suggested in refs.@xcite , we take @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath95 $ ] simultaneously to do the discussion .",
    "other parameters like @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the fraction of @xmath7 decaying to invisible particles affect the production slightly , so we directly take them to be their center values as adopted in the literature , e.g. @xmath98gev , @xmath99 to be @xmath100 and the fraction of @xmath7 decaying to invisible particles like ( anti)neutrinos @xmath101 to be the center value of @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "another important thing we need to be careful is the regulation of the cross section to avoid the non - perturbative regime , i.e. to deal with the signatures arising from collisions with parton center - of - mass energies of order @xmath8 or above properly . at @xmath103 ,",
    "parton collisions are expected to produce classical black holes @xcite .",
    "as has been pointed out that the discrepancy between the two cases with or without the cut @xmath104 shall be increased with the increment of @xmath105 and decreased with the increment of @xmath8 @xcite , therefore by taking proper @xmath106 cut in experimental analysis , one can select different ranges of @xmath8 to probe perturbatively . and numerically",
    ", we can find that under the present conditions , with or without the cut @xmath104 shall affect our final conclusions slightly , so we shall adopt the cut @xmath104 in all the following discussions .       with an acceptance cut on the jet rapidity @xmath107 .",
    "the dash - dotted line is sm background , the solid , dashed and dotted lines are for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    firstly , we show the uncertainty caused by the different choice of extra dimensions @xmath47 . for the purpose ,",
    "we fix pdf to be cteq6l , @xmath111 , @xmath87 and @xmath37 .",
    "we show the signal and the background rates for the transverse jet energy larger than @xmath105 in fig.[dimension ] , with an acceptance cut on the jet rapidity @xmath107 .",
    "it is shown that the signal rates decrease with the increment of @xmath47 .",
    "the sm background is bigger than the graviton signal in the lower transverse jet energy region but it drops down much quickly than the signal , and one may distinguish the signal from the background in large transverse jet energy region . in another words , the large transverse jet energy region shall provide an effective platform to distinguish the signal and the background .",
    "with an acceptance cut on the jet rapidity @xmath107 .",
    "the thinner and thicker shaded bands stand for the sm background and the signal respectively , with the upper edge for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and lower edge for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    secondly , we show the uncertainty from different choices of @xmath18 and @xmath17 . for such purpose ,",
    "we fix pdf to be cteq6l , @xmath111 , @xmath116 .",
    "it is found that by taking two choices of @xmath18 ( type a and type b ) under the case of @xmath37 , the uncertainties for both the background and the signal are small , i.e. the differences between these two types of @xmath18 are less than 10% for both the background and the signal .",
    "further more , we show the case of @xmath117 by shaded band in fig.[scale ] , with an acceptance cut on the jet rapidity @xmath107 , where @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath95 $ ] . it is found",
    "the largest value is obtained when @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the lowest value is obtained when @xmath114 and @xmath115 . and from fig.[scale ] one may also observe that while the uncertainty for the background changes to be around @xmath119 ( as shown by the thinner shaded band ) , the uncertainty for the signal can be changed up to 50% ( as shown by the thicker shaded band ) .     with an acceptance cut on the jet rapidity @xmath107 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    it may be also interesting to make a discussion on the maximum @xmath8 sensitivity with smaller integrated luminosity , e.g. @xmath122 . under such case",
    "both symmetric and statistical errors are comparable , and now the criterions ( [ cr1],[cr2 ] ) are not applicable , so we adopt the criterion suggested by ref.@xcite to do the discussion , i.e. we add the two errors in quadrature and require @xmath123 the corresponding @xmath8 sensitivity ranges versus @xmath47 are shown in tab.[tab3 ] with lower integrated luminosity @xmath124 , where the cuts @xmath107 and @xmath125 tev are adopted and the errors are caused by the above mentioned main uncertainty sources that varies within their reasonable regions accordingly .",
    "it is found that with sufficient luminosity at lhc the fundamental gravity scale can be probed up to several tev , with the precise value depending on the number of extra dimensions . in the present paper , we have presented a detailed discussion on the leading experimental signal of real graviton at lhc based on the process @xmath126 with the help of the quantum gravity theory with large extra dimensions . the main standard model background to these processes together with their uncertainties",
