    "variation of optical / uv emission on timescales from hours to years is one of the defining characteristics of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "numerous previous studies of agn / quasar ensembles have shown that the variability amplitude is dependent on wavelength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , time lag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and yet has a large scatter . while it is generally believed that the optical / uv light is emitted from an optically thick accretion disk powered by a central massive black hole , the physical processes that produce its variability as observed are not understood yet .",
    "interestingly , recent progresses link the variability with some fundamental parameters of agn . a correlation of variability with",
    "was reported by @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found correlations of the variability with both luminosity ( inversely ) and , based on which the authors speculated that variability is inversely related to the eddington ratio ( ) .",
    "prominent line emission in the optical / uv band is another defining feature of agns .",
    "a set of strong correlations has been revealed to link the emission line properties , i.e.a narrow h@xmath0  line associated with strong optical , weak @xcite .",
    "these correlations form the so - called eigenvector 1 ( e 1 ) of agn , which is suggestively driven by some underlying , more fundamental physical parameters , most likely the eddington ratio @xcite .",
    "however , the relationship between the above two agn characteristics  the optical / uv variability and the emission line properties ( or e1)is poorly explored observationally so far .",
    "the same is true for the relation between the variability and the eddington ratio . in this letter ,",
    "we report our investigation on this issue , as the first result of our comprehensive studies of agn variability by making use of the valuable multi - epoch repeated photometric scanning of the stripe-82 region in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . one virtue of our study improving upon previous ones is the inclusion of agns with optical spectra characteristic of narrow - line seyfert1 ( nls1 ) , in addition to typical broad - line agns ( blagn ) of the broad - line seyfert1 ( bls1 ) type , whose variability has been extensively studied .",
    "the nls1-type agns extend to the extremes in the e1 space and to high  values .",
    "we use the @xmath1-dominated cosmology with @xmath2 70mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "our comprehensive study of agn optical / uv variability @xcite is carried out based on two comparative blagn samples , a bls1-type sample and a nls1-type sample , selected from the sdss data release 3 in the stripe-82 region .",
    "the procedure of optical spectral analysis for selecting blagns has been described in detail in our previous papers @xcite , and the nls1-type sample is taken from @xcite .",
    "the sample selection and photometric data analysis , including photometric calibration and measurement of variability , are described in detail in @xcite , and is only briefly summarized here .",
    "the sample selection criteria are : ( a ) located within the stripe-82 region ( ra @xmath6 310@xmath7 or @xmath8 59@xmath7 and -1.25@xmath7 @xmath8 dec @xmath8 1.25@xmath7 ) ; ( b ) redshift @xmath90.8 ( h@xmath0 present in spectra ) and the broad component of h@xmath0  or  detected at @xmath10 ; ( c ) classified as ` star ' in _ all _ of the five bands by the sdss photometric pipeline so as to eliminate the contamination from host galaxy starlight ; ( d ) non - radio - loud , so as to eliminate possible contamination from jet emission @xcite ; ( e ) a bls1- and nls1-type dividing line as the broad h@xmath11/h@xmath0 fwhm @xmath12 , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also gelbord et al .",
    "all of our nls1-type objects also meet the conventional /h@xmath0@xmath13 criterion for nls1s ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the above selections result in 58 nls1-type and 217 bls1-type agns . furthermore , since we aim at a comparative study of the bls1- and nls1-type , we require the two samples to have statistically compatible distributions on the redshift  luminosity ( @xmath14 ) plane . as the bls1-type agns largely outnumber the nls1-type ones , a subsample of the former",
    "is then extracted to mimic the @xmath14 distribution of the latter .",
    "we try to retain the nls1-type sample ( with only a few outliers discarded ) , and prune the bls1 sample by randomly selecting its objects falling within sub - regions divided on the @xmath14 plane , with a bls1/nls1 ratio consistent with 2:1 .",
    "this results in two final working samples , 55 nls1- and 108 bls1-type agns , which are statistically compatible on the redshift ",
    "luminosity plane [ figure[lum_z ] ; the 2-d kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite yields a chance probability of 0.43 that they have the same @xmath14 distributions ] .",
    "the two working samples consist of mostly quasars with @xmath15mag and @xmath160.30.8 .",
    "they can be considered as optically and homogeneously selected , with reliably measured continuum and emission line parameters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their physical parameters span almost the whole range of blagns with fwhm(h@xmath1710008000 , black hole mass = @xmath18 , luminosity ( @xmath19band ) @xmath20 , and the eddington ratio = 0.011 .",
    "the stripe-82 region was repeatedly scanned during the sdss - i phase ( 2000 - 2005 ) under generally photometric conditions and the data were well calibrated @xcite .",
    "this region was also scanned repeatedly over the course of three 3-month campaigns in successive three years in 20052007 known as the sdss supernova survey ( sn survey ) . in this work we use the photometric data obtained during the sdss ",
    "i phase from data release 5 ( dr5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sn survey during 2005 .",
    "we use the psf magnitudes .",
    "observations in the sn survey were sometimes performed in non - photometric conditions . at the time",
    "when this work was started only the un - calibrated source catalogs were available .",
    "thus we need to calibrate out possible photometric ` zero - point ' offsets in the sn data against the dr5 magnitudes , using stars in the same fields as ` standards ' .",
    "the photometric calibration is performed field - by - field for each of the sn survey fields ( 100arcmin@xmath21 patches ) in which our sample objects locate .",
    "` standard stars ' with good measurements ( high quality photometry ) are selected following the recommendations of the sdss instructions .",
    "the differential magnitudes of the calibrating stars ( 50@xmath22200 in numbers ) between the sn survey and dr5 observations ( @xmath23 ) are calculated , and their weighted mean is set to zero , @xmath24 . in this way the zero - point offsets of the sn survey photometry are determined , which have ( systematic ) uncertainties @xmath80.01mag _ relative to the reference dr5 data _ for all the fields .",
    "the total systematic errors of the calibrated sn survey photometry are thus the quadratic sum of the above item and those of the dr5 photometry @xcite",
    ". the overall ( systematic and statistical ) photometric errors of the calibrated sn survey magnitudes have a median of @xmath25mag for the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 bands , and @xmath29mag for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands , which are comparable to those in the dr5 data .",
    "the reliability of our photometric calibration can be demonstrated by examining the calibrated sn survey data of the 14 landolt photometric standard stars @xcite locating in stripe-82 ; none of them is found to show detectable variability .",
    "for each of the objects there are typically @xmath2227 observations ( 14 from the sn survey during 2005 ) spanning @xmath225 years ( see figure[lightcurve ] for an example lightcurve ) .",
    "the optical variability is commonly measured by the variance of observed magnitudes , with the contribution due to measurement errors subtracted ; the intrinsic amplitude @xmath32 is given by the square root of this variance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt a formalism similar to that used in @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the weighted mean , and @xmath35 here the contribution to the variance due to measurement errors @xmath36 is estimated directly from the errors of observed individual magnitudes @xmath37 ( including both the statistical and systematic errors ) , as @xmath38 rather than that in @xcite where a fitted error relation from a large sample was used .",
    "such an estimation of @xmath36 was also used in @xcite , though in the flux rather than magnitude domain .",
    "we approximate the derived amplitude  for a filter band as that at its effective wavelength @xmath39 . for an object of redshift @xmath31",
    ", @xmath39 corresponds to a wavelength @xmath40 in the object s rest frame .",
    "thus for each object the variability at five rest wavelengths are sampled which correspond to the five sdss bands .",
    "we find that the long - term variability with amplitudes greater than @xmath410.05mag ( approximately the minimum amplitude detectable in this work ) is ubiquitous in our agns .",
    "the previously known strong dependence of the amplitude on ( rest - frame ) wavelength is also detected . to eliminate this effect in the following analysis",
    ", we divide the whole rest wavelength range sampled here , 19007100 , into five bins of equal bin - size in @xmath42 ( see table[correlation ] ) , and treat the variability in each bin separately . in a few objects where more than one measurement falling into one wavelength bin , the averaged  values is used for that bin .",
    "we find that , although the wavelength dependence is negligible within a wavelength bin , large scatters of variability clearly remain ( see figure[correlation_e1 ] ) .",
    "of particular interest , we find that nls1-type agns have systematically lower variability than bls1-type agns in all the five wavelength bins , which are moderately significant ( using the student s _",
    "t_-test for the sample means yields probability levels of 0.0010.01 ) .",
    "a question is : what causes the large diversity of the variability , or what controls the variability amplitude ?",
    "it is well known that large scatters in some of the agn observables can be reduced when the set of eigenvector1 correlations are considered , in which agns lie continuously with nls1-type clustering at one end .",
    "below we extend these correlations to including variability amplitude .",
    "correlations are tested between the variability amplitude and several well known e1 parameters , namely , h@xmath0  fwhm , the relative strength of the  and  emission lines .",
    "the latter two are measured by the intensity ratios to h@xmath0 , i.e. @xmath43@xmath44 ( where the total flux of h@xmath0  is used ) and @xmath45@xmath46 ( where  @xmath47 denotes the multiplets flux integrated over 44344684 , and h@xmath48 the flux of the broad component of h@xmath0 ) . the non - parametric spearman rank statistic is used .",
    "the correlations are tested for the combined bls1- and nls1-type agn sample as well as for each sample separately .",
    "the results are summarized in table[correlation ] , with the spearman s coefficient @xmath49 and the two - tailed probability for the null hypothesis of no correlation .",
    "figure[correlation_e1 ] shows the data in",
    "_ one _ of the wavelength bins as examples .    for the combined agn sample in all the wavelength bins",
    ", there exist moderate yet interesting correlations between the variability and the three e1 parameters , which are statistically significant .",
    "the smaller the h@xmath0  linewidth is , the weaker the [ oiii ] and the stronger the  emission , and the smaller the variability amplitude . among them ,",
    "the strongest correlations are those with the feii strength @xmath50",
    "( @xmath51 ) , followed by those with fwhm(h@xmath0 ) , while those with @xmath52 are the weakest .",
    "some of the correlations still remain significant even when the two samples are considered separately .",
    "it is thus clear that the large scatter in the optical / uv variability as observed can , at least to some extent , be attributed to the distribution of agn across the e1 parameter space .",
    "our finding of the lower ensemble variability of nls1- compared to bls1-type agns is just a manifestation of these correlations , for the former have smaller linewidths by definition and generally weaker [ oiii ] and stronger  emission than the latter .",
    "given such significant and interesting correlations , we suggest that the e1 correlations may be extended to those involving the variability in the optical / uv band .      there have been suggestions that the underlying driver of the e1 correlations is most likely the eddington ratio @xcite .",
    "here we test the dependence of the variability on   explicitly .",
    "we also examine the variability dependence on luminosity and , as claimed in previous studies .",
    "are estimated using the scaling relation given in @xcite from the broad h@xmath0  fwhm and the 5100  luminosity ( @xmath53 ) , which are taken from or measured in the same way as in @xcite . to calculate  the bolometric luminosities are estimated as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the results of the correlation tests are listed in table[correlation ] , and the data in the 2500 - 3300  bin are demonstrated in figure[correlation_mass_edd ] as an example .    of particular interest ,",
    "the strongest correlation is an inverse correlation of the variability with ( @xmath55 ) , which is the case for all the wavelength bins .",
    "the correlation is present in not only the combined bls1- and nls1-type agn sample but also the individual samples separately , although it is only marginal in the nls1-type sample alone ( possibly due to its narrow  range ) .",
    "these correlations are as strong as the above @xmath50 correlation .",
    "in addition , the combined two samples also show a positive correlation between the variability and black hole mass , though it is considerably weaker compared to that with . for luminosity ( @xmath53 used here ) , however , there is essentially no significant correlation found in all the wavelength bins except 25003300 , in which a weak inverse correlation may be marginally present ( @xmath56 ) .    since  appears to correlate with  in our samples ( as commonly found in optically selected agn samples with a limited luminosity range ) , one or both of their correlations with the variability may not be as significant as it appears to be , or one may even be spurious and induced from the other .",
    "we try to eliminate this possible effect of the third variant using the partial spearman correlation test ( see the last two columns in table[correlation ] for results ) .",
    "we first re - examine the correlation between  and  by taking into account their respective correlations with .",
    "it turns out that , in all the wavelength bins , the correlations with  vanish when the dependence on  is taken into account .",
    "however , the same treatment for the relation , with the effect of  eliminated , still yields significant , though somewhat reduced , inverse correlations in three wavelength bins .",
    "we thus conclude that the correlation is genuine , regardless of the   correlation .",
    "the latter , as apparently seen in the data and previously reported @xcite , is consistent with being induced from the former .",
    "it is intriguing that the optical / uv variability is closely related to the agn e1 parameters .",
    "this can be understood in light of the same interesting correlations with the eddington ratio , also found here , provided that  is indeed the underlying driver of the e1 correlations .",
    "since the variability  correlation is significant enough for the bls1-type sample alone without including nls1-type , our result does not rely on the  ( thus ) estimation for nls1-type agns , which is still somewhat controversial .",
    "the fact that the correlations of the variability with the e1 parameters and are as strong as those among the e1 parameters and  themselves suggests that the e1 correlations may be extended to those involving the optical / uv variability .",
    "the correlation between the variability and , though also present in our data , turns out to be insignificant when  is taken into account .",
    "we thus suggest that such a correlation , as claimed in recent studies @xcite , might be spurious and induced from the variability-  relation . the previously known variability ",
    "luminosity inverse correlation is found to be insignificant or at most weak in our data .",
    "this may be partly due to the fact that our analysis is capable of recovering agns ( some are nls1-type ) with small variability in the low luminosity regime ( see figure[correlation_mass_edd ] ) which were largely missed in previous work for various reasons .",
    "however , our morphology and redshift cuts restrict both the luminosity and  ranges of our samples , which are important for comparisons with previous work . for example",
    ", @xcite have shown that a factor of 100 change in luminosity corresponds to a factor of 4 change in variability .",
    "thus it can not be ruled out that the lack of significant dependence on either luminosity or  may be due to their limited ranges in our samples .",
    "the ensemble weaker variability of nls1- compared to bls1-type agns , as evidently found here and also suggested by @xcite based on a small sample , is simply a natural consequence of the correlations with the e1 parameters and the eddington ratio . the dependence on  can be understood qualitatively in terms of decreasing variability with increasing radius of the accretion disk , independent of the actual physical processes that drives the variability .",
    "such radius - dependent variability is suggested by the fact that the variability amplitude increases as wavelength decreases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the context of thermal disk model .",
    "as the accretion rate @xmath57 ( in units of the eddington rate ) increases , the continuum emission region that dominates a given waveband moves outward to a larger radius @xmath27 ( in units of the schwarzschild radius ) because of @xmath58 ; and hence decreasing variability is expected .",
    "we note that such a trend of optical variability seems at odds with that in the x - ray band @xcite , though in the x - ray case more convincing results are needed .",
    "the different behavior may result from the different mechanisms and emitting regions of the radiation , as well as different variability mechanisms , in the two bands ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our finding of the strong correlations of the variability with the e1 parameters and  imposes interesting constraints to agn variability models .",
    "foremost , this indicates that the optical / uv variability must be intrinsic to agn activity ; any external scenarios , such as gravitational microlensing @xcite , multiple supernovae and star collisions @xcite , can be ruled out as the dominant process . for intrinsic variability models ,",
    "it is not clear whether the mechanism causing variability is some minor , secondary effect or related to the main energy generation process , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "our result favors the latter since the eddington ratio is directly related to the mass accretion rate of agn at a given accretion efficiency .",
    "the correlation with  as found here suggests that the accretion disk most likely plays a critical role in producing the observed opitcal / uv variability , since the disk structure is depending on the mass accretion rate .",
    "for instance , the model proposed by @xcite that the variability is caused by change of accretion rates can reproduce _ qualitatively _ the observed inverse variability  relation ( li s. , private communication ) .",
