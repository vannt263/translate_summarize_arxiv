    "the population of near - earth objects comprises small bodies , both comets and asteroids , covering a wide range of dynamical parameters and physical properties .",
    "this variety suggests that the members of the population are a mixture of bodies of different origin and evolution . the dynamical lifetime of near - earth asteroids ( neas ) , which constitute the majority of the near - earth object population , is typically of the order of @xmath5  yrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is significantly shorter than the age of the solar system .",
    "therefore , the existence of the nea population implies that there must be sources of replenishment in order to maintain the observed population .",
    "source regions of neas have been identified to lie mostly within the asteroid main belt and the transport mechanisms into the nea population are well understood @xcite .",
    "comets have long been suspected of not only supplementing the cometary component of the near - earth object population , but also its asteroidal component , the neas @xcite .",
    "comets are objects from the outer regions of the solar system that harbor ices and have been perturbed by the gravitation of the giant planets into orbits that bring them into the inner solar system . from the dynamical viewpoint , there are two major populations of comets : long - period comets with periods @xmath6  yr and short - period comets with periods @xmath7  yr .",
    "short - period comets have low inclinations and interact strongly with jupiter @xcite ; their near - ecliptic orbits and short periods strongly suggest an origin in or near the kuiper belt , most probably in the scattered disk and centaur populations @xcite .",
    "the orbits of long - period comets are nearly isotropically distributed in inclination and have high eccentricities , indicating an origin in the oort cloud @xcite .",
    "most halley - type comets have periods @xmath8  yr and can be considered the short - period tail of the long - period comets @xcite .",
    "their origin is still subject to debate ; models suggest an origin in the kuiper belt @xcite or the oort cloud @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we will focus on the discussion of short - period comets in the near - earth object population , the short - period near - earth comets ( necs ) .",
    "as comets approach the sun , the increased amount of insolation results in a rise of their surface temperatures .",
    "sublimation of near - surface volatiles causes the development of cometary activity in the form of a coma and a tail .",
    "@xcite found that the most likely activity lifetime of short - period comets is @xmath9  yr , which is significantly shorter than the average dynamical lifetime of short - period comets ( @xmath10  yr , * ? ? ? * ) and neas ( @xmath5  yr , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , comets that have spent a significant amount of time in near - earth space are likely to have ceased their activity , becoming `` dormant '' or `` extinct '' comets that are indistinguishable from low - albedo asteroids @xcite . however , this is only one possible fate of comets .",
    "observations have shown that comets can break up into smaller fragments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or , as recently observed in comet c/2012",
    "s1 ( ison ) , disrupt entirely .",
    "results by @xcite , however , suggest that at the end of the active lifetime of short - period comets they are likely to become dormant rather than to disrupt .",
    "@xcite estimate that 78% of all short - period comets are extinct .",
    "additionally , there may be dormant comets that presently appear asteroidal but could once again have a cometary appearance .",
    "examples include nea 4015 wilson - harrington , which displayed cometary activity in 1949 , but never since @xcite , and nea 3552 don quixote , which was found to show cometary activity nearly 30 years after its discovery as an asteroid @xcite .",
    "don quixote has been considered an extinct comet @xcite , but it is more adequate to describe it as a dormant comet , since it is not clear if its activity is persistent and feeble or episodic .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the general term dormant comets , since it is not clear if all of these objects are actually extinct .",
    "dormant comets in the nea population , just like active comets , have impacted earth and are likely to have contributed to the deposition of water and organic materials on its surface ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the determination of the physical properties and the fraction of dormant comets in the nea population is important in order to understand the formation and evolution of the solar system and life on earth .",
    "comets are directly linked to the outer regions of the solar system , which contain the most pristine objects .",
    "since neas are among the most easily accessible objects in space , dormant comets in near - earth space provide us with the unique opportunity to retrieve and study potentially volatile - rich cometary material for future resource utilitzation .    in this work ,",
    "we present a search for dormant comets that have an origin as short - period comets based on a statistical analysis and an estimation of their fraction in the nea population .",
    "we base our analysis on the largest sample of physically characterized neas available to date .",
    "we identify dormant comet candidates in the nea population using two different statistical approaches that are based on the dynamical and physical ensemble properties of known asteroids and comets . in our first approach , we identify objects with comet - like orbits , utilizing the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , @xmath11 , and the minimum orbit intersection distance with respect to jupiter , @xmath12 . in our second approach",
    "we use @xmath11 and the aphelion distance , @xmath13 , to identify objects on comet - like orbits . from both samples , we then identify `` dormant comet candidates '' as objects with low , comet - like albedos .",

    "the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter is defined as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination of the target body , respectively , and @xmath27 is the semimajor axis of jupiter @xcite .",

    "we adopt the measured albedo uncertainty ( see table [ tbl : sample ] ) as the 1@xmath111 uncertainty , and in the case of the absolute magnitude , we adopt a 1@xmath111 uncertainty of 0.2  mag , which is based on results by @xcite . from 100 trials with varied physical properties , we find that 0.33.3% ( 1@xmath111 confidence interval ) of the nea population with @xmath116 can be considered dormant short - period necs .",

    "we conclude that @xmath1100 neas with diameters of 1  km or more are dormant comets .",
    "we note that these estimates differ significantly .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to two different effects . due to the albedo - dependence of the absolute magnitude and the wide range of albedos in the nea population ,",
    "high - albedo neas are over - represented in the magnitude - selected sample .",
    "hence , one would expect a smaller fraction of dormant comets in the magnitude - selected sample , compared to the size - selected one .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the latter of which is more shallow due to the disintegration of small cometary objects with low perihelion distances .",
