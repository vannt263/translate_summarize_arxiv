    "over the last decade a widespread and extended diffuse component of ionized hydrogen contributing 2550% to the total h@xmath9 flux has been found well outside of classical regions in several face - on and edge - on galaxies ( e.g. , lehnert&heckman @xcite , rand @xcite , greenawalt et al .",
    "@xcite , or dettmar @xcite ) .",
    "although there is significant evidence that the presence of the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( dig , sometimes also called warm ionized medium , wim ) is correlated with ongoing star formation in the disk ( e.g. , dettmar @xcite ) , important aspects of its ionization and excitation are not well understood . while of all conventional ionizing sources only uv radiation of massive stars provides sufficient power to keep these thick gas layers ionized ( including the reynolds - layer of the milky way ( reynolds @xcite ) ) the resulting photoionization models have to explain the long mean free paths for the uv photons and the observed emission line ratios .",

    "@xcite , rand @xcite ) cause a problem for pure photoionization models and an additional heating contribution , e.g. from the kinetic energy provided by supernova , is likely ( dahlem et al .",

    "unreddened line ratios can be computed by assuming an average interstellar extinction curve and adopting @xmath53 as nebular reference emission line .",
    "the extinction can be determined from the measured balmer decrement .",
    "it is assumed that such a correction is negligible for the remaining line ratios because only pairs of emission lines in the red spectral region had been chosen which are located in a narrow wavelength region ( @xmath57 ) so that differential reddening is not significant .",

    "in extragalactic objects basically four different ionization mechanisms can be clearly distinguished .",
    "firstly `` normal '' photoionization by o stars which is present mainly in regions ( star forming regions ) .",
    "secondly shock ionization present in objects which are excited by supernova remnants ( snr ) or by superwinds .",
    "finally we can also distinguish between photoionization by extremely hot stars such as the central stars of planetary nebulae and objects which are photoionized by a power - law continuum source ( agn ) . to probe the ionization mechansism(s ) of the extraplanar",
    "dig it is useful to plot line ratios by pairs on a logarithmic scale ( baldwin et al .",
    "@xcite , veilleux&osterbrock @xcite ) . since the above mentioned mechanisms produce characteristically different spectra , all objects cover different locations when plotted into a single diagnostic diagram .",
    "in order to verify our findings obtained from line ratios and diagnostic diagrams we examined also the broadening of line widths at extraplanar latitudes .",
    "therefore we plotted a kinematical diagnostic diagram ( line ratio vs. line width ( fwhm ) ) which indicates the presence of additional excitation mechanisms , such as shocks or stellar winds .",

    "the scatter in [ ] / [ ] ( fig .",

    "15 or 16 ) reveals only a relatively flat gradient towards the halo .",
    "this result differs extremely from the one for ngc1963 or ngc3044 , and is similar to the ratio found for ngc891 .",
    "it also indicates that none of our selected models can predict correct values , especially not for the most extreme points in this plot .",
    "it could be argued that diluted and very soft radiation is responsible for the observed values .",
    "however , this is not probable since [ ] should be increased , too .",
    "haffner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown for the milky way that different slopes in [ ] /h@xmath9 vs. [ ] /h@xmath9 could be an indicator for different metallicities . as a result the individual gradients visible in fig .",
    "16 could indicate different metallicities for each halo hemisphere .",
    "if this is true ngc4402 would have the same metallicity as the milky way or its `` twin '' ngc891 .    the data for ngc4634 in fig .",
    "16 are in agreement with ma86 and demonstrate a constant run at 0.6 for the disk , followed by a relatively steep gradient . at @xmath103",
    "the ratio appears to remain constant at 1.0 . in the disk [ ] / [ ]",
    "is comparable to that of ngc891 but with increasing @xmath4 this similarity fades .",
    "in summary we note that strong nitrogen lines ( @xmath104 with respect to hydrogen ) are generally not well reproduced by pure photoionization models .",
    "the general trend of [ ] / [ ] is reproduced qualitatively but not quantitatively ( models can not account for localized changes ) .",
    "they even fail in fitting oxygen and helium line ratios for the halo .",
    "the diagnostic diagram using [ oiii ] and [ oi ] for ngc1963 indicates that shocks may contribute as an ionizing and heating source in the halo .",
    "this is similar to the finding of martin ( @xcite ) for diffuse ionized gas in the outflows of dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , for the objects studied here , the discussed line ratios do not only change with geometrical distance from the midplane of the disk , i.e. with respect to the location of the suspected ionizing sources .",
    "we rather find sudden localized changes , most evidently in ngc3044 and ngc4402 , indicating that ionization conditions and/or heating rates may change on length scales of a few hundred parsecs .",
    "these non - linear changes can also be seen in the correlation between [ sii]/[nii ] line ratios and emission measure ( figs .  4,9,12 , or 14 ) .",
    "since they also correlate with the local density of the diffuse medium , these variations can only be explained by small scale density fluctuations .      in order to probe our results and to establish a relationship between excitation mechanisms and gas kinematics",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "17 an additional diagnostic diagram regarding line width ( fwhm ) vs. line ratio following , e.g. , lehnert&heckman ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen [ ] @xmath496583 as kinematical tracer since its higher mass minimizes thermal broadening . only three target galaxies with nitrogen emission of @xmath105@xmath18 have been used for this plot .",
    "we point out that we did not correct for effects of kinematical line broadening .",
    "thus , the data in fig .",
    "17 do not show the pure thermal line broadening . in order to establish nevertheless a relationship between ionization and gas dynamics we minimized the effect of kinematical line broadening in using only slit positions located near the center of each galaxy ( s1 in ngc1963 , s1 in ngc3044 and s2 in ngc4634 , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . a correction for",
    "the instrumental profile has been applied .",
    "[ fig15 ]    the spectral resolution has been determined to be 4.6  by measuring the fwhm at different positions of hear calibration spectra .",
    "this translates into 210 km@xmath106 for the @xmath14 emission line , corresponding to 2.3 on a logarithmic scale . because most data in fig .",
    "17 are located between 2.2 and 2.4 one has to be aware that only values larger than 2.3 ( within the errors ) have a significant physical meaning .",
    "we therefore checked for consistency in measuring fwhm of the [ ] @xmath496300 nightsky line in ngc1963 and ngc3044 .",
    "since this prominent emission feature is nearest to the [ ] @xmath496583 spectral line one thus obtains more precise values of the kinematical resolution . in the present case",
    "the parameter has to be modified slightly to 4.2  or 200km@xmath106 , leading again to the same value as mentioned above .",
    "fortunately we are interested in line broadening towards the halo and hence the main body of the data can be used for analysis .    for all galaxies plotted in fig .",
    "17 a clear correlation between gas kinematics and its ionization is visible .",
    "the broadening of lines at high galactic latitudes , even if less significant , supports a prominent large scale motion or increased turbulence of the ionized gas particles . since this motion",
    "is tightly correlated to the ionization of the dig it seems that in the halo of these galaxies shocks , superwinds or turbulent mixing layers as additional ionization or heating sources occur .",
    "this can be seen very nicely in ngc1963 where disk and halo data cover different regions .",
    "additionally , the hybrid character of ngc3044 becomes obvious , again .",
    "line broadening suggests only very moderate shock contributions .",
    "although for ngc4634 the data allows no detailed diagnostics concerning possible ionization mechanisms fig .",
    "17 suggests that shocks ( besides photoionization ) could represent one possible additional excitation mechanism of the extraplanar dig .",
    "line ratios for the halos of ngc1963 , ngc3044 and ngc4634 can be explained as a combination of photoionization by o stars and shock ionization . since the measured fwhm increases with height above the galactic plane the results obtained from fig .",
    "17 support our findings that shocks can contribute to the ionization of the extraplanar dig .",
    "the photoionization models from mathis and domgrgen&mathis are not always capable to reproduce all line ratios correctly ( high [ ] @xmath496583/@xmath14 , [ ] @xmath496300/@xmath14 , and [ ] @xmath495876/@xmath14 ) .",
    "these models were developed to describe the measured line ratios for the milky way ( reynolds @xcite , b ) .",
    "however the local environment near the sun is not necessarily representative for the more active regions in our target galaxies .",
    "thus new models are required which should rest upon recently published extragalactic data and consider additional ionization / heating mechanisms such as shocks .",
    "it is important to mention that the ratios for all galaxies in fig .",
    "16 are not constant over the whole range of @xmath59 and can vary significantly on small scales ( @xmath87 250pc ) .",

    "photoionization models can explain the general shape of @xmath8/[\\ion{n}{ii}]$ ] but can not account for individual changes ( e.g. , ngc4402 ) .",
    "in addition non - linear changes , as visible in fig .  16 ,",
    "correlate with density and are explainable by small scale density fluctuations .",
    "if variations in @xmath107 reflect variations in electron temperature , leading to @xmath108 , these fluctuations could be due to changing metal abundances or varying densities within the dig . if different slopes in fig",
