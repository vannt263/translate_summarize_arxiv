    "the stimulated raman scattering instability in plasma occurs when an incident pump laser pulse scatters from an electron plasma wave@xcite .",

    ", the growth rate is maximized , and the ponderomotive force resulting from the beating of the stokes and pump waves reinforce the plasma wave .",
    "this , in turn , increases the energy scattered into the stokes sideband .",
    "the feedback process continues until the stokes wave itself becomes unstable or another nonlinear process takes over @xcite .",
    "amplification of the raman backscattered wave is physically equivalent to one of the operating regimes of the free electron laser . in either case",
    "relativistic analysis of the scattering process shows that the frequency is a complex - valued number with both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the imaginary part is of course connected with growth of the backscattered wave .",
    "the real part results in a pump amplitude dependent frequency shift that is physically distinct from the shift associated with the effective electron mass increase due to relativity .",
    "the wavelength of the back scattered radiation is commonly used to measure the plasma density in gas jets@xcite and plasma channels@xcite used in laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) experiments . only a limited number of experiments , however , have attempted to compare the raman based plasma density to independent methods like interferometry@xcite . at the same time , the theory of raman backscattering ( rbs ) is limited to intermediate laser intensities , below those acheivable by modern ultra - intense lasers .",
    "this deficiency calls into question plasma density retrieval from the measured rbs spectrum at intensities characteristic of laser wakefield accelerators .    at high laser intensities",
    "the rbs frequency shift is a function of both plasma density and laser intensity .",
    "this places a limitation on the use of raman backscatter spectroscopy as a plasma density diagnostic . on the other hand , detailed understanding of the scattering process",
    "can provide useful information about laser - plasma interactions .",
    "for example , it is shown below that raman backscattered radiation can be used to estimate the laser intensity inside a known density plasma target , provide information on the self - focusing conditions , or determine the optimal plasma density for quasi - linear wakefield acceleration . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed experimental study of nonlinear raman backscattering occuring in conditions relevant to laser wakefield acceleration .",
    "saturation of the rbs frequency shift occurs concomitantly with the acceleration of mev class electrons .",
    "the observations are shown to be in close agreement with theoretical analysis in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "experimental studies of raman backscattering were conducted using the lwfa facility at the naval research laboratory @xcite . the goal was to measure the rbs frequency shift as a function of plasma density and pump laser intensity .",
    "the typical experimental arrangement is shown in figure [ fig1]a and discussed below .",
    "a linearly polarized , 50 fs compressed , 400 mj , 8 tw peak power ( on target ) , 800 nm central wavelength pump laser was focused by an f - number 10 off - axis parabolic mirror onto an adjustable gas target @xcite inside a vacuum chamber . a fully - ionized plasma column formed along the laser propagation direction .",
    "the laser focal radius was measured in vacuum with 86.5% of the laser energy contained within a 5.1 micron spot .",
    "the gas target was attached to a 3-axis translation stage allowing adjustment of the focal point alignment . a small",
    ", frequency - doubled portion of the pump pulse was separated and used to probe the interaction region .",
    "this 400 nm probe beam was used to obtain the plasma density using folded wave , transverse interferometery a few picoseconds after the interaction . for plasma densities above @xmath0 the density",
    "was determined from neutral gas interferometry with the pump laser blocked before entering the interaction region .",
    "helium gas was used in all experiments and it was fully ionized by the pump laser for the range of experimental intensities .     for the rbs frequency shift in eq .",
    "each point on the graph corresponds to one independent measurement , solid lines are plotted to provide a visual guide of data trends .",
    "large fluctuations in the interferometry data at low pressures in ( b ) are due to small fringe shifts.,width=288 ]    the raman backscatter radiation was collected by an f - number 20 lens through a tunable laser line mirror ( cvi tlm1 - 800 - 45 ) .",
    "the mirror served as a @xmath125 nm bandwidth notch filter to reduce the background level of the scattered 800 nm pump .",
    "the collected back - reflected light was focused on the slit of an imaging spectrometer , coupled to a 16 bit linear array ccd sensor and to a picosecond - resolution streak camera .",
    "a typical output is shown in figure [ fig1]b .",
    "the streak camera was used to distinguish between the rbs radiation that arrived first , and stronger , but later arriving , light reflected off the walls of the vacuum chamber and from a light block positioned between the gas target and the electron spectrometer .",
    "these reflections arrived within a nanosecond - scale delay and were eliminated by proper arrangement of the light block and target positioning .",
    "the plasma density profile was adjusted by varying the gas jet backing pressure , nozzle tilt and nozzle geometry @xcite .",
    "experimental results were collected using a variety of gas targets , but for most of the experiments presented here a 0.75 mm - internal - diameter , 6 mm - long metal pipe was used as the nozzle .",
    "the nozzle was tilted 15 degrees off the normal to the pump laser propagation direction ( from right to left in figure [ fig1]d ) and provided the density profile shown in figure 1d as reconstructed from interferometry .",
    "the pump focal position was moved towards the elongated ( due to the tilt ) down - ramp side of the density profile ( z - position between 600 and 700 @xmath2 in figure [ fig1]d ) to create a gradient - assisted electron injector @xcite capable of delivering stable 20 mev electron bunches ( figure [ fig1]c ) .",
    "the electron energy spectrum was acquired by an electron spectrometer described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the pump laser intensity was varied by detuning the laser compressor , calibrated using high - dynamic - range third - order polarization frequency - resolved optical gating @xcite .",
    "the laser pulse was stretched over the range 50 fs - 3 ps in both positive and negative chirp directions .",
    "the results presented below were found to be independent of the chirp direction .    in the first set of experiments the peak plasma density measured with interferometry",
    "was compared to the density calculated from the frequency shift of the rbs radiation at peak pump power . assuming a linear frequency - matching condition for the backscattered stokes wave , @xmath3 an effective plasma density @xmath4 can be calculated from the plasma frequency @xmath5 , where q and m denote electron charge and mass .",
    "the rbs frequency @xmath6 is determined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the measured backscattered wavelength farthest from @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b for a typical spectrum ) . for calculation purposes we rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] as @xmath10    in lwfa , careful tailoring of plasma density is crucial to effective electron acceleration by the laser driven plasma waves .",
    "comparison of plasma density measurements using interferometry and raman frequency shift was routinely performed in the experiments to improve the accuracy of plasma density measurements . however , during careful examination of results from several sets of different lwfa experimental conditions , consistent discrepancies were seen between the two different density measurement techniques .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows plasma density measurements based on interferometry ( red crosses ) and on eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ( blue dots ) as functions of the backing pressure for two different plasma density profiles .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows results from the down - ramp density accelerator described above and displayed in figure [ fig1 ] , while figure [ fig2]b shows results from a 2 mm long , slit - shaped , flat - top , 0.5 mm - ramp gas jet with the pump laser focused in the middle . both jets generated lwfa electrons but in case of the down - ramp accelerator stable beams of monoenergetic electrons ( figure 1c ) were generated at high plasma densities ( between 7 and 8@xmath11 ) . in the flat - top density profile",
    "forward accelerated electrons started to appear at a lower plasma density of 2.5 - 3 @xmath11 , but acceleration was unstable with shot - to - shot fluctuations and a broad electron energy spectrum in most shots .",
    "while figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b appear different , they are similar in several important respects : i ) the interferometry measurements represent the `` true '' plasma density and the gas density of both gas jets and nozzles is a linear function of the backing pressure ; ii ) the plasma density , @xmath12 , calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] at low densities is also a linear function of the gas pressure , but is off - set to a higher plasma density indicating a larger shift of the raman frequency than expected from the interferometry measured density ; iii ) at higher plasma densities the saturation observed in the raman based curves coincides with the appearance of forward - accelerated electrons .",
    "the saturation of the raman based curve can be ascribed to the disturbance or destruction of the raman plasma wave by cavitation and bubble formation wave breaking , and phase - mixing occurring in nonlinear lwfa @xcite . in these conditions ,",
    "the raman driven plasma wave no longer has a quiescient plasma background from which to grow .",
    "the laser power in this case significantly exceeds the critical power ( see discussion section ) , causing catastrophic self - focusing over relatively short interaction distances within the gas jets .",
    "the bubble regime of lwfa relies on laser self - focusing in order to reach the necessary intensities @xcite . at increasing gas pressures laser",
    "self - focusing starts earlier along the laser propagation path , and eventually takes place before the peak density region of the gas target .",
    "the onset of strong self - focusing , followed by bubble formation , terminates the raman backscattering leading to the saturation observed in figure [ fig2 ] . the same arguments can be used to explain why the two curves cross at different pressures in ( a ) and ( b ) : the laser propagates a longer distance and with higher intensity ( the geometric focus is located at the peak of the plasma density ) in ( b ) and , as a result , experiences self - focusing at a lower density than in ( a ) .     for high density ( a ) and low density ( b ) cases , both from below the linear section of the rbs curve in figure [ fig2]a .",
    "vertical axes are connected by eq .",

    "the densities were chosen to be below self - focusing conditions , determined from the linear section of the @xmath12 curve in figure [ fig2]a .",
    "the interferometry density is , of course , independent of the laser intensity .",
    "in contrast , the effective density @xmath12 derived from the frequency of the backscattered light ( eq . [ eq2 ] ) changes substantially with the pulse duration and approaches the actual plasma density only when the laser pulse is stretched .",
    "figure [ fig1]b shows typical spectral shift of the rbs radiation from figure [ fig3]b run ; the only difference between the linear and nonlinear shots is the laser pulse duration .    a corresponding decrease in the laser intensity",
    "was also achieved by decreasing the laser energy , while keeping the laser pulse duration fixed at 50 fs .",
    "similar to figures [ fig1]b and [ fig3 ] , transitions of the rbs wavelength were observed , but the back - reflected signal dropped below the noise level when the pump laser energy was decreased below 20 mj .",
    "this placed a lower limit on the scanned laser intensities .",
