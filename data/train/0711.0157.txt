    "one of the longest standing problems in quantum mechanics is to obtain kepler s laws of planetary motion by taking the bohr correspondence limit of a suitable schrdinger wave function for an atomic elliptic state .",
    "the bohr correspondence limit of a quantum state is found by allowing the quantum numbers to become infinite while @xmath1 becomes vanishingly small with the energies and angular momenta of the system fixed with physical values of order one @xcite .",
    "we have approached this quantum mechanical problem from the perspective of nelson s stochastic mechanics .    in 1966 ,",
    "edward nelson produced a new formulation of non relativistic quantum mechanics in terms of diffusion processes satisfying the nelson - newton law , a stochastic version of newton s second law of motion @xcite .",
    "this work was based on the assumption that every particle of mass @xmath2 moves in a random environment driven by a brownian motion with diffusion constant @xmath3 .",
    "some mathematical physicists felt that nelson s formulation merely recapitulated the standard results of schrdinger quantum mechanics without explaining the physical agency responsible for the brownian noise in the system , and so the theory did not prove popular .",
    "however , the theory does give a new mental picture of the quantum world in which one can calculate the statistics of new observables , like first hitting times , which should be open to measurement @xcite .",
    "moreover , within this formulation , nelson showed that the nelson - newton law leads uniquely to schrdinger quantum mechanics , advocating the view that the schrdinger equation is a way of linearising a very complicated non - linear system of equations equivalent to the nelson - newton law .",
    "in this paper we will use nelson s stochastic mechanics to take the correspondence limit of the atomic elliptic state for the coulomb potential and show that this limit gives kepler s laws of planetary motion .",
    "we begin with a brief account of nelson s stochastic mechanics based on the summaries in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be the position of a particle of unit mass diffusing in @xmath5 according to an it stochastic differential equation with diffusion constant @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a @xmath9-dimensional brownian motion process on a probability space @xmath10 , with covariance , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes expectation with respect to the measure @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the process @xmath4 has a smooth density function @xmath14 such that for any @xmath15 , @xmath16 then the density @xmath17 must satisfy the forward kolmogorov equation , @xmath18    we define the mean forward and backward derivatives @xmath19 by , @xmath20 assuming some mild regularity conditions on @xmath21 , it s formula gives , @xmath22 in particular , it follows that the mean forward velocity is simply , @xmath23 furthermore , it can be shown that for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and it follows , using integration by parts , that for @xmath27 , @xmath28 this gives the mean backward velocity as , @xmath29 we can also introduce the osmotic velocity @xmath30 and the current velocity @xmath31 such that , @xmath32 if we now define the stochastic acceleration by , @xmath33 then it follows that , @xmath34 we now show how this apparently impenetrable expression takes on a deep significance in connection with the schrdinger equation .",
    "consider a quantum mechanical particle of unit mass in @xmath5 subject to the force field @xmath35 where @xmath36 is some real valued potential .",
    "the corresponding complex valued wave function @xmath37 satisfies the schrdinger equation , @xmath38 where ( letting @xmath39 denote the complex conjugate of @xmath37 ) the quantum mechanical particle density is , @xmath40 multiplying through equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) by @xmath39 gives the equivalent schrdinger equation , @xmath41 equating imaginary parts in ( [ conjugate ] ) gives the continuity equation , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability current , @xmath44 if we now write , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are real valued functions of space and time , then it follows that , @xmath48 the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) now becomes , @xmath49 therefore , if we let , @xmath50 then we have , @xmath51 this is the forward kolmogorov equation ( [ forward ] ) for a diffusion @xmath52 with forward and backward velocities , @xmath53 a tedious calculation from equations ( [ osmotic ] ) , ( [ acc ] ) and ( [ fwdbckwd ] ) gives the stochastic acceleration in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 as , @xmath54 however , equating real parts of equation ( [ conjugate ] ) gives , @xmath55 therefore , combining equations ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ acc2 ] ) gives , @xmath56 where @xmath36 is the potential in the schrdinger equation .",
    "equation ( [ newton ] ) is the nelson - newton law for a particle of unit mass .",
    "the nelson - newton law argues that to investigate the bohr correspondence limit of a quantum state , we should investigate the nelson diffusion process in the appropriate limit .",
    "section 2 starts from pauli s elegant solution of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we follow the results of lena , delande and gay @xcite to obtain the schrdinger wave function corresponding to an atomic elliptic state in @xmath57 and then find its related nelson diffusion process . in section 3 , we derive the formal limiting wave function for this atomic elliptic state according to bohr s prescription .",
    "we derive the corresponding limiting nelson diffusion and present simulations of the limiting process showing how the process converges in large times to a particular ellipse which we call the kepler ellipse .",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the drift for this limiting diffusion and demonstrate that it has a finite jump discontinuity across part of the semi - major axis of the kepler ellipse .",
    "this singularity is the bohr correspondence limit of the nodal surfaces of the atomic elliptic state wave function .    for the remainder of the paper we restrict our wave functions and diffusion processes to the putative plane of motion @xmath58 .",
    "in section 4 we introduce a new set of elliptic coordinates , the non - orthogonal keplerian elliptic coordinates , and show how these greatly simplify the limiting nelson diffusion process .",
    "in section 5 , we analyse the two dimensional limiting diffusion process .",
    "we discuss the behaviour of the invariant measure for this system and demonstrate that it is sharply peaked on the kepler ellipse .",
    "taking an idea from earlier work on excursions in stochastic mechanics @xcite , we introduce a similarity transform for the generator of the nelson diffusion process and use this to discuss the convergence over time of the density for the nelson diffusion processes to their invariant measures .",
    "we also show that there is a positive probability of hitting the drift singularity in a finite time .",
    "thus , to avoid inventing an artificial boundary condition , we restrict our path space so that our diffusing particle avoids this singularity and we estimate the probability for this to happen . on the restricted path space",
    "we see that the bohr correspondence limit reduces to the underlying deterministic dynamical system .    in section 6",
    "we look in detail at this underlying deterministic dynamical system .",
    "we show that this system has the kepler ellipse as a stable periodic orbit and we derive kepler s laws of planetary motion for a particle on this orbit .",
    "we identify which paths avoid the singularity and for these paths discuss the asymptotic stability of the kepler ellipse .",
    "we show that the invariant density can be used to construct a lyapunov function for the system . using this , we show that all motions starting outside the kepler ellipse converge to keplerian motion on the kepler ellipse . for motions starting inside the kepler ellipse",
    "the result is more difficult to prove and we leave this to a future publication .",
    "we conclude by highlighting some surprising symmetries within the diffusion process and use these symmetries to show that mild local instabilities occur in the dynamical system for @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the eccentricity of the kepler ellipse .",
    "thus , we see that in @xmath61 , for orbits starting outside the kepler ellipse and avoiding the singularity , the long time behaviour of the bohr correspondence limit of nelson s stochastic mechanics for atomic elliptic states is keplerian motion on the kepler ellipse .",
    "we believe that we can extend this result to @xmath57 but so far we have not found a convenient coordinate system in which to carry out the analysis .",
