    "during the last two decades or so , there has been a growing evidence of the independence of the two properties of _ determinism _ and _ predictability _ of classical dynamics .",
    "in fact , predictability for arbitrary long times requires also the _ stability _ of the motions with respect to variations  however small  of the initial conditions .    with the exception of integrable systems , the generic situation of classical dynamical systems describing , say , @xmath4 particles interacting through physical potentials ,",
    "is _ instability _ of the trajectories in the lyapunov sense .",
    "nowadays such an instability is called intrinsic stochasticity , or chaoticity , of the dynamics and is a consequence of nonlinearity of the equations of motion .",
    "likewise any other kind of instability , dynamical instability brings about the exponential growth of an initial perturbation , in this case it is the distance between a reference trajectory and any other trajectory originating in its close vicinity that _ locally _ grows exponentially in time .",
    "quantitatively , the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system is characterized by the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath0 that  if positive  measures the mean instability rate of nearby trajectories averaged along a sufficiently long reference trajectory .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 also measures the typical time scale of memory loss of the initial conditions .      in the conventional theory of chaos ,",
    "dynamical instability is caused by homoclinic intersections of perturbed separatrices , however this theory has many problems : _",
    "i ) _ it needs action - angle coordinates , _ ii ) _ it works in conditions of weak perturbation of an integrable system , _ iii ) _ to compute quantities like melnikov integrals one needs the analytic expressions of the unperturbed separatrices : at large @xmath4 this is hopeless , moreover the generalization of poincar - birkhoff theorem is still problematic at @xmath16 ; _ iv ) _ finally , there is no computational relationship between homoclinic intersections and lyapunov exponents .",
    "therefore this theory seems not adequate to treat chaos in hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom at arbitrary degree of nonlinearity , with potentials that can be hardly transformed in action - angle coordinates , not to speak of accounting for phenomena like the transition from weak to strong chaos in hamiltonian systems .",
    "motivated by the need of understanding this transition from weak to strong chaos , we have recently proposed @xcite to tackle hamiltonian chaos in a theoretical framework different from that of homoclinic intersections .",
    "this new method makes use of the well - known possibility of formulating hamiltonian dynamics in the language of riemannian geometry so that the stability or instability of a geodesic flow depends on curvature properties of some suitably defined manifold .    in the early 1940s ,",
    "n. s. krylov already got a hold of the potential interest of this differential - geometric framework to account for dynamical instability and hence for phase space mixing @xcite .",
    "the follow - up of his intuition can be found in abstract ergodic theory @xcite and in a very few mathematical works concerning the ergodicity of geodesic flows of physical interest @xcite .",
    "however , krylov s work did not entail anything useful for a more general understanding of chaos in nonlinear newtonian dynamics because one soon hits against unsurmountable mathematical obstacles . by filling certain mathematical gaps with numerical investigations , these obstacles",
    "have been overcome and a rich scenario emerged about the relationship between stability and curvature    based on the so - obtained information , the present paper aims at bringing a substantial contribution to the development of a riemannian theory of hamiltonian chaos .",
    "the new contribution consists of a method to analytically compute the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath0 for physically meaningful hamiltonian systems of arbitrary large number of degrees of freedom",

    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sezione2 ] is a sketchy presentation of the geometrization of newtonian dynamics ; section [ sezione3 ] contains the derivation of an effective stability equation from jacobi  levi - civita equation for geodesic spread and an analytic formula for @xmath0 ; section [ sezione4 ] contains the application of the general result to the practical computation of @xmath0 in the fermi - pasta - ulam @xmath3-model and in a chain of coupled rotators . some concluding remarks are presented in section [ sezione5 ] .",

    ", there are other possibilities to associate a riemannian manifold to a standard hamiltonian system . among the others we mention a structure , defined by eisenhart @xcite , that will be used in the following for computational reasons . in this case",
    "the ambient space is an enlarged configuration space - time @xmath43 , with local coordinates @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the time coordinate , @xmath47 is a coordinate closely related to the action ; eisenhart defines a pseudo - riemannian non - degenerate metric @xmath48 on @xmath49 as @xmath50 natural motions are now given by the canonical projection @xmath51 of the geodesics of @xmath52 on configuration space - time : @xmath53 . however , among all the geodesics of @xmath54 we must consider only those for which the arclength is positive definite and given by @xmath55 or , equivalently , we have to consider only those geodesics such that the coordinate @xmath56 evolves according to @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are real constants .",

    "the actual interest of the riemannian formulation of dynamics stems from the possibility of studying the instability of natural motions through the instability of geodesics of a suitable manifold , a circumstance that has several advantages .",
    "first of all a powerful mathematical tool exists to investigate the stability or instability of a geodesic flow : the jacobi  levi - civita equation ( jlc ) for geodesic spread .",
    "the jlc equation describes covariantly how nearby geodesics locally scatter and it is a familiar object both in riemannian geometry and theoretical physics ( it is of fundamental interest in experimental general relativity ) .",
    "moreover the jlc equation relates the stability or instability of a geodesic flow with _ curvature _ properties of the ambient manifold , thus opening a wide and largely unexplored field of investigation of the connections among geometry , topology and geodesic instability , hence chaos .",
    "a _ congruence of geodesics _ is defined as a family of geodesics @xmath65 that , originating in some neighbourhood @xmath66 of any given point of a manifold , are differentiably parametrized by some parameter @xmath67 .",
    "choose a reference geodesic @xmath68 , denote by @xmath69 the field of vectors tangent at @xmath70 to @xmath71 and denote by @xmath72 the field of vectors tangent at @xmath73 to the curves @xmath74 at fixed @xmath70 .",
    "the field @xmath75 is known as _",

    "locally we can measure the distance between two nearby geodesics by means of @xmath78 .",
    "the evolution of the geodetic separation field @xmath78 conveys information about stability or instability of the reference geodesic @xmath71 , in fact , if @xmath79 exponentially grows with @xmath70 then the geodesic is unstable in the sense of lyapunov , otherwise it is stable .",

    "we assume that @xmath72 is normal , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "this equation relates the stability or instability of nearby geodesics to the curvature properties of the ambient manifold .",
    "if the ambient manifold is endowed with a metric ( e.g. jacobi or eisenhart ) derived from the lagrangian of a physical system , then stable or unstable ( chaotic ) motions will depend on the curvature properties of the manifold .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to guess that some _ average _ global geometric property will provide information , at least , about an _",
    "average _ degree of chaoticity of the dynamics independently of the knowledge of the trajectories , that is independently of the numerical integration of the equations of motion .    in local",
    "coordinates the jlc equation ( [ eq_jacobi ] ) reads as @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the components of the curvature tensor , and the covariant derivative is @xmath89 .",
    "there are @xmath90 of such components , @xmath91 , therefore  even if this number can be considerably reduced by symmetry considerations  equation ( [ eq_jacobi_geo ] ) appears untractable already at rather small @xmath4 .",

    "such is the case of _ isotropic _ manifolds for which ( [ eq_jacobi_geo ] ) can be reduced to the simple form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the constant value assumed throughout the manifold by the sectional curvature .",

    "for an isotropic manifold @xmath104 is also independent of the choice of @xmath51 and thus , according to schur s theorem , @xmath93 turns out also independent of @xmath96 .",
    "unstable solutions of the equation ( [ jlc_isotrop ] ) are of the form @xmath105 once the initial conditions are assigned as @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in",

    " measures the degree of instability of nearby geodesics .    while eq .",
    "( [ jlc_isotrop ] ) holds true only for constant curvature manifolds , a similar form of general validity can be obtained for jlc equation at @xmath110 .    in this low - dimensional case",

    "@xmath117 is only possible if the potential @xmath118 has inflection points .",
    "recent detailed analyses of two - degrees of freedom systems have shown that chaos can be produced by _",
    "parametric instability _ due to a fluctuating positive curvature along the geodesics .",
    "let us remember that parametric instability is a generic property of dynamical systems with parameters that are periodically or quasi - periodically varying in time , even if for each value of the varying parameter the system has stable solutions @xcite .",
    "a harmonic oscillator with periodically modulated frequency , described by the mathieu equation , is perhaps the prototype of such a parametric instability mechanism .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that all the informations about order and chaos obtained by standard means ( lyapunov exponent and poincar sections ) are fully retrieved by using eq .",

    "hence we understand that eq .",
    "( [ eq_jacobi_weyl ] ) retains the structure of eq .",

    "the last term of ( [ eq_jacobi_weyl ] ) accounts for the local degree of anisotropy of the ambient manifold .",
    "let us now consider the following decomposition for the jacobi field @xmath78 @xmath132 where @xmath133 is an orthonormal system of parallely transported vectors . in this reference frame",

    ", i.e. that it looks like an isotropic manifold after a coarse - graining that smears out all the metric fluctuations , and let us formulate this assumption by putting @xmath149 and @xmath150 , although @xmath151 is no longer a constant .",

    "the problem is that @xmath159 still depends on a moving plane @xmath160 determined by @xmath161 and @xmath72 . in order",
    "to get rid of this dependence , consider that if @xmath96 is an isotropic point then the components of the ricci tensor are @xmath162 and the scalar curvature is @xmath163 ; with these quantities one constructs the einstein tensor @xmath164 whose divergence vanishes identically ( @xmath165 ) so that it is immediately found that , if a manifold consists entirely of isotropic points , then @xmath166 and so @xmath167 , i.e. the manifold is a space of constant curvature ( schur s theorem @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the local variation of ricci curvature detects the local loss of isotropy , thus a reasonable approximation of the _ average _ variation @xmath159 along a geodesic may be given by the variation of ricci curvature .",

    "( [ eq_hill ] ) only one sectional curvature is `` picked - up '' from point to point by @xmath172 so that @xmath172 remains finite with increasing @xmath4 .",

    "<S> a non - vanishing lyapunov exponent @xmath0 provides the very definition of deterministic chaos in the solutions of a dynamical system , however no theoretical mean of predicting its value exists . </S>",
    "<S> this paper copes with the problem of analytically computing the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath0 for many degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems as a function of @xmath1 , the energy per degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the functional dependence @xmath2 is of great interest because , among other reasons , it detects the existence of weakly and strongly chaotic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this aim - analytic computation of @xmath2 - is successfully reached within a theoretical framework that makes use of a geometrization of newtonian dynamics in the language of riemannian differential geometry . </S>",
    "<S> a new point of view about the origin of chaos in these systems is obtained independently of the standard explanation based on homoclinic intersections . dynamical instability ( chaos ) </S>",
    "<S> is here related to curvature fluctuations of the manifolds whose geodesics are natural motions and is described by means of jacobi  levi - civita equation ( jlce ) for geodesic spread . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how to derive from jlce an effective stability equation . under general conditions </S>",
    "<S> , this effective equation formally describes a stochastic oscillator ; an analytic formula for the instability growth - rate of its solutions is worked out and applied to the fermi - pasta - ulam @xmath3-model and to a chain of coupled rotators . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent agreement is found between the theoretical prediction and numeric values of @xmath2 for both models . </S>"
