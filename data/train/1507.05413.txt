    "recently a fixed - target experiment using the lhc beams has been proposed  @xcite , where the study on quarkonia in nuclear collisions becomes specifically important , due to the wide parton distributions in phase space which is helpful to reveal the charmonium production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "corresponding to the lhc beam energy @xmath0=2.76 a tev , where a is the nucleon number of the incident nucleus , the center - of - mass energy @xmath6=72 gev is in between the sps and rhic energies , and a quark - gluon plasma is expected to be created in the early stage of heavy ion collisions . taking into account the advantage of high luminosity in fixed - target experiments , which is helpful for detailed study of rare particles , the @xmath4 yield in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0=2.76 a tev per lhc run year is about 100 times larger than the @xmath4 yield in au+au collisions at @xmath7=62.4 gev per rhic run year  @xcite . with the high statistics , one may precisely distinguish between different cold and hot nuclear matter effects on charmonium production  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the shadowing effect  @xcite , namely the difference between the parton distributions in a nucleus and in a free nucleon , depends strongly on the parton momentum fraction @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath8 runs in a wide region , @xmath9 , in the fixed - target experiments , it provides a chance to see clearly the shadowing effect on the charmonium distributions in different rapidity bins . in this paper",
    ", we study the shadowing effect on the nuclear modification factors for @xmath4 yield and transverse momentum in pb+pb collisions at lhc beam energy @xmath10=2.76 a tev .",
    "the medium created in heavy ion collision at @xmath11 gev is assumed to reach local equilibrium at a proper time @xmath12=0.6 fm / c  @xcite , its consequent space - time evolution can be controlled by the ideal hydrodynamic equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the energy - momentum tensor , baryon current , four - velocity of the fluid cell , energy density , pressure and baryon density of the system .",
    "the solution of the hydrodynamic equations provides the local temperature @xmath20 , baryon chemical potential @xmath21 and fluid velocity @xmath22 of the medium which will be used in the calculation of the charmonium suppression and regeneration rates  @xcite . taking the assumption of hubble - like expansion and initial boost invariance along the colliding direction for high energy nuclear collisions",
    ", we can employ the well tested 2 + 1 dimensional version of the hydrodynamics in describing the evolution of the medium created at @xmath11 gev . introducing the proper time @xmath23 and space - time rapidity @xmath24 $ ] instead of the time @xmath25 and longitudinal coordinate @xmath26 ,",
    "the conservation equations can be simplified as  @xcite @xmath27 with the definitions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the three - velocity of the fluid cell and lorentz factor in the transverse plane .    to close the hydrodynamical equations one needs to know the equation of state of the medium . from recent studies on particle elliptic flow and shear viscosity ,",
    "the matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies is very close to a perfect fluid  @xcite .",
    "considering that the momentum integrated particle yield , especially for heavy quarkonia , is not sensitive to the equation of state , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite where the deconfined phase at high temperature is an ideal gas of gluons and massless @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks plus 150 mev massed @xmath35 quarks , and the hadron phase at low temperature is an ideal gas of all known hadrons and resonances with mass up to 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "there is a first order phase transition between these two phases . in the mixed phase ,",
    "the maxwell construction is used .",
    "the mean field repulsion parameter and the bag constant are chosen as @xmath36=450 mev @xmath37 and @xmath38=236 mev to obtain the critical temperature @xmath39 mev  @xcite at vanishing baryon number density .",
    "note that , when one calculates the rapidity or transverse momentum distribution of quarkonia , the choice of the equation of state may result in sizeable difference .",
    "the initialization of the hot medium is taken as the same treatment in ref .",
    "we use the final charged multiplicity to determine the initial entropy density . for @xmath40=72 gev",
    ", the charged multiplicity at central rapidity in center - of - mass frame is estimated to be @xmath41 based on the empirical formula  @xcite : @xmath42 the initial baryon density is obtained by adjusting the entropy per baryon to be 250  @xcite . from the empirical relation @xmath43  @xcite between the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath44 in unit of mb and the colliding energy @xmath45 in unit of gev , we have @xmath46 mb at @xmath45=72 gev .",
    "these initial conditions lead to a maximum medium temperature @xmath47=310 mev at the initial time @xmath12=0.6 fm / c .",
    "the medium maintains local chemical and thermal equilibrium during the evolution .",
    "if we do not consider the charmonium interaction with the hadron gas , the charmonium distributions in the final state will be fixed at time @xmath48 corresponding to the critical temperature @xmath49 of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "since a charmonium is so heavy , its equilibrium with the medium can hardly be reached , we use a boltzmann transport equation to describe its phase space distribution function @xmath50 in heavy ion collisions at impact parameter @xmath51 , @xmath52 where the loss and gain terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 come from the charmonium dissociation and regeneration in the created hot medium .",
    "we have neglected here the elastic scattering , since the charmonium mass is much larger than the typical medium temperature . considering that the feed - down from the excited states @xmath55 and @xmath56 to the ground state @xmath4  @xcite happens after the medium evolution , we should take transport equations for @xmath57 and @xmath56 when we calculate the @xmath4 distribution @xmath58 in the final state .    introducing the momentum rapidity @xmath59 $ ] and transverse energy @xmath60 to replace the longitudinal momentum @xmath61 and energy @xmath62 , the transport equation can be rewritten as @xmath63f_\\psi=- \\alpha_\\psi f_\\psi+\\beta_\\psi \\label{trans2}\\ ] ] with the dissociation and regeneration rates @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the third term in the square bracket arises from the free streaming of @xmath66 with transverse velocity @xmath67 which leads to a strong leakage effect at sps energy  @xcite .    considering the gluon dissociation @xmath68 in the quark - gluon plasma , the dissociation rate @xmath69 can be expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gluon energy , @xmath72 the flux factor , and @xmath73 the gluon thermal distribution as a function of the local temperature @xmath74 and fluid velocity @xmath75 determined by the hydrodynamics . the dissociation cross section in vacuum @xmath76 can be derived through the operator production expansion ( ope ) method with a perturbative coulomb wave function  @xcite . however , the method is no longer valid for loosely bound states at high temperature . to reasonably describe the temperature dependence of the cross section , we take the geometric relation between the averaged charmonium size and the cross section , @xmath77 the averaged radial square @xmath78 is calculated via potential model  @xcite with lattice simulated heavy quark potential  @xcite at finite temperature .",
    "when @xmath79 approaches to the charmonium dissociation temperature @xmath80 , the averaged radius square and in turn the cross section go to infinity , which means a complete charmonium melting induced by color screening  @xcite . using the internal energy @xmath81 as the heavy quark potential @xmath82 , the dissociation temperautre @xmath80 is calculated to be @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath55 , respectively  @xcite .    the regeneration rate @xmath86 is connected to the dissociation rate @xmath69 via the detailed balance between the gluon dissociation process and its inverse process  @xcite .",
    "to obtain the regeneration rate , we also need the charm quark distribution function in medium .",
    "although the initially produced charm quarks would carry high transverse momentum , they lose energy ( momentum ) when passing through the medium . considering",
    "the experimentally observed large open charm quench factor  @xcite and elliptic flow  @xcite , we take as a first approximation a kinetically thermalized momentum spectrum for the charm quark distribution @xmath87 .",
    "neglecting the creation and annihilation of charm - anticharm pairs inside the medium , the spacial density of charm quark number @xmath88 satisfies the conservation law @xmath89 with the initial density determined by the nuclear geometry @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are the thickness functions , and @xmath92 is the charm quark rapidity distribution in p+p collisions .    for the regeneration rate @xmath86 , we also considered the canonical effect which is shown to be important in explaining the suppression of strange mesons  @xcite . when there are only few pairs or even less than one pair of charm quarks produced in an event , one need to consider the canonical effect to guarantee the exact charm number conservation . taking into account the fact that the charm and anti - charm quarks inside a pair are produced at the same rapidity",
    ", we simply multiply the regeneration rate @xmath86 in a unit rapidity bin by a canonical enhancement factor  @xcite @xmath93    to take into account the relativistic effect on the dissociation cross section to avoid the divergence in the regeneration cross section , we should replace the charmonium binding energy by the gluon threshold energy in the calculations of @xmath69 and @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "in the hadron phase of the fireball with temperature @xmath94 , there are many effective models that can be used to calculate the inelastic cross sections between charmonia and hadrons  @xcite . for @xmath4",
    "the dissociation cross section is about a few mb which is comparable with the gluon dissociation cross section .",
    "however , considering that the hadron phase appears in the later evolution of the fireball , the ingredient density of the system is much more dilute in comparison with the early hot and dense period  @xcite .",
    "taking , for instance , the regeneration processes @xmath95 in quark matter and @xmath96 in hadron matter , the density ratio between charm quarks at initial temperature @xmath97 mev and @xmath98 mesons at critical temperature @xmath39 mev is around @xmath99 .",
    "considering further the life time of the quark matter @xmath100 fm / c and the life time of the hadron matter @xmath101 fm / c calculated from the hydrodynamics in section [ s2 ] , we neglect the charmonium production and suppression in hadron gas , to simplify the numerical calculations .",
    "note that , the suppression and regeneration in hadron gas may become important for excited charmonium states  @xcite .",
    "the transport equation can be solved analytically with the explicit solution  @xcite @xmath102 with @xmath103,\\nonumber\\\\ & & h(\\tau')=y-\\arcsin\\left(\\tau/\\tau ' \\sinh(y-\\eta)\\right),\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta(\\tau')=\\sqrt{1+(\\tau/\\tau')^2 \\sinh^2(y-\\eta)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first and second terms on the right - hand side of the solution ( [ solution ] ) indicate the contributions from the initial production and continuous regeneration , respectively , and both suffer from the gluon dissociation in the medium . since the regeneration happens in the deconfined phase , the regenerated quarkonia would have probability to be dissociated again by the surrounding gluons .",
    "the coordinate shifts @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the solution ( [ solution ] ) reflect the leakage effect in the transverse and longitudinal directions .    for fixed - target nuclear collisions at @xmath106=2.76 a tev ,",
    "the collision time for the two pb nuclei to pass through each other in the center of mass frame is @xmath107 fm / c , which is compatible with the charmonium formation time but shorter than the qgp formation time @xmath108 fm .",
    "therefore , all the cold nuclear matter effects can be reflected in the initial charmonium distribution @xmath109 at time @xmath12 .",
    "we take into account nuclear absorption , nuclear shadowing and cronin effect .",
    "the initial distribution in the solution ( [ solution ] ) can be obtained from a superposition of p+p collisions , along with the modifications from these cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "the nuclear absorption is important in explaining the @xmath4 suppression in p+a and a+a collisions at low energies .",
    "it is due to the inelastic collision between the initially produced charmonia and the surrounding nucleons , and its effect on the charmonium surviving probability can be described by an effective absorption cross section @xmath110 .",
    "the value of @xmath110 is usually measured in p+a collisions and is several mb at sps energy . since the nuclear absorption becomes weaker at higher colliding energy due to the shorter collision time@xcite , we take @xmath110=2 mb at @xmath106=2.76 a tev  @xcite and the nuclear absorption factor @xmath111    the cronin effect broadens the momentum distribution of the initially produced charmonia in heavy ion collisions  @xcite . in p+a and a+a",
    "collisions , the incoming partons ( both gluons and quarks ) experience multiple scatterings with surrounding nucleons via soft gluon exchanges .",
    "the initial scatterings lead to an additional transverse momentum broadening of partons which is then inherited by produced hadrons  @xcite . since the cronin effect",
    "is caused by soft interactions , rigorous calculations for the effect are not available .",
    "however , the effect is often treated as a random motion . inspired from a random - walk picture , we take a gaussian smearing  @xcite for the modified transverse momentum distribution @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the path length of the two initial gluons in nuclei before fusing into a charmonium at @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the averaged charmonium transverse momentum square gained from the gluon scattering with a unit of length of nucleons , and @xmath118 is the charmonium momentum distribution in a free p+p collision .",
    "the cronin parameter @xmath117 is usually extracted from corresponding p+a collisions . considering the absence of p+a collision data at @xmath119= 72 gev",

    "the charmonium production becomes a @xmath125 process approximately , and the longitudinal momentum fractions of the two initial gluons are calculated from the momentum conservation , @xmath126 the free distribution @xmath127 can be obtained by integrating the elementary partonic process , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the gluon distribution in a free proton , @xmath130 the emitted gluon rapidity , @xmath131 the charmonium momentum distribution produced from a gluon fusion process , and @xmath132 the factorization scale of the fusion process .",
    "now we consider the shadowing effect .",
    "the distribution function @xmath133 for parton @xmath134 in a nucleus differs from a superposition of the distribution @xmath135 in a free nucleon .",
    "the nuclear shadowing can be described by the modification factor @xmath136 . to account for the spatial dependence of the shadowing in a finite nucleus",
    ", one assumes that the inhomogeneous shadowing is proportional to the parton path length through the nucleus  @xcite , which amounts to consider the coherent interaction of the incident parton with all the target partons along its path length .",
    "therefore , we replace the homogeneous modification factor @xmath137 by an inhomogeneous one  @xcite @xmath138 with the definition @xmath139 .",
