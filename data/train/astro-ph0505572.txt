    "there is little doubt that interstellar medium is turbulent ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence proved to be ubiquitous in molecular clouds @xcite , diffuse ionized @xcite and neutral @xcite media .",
    "recent years were marked by a substantial progress in theoretical and numerical description of both incompressible and compressible magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulent cascade @xcite .",
    "mhd turbulence controls many essential astrophysical processes including star formation , transport and acceleration of cosmic rays , of heat and mass ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the progress in testing and advancing our theoretical understanding of these astrophysical processes rely on recovering the actual parameters of turbulent cascade from observational data .    for this , the statistical approach is useful ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the turbulent medium is , generally , a non - uniform distribution of matter with stochastic , random , density @xmath2 , that moves according to stochastic velocity field @xmath3 . recovering the scaling of statistical descriptors for",
    "stochastic density and velocity will allow us to get insight into mechanisms , responsible for turbulent driving . among the two",
    ", the most direct information about the turbulence is contained in the statistics of the velocity field , while the statistics of density fluctuations usually provides complimentary indirect way of testing turbulence .    a wealth of observational information is contained in spectral or channel maps of the emission lines produced by gas tracing the turbulent cascade . both inhomogeneous distribution of the emitting matter and its motions result in small scale fluctuations of the emission intensity observed at a given velocity",
    "the problem is to relate the two dimensional statistics of intensity maps to underlying three dimensional properties of the turbulence and disentangle the effects of random motions from the effects of density fluctuations .",
    "this problem is addressed in the velocity channel analysis ( vca ) @xcite which we review here .",
    "vca provides theoretical framework for quantitative interpretation of observational data in terms of turbulent properties .",
    "the observational data has been obtained for the variety of lines , mapping different regions of our galaxy ( or its satellites ) and different physical conditions - @xmath4 diffused @xmath5 in outer parts of the galactic disk @xcite , towards the galactic center @xcite and in small magellanic cloud @xcite , @xmath6 lines in molecular clouds @xcite , @xmath7 lines in reynolds layer @xcite . in all the cases",
    "the reported index of the power spectrum of turbulence is close to @xmath8 .",
    "this is really remarkable given that these results are obtained for quite different observables and that @xmath9 does not correspond to kolmogorov @xcite cascade , the one case when some universality may be expected . to complicate the matter ,",
    "some lines are optically thin , given view for the full depth of the emitters along the line of sight , while for the other ( definitely for @xmath6 , but also for @xmath5 viewed towards the galactic center ) self absorption is important . here , using the formalism of vca , we will demonstrate how the universal power spectral scaling in the data may be explained .",
    "the main feature of the stochastic random fields arising as a result of turbulent processes is that they are correlated .",
    "the central object which describes their properties is the correlation function @xmath10 ( or where more suitable - the structure function @xmath11 ) .",
    "related and often less limited descriptor is the power spectrum @xmath12 , which is a fourier transform of the correlation ( structure ) functions .",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to the case of the turbulence that is statistically homogeneous and isotropic in three dimensional position space @xcite , and a different scaling along the magnetic field .",
    "further research in @xcite has shown that the basic features of the goldreich - sridhar turbulence carry over for alfvenic perturbations to the compressible regime .",
    "observations , however , are usually unable to identify the local orientation of magnetic field and deal with the magnetic field projection integrated over the line of sight . as the result",
    "the locally defined perpendicular and parallel directions are mixed together in the process of observations @xcite .",
    "there is some residual anisotropy , but this anisotropy is scale - independent and is determined by the rate of the meandering of the large scale field . so from the observational point of view the picture of the isotropic turbulence remains to some extend applicable .",
    "the spectra of intensity fluctuations obtained from the goldreich - sridhar turbulence and the isotropic turbulence are similar . ] in which case correlation functions depend only on separation distance @xmath13 between two positions in space . in particular , for the density field @xmath2 we define the correlation function @xmath14 or , alternatively , the structure function @xmath15    statistical descriptors can often be assumed to have power - law dependence on scale @xmath16 , where @xmath17 can be both positive and negative .",
    "the correlation function @xmath10 is an appropriate choice when stochastic inhomogeneities have more power on small scales , which corresponds to @xmath18 , while when the power is concentrated on large scales and @xmath19 , the structure function should be used . with this substitution in mind",
    "both cases can be treated similarly in the most interesting regime of small @xmath13 .    for power law",
    "correlations the power spectrum @xmath20 also has power law form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the relation between spectral index @xmath23 and correlation scaling @xmath17 involves the dimensionality of space @xmath24 and is different for three dimensional fields and two dimensional maps .    to be exact ,",
    "in the case of density it is more appropriate to assume a power law scaling for the density fluctuations around the mean @xmath25 rather than for the density field itself , so that @xmath26 \\ ; . \\label{eq : xirho}\\ ] ] for example , in kolomogorov turbulence the medium is incompressible , however the passive tracers of the flow , which we may observe as emitters develop passive scalar density inhomogeneities which scale as @xmath27 , i.e @xmath28 in our notations",
    ".    whether the medium is incompressible or not , the stochastic motions are the essence of turbulence .",
    "an isotropic random velocity field @xmath3 is fully described by the structure tensor @xmath29 , which can be expressed via longitudinal @xmath30 and transverse @xmath31 components @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 equals 1 for @xmath34 and zero otherwise .",
    "we need only projection of the velocity structure function onto the line of sight , which we identify with @xmath35 direction @xmath36 . for the power - law regime @xmath37 in kolmogorov",
    "turbulence velocity scales the same way , @xmath38 , as the density of the passive scalar .",
    "thus the kolmogorov spectrum index is @xmath39 . in turbulence literature",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath40 is usually used . in this notation",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum is @xmath41 , often referred to as @xmath42 law .",
    "one does not observe the gas distribution in the real space galactic coordinates @xmath43 where the 3d vector @xmath44 is defined .",
    "rather , intensity of the emission in a given spectral line is defined in position - position - velocity ( ppv ) cubes towards some direction on the sky and at a given line - of - sight velocity @xmath45 . in the plane parallel approximation the direction on the sky is identified with @xmath46 plane where the 2d spatial vector @xmath47 is defined , so that the coordinates of ppv cubes available through observations are @xmath48 . the relation between the real space and ppv descriptions",
    "is defined by a map @xmath49 .",
    "the central object for our study is a turbulent cloud in ppv coordinates .",
    "the number of particles per unit volume @xmath50 is given by the ppv density @xmath51 , which statistical properties depend on the density of gas in real galactic coordinates , but also on velocity distribution of gas particles .",
    "henceforth , we use the subscript @xmath52 to distinguish the quantities in @xmath53 coordinates from those in @xmath54 coordinates .",
    "we shall always assume 2d statistical homogeneity and isotropy of @xmath51 in @xmath47-direction over the image of a cloud .",
    "however , homogeneity along the velocity direction can only be assumed after additional considerations , if at all . naturally , there is no symmetry between @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "the equation ( [ ksicloud ] ) is an important and rather universal result .",
    "however , it contains several approximations which entered the derivation and have to be kept in mind :    * we have assumed that the underlying turbulent velocity obeys gaussian statistics .",
    "no such assumptions have been made for the density , however .",
    "* perhaps most importantly , we have assumed that the velocity and density are uncorrelated .",
    "it is definitely true if they are taken at the same point due to vector nature of velocity field , but needs not be accurate at finite separations .",
    "an example of a process which may produce correlations is the self - gravity of the gas , which will point some velocity vectors towards overdensities .",
    "this assumption was tested numerically in @xcite .",
    "correlations have to be quite high to change our results , and that level of correlation has not been observed .",
    "* at the final stage , we assume homogeneity along the velocity dimension as well as in two spatial directions on the sky . for this to be applicable in practice , one may have to subtract the average spectral line profile and work with fluctuations of intensity .",
    "* the formalism , leading to the equation ( [ ksicloud ] ) has to be extended if the temperature of the gas varies from point to point and the turbulence is near subsonic .",
    "the correlation in ppv space reflects , as expected , both underlying inhomogeneities of the matter through @xmath10 and its velocity through @xmath66 .",
    "important feature of the ppv space is that @xmath51 exhibits fluctuations even if the flow is incompressible and no density fluctuations are present . indeed ,",
    "when one substitutes the expanded expression ( [ eq : xirho ] ) , @xmath67 , into eq  ( [ ksicloud ] ) , both terms give rise to non - trivial contributions to @xmath68 .",
    "intensity @xmath69 in the spectral line measured at the velocity @xmath45 in the direction @xmath47 is obtained by integrating the standard equation of radiative transfer ( spitzer 1978 ) @xmath70 along the line of sight . in the case of self - adsorbing emission in spectral lines",
    "the coefficients are proportional to first power of density : @xmath71 where @xmath72 describes the velocity distribution of atoms at the position @xmath35 along the line of sight , and all quantities have implicit dependence on the sky direction @xmath47 .",
    "obvious relation @xmath73 links us to the formalism of ppv density .      in observations",
    "we register the intensity @xmath79 , integrated over velocity channel @xmath80 which width and shape is described by the window function @xmath81 .",
    "the properties of the window function are restricted , first of all , by the experimental setup .",
    "for instance for @xmath6 lines studies @xcite integration is typically being performed over the whole line , @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "measurements in 21 cm hi line are performed in velocity slices of ppv data cube ( channel maps ) , which corresponds to @xmath83 strongly peaked at a particular velocity @xmath84 .    when velocity channels are narrow we have an opportunity to synthetically increase the width of the channels by combining the data from the adjacent ones . within the vca technique we point out that by varying the width of synthetic velocity channels one can separate statistics of turbulent velocities and density inhomogeneities of emitting medium .",
    "the minimal width of the velocity channel is determined by the resolution of an instrument . however , thermal motions of the gas lead to the smearing of intensity fluctuations similar in effect to finite resolution .",
    "qualitatively , one can think of the minimal width of the channels available for vca as given by a convolution of instrumental and thermal effects .",
    "from the point of view of vca approach , the most informative data comes from optically thin lines , such as , for example hi 21 cm . in the limit",
    "when the absorption can be neglected line intensity contains direct information about ppv density of emitters ( [ eq : thini ] ) and the correlation function is simply @xmath87 ~~,\\\\ \\label{eq : optthin } \\xi({\\bf r } ) & = & \\epsilon^2 \\int { \\mathrm d } v_1 w(v_1 ) \\int { \\mathrm d } v_2 w(v_2 ) \\xi_s({\\bf r } , v_1,v_2)~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us assume that after subtracting the mean line profile , the fluctuations of ppv density are statistically homogeneous not only in @xmath47 , but in velocity direction as well .",
    "we shall write out in detail the correlation function as leading to more compact expressions , but present the final results in terms of more appropriate @xmath88 . from the eq .",
    "( [ ksicloud ] ) , in the expanded form , @xmath89 ~~ , \\label{appd : xir}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the difference in velocities between two emitters , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the effective channel window @xmath92 is a square of the experimental window convolved with the gaussian that describes the thermal velocities @xmath93 for convenience let us parameterize the effective window with a gaussian shape with the width @xmath94 , @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the exact shape , of course , depends on the properties of the instrument .    equation ( [ appd : xir ] ) provides the main theoretical foundation for vca of optically thin lines .",
    "it describes two fundamental regimes :    thick channel : :    the effective channel width @xmath94 is larger than the    turbulent velocities at the scale @xmath58 ,    @xmath96 .",
    "in this case we collect    inside our channel essentially all emitters , however scattered along    the velocity axis they are by the turbulence .",
    "essentially ,    @xmath97 and    @xmath98 information about the turbulent velocities is    erased , but one can recover information about density inhomogeneities .",
    "thin channel : :    , @xmath99 .",
    "turbulent velocity    differences are important , many emitter pairs close along the line of    sight acquire disparate velocities and do not contribute to the    correlation of sources restricted to the narrow velocity channel .",
    "the    amplitude of correlation decreases , but the most important outcome is    that this decrease is scale dependent and we have a change in scaling    law which reflects the underlying velocity statistics .",
    "indeed , in this    case    @xmath100    interpretation of thick channel data contains no surprises , reflecting projected density inhomogeneities of the gas .",
    "however if measurements are done in a sufficiently thin channel ( and the criterion depends on scale between two lines of sight ) , the fluctuations of intensity may come from two sources . recall that @xmath101 , therefore @xmath102 the first term describes the intensity fluctuations arising just from turbulent motions of emitters .",
    "the second is the velocity modified scaling of the underlying density fluctuations . in table [ tab : a ] we summarize the predicted scaling for the optically thin emission intensity in the channel maps .",
    ".scaling of emission intensity in optically thin lines [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in view of this analysis @xmath6 measurements of @xcite which show shallower , @xmath103 , slope instead of @xmath104 may be taken to indicate that in molecular clouds the density inhomogeneities have enhanced small scale power with @xmath105 and dominate the velocity contribution .",
    "however to make definitive statement one needs to make sure that the difference of @xmath106 in the power spectrum can not arise from the noise in the data .",
    "@xmath107 or better seems to be an accuracy we need to have to distinguish between different theoretical possibilities discussed in this paper .",
    "we have reviewed the formalism of velocity channel analysis for optically thin lines and its extension to the lines with self - absorption .",
    "we demonstrate that by observing optically thin lines from cold gas in sufficiently narrow ( thin ) velocity channels one may recover the scaling of the stochastic velocities from turbulent cascade , in particular , kolmogorov velocities give @xmath0 contribution to the intensity power spectrum .",
    "this matches the observational data in hi , both in our galaxy and in small magellanic cloud .",
    "synthetically increasing the channel thickness separates out the underlying density inhomogeneities of the gas . an attempt to apply this technique to hi lines in smc @xcite indeed showed the expected steepening of the spectrum with the channel thickness .",
    "effects of self absorption , on the other hand , retain the velocity signature even for integrated lines . as a result ,",
    "intensity fluctuations from velocity tend to show universal scaling of the power @xmath1 over the range of scales . observed shallower spectra @xmath108 in co lines",
    "therefore may indicate that real density spectrum is also shallow @xmath108 and dominates the signal .",
    "progress in interpretation of the data require the knowledge of the power spectrum index better than with an accuracy of 0.3 and developing of the accurate theoretical and numerical models to match such accuracy in different regimes .",
