    "most of the solar system phenomena such as the mercury precession can be successfully explained in the context of einstein gravity , but when we intend to study beyond the solar system or strong gravity regimes , this theory encounters some problems .",
    "accelerated expansion of our universe is one of the main challenging subjects of cosmologists perlmutter1,perlmutter2,perlmutter3 , whereas einstein gravity can not properly explain it . in order to interpret this expansion ,",
    "some various candidates have been proposed by many authors . among various alternatives ,",
    "one may point out the modified gravities like lovelock gravity lovelock1,lovelock2,dehghani1,dehghani2 , brane world cosmology brax1,brax2,brax3 , scalar - tensor theories brans1,brans2,brans3,brans4,brans5,harada1,harada2,harada3,harada4,harada5 and @xmath5 gravity souza1,souza2,souza3,souza4,souza5,souza6,cooney1,cooney2,cooney3,cooney4,cooney5 .    from the cosmological point of view , the dark energy is an unknown form of energy which is hypothesized to permeate the spacetime , tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain the observations since the 1990s indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate .",
    "another model of these interesting candidates is related to the cosmological constant . in this theory , the cosmological constant may add to the einstein lagrangian @xcite for explaining such acceleration .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest possible form of dark energy , which leads to the current standard model of cosmology known as the @xmath6-cdm model and provides a good fit to many cosmological observations .    from the astrophysical point of view , stars reach the equilibrium state due to the balance between gravitational force and internal pressure . therefore , in order to study the structure of stars , we should obtain a suitable hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( hee ) and then we can study the structure properties of stars .",
    "the neutron and quark stars are in the category of celestial objects with high mass , high density and small radius , and therefore , they are called compact objects . due to this fact , we need to take into account the effects of general relativity ( spacetime curvature ) for investigating their structures . the first hee of stars in @xmath3-dimensional einstein gravity has been studied by tolman , oppenheimer and volkoff ( tov ) @xcite .",
    "also , the physical characteristics of stars using tov equation have been investigated by many authors silbar1,silbar2,silbar3,silbar4,silbar5,silbar6,silbar7,silbar8 .",
    "recently , survey of compact objects in different gravity has attracted the attention of researchers , in particular , the models of modified gravity which involve higher curvature terms or a scalar field @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested to study the structure and evolution of stars in different theories of gravity with various sources , the new hee must be obtained .",
    "therefore , in recent years , the generalizations and modifications of tov equation have been investigated in various theories of gravity , such as : dilaton gravity @xcite , gravity s rainbow @xcite , massive gravity @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8  gravities astashenok2015aastashenok2015b , momeni1,momeni2,momeni3,momeni4 and p ost - newtonian theory @xcite ( see also refs .",
