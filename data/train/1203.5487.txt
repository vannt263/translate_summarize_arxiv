    "bachman introduced the concept _ `` a critical surface '' _ and he proved several theorems about incompressible surfaces , the number of heegaard splittings with respect to its genus , and the minimal genus common stabilization .",
    "since a critical surface has disjoint compressions on it s both sides , if the surface is a heegaard surface , then the splitting is weakly reducible , i.e. a critical heegaard splitting is a kind of weakly reducible splitting .",
    "but in some aspects , it shares common properties with strongly irreducible splittings .",
    "for example , if the splitting is strongly irreducible or critical , then the manifold is irreducible ( lemma 3.5 of @xcite . ) indeed , the intersection of an incompressible surface @xmath4 and a heegaard surface @xmath5 can be isotoped essential on both @xmath4 and @xmath5 if the splitting is critical or strongly irreducible ( see theorem 5.1 of @xcite and lemma 6 of @xcite . )",
    "bachman also proved gordon s conjecture by using the series of generalized heegaard splittings and critical heegaard splittings ( see @xcite . ) in his recent work @xcite , he also introduced the concept _ `` topologically minimal surfaces '' _ , where a strongly irreducible surface is an index @xmath6 topological minimal surface , and a critical surface is an index @xmath7 topological minimal surface , this is a way to regard strongly irreducible surfaces and critical surfaces in a unified viewpoint .",
    "although critical heegaard splittings have many powerful properties as proved in bachman s recent works , it is not easy to determine whether a weakly reducible splitting is critical . for genus",
    "two @xmath1-manifolds , a weakly reducible splitting is also a reducible splitting ( see @xcite , the proof can be extended easily to the case with non - empty boundary . )",
    "moreover , if a @xmath1-manifold has a reducible splitting , then the manifold is reducible or the splitting is stabilized ( see @xcite . ) since a reducible manifold can not have a critical heegaard splitting , we need to consider the manifolds of genus at least three . in this article , we will prove theorem [ theorem - main ] .",

    "( in 1987 , casson and gordon proved this when @xmath0 is closed and the heegaard splitting is irreducible ( see @xcite . ) ) by using bachman s result ( theorem 5.1 of @xcite ) , we can directly get the following corollary .",

    "in addition , we will show that the induced heegaard splitting of the three component chain exterior by a certain tunnel system is critical .",
    "a _ compression body _ is a @xmath1-manifold which can be obtained by starting with some closed , orientable , connected surface @xmath5 , forming the product @xmath16 , attaching some number of @xmath7-handles to @xmath17 and capping off all resulting @xmath7-sphere boundary components that are not contained in @xmath18 with @xmath1-balls .",
