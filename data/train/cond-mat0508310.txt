    "dry particle flows driven by gravity ( as in emptying hoppers or silos ) or by a gas current ( in pneumatic transport @xcite ) are encountered in many industrial processes .",
    "modeling such flows represents a challenging fundamental problem since they involve complex interactions of moving grains with the surrounding air , bounding walls and other grains .",
    "various flow regimes may be observed in these systems according to the spatial distribution of the particle concentration and velocity field .",
    "examples of such regimes include the free - fall of particles at high velocities and low particle fractions , slow compact flows with high particle fractions , and density waves in which compact and dilute zones alternate @xcite",
    ". these particle flows may be stationary ( in this case , particles  or density waves  propagate at a constant mean velocity ) or display oscillations , stick - slip motions , intermittency or blockage effects .",
    "such non - stationarities have been reported in the simultaneous flow of air and grains in vertical pipes @xcite and are encountered in a variety of settings .",
    "they represent a significant problem in many large - scale industrial facilities such as silos or pneumatic transport systems : intermittent flows may induce very large , potentially destructive , pressure variations .",
    "several approaches have been suggested to model theoretically granular flows in pipes , each of them being applicable to only a part of the flow regimes .",
    "kinetic theories @xcite are best suited when the particle fraction is lower than 0.5 and collisional effects play an important part . in this regime ,",
    "the time between two successive collisions is large compared to the duration of the collision . at higher particle fractions , grains are in contact with their neighbors a large fraction of the time and friction forces between particles and walls become significant .",
    "although attempts have been made to adapt the kinetic theory to these frictional regimes @xcite , different approaches have often been used . in their study of compact",
    "moving bed flows , chen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite use the classical janssen theory @xcite to estimate friction forces on the walls from the relation between the vertical component of the stress - tensor in the grain packing and the horizontal normal stress component on the walls .    the present work deals with intermittent compact flows of grains in a vertical tube of small diameter .",
    "in this case , the particle fraction is very close to that of a static random packing of particles , and the solid friction between particles and walls is always important .",
    "the objective of this study is to analyze the spatio - temporal characteristics of the onset and blockage of such intermittent flows .",
    "of special interest is the relation between air pressure , particle fraction and grain velocities and the manner in which variations of these quantities are amplified as they propagate along the flow tube .",
    "a similar flow regime is encountered in the  ticking hourglass \" experiment @xcite corresponding to a periodic intermittent granular flow between two closed glass containers connected by a short vertical constriction . in this case , intermittency is believed to be largely due to the build - up of a pressure difference induced by the grain flow between the two containers ( both because air is dragged downwards and because the empty volume available for air increases with time in the upper container and decreases in the lower one ) .",
    "once the back pressure is sufficiently large to halt flow , it decays due to air flow through the grain packing in the constriction until it is low enough to permit flow . in this experiment ,",
    "the key phenomena are localized in a small volume close to the constriction ; in particular , static arches of particles are believed to build up right above it , where transient fractures of the packing are also observed .    in the intermittent compact flow down a long vertical tube considered in the present study ,",
    "the flow intermittency phenomenon is distributed over most of the height of the tube .",
    "this allows one to perform simultaneously a large variety of measurements ( local pressures and particle fractions , air and grain flow rates ,  ) at several locations , and so characterized the variations of the flow with height .",
    "high resolution spatio - temporal diagrams of particle motions along the tube are also obtained and allow for the characterization of propagation of the onset and blockage of the grain flow along the tube length .    in section",
    "[ exp ] , we describe the experimental set - up and procedure . then , in section  [ expresult ] , the qualitative characteristics of the compact intermittent flows are described , and quantitative data and estimates of air pressure , particle fraction and flow rate variations are presented . in section",
    "[ analysis ] , we discuss appropriate volume and mass conservation equations and their bearing on the experimental results . the various forces acting on the grains and the manner in which they may induce intermittency are discussed in section  [ model ] .",
    "the equations of motion are then written and solved numerically in order to model the spatial variations of pressure , particle fraction and grain velocities .",
    "the granular flow takes place in a vertical glass tube of radius @xmath0=(1.5@xmath10.025)mm and length @xmath2=1.25 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dessinmanip ] ) .        grains flow from a spherical hopper welded to the top of the pipe .",
    "the bottom end is fitted with a variable constriction allowing one to adjust the outflow : this constriction is realized by a cylinder with a conical tip which can be precisely moved across the pipe ( see insert of fig .  [",
    "fig : dessinmanip ] ) .",
    "the grains are spherical glass beads of diameter 2@xmath3=(175@xmath125)@xmath4 m and density @xmath5=(2.50@xmath10.02)10@xmath6kgm@xmath7 .",
    "electronic scales are placed below the tube and their output is transmitted to a computer at the rate of one sample per second .",
    "the mass flow rate @xmath8 of the grains is then determined from the time variation of the measured mass .",
    "the grain flow rate will be characterized by the mean superficial velocity @xmath9 representing the volume flow rate of grains per unit area with : @xmath10 the hopper is connected to the tube but otherwise closed except for an air inlet .",
    "the volume flow rate @xmath11 of air into the hopper is measured by an on - line sensor ( the precision is @xmath11% at the largest flow rates ) .",
    "an additional transducer measures the air pressure @xmath12 inside the hopper .",
    "continuity requires that the inflow of air compensates for the volume of both air and grains leaving through the vertical tube .",
    "therefore if @xmath12 remains constant with time , @xmath11 is the sum of the volume flow rates of air and of the grains in the experimental tube .",
    "the superficial velocity @xmath13 of air in the tube ( volume flow rate per unit area ) thus satisfies : @xmath14 four pressure sensors are placed along the tube at vertical distances 200 , 450 , 700 and 950 mm below the outlet of the hopper .",
    "they are connected to the inside of the tube through 0.5 mm diameter holes in the tube wall .",
    "a fine - meshed grid is stretched across the holes on the external wall to prevent grains from entering the sensors .",
    "an independent experiment has been realized to estimate the pressure drop across the grid and the portholes during typical pressure transients encountered in the intermittent flows . due to the low dead volume of the transducer ( 23@xmath4l ) ,",
    "the corresponding error on the pressure measurement is less than 10pa for the fastest transients : this will be seen below to be much smaller than the pressure to be measured .",
    "local mean particle fraction variations in tube sections are measured by an electrical capacitance sensor using two shielded 3 mm diameter cylindrical electrodes pressed against the outside tube walls and facing each other .",
    "the sensor is connected to a @xmath15 capacitance bridge ( 10khz measurement frequency ) and a lock - in detector with a 680@xmath4s time constant .",
    "the noise level is of order @xmath16pf , which corresponds to particle fraction variations of order 10@xmath7 .    in order to test the device",
    ", an air - grain interface was moved through the sensor and the output was recorded as a function of the location of the interface .",
    "this allowed one to determine that the measurement is averaged over a slice of the sample of typical thickness 2 mm parallel to the tube axis .",
    "the variation of the dc output with the particle fraction is assumed to be linear and the probes are calibrated by comparing readings obtained with an empty tube and with the same tube filled with a static bead packing .",
    "this assumption of a linear variation is frequently used in the literature : in the present case , it is particularly justified by the small particle fraction variations during the experiment and by the random , approximately isotropic structure of the packing . the particle fraction @xmath17 of the static bead packing obtained after filling the tube",
    "is assumed to be equal to 0.63 : this value corresponds to a _",
    "random close packing _ of spheres and is frequently obtained experimentally in similar systems .",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath17 has been realized but its precision is limited by the small amount of beads in the tube . a slightly lower value @xmath17=0.61@xmath10.02 was obtained ( this difference may be due to the small diameter of the tube increasing the influence of wall effects reducing locally the particle fraction ) . in view of the large uncertainty on this measurement ,",
    "the value 0.63 is retained in the following .",
    "the capacitance measurements can be performed at chosen heights by moving the sensors along the tube .",
    "the instantaneous outputs of four pressure and capacitance sensors are digitized simultaneously at a sampling frequency of up to 1khz by a spectral dynamics @xmath18 signal analyzer .",
    "time - averaged values of all pressure , capacitance and flow rates sensors are also recorded but at 1s intervals .",
    "the dynamical properties of the flow are studied from spatio - temporal diagrams constructed from appropriately assembling the output of a digital linear ccd camera .",
    "light intensity variations along a vertical line precisely aligned with the tube are recorded at sampling rates of 500 lines per second with a resolution of up to 2048 pixels ( the equivalent pixel size on the tube ranges from 10@xmath4 m to 500@xmath4 m depending on the magnification ) .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath19 images in which the @xmath20-axis represents time while the @xmath21-axis corresponds to distance along the tube .",
    "the flow regimes are controlled by adjusting the constriction at the bottom of the experimental tube .",
    "the compact flow regime is observed for narrow constrictions , at typical superficial velocities @xmath9 between 0.01ms@xmath22 and 0.08ms@xmath22 .",
    "narrowing further the bottom constriction leads to a blockage of the flow while density waves appear at higher flow rates .",
    "the typical aperture @xmath23 of the constriction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dessinmanip ] insert ) in the compact regime ranges from 1 to 2 mm ( or approximately from 6 to 12 bead diameters ) . in all cases ,",
    "the particle fraction in the compact regime does not differ by more than 0.02 from the particle fraction @xmath17 in a static packing .",
    "decreasing the relative humidity @xmath24 of the air down to 40% or using `` clean beads '' with a smooth surface , changes significantly the behavior of the grain flow : in this case , a continuous flow of grains is observed ( its velocity is roughly constant with time and of the order of a few centimeters per second ) . in return , for `` rougher beads '' or relative humidity @xmath2550% , the flow is intermittent and may remain blocked for a large fraction of the time , particularly near the hopper ( observations using a sem microscope display particles with a size of up to several micrometers at the surface of the `` rough beads '' with spacings increasing with the size from a few @xmath4 m up to a few 10@xmath4 m ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that these small particle fraction variations nevertheless induce large pressure drops ( up to 3000pa at the top of the tube ) .",
    "the decompaction process is indeed fast enough for air to undergo an isentropic expansion : pressure variations closely mirror the variations of the local particle fraction .",
    "diffusion of air through the grain packing is too slow to influence strongly that phase ; however , it plays an important role in the longer static phase by allowing the decay of the pressure towards equilibrium before flow is reinitiated .",
    "the characteristic time for air diffusion through the packing is of the order of the total period of the intermittent flow and may be a key factor determining its value",
    ".    the amplification effect can be reproduced by a 1d model assuming an effective driving force on the grains that increases with the deviation of the particle fraction from the static value .",
    "this numerical model also indicates that the permeability @xmath87 of the packing is a very important factor . the amplification effect ( and perhaps also the intermittent flows )",
    "should be observable only if @xmath87 is sufficiently low that pressure perturbations do not diffuse away too quickly .",
    "another important parameter is the relative humidity of the surrounding air which influence strongly the interaction forces both between the grains and between the grains and the tube walls .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the intermittent flow regime is rarely observed at relative humidities of the order of 40% or below , at least with the beads used in the present study .",
    "systematic studies in a broad range of relative humidities should greatly help understand better the interaction forces which determine the characteristics of these intermittent flows .",
