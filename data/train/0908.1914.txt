    "the smooth 4-dimensional poincar conjecture , that every homotopy 4-sphere is diffeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere @xmath0 , is perhaps the last of the great unsolved conjectures of classical manifold theory .",
    "it is widely believed to be false , largely because of the multitude of potential counterexamples .",
    "the best - known , and historically the most promising , family of potential counterexamples was constructed by cappell and shaneson in the 1970 s @xcite .",
    "these were indexed by an infinite family of matrices , together with a @xmath1 choice of a framing .",
    "the examples with the twisted choice of framing seemed the most intractable , hence , the most likely to be exotic @xmath0 s , especially since two of them were known to be double covers of exotic @xmath2 s @xcite .",
    "it took years of work with difficult kirby calculus computations to show by the late 1980 s that even the simplest of these was diffeomorphic to @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more kirby calculus @xcite yielded handle diagrams of an infinite family of such examples , published in 1991 , but no further progress was made until recently ( june 2009 ) , when akbulut @xcite found a simple proof that these diagrams all represent diffeomorphic manifolds , so they are @xmath0 by previous results . in the present paper , we show that a strictly larger family is @xmath0 .",
    "the work is still in progress , and may ultimately show that all cappell - shaneson homotopy spheres are @xmath0 , suggesting the intriguing possibility that the smooth 4-dimensional poincar conjecture may be true after all .",
    "our main technique is new , exploiting hidden symmetries of the original construction of cappell and shaneson .",
    "no kirby calculus is used in this paper , and the argument only depends on it through the relatively simple proof that appeared in @xcite in 1979 .",
    "as we will see , the cappell - shaneson homotopy 4-spheres are indexed by a @xmath1 framing choice and a conjugacy class of _ cappell - shaneson matrices _",
    "@xmath3 , defined by the condition @xmath4 .",
    "the most thoroughly studied subfamily is given by the matrices @xmath5.\\ ] ] these represent all possible values of the trace , and form a `` cofinite '' subfamily in the sense that each trace is realized by only finitely many conjugacy classes of cappell - shaneson matrices .",
    "( see section  [ cs ] and @xcite for further discussion . )",
    "the homotopy spheres corresponding to @xmath6 and the twisted framing arise as double covers of exotic @xmath2 s @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first progress in trivializing cappell - shaneson spheres was due to akbulut and kirby @xcite in 1979 , showing via kirby calculus that the example with @xmath7 and untwisted framing is @xmath0 .",
    "aitchison and rubenstein @xcite observed that this framing is not the one arising ( as claimed in @xcite ) from an exotic @xmath2 , and showed that for all @xmath8 the example with untwisted framing is standard .",
    "( they used different matrices , but those are easily seen to be conjugate to @xmath8 @xcite . )",
    "the twisted framings have been much harder .",
    "akbulut and kirby worked for 6 years on the @xmath7 case before publishing an elegant handle diagram of it with no 3-handles and only two 1-handles @xcite .",
    "this was then shown by the author to be diffeomorphic to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "that same paper exhibited handle decompositions of the cappell - shaneson spheres corresponding to all the matrices @xmath8 and twisted framing ; the derivation by a long sequence of kirby moves appeared in @xcite .",
    "these diagrams stood for two decades until a clever observation of akbulut @xcite showed they were all diffeomorphic to the @xmath7 case , and hence standard .",
    "the arguments trivializing the kirby diagrams of cappell - shaneson spheres with twisted framing all end with a similar trick , first seen in @xcite . in that example , an initial simplification of the diagram from @xcite ( following a group - theoretic computation generated by computer and simplified by akbulut and casson ) resulted in a diagram with two twist boxes .",
    "it soon became apparent that the numbers of twists could be varied , resulting in a family of homotopy spheres parametrized by @xmath9 ( not necessarily related to the cappell - shaneson examples , except for the case of interest , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 case was easily seen to be @xmath0 , so the crucial step was to show that the examples were all diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "this was accomplished by introducing a 2-handle/3-handle pair , with the attaching curve of the 2-handle appearing in a strategic location ( although unknotted in the @xmath12 obtained by surgery on the rest of the diagram ) .",
    "the 2-handle was then dragged around a torus embedded in a 3-manifold obtained by surgery on just some components , and returned to its original location .",
    "some handle slides were needed in order to move the 2-handle past another 2-handle , changing some twists , and hence @xmath13 , by 1 .",
    "recently , the author examined the proof in the upside - down handle picture , where it is relevant to generalizing property r. from this viewpoint , a 1-handle/2-handle pair is introduced , but the 2-handle again slides around an embedded torus to change twists .",
    "( this will appear in @xcite in the context of property r. ) akbulut s proof again introduces a 2 - 3 pair and runs the 2-handle around a torus to change @xmath14 by 1 .",
    "( in that case , one needs to strategically locate _ two _ circles that are unknotted in the surgered @xmath12 in order to find the whole torus  the author essentially did this in @xcite , but missed the crucial punch line ! )    these observations suggest a common underlying mechanism that we will exploit directly .",
    "the crucial feature of the examples above is an embedded @xmath15 with a 2-handle attached along an essential circle of @xmath16 .",
    "the framing of the 2-handle is @xmath17 in each case , so we obtain what is called a _",
    "fishtail neighborhood_. in the present paper , we go back to the original description of the cappell - shaneson manifolds and look for fishtail neighborhoods there .",
    "we then use symmetries of the fishtail neighborhoods to produce diffeomorphisms between examples corresponding to different conjugacy classes of matrices , with different traces .",
    "the main tool , theorem  [ twist ] , whose proof requires no handle diagrams , can be stated in the more general context of 4-manifolds with fibered 2-knots , and the author intends to study further consequences . in the present paper ,",
    "we apply this theorem and matrix algebra show that for many cappell - shaneson matrices , the resulting pair of homotopy spheres is diffeomorphic to the pair arising from the matrix @xmath18 .",
    "the latter two homotopy spheres are standard by @xcite for the untwisted framing and by @xcite for the twisted one .",
    "however , @xcite relies on a long and tricky sequence of handle moves beginning with @xcite , a result of years of study .",
    "section  [ framing ] is devoted to a direct proof via theorem  [ twist ] that the two cappell - shaneson spheres constructed from @xmath18 are diffeomorphic to each other . as a result ,",
    "the theorems in this paper only depend on kirby calculus through @xcite , in which one simple cappell - shaneson sphere ( from @xmath18 with untwisted framing ) is exhibited as a handle diagram that immediately cancels .",
    "section  [ framing ] can also be interpreted as an example showing that a gluck twist can sometimes be undone by exploiting symmetries of fishtail neighborhoods .",
    "the example seems somewhat special , however , involving several strategically placed fishtails .",
    "in fact , it sometimes is possible to create exotic smooth structures by gluck twists on spheres in 4-manifolds , at least in the nonorientable case @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are given in section  [ cs ] .",
    "example  [ am](a ) shows that the pairs of diffeomorphism types given by the matrices @xmath8 are independent of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , they are all the standard @xmath0 , and we recover the results of akbulut and aitchison - rubenstein .",
    "example  [ am](b ) then gives a previously unknown result , exhibiting a cappell - shaneson matrix not conjugate to any @xmath8 and showing that the resulting homotopy spheres are standard .",
    "the subsequent theorems then give large classes of cappell - shaneson matrices for which the corresponding homotopy spheres must be standard .",
    "these theorems are presumably not yet optimal , but already seem to indicate that if any exotic cappell - shaneson spheres exist , their matrices must have several moderately large entries ( corollary  [ entries ] ) .",
    "while conjugacy classes in @xmath19 can be understood using algebraic number theory , it seems difficult to relate that technology to specific families of cappell - shaneson matrices .",
    "we provide no further results about conjugacy classes , although there are presumably infinitely many beyond those of @xmath8 covered by the theorems .",
    "the difficulty of analyzing conjugacy classes suggests that matrix - level results such as theorems  [ mod d ] and [ mod a ] may be useful even for some matrices that are ( nonobviously ) conjugate to some @xmath8 . in any case",
    ", the author is still hoping to prove that all cappell - shaneson spheres are covered by these or similar results .",
    "the cappell - shaneson homotopy 4-spheres arise from the following construction .",
    "let @xmath20 be a connected , oriented 3-manifold with an orientation - preserving self - diffeomorphism @xmath21 .",
    "without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath21 restricts to the identity in a neighborhood of some point @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the mapping torus @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 descends to a circle @xmath26 with a canonical framing . for @xmath27 let @xmath28 be obtained from @xmath23 by surgery on @xmath29 with the canonical ( @xmath30 ) or the noncanonical ( @xmath31 ) framing .",
    "the cappell - shaneson examples arise when @xmath20 is the 3-torus , so @xmath21 is obtained from some @xmath3 , and @xmath28 is a homotopy 4-sphere if and only if @xmath32",
    ". however , our main tool applies in the general case :    [ twist ] for @xmath20 and @xmath21 as above , suppose there is an oriented circle @xmath33 containing @xmath34 , and a torus @xmath35 containing both @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in which the two circles have algebraic intersection @xmath38 with @xmath39 connected .",
    "suppose that the framings induced by @xmath40 on @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond under @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath41 denotes the dehn twist along @xmath40 parallel to @xmath42 , then @xmath43 for all @xmath44 and @xmath27 .    a more careful definition of @xmath45 is to identify a collar of @xmath40 in @xmath20 with @xmath46 so that the first @xmath47-factor is homologous to @xmath48-[\\alpha]$ ] , then take @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath34 lies on the boundary of the collar , we can assume it is outside the support of @xmath45 so that the framings on @xmath29 are undisturbed . strictly speaking",
    ", the notation should also specify the side of @xmath40 on which the collar lies , although the theorem applies to both . however , there is no ambiguity when @xmath50 as in the cappell - shaneson setting .",
    "the main idea of the proof is to locate a fishtail neighborhood in @xmath28 and invoke the following lemma .",
    "[ fishtail ] suppose @xmath51 is embedded in a 4-manifold @xmath52 .",
    "suppose there is a disk @xmath53 intersecting @xmath54 precisely in @xmath55 for some @xmath56 , and that the normal framing of @xmath57 in @xmath52 differs from the product framing on @xmath58 by @xmath38 twist .",
    "then the diffeomorphism type of @xmath52 does not change if we remove @xmath54 and reglue it by a @xmath59-fold dehn twist of @xmath60 along @xmath61 parallel to @xmath62 .",
    "this lemma is well - known in various forms .",
    "the resulting submanifold @xmath63 of @xmath52 is called a _",
    "fishtail neighborhood _ ( up to orientation ) and is a regular neighborhood of a sphere with a double point .",
    "the gluing operation is called a multiplicity-1 _ logarithmic transformation _ with direction @xmath64 and auxiliary multiplicity @xmath65 ( or in a different context , a _ luttinger surgery _ ) .",
    "the lemma is at the heart of the proof @xcite that simply connected elliptic surfaces with fixed @xmath66 are determined by their multiplicities .",
    "a different application appears in @xcite .",
    "we include a proof of the lemma for completeness .",
    "we can assume ( after isotopy ) that the gluing diffeomorphism is supported away from @xmath67 .",
    "thus , it extends by the identity over @xmath68 .",
    "it now suffices to see that the diffeomorphism extends over @xmath69 .",
    "the general case then follows from the case @xmath70 .",
    "interpret @xmath60 as the trivial @xmath71-bundle over the middle factor of @xmath54 , so that @xmath67 corresponds to the last factor of the fiber .",
    "adding the 2-handle to @xmath54 changes the boundary by @xmath38-surgery on @xmath67 .",
    "this , in turn , can be interpreted as changing the bundle monodromy on @xmath71 to a dehn twist @xmath72 along @xmath67 .",
    "( think of the tubular neighborhood of @xmath67 as an annulus in the fiber crossed with an interval in the base , then perform the surgery so that the gluing map is supported in a single fiber . )",
    "thus , we have identified @xmath68 with the bundle @xmath73 .",
    "the gluing diffeomorphism on @xmath68 specified by the lemma is a dehn twist parallel to @xmath67 along the torus descending from @xmath74 , namely @xmath72 on each fiber . to extend this over @xmath69 , work in a collar @xmath75 with the first factor parametrized by @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "then the diffeomorphism @xmath77 is the required one for @xmath78 and the identity for @xmath79 , so it extends as required .",
    "this last diffeomorphism of @xmath69 can also be described as isotoping the attaching circle @xmath67 around the torus @xmath61 and back to its original position .",
    "thus , it is the mechanism underlying the endgames of @xcite and @xcite and the examples of @xcite .",
    "identify @xmath20 with @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 ( via the product embedding ) descends to a cylinder in @xmath23 with embedded interior , containing the surgery circle @xmath29 determined by @xmath34 , and whose oriented boundary is @xmath82 . since @xmath21 is the identity near @xmath34 , the curves @xmath36 and @xmath37 intersect in an arc there , oriented compatibly . by hypothesis , they cross there and have no other intersections .",
    "thus , the image of the cylinder is a punctured torus @xmath83 embedded in @xmath23 , whose boundary @xmath84 is made from @xmath37 and @xmath85 by deleting the common segment  in particular , it is homologous to @xmath48-[\\alpha]$ ] in @xmath40 .",

    "this can be seen by explicitly constructing a disjoint parallel copy of @xmath90 in @xmath23 .",
    "since the framings induced by @xmath40 on @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond under @xmath21 , we can simply visualize this copy pushed away from @xmath83 toward the reader in figure  [ f ] , and note that its boundary is the dashed curve .",
    "the full twist of that curve about @xmath92 is retained when we slide it to @xmath60 along the collar @xmath91\\times \\partial f$ ] ( the fourth coordinate in the figure ) .",

    "the parallel copy of @xmath83 then determines the blackboard framing , which picks up a twist when we remove the crossing by a type i reidemeister move .",
    "having determined the framing induced by @xmath90 , we now recall that @xmath90 contains the surgery curve @xmath29 in its interior , so we may perform the surgery pairwise to obtain a disk @xmath97 for @xmath27 .",

    "[ proof of theorem  [ mod a ] ] we manipulate @xmath112 , ignoring its third column .",
    "in addition to our new move , we use elementary conjugations adding @xmath59 times row ( a ) to row ( b ) , then subtracting @xmath59 times column ( b ) from column ( a ) .",
    "( recall that row operations commute with column operations , since they are matrix multiplications on opposite sides . )",
    "it suffices to assume @xmath167 , after subtracting @xmath154 times the first column from the second , and the corresponding row operation that replaces @xmath153 by @xmath160 . without disturbing standard form with @xmath167 ,",
    "we can change the pair @xmath179 to either ( i )  @xmath180 or ( ii )  @xmath181 for any @xmath44 . for ( i ) , add @xmath59 times the first row to the second , with the corresponding column operation .",
    "the latter changes the first two entries of the first column , but these can be reset to 0 by row operations whose corresponding column operation only affects the third column .",

    "resetting @xmath154 to 0 as before completes the process .",
    "since @xmath153 is odd , both ( i ) and ( ii ) are nontrivial operations , except in the case @xmath184 . but this case is easy , since @xmath185 implies @xmath186 , and @xmath156 or @xmath187 implies @xmath188 , so @xmath189 . we can now invoke theorem  [ mod d ] or reduce to some @xmath8 by hand .",
    "( in fact , when @xmath185 , @xmath112 is already forced to be @xmath190 , after we possibly reverse the signs of the middle row and column . )    to complete the proof , it suffices to assume @xmath191 , by arranging this beforehand ( in the mod @xmath133 case ) or applying ( i ) and recalling that we replaced @xmath153 by @xmath160 when reducing to the @xmath167 case .",

    "all of our results showing that cappell - shaneson homotopy spheres are standard then depend on kirby calculus only through the original paper @xcite , which is far easier than @xcite followed by @xcite .",
    "another way of viewing this section is that gluck twists on fibered 2-knots can sometimes be undone by repeated application of theorem  [ twist ] .",
    "recall that the setup for theorem  [ twist ] requires the monodromy @xmath21 to fix a neighborhood of some point @xmath34 in the fiber @xmath20 .",
    "in the case of cappell - shaneson spheres , we use linear diffeomorphisms of @xmath111 , with fixed point @xmath197 at which the tangent space is not fixed . to apply the theorem , we must isotope the diffeomorphism rel 0 to fix a neighborhood of 0 .      when @xmath202 there are exactly two straightenings of @xmath112 , differing by an element of @xmath203 .",

    "( given another such isotopy @xmath211 , we can glue it to @xmath207 to obtain an isotopy from @xmath208 to @xmath212 for which the derivative at @xmath34 is a nullhomotopic path in @xmath213 . straightening the 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms near @xmath34",
    "gives the required isotopy . )",
    "thus , the two straightenings @xmath205 of @xmath206 canonically determine the two possible isotopy classes ( rel a neighborhood of @xmath34 ) of monodromies for the cappell - shaneson construction on @xmath210 , and hence the two resulting diffeomorphism types , which we denote by @xmath214 .",

    "any isotopy rel @xmath34 between diffeomorphisms @xmath21 and @xmath72 of @xmath219 determines such a @xmath216 from @xmath220 to @xmath221 , and @xmath222 .",
    "( glue the two isotopies and apply the above characterization . )    as our main example , let @xmath112 be a cappell - shaneson matrix , and suppose @xmath217 is obtained from @xmath112 as in theorem  [ twist ] .",
    "that is , after a change of basis , @xmath217 is obtained from @xmath112 by left- or right - multiplying it by a power @xmath223 of the matrix @xmath224 given in section  [ cs ] .",
    "the linear path from @xmath223 to @xmath201 clearly lies in @xmath225 .",
    "multiplying this by @xmath112 gives the linear path @xmath216 from @xmath217 to @xmath112 , showing that the latter path lies in @xmath225 , and linearity is preserved when we undo the change of basis .",
    "but @xmath217 is also a cappell - shaneson matrix , and in fact @xmath226 for each straightening @xmath205 . to see this",
    ", first note that theorem  [ twist ] applies , since the isotopy corresponding to each straightening of @xmath112 can be chosen to keep @xmath37 within the torus @xmath40 of that theorem , satisfying the required hypotheses .",
    "( the isotopies will differ by a full twist in the normal bundle of the curve . )",
    "recall that the diffeomorphism @xmath104 of theorem  [ twist ] , while isotopic to @xmath223 rel 0 , is actually supported away from 0 in a neighborhood of a torus .",
    "the isotopy can be taken to be linear in @xmath227 , and in particular its derivative is the linear straightening of @xmath223 at the tangent space at 0 .",
    "theorem  [ twist ] identifies @xmath228 with @xmath229 or @xmath230 ( both of which are well - defined since @xmath45 is supported away from 0 ) .",
    "our isotopy from @xmath104 to @xmath223 changes the bundle monodromy to @xmath217 while changing the straightening to @xmath231 ( for the linear @xmath216 discussed above ) , so @xmath226 by the previous paragraph .",
    "while aitchison and rubenstein @xcite gave a procedure for straightening any cappell - shaneson matrix , it suffices here to examine their simplest special case , when the straight line path lies in @xmath232 .",
    "we must show that the linear path from @xmath112 to @xmath201 lies in @xmath232 , i.e. , for @xmath235 we have @xmath236 .",
    "equivalently , we must show that there are no negative roots of the characteristic polynomial @xmath237 ( where the last expression comes from setting @xmath238 and comparing with the cappell - shaneson conditions ) .",
    "this , in turn , is the same as ruling out positive roots of @xmath239 , which is obvious for @xmath240 and not much harder for @xmath234 ( although we only need the case @xmath241 ) .",
    "although any change in monodromy arising from theorem  [ twist ] can be realized by left or right multiplication by some @xmath223 after a suitable change of basis , it will be convenient to have another example expressed without the basis change .",
    "suppose the cappell - shaneson matrix @xmath112 has second column given by @xmath244^t$ ] .",
    "then the second basis vector @xmath245 and @xmath246 span the integer lattice in the plane perpendicular to the third axis .",

    "of course , this follows from knowing that both manifolds are @xmath0 ( @xcite for the linear straightening of @xmath18 and @xcite , @xcite for the twisted straightening ) , but the point is to bypass @xcite , @xcite to conclude that many cappell - shaneson spheres are standard using only the relatively simple kirby calculus argument of @xcite .    starting with the cappell - shaneson matrix @xmath112 given below ,",
