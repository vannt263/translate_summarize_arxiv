    "in the last few decades large optical spectroscopic surveys have dramatically improved our knowledge of the global distribution of galaxy physical properties such as stellar mass , star formation rates , star formation histories , and both gas phase and stellar metallicities .",
    "furthermore , at low to intermediate redshifts , the sheer statistics of current optical spectroscopic surveys allow us to identify and study significant numbers of rare objects which represent transient phases in the lifetime of galaxies : starburst , post - starburst and `` green - valley '' galaxies , major mergers , and powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these transient phases , although rare , are globally important . for example , black hole growth occurs primarily in rare , high accretion rate events @xcite , and it is still debated whether the infrequent gas - rich galaxy major mergers are responsible for the morphological transformation of galaxies and the build - up of the red sequence @xcite . in the near future , the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) will allow rest - frame optical spectroscopic observations at high - redshift , where galaxies are more active in both star formation and black hole growth .",
    "there is an obvious benefit in using the information provided in the redshift survey to study the properties of the galaxies in detail .",
    "for example , when star formation is the dominant mechanism of excitation , @xmath0  is a very simple and reliable measure of star formation rate in galaxies .",
    "however , it must be accurately corrected for dust attenuation . in ordinary galaxies ,",
    "the tight relations between dust - corrected @xmath0  and other indicators of star formation rate from other wavelength regimes provide circumstantial evidence that dust attenuation in the optical can be corrected for accurately .",
    "@xcite suggests that errors on sfrs caused by the assumed dust curve ( attenuation as a function of wavelength ) can be @xmath110 - 20% for typical star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "however , knowing the `` correct '' dust curve is crucial .",
    "@xcite find that the use of different dust curves in spectral - energy - distribution ( sed ) fitting of high redshift k - selected galaxies can alter parameters such as star formation rates and star formation timescales by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "the large errors reported in this study result from the fact that the `` correct '' dust - curve to use at high redshift is largely unconstrained and there is a large range in the steepness of dust - curves observed along lines - of - sight to stars in the magellanic clouds and milky way .    with the complex physical processes that occur during transient phases in the life - cycle of a galaxy ,",
    "it is uncertain how far rest - frame optical studies alone can help us in understanding their true impact .",
    "as dust content increases , and galaxy geometries become more complicated , corrections for dust attenuation become more uncertain .",
    "how much physical information can we really infer from optical data alone when faced with extreme star formation , dust production , agn activity and complicated spatial geometries of disturbed galaxies ?    in this paper , we compare emission line fluxes in the optical to those in the mid infra - red where dust attenuation is negligible , except in small and well known wavelength bands . to test the recovery of @xmath0luminosity from optical data in the presence of significant dust , we compare and contrast a low - z `` representative '' sample of galaxies with ( i ) dusty galaxies selected from the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) based on their balmer emission line ratios and strong balmer absorption lines indicating a possible recent decrease in star formation ; ( ii ) local _ ultra - luminous infrared galaxies _ ( ulirgs ) selected from the _ infrared astronomy satellite _ ( iras ) bright galaxy sample ( bgs ) based on their total ir luminosities ( l@xmath2 ) .",
    "the control sample of galaxies arise from the spitzer - sdss - galex spectroscopic survey ( ssgss ) and were chosen to be `` representative '' of the ordinary galaxies within the sdss and galex surveys . for the agn in these samples",
    ", we further compare the /  line ratio to a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies , to test the recovery of black hole accretion rates from optical  emission line . in a companion paper",
    "we will address the effect of dust on the optical continuum , and thus estimations of star formation histories , and compare the star formation rates derived from the multi - wavelength continuum with those from @xmath0  luminosity .",
    "understanding our selected `` unusual '' galaxies is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "the  galaxies show optical emission lines indicating obscured agn , and the correction of their  emission for dust attenuation using different dust - curves results in them contributing between an insignificant @xmath31% and a much more significant @xmath310% to the total  luminosity ( or black hole accretion rate ) of all narrow - line agn in the sdss .",
    "this has important implications for the starburst - agn connection , for example , as the strong balmer absorption lines suggest this accretion is happening after the starburst has decayed @xcite .",
    "low - z ulirgs are usually associated with major gas - rich mergers @xcite .",
    "some models of galaxy evolution have used gas - rich major mergers as the driving force to change the observational properties of the galaxy population over cosmic time .",
    "the mergers lead to powerful starbursts and qso driven outflows , resulting in the population of red , quiescent ellipticals seen in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ulirgs become increasingly common at earlier epochs , and dominate the star formation rate density beyond a @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "understanding the basic properties of ulirgs at low - redshift , and the limitations of the optical wavelength regime for identifying and understanding the properties of their power sources , is crucial in an era when near - infrared ( nir ) ground - based spectrographs and the jwst will soon allow us to study galaxies with rest - frame optical spectra at increasingly early epochs .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "after briefly reviewing the topic of dust extinction and attenuation in section [ sec : review ] , we present the spectral analysis methods and four samples in detail in section [ sec : samples ] . in section [ sec : results ] we compare the data with a variety of different dust curves commonly used in the literature .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : disc ] by discussing the implications of our work for measuring star formation rates , black hole accretion rates , and identifying agn in optical spectroscopic surveys .",
    "finally , we provide relations for correcting the , and @xmath0  emission lines using a measured @xmath0/@xmath5  flux ratio ( balmer decrement ) , assuming a single dust curve which provides a good fit to all of the samples studied in this paper .    throughout the paper we quote line luminosities in erg / s and masses in solar masses .",
    "optical parameters for all samples have been extracted from the sdss - dr7 , and may differ from those in earlier releases due to updates in the sdss reduction pipeline .",
    "all optical wavelengths are quoted as measured in a vacuum , in keeping with sdss convention , optical wavelengths are given in   and mid - ir wavelengths in @xmath6 .",
    "dust grains in galaxies which intercept and scatter stellar and nuclear light complicate the analysis of integrated galaxy spectra .",
    "optical light reaching the observer is effected by dust in three different ways : ( i ) absorption ; ( ii ) scattering out of the line - of - sight ; ( iii ) scattering into the line - of - sight . the first two",
    "combined are usually termed `` extinction '' and all three combined are termed `` attenuation '' .",
    "the final `` effective attenuation '' observed in the integrated light of galaxies results from the integration of attenuated light over all lines - of - sight to light sources throughout the entire galaxy . in this section ,",
    "we introduce the basics of the effects of dust on studying the integrated light from galaxies .",
    "@xcite gives an extensive recent review of the literature , although note that the terminology differs in places from that adopted here .",
    "the effective attenuation @xmath7 , in magnitudes , at a given wavelength @xmath8 is given by : @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the observed luminosity , @xmath11 is the intrinsic luminosity of the source , and @xmath12 is the effective optical depth of the dust .",
    "observationally we measure the dimming and reddening of light from sources , thus deriving an effective attenuation or extinction curve @xmath13 : @xmath14 where the colour excess is defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the total - to - selective extinction in the @xmath17 band . in the case of extinction ,",
    "r@xmath18 is a function of the grain composition , size and shape . in the case of effective attenuation observed in galaxies",
    "it is additionally a function of the local geometry of the dust and light sources and global geometry of the galaxy ( bulge and disk , and inclination ) . in this work",
    "we will use the term `` dust curve '' to mean either `` effective attenuation '' or `` extinction '' curve , depending on the particular curve under discussion .",
    "the effective attenuation suffered by the ultra - violet ( uv ) to optical stellar continua of starburst galaxies , where the unattenuated stellar continuum is relatively well understood , has been measured empirically from the ratio of heavily attenuated to less attenuated spectra @xcite .",
    "the dust - curve is found to be `` greyer '' ( i.e. flatter ) than extinction curves measured along single lines - of - sight towards stars in the milky way , as expected from geometrical effects .",
    "similarly , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cf00 ) fit the ratio of far infra - red ( fir ) to uv luminosities and uv slope in starburst galaxies to find an effective attenuation curve that is well fit by the shallow powerlaw @xmath19 .",
    "dust curves derived from stellar continua are not necessarily suitable for the correction of nebular emission lines , however . in starburst galaxies ,",
    "nebular emission lines are found to be more attenuated than the stellar continua ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the light passes through a greater quantity , and possibly different distribution or composition , of dust . any difference in the distribution or composition of dust will result in a different shape for the dust attenuation curve and therefore errors in the correction of nebular emission lines using a dust - curve derived from the stellar continua .",
    "the stronger attenuation of nebular emission lines compared to the stellar continuum , can be successfully reproduced by models in which dust is distributed primarily in 2 components : diffuse interstellar dust , and stellar birthclouds which disperse after a finite time ( @xmath20 years ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this allows the emission lines , which are ionised by the hottest stars still enveloped in their dense birthclouds , to experience greater attenuation than the uv stellar continua , which has an additional contribution from cooler stars around which the birthclouds have already dispersed .    in wild et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we presented explicitly the form of the dust - curve for the correction of nebular emission lines in the cf00 dust model : @xmath21 we reiterate that we use @xmath22 to refer to the final `` effective attenuation '' suffered by light , including geometrical effects , and that this model is strictly an `` angle averaged '' model , averaging over all sight - lines through a galaxy .",
    "the first term describes the slope of the screen - like extinction suffered as the light leaves the stellar birth - clouds and the exponent is set to match the extinction observed along lines - of - sight in the mw ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the second term describes the additional , much greyer attenuation caused by the intervening diffuse ism , where cf00 derive a best - fit exponent of @xmath24 .",
    "the fraction of the total effective optical depth at 5500caused by dust in the diffuse ism is controlled by the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "cf00 showed that the typical value for @xmath25 in their starburst dataset was about 0.3 .",
    "the resulting model attenuation curve , labelled @xmath26 throughout the paper , naturally lies between the pure continuum @xmath19 attenuation ( equivalent to @xmath27 ) , and pure screen - like attenuation ( equivalent to @xmath28 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite applied and extended the two component cf00 dust model to a sample of local galaxies with multi - wavelength photometry and optical @xmath0  and @xmath5  emission line measurements , finding an excellent match to the data .",
    "we note that an additional complication arises in the case of nebular emission from the narrow line region ( nlr ) of an agn , where a different dust geometry could lead to a different effective attenuation curve than that found for nebular emission from hiiregions . additionally , for galaxies with contributions to nebular emission from both star formation and an agn nlr , the use of the balmer decrement for the correction of nlr emission lines may be somewhat inappropriate . in general it is reasonably assumed that the hydrogen recombination lines are dominated by the emission from hiiregions in all but the strongest agn .",
    "however , this is not the case for higher ionization and higher excitation lines where emission from the nlr can dominate .",
    "thus , while the balmer decrement will show how much dust is in hii  regions , there is no reason to believe that light from the nlr would pass through the same amount of dust .",
    "therefore the extinction correction applied to these other lines , such as [ ] @xmath29 , may be incorrect .",
    "we investigate these effects in section [ sec : bhar ] .      in order to determine the amount of attenuation suffered by optical nebular emission lines , ideally one would observe a pair of lines",
    "whose intrinsic ratio is independent of physical conditions and where one of the pair lies at a wavelength long enough that attenuation is negligible ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "hydrogen recombination line ratios that include one line in the nir wavelength range have been shown to be a powerful tool for constraining the dust attenuation curves for nebular emission lines in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the data are well fit by a screen - like mw extinction curve , which has since been favoured for the correction of emission lines for dust attenuation .",
    "these results suggest that a substantial fraction of the attenuation of emission lines must arise from dust in a foreground screen - like geometry ( e.g. the birthclouds in the cf00 model ) .",
    "however , the samples studied to date have been small , containing only local starburst galaxies . extending this study to a larger sample of galaxies , including more ordinary starforming galaxies and dustier galaxies",
    "is the purpose of this paper .",
    "sample sizes using ground based nir observations are restricted primarily by the difficulty resulting from contamination of observations by oh sky lines",
    ". _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations of nir paschen-@xmath30 line have been used to reveal the detailed distribution of star formation in galaxies relatively unimpeded by dust @xcite . the detection of dust lanes in some galaxies in this sample",
    "indicate some level of extinction still exists even at 1.875@xmath6 .",
    "uncertainties in the form of dust - curve in the nir regime therefore cause a small additional source of uncertainty when using nir emission lines to constrain dust - curves in the optical .    with the launch of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board , high quality , moderate resolution mid - ir spectra are available for the first time for a large number of low-@xmath31 galaxies .",
    "extinction in the mid - ir is negligible , except in small wavelength regions centered on 9.7 and 18@xmath6  where strong absorption can arise from the stretching and bending modes of amorphous silicate grains .",
    "while h recombination lines are found in the mid - ir , they unfortunately tend to be too weak to be easily measured .",
    "two of the strongest and easily observable emission lines in the mid - ir arise from neon ; [ neii ]  12.8@xmath6  and [ neiii ]  15.5@xmath6 . in typical hii  regions , over 95% of neon is in these two states ( ne@xmath32 and ne@xmath33 ) , thus we expect that the sum of these two lines will trace very well the ionized gas , and thus @xmath0 , in galaxies .",
    "indeed , @xcite have already suggested that these mid - ir neon lines could provide a useful new indicator of star formation rate in galaxies .",
    "they have shown that [ neii]+[neiii]luminosity correlates strongly with both total infrared luminosity in galaxies and the nir br@xmath30 emission line in giant hiiregions . @xcite",
    "have shown that [ neii]luminosity correlates strongly with that of pa@xmath30 in star - forming regions in lirgs .",
    "neon has the added benefit of being an abundant element , especially as it is not depleted onto dust grains .",
    "therefore in this work we use the sum of these two lines as a tracer of the _ unextinguished _ emission from ionized gas in these galaxies .",
    "although these lines lie on the edge of the silicate absorption features , in general the extinction caused by this is minimal as we verify in section [ sec : samples ] .",
    "combining spitzer spectra with optical sdss spectra provides a new and extremely powerful dataset , in which both optical and mid - ir emission lines have been measured much more accurately than was possible in the past .",
    "starburst / hii  region modelling @xcite suggests that for typical twice solar metallicity hii  regions , the ratio l([neii]+[neiii])/l(@xmath0 ) should be between 0.5 - 1.0 , demonstrating how luminous the mid - ir ne lines are .",
    "the range is caused by ionization effects , arising from different stellar models , the mean age of the ionizing stellar population , and ionizing flux densities .",
    "there is one major disadvantage of using the [ ne]-to-@xmath0  ratio to constrain the optical dust - curve in galaxies , in that the intrinsic ratio is directly dependent upon the metallicity of the gas , greatly expanding the range of possible values . for solar metallicity hii  regions",
    "the models predict l([neii]+[neiii])/l(@xmath0 ) should be smaller by a factor of 0.6 .",
    "however , we expect that this is not a dominant concern in the samples studied in this paper as we are exploring massive , dusty , and therefore metal - rich , galaxies .",
    "we discuss the impact of variations in the intrinsic ratio where relevant .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details on the formation of the neon lines in hii  regions .    in agn",
    "the ionizing spectrum is much harder than found in star - forming regions , meaning that neon starts to populate higher ionization states .",
    "the sum of the mid - ir neon lines still traces the ionized gas very well , but the ionisation is offset to higher values due to the harder radiation field .",
    "in addition , the harder radiation field of agn also create partially ( or x - ray ) ionized regions , which have a higher l([[neii]])/l(@xmath0 ) ratio .",
    "agn photoionization models suggest l([neii]+[neiii])/l(@xmath0 ) @xmath34 , a factor of 2 - 4 higher than hiiregions @xcite .",
    "again , we will indicate the effect of this result where relevant .",
    "in this section we give the methodology used to measure the nebular emission lines , followed by the selection criteria of our four samples of galaxies .",
    "all samples have sdss optical 5-band imaging and fibre spectroscopy , together with spitzer irs spectroscopy .",
    "the sdss specobjid , sdss - mpa rowindex , ra and dec of the , ulirg and seyfert samples are given in tables [ tab : psb ] , [ tab : ul ] and [ tab : sey ] to allow easy identification of the objects in the catalogues used in this paper .",

    "* ) , and in figure [ fig : spoon ] we place all our samples on the @xcite diagram of equivalent width vs. the strength of the 9.7@xmath6  silicate absorption .",
    "we discuss these figures further in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the raw optical emission - line measurements for all sdss - dr7 galaxies are provided on the sdss - mpa web pages and details are given in @xcite and @xcite ; errors have been rescaled according to the information provided on the web site .",
    "note that all broad emission line objects have been identified by the sdss automated pipeline and are not included within the sdss - mpa sample .",
    "briefly , spectral synthesis models [ bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ; 2008 version using the miles spectral library , snchez - blzquez et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) ] are used to fit the stellar continuum , including stellar absorption features , and emission lines are measured from the residual of the data and model fit .",
    "therefore _ underlying stellar absorption is accurately accounted for when measuring optical emission line fluxes_. intervening galactic extinction is corrected for prior to the calculation of the emission line fluxes .",
    "the quality of the fits obtained is excellent .",
    "for all samples , irs spectroscopy was carried out in staring mode and 1d spectra were extracted using the standard spitzer irs custom extraction ( spice ) . for the  galaxies",
    "the `` optimal extraction '' option was chosen @xcite , which weights the extraction by the object profile and the signal - to - noise of each pixel and is suitable for faint sources .",
    "individual 1d spectra were combined using custom algorithms .    to maximise consistency between the heterogeneous samples in this paper , the final low - resolution 1d spectra of all samples were reanalysed using the same custom algorithms and analysis packages where appropriate . to obtain  and  fluxes for the ssgss and seyfert samples we used the mid - ir spectral fitting package pahfit ( v1.2 *",

    "however , comparing line strengths from the irs spectra with those from the sdss spectra leads to other aperture related issues .",
    "the finite ( and different ) slit and fibre apertures may mean that the irs and sdss spectra sample a different fraction of the same galaxy , and this will cause measured line ratios to differ from the true values .",
    "there are two important issues : ( i ) light is lost from the slit / fibre due to the psf ; ( ii ) light is lost from the outer regions of extended sources , depending on the size of the aperture and the accurate positioning of the aperture on the source . in this paper",
    "the precise flux calibration between the two datasets is relatively unimportant , but it is still important that we minimise any additional scatter in the observed relations . to help the reader to understand the limitations of our data , we outline here the flux calibration procedures of the mid - ir and optical spectra .",

    "the spectral extraction procedure accounts for the varying psf along the slit by normalising the flux at each wavelength according to the fraction of light missed from a calibration stellar point - source .",
    "the sdss dr7 spectra have been spectrophotometrically calibrated using the psf magnitudes of stars observed on the same plate as the galaxies @xcite . to aid aperture corrections ,",
    "the sdss - mpa emission line measurements have been recalibrated to the 3  fibre magnitudes . therefore , to match the stellar psf - normalised mid - ir spectra , we have removed this recalibration , returning the flux level of the sdss emission lines to the stellar psf - normalised values .",
    "the use of stellar psf spectrophotometric calibration for both optical and mid - ir spectra allows good relative calibration for point sources , but inaccuracies will still arise in the case of extended sources . for centrally concentrated sources , such as circumnuclear starbursts in ulirgs or agn nlr emission ,",
    "the point - source approximation is a good one .",
    "however , for extended sources , the measured mid - ir to optical line ratios may depend on the relative size of the apertures , and the relative surface brightness distribution of the sources .",
    "both effects are difficult to correct for accurately , especially in the case of radial differences within the sources ( for example , in agn vs. starforming nebular emission ) .",
    "we have therefore not attempted any further aperture correction , and will caution the reader at points in the text where this effect may be relevant .",
    "in figure [ fig : neha ] we plot @xmath0  vs. @xmath61(from now on [ ne ] ) luminosities for all of the samples , firstly with @xmath0  uncorrected for dust attenuation , and then corrected with five different dust - curves selected from the literature to cover the full range in possible greyness .",

    "for the seyfert sample and @xmath26 dust curve the mean offset is 1.26 , i.e. about a 25% enhancement in [ ne ] for their @xmath0  luminosity .",
    "the magnitude of this offset does not correlate with position on the bpt diagram or pah equivalent width , although the size of the sample is too small to rule out the possibility that those with a smaller offset have a greater contribution to star formation in their lines .",
    "averaged over the samples , the offset is seen only for the seyfert galaxies , and the three ssgss - agn which lie in or close to the seyfert region on the bpt diagram .",
    "the ssgss composite sample have a mean of 1 for all dust - curves , which suggests that the agn in general does not contribute significantly to the ne/@xmath0  line ratio in these composite galaxies .",
    "however , the trend upwards at low @xmath0  luminosities is driven by composite objects , suggesting there may be a small effect at low star formation rates .",
    "the observed average enhancement in the [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio of the ulirgs noted above , could be due to small number statistics , the dust curve ( i.e. a shallower dust curve would be more appropriate ) , or the presence of deeply buried agn .",
    "we note that the ulirgs are only offset by at most a factor of 3 , i.e. dust corrected @xmath0  luminosity tracks mid - ir [ ne ] luminosity to better than a factor of 3 even in extreme dusty and disturbed objects .",
    "we will return to these points below .",
    "the maximum likelihood fits provide a measure of the dust - free ratio of [ ne ] to @xmath0  luminosity in our irs / sdss datasets , when star formation is the dominant excitation mechanism for the line emission : @xmath68 } = g\\times{\\rm l(h\\alpha)_{corr}}\\ ] ] where l[ne ] = l()+l ( ) and @xmath69 for the mw , @xmath26 and calzetti dust - curves respectively . while it is encouraging that the measured intrinsic ratio lies exactly at the center of the range predicted by the models for twice solar metallicity hii  regions ( see section [ sec : nir ] ) , a precise comparison between models and data would only be possible after much greater care has been taken to perform precise aperture corrections . in the case of the agn ,",
    "the emission line source is point - like and therefore the relative calibration between the mid - ir and optical spectra should be the most accurate .",
    "the fact that the average [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio is a little lower than predicted may be due to contamination by star formation in a subset of the seyfert sample ( see section [ sec : comparison ] ) .    in the following subsection we study the differences between the dust curves in more detail .          in fig",

    "the intrinsic [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio is set from the fit to the ssgss - starforming galaxies as described above .",
    "although there are several factors which can move galaxies within this diagram , dust has the strongest effect , increasing both the balmer decrement and observed [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio by an order of magnitude over the range probed by our samples .",
    "the different dust - curves predict different relations between these two line ratios , even when we allow the intrinsic [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio to be a free parameter fit by the data .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the mw , @xmath26 and calzetti dust - curves provide the best fits to the ssgss - starforming galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : dustlaws ] shows that the @xmath26 and calzetti attenuation curves also pass through the center of the sample .",
    "the scatter of the ssgss - starforming galaxies about the best - fit dust - curves is large , and this may have several origins .",
    "firstly , the errors on the line flux measurements , particularly in @xmath5  are significant .",
    "secondly , we expect some variation due to different metallicities .",
    "the grey shaded region shows the range predicted by the theoretical models for twice solar hii  regions , and the arrow in the left hand panel shows how this region moves for solar hiiregions .",
    "the 3 galaxies with the lowest measured [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio lie significantly to the left of the @xmath70 prediction , but within the @xmath71 prediction .",
    "these 3 galaxies also have some of the highest /@xmath5  and [ neiii]/[neii ]  ratios of the sample , indicative of harder ionisation perhaps resulting from lower metallicity star formation . the single seyfert galaxy with a [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio less than 1 has the lowest /@xmath0",
    "ratio of the whole sample , unusually low for seyfert galaxies , and likely associated with accretion of low - metallicity gas @xcite .",
    "while low metallicities can explain the scatter of ssgss - starforming galaxies to the left of the dust - curve predictions , the scatter to the right is unlikely to be caused by metallicity variations as scatter in this direction requires significant and unlikely neon abundance increases ( i.e.  greater than twice solar ) .",
    "this leads us to the third , and most interesting , cause for scatter in the line ratio relation : intrinsic differences in the type or distribution of dust in galaxies .",
    "in a 2-component dust model , increasing the fraction of dust in the diffuse ism relative to the dense birthclouds increases the contribution from scattering and makes the dust - curve greyer . in the cf00 emission line dust model given in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : w07 ] this relative amount of diffuse vs. dense dust is controlled by the parameter @xmath25 . by increasing @xmath25 to 0.9",
    "( i.e. 90% of the effective optical depth from the dust comes from the ism , and 10% from the stellar birthclouds ) , we can describe the lower envelope of the ssgss galaxies . while this qualitative result is suggestive , a further detailed study including orientation , metallicity and ionisation effects would be required to confirm that these galaxies do indeed have a significantly different dust geometry .",
    "it is evident that the 3 ulirgs classified as composite galaxies by their optical line ratios also appear to favour a greyer dust curve than the dusty  galaxies .",
    "however , as we discuss further below , it is also plausible that the high ne/@xmath0  ratio observed in these ulirgs , as well as in some ssgss - composite galaxies , is simply due to a deeply buried agn .",
    "we summarise the results up to this point by noting that a single appropriate dust curve , combined with an accurately measured balmer decrement , can recover the intrinsic optical emission line luminosities to better than a factor of two in the majority of ordinary starforming and dusty galaxies .",
    "our data shows that this remains true for galaxies with dust contents up to an @xmath72 of 4.4 .",
    "however , while the use of a mw , @xmath26 or calzetti dust - curves for large samples of galaxies will cause the least overall bias in the final dust - corrected emission line luminosities , the effect of a greyer dust - curve in individual galaxies should not be understated .",
    "a galaxy with a very typical measured @xmath0/@xmath5  ratio of 4.5 would have its @xmath0  luminosity , and thus star - formation rate , corrected by a factor of around 2.5 using the average dust curve , whereas a factor of 7 would be more appropriate if the majority of its dust were in the diffuse ism .      throughout the remainder of the paper we will focus on results using the cf00 @xmath25 dust - curve as it allows greater flexibility than the traditional dust - curves in the calculation of errors , and the discussion of variations in dust - curves within the sample as presented in the previous section .",
    "additionally , it is the only dust - curve specifically motivated and justified for the correction of nebular emission lines .",
    "the mw dust - curve assumes a screen - like dust distribution , and the calzetti dust - curve is intended for correcting the continuum light from galaxies . rather than assuming @xmath73",
    "as derived by cf00 , we can fit the [ ne ] vs. @xmath0  luminosities of the ssgss - starforming galaxies to obtain the best - fit @xmath25 and intrinsic [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio together with errors .",
    "we use a maximum - likelihood linear fit , accounting for errors on both quantities , and fix the intercept to be zero .",
    "formal , statistical errors on the derived @xmath25 are at the level of 5% .",
    "the errors obtained from bootstrap resampling with replacement of the data are more significant , and we quote these errors below , and use them to obtain errors on the dust correction formulae presented in section [ sec : sfr ] and [ sec : bolcorrn ] .    we find @xmath74 , i.e. on average 40% of the optical depth at 5500  arises in the ism of the galaxies .",
    "this is consistent within the errors with the @xmath73 derived by cf00 for their sample of local starburst galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio fit at the same time is @xmath75 .",

    "importantly for this section , it is evident from the many theoretical models that _ any _ significant silicate absorption , as found in the ulirgs and many of the  galaxies , implies optical extinction at levels of @xmath82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the dotted line is the best - fit squared relation to the ssgss - starforming , composite and  galaxies : @xmath87    in the case of starforming galaxies without a strong agn , the mid - ir continuum predominantly arises from dust grains situated within the hii  regions re - radiating the light from young and hot stars .",
    "it is this dust continuum that is absorbed by the silicate grains along the line - of - sight between the light source and the observer .",
    "balmer emission lines also come from ionised gas within hii  regions .",
    "thus , the observed correlation between the silicate absorption strength and balmer decrement implies either : ( i ) a correlation between the amount of dust in dense stellar birth clouds which cause the silicate absorption , and the amount of dust in more diffuse stellar birth clouds which cause the absorption of the optical emission lines ; or ( ii ) a self - similar structure for hii  regions in which the balmer lines that reach the observer have passed through a fixed fraction of the dense dust clouds .",

    "models have shown that extremely strong silicate absorption , as observed in these two ulirgs , requires a steep temperature gradient within the obscuring cloud , which can only be obtained where the light source responsible for heating the dust that causes the mid - ir continuum is deeply buried in a smooth thick shell of dust that is both geometrically and optically thick @xcite .",
    "this is again consistent with the source being an agn , although a nuclear starburst may suffice .",
    "a clumpy distribution of dust leads to much shallower absorption or emission @xcite .",
    "our emission line analysis is also consistent with these galaxies harbouring a buried agn , they have an increased [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio and lie in the composite region of the bpt diagram . while the position of these galaxies on the bpt diagram is not in itself conclusive proof that these two ulirgs harbour an agn , if their position is caused by the agn then it indicates that ionising radiation from the agn escapes to ionise the nlr , despite the dense dust cloud that presumably surrounds the central continuum source .",
    "two dusty seyfert galaxies and one ulirg with a seyfert nucleus ( mrk273 ) also lie above the relation defined by the ssgss and  galaxies , further supporting the idea that dust along the line - of - sight to a deeply buried agn can lead to stronger silicate absorption , relative to nebular line absorption , than normal hiiregions .",
    "we are not aware of any models which simultaneously predict the strength of silicate absorption and attenuation of the optical emission lines .",
    "qualitatively figure [ fig : dust ] suggests a two component model is required to describe the dust distribution in galaxies / agn .",
    "the lower branch is consistent with silicate absorption arising in the clumpy distribution of stellar birthclouds , with the densest clouds causing some silicate absorption , and the balmer emission lines originating from the same star formation regions but further out in the clouds .",
    "the upwards scatter of some sources from this branch is consistent with the dust being concentrated in a dense shell - like distribution obscuring a single nuclear source , most likely an agn in the cases studied here , but also conceivably a strong nuclear starburst .          as explained in section [ sec : nir ] , a dust curve and accurate balmer decrement that adequately corrects hii  region emission lines for dust attenuation , will not necessarily do the same for lines from the nlr of agn . particularly in composite objects ,",
    "a higher fraction of balmer lines will arise from within the hii  regions of the galaxy compared to lines such as  which are stronger in nlrs .",
    "therefore a form of differential extinction might arise between the balmer and higher ionisation lines , and a corresponding bias in the correction of agn nlr lines for dust using the measured balmer decrement .",
    "additionally , the form of the dust curve may not be the same for light originating from hii  regions and from an agn nlr , due to the different relative geometry between the light source and the dust cloud , and the different balance between dense and diffuse dust attenuating the lines .",
    "the mid - ir  line at 25.89 @xmath6  has been shown to be an accurate indicator of agn power @xcite , and the /  ratio a possible measure of agn attenuation . in this section",
    "we test the accuracy of dust - corrected  as a measure of agn luminosity in our sources by comparing to the mid - ir  line .    in figure",
    "[ fig : oiiioiv ] we plot dust - uncorrected and dust - corrected  vs.  for the seyferts , the 3 galaxies and the 2 ulirgs with measured  lines .",
    "note that the correlation coefficient is similar for the seyferts whether the dust correction is performed or not .",
    "these seyferts have very small balmer decrements so the dust correction has only a small effect .",
    "because some of these objects are classified as composite agn - starformation by their optical line ratios , and  is also produced by starformation , in the right hand panel we apply a correction for this following the method of @xcite , based on the expected /@xmath0",
    "ratio for metal - rich starforming galaxies luminosity . ] .",
    "is also produced in hii  regions , although the contamination is expected to be much smaller than for  due to the higher ionisation level .",
    "clearly , there is a tight correlation between dust - corrected  and  for the seyfert sample ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "all of the dusty galaxies and ulirgs with measured  fall within a factor of 3 of the relation defined by the seyferts .",
    "only the upper limit for arp220 is marginally inconsistent with the relation defined by the seyfert galaxies .",
    "taking the remainder of the  galaxies and stacking the sh spectra in luminosity units shows a clear  line , which we fit together with the neighbouring feii  line using a double gaussian .",
    "the corresponding stacked -  luminosity also lies exactly on the seyfert relation , once contamination of  from star formation has been accounted for .",
    "errors are estimated from the standard deviation of the luminosity on removing one spectrum at a time from the stack .",
    "this strong correlation between  and dust corrected using the observed balmer decrement and dust - curve appropriate for hii  regions , for even dusty composite galaxies , shows that there is no evidence for significant differential extinction between lines emitted from the nlr and hii  regions of a galaxy .",
    "although slightly surprising , this may imply that the majority of dust attenuation suffered by nlr emission lines comes from the diffuse dust and hii  regions in the intervening galaxy , through which they must pass on their way to the observer .",
    "unfortunately neither of the two ulirgs with extreme silicate absorption ( 08572 and 15250 ) have measured , so we can not test directly whether optical and mid - ir nlr lines agree even in the presence of extreme , dense obscuration of the central light source .",
    "such a study may be possible with the large samples of ulirgs now available in archives .",
    "the potential of dust attenuation and complicated dust geometries to render useless optical observations of extreme galaxies is sometimes used to justify rest - frame ir observations . in the previous sections",
    "we have used the correlation between the unattenuated mid - ir and attenuated optical nebular emission lines to argue that a single dust curve can accurately correct optical emission lines for dust attenuation in a large range of different galaxies .",
    "the correction is accurate to within a factor of 2 in most cases , and to at least a factor of 4 for even the most heavily obscured ulirgs .    here",
    ", we discuss the implications of our work for deriving sfrs and black hole accretion rates from the optical emission lines @xmath0 , , and . we present useful relations for dust corrections at the wavelengths of each of these lines .",
    "the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : atten ] show the fractional attenuation ( in flux units ) as a function of observed balmer decrement at @xmath0  and , for each of the different dust curves discussed in section [ sec : results ] . using the best - fit @xmath80 dust curve ,",
    "the recommended correction at @xmath0  is : @xmath88_{corr } } = { \\rm l[h\\alpha]_{obs}}\\left(\\frac{\\rm ( h\\alpha / h\\beta)_{obs}}{b}\\right)^{2.67_{-0.32}^{+0.40}}\\ ] ] and at : @xmath89_{corr } } = { \\rm l[oii]_{obs}}\\left(\\frac{\\rm ( h\\alpha / h\\beta)_{obs}}{b}\\right)^{4.89_{-0.29}^{+0.36}}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the unattenuated ratio as discussed above and errors are propagated from the errors on the best - fit @xmath25 . while for hiigalaxies and strong seyferts the choice of @xmath90 is clear , for composite galaxies the unknown @xmath90 may cause small systematic uncertainties .",
    "however as hii  regions have relatively stronger @xmath0emission , a value of @xmath91 is probably close to reality .    to derive a star formation rate from optical nebular emission lines ,",
    "two steps are required .",
    "this paper has focused on the first step : to correct the line for dust attenuation .",
    "the second step is to convert the dust - corrected line luminosity into a star formation rate .",
    "while our results show that dust - corrected @xmath0  luminosity traces [ ne ] luminosity , this is not enough to confirm the reliability of @xmath0  as an indicator of star formation rate in extremely dusty objects .",
    "this is because dense dust clouds can have high optical depths even in the mid - ir , as indicated by the strong silicate absorption in some galaxies , and thus even the neon lines may be attenuated in some objects . in addition ,",
    "the most extreme compact , dusty galaxies may even have a non - negligible fraction of their ionizing photons absorbed by dust and not gas ( and thus not traced by h@xmath30 ) .",
    "encouragingly , ho & keto ( 2007 ) have already shown how [ ne ] luminosity correlates strongly with both the total infrared luminosity and brackett-@xmath30 luminosity in star - forming galaxies .",
    "their galaxy sample includes a handful of ulirgs , showing that these relations hold even at extreme luminosities .",
    "this result provides circumstantial evidence that the neon luminosity is tracing star - formation even in the dustiest of galaxies .",
    "in contrast , farrah et al . ( 2007 ) find [ ne ] luminosity in ulirgs to be deficient by 0.4dex from the ho & keto relation , which they ascribe to extinction of the [ ne ] lines .",
    "in a companion paper we plan to address this issue directly by comparing the star formation rates derived from the full seds , with that derived from the emission lines .      as with star formation rate , the derivation of black hole accretion rates ( bhar ) from nebular emission line luminosities requires two steps : correction for dust emission discussed in this paper , and then conversion into bhar via a bolometric correction .    for the best - fit @xmath80 dust curve ,",
    "the relevant correction for dust attenuation at  is : @xmath92_{corr } } = { \\rm l[oiii]}\\left(\\frac{\\rm ( h\\alpha / h\\beta)_{obs}}{b}\\right)^{3.55_{-0.32}^{+0.40}}\\ ] ] where b is the unattenuated ratio as discussed above .",
    "the correction caused by the different dust curves is presented in the central panel of figure [ fig : atten ] .",
    "the exponent for the @xmath80 dust curve is larger than that used in some agn literature and can lead to significant differences in estimated bolometric agn luminosity and accretion rates as a fraction of @xmath93 ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "using a smaller exponent than appropriate will cause an underestimate in @xmath94 which will vary with dust content .",
    "for example , for the relatively dust - free sample of seyfert galaxies studied in this work , the difference between the @xmath80 dust curve exponent of 3.55 , and 2.94 ( from a mw extinction law ) used in e.g. @xcite and @xcite leads to differences ranging from 5 to 30% .",
    "the potential increase in the under- ( or over-)estimation of the line luminosity with increasing dust content because of an inappropriate dust - curve has important implications for understanding whether the bolometric correction for  changes systematically with , due to the correlations between sfr of the host galaxy and the luminosity of the central agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sfr and dust content of the host @xcite . our results do not explicitly constrain which dust - curve is most appropriate for seyferts , however , we would like to emphasise the importance of including the errors caused by the dust - attenuation correction when studying emission line trends .",
    "even in the two ulirgs in our sample where there is evidence for a heavily buried central nucleus , we would like to emphasise that the optical emission line ratios still indicate the possible presence of an agn , albeit not conclusively .",
    "this shows that even where the agn is deeply buried , some radiation may still escape to ionise the nlr clouds .",
    "this has important implications for using optical emission line ratios to identify agn in objects such as ulirgs , and will become increasingly important at high - z . unfortunately neither of the two ulirgs with strong silicate absorption in our sample have measured , and therefore we can not directly verify that their position on the bpt diagram , and therefore their correction of  for contamination from star formation , is correct .",
    "the specific study of a larger sample of ulirgs to compare the bolometric agn luminosities derived from mid - ir lines , mid - ir continuum and dust- and star - formation corrected high - quality optical emission lines would now be possible with samples in the sdss and spitzer archives .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to verify , or otherwise , the accuracy of fundamental quantities derived from optical emission lines , particularly in the case of significant dust attenuation of the lines . in particular , optical emission lines provide powerful measures of star formation rate and black hole accretion rate .",
    "we compared two `` dusty '' galaxy samples , including 6 ulirgs , to a sample of `` ordinary '' galaxies from the ssgss all with high quality sdss optical spectra and mid - ir spectra from the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "irs spectrograph .",
    "the results are extremely encouraging for using rest - frame optical spectra to study dusty galaxies with an @xmath95 .",
    "our results are promising even for galaxies as dusty as ulirgs , although a much larger sample should be studied covering the full range of this diverse population , in order to verify our conclusions .",
    "our results have important implications for future high - redshift spectroscopic surveys , where galaxies have higher star formation rates and dust contents may be correspondingly higher .",
    "we have compared several different dust curves used in the literature to correct optical emission lines for dust attenuation .",
    "our results favour a dust curve which lies close to the mw extinction curve , indicating that a significant fraction of the dust which attenuates nebular emission lines has a screen - like geometry .",
    "this is in agreement with the model for emission line attenuation presented by @xcite and @xcite and based upon the 2-component cf00 dust model . in this model ,",
    "the screen - like extinction arises from the dense stellar birth clouds which surround the hottest stars responsible for ionising the gas .",
    "we find a best - fit dust - curve with on average 40% of the optical depth at 5500  arising from diffuse ism dust .",
    "the @xmath80 dust curve is not significantly different from the calzetti dust - curve in the optical wavelength regime , however , we focus our results and analysis on the former which was intended for emission lines and allows greater flexibility , rather than the latter which was derived from galaxy continua .",
    "particular conclusions with regard to measuring star formation from optical emission lines in the presence of dust :    * the mw , calzetti , @xmath26 and best - fit @xmath80 dust curves all allow accurate correction of @xmath0  ( to better than a factor of 2 ) , and therefore accurate calculation of star formation rates , for galaxies with observed @xmath0/@xmath5  ratios of as much as 10 ( @xmath96 ) . * for only 2/6 ulirgs with @xmath97",
    "does the optical @xmath0  differ from the mid - ir [ ne ] lines by more than a factor of 2 , but then only by a factor of 4 .",
    "in these two cases ( 08572 and 15250 ) we have argued that the observed excess of [ ne ] is in fact caused by a buried agn , rather than uncertainties in the dust correction ( in agreement with the results of * ? ? ?",
    "* the majority of galaxies in our samples favour a dust curve close to the mw screen - like dust extinction curve .",
    "this suggests that much of the extra dust in the unusually dusty objects is located in dense clouds , rather than in the diffuse ism .",
    "* there is tentative evidence for a range in the shape of the dust curves in ordinary starforming galaxies . for the cf00 dust model ,",
    "this range translates into a variation in the fraction of optical depth arising in the diffuse ism of between around 30% and 90% , with the remaining fraction arising in dense birth clouds .",
    "however , the variation in the intrinsic [ ne]/@xmath0  ratio with metallicity , the issue of relative aperture correction between the irs and sdss data , and the large statistical errors on the @xmath5  emission line , prevent us from quantifying this scatter more precisely .",
    "particular conclusions with regard to identifying agn and measuring their accretion rates from optical emission lines in the presence of dust :    * the best - fit @xmath80 dust curve and measured balmer decrement allows accurate correction of  for dust attenuation , to within a factor of 3 .",
    "this is slightly surprising , and suggests that the effects of variations in the relative geometry of the source and dust , and differential extinction between the balmer and higher ionisation lines , are minimal . *",
    "the method to separate the contributions to optical emission lines from both star formation and agn presented in @xcite tightens the relation between  and  for composite objects .",
    "this supports the use of the position of galaxies on the optical bpt line ratio diagram to measure the amount of  originating from the agn , and therefore the estimates of black hole accretion rates from  corrected for dust attenuation and star formation contamination . *",
    "all ulirgs in our sample are classified as agn or composite objects from their optical emission line ratios .",
    "while the composite line ratios may be caused by shocks , we have argued that other observational results favour the presence of a buried agn contributing significantly to the mid - ir continuum .",
    "it is therefore possible that sufficient ionising flux escapes from the central source to ionise the nlr , even in the case of heavily buried nuclei such as in ulirgs 08572 and 15250 .",
    "unfortunately these two ulirgs do not have measured  preventing us from verifying our corrections to  for dust attenuation and star formation contamination in such extreme cases . in the case of ulirgs ,",
    "whose properties vary widely , clearly a much larger sample should be studied before firm conclusions can be drawn .",
