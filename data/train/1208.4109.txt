    "in the supplementary material , we discuss the anyonic properties of the synthetic dislocations constructed in this work , including their quantum dimensions and braiding rules . because these properties are not sensitive to the microscopic details , they can be studied in the continuous space using the loop algebra approach developed by barkeshli , jian and qi @xcite , which can be considered as a long - wave - length effective theory of synthetic dislocations .",
    "the essential idea of loop algebra is to use non - contractable wilson loops ( closed strings of operators ) to keep tract of the dislocation configurations in the system and specify the ground state hilbert space , such that the effect of adding , removing or braiding the dislocations can all be handled by the algebraic relations among these wilson loop operators .",
    "if we have several pairs of synthetic dislocations , we may arrange them along a line and choose the non - contractable loops like those in fig.[fig : wilson loops ] . adding each pair of dislocations into the system will introduce two additional loops : one going around the pair , and the other connects to the last pair of dislocations .",
    "all the wilson loop operators commute with the hamiltonian by definition , so the ground state hilbert space is simply a representation space ( presumably irreducible ) of the loop algebra . the new loops introduced by new dislocations",
    "will enlarge the representation space , and hence increase the ground state degeneracy .",
    "as has been pointed out in ref.@xcite , braiding two dislocations leads to the deformation of the wilson loops , so the ground states specified by these loops are also altered , resulting in a non - abelian berry phase that gives rise to the projective non - abelian statistics of dislocations .",

    "<S> therefore strong enough @xmath74 term can completely quench the degrees of freedom of both rotors , by polarizing the link to @xmath73 state . thus if the link operators @xmath75 are introduced to the the @xmath3 plaquette model along a chain of links as in fig.[fig : boson chain ] , i.e. @xmath76 , two rows of sites ( in region @xmath25 ) will be effectively removed in the large @xmath29 limit , producing synthetic dislocations that are expected to be related to the charge conjugate automorphism according to the anyon condensation picture .    to explicitly verify the above statement , we resort to the 2nd order perturbation as shown in fig.[fig : zz perturbation ] , and obtain the low energy effective hamiltonian @xmath53 , with the triple - plaquette operators given by @xmath77{fig_zzol.pdf}}}}=u_1 v_2 u_3 v_4,\\\\ o_{q\\in\\partial\\mathcal{c}}&={\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height=32pt]{fig_zzoe.pdf}}}}=u_1 v_2 u_3 v_4 u_5^\\dagger v_6^\\dagger , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and arranged as in fig.[fig : zz rings ] . because the link operator @xmath75 is made up of counter - oriented strings as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> , so any link that has been excited by a plaquette operator @xmath8 ( as depicted in fig.[fig : zz perturbation ] ) can only decay ( non - trivially ) through the action of a counter - oriented plaquette operator @xmath78 across the link . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the convective triple - plaquette operators in eq . , which glue the opposite strings together ( as exemplified by @xmath43=0 $ ] in fig.[fig : zz rings ] ) , realizing the charge conjugate automorphism </S>",
    "<S> . therefore dislocations ( twisted defects ) associated to the charge conjugate automorphism can be synthesized by a chain of link operators @xmath75 .    for the @xmath3 plaquette model with even integer @xmath79 , there is an additional subtlety that the effective hamiltonian also includes the term @xmath80 at both ends of the chain . </S>",

    "<S> however this even - odd effect should not matter in the large @xmath79 limit , as the coefficient @xmath86 gets exponentially weak .    simply by counting the constrains </S>",
    "<S> , it is not hard to show that add each pair of such dislocations will increase the topologically protected ground state degeneracy by @xmath87 for even @xmath79 and by @xmath69 for odd @xmath79 . </S>",

    "<S> the rotor hilbert space dimension is reduced by @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile in the @xmath25 region , the original @xmath93 single - plaquette operators become @xmath94 triple - plaquette operators . as the ground state @xmath95 is given by the constraints @xmath96 , each restricts the hilbert space dimension by a factor of @xmath97 . under strong @xmath29 coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the number of constraints is reduced by @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation of constraints is faster than the reduction of rotor degrees of freedom , leading to an increase of the ground state degeneracy by @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> so each dislocation is associated with the additional ground state degeneracy of @xmath79 , hence the quantum dimension @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> however for even integer @xmath79 , we still have the @xmath83 operator around each dislocation . because @xmath83 has two eigenvalues @xmath100 , it will further reduce the degeneracy by 2 , resulting in the @xmath88 quantum dimension for even integer @xmath79 . despite of the integer quantum dimension , the charge conjugate dislocations are also non - abelian anyons.@xcite    _ conclusion_ in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed the microscopic construction of flexible and movable synthetic dislocations by simply modifying the hamiltonian along a line of sites or links . </S>",
    "<S> two kinds of synthetic dislocations in the @xmath3 plaquette model were explicitly constructed : one associated to the @xmath15-@xmath16 duality , and the other associated to the charge conjugation . </S>",
    "<S> both are automorphisms among the intrinsic anyons related by statistical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic way to design synthetic dislocations is to condense the intrinsic anyon excitations that is left over by the automorphism along the branch - cut line . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15-@xmath16 duality ( charge conjugate ) dislocations can be synthesized by condensing a chain of @xmath6 anyon ( paired charges ) . in principle , even more general dislocations can be synthesized by arbitrary anyon condensation . the synthetic dislocations are associated to additional topological degeneracy , and rendered as projective non - abelian anyons . therefore anyon condensation provides us a controllable and systematic way to generate the topologically protected ground state degeneracy in a topologically ordered system .    </S>",
