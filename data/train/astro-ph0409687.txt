    "powerful - radio - jet activity is regarded as a useful tracer of large - scale structure in the distant universe ( e.g.  miley et al .",
    "2004 ) , but with the exception of a few studies ( e.g.  gopal - krishna & wiita 2001 ; rawlings 2003 ) , its influence on galaxy formation is typically ignored .",
    "this is because , even in the young universe where supermassive black holes have high accretion rates and are visible as quasars , only a few per cent of accreting black holes develop powerful radio jets ( e.g.  goldschmidt et al .",
    "it is now accepted , however , that quasars do play a key rle in galaxy formation because of the existence of remarkably tight correlations between the masses of black holes and the properties of their associated dark - matter halos such as velocity dispersion ( e.g.  ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "such correlations are most easily understood in terms of ` feedback models ' ( silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ) in which the mechanical power emerging from radio - quiet accreting black holes injects energy into the gaseous component of the young galaxy over and above that which it has acquired by gravitational collapse . in sec .",
    "[ sec : feedback ] we adopt a feedback model for radio - loud accreting black holes and in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] we use this model , together with hierarchical clustering theory , to compare the predicted cosmic evolution in the comoving space density of radio sources with the evolution observed .",
    "we reach some new conclusions concerning the cosmological importance of radio sources in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the convention for spectral index @xmath3 is that flux density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the observing frequency , and the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) , the comoving space density of sources per ( base 10 ) logarithmic interval of 1.4-ghz radio luminosity @xmath6 , is assumed proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "we assume throughout a low - density , @xmath8-dominated universe in which @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "here , we adopt a form of feedback model in which powerful ( radio - loud quasar ) jets deliver some fraction @xmath15 of their mechanical power @xmath16 to ionized gas which , prior to the powerful - jet episode , is bound to a number @xmath17 of dark - matter - dominated halos ( one hosting the radio - jet - producing central engine , the others in the surrounding protocluster ) , each of mass @xmath18 and velocity dispersion @xmath19 .",
    "we assume this injection of energy occurs over a timescale @xmath20 , and that the energy is deposited as thermal energy in the gas ( with negligible radiative losses ; see rawlings 2003 ) , and that each halo has just virialized at redshift @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 ( somerville & primack 1999 ) .",
    "we consider the critical point at which sufficient mechanical energy is delivered to the gas so that it just becomes unbound from each of the @xmath17 surrounding halos .",
    "this yields a scaling relation    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the fraction of the total ( dark - matter - dominated ) mass in gas , and @xmath25 is a constant of order unity .",
    "the choices of normalizing constants for each variable will be explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] .",
    "it is clear from equation  1 that powerful - jet activity can remove gas not only from a single host galaxy , but also from a large number ( @xmath26 ) of surrounding galaxy - sized dark - matter halos . in the local universe ,",
    "powerful - jet activity is confined to black holes triggered in rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g.  cygnus a and 3c  295 ) , and although x - ray observations provide ample evidence of ionized gas being pushed back and heated by such radio sources ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , the cluster potential wells are sufficiently deep ( @xmath27 ) that the gas remains in a gravitationally - bound intracluster medium",
    ". this will not be true in similar systems at much earlier times because hierarchical structure formation ( e.g.  press & schechter 1974 ; percival , miller & peacock 2000 ) demands that , in the young universe , the clusters of galaxies seen today were gravitationally - unbound protoclusters , collections of protogalaxies lacking any deep extended potential well , and hence any intracluster medium .",
    "the hierarchical clustering of dark - matter halos and the background cosmology ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) are now so well understood that it is possible to use the feedback model of sec .",
    "[ sec : feedback ] to make a firm prediction for the number of powerful - jet episodes triggered per comoving volume per unit cosmic time , modulo just one key uncertainty , the fraction of newly - created halos that give rise to powerful - jet activity .",
    "powerful - jet activity in the local universe gives vital clues to the critical features of the halos : such jets emerge only from massive elliptical galaxies , with a relatively narrow spread in black hole mass @xmath28 , corresponding to halo velocity dispersions @xmath29 ( mclure et al .",
    "we introduce a factor @xmath30 to allow for the fact that a halo within this range of @xmath19 is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for powerful - jet activity .",
    "some choices of normalizing constants in equation  [ eq : one ] follow from the assumed close mapping between black hole and dark - matter properties : @xmath31 corresponds to the most powerful jets observed ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) , and is the eddington luminosity of an @xmath32 black hole ; and @xmath33 is the mass of a dark - matter halo with @xmath34 , collapsing at @xmath35 ( somerville & primack 1999 ) .",
    "other choices were motivated as follows : theory demands @xmath36 ( e.g.  bicknell et al .",
    "1997 ) ; @xmath37 corresponds to the ratio of baryons to dark matter , assuming that baryons in forms other than hot gas can be neglected ; and @xmath38 is ( for an assumed quasar accretion efficiency @xmath39 ) the mass - doubling timescale for eddington - limited growth of a black hole , consistent with lower - limits on radio source lifetimes derived from the observed linear sizes of powerful radio galaxies ( e.g.  kaiser , dennett - thorpe & alexander 1997 ; blundell & rawlings 1999 ) .",
    "powerful jets are liable only to be triggered when two supermassive black holes coalesce ( wilson & colbert 1995 ) , and since this can only happen as the result of a major merger ( a special class of ` halo creation event ' ) , we have used hierarchical structure formation theory ( percival et al .",
    "2000 ) to predict how the trigger rate of powerful jets depends on cosmic epoch ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that episodes of powerful - jet activity are predicted to occur over a wide range of cosmic epochs , persisting at some level throughout the later stages of the ` epoch of reionization ' during which a partially ionized universe at @xmath40 ( spergel et al .  2003 ) becomes fully ionized by @xmath41 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "( 150,120 ) ( -30,-20 )    predicting the radio emission from powerful - jet episodes is , in general , an extremely complicated function of properties like the time after the jet - triggering event and the gaseous environment , as well as observational choices like frequency .",
    "we therefore focus on episodes whose observational manifestation will be flat - spectrum ( @xmath42 ) radio emission which arises when the jets happen to be favourably oriented , i.e.  within a ` beaming angle ' covering a sky fraction @xmath43 ( see jarvis & rawlings 2000 ) . such `",
    "doppler - boosted ' emission arises from synchrotron - self - absorbed knots at the base of the jet , and the ratio of its luminosity to @xmath16 should be fairly constant throughout the lifetime @xmath20 of the radio source ( and relatively insensitive to environment and redshift effects ) whereas , in contrast , contributions to @xmath6 from extended structures will , owing to inverse - compton cooling and other effects ( e.g.  kaiser et al .",
    "1997 ; blundell , rawlings & willott 1999 ) , typically be a strong function of time since the jets were triggered , environment and redshift .",
    "we use the creation rate @xmath44 for @xmath34 halos ( from fig .  1 ) to estimate , following efstathiou & rees ( 1988 ) , the comoving space density @xmath45 of triggered flat - spectrum sources using    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a constant of order unity ( incorporating an assumption that there is @xmath48 triggering event per halo as it evolves through an @xmath48-dex spread in @xmath18 ) , and @xmath49 ( explained fully in the caption to fig .",
    "2 ) ensures that @xmath45 is integrated over only the top dex of the flat - spectrum rlf .",
    "this is the regime ( fig .",
    "2 ) in which the high - redshift space density of flat - spectrum quasars is observationally constrained ( jarvis & rawlings 2000 ) .",
    "( 150,120 ) ( -30,-20 )    the crucial unknown quantity in equation  2 is @xmath30 .",
    "we have fixed this at the value ( @xmath50 ) delivered by requiring roughly equal normalizations for the predicted and measured values of @xmath45 in fig .",
    "2 . with this normalization fixed , and within the considerable current uncertainties , the observational constraints on @xmath45 are in good agreement with the gradual high - redshift decline predicted by hierarchical structure formation theories .",
    "however , the more interesting result is that we require @xmath50 , implying that only @xmath48 in 100 triggering events ( in the relevant halo velocity dispersion range ) generate powerful - jet episodes .",
    "the feedback model of equation  1 implies that each powerful - jet episode influences , in the young universe , @xmath51 halos . by considering the conditions before and after one of these episodes",
    ", we will argue in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] that the relationship    @xmath52    established here using physical arguments based around equations  1 & 2 and a measurement of the flat - spectrum quasar rlf , is telling us something important about the galaxy formation process .",
    "in the young universe , ` high - peak bias ' ( kaiser 1984 ) will have established the regions of space destined , by present epochs , to become clusters of galaxies .",
    "each of these protoclusters will contain @xmath53 protogalaxies which , from fig ,  1 , will form over a wide range of epochs and which , because of ` high - peak bias ' , will be strongly clustered .",
    "such protoclusters have been observed in the form of emission - line - emitting objects and ` lyman - break ' galaxies around high - redshift radio galaxies ( e.g.  miley et al .",
    "central black holes will form in all the high - velocity - dispersion ( @xmath54 , e.g.   ridgway et al .",
    "2001 ) halos , presumably with masses set by the feedback processes common in radio - quiet quasars ( silk & rees 1998 ) ; we see from fig .",
    "1 that these halos tend to be created at much earlier epochs than the higher - velocity - dispersion ones .",
    "eventually , hierarchical processes will cause one pair of halos , each containing a supermassive black hole , to merge , creating a single @xmath55 halo with a single coalesced black hole , and triggering a powerful - jet episode .",
    "this will be a much more dramatic type of feedback event because the radio source injects enough energy into its surroundings that it gravitationally unbinds ionized gas associated not only with the host galaxy , but more widely throughout the protocluster ( see also nath & roychowdhury 2002 , and refs . therein ) .",
    "there has been insufficient cosmic time for a larger dark - matter halo to form , so this process yields a reservoir of protocluster gas which is not yet gravitationally bound , and is now so hot that it can not accrete back onto the protogalaxies .",
    "there will then be a synchronized , protocluster - wide shut down of activity , be it circumnuclear star - formation or black - hole accretion .    for a protogalaxy @xmath56 from the radio galaxy , fresh supplies of neutral / molecular gas from accretion and cooling will be shut off after @xmath57 ( @xmath58times the light - travel time ; e.g.blundell & rawlings 1999 ) , and star - formation and agn activity will cease once the reserves of neutral gas have been exhausted ( taking @xmath59 if star - formation rates of @xmath60 use up neutral / molecular gas reservoirs of mass @xmath61 , e.g.  greve et al .",
    "accounting for these time lags , and the ` high - peak bias ' , it is not surprising that there seem to be significant overdensities of both intense starbursting systems ( stevens et al .",
    "2003 ) and x - ray - selected agn ( pentericci et al .",
    "2002 ) around high - redshift radio galaxies .",
    "there is also mounting evidence that the amount of gas and dust in the host galaxy of a powerful radio source decreases as the source expands from various anti - correlations between different tracers of this material and source sizes ( baker et al .",
    "2002 ; willott et al .  2002 ; jarvis et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we conclude that powerful - jet activity represents a dramatic ( factor @xmath1 ) step - function increase in the efficiency of feedback mechanisms believed to be an essential part of galaxy formation .",
    "its influence is , however , far more widespread as sufficient energy is delivered to the protocluster environment that gas can no longer cool onto the @xmath53 surrounding protogalaxies .",
    "star - formation and black hole activity throughout the protocluster is shut down , but , accounting both for time before the jet - triggering event ( see fig .  1 ) and time lags after the event",
    ", there was ample opportunity for @xmath0 of the protogalaxies to shine as radio - quiet quasars , and to build up their supermassive black holes and stellar bulges .",
    "in crude terms , this provides a natural explanation for the relative number of radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars at high redshift ( e.g.  goldschmidt et al .",
    "1999 ) . the observed space density of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fig .",
    "2 ) predicts that a powerful - jet episode occurs in @xmath48 in 100 protogalaxies , which is as expected if each protocluster experiences @xmath48 such event .",
