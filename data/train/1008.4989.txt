    "<S> some string resonance states of color singlet can obtain large mass shifts through the open string one - loop effect , or through the mixing with closed string states , and the shape of resonance structure can be distorted . </S>",
    "<S> although the distortion is not very large ( 10% for the mass squared ) , it might be able to observe the effect at the lhc , if gluon jets and quark jets could be distinguished in a certain level of efficiency .    </S>",
