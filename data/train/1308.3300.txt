    "recent development of digital technology enables us to make digital signal processing ( dsp ) systems much more robust , flexible , and cheaper than analog systems . owing to the recent digital technology ,",
    "advanced adaptive algorithms with fast dsp devices are used in _ active noise control _ ( anc ) systems  @xcite ; air conditioning ducts  @xcite , noise canceling headphones  @xcite , and automotive applications  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "[ fig : anc ] shows a standard active noise control system . in this system , @xmath1 represents continuous - time noise which we want to eliminate during it goes through the duct .",
    "precisely , we aim at diminishing the noise at the point c. for this purpose , we set a loudspeaker near the point c which emits anti - phase sound signals to cancel the noise .",
    "since the noise is unknown in many cases , it is almost impossible to determine anti - phase signals _ a priori_. hence , we set a microphone at the point a to measure the continuous - time noise , and adopt a digital filter @xmath2 with ad ( analog - to - digital ) and da ( digital - to - analog ) devices .",
    "namely , the continuous - time signal @xmath1 is discretized to produce a discrete - time signal @xmath3 , which is processed by the digital filter @xmath2 to produce another discrete - time signal @xmath4 .",
    "then a da converter and a loudspeaker at the point b are used to emit anti - phase signals to cancel the noise in the duct .        in active noise control ,",
    "it is important to compensate the distortion by the transfer characteristic of the secondary path ( from b to c ) . to compensate this ,",
    "a standard adaptive algorithm uses a filtered signal of the noise @xmath0 , and is called _ filtered - x algorithm _  @xcite .",
    "this filter is usually chosen by a discrete - time model of the secondary path  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the adaptive filter @xmath2 optimizes the norm ( or the variance in the stochastic setup ) of the discretized signal @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sampling period of ad and da device .",
    "this is proper if the secondary path is also a discrete - time system .",
    "however , in reality , the path is a _ continuous - time _ system , and hence the optimization should be executed taking account of the behavior of the continuous - time error signal @xmath8 .",
    "such an optimization may seem to be difficult because the system is a _ hybrid _ system containing both continuous- and discrete - time signals .",
    "recently , several articles have been devoted to the design considering a continuous - time behavior . in  @xcite ,",
    "a hybrid controller containing an analog filter and a digital adaptive filter has been proposed .",
    "owing to the analog filter , a robust performance is attained against the variance of the secondary path . however , an analog filter is often unwelcome because of its poor reliability or maintenance cost .",
    "another approach has been proposed in  @xcite . in this paper , they assume that the noise @xmath1 is a linear combination of a finite number of sinusoidal waves",
    ". then the adaptive algorithm is executed in the frequency domain based on the frequency response of the continuous - time secondary path .",
    "this method is very effective if we _ a priori _ know the frequencies of the noise .",
    "however , unknown signal with other frequencies can not be eliminated .",
    "if we prepare adaptive filters considering many frequencies to avoid such a situation , the complexity of the controller will be very high .",
    "the same situation has been considered in control systems theory . the modern _ sampled - data control theory _  @xcite has been developed in 90 s  @xcite , which gives an exact design / analysis method for hybrid systems containing continuous - time plants and discrete - time controllers .",
    "the key idea is _",
    "lifting_. lifting is a transformation of continuous - time signals to an infinite - dimensional ( i.e. , function - valued ) discrete - time signals .",
    "the operation can be interpreted as a _ continuous - time polyphase decomposition_. in multirate signal processing , the ( discrete - time ) polyphase decomposition enables the designer to perform all computations at the lowest rate  @xcite . in the same way , by lifting , continuous - time signals or systems can be represented in the discrete - time domain with no errors .    the lifting approach is recently applied to digital signal processing  @xcite , and proved to provide an effective method for digital filter design .",
    "motivated these works , this article focuses on a new scheme of filtered-@xmath0 adaptive algorithm which takes account of the continuous - time behavior . more precisely , we define the problem of active noise control as design of the digital filter which minimizes a continuous - time cost function . by using the lifting technique",
    ", we derive the wiener solution for this problem , and a steepest descent algorithm based on the wiener solution .",
    "then we propose an lms ( least mean square ) type algorithm to obtain a causal system .",
    "the lms algorithm involves an integral computation on a finite interval , and we adopt an approximation based on lifting representation .",
    "the approximated algorithm can be easily executed by a ( linear , time - invariant , and finite dimensional ) digital filter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : fxlms ] formulates the problem of active noise control . section [ sec : sd ] gives the wiener solution , the steepest descent algorithm , and the lms - type algorithm with convergence theorems .",
    "section [ sec : approximation ] proposes an approximation method for computing an integral of signals for the lms - type algorithm .",
