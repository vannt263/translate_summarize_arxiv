    "recent years have witnessed the emergence of the idea of an accelerating universe and due to some observational results @xcite , it is now established that the universe is accelerating .",
    "this signifies a paradigm shift in cosmological research from _ expanding universe _ to _ accelerated expanding universe_. now , the problem lies in detecting an exotic type of unknown repulsive force , termed as dark energy , which is driving this acceleration .",
    "a key factor in dark energy investigation is the equation of state parameter @xmath3 , which relates pressure and density through an equation of state of the form @xmath4 . due to lack of observational evidence in making a distinction between constant and variable @xmath3 , usually the equation of state parameter",
    "is considered as a constant @xcite with phase wise values @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for dust , radiation , vacuum fluid and stiff fluid dominated universe respectively .",
    "but in general , @xmath3 is a function of time or redshift @xcite .",
    "for instance , quintessence models involving scalar fields give rise to time - dependent @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "there is literature available on models with varying fields , such as cosmological model with a time dependent equation of state in a kaluza - klein metric , cosmological model with a viscous fluid in a kaluza klein metric and wormholes with varying equation of state parameter@xcite .",
    "so , there are enough grounds for considering @xmath3 as time - dependent for a better understanding of the cosmic evolution .",
    "now , various types of physical models including phenomenological ones ( with time - dependent @xmath0 ) are contemplated for unveiling the nature of dark energy .",
    "it may be mentioned here that phenomenological time - varying @xmath0 models were proposed initially even before the emergence of the idea of cosmic acceleration for solving the well known cosmological constant problem @xcite . at present , various kinematical @xmath0 models of phenomenological character are proposed for explaining the present acceleration . in a recent work , ray et al . @xcite",
    "have shown the equivalence of three phenomenological @xmath0 models , viz .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 in four dimensional space - time for constant @xmath3 while the same three models of @xmath0 were shown to be equivalent in five dimensional kaluza - klein type model by pradhan et al.@xcite treating @xmath3 as a constant quantity .",
    "so , it is quite natural to investigate the behaviour of the above three models when the equation of state parameter is a function of time .",
    "in fact , mukhopadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite have already made an attempt in this direction by investigating two other dynamical @xmath0 models , viz . @xmath11 and @xmath12 with variable equation of state parameter .    in the present work , an investigation of the models @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 are made under the _ ansatz _ @xmath13 both in four and five dimensional space - time . for a flat universe ,",
    "these two models are shown to be equivalent for variable @xmath3 both in four and five dimensions .",
    "some other features , revealed by letting @xmath3 be a function of time , have also been observed .",
    "the einstein field equations are given by @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cosmological term @xmath0 is time - dependent , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the velocity of light in vacuum , is assumed to be unity .",
    "let us consider the robertson - walker metric @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , the curvature constant , assumes the values @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 for open , flat and closed models of the universe respectively and @xmath19 is the scale factor .",
    "for a flat universe ( @xmath20 ) and the spherically symmetric metric ( 2 ) , field equations  ( 1 ) yield friedmann and raychaudhuri equations respectively , given by @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the cosmic matter - energy density and pressure respectively and the hubble parameter @xmath25 is related to the scale factor by @xmath26 .",
    "let us now choose the barotropic equation of state @xmath27 here we assume that the equation of state parameter @xmath3 is time - dependent i.e. @xmath13 such that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant having dimension of time .    from equation ( 3 ) , for flat universe",
    ", we get @xmath30 using equation ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in ( 4 ) one can get , after some manipulation , the following differential equation @xmath31      let us use the _ ansatz _ @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is a free parameter ) along with @xmath34 . then equation ( 7 ) reduces to @xmath35 solving equation ( 8) , we get @xmath36 writing @xmath26 in equation ( 9 ) and integrating it further we get our solution set as @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an integration constant .",
    "it is interesting to note that putting @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath42 ) and * @xmath43 * in equations ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we can recover the same expressions for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively as those obtained by ray et al . @xcite .",
    "but , equation ( 10 ) indicates that @xmath47 can not be equal to zero .",
    "moreover , the expression for @xmath48 in equation ( 10 ) differs from that of ray et al .",
    "so , in general , the constant @xmath3 of ray et al .",
    "@xcite and time - varying @xmath3 of this case present us with different situations .    by using equations ( 6 ) and ( 9 )",
    ", we get @xcite @xmath49 where , in absence of any curvature , matter density @xmath50 and dark energy density @xmath51 are related by the equation @xmath52      using the _ ansatz _ @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is a parameter ) in equation ( 7 ) we get the differential equation @xmath55 solving equation ( 15 ) , we get @xmath56 again , solving equation ( 16 ) we get our solution set as @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an integration constant . in this case also , for @xmath41 and @xmath43 we get back the same expressions for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as those obtained by ray et al .  @xcite . but here again @xmath41 is forbidden via equation ( 17 ) . thus for the @xmath61 case also , variable @xmath3 and constant @xmath3 present us with different situations .",
    "kaluza - klein type robertson - walker metric is given by @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the metric ( 20 ) , the field equations ( 1 ) yield the following two differential equations @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 .    from ( 21 )",
    ", for flat universe ( @xmath20 ) , we can write @xmath66 using equations ( 5 ) and ( 23 ) , for @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath67      let us substitute @xmath68 in equation ( 24 ) , where @xmath29 has the same significance as before . then from equation ( 24 ) , after use of the _ ansatz _ @xmath32 , we get @xmath69 solving equation ( 26 ) , we have @xmath70 again , writing @xmath26 in equation ( 26 ) and solving the resulting differential equation we get our solution set as @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an integration constant .    equation ( 27 ) shows that for physical validity @xmath75 .",
    "also , from equation ( 26 ) we find that @xmath76 if @xmath29 is positive .",
    "but , equation ( 29 ) tells us that for a repulsive @xmath0 , @xmath77 . so combining these two cases we can write @xmath78 .      using the _ ansatz _ @xmath79 , equation ( 24 ) reduces to @xmath80 solving equation ( 30 ) , we get @xmath81 writing @xmath26 in equation ( 31 ) and solving the resulting differential equation",
    ", we get our solution set as @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an integration constant .    equation ( 32 ) shows that , for physical validity @xmath75 . again , by equation ( 31 ) , @xmath86 for a positive @xmath29 , whereas equation ( 34 ) tells us that for repulsive @xmath0 either @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "so , a positive @xmath54 will make all the equations ( 31 ) , ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) physically valid .",
    "using equations ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) it is easy to obtain @xcite @xmath49    where , in the absence of any curvature , matter - energy density @xmath50 ( @xmath89 ) and dark energy density @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) are related by the equation @xmath52 similarly , using equation ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) , we find that @xmath54 is related to @xmath50 and @xmath51 through the relation @xmath92 now , by the use of equations ( 35 ) and ( 37 ) we find that equations ( 10 ) and ( 17 ) differ by a constant while the equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) become identical to equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) .",
    "this means that , @xmath93 and @xmath61 models are equivalent .      coming to the five dimensional kaluza - klein model , we find that with the help of equations ( 23 ) and ( 26 ) , one can easily obtain @xmath94 for @xmath93 model .",
    "it is to note that equation ( 36 ) still holds in the 5d case .",
    "similarly , using equations ( 31 ) and ( 33 ) , we get @xmath95 for @xmath61 model .    with the help of equations ( 38 ) and ( 39 )",
    "it is easy to show that the equations ( 27 ) and ( 32 ) differ by a constant while equations ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) become identical to the equations ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath93 and @xmath61 models are equivalent for five dimensional space - time also .",
    "apart from being a mere mathematical parameter , @xmath29 bears some deeper physical significance also . in some works",
    "@xcite it has been shown that @xmath29 represents the time - scale of evaporation of bose - einstein condensates which include a time - dependent @xmath0 . in the present work , @xmath29",
    "is linked with the equation of state parameter @xmath3 and cosmic time @xmath96 .",
    "the exact nature of @xmath3 and @xmath96 dependence of @xmath29 may be explored elsewhere after @xmath47 is specified properly .",
    "although in the present work the equation of state parameter @xmath3 is taken as time - dependent , it can be a function of the red - shift @xmath97 or scale factor @xmath98 as well .",
    "the red - shift dependence of @xmath3 can be linear like @xmath99 with @xmath100  @xcite or non - linear as @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "now , in the present work , the structure of @xmath3 suggests that it is of the form @xmath102 which can be regarded as a generalization of the special form @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "now , @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath104 since @xmath29 has dimensions of time , it can not be negative .",
    "this implies that @xmath105 for integral values of @xmath47 .",
    "sn ia data suggest that @xmath106 @xcite while the limit imposed on @xmath3 by a combination of sn ia data ( with cmb anisotropy ) and galaxy clustering statistics @xcite is @xmath107 .",
    "so , if the present work is compared with the above - mentioned experimental results then , one can conclude that the limit of @xmath3 provided by the equation ( 40 ) may be accommodated within the acceptable range ( figs 1 and 2 ) .",
    "also it is clear that for the present dust - filled universe ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath29 is equal to @xmath96 whereas for vacuum fluid @xmath29 becomes meaningless .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath108 is a very important factor for understanding cosmic evolution .",
    "particularly , after the emergence of the idea of an accelerating universe , the role of this parameter has become even more important .",
    "this is because some recent works @xcite have demonstrated that the present acceleration is a phenomenon of the recent past and was preceded by a decelerating phase .",
    "this cosmological picture supports the presently favored @xmath0-cdm universe .",
    "so , during cosmic evolution the deceleration parameter @xmath108 must have undergone a change of sign from a positive to a negative value .",
    "so , calculation of @xmath108 from our model is essential for detecting a possible signature flip of @xmath108 .",
    "now , using equations ( 9 ) and ( 35 ) we can obtain @xmath109 = -[1 - 1.5\\omega_m ( t/\\tau)^n].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( 42 ) shows that in the four dimensional case the expression for @xmath108 contains a time factor and hence with a suitable choice of @xmath47 , @xmath108 can show its change of sign ( figs 3 and 4 ) .",
    "similarly , in the five dimensional case , using equations ( 26 ) and ( 38 ) the expression for @xmath108 reduces to @xmath110.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( 42 ) shows that @xmath108 is time - dependent for the five dimensional case also and hence may change its sign during cosmic evolution ( figs 5 and 6 ) .",
    "so , for @xmath93 model , @xmath108 shows the possibility of a change of sign in both four and five dimensions .",
    "since @xmath93 and @xmath61 models are equivalent , it is clear that @xmath61 model will also show change of sign of @xmath108 .",
    "again , @xmath108 can be written in terms of @xmath3 as @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the four dimensional case and @xmath112,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the five dimensional case .",
    "now , considering various experimental and theoretical results , one can safely assume that the present value of the cosmic matter - energy density ( @xmath113)as @xmath114 @xcite ( though seems rather a bit high value as given wmap5 results ) .",
    "so , for the present dust - filled universe ( @xmath42 ) , in the four dimensional case the value of @xmath108 comes out as @xmath115 which is in nice agreement with the present accepted range of @xmath108 for an accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "for the five dimensional case , @xmath116 for the same set of values of @xmath113 and @xmath117 and hence that also supports the idea of an accelerating universe .",
    "although some specific constant values for the equation of state parameter @xmath3 are used for different phases of the cosmic evolution , that technique suffers from some kind of discreteness problem .",
    "the transition from one cosmic era to another can be understood better with a variable @xmath3 .",
    "so , in order to have a continuous picture of cosmic evolution , @xmath3 should be regarded as time - dependent . in the previous sections , by selecting a simple power law expression of @xmath96 for the equation of state parameter @xmath3 , equivalence of the models @xmath118 and @xmath61 has been established in both four and five dimensions . in the four dimensional case ,",
    "the parameters of the two equivalent models bear the same relationship with cosmic matter and vacuum energy densities as was found by ray et al .",
    "@xcite for constant @xmath3 .",
    "but in five dimensions , the relationship of the same two parameters with @xmath50 and @xmath51 differ from that of pradhan et al .",
    "it has also been possible to show that the sought - for signature flipping of the deceleration parameter @xmath108 can be obtained by suitable choice of @xmath47 in both four and five dimensions .",
    "this feature of the work satisfies an important criterion of @xmath0-cdm cosmology .",
    "it should be mentioned that the model @xmath119 which was shown to be equivalent to the present two @xmath0 models by ray et al .",
    "@xcite ( in four dimensions ) as well as by pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite ( in five dimension ) is found not to be equivalent to the two models considered here when @xmath3 is time - dependent .    if we now look at the plots , our observations regarding these are as follows : + ( 1 ) the plots ( figs 1 and 2 ) for @xmath3 show that in the early stage , it was positive i.e. in the early stages , the universe was matter - dominated .",
    "the plots for @xmath108 also support this ( i.e. decelerating phase of the universe ) . at late times",
    "it is evolving with negative values ( i.e. at the present time ) .",
    "the earlier real matter later on converted to the dark energy - dominated phase of the universe .",
    "it , finally , ends up at @xmath120 , representing a cosmological constant dominated universe ; + ( 2 ) the plots ( figs 3 - 6 ) for @xmath108 show that in the early stages the universe was in a decelerating phase and at late times , it is in an accelerating one .",
    "finally , the models under consideration are shown to be equivalent in both four and five dimensions and extension to the fifth dimension do not present us any basically new physical feature than the four dimensional case .",
    "so , a natural question can be raised : is there any justification for extension to five dimensions under the framework of general relativity ? in this connection",
    "we would like to mention the works of kapner et al .",
    "@xcite and rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite where it is shown that extension of four dimensional general relativity to higher dimensions becomes mostly ineffective .",
    "one of the authors ( sr ) is thankful to the authority of inter - university centre for astronomy and astrophysics , pune , india for providing visiting associateship programme under which a part of this work was carried out .",
