    "with the introduction of efficient multi - object spectrographs on 4m - class telescopes , it has become possible to construct large samples of faint galaxies with measured redshifts .",
    "with such a sample , one can compute the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies as a function of redshift and thereby directly observe the evolution ( or lack thereof ) of the galaxy population .",
    "several groups have now presented the results of deep , faint galaxy redshift surveys ( @xcite , cfrs ; @xcite , autofib ; @xcite ; @xcite , cnoc ) .",
    "the conclusions from these surveys are in broad agreement : the population of blue , star - forming galaxies has evolved strongly since @xmath16 while the population of red galaxies shows at most modest signs of evolution ( although , see kauffmann , charlot , & white ( 1996 ) for an alternative analysis of the red galaxies ) . however , there are important differences as well .",
    "lin et al . ( 1996a ) demonstrate that the lfs from the various groups are formally inconsistent with each other .",
    "since there are many selection effects involved with the construction and analysis of faint redshift surveys , it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons for the disagreement between the various groups .",
    "while it is likely that the small numbers of galaxies in each survey and the small areas covered are partly responsible , it is also likely that systematic errors are in important contributor to the differences in detail .",
    "quantitative estimates of the evolution are , of course , dependent upon having a reliable measurement of the local lf , and it is , therefore , of concern that there remain considerable uncertainties about the _",
    "local _ lf . the lfs derived from large - area local redshifts survey ( e.g. , the stromlo / apm survey , loveday et al . 1992 ; the cfa survey , marzke , huchra , & geller 1994a ; the las campanas redshift survey , lin et al .",
    "1996b ) all have similar shapes , but there are still substantial differences over the overall normalization , the characteristic luminosity , and the slope at low luminosities . the rapid evolution at @xmath17 required to match steep @xmath18-band counts at intermediate magnitudes @xmath19 ( maddox et al . 1990 ) could be reduced if the normalization or the faint - end slope have been underestimated .",
    "the results of the largest of the local surveys , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) with 18678 galaxies used in the lf analysis and a median redshift of @xmath20 , are seemingly consistent with both a low normalization and a flat faint - end slope .",
    "the lcrs is selected from ccd drift scans rather than photographic plates and surveys what should be a fair volume of the universe ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 , davis 1996 ) .",
    "it also probes both the southern and northern galactic caps .",
    "accordingly , the local luminosity function computed from their data should be free from systematic photometric errors and fluctuations in large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies .",
    "however , both the cfa survey and the autofib survey find a normalization which is a factor of 2 higher than that obtained from the lcrs .",
    "while the normalization of the cfa survey can be questioned on the grounds that it does not sample a fair volume , the autofib survey is the concatenation of many fields distributed across the sky .",
    "the autofib survey is particularly important because the galaxy sample was selected with a much fainter surface brightness threshold than any of the other local surveys .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1994 ) emphasizes that a large population of intrinsically luminous but low surface brightness galaxies may be missed in the shallow photometry on which all the local surveys , except autofib , are based .",
    "a steep faint - end slope of the lf , with a power law exponent of @xmath21 , is a natural prediction of galaxy formation theories based on hierarchical structure formation models ( kauffmann , guiderdoni , & white 1994 ) .",
    "there is only weak evidence for a steep faint - end slope in the local field galaxy lf .",
    "marzke et al .",
    "( 1994b ) report an upturn in the luminosity function of late - type galaxies with @xmath22 , but lcrs , autofib , and cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) all derive a flat faint - end slope .",
    "there is , however , evidence for a steep faint - end slope in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , de propris et al .",
    "1995 , bernstein et al .",
    "environmental influences on galaxy evolution may be reflected in variations of the lf for galaxies in different environments , and it is therefore important to measure the lf in a variety of environments .    in this paper , we investigate the evolution and environmental dependence of the galaxy lf based on data obtained during the course of our redshift survey of the corona borealis supercluster . the primary motivation for the survey was to study the dynamics of the supercluster .",
    "however , the majority of galaxies for which we measured redshifts actually lie behind the corona borealis supercluster , thus providing a sample suitable for study of the evolution of the lf .",
    "the galaxies were originally selected from plates taken as part of the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ; @xcite ) and have been calibrated in the gunn @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands , which correspond roughly to the photographic @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands .",
    "previous redshift surveys have generally been either selected in bluer bands ( @xmath18 ) , for sensitivity to changes in star - formation rates , or redder bands ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , for sensitivity to old stellar populations which more reliably trace stellar mass .",
    "although we had no option but to use the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands , the two bands turn out fortuitously to have the virtue that corrections to the rest @xmath18 band , where lfs are traditionally computed and compared , are small since the @xmath23 band matches the rest @xmath18 band at @xmath28 and the @xmath7 band matches the rest @xmath18 band at @xmath29 .",
    "the cnoc survey used photometry in @xmath23 and @xmath7 as well , and so it is particularly interesting to compare our results to that survey since there should be no systematic effects due to using different passbands for galaxy selection .",
    "finally , with over 400 redshifts in the corona borealis supercluster , and roughly 300 in a background supercluster , we can explore the variation of the lf from the field to the supercluster environment .",
    "the paper , the second in the series presenting results from the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster , is organized as follows . in  2 , we summarize our survey , particularly emphasizing those features that are directly relevant to the computation of the lf .",
    "we discuss the details of the computation of the lf in  3 .",
    "the results are given in  4 for both field galaxies and for the two superclusters individually and are discussed in  5 . finally , we summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "we use a hubble constant @xmath30 km s@xmath31 mpc@xmath32 and a deceleration parameter @xmath33 . for comparison to the most recent work in the field ( e.g. , cfrs and cnoc ) ,",
    "we use the ab - normalized @xmath18 band , @xmath6 ( oke 1974 ) . the offsets from @xmath6 to @xmath8 and @xmath18 are @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster has been described in detail in small et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , paper i of the current series , and will be only briefly reviewed here .",
    "the core of the supercluster covers a @xmath36 region of the sky centered at right ascension @xmath37 , declination @xmath38 and consists of 7 rich abell clusters at @xmath11 .",
    "since the field - of - view of the 176-fiber norris spectrograph is only 400 arcmin@xmath39 , we planned to observe 36 fields arranged in a rectangular grid with a grid spacing of 1 . as it turned out ,",
    "we successfully observed 23 of the fields and 9 additional fields along the ridge of galaxies between abell 2061 and abell 2067 , yielding redshifts for 1491 extragalactic objects .",
    "we have extended our survey with 163 redshifts from the literature , resulting in 1654 redshifts in the entire survey .",
    "1022 of these galaxies lie beyond the corona borealis supercluster , although of these 1022 , 325 ( 318 with @xmath4 ) galaxies are in a background supercluster ( @xmath13 ) which we have dubbed the `` abell 2069 supercluster . ''",
    "the survey fields are distributed across an area of 25 deg@xmath39 . the total area covered by the 32 observed fields ,",
    "albeit sparsely sampled , is 2.99 deg@xmath39 .",
    "as noted above and described in detail in paper i , the objects have been selected from poss - ii photographic plates of poss - ii field 449 , which neatly covers the entire core of the supercluster .",
    "we have both a @xmath24 ( kodak iii - aj emulsion with a gg395 filter ) plate and an @xmath25 ( kodak iii - af emulsion with a rg610 filter ) plate .",
    "the plates were digitized with 1 arcsec@xmath39 pixels at the space telescope science institute and then processed using the sky image cataloging and analysis tool ( skicat , @xcite ) .",
    "the instrumental intensities recorded by skicat were calibrated with ccd sequences in the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands of galaxies in abell 2069 .",
    "the random magnitude errors are 0.25@xmath40 for @xmath23 and @xmath7 brighter than 21@xmath40 and become substantially worse at fainter magnitudes .",
    "( we describe how we correct our computed lfs for these magnitude errors in  3.2 . ) with the skicat system , the star - galaxy separation is 90% accurate to @xmath41 .",
    "our lf analysis is limited to galaxies with @xmath42 .",
    "since our original motivation for the survey was to study the dynamics of the corona borealis supercluster , we chose a comparatively high spectral resolution for a faint galaxy redshift survey .",
    "a third of the objects were observed with @xmath43spectral resolution during the period when the largest ccd available at palomar was a 1024@xmath39 device with 24  pixels ; the rest were observed with @xmath44  resolution with a very efficient 2048@xmath39 ccd ( also with 24   pixels ) .",
    "since the operation of retrieving the fibers for one set - up and redeploying the fibers for another takes roughly an hour with the norris spectrograph , we decided to observe only two fields per night in order to minimize the amount of time lost due to changing fields .",
    "thus , our exposures were 2 - 4 hours long , and we generally obtained high quality spectra on @xmath45 galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ figures : success ] , we plot our success rate , the fraction of objects ( i.e. , including stars and quasars ) on which fibers were deployed for which we successfully measured redshifts , as a function of magnitude . figure [ figures : success ] shows that our success rate falls substantially below unity beyond @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we have computed weights for each galaxy to correct for a our incomplete sampling .",
    "the weight for a particular object is defined to be simply the ratio of the total number of objects in the photometric catalog to the number of objects with redshifts in an interval of @xmath47 centered on the magnitude of the object .",
    "this prescription assumes that the redshift distribution of the objects for which we failed to measure redshifts is identical to the redshift distribution of the objects for which we successfully measured redshifts .",
    "the color distribution of the objects that we observed but failed to identify is similar to that of the objects that we successfully observed , leading us to conclude that we do not suffer biases against particular types of galaxies ( paper i ) .",
    "moreover , we do not believe that we should have redshift - dependent biases in our success rate .",
    "since we limit the computation of the lf to @xmath48 , we are unlikely to be affected by a bias in redshift .",
    "the 4000  break and ca h , ca k lines of old stellar populations and the [ ] line of star - forming galaxies are all within our spectral range out to @xmath1 .",
    "we plot the calculated weights as a function of @xmath7 magnitude for all galaxies with @xmath42 and which satisfy our surface brightness threshold ( see below ) in figure [ figures : weights ] .",
    "the weights are greater than unity even for bright galaxies because of the sparse sampling of our survey area .",
    "( since the very brightest galaxies ( @xmath49 ) produce scattered light contamination of nearby spectra on the ccd , we usually did not place fibers on galaxies with @xmath49 , and thus the weights increase for the very brightest galaxies . )    in paper i , we carefully studied the surface brightness selection effects present in our sample .",
    "we found that by restricting our sample to objects with @xmath42 and with core magnitudes @xmath50 ( where the core magnitude is the integrated magnitude within the central 9 arcsec@xmath39 ) , we are free from surface brightness selection effects . for comparison , @xmath51 corresponds to a central surface brightness of @xmath52 @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath53 for a galaxy with an @xmath54 ( @xmath55 mag in the @xmath7 band ) disk .",
    "we compute galaxy lfs in the rest - frame @xmath6 band and , for the local lf , in the rest - frame gunn @xmath7 band as well .",
    "rest - frame colors and @xmath56-corrections are computed from the spectral energy distributions compiled by coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 , hereafter ccw ) .",
    "we assign each galaxy a spectral type based on its @xmath57 color and its redshift .",
    "following lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the spectral type is a real number which takes the values 0 for an elliptical galaxy , 2 for an sbc galaxy , 3 for an scd galaxy , and 4 for an i m galaxy .",
    "we then interpolate between the ccw spectral energy distributions to construct the spectral energy distribution appropriate for the given spectral type .",
    "galaxies whose colors are redder than a ccw e galaxy or bluer than a ccw i m galaxy are simply assigned the spectral energy distribution of an e galaxy or an i m galaxy , respectively . the number of galaxies with colors outside the limits defined by the ccw e and i m types is known to be small even to large redshifts ( e.g. , crampton et al .",
    "the fact that many of our galaxies lie outside the ccw limits ( see figure 17 , paper i ) is due to the large errors in our colors ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we compute the absolute rest - frame @xmath6-band magnitude as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 incorporates the corrections based on the spectral energy distribution and @xmath61 is the luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "the @xmath62 term represents the change in the bandwidth with redshift and is included in the traditional @xmath56-correction . again following lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we separate the bandwidth stretching term , which has negligible error since it depends only on the accurately measured redshift , from the terms which depend on the spectral energy distribution and are therefore much more uncertain .",
    "we plot @xmath60 for the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands in figure [ figures : keff ] . by converting from @xmath63 for objects with @xmath64 and from @xmath65 for objects with @xmath66",
    ", @xmath60 may be kept less than @xmath67 for @xmath68 for all spectral types .",
    "we use the step - wise maximum - likelihood ( swml ) method of efstathiou , ellis , & peterson ( 1988 ) to estimate the lf .",
    "the probability of observing a galaxy of absolute magnitude @xmath69 at redshift @xmath70 in a flux - limited catalog is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the lf and @xmath73 is the intrinsically faintest galaxy observable at @xmath70 in the flux - limited catalog .",
    "the lf is parameterized as a set of @xmath74 numbers @xmath75 such that @xmath76 and then the likelihood , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of galaxies in the sample , is maximized with respect to the @xmath75 .",
    "we constrain the values of @xmath75 to satisfy @xmath79 the virtues of the swml method are that it is not biased by the presence of clustering since the normalization of the lf cancels out of the expression for the probability @xmath80 and also that one does not have to assume a particular functional form for the lf . in order to include the weights , we make the substitution @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the weight of galaxy @xmath83 ( zucca , pozzetti , & zamorani 1994 , lin et al .",
    "one must then estimate the mean galaxy density separately .",
    "we use a standard technique which we describe below .",
    "since the weights are greater than one , their use will increase the calculated likelihood for the sample and thus lead to artificially small error estimates . by renormalizing the weights so that @xmath84 , the error estimates are appropriate for the true sample size ( lin et al . 1996b ) .",
    "note that the normalization constraint on the @xmath75 reduces the estimated errors .",
    "we do not use the traditional @xmath85 method ( @xcite ) employed by ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) since the method is sensitive to clustering .",
    "we have , however , compared the results of the two techniques for samples with @xmath86 , where the clustering in our survey is not pronounced , and found that they agree satisfactorily . for @xmath87",
    ", we can construct volume - limited sub - samples with @xmath4 in which any galaxy with @xmath88 is visible in the entire volume .",
    "of course , the value of the lf in a given magnitude bin for a volume - limited sample is estimated by counting the number galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the bin and then dividing by the volume of the sample and the width of the bin .",
    "the swml lfs for @xmath87 agree well with the lfs estimated from the volume - limited samples .",
    "we compute the mean density @xmath89 of a magnitude - limited sub - sample using the following estimator : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the volume of the sample , @xmath78 is the number of objects in the sample , and @xmath92 is the selection function .",
    "the selection function , @xmath93 gives the fraction of the lf observable at a given redshift .",
    "here , @xmath94 is the lf , @xmath95 is the maximum absolute magnitude that an object can have at redshift @xmath96 and still be included in the sample , and @xmath97 is the absolute magnitude of the most instrinsically faint galaxy in the sample . in practice , one does not begin evaluating the integrals at @xmath98 , but rather at the absolute magnitude of the most instrinsically bright galaxy in the sample . the estimator in equation [ equations : mean_density ]",
    "is almost identical to the minimum variance estimator derived by davis & huchra ( 1982 ) for @xmath99 and is unbiased by density inhomogeneities .",
    "an additional complication of computing a lf in the @xmath6 band where the objects have been selected in the @xmath7 band is that one must ensure that any object , regardless of its color , would have been detectable in both bands .",
    "if one ignores this complication , then the faintest objects at a given redshift will be biased in color . in our survey , since the @xmath7 band is centered at a longer wavelength than the @xmath18 band , the faintest objects would be biased to the red . in order to avoid such a bias ,",
    "we adjust our absolute @xmath6 magnitude limits as a function of redshift so that the bluest galaxy at any @xmath6 magnitude limit would be observable in the @xmath7 band .",
    "for the local lf computed in the @xmath7 band , the bias works in the opposite sense , and so we adjust our rest - frame absolute @xmath7 magnitude limits to ensure that the reddest galaxy a given limit would be detected in the observed @xmath7 band .    for each lf , we estimate the parameters of the best - fitting schechter ( 1976 ) function , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the normalization , @xmath102 determines the location of the bright - end exponential cutoff , and @xmath103 is the faint - end slope .",
    "the fitting was performed using a standard @xmath104-minimization algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) with the schechter function integrated over the width of the adopted magnitude bin .",
    "we intend these fits to be useful for comparisons with other work . usually , there are too few points for the fits to be well defined",
    ".    our random magnitude errors ( @xmath105 ) will artificially brighten the characteristic magnitude @xmath102 of the lf and steepen the faint end .",
    "we correct for the magnitude errors by fitting to the data points a schechter function ( equation [ equations : schechter ] ) convolved with a gaussian of dispersion @xmath106 ( efstathiou et al .",
    "in fact , however , the corrections to the schechter function parameters are substantially less than the 1@xmath107 statistical errors .",
    "the error in the normalization from the @xmath104-fitting only includes the uncertainties due to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the error due to large - scale structure fluctuations is @xmath108 ( davis & huchra 1982 ) , where @xmath109 is the second moment of the two - point spatial correlation function ( peebles 1980 ) and @xmath91 is the appropriate volume .",
    "we use @xmath110 ( @xmath111 mpc)@xmath112 ( tucker et al . 1997 ) and record the error from density fluctuations alongside the uncertainty in @xmath101 due to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in the following subsections , we report our results for the local lf , the evolution of the lf , and the lfs of the corona borealis and abell 2069 superclusters .",
    "all samples are magnitude - limited at @xmath113 .",
    "the parameters of the best fitting schechter functions are summarized in table 1 , where the sample is given in the first column , the number of galaxies used to compute the lf in the second column , the absolute range over which the fit is valid in the third column , @xmath101 in the fourth column , @xmath102 in the fifth column , @xmath103 in the sixth column , the reduced @xmath104 in the seventh column , and the estimate of the variance due to density fluctuations in the eighth column .",
    "the numbers of galaxies listed in the second column are slightly smaller than the total number of galaxies satisfying the sample listed in the first column because a few galaxies have been trimmed from each sample , as described above , to ensure that there are no color biases in the faintest bins",

    "in addition , the mass and metallicity are , compared to morphology and even gas absorption cross section ( churchill , steidel , & vogt 1996 ) , straightforward to define and interpret . a survey to measure the masses and chemical abundances of the faint blue galaxies ought to yield important insights into the nature of this rapidly evolution galaxy population and aid in the identification of their present - day counterparts .",

    "in particular , it is quite reassuring that our lfs agree well with those of lin et al .",
    "( 1996a ) since both used the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands and should therefore have very similar systematic effects .",
    "the lfs of the two superclusters show significant differences from the field galaxy lf , despite considerable overall similarity .",
    "since the superclusters are @xmath214 denser than the field , we are likely to be observing the influence of the environment on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the most prominent difference is an excess of very bright galaxies ( @xmath208 ) relative to the best - fitting schechter function , which accurately describes the field lf over the observed absolute magnitude range .",

    "while there is also a suggestion of an upturn in the local field galaxy lf for the least luminous galaxies in our survey , it does not appear as dramatic as the upturn seen in the supercluster lf , but more data are needed before the possible difference can be quantified .",

    "<S> we measure the field galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) as a function of color and redshift from @xmath0 to @xmath1 using galaxies from the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster . </S>",
