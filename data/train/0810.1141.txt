    "soft x - ray transients ( sxrts ) are a subset of the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) which are thought to contain a black hole primary , and undergo periodic brightening episodes lasting a few months , with recurrence times of a few years ( tanaka & shibazaki , 1996 )",
    ". the outburst episodes typically coincide with spectral and timing changes , for example the x - ray _",
    "high / soft _ state ( thermal emission when accretion is high ) and the x - ray _ low / hard _ state ( coronal / jet or optically thin disc emission when accretion is low ; review in remillard & mcclintock , 2006 ) .",
    "such changes are attributed to varying contributions from the various emission mechanisms e.g. , dense disc , jet , low density zone ( e.g. , van der klis , 2006 ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that such a classification may be simplistic , as some systems have been seen to go into outbursts without changing their x - ray state .",
    "it is a challenge to understand , in these cases , what indeed is changing ( e.g. , meyer - hofmeister , 2004 ) .",
    "two main models exist as possible explanations for the low / hard state in accreting binaries .",
    "the first and oldest is the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , e.g. , czerny et al .",
    "2000 ) model , in which the accretion disc is truncated at a large inner radius , and the relatively inefficient adaf channels matter to the compact object and to any jets ; this region is low - density and responsible for the high - energy emission . in a typical outburst cycle , the accretion disc gains enough mass to overwhelm the adaf , and fast accretion progresses until the disc is depleted , whereupon the adaf reforms from small radii to large .",
    "the contender model , the accretion disc corona ( adc ; e.g. , malzac , 2007 ) is not dissimilar in its effects , but the mechanism is subtly different .",
    "a hot corona of energetic particles may form above and below an accretion disc , and most of the accretion power is carried by strong magnetic fields .",
    "when the fields in the corona are strong , the emission from the corona is strong , and a higher proportion of in - falling material is channelled into the jets .",
    "when the mass - flow rate increases beyond a critical level , however , enough soft x - ray photons are emittied by the disc to efficiently cool the corona , causing it to condense onto the disc , halting the chanelling of energy and particles away from the core region , which then dominates the emitted spectrum with thermal radiation from small radii . note that this model was developed initially fpr sources where the central accretion disc is obscured by the outer torus of material , making the adc relatively more important .    in general , it may be assumed that both processes , with their different physical mechanisms , occur in systems either simultaneously or episodically .",
    "the most obvious difference between the two is that for the adc , the accretion disc extends down to very small radii , to the last stable orbit in the case of a black - hole system .",
    "the transitions between accretion modes and feedback in the systems is very poorly understood , however .",
    "it seems not to be purely a function of accretion rate , and there certainly appears to be hysteresis in all the transient systems , as typically depicted by their path through the x - ray hardness - luminosity diagram ( homan & belloni , 2005 ) .",
    "one object which has received a lot of attention in recent times , being an out - lier in the sxrt population , is xte j1118 + 480  ( chaty et al .",
    "this system was thoroughly observed through outburst to quiescence in x - rays , uv , optical and radio ( hynes at al .",
    "2003 ) , and showed interesting breaks and possible qpos in its periodograms ( shahbaz et al .",
    "being high above the galactic plane , it has been suggested that xte j1118 + 480  belongs to a new population of black hole binaries , with the question of how they can appear in the halo still open ( mcclintock et al .",
    "xte j1118 + 480  is one of the few systems which does not follow the typical path for an sxrt through x - ray hardness / luminosity space : it stayed in the low / hard state throughout .",
    "it is also the only system for which a high signal-to.noise optical / x - ray cross - correlation has been calculated , which showed an unexpected `` precursor '' anti - correlation with optical leading x - rays ( and a stronger positive resonse ; kanbach et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the sxrt swift j1753.5@xmath00127  is an x - ray transient system which has been of great interest recently following its outburst episode and detailed observations with the _ swift _ satellite .",
    "first discovered by the _ swift_/bat ( burst alert telescope ; palmer et al . ,",
    "2005 ) in 2005 , pointed @xmath1-ray , x - ray , uv , optical and radio observations all detected a new bright source at this location ( morris et al .",
    ", 2005 ; still et al . , 2005 ; halpern et al . , 2005 ; fender et al . , 2005",
    ". _ swift_/xrt ( x - ray telescope ; burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) , and _ rxte _ ( rossi x - ray timing explorer ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) observations detected the existence of a strong 0.6hz quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ; morgan et al .",
    "2005 ; ramadevi & seetha , 2005 ) , persistent for some time after the outburst episode .",
    "this qpo has so far only been seen in x - ray observations .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented the evolution of the qpo frequency with time after the outburst , and its relationship to x - ray hardness .",
    "with a high galactic latitude , comparisons with xte j1118 + 480  promise to be very interesting .    summarizing the above works very briefly , after a fast initial rise in x - ray flux , the source returned to its previous level , almost undetectable by the rxte all - sky monitor , in a few months ( rise time of 4.5 days , decay of an exponential time - scale initially @xmath232d , later @xmath2100d , peak flux @xmath20.2crab in the rxte / pca or swift / xrt band ) . throughout , it remained hard in x- and @xmath1-rays ( a rising spectrum in @xmath3 out to @xmath2200kev ) , suggesting a hot comptonizing corona ( adc ) . the optical counterpart also faded , but the fade slowed , and it remains relatively bright and blue .",
    "h@xmath4 and he lines were originally observed , double - peaked , but disappeared after the initial outburst ( torres , 2005 ) .",
    "the accretion disc inclination is thus non - negligible , but neither is it extreme ( @xmath5 ) , since eclipses are never observed .",
    "the h@xmath4 line was not particularly strong ( equivalent width @xmath6 ) but very broad ( fwhm@xmath22000kms@xmath7 ) . from the nai doublet and uv observations ,",
    "the extinction equivalent to @xmath8@xmath9 and a distance of @xmath10kpc have been estimated .",
    "the radio spectrum was variable and consistent with a flat power law ( @xmath11 ) which lies underneath the optical points , if extrapolated ( fender et al .",
    "this suggests that , initially at least , the optical emission did not appear like a typical synchrotron spectrum .    cadolle bel et al .",
    "( 2007 ; cb07 from hereon ) performed follow - up simultaneous multi - wavelength observations .",
    "they identify swift j1753.5@xmath00127  as a likely black - hole candidate , which stayed in a low / hard state throughout its outburst and gradual fade .",
    "they also detected a qpo in their x - ray data , but weaker , and at the somewhat lower frequency of 0.24hz .",
    "such a reduction in the frequency is consistent with what would be expected for the inner radius of an accretion disc , which expands during the decaying lifetime of the outburst in the adaf model .",
    "the integral count - rate during their observation was constant at 43ctss@xmath7 ( @xmath12mcrab between 20320kev ) , with a hardness ratio @xmath13 .",
    "they also found a flat radio spectrum with fluxes of the order 0.65mjy .",
    "miller et al .",
    "( 2006a ) observed swift j1753.5@xmath00127  some months after the outburst episode above with xmm - newton and rxte , when the source was assumed to have reached quiescence .",
    "their spectral modelling indicated a prominent accretion disc was required by the x - ray spectrum with high significance .",
    "this disc is cool ( @xmath14kev ) , and extends to very small radii near the last inner stable orbit .",
    "this model would pose problems for models of low - level accretion involving an adaf region near the central source , and complicate jet - formation scenarios .",
    "an adaf model is commonly invoked to explain the existence of a jet in the low / hard state and its absence in the high / soft state , in systems where both states have been observed ( e.g. , fender , 2006 ) .",
    "we have conducted a comprehensive observational campaign of swift j1753.5@xmath00127 , including optical photomety in different filters on five successive nights , with @xmath15min time resolution , contemporary x - ray observations , optical spectroscopy and high time - resolution optical observations with ultracam . here",

    "( 2008 ) were approximately contemporary with our observations .",
    "further to our own observations below , we retrieved the rossi all sky monitor ( ams ; levine et al . , 1996 ) daily average count rates for swift j1753.5@xmath00127 , as well as regular monitoring observations by the gamma - ray satellite integral s wide - field lower energy - band imaging instrument isgri ( integral soft gamma - ray instrument ; lebrun et al .",
    "these are shown in figure [ asm ] .",
    "the asm observes the whole sky , and integral surveys the galactic centre regularly , and all interesting bright objects are automatically measured .",
    "these data are publicly available ( the reduction is not described here , see the references above ) .",
    "swift j1753.5@xmath00127  was observed for 53.6min each on 11 jun 2007 and 13 jun 2007 with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) .",
    "rxte comprises three instruments : the proportional counting array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) for soft - band pointed observations with large effective area , the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ) for energies up to 200kev and the all - sky monitor ( asm , see above ) , with a very large effective field of view .",
    "none are imaging instruments , but provide high temporal resolution .",
    "for the first observation , only two of the pca units were functional , and in the second observation , three .",
    "we use only the pca light curves in our timing analysis , since the count rates are so much higher than the high - energy hexte count rates .",
    "the latter we only use in the spectral fitting .",
    "events were processed through the standard pipeline for both the pca and hexte data - sets .",
    "standard good time intervals were applied and we selected all events flagged as good for further analysis .",
    "we generated light curves by binning the events on a regular grid ; uncertainties on each sample are dominated by photon counting noise .",
    "when a fluxed spectrum is generated from the data , using the instrument response functions , the hexte and pca parts of the spectrum do not appear to meet : there seems to be a 15% discrepancy , which corresponds to the effect of dead time .",
    "we corrected for this and performed our spectral analysis on these data .",
    "we observed swift j1753.5@xmath00127  with the 2.2 m nordic optical telescope ( not ; 2007 jun 16 , 17 ) and the 1.5 m mercator ( 2007 jun 18 , 19 , 20 ) telescopes at roque de los muchachos observatory , la palma , spain . in each case",
    ", we performed ccd - based imaging with exposure times of 60s . with the not we acquired images in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters , and with the mercator in the @xmath20 filters .",
    "standards were imaged with the not in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters , and the mercator photometry was calibrated via images of both the science field and standards fields with the iac80 telescope at the teide observatory , tenerife .",
    "the weather was generally good , especially for the not run , with some variability and thin cloud during the mercator run .",
    "images were in every case first bias - subtracted , then flat - fielded using drift images of the twilight sky .",
    "note that the not / alfosc images were affected by unrepeatable electronic pick - up , and that the photometry was therefore somewhat degraded .",
    "photometry was measured in small apertures relative to a bright local reference in the field . for this",
    ", we used the ultracam pipeline , as below with the ultracam data .",
    "the local reference was in each case calibrated relative to the landolt standard list ( landolt , 1992 ) , correcting for a colour term for each filter set .",
    "having other stars in the field of similar brightness to swift j1753.5@xmath00127  enabled us to check that the analysis process was not introducing any systematic signal into the light curves .",
    "the uncertainty on each measurement is estimated from the photon statistics of the counts within an aperture and the sky background .",
    "our measurements are source photon noise dominated .",
    "we obtained spectra across the optical range with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the observatorio roque de los muchachos , la palma , spain . isis features twin spectrographs optimized for the red and blue end of the optical , which can be used simultaneously with the use of a dichroic in the main beam .",
    "we obtained 1.72 / pixel mean dispersion in the blue arm , and 1.65 / pixel in the red , with a mean resolution @xmath6  throughout , under good conditions .",
    "the two spectra were wavelength calibrated and extracted using standard iraf tools , and co - added into master spectra . in order not to lose any resolution when co - adding , each spectrum was first re - sampled to 0.5 .    to flux and produce the final spectrum , we observed a spectral standard at a similar airmass , and for both the object and the standard spectrum , summed together the red and blue parts into a single master spectrum ( sampled at 0.5 ) .",
    "since the dicroic provides a sharp but finite cut - off , calculating the response function for any one arm in the cut - off region is hard , but yet there are enough photons in total at any given wavelength to find the overall sensitivity .",
    "the final response curve we used to flux the data was a heavily smoothed version of the ratio of the tabulated flux to the measured counts for the standard .",
    "these observations were done one year after the outburst of swift j1753.5@xmath00127 , during the faintest part of the asm light curve since detection ( figure [ asm ] ) .",
    "we also obtained a spectrum of swift j1753.5@xmath00127  during our june observing campaign with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 , appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 ) on the 8.2 m unit telescope 1 ( antu ) of the vlt , cerro paranal , chile .",
    "this observation was simultaneous with one rxte and one ultracam observation .",
    "the spectral scale was 3.17 / pixel , and resolution @xmath21 .",
    "conditions were mediocre , with variable cloud cover , transparency and seeing .",
    "since the whole spectral range is obtained in a single go , the problems associated with matching two spectra ( above ) were not encountered here , and the extraction was straight - forward .",
    "in addition , swift j1753.5@xmath00127  was also observed with ultracam , mounted on the vlt/3 ( melipal ) telescope on the nights of 2007 jun 12 and 17 , for 1.3hr and 0.5hr respectively .",
    "ultracam is an instrument employing dichroic beam splitters , frame - transfer ccds and a gps - based timing system in order to be able to make simultaneous multi - wavelength optical light curves at very high time resolution , up to 500hz ( dhillon et al .",
    "we used two small windows on each ccd ( one for the source of interest , one for a local standard ) , with exposure times of 140ms for the 12th and 39ms for the 17th ( and duty cycles of 142ms and 41ms respectively ) .",
    "the reason for the difference in exposure times was thin cloud on the first of the two nights , giving similar signal - to - noise per image .",
    "the object was visible in every frame in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands , but not in the @xmath24 band .",
    "for the latter , therefore , the source could only be detected by co - adding many images , resulting in reduced temporal resolution but better signal - to - noise .",
    "on the first night , with the poor conditions , the effect was particularly strong , and we do not attempt to analyze these data . on the 17th , however , it was possible to get reasonable measurements from averages of every 50 images .",
    "thus it was not possible to search for high - frequency variability in these data , but timescales @xmath254s were accessible .",
    "fluxes were extracted by aperture photometry with a variable aperture size scaled to the fwhm of the reference star on each image .",
    "this enables some optimization for signal - to - noise under variable conditions .",
    "the optimal extraction method ( naylor , 1992 ) did not yield appreciably different results , since that method is more applicable to the faint , background - dominated regime .",
    "the night of the 2007 june 12 was badly affected by transparency variations .",
    "in addition , the comparison star chosen was of similar brightness to our source in @xmath22 and significantly redder , introducing additional uncertainty in @xmath22 and even more in @xmath23 .",
    "this is evidenced by the difference in the @xmath22-band and @xmath23-band light curves . only for the 17th",
    "can we give reliable average magnitudes , based on the calibrated zero - points of the instrument .",
    "these are on the sdss photometric system ( systematic uncertainties here are @xmath260.030.05mag , increasing to the blue ) . by the transformations given in jester et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the sdss average magnitudes correspond to v@xmath2716.62(5 ) , b@xmath2716.92(7 ) , consistent with the slow photometry above .",
    "the slow photometry has a better absolute calibration .",

    "+ @xmath28  due to the smaller number of points available , the fitting function only included one lorentzian .",
    "+     qualitatively , one can see a number of features common to the power spectra : a power law - like decay at high frequencies and a break around 0.07hz becoming flat in the 0.01hz range .",
    "some possible qpos can be seen at around 0.08hz in the optical power spectra but not in the x - ray ones , but with significance only at the 25@xmath16 level . the optical power spectra are all similar to one - another in this respect also .    for the @xmath24 band",
    ", we obtained a light curve by co - adding groups of 50 images , and analyzing these .",
    "the temporal resolution was thus degraded ( to about 2s ) , with still significant scatter in the measurements .",
    "this accounts for the different appearence of the @xmath24 band power spectrum in figure [ pgram4 ] ( the @xmath24-band power spectrum is the one with the least points ) .",
    "many of the same features can be seen in the power spectrum : red noise power law , break , excess in the 0.010.1hz region and a flat power spectrum at low frequencies .",
    "even a qpo is possibly seen , but not statistically significant .    by visual inspection",
    ", we find that the power spectrum continua are each well - fitted by zero - centred lorentzian functions ( as used by cb07 , for example ) .",
    "we have , therefore , fitted each power spectrum accordingly , and the result of these fits are shown in table [ pgramfits ] .",
    "also shown are what one would find assuming a power - law noise function for the high - frequency ( @xmath290.1hz ) part of each power spectrum .",
    "these numbers are consistent with _ flickering _ ( superposition of discreet , stochastic flares of various heights and durations ) , for which one expects a power - law exponent of 1 ( bruch , 1992 ) . the flattening of the power spectrum towards lower fequencies does not imply that this considerable power can not be produced by micro - flares , but implies that the micro - flares can not have arbritarily long durations .",
    "uttley & mchardy ( 2001 ) give arguments against a lorentzian and/or power - law power spectrum necessarily being produced by flickering ; specifically , if the average flux and variance of sections of the light - curve are linearly correlated , without the line passing through the origin .",
    "this is indeed to case here , and implies that although flickers can occur on a wide range of time - scales as measured by the power spectra , there is likely an extra component of constant or very small rms , perhaps the process which feeds the larger amplitude variability ( e.g. , merloni & fabian , 2001 ) .",
    "although the power spectra all look rather similar , the numbers presented in table [ pgramfits ] are not .",
    "if the ideas of uttley & mchardy are correct , then there seems to be a variable competition between the variable component and the low rms / constant component which depents both on time and spectral range . for the simultanous r and g numbers , the variability is consistently higher for the shorter wavelength , yet we see generally more variability in the optical than in the x - rays ( where , as already stated , we do not find significant qpos ) .",
    "any micro - flares must thus be rather blue , but damped in their effect on the x - ray emission .",
    "figure [ autocorr ] shows the auto - correlation functions for the fast timing observations of swift j1753.5@xmath00127 . this is a measure of",
    "how well each light curve is correlated with itself as a function of time difference , and therefore of the timescales dominant in the variability . in this sense , it complements the power spectrum , viewing the time - series from the point of view of individual events rather than coherent periodic signals .",
    "all the curves are well approximated by lorentzian functions .",
    "the x - ray autocorrelation functions are very narrow ( fwhm@xmath30s ) , implying that the variability seen at longer time - scales in the power spectra above are not very coherent .",
    "the wings of the auto - correlation do , however , seem to extend to large values , with continued structure .",
    "note that the apparent flat tops of the auto - correlations is due to excising the zero - lag value , which is contaminated by white noise .",
    "after this , the functions have simply been normalized to 1 .",
    "+     the optical auto - correlations in figure [ autocorr ] are all generally broader than their x - ray counterparts ( fwhm@xmath24s ) .",
    "one would normally expect this from a consideration of the energy scales : higher - energy emission is produced in an optically thin medium , and can escape easily .",
    "the @xmath24 curve is consistent with the others from the night of the 17th , given its lower sampling rate .",
    "the optical auto - correlation functions also show some structure at larger lags , which we havent shown as it would make the central peaks hard to see .    in durant",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) we present the cross - correlation functions between various energy bands of the rxte / pcu and the ultracam observations .",
    "we find that there is a strong anti - correlation with the optical arriving earlier than the x - rays on timescales of 110s , followed by a much weaker positive response after @xmath31 , for the softest x - ray energies .",
    "this is a similar result to the `` precursor '' signal in the cross - correlation function derived for xte j1118 + 480  by kanbach et al ( 2001 ) . for medium energies ,",
    "the correlation function is similar but narrower , and we find no correlation for high x - ray energies ( where noise dominates ) .",
    "please refer to this paper for further details .",
    "we produced dynamic power spectra ( based on successive small sections of each light curve ) from our rapid timing observations .    at first glance ,",
    "the dynamic power spectra show the same information as the average power spectra above : power concentrated in the 0.010.1hz range , with no abrupt changes thoughout the observation windows .",
    "the two sets of optical dynamis power spectra taken simultanously look identical .",
    "for the x - ray , the fluctuation with time is totally consistent with noise . for the optical , however , there is a hint of structure , but again nothing that can be significantly distiguished from noise .",
    "a summary of our results:- swift j1753.5@xmath00127  has not returned to a quiescent state , either in x - rays ( asm data ) , gamma - rays ( integral data ) or optical ; rather , it seems to have re - brightened somewhat , compared to one year before our observations .",
    "we do not know the current state of radio emission , only the upper limits of soleri et al .",
    "the optical light curves show superhump - like modulations with a period of 3.2hr , increasingly significant towards the blue , but not detected in x - rays .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well - described by a single power law of spectral index @xmath32 from 260kev , with hints of a possible soft disc component and an emission line near 6kev .",
    "the optical spectrum shows no sharp features beyond interstellar ones , only small deviations from a power law .",
    "the sed shows a need for separate components for each wave - band , in particular , that the optical can not be a continuation of a flat synchrotron - dominated spectrum .",
    "in contrast to previous observations , we find no significant qpos in power spectra of the x - ray light curves , but we do find @xmath20.08hz qpos in the optical ; aside from these , all power spectra are well - described by two zero - centred lorentzian functions , with widths @xmath20.05hz and @xmath21.5hz .",
    "autocorrelation functions show a narrower peak ( @xmath22s ) for the x - ray emission than the optical ( @xmath64s ) , which are consistent with one - another for all the @xmath33 bands .",
    "the cross - correlation functions ( durant et al . 2008 ) show the optical leading by 110s and strongly anti - correlated with the x - rays , for the lower energies of the rxte range .",
    "dynamic power spectra show features which may be short - lived qpos in the 0.02 - 0.1hz region , more poorly defined in the x - rays than in the optical .    from the work of cb07 and zurita",
    "( 2008 ) , we suspect that the system contains a stellar - mass black hole and m2v - type companion ( which has an undetectable contribution to the current total optical luminosity of the binary ) , and is located at a distance of several kpc , significantly above the galactic plane ( in the _ halo _ , since its height of order @xmath34kpc is much larger than the disc scale height ) .",
    "our measurement of interstellar absorption , particularly of na , strongly supports a large distance but also suggests an unknown amount of absorbtion internal to the system .",
    "the optical evolution of this source since its 2005 outburst and discovery is more completely analyzed in zurita et al .",
    "it is clear that the compact object in the system , probably a black hole , is continuing to accrete material , which is powering the observed luminosity .",
    "the system was not observed to leave its low / hard state , indicating that some low density / high energy region continued to exist throughout the outburst phase and afterwards .",
    "the x - ray spectrum has changed very little , except for the bolometric luminosity .",
    "there is apparent evolution in the overall shape of the optical spectrum between cb07 , wht / isis and vlt / fors2 representing two years of the system s life since outburst .",
    "this is also seen in the broad - band photometry values in table [ photvalues ] compared to cb07 - these are a more accurate measure of the change of spectral slope .",
    "the wiggles in the wht / isis spectrum are not present either earlier ( cb07 ) or later ( out vlt / fors and not / alfosc ) spectra .    the smooth continuum and the lack of lines in maintained throughout , although hydrogen ( h@xmath4 ) emission was seen immediately after the outburst ( torres et al , 2005 ) .",
    "the red part of the spectrum changes very little , and indeed the r - band magnitude has remained remarkably constant ( see zurita et al .",
    "the blue part of the spectrum has changed , however : the large peak at @xmath24000 dip at @xmath24500  and second peak at @xmath25000  seen in cb07 were not evident in 2006 , but had recovered to some extent by 2007 .",
    "it would appear that the process which had caused the enhanced emission during the outburst flare is continuing at a lower level , and that this had maintained the optical emission through the two - year period .",
    "ongoing activity is also suggested by the asm and integral light curves .    in terms of timing , the gross power spectrum has remained qualitatively similar : flat at low frequencies and flickering at high frequencies .",
    "a qpo was , however , initially detected at 0.6hz by morgan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and later at 0.4hz by ramadevi & seetha ( 2005 ) ; an evolution that was tracked in many rxte observations by zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; in this work we see such a qpo , relatively weak , but only in the optical data and not in the x - rays , and at a much lower frequency .",
    "the slowing of characteristic qpo frequencies and time - scales has been seen for other transient systems ( mcclintock & remillard , 2006 ; shahbaz et al . 2005 , 2003 ) , and is commonly taken to indicate an expanding inner radius of the accretion disc , inside of which a low density adaf region forms .",
    "the linking of such a qpo frequency with keplarian periods may be misleading , however : it is not obvious how a rotation rate translates into luminosity variations , and why there would exist preferred orbits within the disc .",
    "if for this system a disc existed at small radii well after the outburst ( as suggested by miller et al .",
    "2006a ) , then the frequency characterised by the qpos seen can not have a keplerian interpretation .",
    "more simple origins for variability might be disc - corona - jet interaction , turbulence timescales or magnetic field production / migration timescales ; these might depend on factors such as accretion rate , magnetic / particle energy balance , jet efficiency , disc density profile etc .",
    "why these in turn should evolve raises further questions ; recurrent outbursting episodes suggested hysteresis in x - ray transients ( e.g. , malzac , 2007 ) , but the maintenance of a low / hard state in this case would imply only a small change in the mass flow rate . the re - brightening of the source since 2006 , and its associated bluer optical colours point to somewhat increasing mass flow from 2006 to 2007 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is typical of comptonized emission from a population of energetic particles .",
    "this in turn requires a source of lower energy photons to scatter ( possibly seen at the lowest edge of our x - ray spectrum , and claimed by miller at al .",
    "2006 , and ramadevi & seetha , 2007 ) and a replenishable energy reservoir in the particles . at the same time , we suggested the possibility of a contribution of cyclotron emission in the optical , requiring significant energy content in the magnetic field .",
    "note that beloborodov ( 1999 ) showed that emission from magnetically driven clouds moving away from the disc would not produce significant re - processing in cooler material , if the bulk motion was mildly relativistic .",
    "we can not exclude either a static optically thick syclotron emitting region nor multiple blackbodies where particular temperatures are favoured . from the cross - correlation",
    ", we can discount simple reprocessing being an important factor in the optical emission .",
    "the case is further complicated by the _",
    "superhump _ contribution .",
    "this accounts for about 10% of the variation in the optical region , but increasing towards the uv . if it is indeed due to a superhump process ( i.e. , either tidal resonance between the disc and orbital periods , or changing area of the disc ; haswell et al .",
    "2001 ) , then the emission is thermal and very hot with a black - body - like peak blueward of b. we do not see any lines from this emission , but we do not have good spectral sensitivity shortward of 400 nm .",
    "the 2006 wht spectrum showed less of a blue component .",
    "this could also be the reason that no qpo was seen in the @xmath24-band power spectrum - thermal emission may already be dominating at these energies .",
    "finally there is the case of jet emission .",
    "malzac et al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented a model for how jet and disc emission could be coupled in a black hole system such as this .",
    "jet radio emission was certainly seen earlier , closer to the onset of the outburst ( cb07 ; fender et al . 2005 ) , and soleri et al s limits are not stringent enough to exclude even a stronger jet than before .",
    "jet / synchrotron emission can not , however , be significant in the optical .      in durant",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) we suggest that the cross - correlation function implies that the optically emitting region was driving rather than responding to the higher - energy emission . here",
    "we add to this that the optical auto - correlation functions are _ broader _ than the x - rays , so it would appear that a relatively slowly building process in the optical leads to a faster and anti - correlated x - ray response .",
    "furthermore , the power spectra show that this process occurs as a distribution of small flares ( flickering ) , with a break at a characteristic time - scale corresponding to a period of @xmath35s .",
    "although malzac et al .",
    "( 2007 ) produced a model considering the dynamic interaction of a jet and accretion disc , in an effort to explain the optical / x - ray cross - correlation function for xte j1118 + 480 , they explicitly consider only optical emission dominated by synchrotron emission , with some additional x - ray re - processing by dense disc material . in our case ,",
    "the optical is not a simple continuation of a synchrotron spectrum int he radio ( which extrapolates to below the optical emission ) ; nevertheless , the idea of a magnetic energy reservoir may still be valid , as it can produce the types of dynamic behaviour and feedback observed here .",
    "we would be interested to see if their model has a parameter space to match the details given here .",
    "it is interesting to note , that swift j1753.5@xmath00127  is the highest galactic latitude sxrt after xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "the latter object shows some of the same characteristics , which set it apart from the bulk of the sxrt population : short - period superhump / orbital modulation of 4.1hr , a persistent low / hard state , similar power spectra and unusually bright optical emission ( hynes et al .",
    ", 2003 ; shahbaz et al .",
    "the x - ray / optical cross - correlation function for xte j1118 + 480  was the first to unambiguously show an optical - leading anti - correlation component ( `` precognition peak '' , in some sources ) , although a positive , standard , optical lag signal was dominant ( kanbach et al .",
    "2001 ) .    unlike swift j1753.5@xmath00127 , xte j1118 + 480",
    "did settle into quiescence . in this state xte j1118",
    "+ 480  also showed a power spectrum which could be described as a power law with break or power law plus qpo .",
    "one interpretation of this is to connect this characteristic frequency with the inner edge of the accretion disc : asthe disc - adaf interface increases in radius , the system decreased in luminosity ( shahbaz et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "can the changes of state really be explained by variable accretion rate alone ?",
    "a leading anticorrelation was seen once for gx 339@xmath04  in the past ( motch et al .",
    "1983 ) . since this initial and unconfirmed measurement , based on a very short observation window , gx 339@xmath04  has changed markedly . in particular , gandhi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find the cross - correlation is very different and weak , in a fainter state , although optical and x - ray spectral characteristics have not changed much .",
    "assuming that the threshold for an x - ray binary to leave the low - hard state ( where the x - ray spectrum is predominantly a power law , rather than thermal ) is 1 percent of the eddington luminosity ( mcclintock & remillard , 2006 ) , we can place a limit on the black hole mass in this system , under several assumptions . if the bolometric luminosity can be scaled from cb07 to the peak observed luminosity at the time of outburst , i.e. , if the spectrum remained the same throughout the process , then for a distance @xmath36kpc we can place the limit @xmath37 zurita et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggest that a stellar - mass black hole ( @xmath38 ) and m - type star adequately fit the orbital period and quiescent ( i.e. , pre - outburst ) luminosity of the system . only by obtaining a radial - velocity curve and rotational velocity of the donor star , combined with ellipsoidal light curves",
    "can the black hole mass be concretely established .",
    "we have conducted optical and x - ray simultaneous spectral and timing observations of swift j1753.5@xmath00127 , while the x - ray binary was still in an active state following its 2005 outburst .",
    "we find a superhump - like blue modulation and remarkably featureless emission in the optical , and hard power - law spectrum in the x - ray , with possible thermal and iron k - line contributions .",
    "the power spectra are similar in x - rays and optical , flat below 0.05hz and decreasing at higher frequencies , except that the optical power spectra show @xmath20.08hz qpos .",
    "dynamic power spectra show these qpos to be discreet signals wandering in frequency and persistent on timescales of @xmath210min .",
    "these , together with the respective auto- and cross - correlation functions and possible cyclotron emission , suggest that magnetic processes tie together the disc and high - energy emission .",
    "similar features have been seen for two other interesting sxrts , xte j1118 + 480  and gx 339@xmath04 .",
    "one suggested reason for the difference of these sources to normal sxrts is that the accretion disc extends right in to the inner - most stable orbit .",
