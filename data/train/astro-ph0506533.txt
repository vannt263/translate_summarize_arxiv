    "the abundances of sulfur  bearing molecules like so@xmath1 , are expected to be enhanced in hot cores by several orders of magnitude with respect to the quiescent gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , these hot cores have been mainly detected in objects whose luminosities are larger than 10@xmath20@xmath0l@xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "cepheus a ( cepa ) , with a total ir luminosity of 2@xmath610@xmath20@xmath0l@xmath16 , is a very active region of massive star formation .",
    "it contains sixteen ultracompact h@xmath0ii regions , molecular outflows and water vapor masers ( e.g. @xcite ) . the main powering source in the region",
    "is believed to be the thermal radio  jet , known as hw2 , which is the brightest of the radio continuum sources in the region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surroundings of hw2 show a rather complex structure .",
    "the morphology of the hw2 radio  jet suggests the presence of a disk of neutral gas whose size is unknown .",
    "@xcite reported evidence for water masers in a rotating and collapsing disk around the radio  jet .",
    "however , the warm molecular gas ( about 50@xmath0k ) around hw2 shows a ring like structure with complex kinematics which does not seem to be consistent with a simple rotating disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the expected neutral disk , within a few hundred au of the radio  jet , there is clear evidence for very recent star formation .",
    "two radio continuum sources detected by @xcite , one of them claimed to be the source of the expanding bubble found in h@xmath1o masers ( @xcite ) , are very likely protostars .",
    "furthermore , the multiple outflow activity ( hayashi , hasegawa , & kaifu 1988 ; @xcite ) seems to be powered by three different young stellar objects in the surroundings of hw2 ( @xcite ) .",

    "the level populations of both molecules can be fitted by straight lines with similar excitation temperatures of 150160@xmath0k , indicating the presence of a hot condensation ( hereafter hc ) .",
    "we have constrained the size of the hc by using the upper limit to the size measured from the interferometric maps of 0.6@xmath5 , and the lower limit of 0.3@xmath5 derived from the measured main beam brightness temperature of the @xmath7 so@xmath1 line and the excitation temperature of 160@xmath0k . in the following discussion , we will consider a size of 0.6@xmath5 ( 430@xmath0au ) for the hc .",
    "the derived excitation temperature from the hc@xmath2n@xmath24 transitions is unlikely affected by optical depth effects since the observed lines are weaker than those expected from a source of 0.6@xmath5 and optically thick emission with an excitation temperature of 160 k.    combining the column density derived from the pdbi data of the @xmath7 so@xmath1 line ( see table 1 ) with the estimated source size of 0.6@xmath5 and the excitation temperature of 160 k , we derive a total so@xmath1 column density for the hc of @xmath410@xmath8@xmath0@xmath9 .",
    "although the h@xmath27 column density of the hc is unknown , it can be constrained between @xmath29 and @xmath30@xmath9 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath30@xmath9 is derived from our 3@xmath0 mm continuum intensity of 30@xmath0mjy measured at the location of the hc , and by assuming that it arises from dust at a temperature of 160@xmath0k .",
    "the lower limit is obtained by assuming the extreme case that 50% of the cosmic sulfur abundance is in so@xmath1 .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , the h@xmath1 densities in the hc range between 10@xmath12 and 6@xmath610@xmath31@xmath0@xmath13 .",
    "hereafter ( see tab.@xmath02 ) , we will consider the intermediate case for a h@xmath1 column density of 10@xmath11@xmath0@xmath9 ( i.e. a so@xmath1 abundance of 10@xmath32 ) . in this case",
    ", the h@xmath1 density and the mass of the hc will be @xmath410@xmath31@xmath0@xmath13 and 4@xmath610@xmath33m@xmath34 respectively .",
    "the kinetic temperature , ( t@xmath35 ) , of the hc is unknown , but it must be equal or larger than the derived excitation temperature of 160 k. for the high density ( @xmath3610@xmath37@xmath0@xmath13 ) derived for the hc , the so@xmath1 transitions are thermalized and the excitation temperature should be a direct measurement of the kinetic temperature . furthermore the dust and gas must be also closely coupled and the dust temperature should be equal to the gas kinetic temperature . since the hc is optically thick in the mid  ir , we estimate a bolometric luminosity of @xmath410@xmath15@xmath0l@xmath16 by assuming that it emits like a black body at 160@xmath0k .    in summary",
    ", we have detected a warm ( 160@xmath0k ) , very dense ( @xmath3610@xmath12@xmath0@xmath13 ) and compact condensation ( size @xmath4400@xmath0au ) located 300@xmath0au east from the radio ",
    "the hc has a total mass of 4@xmath610@xmath33@xmath0m@xmath16 , a luminosity of @xmath410@xmath15@xmath0l@xmath16 and a very large abundance ( @xmath182@xmath610@xmath14 ) of so@xmath1 .",
    "in view of the complexity of the region in the vicinity of hw2 , we discuss the two most likely possibilities for the nature of the hc .",
    "the first one consists of a hot and dense spot in the expected circumstellar disk around the radio  jet . in the disk scenario ,",
    "the large h@xmath1 column density ( 10@xmath11@xmath0@xmath9 ) of hot gas ( 160@xmath0k ) in the hc could be externally heated by the ir radiation from hw2 or by the shocks produced by the stellar wind of hw2 .",
    "for the projected distance between hw2 and the hc , external heating by radiation would require the ir luminosity of hw2 to be few 10@xmath38@xmath0l@xmath34 ( fig.@xmath07 of kaufman , hollenbach , & tielens 1998 ) , which is at least one order of magnitude larger than that measured in the whole region of 2@xmath610@xmath20@xmath0l@xmath34 .",
    "shock heating would require collisional excitation of the v@xmath39=1 and 2 vibrationally levels of hc@xmath40n and the conversion of 10% of the total bolometric luminosity in the region into mechanical luminosity .",
    "collisional excitation of the vibrational levels of hc@xmath40n is possible since the h@xmath1 densities estimated for the hc are close to the critical densities of 2@xmath610@xmath31@xmath0@xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "shocks should then provide a mechanical luminosity of 10@xmath15l@xmath34 in a region of only 400@xmath0au .",
    "this is very unlikely since the total mechanical luminosity in the large scale outflow powered by hw2 is only 30@xmath0l@xmath34 ( @xcite ) , nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the mechanical luminosity required to heat the hc .",
    "the second possibility is that we are observing a hot core internally heated .",
    "this option will explain the presence of the vibrationally excited emission which in hot cores is usually produced by ir radiation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the luminosity and the mass of the hot core in hw2 will be more than one order of magnitude smaller than those reported for hot cores associated with massive stars",
    ". then , the hc will be the first hot core associated with an intermediate mass star .",
    "the luminosity of the hot core would require a main sequence b5 star .",
    "large so@xmath1 abundance ( @xmath410@xmath14 ) seems to be a general property of hot cores associated with massive protostars ( @xcite ) .",
    "our lower limit to the so@xmath1 abundance of 2@xmath610@xmath14 suggests that intermediate mass hot cores have similar sulfur chemistry than those associated with massive protostars .",
    "the derived hc@xmath2n abundance in the hc of @xmath410@xmath41 , is also in agreement with the abundances measured in hot cores associated with massive stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the large abundance of sulfur  bearing molecules can be driven by fast gas phase reactions after the evaporation from grain mantles of key molecules like h@xmath1s ( @xcite ) , ocs ( @xcite ) and so ( @xcite ) or atomic sulfur ( @xcite ) . from the available data on other sulfur",
    " bearing molecules , so@xmath27 seems to be the most abundant species in the hc .",
    "we can set upper limits to the abundance of other sulfur  bearing molecules and of atomic sulfur by assuming that all their emissions observed with beams of 1030@xmath5 , are optically thin and arise from the hot core . from the h@xmath1s , so and [ s@xmath0i]@xmath025.2@xmath42 m observations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively , we derive column densities for the three species of 12@xmath610@xmath43@xmath9 .",
    "their corresponding abundances are @xmath1710@xmath41 , at least one order of magnitude smaller than the so@xmath1 abundance . @xcite",
    "have performed model calculations to follow the sulfur chemistry evolution from the collapse phase to the hot core stage using new experimental data on desorption temperatures for mixed ices .",
    "the model predicts that an intermediate mass star of 5@xmath0m@xmath34 in the hot core phase will evaporate h@xmath1s from the grain mantles , and after few 10@xmath44 years , will produce so@xmath1 in gas phase with abundances similar to that observed in the intermediate mass hot core in hw2 .",
    "the discovery reported in this letter of an intermediate mass protostar , and the recent detection of two embedded young stellar objects ( @xcite ) within 500@xmath0au of hw2 , support the scenario of the formation of a cluster of stars .",
    "the new protostar in the hw2 region is an excellent candidate for powering one of the three molecular outflows observed in the region ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the relationship found between the mechanical luminosity of the molecular outflows and the luminosity of their exciting sources ( @xcite ) holds for the outflows in the cepa region , the new protostar will be luminous enough to power the east outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , high angular resolution observations of these outflows are needed to confirm if the new protostar is the driving source of one of the multiple outflows found in this region .    in summary , we have detected a hot and dense condensation in the vicinity of the radio ",
    "jet hw2 in the cepa region . from the properties of the hot condensation",
