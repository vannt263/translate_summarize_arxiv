    "the lattice depths @xmath12 and @xmath13 are individually calibrated via modulation of the respective lattice depth .",
    "this induces a population transfer from the ground to the second excited band , which can be probed via band mapping . for the red lattice , we perform the calibration in the deep lattice regime , where the bands are essentially flat , and the resonance frequency is well defined . for the green lattice , we do not reach this regime due to limited available laser power and hence the inter - band transfer for a given modulation frequency depends on the momentum within the band .",
    "we therefore fit the momentum - resolved resonance frequency distribution @xcite with the theoretical result derived from a band - structure calculation .",
    "the uncertainty of our calibration is 2% for the red lattice and 8% for the green lattice .    unlike in the bosonic case @xcite , for fermions the detuning that corresponds to a symmetric double well",

    "the measurement sequence is completed by an adiabatic ramp down of the red lattice in 6ms ( band - mapping ) in order to allow for a detection of the band populations and hence the ( trap - averaged ) populations of the even and odd lattice wells .",

    "<S> the oscillating features along the direction of the superlattice are due to the initial preparation . </S>",

    "<S> the black dashed line shows the predicted bloch period @xmath63 . ]    to summarize , we have observed that after a rapid quench of the double - well potential , local relaxation towards the balanced situation occurs which corresponds to the expected balanced equilibrium situation . </S>",
    "<S> this local relaxation already occurs in a simple integrable model with infinitely many conserved quantities by a dephasing and the relaxation time - scale is shortened by the presence of a trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> the integrability shows up in our theoretical results as a strongly non - thermal distribution of the density on length - scales of the cloud on long time scales .    in a second experimental sequence </S>",
    "<S> the global relaxation dynamics to a non - equilibrium state and its dependence on quenches to different final values are investigated in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> for this we perform a slow quench of the superlattice ( after a similar initial preparation ) by ramping down the red lattice @xmath13 over the time scale @xmath64ms to various final lattice depths @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics resulting from the slow ramp - down consists of a fast local dynamics , which typically leads to a decrease of the local particle imbalance ( as discussed in detail for the rapid quench ) , and a slower global dynamics which acts to redistribute the overall density profile . the density profile prepared before the quench is typically broader than the corresponding ground state distribution , since only every second lattice well is populated . </S>",
    "<S> choosing different final depths @xmath65 of the red lattice dictates the magnitude of the small energy offset between neighbouring wells and hence gives us control over the tunnelling dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the time evolution of the global relaxation by detecting the quasimomentum distribution with adiabatic band mapping @xcite of the green lattice ( 2ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the band - mapping technique projects the state onto the occupation of the quasi - momentum states of the homogeneous ( untrapped ) system . in the absence of a harmonic trap , </S>",
    "<S> the quasimomentum distribution should remain stationary after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of the harmonic trap couples different quasi - momentum states and thus the probe is largely insensitive to the local tunneling dynamics , but instead probes global scales . in the theoretical simulations we obtain the quasi - momentum distribution by direct projection onto the homogeneous quasi - momenta .    the evolution of the experimental and theoretical quasimomentum occupation is shown in fig .  3 for final lattice depths @xmath66 ( fig </S>",
    "<S> 3 a , b ) and @xmath67 ( fig . 3 c , d ) . in the green lattice alone without an offset between neighbouring wells @xmath68 we initially observe only quasi - momentum states occupied in half of the first brillouin zone of the green lattice , i.e. ,  the quasimomentum states @xmath69 . owing to the effects of the harmonic trap , </S>",
    "<S> the quasimomentum distribution expands quickly @xmath70ms ) into the second region ( @xmath71 ) of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see later , this is mainly due to the redistribution of atoms in the central region of the trap . after a timescale of approximately @xmath72ms ( roughly half the dipole trap frequency ) , the brillouin zone up to @xmath73 is occupied and for longer times , a fishbone - like structure emerges on the timescale of the trapping period , hints of which are visible in the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is caused by a breathing mode induced by the lattice ramp which has approximately the expected period of @xmath74ms ( related to the rescaled trap frequency @xmath75 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for a final red lattice depth of @xmath76 , the homogeneous lattice exhibits a small bandgap at the wave vector corresponding to half the green brillouin zone with a magnitude of @xmath77 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this band gap acts to protect the occupation of the quasimomentum states in the range @xmath78 . in the presence of the harmonic trapping potential , </S>",
    "<S> the global band gap is destroyed and therefore an occupation of excited quasimomentum states @xmath79 sets in . however , compared to the gapless case @xmath66 , the transfer of atoms is still strongly suppressed and as a result the occupation of quasimomentum states with @xmath80 is reduced ( see fig </S>",

    "<S> the time - axis of the theoretical result at @xmath66 is rescaled by a factor 0.87 in order to better match the experimentally observed features . </S>",
    "<S> this factor can stem from the uncertainty of the experimental parameters . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ]    in order to quantify the dynamics for different final lattice depths , we define a contrast within the brillouin zone @xmath83 . in figure 3e - f , we show the time evolution for various values of @xmath65 for a fixed phase offset @xmath84 . for zero red lattice depth , we observe a strongly damped oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> this oscillation stems from a breathing mode excited by the global non - equilibrium distribution and results in the fishbone - like structure seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 a , b . for non - vanishing final lattice depth the resulting asymmetry in the bias of even and odd sites ( and the resulting local gap ) increasingly prohibits the redistribution of quasimomenta until the quasimomentum distribution becomes frozen for @xmath85 .    . </S>",

    "<S> 4b the theoretical density profiles just before he quench for @xmath66 , and for long times ( stationary situation ) are shown to yield further spatial information . in the initial density profiles before the quench </S>",
    "<S> , the strong imbalance of the occupation between even and odd sites is shown . during the slow ramp down </S>",
    "<S> this observed density imbalance is reduced and in the following time evolution this local imbalance oscillates and decays to zero , so that locally we obtain an equilibrated density . </S>",
    "<S> the global stationary profile , in contrast , can be decomposed into two superimposed shapes which reflects the non - equilibrium nature of the state . in the center </S>",
    "<S> the density profile resembles the stationary state after an _ adiabatic _ quench , whereas at the boundaries the distribution resembles the stationary state after a _ sudden _ quench . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly signals that the boundary regions do not relax . for non - zero final red lattice depths the relaxation dynamics </S>",
    "<S> is much less pronounced due to the existence of the local gap . </S>",
    "<S> even the local occupation imbalance freezes to a larger stationary value than expected for the corresponding adiabatic or equilibrium states .    to summarize , in this work we have investigated the relaxation dynamics of non - interacting fermions after different quenches of a one - dimensional superlattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that in this integrable system , for some quenches , a relaxation towards a state , which locally resembles an equilibrium state , occurs . however , the global density distribution signals the strongly non - equilibrium nature of the situation . in the future </S>",
    "<S> an investigation of the influence of interaction on relaxation processes would be of interest . </S>",
