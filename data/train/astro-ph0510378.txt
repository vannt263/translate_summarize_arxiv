    "<S> the discovery of the highly relativistic neutron star ( ns ) binary ( in which both ns s are pulsars ) not only increases the estimated merging rate for the two ns s by a large factor , but also adds the missing link in the double helium star model of binary ns evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this model gives @xmath0 times more gravitational merging of low - mass black - hole ( lmbh ) , ns binaries than binary ns s , whatever the rate for the latter is .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of burgay et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of the double pulsar psr j0737@xmath13039a and psr j0737@xmath13039b @xcite is very interesting for many reasons . </S>",
    "<S> one that is not so obvious is that it involves just about the lowest possible mass main sequence giants as progenitors , which have not been encountered in the evolution of the other binary ns s , even though there are 20 to 30 times more of them , as we show below .    </S>",
    "<S> the observational evidence is strong that ns binaries evolve from double helium stars , avoiding the common envelope evolution of the standard scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( a helium star results in a giant when the hydrogen envelope is lifted off - in binary evolution by being transferred to the less massive giant in the binary . ) in the standard scenario of binary ns formation after the more massive giant transfers its hydrogen envelope to the companion giant , the remaining helium star burns and then explodes into a ns . in about half the cases the binary is not disrupted in the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the ns waits until the remaining giant evolves ( and expands ) in red giant following its main sequence hydrogen burning . </S>",
    "<S> once the envelope is close enough to the ns , the latter couples to it hydrodynamically through gravity . in the system in which the ns is at rest , it sees the envelope matter coming at it . </S>",
    "<S> some of it is accreted onto the ns , although most flies by in the wake , being heated in the process , and is lost into space . </S>",
    "<S> the energy to expel the matter comes from the drop in potential energy as the orbit of the ns tightens . </S>",
    "<S> formulas for the tightening and the amount of mass accreted by the ns were given by bethe & brown @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> chevalier @xcite first estimated that in the common envelope evolution the ns would accrete sufficient matter to evolve into a black hole ( bh ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was made quantitative by bethe & brown @xcite who calculated that in a typical case , the ns would accrete @xmath2 , taking it into an @xmath3 low mass black hole ( lmbh ) , similar to the bh we believe resulted from sn1987a .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the ns had to go through common envelope evolution in a hydrogen envelope of @xmath4 from the giant , it would accrete sufficient matter to go into a lmbh . therefore , when the giant evolved into a helium star , which later exploded into a ns , a lmbh - ns binary would result provided the system was not broken up in the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> ( about 50% of the time the system survives the explosion . ) </S>",
    "<S> the above scenario was estimated @xcite to take place 10 times more frequently than binary ns formation which required the two stars to burn helium at the same time , and , because of the greater mass of the bh , the mergings of binaries with lmbh to be twice as likely to be seen as those with only ns s . </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of the factor 20 enhancement of gravitational mergers to be observed at ligo , over the number from binary ns s alone .    </S>",
    "<S> we review the known ns binaries and show that they are consistent with the two ns s in a given binary having very nearly the same mass , as would follow from the double helium star scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> .5 observed neutron star binaries with measured masses . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we list in table  [ tab1 ] the 5 observed ns binaries with measured masses . </S>",
    "<S> the very nearly equal masses of pulsar and companion in 1534@xmath512 and 2127@xmath511c is remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> we show below that 1913@xmath516 comes from a region of giant progenitors in which the masses could easily be as different as they are . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties in 1518@xmath549 are great enough that the masses could well be equal . </S>",
    "<S> the main point in our letter is to show that the masses in the double pulsar j0737@xmath13039a and j0737@xmath13039b were probably very nearly the same before a common envelope evolution in which the first formed ns j0737@xmath13039a accreted matter from the evolving ( expanding ) helium star progenitor of j0737@xmath13039b in the scenario of dewi & van den heuvel @xcite .    since the helium burning in the giant is an order of magnitude shorter than the hydrogen burning in time , for two giants to burn helium at the same time they have to be very nearly equal in mass , within @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the binary neutron star scenario is highly selective . </S>",
    "<S> if they do burn helium at the same time , they can go through common envelope evolution at this time . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen envelope of the slightly more massive giant expands in red giant and is transferred to the less massive giant , which in turn evolves in red giant . </S>",
    "<S> the time for these evolutions is so short that the helium stars are unable to accept the hydrogen which is lost into space @xcite so that the final neutron stars are also close in mass . </S>",
    "<S> each of the helium stars will explode , going into a ns . in about half of each explosion the binary </S>",
    "<S> is disrupted , but in about 1/4 of the cases it is preserved and a double neutron star results .    </S>",
    "<S> bethe & pizzochero @xcite used for sn 1987a a schematic but realistic treatment of the radiative transfer problem which allowed them to follow the position in mass of the photosphere as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that the observations determine uniquely the kinetic energy of the envelope once the mass is known . from the envelope masses </S>",
    "<S> considered , the range of energies was 1 to @xmath7 ergs . </S>",
    "<S> using the fact that the pressure following the supernova shock is radiation dominated , bethe & brown @xcite showed from the known value of @xmath8 of @xmath9ni production , an upper limit on the gravitational mass of @xmath10 could be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the calculated fe core mass for the known @xmath11 progenitor of 1987a .    </S>",
    "<S> calculations of woosley are shown in table  3 of brown et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the amounts of fallback material from distance of 3500 km and 4500 km are given . </S>",
    "<S> the fallback simply cancels the gravitational binding energy from the fe core evolving into a ns . </S>",
    "<S> since the density of matter is thin at the estimated 4000 km bifuraction point , this cancellation is relatively insensitive to the precise point of bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can use the fe core mass as the mass of the ns .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we show both recent and older calculations of fe core masses . </S>",
    "<S> the filled circles and crosses correspond to core masses at the time of iron core implosion for a finely spaced grid of stellar masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the circles were calculated with the woosley & weaver code @xcite , whereas the crosses employ the vastly improved rates for electron capture and beta decay @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a rapid increase in fe core masses occurs at @xmath12 , just the mass of the progenitor of 1987a which we believe went into a lmbh . </S>",
    "<S> the burrows & woosley @xcite evolution of 1913@xmath516 took place in terms of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in this evolution the fe core mass will be slightly less than given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] because the mass transfer in binary evolution removes the hydrogen envelope , leaving a  naked \" helium star . </S>",
    "<S> the wind loss from naked helium stars is great . ) </S>",
    "<S> now one can see that the difference in masses between , 19 and @xmath14 giants is greater than @xmath15 , so that the @xmath16 difference in masses between the pulsar and its companion in 1913@xmath516 can easily be furnished out of the calculated fe core masses .    </S>",
    "<S> there is some tendency for the fe core masses to decrease from @xmath17 of 15 to @xmath18 , where we would estimate 1534@xmath512 and its companion to come from . </S>",
    "<S> ( the companion is slightly more massive than the pulsar . )    </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar and companion in the double pulsar should come from @xmath19 , at the @xmath20 of the present j0737@xmath13039a . following dewi & van den heuvel @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the first pulsar formed is increased in mass with mass transfer from the companion when the latter is a helium star . </S>",
    "<S> low - mass helium stars , 2.3 to @xmath21 have to burn hotter than higher mass ones because of the greater energy loss from their surfaces . in reaction to this , they expand in a helium red giant phase . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar now goes through a common envelope stage with the envelope of the helium star once the latter expands far enough to make contact .    </S>",
    "<S> as noted , the ns accretes some of the matter and most is expelled in the wake . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from the coefficient of dynamical friction @xmath22 @xcite , it is found @xcite that =( ) ^1/5 . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq1 ] we take @xmath23 and @xmath24 . now </S>",
    "<S> the orbit in the double pulsar is decreased a factor of @xmath25 from that of the binary ns . </S>",
    "<S> ( the average of periods of 1913@xmath516 and 1534@xmath512 is @xmath26 days , whereas that of the double pulsar is 0.1 day . ) </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 exponent is the kepler relation between orbital period and radius , and we then find = 1.075 which gives the correct @xmath28 for j0737@xmath13039b given @xmath29 , the same as the unrecycled neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath30 he star will burn into the unrecycled pulsar , with mass decreased @xmath31 by the general relativity binding energy .    therefore , in the double pulsar , the masses of the two giant progenitors must be very close , since the two ns s would have had nearly equal masses ( as in 1534@xmath512 ) , except for the mass transfer during the helium red giant stage .    </S>",
    "<S> the salpeter mass distribution of giants gives the relative number proportional to @xmath32 , so for two equal mass giants , the distribution goes as @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the probability of two @xmath34 giants is 26 times greater than that of two @xmath14 giants , as would be progenitors of 1913@xmath516 . </S>",
    "<S> burgay et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite estimated the ratio @xmath35 to peak at @xmath36 , whereas dewi & van den heuvel @xcite estimate that there are many of the psr j0739-like systems not seen because of their weak signals compared with those from 1913@xmath516 , possibly giving a factor @xmath37 in mergings . our estimate based on </S>",
    "<S> the large number of low - mass giant progenitors confirms this .    with @xmath4 hydrogen envelopes and a proportional tightening of the orbit in the common envelope evolution in the standard scenario , the bethe & brown result of accretion of @xmath2 onto the first ns seems reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> after only part of this is accreted , the neutron star , like in 1987a , goes into a black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> why havent we seen any lmbh - ns binaries ? </S>",
    "<S> van den heuvel @xcite has pointed out that ns s form with strong magnetic fields @xmath38 to @xmath39 gauss , and spin down in a time _ </S>",
    "<S> sd ~510 ^ 6 and then disappear into the graveyard of ns s . </S>",
    "<S> ( the pulsation mechanism requires a minimum voltage from the polar cap , which can be obtained from @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 in seconds @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic binary psr 1913@xmath516 has a weaker field @xmath43 gauss and therefore emits less energy in magnetic dipole radiation . </S>",
    "<S> van den heuvel estimates its spin - down time as @xmath44 yrs . </S>",
    "<S> there is thus a premium in observational time for lower magnetic fields , in that the pulsars can be seen for longer times .    </S>",
    "<S> taam and van den heuvel @xcite found empirically that the magnetic field of a pulsar dropped roughly linearly with accreted mass . </S>",
    "<S> this accretion can take place from the companion in any stage of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> a pulsar that has undergone accretion is said to have been  recycled \" .    </S>",
    "<S> now as mentioned , in 1913@xmath516 the pulsar magnetic field is @xmath45 gauss and in 1534@xmath512 it is @xmath46 gauss . in j0737@xmath13039a </S>",
    "<S> it is only @xmath47 gauss . </S>",
    "<S> these  recycled pulsars \" will be observable for @xmath48 times longer than a  fresh \" ( unrecycled ) pulsar .    </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for lmbh - ns binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the ns is certainly not recycled , so there is an about 1% chance of seeing one as the recycled pulsar in a binary ns . </S>",
    "<S> but we propose 10 times more of the lmbh s than binary ns s , of which we observe 5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total probability of seeing the lmbh binary should be about 50% . </S>",
    "<S> however , there may be additional reasons that the lmbh - ns binary is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> ns s in binaries in which the nature of the companion star is unknown are observed . </S>",
    "<S> we may have to wait for ligo which will be able to measure  chirp \" masses quite accurately . </S>",
    "<S> the chirp mass of a ns binary should concentrate near @xmath49 , whereas the lmbh - ns systems should have a chirp mass of @xmath50 , and there should be @xmath0 times more of the latter .    in order to estimate the number of mergings per year for the ligo we begin from the estimate of kim et al . @xcite and multiply by a factor of 26 to account for the increase in this estimate by the large number of low - mass giant progenitors , neutron stars from two of these having been observed in the double pulsar . additionally we multiply by the factor of 20 to include ns - lmbh binary mergings . </S>",
    "<S> this brings our estimate up to 0.5 to 3.6 mergings per year for the initial ligo , and about 6000 times greater for the advanced ligo .    </S>",
