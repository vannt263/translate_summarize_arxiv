    "the evolution of the structural properties of massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) is currently a topic of debate with many open questions . in recent years",
    ", studies have shown that galaxies with @xmath9 are smaller by a factor of four at @xmath10 @xcite and a factor of two at @xmath11 @xcite than the nearby population of the same mass .",
    "for the most compact and massive galaxies in particular , @xcite found that only @xmath50.03% of sdss galaxies with @xmath12 at @xmath13 are etgs with @xmath14 kpc .",
    "this contrasts with the much higher fraction @xmath515% of such galaxies found at @xmath15@xmath51 by trujillo et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter t07 ) .",
    "most interestingly , the luminosity - weighted ages of the local compact etgs from @xcite are very low ( @xmath52 gyr ) , which argues against this sample being the counterpart of a passively evolved population of high redshift galaxies .",
    "thus , this suggests that most high redshift compact and massive galaxies must have undergone a systematic growth in size .",
    "+ among the different mechanisms proposed to explain this expansion , the one that reproduces best the observed evolution of the average mass - size relation @xcite is the minor merger scenario @xcite . with this mechanism , galaxies grow inside - out by accretion of smaller satellites that build up an extended envelope @xcite . this model predicts a substantial growth in mass and effective radius , with a mild decrease in stellar velocity dispersion @xmath16 .",
    "thus , measurements of @xmath16 at different redshifts are a direct way to constrain this evolutionary scenario . in addition , they allow for an independent mass estimate through the virial theorem . + the minor merger scenario is consistent with the common findings of @xmath17 @xmath4for general etg samples at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "conversely , it is greatly challenged by the dramatic evolution required for the super - dense galaxies ( @xmath19 kpc , @xmath20 ) , which are expected to have much larger @xmath16 . @xcite measured @xmath21 @xmath4from a super - dense etg at @xmath22 , yielding a dynamical mass that is in agreement with the photometric mass estimate . however ,",
    "more @xmath16 measurements of these extreme galaxies are needed to support or weaken the need of a stronger evolutionary scenario . in this paper",

    "our targets were selected from the sample by t07 , which contains photometrically derived parameters for 831 galaxies with @xmath36 up to @xmath37 in the egs field from the powir / deep-2 survey @xcite .",
    "those authors measured effective radii with the galfit code @xcite and derived total stellar masses by fitting spectral energy distributions from @xcite with chabrier imf on @xmath6 photometry .",
    "we selected four massive and compact etgs at @xmath0 with srsic index @xmath38 .",
    "three of them have extreme densities in the sense that they are the most compact at a given mass .",
    "the catalog parameters of our selection are displayed in the first five columns of table 1 .",
    "we observed 2 galaxies at a time using optical long - slit spectroscopy with the osiris camera - spectrograph @xcite at the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias .",

    "the total integration time per target was 12800 s. the instrumental resolution was determined by gaussian fitting of the strong sky emission lines yielding @xmath41 @xmath4 .",
    "however , in one of the observing nights the spectrograph suffered a defocus that decreased the resolution , affecting half of the exposures of 12019899 and 12024453 . for these frames we found @xmath42 @xmath4 , and we reduced this data subset independently .",
    "the standard star l970 - 30 was also observed to flux calibrate the spectra .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the iraf longslit package and involved the standard steps of bias level correction , spectral flat - fielding , cosmic ray removal , sky subtraction , frame co - adding and aperture extraction .",
    "the telluric absorption band around 7600   was present in all of our spectra , affecting the ca h+k lines in targets 12019899 and 12024321 . to correct for telluric absorption in these two galaxies",
    ", we used a f - type star observed in the same slit as 12019899 .",
    "this star s spectrum has a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath43 and a smooth continuum with no spectral features within the telluric band .",
    "after its continuum removal and normalization we obtained the atmospheric transmission profile in the spectral window and divided the galaxy spectra with affected ca h+k lines by this transmission profile .",
    "we did not apply the telluric band correction on the other targets because the main spectral lines used to measure @xmath16 were not affected in them .",
    "note that this correction increases the noise in the spectral window where it is applied .",
    "thus , in these cases the correction did not contribute towards more precise @xmath16 measurements and for this reason we simply excluded the affected range in wavelength from the analysis .",

    "the age and metallicity of each galaxy were determined from the values of the ssp model with the largest coefficient in the linear combination that best fitted the galaxy spectrum ( see values in table 1 ) .",
    "these values show relatively low ages in the range of @xmath56 gyr , with uncertainties estimated to be around 0.4 gyr .",
    "in addition , we calculated photometric stellar masses using the data from the rainbow database @xcite , which includes photometry for our galaxies in @xmath530 bands covering a range from 150 nm up to 70 @xmath57 m .",
    "we fit these data to stellar population models by @xcite with chabrier imf , assuming an extinction law from @xcite .",
    "we constrain the metallicity in the same way than for the movel templates .",

    "such outcome is very similar to the results from movel .",
    "+ the galaxies 12024790 and 12024321 have [ oii]@xmath583727   emission , implying ongoing or recent star formation .",

    ", the galaxy 12024790 shows a double peak in the [ oii ] emission .",

    "it has been found that @xmath62 is robust against rotation up to @xmath67 @xcite , and there is no clear evidence that this would be different at @xmath68 @xcite .",

    "+ our galaxies have values that are systematically smaller than the originally published stellar masses by an average factor of @xmath56 .",

    "we found no significant difference between our uv - fir and @xmath6 masses , implying that the discrepancy with t07 can not be simply explained by the use of a different spectral range .",

    "they find that , on average , their masses are consistent with those from t07 .",
    "therefore , the cause of the inconsistency with our photometric masses is unclear . given the large uncertainties in the systematics of photometric masses , we adopt dynamical masses as the correct total mass estimates .",

    "+ comparison studies between stellar and dynamical mass of less dense etgs than those in our sample have been conducted at low @xcite and high redshifts @xcite with the result of dynamical masses being on average equal or larger than stellar masses , as expected when considering a dark matter contribution .",
    "when @xcite calculate stellar masses using similar multi - band photometry and stellar population parameters as in t07 , they find @xmath72 ( salpeter imf ) .",
    "therefore , our results point towards a systematic overestimation of the stellar masses used to select the galaxies of our sample .",
    "we can not rule out a deviation from homology that requires @xmath73 .",
    "however , the theoretical expectation for objects with such high srsic index is @xmath74 @xcite , which would yield even smaller dynamical masses .",

    "compared to the fp derived by these authors , at a given @xmath75 our field sample shows a similar slope and a relative offset of @xmath78 mag towards brighter @xmath79 , which is in agreement with field galaxies having generally younger stellar populations than clusters of the same redshift .",
    "+ in order to understand how our galaxies relate to low redshift etgs , we investigate the simple evolutionary scenario based on passive luminosity fading of the stellar populations and growth via minor mergers that has been proposed for the general population of etgs at @xmath80 @xcite . to derive the amount of fading for our sample , we use @xcite models with chabrier imf and the redshift , ages and metallicities from table [ table1 ] .",
