    "phase averaging over a long period of time is not the optimal phase estimation in both simulation and measurement although the results are consistent with each other @xcite .",
    "the study of @xcite included phase estimation using a simple 5- or 7-tap averaging filter , far shorter than the equivalent averaging filter of @xcite .",
    "the group of @xcite may be the first one to contribute to the idea that carrier phase estimation may reduce the xpm - induced nonlinear phase noise using joint polarization phase estimation .",
