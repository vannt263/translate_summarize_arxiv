    "the behaviour of the cell membrane is crucially important to a wide variety of processes in biology  @xcite . however , since the underlying construction of almost all biological membranes is that of an amphiphilic bilayer , much of the physics literature has so far focused on understanding simple bilayers and their closed - form counterparts , vesicles  @xcite . despite intensive research over the last 50 years",
    ", such approaches have failed to properly describe the role of the biological membranes in commonly observed phenomena , such as cell locomotion for example .",
    "the point is that often the nonamphiphilic component of the membrane is important ( in the case of cell locomotion , consider so - called membrane - to - cortex attachment proteins embedded in the bilayer ) . in this paper",
    "we attempt a consistent dynamical treatment of such multicomponent membranes , which makes quantitative predictions about the dynamical relationship between curvature and the diffusion of amphiphiles relative to non - amphiphiles .",
    "the hope is that such ideas might act as a base onto which successful predictive models of the above phenomena can be built , and more .",
    "the modern quantitative description of bilayers was pioneered by helfrich  @xcite in the 1970s ( and independently by canham  @xcite and evans  @xcite ) and has not advanced greatly since .",
    "drawing parallels between the amphiphiles of a bilayer and the rodlike molecules of nematic liquid crystals , helfrich adapted expressions for the frank free energy  @xcite by replacing the director with the normal to the membrane surface .",
    "the result was a local free energy per unit area of the form @xmath0 in the normal way , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are just the mean and gaussian curvatures respectively  @xcite , and @xmath3 the spontaneous curvature is a constant . the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 are called the bending rigidity and elastic modulus of gaussian curvature , respectively , and are also constant .    strictly , eq .  ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) describes the free energy of a monolayer rather than a bilayer , and therefore a number of attempts at improvement",
    "have been made ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the similarity between monolayers with different head - tail interactions and bilayers with differing leaf densities , both the original model and its relatives have been used extensively in the physics literature  @xcite , most notably in the static description of vesicles under constraint  @xcite .",
    "only recently have attempts been made to write nonequilibrium descriptions of membrane dynamics , but so far the focus has been solely on vesicles  @xcite .",
    "taking inspiration from such studies , this article goes back to the original model of helfrich and demonstrates that it can be extended by analogy with nematohydrodynamics in the linear regime .",
    "as we show , such an approach permits the incorporation of additional nonamphiphilic components and leads to a membrane description in terms of both curvature and in - membrane molecular flows .",
    "the starting point is to make two important observations .",
    "first , biological membranes are made not only from amphiphiles , but from a whole host of other nonamphiphilic molecules ( cholesterol , carbohydrates , proteins , protein channels , fat - soluble molecules _ etc .",
    "second , in most biological systems the temperature is sufficiently high that the molecules in the membrane effectively form a two - dimensional fluid which , when close to equilibrium , can be described by linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( lnet )  @xcite . in this framework , the geometry of the problem then enters through the gibbs free energy , so it is important to ensure a consistent thermodynamic formulation .",
    "recall then that lnet assumes a _ local _ equilibrium , such that the gibbs relation @xmath6 is obeyed at every point in space and time . here @xmath7 is temperature , @xmath8 is pressure , and , following the literature , we use @xmath9 , the specific entropy , given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the usual entropy and @xmath12 is mass .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 is specific internal energy , @xmath14 is the specific volume , and @xmath15 is the specific gibbs energy . for clarity ,",
    "subscripted brackets , @xmath16 , are used to indicate that both temperature and pressure are held constant .",
    "we imagine a membrane as a two - dimensional fluid only one molecule thick .",
    "the fluid is an incompressible mixture of rodlike amphiphiles ( henceforth referred to simply as lipids ) and pointlike `` other '' molecules .",
    "the other molecules are pointlike in the sense that they have no orientation , or , more specifically , we associate with them no energy contribution that is a function of the membrane shape .",
    "( they are still assumed to have mass and to occupy volume in the normal way ) . for simplicity , we take a highly idealised approach and assume that all such pointlike molecules are thermodynamically equivalent ( though it should be noted that a full multi - component treatment is still possible , if tedious ) . in this simplified case ,",
    "the specific gibbs energy is just @xmath17 where , in the first term , the concentration and chemical potential of component @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for `` lipids '' , and @xmath23 for `` other '' ) .",
    "if the nonamphiphilic molecules were known , then the subscript would simply label them , in turn , @xmath24 .",
    "the second term in ( [ eq : g^nem ] ) is the energy associated with the nematic nature of the lipid molecules , which can be approximated by an elastic description  @xcite of the chemical interactions between the head groups and between the tails groups of the lipid molecules .",
    "the rest of this section briefly reviews such a theory ( and its assumptions ) in order to highlight certain important caveats that arise due to our description being both dynamical and multicomponent .",
    "the benefits of an elastic theory are twofold .",
    "first , the system can be written formally in terms of a single well - defined `` neutral - torque '' surface @xmath25 , using a standard procedure .",
    "second , it provides a description for the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 in terms of geometrical variables , allowing the assumptions of this approach to be made plain .",
    "the standard route is to write @xmath26 as a sum of two quadratic terms : @xmath27 where subscripts are used to indicate either head or tail groups .",
    "for example , @xmath28 is the area per unit mass on a surface defined to intersect the head groups of all the molecules , while @xmath29 is defined in a similar way for the molecular tails . both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants , as are the quantities",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 , defined as the area per unit mass at equilibrium for head and tail groups respectively .",
    "the projection onto a neutral - torque surface is described in  @xcite and recapitulated ( with some small modifications ) in appendix [ app : elastic ] .",
    "the result is that , apart from a term which describes the free energy associated with a lateral tension ( which for our model is assumed constant ) eq .",
    "( [ eq : helfrich ] ) is recovered . however ,",
    "contrary to helfrich s approach , the values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 are no longer constant , and depend on @xmath34 , the local area per mass [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) to ( [ eq : kappa_g ] ) ] .",
    "this conflict has previously been resolved by the authors of  @xcite by minimising the free energy under the constraint of a fixed number of particles in the monolayer ( the result is that @xmath34 is constant up to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the length along the long axis of the lipid molecules ) . however , since our description includes the behaviour of nonamphiphilic molecules , this result can only be applied as a lowest order approximation when the concentration of nonamphiphiles is low .",
    "it is therefore important to state that , physically , we assume to always be in the regime of constant bending rigidity , when the nonamphiphilic molecules do not materially affect @xmath4 and only contribute to free energy through the first term of ( [ eq : g^nem ] ) .",
    "it is also necessary to remark on the gaussian curvature @xmath2 .",
    "while @xmath2 is routinely ignored in equilibrium studies of vesicles @xcite due to the gauss - bonnet theorem , such an approach can not be applied here as it relies on the integration of the membrane energy over a closed surface .",
    "however , progress can be made by closely following nematohydrodynamics , where a standard assumption is that the dominant contributions to the free energy of a nematic fluid come from terms proportional to the director and its first spatial derivatives @xcite . in our case , since we may identify the director with the normal @xmath37 of the surface @xmath25 , this amounts to ignoring all terms in ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) that contain higher spatial derivatives of @xmath37 . leaving the details to appendix [ app : geom ] ( geometry will also be discussed in the next section )",
    "the important point is that , alongside the standard formula @xmath38 , the gaussian curvature can be shown to be given by @xmath39 ,      \\label{eq : kofn_main}\\ ] ] which involves second spatial derivatives of @xmath37 . as a result , fully incorporating the effects of the gaussian curvature is left for further work , and in this treatment we retain only the first term of ( [ eq : kofn_main ] ) .",
    "taking the above into account , the lipid interactions only contribute to the gibbs energy via the mean curvature : @xmath40 for the purposes of thermodynamics , it is helpful to identify extensive and intensive contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g^nem_2 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "noting from ( [ eq : kappa_g ] ) that @xmath5 is linear in @xmath4 , and in order to conform with the conventions of nematohydrodynamics , we define the intensive variable @xmath41 , and the corresponding extensive variable @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the usual mass density .",
    "from here , it follows that @xmath44 which , when returning to the local equilibrium condition , gives @xmath45",
    "the usual lnet approach is to manipulate the time derivative of ( [ eq : g^nem_final ] ) through careful application of conservation laws and constitutive relations and then to compare the result with the equation for local entropy balance , @xmath46 ( here @xmath47 is the convective entropy flux , and @xmath48 is the entropy production term . ) under normal circumstances , this tactic then identifies the source term with a bilinear sum of the thermodynamic forces and fluxes , from which onsager relations can be deduced .    before proceeding however , recall that these relations are now defined on the 2d surface @xmath25 , which is assumed to be regular and parametrized by variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "any point on the surface is then defined by the position vector @xmath51 , and the tangent space at each point is spanned by the two vectors @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 and similarly for all greek indices where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "using the shorthand notation @xmath56 , the gradient operator becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the metric tensor and @xmath59 its inverse . for membranes with a finite thickness , one must typically compute corrections to diffuse processes that are caused by curvature  @xcite .",
    "however , since the monolayer is assumed to be only one molecule thick , these corrections can be ignored and most of the traditional conservation laws ( _ e.g. _ , mass and internal energy ) carry over without any modifications . for a system at constant uniform temperature ,",
    "the application of these laws ( appendix [ app : conserv ] ) gives @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the local diffusion flow , and @xmath62 is the nonhydrostatic part of the pressure tensor .",
    "( here @xmath63 are partial mass densities , and @xmath64 defines both the barycentric velocity @xmath65 , and the partial velocities @xmath66 . )",
    "the notation uses sans - serif font for a ( rank 2 ) tensor , a superscript @xmath67 to denote the transpose , and a colon to represent the trace of an interior product ; _ i.e. _ , the term @xmath68 is written in component form as @xmath69 , where a sum is implicit for repeated indices , both greek and latin . here",
    "latin indices are the usual cartesian components in three dimensions such that @xmath70 is the @xmath71-th component of the tangent vector @xmath72 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the traditional liquid crystals approach for computing the time - derivative of free energies with nematic order such as the final term in ( [ eq : dgibbs_dt_nematic_2]) is to assume a dependence on @xmath37 and its first spatial derivatives @xmath73 and then impose straightforward constitutive relations for these quantities  @xcite . for our case , since @xmath74 was constructed with these constraints in mind , the final term in ( [ eq : dgibbs_dt_nematic_2 ] ) can be computed directly from @xmath38 , although as we show , care must be taken when differentiating the gradient operator .",
    "specifically , by recalling the definition of @xmath74 , the time derivative can be written as @xmath75 here if the gradient that appears in the last term was just the usual operator ( and not restricted to the surface ) , then @xmath76 and equations similar to those that appear in the theory of nematic liquid crystals could be recovered  @xcite . in turn",
    ", this leads to terms in ( [ eq : dgibbs_dt_nematic_2 ] ) that are either convective or bilinear in forces and fluxes , which is required by lnet and therefore desirable . with this in mind , the part that is of interest in ( [ eq : time_deriv ] ) is the proper time - derivative of @xmath77 , which in component form becomes @xmath78 = &           \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d } t } \\left [               g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(r_\\alpha\\right)_i \\right]\\partial_\\beta n_j          + \\\\ & g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(r_\\alpha\\right)_i           \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d } t } \\left[\\partial_\\beta n_j\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : time_deriv_2 }      \\end{split}\\ ] ] at this stage we notice that the director @xmath37 is an average over local orientations of the amphiphilic molecules only ; therefore , we may use the material derivative @xmath79 where the velocity is that of the lipids ( amphiphiles ) . applying ( [ eq : hydro_d_dt ] ) , the last term in ( [ eq : time_deriv_2 ] ) can be expanded ( again , in component form ) to give @xmath80 = &       g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(r_\\alpha\\right)_i\\partial_\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\partial       n_j}{\\partial t}\\right ) + \\\\ &      g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(r_\\alpha\\right)_i g^{\\mu\\nu }       \\left(v_l\\right)_k\\left(r_\\mu\\right)_k\\partial_\\nu\\partial_\\beta n_j . \\end{split }      \\label{eq : expand}\\ ] ] manipulating derivatives , one can then show that the second term of ( [ eq : expand ] ) is just equivalent to @xmath81 = &      % g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(r_\\alpha\\right)_i\\partial_\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d }   % n_j}{\\mathrm{d } t}\\right ) - \\\\ &      g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(r_\\alpha\\right)_i \\partial_\\beta \\left [ g^{\\mu\\nu }       \\left(v_l\\right)_k\\left(r_\\mu\\right)_k\\right]\\partial_\\nu n_j , % \\end{split }      \\label{eq : manip}\\ ] ] which , when combined with ( [ eq : time_deriv_2 ] ) makes it clear that the condition ( [ eq : corrolary ] ) is only satisfied if @xmath82 .",
    "\\label{eq : assumption}\\ ] ] the simplest way of understanding the ramifications of this relation is to note that it causes the distortion stress to vanish ( apart from a straightforward density - dependent term ) .",
    "that is , it is implicitly assumed that there is no energy cost ( and therefore no force per unit area ) arising as a result of deformations which move the relative positions of the molecules but keep the director field fixed .",
    "mathematically , this is certainly self - consistent with a free energy that is only based on the relative orientation of the molecules , _ viz . _",
    "eq .  ( [ eq : mono_2 ] )",
    ". physically , since both the lateral tension and the bending rigidity are constant and uniform , any membrane configuration that leads to the same director field must be thermodynamically equivalent .",
    "the main corollary of ( [ eq : assumption ] ) is that it implies @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the molecular field ( constant density ) , @xmath85 is the viscous stress , and @xmath86 is a convective `` nematic flux '' term .",
    "[ we have introduced the shorthand @xmath87 , for simplicty . ] before making the comparison with ( [ eq : local_ent_bal ] ) however , a number of constraints can be implemented to make the analysis simpler .",
    "first , it is standard to separate out the temperature dependence by manipulating derivatives .",
    "second , we must recognise that the barycentric diffusion flows are not independent ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath88 .",
    "finally , since we stipulate that all molecules point normal to the surface , contributions from the antisymmetric part of @xmath89 can be neglected ( this arises from conservation of angular momentum ; see  @xcite and appendix [ app : ang_mom ] ) . with these modifications ,",
    "one may identify the entropy production term as @xmath90 where a superscript @xmath91 is used to indicate the symmetric part .",
    "it is this form that will lead to reciprocal relations of the onsager type .",
    "invoking the cure principle and only writing linear relations for forces and fluxes of the same tensorial character , we focus on the coupled vector relations , @xmath92 where the onsager coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 are labeled by subscripts `` d '' for diffusion and `` n '' for nematic .",
    "it is these linear relations that couple lipid diffusion to curvature and which contain the main result of this paper .",
    "however , the result is best cast in terms of a cross - diffusion effect such as the soret or dufour effects  @xcite . to see this",
    ", we use the gibbs - duhem relation for our system @xmath95 from here , using the fact the @xmath96 , it is clear that @xmath97 where the shorthand notation of  @xcite has been used : @xmath98 . on physical grounds , we expect that @xmath99 , that is , the rate of change of the lipid chemical potential with respect to the concentration of lipids is zero when the system can no longer accommodate any more lipids .",
    "we may also reasonably expect that @xmath100 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath101 . with these constraints in mind",
    ", we make the simplest assumption possible : that @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . substituting this result , along with ( [ eq : h_alpha ] ) , into the linear relations ( [ eq : onsager_vector ] ) and then taking the divergence on both sides of the resulting expressions gives @xmath104 where both ( [ eq : corrolary ] ) and the condition for conservation of mass , @xmath105 , have been used , and @xmath106 is the laplace - beltrami operator ( laplacian on the surface ) .",
    "the new coefficients comprise two `` direct '' terms , a diffusion coefficient , @xmath107 and a curvature relaxation coefficient , @xmath108 plus two indirect cross - terms , @xmath109 that represent molecular diffusion induced by curvature and its reciprocal effect of curvature induced by molecular diffusion , respectively .",
    "in summary , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cross_diff ] ) describe the relaxation of a two - component ( amphiphilic and nonamphiphilic ) fluid membrane towards equilibrium at constant temperature and constant lateral tension .",
    "the result was obtained by combining nematohydrodynamics and geometry under the important assumption ( [ eq : assumption ] ) , which is equivalent to the statement that @xmath110    that is , the explicit time dependence of the tangent vectors ( and their weights ) is fixed to be a function of the velocity gradients . or , more heuristically , since the lipids ( amphiphiles ) are constrained to point normal to the surface , there is no way of deforming the membrane without moving the relative positions of the amphiphiles and nonamphiphiles .",
    "the result predicts that a membrane with a curvature that has nonzero laplacian _",
    "e.g. _ , a parabolic profile will relax towards a constant - curvature surface accompanied by a simultaneous flow of lipids away from regions where the laplacian of the curvature is largest ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "indeed , the equations also predict the inverse effect : if a concentration gradient ( with nonzero divergence ) can be established in a free membrane , then it would induce a corresponding curvature .",
    "an intuitive understanding of this effect can be gained by thinking in terms of molecular splay : the degree to which the head groups of the lipids are separated with respect to their tails . in regions of high curvature ,",
    "the splay and hence the energy associated with the configuration is very high .",
    "however , since the molecules are fluid , they can address this situation by displacing nonamphiphilic molecules to increase their concentration and reduce their splay at points where the gradient of the curvature has non - zero divergence .",
    "similarly , an enforced ( zero divergence ) concentration gradient of lipids is not optimal on a constant - curvature surface due to the repulsive effect of too little splay [ recall the quadratic profile ( [ eq : mono_2 ] ) ] and hence the surface free to move adjusts its conformation accordingly .",
    "we remark that the form of diffusion coefficients ( [ eq : d_dd ] ) to ( [ eq : d_cross ] ) acts reinforce this picture .",
    "for example , if the effective bending modulus @xmath111 is increased _ i.e. _ , by using different lipids then the rate of the cross - diffusion is also increased . that is , if the membrane is stiffer , and more energy has to be added to the system to induce , say , a parabola ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) , then the rate at which lipids flow to reduce the energy of the system is increased by the same factor .",
    "such effects should , in principle , be observable by experiments that monitor single particle diffusion @xcite on a pseudo - free membrane ( very large vesicle or sheet with zero hydrostatic pressure difference ) , where numerical estimates for the diffusion constants , and hence onsager coefficients would be welcome . indeed , the broader theory predicts other cross - effects , notably in the presence of a temperature gradient , although this is considered out of the scope of this study .    finally ,",
    "while there are undoubtedly drawbacks and limitations inherent with such an approach , it is hoped that the work presented here can be adopted and extended in order to overcome any difficulties . in particular , a better understanding of the types ( and behaviour ) of nonamphiphilic molecule most prevalent in biological membranes would be helpful .",
    "armed with such information , it is plausible that this kind of model could shed light on the role of biological membranes in interesting but unexplained phenomena , such as cell locomotion .",
    "we therefore welcome further work in the area .",

    "@xcite . retaining the spirit of the original work",
    ", we present a variant of this approach and demonstrate how it should be interpreted within the context of lnet .",
    "central to the approach is the asymmetric nature of amphiphilic molecules .",
    "the principal idea is that , when close to equilibrium , the free energy of a monolayer can be modelled as two elastic sheets with different elastic moduli .",
    "the two elastic sheets approximate the different chemical interactions between the head groups and between the tail groups , of amphiphilic molecules .",
