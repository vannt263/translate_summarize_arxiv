    "the concordant @xmath0cdm paradigm ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) has been accepted as a successful framework to understand the evolution of the universe . however , in this standard model there are two unexplained dark sectors , dubbed dark matter and dark energy , still need more fundamental understandings .",
    "one of various endeavors on this explanation is the approach of modified gravity , including bekenstein s teves @xcite . unlike most theories of modified gravity that are proposed for explaining dark energy , teves was originally proposed to explain dark matter instead .",
    "indeed , teves was built up by bekenstein for a viable relativistic version of milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite .",
    "other many recent theories which recovers mond in it s limit include the bimetric theory of  @xcite and the dark fluid theory of  @xcite .    in mond ,",
    "the demand of the exotic dark matter is replaced by the modification of newton s second law : @xmath1 with @xmath2 m s@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is called interpolation function in literature sometimes .",
    "@xmath5 for @xmath6 ( the deep mond regime ) , and @xmath7 when @xmath8 ( the newtonian regime ) .",
    "here @xmath9 , the ratio of the acceleration to @xmath10 , is a measure of modified gravity .",
    "mond in its relativistic version teves @xcite  is not only able to explain cmb successfully with 2 ev neutrino mass @xcite but also even more successful than the @xmath0cdm paradigm on the dynamics of spiral galaxies @xcite .    unlike cold dark matter , however , massive neutrino can not aggregate at galactic scales and below , so any evidence for the demand of dark matter at these scales is devastating to mond . beside dynamical analysis on rotation curve ( of spiral galaxies ) , gravitational lensing offers us another way to investigate mond and teves at these scales .",
    "indeed , the requirement of dark matter in the bullet cluster makes gravitational lensing even more important @xcite .",
    "the earliest works about gravitational lensing in mond were studied by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "although their works were performed even before the appearance of a viable general covariant mond , and their calculations on the angle of deflection were artificially forced into the deep mond regime when the acceleration is less than @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 for @xmath12 ( not @xmath6 ) ,  @xcite and  @xcite could show a good guess on how to calculate lensing in mond . after the advent of teves , a first calculation on light bending in teves was done by bekenstein himself , and was followed up by @xcite . based on a point mass model ,",
    "@xcite apply the formalism of gravitational lesing in teves to the theoretical discussion on angle of deflection , magnification , as well as time delay .    on the other hand , taking from a more phenomenal approach ,  @xcite showed that teves is consistent with a sample of double - image lenses in castles catalogue by modeling lenses as hernquist model .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of asymmetric systems on gravitational lensing .",
    "@xcite then applied non - spherical model to investigate strong lensing in teves , and found 10 out of 15 systems are consistent with teves .",
    "all of other 5 systems are found to reside in or close to clusters of galaxy , where external field could have significant influence .",
    "furthermore , the effect of large filaments on gravitational lensing was studied by  @xcite .",
    "they argued that filamentary structures might have complex but significant contribution to the system such as bullet cluster , so the need of dark matter in bullet cluster might be spared again in mond .",
    "however , all of these work above are non - relativistic approximation of teves . in a conference paper ,",
    "@xcite also showed the lens data from castles and slacs catalog are consistent with teves , but they did not show the details .    the first effort to calculate gravitational lesing from first principle",
    "was given by  @xcite .",
    "along with their other works  @xcite , they showed that teves might still need dark matter to explain the lensing systems from castles , and is lack of consistent results between dynamical and gravitational lensing analysis  @xcite .    due to the importance of studying gravitational lesning in teves , and the inconsistency of the results on this field , in this paper",
    ", we are going to apply the relativistic approach developed by  @xcite and  @xcite , and the hernquist model ( used for teves firstly by  @xcite ) to the 10 double - image systems from a total of 18 objects studied in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will also clarify the underlying assumptions of lensing calculation in teves .",
    "the structure of the paper is organized as below . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we will briefly outline the formalism of gravitational lensing in teves .",
    "we will also discuss how gravitaional lensing in teves will depend on different choice of @xmath13 , and its application to double - image systems .",
    "we then will give our result in sec .",
    "[ deflectionangle ] , and discussion in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "while considering strong lensing in teves , we take the assumption that in the weak field limit , the physical metric of a static spherically symmetric system can be expressed in the isotropic form ( c=1 ) : @xmath14\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 as the asymptotic boundary value of @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the constrain of ppn parameters @xcite . since in teves",
    "all kinds of matter are coupled to physical metric rather than einstein s metric , the connection in the geodesic equation , @xmath20 has to be constructed from physical metric .",
    "here @xmath21 is some proper affine parameter . in the case of light bending by a static spherically symmetric lens , we can apply eq.([weakspherical ] ) to the geodesic equation , eq.([geodesic ] ) .",
    "consider a photon propagates on a null geodesic , and moves in the equatorial plane , i.e. , @xmath22 , the geodesic equation or equations of motion can be written as @xmath23 where over dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath21 .",

    "since for very large @xmath38 , @xmath33 behaves as @xmath39 , it is legitimate to ignore the second term of eq.([angle3 ] ) for strong lensing systems  @xcite .",
    "we then have the kernel equation of strong gravitational lensing in teves ( up to first order of @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 recall that @xmath42 is the distance of the closest approach , and @xmath43 is the mondian gravity .",
    "in last subsection we have shown that , under the assumption of the validity of eq.([weakspherical ] ) , the difference between the angle of deflection in gr and that in teves only arises from @xmath43 . in this subsection",
    ", we are going to discuss the relation between newtonian gravity , @xmath44 , and mondian gravity , @xmath43 , and its application to strong lensing .",

    "the scalar field itself is linked to the newtonian potential via a free function @xmath48  @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath48 is a function of @xmath50 .",
    "this free function @xmath48 should be chosen carefully in order to reproduce newtonian or mond behavior at quasi - static limits .",

    "therefore , the mondian behavior controlled by @xmath51 in milgrom s law eq .",
    "( [ mond ] ) could be understood via the parameters and free function in teves . on the other hand ,",
    "we are able to express the modified gravity @xmath40 ( even in teves ) as a function of newtonian gravity @xmath54 via @xmath51 . in the following",

    "their choices of @xmath48 are identical to the simple form and bekenstein s form in this paper , but a gap still exists between our result and  @xcite",
    ". the disparity might be due to the fact that we choose hernquist model rather than nfw model for the lens .",
    "our analysis also shows that the simple form seems to give the most reasonable angle of deflection in strong lensing , which coincides with the studies on the dynamics of spiral galaxies  @xcite .",
    "it is quite reasonable because the deviation of teves from gr in strong lensing is only due to the change of gravity ( possion equation ) .",
    "so we do expect a consistent conclusion between gravitational lensing and dynamical analysis .",

    "however , the assumption of spherical distribution is obviously insufficient for most known lenses .",
    "moreover , the choice of mass model for lens may also affect the inference of the total mass of the lens .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to study how the deviation from this assumption would affect our conclusion here .",
    "we note that while a spherical hernquist model is a reasonable assumption for some lenses , it is always a poor assumption for modeling rotation curves of spiral galaxies which have often exponential profiles in their disks , and the gravity is enhanced in the disk plane . in this regard",
