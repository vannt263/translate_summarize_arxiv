    "the galaxy populations within the virialised regions of rich clusters at @xmath14 are characterised by passive elliptical and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) .",
    "in contrast , 5-gyrs ago , at @xmath15 , the galaxy populations in the most massive clusters had larger fractions of star - forming late - type spirals , and a corresponding deficit of luminous s0 galaxies ( e.g.  dressler et al .  1997 ;",

    "these two observations imply that a process ( or processes ) is transforming many of the star - forming , late - type spirals in these regions into the passive early - type population ( specifically s0s ) found in local clusters ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; moran et al .",
    "2006 , in prep ) .",
    "when considering potential pathways to produce this evolutionary change , we need to bear in mind that the typical luminosities of the star - forming spirals appear to be too low for them to transform into typical s0 galaxies found in local clusters , without the addition of significant numbers of new stars ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; kodama & smail 2001 ) .",
    "this problem is exacerbated when we include the fading which is likely to take place after the cessation of star formation in these galaxies .",
    "this then leads us to concentrate on mechanisms which are capable of increasing the luminosity of the galaxies  mergers and starbursts .",
    "there has been a recent upsurge in interest in the potential for so - called `` dry '' mergers ( mergers between dissipationless stellar systems which do nt result in additional star formation ) to influence the evolution of early - type galaxies ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2003 ; bell et al .  2003",
    "; van dokkum 2005 ) . however , the dynamically hot environments in rich clusters which are the subject of our study are deleterious to the formation and survival of cold , bound - pairs of early - type galaxies  unless these systems arrive in the cluster as existing bound entities .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , that dry mergers can provide an effective route to substantially increase the number of luminous , early - type s0 galaxies within clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the alternative mechanism for enhancing the luminosity of the bulge component  a starburst  also has strong observational evidence stacked against it .",
    "surveys of star - forming galaxies in clusters using optical or uv star formation indicators have failed to detect galaxies with strongly enhanced star - formation which would have to exist to explain the growth of the bulge components of early - type galaxies in clusters at @xmath161 ( balogh et al .",
    "1999 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; gerken et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , there is growing body of evidence that at least some of the galaxies in distant clusters may be undergoing bursts of star - formation , albeit ones which are heavily shrouded in dust .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used a deep vla 1.4-ghz radio map to study a small sample of active galaxies within the core of the cluster cl0939 + 4713 ( @xmath17 ) . combining the radio data with near - infrared and optical morphological information from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and ground - based spectroscopy",
    ", they found that over half the radio - emitting population in the core are dusty late - type galaxies , presumably undergoing vigorous star formation .",
    "however , the spectral classification of these spirals placed them in the post - starburst class , and indeed all the post - starburst galaxies in this small region are radio - emitters .",
    "dust has also been used to explain the unusual spectral properties of another class of galaxies found in distant clusters and the field : e(a ) galaxies , which show enhanced balmer absorption compared to normal star - forming galaxies ( poggianti et al .",
    "poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) and poggianti , bressan & franceschini ( 2001 ) discuss models for these galaxies invoking age - dependent dust obscuration of the younger stellar populations  enabling significant activity to be hidden from view in these systems . if the passive lenticular galaxies found in local clusters , but absent from the equivalent rich environments at higher redshift , are the result of infalling late - type galaxies undergoing dusty - starburst in high-@xmath18 clusters , then a possible signature would be evolution in the total level of obscured star - formation in clusters out to @xmath19 .    in principle , mid- and especially far - infrared / submillimeter observations",
    "give us a direct probe of the level of obscured activity in distant clusters .",
    "in particular , mid - infrared observations with _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ , and more recently _ spitzer space telescope ( sst ) _ , provide sensitive imaging capabilities which can trace dusty star formation in clusters out to @xmath20 and beyond .",

    "all these studies suggest that there is an increased level of mid - infrared activity in distant clusters , at levels above that suggested by uv / optical tracers of star formation .",
    "submillimeter observations of more distant clusters have also hinted at possible enhanced activity in these environments ( best 2000 ; webb et al .",
    "however , the inhomogeneous mix of coverage and depth in the samples coupled with the modest numbers of sources detected in any individual cluster mean that it has proved difficult to use these data to provide quantitative constraints on the origin and evolution of dust - obscured activity in distant clusters .",
    "the _ sst _ s sensitive mid - infrared imaging capabilities provide an unique opportunity to undertake complete and representative surveys of the obscured , active populations in distant clusters . to search for a population of mid - infrared sources in rich clusters environments",
    ", we have therefore used the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) to detect 24-@xmath0 m emission from galaxies in two clusters at @xmath23 covering a very wide range in environment from @xmath24mpc out to the turn - around radius ( @xmath25mpc ) where the clusters merge into the surrounding field .",
    "these observations will provide measures of the level of obscured star - formation in these clusters , and so allow us to build up a reliable picture of the evolution of dust - obscured activity in clusters over the past 5gyrs .",

    "due to the ` first frame effect ' ( frames with a shorter exposure and a depression in response of up to 15% ) , the initial frame in each pointing was discarded , which improved flatness in the final mosaic .",

    "we next use the deep optical and near - infrared imaging of these fields to investigate the photometric properties of mid - infrared sources .",
    "the influence of false detections described above is minimised in the main part of our analysis , since we require the mid - infrared sources to have optical and near - infrared counterparts .",
    "positional matching of multi - wavelength data sets has been a long standing problem in astronomy , and can be particularly troublesome when there is a large disparity in the resolution and sampling in two datasets .",
    "we find that a simple nearest - neighbor match is not adequate to pair mid - infrared sources with optical counterparts  the method can fail to match complicated interacting systems for example .",
    "instead , we apply the technique of de ruiter , arp & willis ( 1977 ) who use a bayesian estimator for the probability , @xmath72 , that a nearby source is a true match and not a chance unrelated object . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly outline the key elements of the method , but refer the reader to de ruiter , arp & willis ( 1977 ) for a thorough derivation .",
    "the result of our matching analysis is a list of probable optical counterparts for the 24@xmath0 m sources in our catalogs .",

    "in ms0451@xmath403 this includes sources in the archival region .    in figure  1",
    "we plot the @xmath39 versus @xmath52 color - magnitude diagram for each cluster , comparing the distribution of colors for the mid - infrared sources and their apparent magnitudes with the optical population in these regions .",
    "the first thing to note is the broad similarity in the distributions on the color - magnitude plane of the 24@xmath0 m sources in the two fields .",
    "looking at the color distributions in more detail , the median @xmath39 color of mid - infrared sources at @xmath74 is 1.75 and 1.80 for cl0024 + 16 and ms0451@xmath403 respectively .",
    "the 24-@xmath0 m counterparts exhibit a broad peak in @xmath39 color , which lies between the peaks of red and blue galaxies ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this association of 24@xmath0 m sources with galaxies having transition colors is intriguing .",
    "it may simply reflect the fact that these galaxies are dustier examples of the general blue star - forming field population , where dust reddening produces somewhat redder colors . or it may be evidence that some of these galaxies are part of an evolutionary sequence connecting the blue star - forming population , and the passive types inhabiting the red - sequence .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the @xmath38 versus @xmath39 colors of the mid - infrared sources in cl0024 + 16 and ms0451@xmath403 compared to the optically - selected populations in the two fields .",
    "we also indicate the expected colors of cluster members with a range of spectral types ( king & ellis 1985 ) .",
    "these model colors provide a rough guide to the relative level of current to past star - formation in the galaxies and the reader should note that the influence of dust extinction will move galaxies parallel to this sequence , further complicating any interpretation of the star - formation histories of these galaxies .",
    "looking at the panel for cl0024 + 16 in figure  2 , we see a clear ridge of 24-@xmath0 m sources with colors comparable to those expected for cluster galaxies . to confirm this association ,",
    "we indicate on the plots the locations of spectroscopically confirmed 24@xmath0 m cluster members from the surveys of czoske et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and moran et al.(2006 ) , and our on - going spectroscopic follow - up of our 24@xmath0 m sample ( geach et al .  in prep ) .",
    "there are 45 confirmed 24@xmath0 m members in cl0024 + 16 and 7 in ms0451@xmath403 and the vast majority of these lie close to the predicted color - color locus for cluster members , and have colors consistent with star - forming galaxies . however a few fall in the region populated by passive , early - type cluster members , as expected due to the likely presence of active galactic nuclei in some of these galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the information from this @xmath39@xmath38 color - color plot can be used to crudely isolate likely 24-@xmath0 m cluster members to statistically gauge the size of this population in the two clusters .",
    "the ` transitional ' colors of the majority of 24@xmath0 m sources hinted at in the color - histograms in figure  1 , is also reflected in the distribution of points around the spectral classes in figure  2 .",
    "the colors of the bluer , probable 24@xmath0 m cluster members suggest these are moderately star - forming galaxies ( matching the continuum shapes of present - day sbc / scd galaxies ) . however , these could be more actively star - forming systems with additional reddening , @xmath751 , and there are a small number of galaxies with very red colors which suggest very significant reddening , @xmath76 mags . to select the majority of infrared cluster members , we apply a photometric cut in color - color space around the sequence of known cluster members ( figure  2 ) and then account for the residual field contamination using a similar color - selection applied to a blank field 24@xmath0 m sample . based on the existing spectroscopic samples of 24@xmath0 m sources in the two clusters , we estimate that our color - selection criteria identify 39/45 and 5/7 members in cl0024 + 16 and ms0451@xmath403 respectively , or an average completeness of 85% .",
    "we note that the fact that the reddening vector runs approximately parallel to our selection box in figure  2 means that it should contain a significant fraction of the more reddened sources .",
    "in addition , in this work we are investigating the nature of the star - forming cluster population , so we must be aware of contamination by infrared activity caused by agn in passive ( and also star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "therefore we define a sub - region in the color - space around the likely color of cluster e / s0s ( figure  2 ) , and do not include the galaxies within this region in our analysis of the obscured star - forming population .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m galaxy population in the ms0451@xmath403 field does not exhibit such a pronounced ridge with colors matching those expected for cluster members , as cl0024 + 16 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a weak overdensity , which is most obvious in a red clump associated with passive , early - type cluster members .",
    "this clump is around 0.2mags redder in @xmath39 and @xmath38 than the equivalent feature in cl0024 + 16 , as expected from the @xmath77-correction for passive galaxies between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "again , the small number of spectroscopically confirmed 24@xmath0 m members fall close to the locus expected for the colors of cluster members and we therefore use this color - color selection in the subsequent sections to investigate the properties of this population .    fig .",

    "the total infrared luminosities are derived by extrapolating the monochromatic mips 24@xmath0 m flux , assuming the local 15@xmath0m  far - infrared correlation holds at @xmath23 ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the estimated number of 24@xmath0 m cluster members in ms0451@xmath403 is insufficient to provide a similar plot for that cluster . for comparison , we plot the luminosity function of the 60@xmath0 m _ iras _ point source catalog redshift ( psc_z _ ) survey from takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with an arbitrary normalisation .",
    "the cluster luminosity function is similar in shape with that of3 local field galaxies , given the large uncertainties .      to quantify the number of 24@xmath0 m sources associated with cluster members",
    "we first compare the 24@xmath0 m number counts for each cluster to counts from the literature for large area 24-@xmath0 m field surveys ( e.g. marleau et al .",
    "2004 ; papovich et al .",
    "2004 ; chary et al .",
    "the counts in the literature all agree well in the flux density regime covered by our data and we use the model presented in marleau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to estimate the number of field 24@xmath0 m galaxies expected with @xmath781000@xmath0jy in our fields : @xmath79 , which is valid for the range 200900@xmath0jy , we extrapolate the bright end to 1000@xmath0jy . for this comparison",
    "we also correct our counts for completeness in the range 200300@xmath0jy ( our simulations show that our observations are @xmath1100% complete at 300@xmath0jy ) .    the predicted numbers of 24@xmath0 m sources to our flux limits over the cl0024 + 16 and ms0451@xmath403 fields are 1280@xmath80160 and 939@xmath80120 respectively , down to 200@xmath0jy .",
    "these should be compared to the observed numbers sources of 1032 and 935 , respectively .",
    "based on this comparison we can see that the cluster populations do not represent a significant excess over the large field population across the full survey area and down to the flux limits of our survey .",
    "this is not particularly surprising as the survey fields are large and our sensitivity limit is sufficient to detect sources in a large volume out to high - redshifts . instead ,",
    "if we restrict the comparison to the central regions of the clusters , where the contrast of the cluster over the background might be largest , we see that at projected radii of @xmath81mpc there is a slight excess of mid - infrared sources compared to the field counts in cl0024 + 16 : @xmath82 observed sources compared to @xmath83 predicted for the field , suggesting a modest cluster population . while in ms0451@xmath403 , including the archival data for the core , and we find that within 2mpc there are @xmath84 sources compared to @xmath85 predicted by the model  showing no detectable overdensity in this cluster even in the central regions .    the lack of a detectable excess in the raw counts of 24@xmath0 m sources in the cluster fields does not rule out a significant cluster population given the large uncertainties in the contribution from field sources . to provide a more sensitive test we can exploit the optical - near - infrared photometry to remove the bulk of the background field contamination and so reduce the uncertainty in the field correction . in figure  3",

    "we translate our @xmath39@xmath38 selection box in figure  2 to the equivalent region in @xmath87@xmath88 space for the swire sample using model spectral energy distributions ( fig .  2 ) to transform between the various colors . extrapolating the number counts of these color - selected sources to our 200@xmath0jy limit ( by fitting a power - law , @xmath89 , to the counts )",

    "the estimates of the total cluster populations could be increased by @xmath42% to account for the incompleteness of our color - selection , although to be conservative we choose not to apply this correction .",
    "while it is clear that there are populations of 24@xmath0 m cluster members , we also need to consider lensing of background sources by these massive clusters , which may affect the predicted numbers of cluster members .",
    "lensing has the effect of a boosting of flux and dilating the projected area . to demonstrate this we model the clusters as simple isothermal spheres . in this case",
    "a background source will suffer an apparent deflection in radial direction by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the cluster velocity dispersion in units of 1000kms@xmath29 .",

    "the reader should also note that the lack of mid - infrared coverage for the core of the cluster will contribute to the steeper drop of the 24@xmath0 m counts in the innermost bin in figure  3 .",
