    "consideration was previously given to the analysis of functions of one variable using the square wave method ( swm ) @xcite .",
    "this method , which will be reviewed briefly in the following section , was generalized for functions of two variables and applied to the analysis of images @xcite .",
    "the objective of this article is to specify how the results obtained by analyzing signals with the swm can be presented in the frequency domain clearly and concisely , using the mathematical process described below : the square wave transform ( swt ) .",
    "given that this article is devoted to the analysis of signals , it will be considered that the independent variable is time ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a function of a variable @xmath0 , which in a given interval @xmath2 , satisfies the conditions of dirichlet @xcite .",
    "that function can then be approximated in that interval by means of a particular sum of trains of square waves .",
    "the use of the swm makes it possible to specify these trains of square waves unambiguously .",
    "consider , for example , the function @xmath1 , as indicated below :",
    "@xmath3    in figure  [ f1 ] , @xmath1 is shown for the interval specified in ( 1 ) .",
    ".,width=336 ]    note that the interval of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) , in which @xmath1 will be analyzed , has a length of 1 second ( 1 s ) : @xmath4 .",
    "first , an explanation will be given about how to proceed if one wants to obtain an approximation to @xmath1 , in the interval @xmath2 specified in ( 1 ) , composed of the sum of 10 trains of square waves .",
    "the interval @xmath2 is then divided into a number of sub - intervals  of equal length  which is the same as the number of the trains of square waves . in this case",
    ", there will be 10 sub - intervals .",
    "the approximation to @xmath1 to be obtained in interval @xmath2 will be the sum of 10 trains of square waves : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ",
    ", @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the first of the trains of square waves will be referred to by @xmath5 , the second by @xmath6 , and so on .",
    "each of these trains of waves @xmath10 , for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , will be characterized by a certain frequency @xmath13 ( that is , the number of waves in the train of square waves considered which is contained in the unit of time ) , and a certain coefficient @xmath14 whose absolute value is the amplitude of the corresponding train .    for the case considered here , a description will be provided below of how the amplitudes corresponding to the different trains of square waves are determined ( see figure  [ f2 ] ) .    .",
    "( see indications in text.),width=384 ]    the vertical arrow pointing down at the right of figure  [ f2 ] indicates how to add the terms corresponding to each of the 10 sub - intervals of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , to obtain the values of the coefficients corresponding to @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ",
    ", @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , the following system of linear algebraic equations must be solved :    @xmath15    in the preceding system of linear algebraic equations ( 2 ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ,  , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the values for @xmath1 as specified in ( 1 ) at the mid - points of the first , second , third ,  ,",
    "ninth , and tenth sub - intervals , respectively , of the interval @xmath2 in which @xmath1 is analyzed .",
    "it follows that the values @xmath21 , for @xmath22 and @xmath12 , can be computed given that @xmath1 has been specified in ( 1 ) .",
    "these values are : @xmath23    the ten unknowns of the system of equations specified in ( 2 ) are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,  , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 refers to the amplitude of the train of square waves @xmath10 , for @xmath30 .",
    "the ( constant ) value of each positive square semi - wave of the train of square waves @xmath10 is @xmath29 , and the ( constant ) value of each negative square semi - wave of that @xmath10 is @xmath31 . for the case discussed here , in which @xmath2 was divided into 10 equal sub - intervals ,",
    "the frequencies corresponding to the different trains of waves are the following :    @xmath32    in general , if the interval @xmath2  whose value , of course , may be different from 1 s  is divided into @xmath33 equal sub - intervals , the frequencies corresponding to the different @xmath33 trains of square waves are as follows :    @xmath34    the accuracy of the preceding equations may be checked by consulting figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "thus , half of the square wave @xmath5 , for example , occupies the unit of time ( 1 s ) , for @xmath35 ; one square wave of @xmath36 occupies @xmath2 , for @xmath37 ; five square waves of @xmath9 occupy @xmath2 , for @xmath38 , etc .",
    "if @xmath2 is equal to the unit of time ( 1 s ) , and if it is admitted that @xmath2 is divided into @xmath33 sub - intervals , the general expression for the frequencies of trains of square waves @xmath39 is as follows :    @xmath40    the system of equations ( 2 ) was solved by using lapack @xcite , and the following results were obtained for the unknowns : @xmath41    the trains of square waves @xmath42 , and @xmath9 have been shown for interval @xmath2 , in figures  [ f3a ] ,  [ f3b ] ,  [ f3c ] ,  ,  [ f3i ] , and  [ f3j ] , respectively .",

    ", specified in ( 1 ) , by @xmath43.,width=384 ]    if one wants to achieve a better approximation to @xmath1 , in interval @xmath2 , by adding the trains of square waves , then @xmath2 should be divided into a larger number of equal sub - intervals",
    ". the larger the number of these sub - intervals , the better the approximation . thus , for example",
    ", the approximation to @xmath1 that can be achieved if @xmath2 is divided into 100 sub - intervals of equal length , is shown in figure  [ f5 ] . in this case , it is clear that 100 trains of square waves were added together .    , specified in ( 1 ) , by @xmath44.,width=432 ]",
    "the swm can not be considered a branch of fourier analysis ; that is , the trains of square waves @xmath10 , for @xmath45 , do not make up a system of orthogonal functions .",
    "first , let us consider the results obtained when using the swt to analyze the function @xmath1 specified in ( 1 ) , for the case in which the interval @xmath2 was divided into 10 equal sub - intervals",
    ". these results can be presented by a sequence of 10 dyads ( ordered pairs ) such that the first element of the first dyad is the frequency @xmath46 corresponding to @xmath5 , and the second element of that first dyad is the coefficient @xmath24 ; the first element of the second dyad is the frequency @xmath47",
    "corresponding to @xmath6 , and the second element of that second dyad is the coefficient @xmath25 ; and so on successively , such that the first element of the tenth dyad is the frequency @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath9 , and the second element of that tenth dyad is the coefficient @xmath28 :    @xmath49    this approximation of the function @xmath1 specified in ( 1 ) can be expressed in the frequency domain . to achieve this objective , for each of the frequencies considered , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath50 , ",

    "@xmath51 will be used to refer to the number of equal sub - intervals into which @xmath2 is divided .    in figure",
