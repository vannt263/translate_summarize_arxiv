    "high temperatures and densities may be generated in the most central ( head - on ) nuclear collisions , perhaps creating the conditions in which a phase of deconfined quarks and gluons exists @xcite .",
    "the fireball produced in such collisions undergoes a complex dynamical evolution , and understanding of the conditions at the hot , dense early phase of the collision requires understanding of the full reaction dynamics .",
    "transverse energy  is generated by the initial scattering of the partonic constituents of the incoming nuclei and possibly also by reinteractions among the produced partons and hadrons @xcite .",
    "if the fireball of produced quanta breaks apart quickly without significant reinteraction , the observed transverse energy per unit rapidity  will be the same as that generated by the initial scatterings . at the other extreme ,",
    "if the system reinteracts strongly , achieving local equilibrium early and maintaining it throughout the expansion ,  will decrease significantly during the fireball evolution due to the longitudinal work performed by the hydrodynamic pressure @xcite .",
    "this decrease will however be moderated by the buildup of transverse hydrodynamic flow , which increases  @xcite .",
    "finally , gluon saturation in the wave function of the colliding heavy nuclei can delay the onset of hydrodynamic flow , reducing the effective pressure and thereby also reducing the difference between initially generated and observed  @xcite .",
    "production in nuclear collisions has been studied at lower @xmath2 at the ags and cern @xcite and at rhic @xcite . within the framework of boost - invariant hydrodynamics @xcite ,",
    "these measurements suggest that energy densities have been achieved at the sps @xcite that exceed the deconfinement energy density predicted by lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "however , from the foregoing discussion it is seen that several competing dynamical effects can contribute to the observed .",
    "while the measurement of  alone can not disentangle these effects , a systematic study of  together with other global event properties , in particular charged multiplicity and mean transverse momentum @xmath3 , may impose significant constraints on the collision dynamics @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the measurement of  distributions from au+au collisions at @xmath4 gev per nucleon - nucleon pair , measured by the star detector at rhic .",

    "section vi is a summary and discussion of the main results .",
    "this analysis is based on 150k minimum bias au+au collisions measured by the star detector in the 2001 rhic run .",

    "we describe the detectors which are relevant to the present analysis .",
    "the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) @xcite is a lead - scintillator sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with equal volumes of lead and scintillator .",
    "it has a radius of 2.3 m and is situated just inside the coils of the star solenoidal magnet .",
    "the electromagnetic energy resolution of the detector is @xmath11 .",
    "the results presented in this work used the first emc patch installed for the 2001 rhic run consisting of 12 modules , @xmath12% of the full planned detector , with coverage @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "each emc module is composed of 40 towers ( 20 towers in @xmath8 by 2 towers in @xmath14 ) constructed to project to the center of the star detector .",
    "the transverse dimensions of a tower are approximately 10 x 10 @xmath15 , which at the radius of the front face of the detector correspond to a phase space interval of ( @xmath16)=(0.05 , 0.05 ) .",
    "the tower depth is 21 radiation lengths ( @xmath17 ) , corresponding to approximately one hadronic interaction length . when fully installed , the complete barrel will consist of 120 modules with pseudorapidity coverage @xmath18 and full azimuthal coverage .    the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite has a pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath19 for collisions in the center of star , with full azimuthal coverage . in this work ,",
    "the acceptance of the measurement was limited by the acceptance of the emc .",
    "for charged tracks in the acceptance , the tpc provides up to 45 independent spatial and specific ionization @xmath20 measurements .",
    "the @xmath20 measurement in combination with the momentum measurement determines the particle mass within limited kinematic regions .",
    "the magnetic field was 0.5 tesla .",
    "tpc track quality cuts included @xmath21-coordinate ( longitudinal axis ) selection of the collision vertex within 20 cm of the tpc center and a minimum tpc track space point cut of 10 .",

    "the event trigger consisted of the coincidence of signals from the two zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) @xcite , located at @xmath27 mrad about the beam downstream of the first accelerator dipole magnet and sensitive to spectator neutrons .",
    "these calorimeters provide a minimum bias trigger which , after collision vertex reconstruction , corresponds to @xmath28 of the geometric cross section @xmath29 .",
    "the events were analysed in centrality bins based on the charged particle multiplicity in @xmath30 .",
    "the procedures used in the analysis provide independent measurement of electromagnetic transverse energy and the transverse energy carried by charged hadrons .",
    "this latter quantity , corrected to take into account the contribution of the long - lived neutral hadrons , is designated the hadronic transverse energy .",
    "the hadronic component of the transverse energy is obtained from momentum analyzed tracks in the tpc while the electromagnetic fraction is derived from the electromagnetic calorimeter data corrected for hadronic contamination using tpc tracking . in the following sections we describe how each of these contributions were analyzed to obtain the total transverse energy  measurement .",
    "the hadronic transverse energy  is defined as    @xmath32    where the sum runs over all hadrons produced in the collision , except @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath33 is the polar angle relative to the beam axis and the collision vertex position .",

    "@xmath42 is the energy associated with the particular track , either total or kinetic , as described above , computed from the measured momentum and particle identity ( i d ) as described below .",
    "the factor @xmath43 is defined as :    @xmath44    which includes the corrections for the uncertainty in the particle i d determination , @xmath45 , momentum dependent tracking efficiency , @xmath46 , and momentum dependent backgrounds , @xmath47 .",
    "next , we describe the corrections included in these two factors .    particle identification was carried out using the measurements of momentum and truncated mean specific ionization @xmath48 in the tpc . for @xmath49 gev/@xmath23 ,",
    "assignment was made to the most probable particle type relative to the bethe - bloch expectation .",
    "particles were assumed to be pions if @xmath48 differed from this expectation by more than three standard deviations , or if @xmath50 gev/@xmath23 .",
    "the uncertainty in this procedure was gauged by calculating  for @xmath51 gev/@xmath23 both with the correct particle assignments and with all particles assumed to be pions .",
    "the ratio of these values for  is applied as a correction for particles that can not be identified , yielding an overall correction factor to  of @xmath52 .",
    "because this correction was calculated from low momentum particles it does not account for the centrality variations in the particle ratios with @xmath50 gev / c @xcite . on the other hand , particles at @xmath50 gev / c account for about 20% of the total number of particles .",
    "taking into account the centrality - dependence increases in the p/@xmath53 and k/@xmath53 ratios at higher  generates a change in the estimated hadronic  on the order of 2% , which is within the systematic error of @xmath45 .    only tracks with a transverse momentum @xmath54 gev/@xmath23",
    "were accepted because the tracking efficiency drops rapidly below this value .",
    "geant @xcite detector simulations of hijing @xcite events demonstrate that this cut excludes 5% of the total .",
    "a correction @xmath41 for this effect is included in @xmath37 . taking all simulated tracks for @xmath55 gev/@xmath23 and calculating the energy assuming pions in two extreme cases , one with momentum @xmath56 and other with @xmath57 gev/@xmath23 resulted in a variation of 3% in , which was assigned as the systematic uncertainty due to this correction .",
    "since only primary charged tracks measured by the tpc are used in this analysis , we need to correct  to include the contribution from long - lived neutral hadrons , principally @xmath58(@xmath59 ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62(@xmath63 ) .",
    "the correction factor applied to the data , defined as @xmath64 , can be estimated using measurements by star at 130 gev .",
    "we assume , based on hijing simulations , that @xmath40 does not change significantly from 130 gev to 200 gev .",
    "we assume that the spectrum shape and yield for @xmath60 are the same as for @xmath61 .",
    "the same approximation was applied in the case of @xmath58(@xmath59 ) , after subtraction of the contribution from @xmath65 decays from the measured @xmath66 yield , and the measured star @xmath67 ratio @xcite . using this procedure",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath68 .",
    "the uncertainty on this correction was estimated from the uncertainties in the measured star spectra . a cross check of these correction factors utilizing 200 gev measurements @xcite generates variations well within the assigned systematic uncertainties .",
    "the correction @xmath47 for background , consisting of electrons , weak - decays and secondary tracks that are misidentified as primary , depends on the type of the track and is divided into two separate corrections .",
    "the first is for the electrons which are misidentified as hadrons .",
    "this correction was estimated using the shape of the electron spectrum obtained from hijing and geant simulations and the absolute yield from star data in the region where electrons are identified with high purity using the tpc @xmath20 measurements ( essentially below 300 mev ) .",
    "the second term is due to weak decays , which have been included in @xmath40 and therefore must be excluded from the primary track population to avoid double counting of their energy . in this case , the correction factor was calculated by embedding simulated particles into real events . by comparison between the simulated particles and the reconstructed ones , the fraction of secondary tracks assigned as primary was evaluated . @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath69 were simulated using the experimental yield and spectral shape measured by star @xcite .    the tpc reconstruction efficiency , @xmath46 ,",

    "the charged track efficiency correction is the average , weighted by the relative populations of each of these species .",
    "the track reconstruction efficiency depends on the transverse momentum of the tracks and the total track density .",
    "for central events the efficiency is about 0.7 for tracks with @xmath70 gev/@xmath23 and reaches a plateau at about 0.8 for @xmath71 gev/@xmath23 .",
