    "graphene exhibits remarkable thermal properties .",
    "the measured values of thermal conductivity of graphene reach as high as several thousand of watt per meter kelvin@xcite , and these are among the highest values of known materials .",
    "heat transport measures the energy carried by both electrons and phonons and is fundamental to understanding a material , its ground states , excitations and scattering mechanisms .",
    "if the dream of carbon - based electronics is to be realized , it is essential to study how and how fast heat is dissipated across graphene devices .",
    "this requires systematic measurements of thermal conductivity and thermopower over a broad temperature range ( 1.5 - 300 kelvin ) under various external conditions .",
    "therefore , recently there has been considerable interest , both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite , in the study of thermoelectric and magnetothermoelectric transport in graphene .",
    "this is partly due to the realization that the information provided by thermoelectric transport is complementary to electrical transport . and thermoelectric and magnetothermoelectric transport studies are extremely useful in providing insight on the scattering mechanism involved in transport .",
    "fundamentally related to the electrical conductivity , the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric coefficients can be determined by the band structure and scattering mechanisms .",
    "the thermoelectric coefficients involve the energy derivatives of the electrical transport counterparts such as the conductivity @xmath2@xcite .",
    "recent measurements of thermoelectric power(tep ) on graphene samples in zero and non - zero magnetic fields have shown a linear temperature dependence of tep which suggest that the dominant contribution is that of diffusive thermopower ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a comparison between the measured tep and that predicted by the mott formula shows general agreement , particularly at lower temperatures ( @xmath4)@xcite .",
    "however , at higher temperatures deviation from the mott relation have been reported@xcite . in theoretical work ,",
    "yan et al.@xcite have determined the tep of dirac fermions in graphene with in the self - consistent born approximation . also , hwang et al.@xcite , in their calculation of tep incorporate the energy dependence of various transport scattering rates and show that the dominant contribution is from the screened charged impurities in graphene s environment .",
    "further , vaidya et al.@xcite used boltzmann transport theory to calculate @xmath3 in graphene after considering contributions of optical phonon and surface roughness scatterings .",
    "application of a magnetic field in addition to a thermal gradient has profound effects on the thermal transport in a system and serves as an additional probe . when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the @xmath5 plane of the sample , the diffusing charge carriers experience the lorentz force .",
    "this results in developing a transverse electric field @xmath6 in addition to the longitudinal field @xmath7 .",
    "the thermopower is determined from the thermal gradient @xmath8 and the induced voltage @xmath9 as @xmath10 also known as the seebeck coefficient ) and @xmath11(the nernst coefficient ) .",
    "they are a measure of the magnitude of the longitudinal and transverse voltages generated in response to an applied temperature gradient .",
    "they are very sensitive in graphene due to its semimetal nature@xcite .",
    "the quantum magnetic oscillations in electrical and thermal transport have been earlier investigated theoretically by gusynin and sharapov@xcite and they obtained analytical results for longitudinal thermal conductivity and the nernst coefficient .",
    "however , they assumed a scattering rate that is constant in energy , independent of magnetic field and temperature . hence the self energy used is not self consistent",
    "moreover , they evaluated the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of the magnetic field at different temperatures but at fixed chemical potential and constant impurity broadening .",
    "further , they determined the nernst coefficient ( signal ) without recourse to the modified kubo formalism appropriate for thermal transport in a magnetic field .",
    "they neglected the dependence of @xmath12 on the chemical potential/ carrier concentration .",
    "dora and thalmeier extended the work presented in @xcite and studied the electric and thermal response of two dimensional dirac fermions in a quantizing magnetic field in the the presence of localized disorder@xcite.they evaluated the seeback coefficient and the corresponding thermal conductivity as a function of the chemical potential and the magnetic field .",
    "they did not determine the nernst coefficient and the transverse thermal conductivity .",
    "what distinguishes our work on unmodulated graphene from the aforementioned previous papers is that we employ the modified kubo formalism required to study thermal transport in a magnetic field .",
    "as has been discussed earlier , the usual kubo formula for thermal response functions is invalid in a magnetic field and needs to be modified when calculating the transverse ( hall ) thermal conductivity and the nernst coeffecient@xcite .",
    "we use the phenomenological transport equations obtained from the modified kubo formalism@xcite . further ,",
    "in the scattering rate and the impurity broadening of the landau levels the effects of the carrier concentration that can be varied by the gate voltage are taken into account . in the first stage , we determine the components of magnetoelectrothermal(met ) power and met conductivity of an unmodulated graphene monolayer in the presence of randomly distributed charged impurities .",
    "the results are presented as a function of the gate voltage for small and large magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet .",
    "we determine both the nernst and seeback coefficients as well as longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity .",
    "these results are then compared with experimental work .",
    "in addition , we have also carried out a detailed investigation of the met transport properties of a graphene monolayer which is modulated by a weak one - dimensional periodic potential in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "motivation for this has arisen from recent work , experimental and theoretical , that has shown that interaction with a substrate can lead to weak periodic modulation of the graphene spectrum .",
    "furthermore , applying patterned gate voltage or placing graphene on a pre - patterned substrate can also lead to modulated graphene@xcite .",
    "placing impurities or adatom deposition can do the same . in a previous work ,",
    "we have computed the electric transport coefficients of electrically modulated graphene@xcite .",
    "it was shown that modulation turns the sharp landau levels into bands whose width oscillates periodically with the magnetic field .",
    "this affects the magnetoelectric transport coefficients which exhibit commensurabilty ( weiss ) oscillations .",
    "the origin of these weiss oscillations is the commensurability of the two characteristic length scales of the system : the cyclotron diameter at the fermi energy and the period of the modulation@xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of electronic conduction in the modulated system is the opening of the diffusive ( band ) transport channel in addition to hopping ( collisional ) transport .",
    "both these contributions to met transport are taken into account in this work .    in the following section , we present the general formulation of the magnetoelectrothermal transport problem and perform the calculation of the thermopower and the thermal conductivity of unmodulated graphene as well as graphene subjected to one - dimensional ( 1d ) weak periodic modulation .",
    "the results for the transport coefficients as a function of gate voltage ( @xmath13 ) for unmodulated graphene are discussed in section iii , where we also make a comparison with experimental results . following this in section iv ,",
    "the results for modulated graphene as a function of the gate voltage and the external magnetic field are presented .",
    "the present paper ends with a summary and conclusions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , corrections to the usual kubo formula for transport have to be made when studying thermal transport in a magnetic field .",
    "this was carried out by luttinger , smerka , streda and oji@xcite .",

    "the former is the localized state contribution which carries the effects of  shubnikov de hass ( sdh ) oscillations that are modified by periodic modulation .",
    "the diffusive contribution is the extended state contribution and arises due to finite drift velocity acquired by the charge carriers in the presence of modulation . in the linear response regime , the conductivity tensor is a sum of a diagonal and a non diagonal part : @xmath73 , @xmath74 . in general , @xmath75 accounting for both diffusive and collisional contribution whereas @xmath76 is the hall contribution . here ,",

    "( 1 ) ) , the oscillations are more closely spaced since the separation between the landau levels , which is proportional to the magnetic field strength , is smaller compared to the results for the higher magnetic field of 8.8 tesla , ( fig .",
    "moreover , we observe in figs .",

    "the reason for this is that higher @xmath13 corresponds to higher values of the fermi energy and if the fermi energy is much larger that the landau level separation , landau quantization effects are lost . at @xmath133 ( fig .",
    "( 2a ) ) , the oscillations in @xmath125 and @xmath132 show that the width of the peaks broaden compared to those for smaller magnetic field of @xmath134 . at lower magnetic field ,",

    "the splitting of the peaks in the longitudinal thermal condutivity @xmath135 is seen in fig .",
    "( 2b ) which was also observed in @xcite where it is shown that the splitting occurs in such a way that they produce antiphase oscillations with respect to the electric one and lead to the violation of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "for the un - modulated case , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and using eq.([12 ] ) through eq.([19 ] ) we find that @xmath131 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "we find that the results for magnetothermal power obtained in our work at @xmath141 with @xmath142 are in good agreement , both qualitative and quantitative , with the experimental results obtained in @xcite , see fig ( 3 ) of @xcite .",
    "these results do indicate that scattering from screened charged impurities is the dominant scattering mechanism required to explain the experimental results .",
    "we must add that our quantitative results for @xmath128 depend strongly on the mobility of the graphene system .",
    "now we consider the effects of modulation .",
    "the 1d modulation broadens the sharp landau levels into bands and gives rise to an additional diffusive ( or band ) contribution to transport .",
    "this additional contribution is absent without modulation .",
    "we now focus on the modulation induced changes in the thermal magnetotransport coefficients of graphene .",

    "the difference between the modulated case and the unmodulated case highlights the modulation induced effects in these thermoelectric quantities .",
    "the thermopower and the change in thermopower due to modulation @xmath169 are shown in fig .",
    "( 7 ) as a function of the magnetic field in the units of @xmath170 .",

    "the different components of the thermal conductivity tensor and the correction to it due to 1d modulation are shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the thermal conductivity tensor is similar to that of the electrical conductivity tensor obtained in @xcite . in fig .",
