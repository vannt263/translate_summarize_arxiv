    "the major goal of the alice experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to study the creation of a new state of strongly interacting matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is expected to form when sufficiently high initial energy densities are attained in heavy - ion collisions .    to study the full evolution of the produced medium the usage of so called _ hard probes _ is of particular interest .",
    "parton - parton scatterings with large momentum transfer @xmath2 ( _ hard_)@xcite occur in the early stages of the reaction , in heavy - ion collisions well before the formation of an equilibrated medium . and",
    "while in p@xmath0p collisions the partons evolve in the qcd - vacuum and fragment directly into jets of observable hadrons , the evolution in heavy - ion collisions is influenced by the presence of a medium with large density of color charges .",
    "thus , scattered partons can lose energy via medium induced gluon radiation or elastic scattering , with the amount of energy loss depending on the color charge and mass of the parton , the traversed path length , and the medium - density @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest predicted consequences has been the suppression of hadrons with large transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) compared to the expectation from scaled p+p reactions @xcite .",
    "this comparison is usually done in a ratio of cross sections in p@xmath0p and @xmath3 , the nuclear modification factor @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 accounts for the increased number of nucleons in the incoming @xmath7-nuclei and is related to the number of binary collisions @xmath8 by @xmath9 . in the absence of any medium effects and at sufficiently high @xmath1 , where hard scattering is the dominant source of particle production , @xmath4 should be unity , any deviation from unity indicating the influence of the medium .    indeed , already the first hadron measurements in au@xmath0au reactions at rhic showed a hadron yield suppressed up to a factor of five and a suppression of jet - like correlation in central collisions@xcite .",
    "this suppression can be explained by the energy loss of hard scattered partons via induced gluon bremsstrahlung in a medium with high color density , which is also supported by the absence of suppression in the yield of direct photons.@xcite    up to date , most measurements of the medium modification of hard scattered partons are based on single particle measurements , which have been used to deduce jet - like properties such as back - to - back correlations , spectral shape / yield and their changes in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this has the disadvantage that the population of each single particle @xmath1-bin is highly biased towards a hard fragmentation .",
    "the bias can be largely reduced by reconstruction of full jets , which also allows for a detailed investigation of the expected modification of the jet structure@xcite by comparing momentum distributions of particles in jets created in @xmath10 and p@xmath0p reactions .",
    "however , the measurement of jets in heavy - ion collision is hindered by the presence of a large background and its fluctuation .",
    "it recently succeeded for the first time at rhic energies of @xmath11  gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but the potential of full jet reconstruction in heavy - ion collisions for a more quantitative understanding of the medium properties will only be exploited at lhc energies where the increase in jet cross section allows for a better separation of the jet signal from the background in a larger kinematical range .",
    "however , for a clear interpretation of all high @xmath12 observables in heavy - ion collision a detailed understanding of p+p reactions is essential .",
    "the comparison to predictions for the new energy regime reached at the lhc in p+p collisions at @xmath13  tev , provides an important test of our theoretical understanding of the underlying processes in these elementary collisions .",
    "the alice detector with its excellent tracking and pid capabilities provides an ideal tool for the studies of jet structure and composition over a large dynamic range from jet transverse momenta of about 100  gev/@xmath14 during the first lhc run down to particle @xmath15 of 100 mev/@xmath14.@xcite",

    "particle correlation functions have been measured by alice in p+p collisions at @xmath20 and @xmath21  gev .",

    "the expected back - to - back structure is clearly seen down to the lowest @xmath22 : a peak in direction of the trigger particle ( @xmath25 , _ near side _ ) and a peak at @xmath26 ( _ away side _ ) .    the width of the distribution on the near side is only given by the non - pertubative fragmentation process , which leads to a transverse momentum component ( @xmath27 ) of the produced hadrons with respect to the direction of the original parton .",
    "assuming a two dimensional gaussian distribution of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 components of the @xmath27 vector , one can extract its mean value directly from the near - side width @xmath30:@xcite @xmath31 the results for different @xmath22 and the two collision energies measured by alice are shown in fig .",

    "overall no change with either the trigger @xmath1 nor the center of mass energy is observed .    due to the fact that the trigger particle direction fixes the near - side axis all effects of interjet - correlations are seen on the away - side . in particular deviations from the exact momentum balance of the outgoing partons",
    "lead to additional broadening of the away - side peak .",
    "it is expressed in terms of a net transverse momentum of the parton pair @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the effective magnitude of the apparent transverse momentum of each colliding parton caused mainly by a combination of the intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons in the nucleons , and initial and final state radiation .",

    "the mean momentum fraction from the original parton that is carried away by the trigger hadron @xmath39 can be calculated based only on the shape of the fragmentation function .",

    "jets in alice are reconstructed using a variety of different algorithms : e.g. sequential recombination algorithms ( anti-@xmath41 and @xmath41 ) , simple cone algorithms as well as the modern seedless and infrared safe cone ( siscone ) algorithm .",

    "when comparing these reconstructed jets to full particle jets the momentum scale is shifted to lower values by roughly a factor of 0.6 due to the missing neutral energy and the jet resolution is dominated by charged - to - neutral fluctuations in addition to the instrumental momentum resolution . the raw jet spectrum ( not corrected for the aforementioned effects ) from reconstructed tracks",
