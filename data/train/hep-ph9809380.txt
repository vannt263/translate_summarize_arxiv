    "from a phenomenological point of view , photon production is considered as a potential candidate for the detection and discrimination of a quark gluon plasma .",
    "this quantity is also interesting from a more formal point of view in order to test our control over some aspects of thermal field theories like infrared and collinear singularities .",
    "one reason is that this quantity is obviously observable and should therefore be infrared and collinear safe in a consistent theory .    at one loop ,",
    "the thermal production of soft real photons @xcite suffers from a logarithmic collinear singularity , that can be cured by an extension of the hard thermal loop resummation technique proposed by flechsig and rebhan @xcite .",
    "it appeared also that common processes like bremsstrahlung are not present at one loop , while they are assumed to play the dominant role in semi - classical approaches @xcite .",
    "therefore , we considered the two - loop diagrams giving bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "it turns out that they suffer from collinear singularities much stronger than the 1-loop ones .",
    "after regularization by a thermal mass of order @xmath0 , these singularities give extra factors @xmath1 , which spoils the natural hierarchy of perturbative expansion .",
    "i present this calculation in this proceedings .",
    "then , i compare the result with that of other approaches , and finally , i conclude with some open questions related to what might happen at higher orders .",
    "this first section is devoted to a presentation of the tools we used in order to perform this calculation .",
    "the general framework of our study is the effective perturbative expansion that one obtains after the resummation of hard thermal loops @xcite . to be more definite",
    ", we used the retarded - advanced version of the real time formalism @xcite .",
    "initially , one of the motivations for hard thermal loops was the resolution of the long standing puzzle of the gluon damping rate , but they provided also a consistent framework to deal with the infrared sector of thermal theories .      a possible way to implement calculations in this effective theory is to use cut - offs @xcite : loops with effective propagators and vertices are evaluated with an upper cut - off @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "if higher order corrections are not necessary , the cut - off dependence is usually of a smaller order of magnitude .",
    "if on the contrary an important dependence on @xmath2 is observed , then one must include higher order diagrams correcting this loop , in which @xmath2 must be used as a lower cut - off to prevent double counting .",
    "one should then check that the sum of both terms is @xmath2 independent at the desired order .",
    "this procedure has been used also in @xcite to calculate the hard real photon production rate .",
    "the results are illustrated graphically on figure [ fig : cut - off ] , which represents numerical evaluations of one- and two - loop contributions to the photon polarization tensor .",
    "this procedure can also be interpreted more formally in terms of an effective lagrangian and counterterms . the proper way to perform",
    "the hard thermal loop resummation is to write an effective lagrangian @xmath4 which is the sum of the bare lagrangian @xmath5 and of the term @xmath6 containing all the hard thermal corrections @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears clearly that one needs to subtract counterterms in order to keep the overall lagrangian unmodified .",
    "basically , this procedure amounts to write @xmath7 that way , the htl resummation is just a mere reordering of the perturbative expansion , and the exact theory remains the same .",
    "counterterms have been used in @xcite for the two - loop plasmon mass .",
    "the subtraction of counterterms and the use of cut - offs are equivalent .",
    "this is illustrated on figure [ fig : cut - off ] , where we also represented the 1-loop and 2-loop contributions when the cut - off is removed , in the boldface boxes .",
    "obviously , their sum is much higher than the value of the plateau in the cut - off approach .",
    "this means that this sum includes some contributions twice , and that a counterterm is mandatory .",
    "counterterms seem more systematic since they come from a lagrangian formulation , while it can be tricky to use properly cut - offs in a situation with overlapping loops . in the following ,",
    "i follow the point of view based on counterterms .",
    "let me now give the precise relationship between the photon production rate and the thermal green s functions .",
    "the number of real photons emitted per unit time and per unit volume of the plasma is related to the retarded photon self energy via @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bose - einstein statistical factor .",
    "for photons of invariant mass @xmath10 subsequently decaying in a lepton pair , we have instead @xmath11 basically , the second formula differs from the first one by the allowed phase space , by the propagator @xmath12 of a massive photon , and by the coupling constant @xmath13 which appears in the decay into a lepton pair since they neglect any reinteraction of the emitted photon on its way out of the plasma . on the contrary ,",
    "they include corrections to all orders in the strong coupling constant . ] . the imaginary part of the retarded self energy appearing in the right hand side can be expressed as a sum of cuts through the corresponding diagrams @xcite .",
    "bremsstrahlung appears in the two - loop diagrams represented on figure [ fig : two - loop ] .     according to the discussion made earlier ,",
    "they should be accompanied by the 1-loop diagrams involving the proper htl counterterms .",
    "in fact , these two - loop diagrams contain much more than bremsstrahlung .",
    "for instance , if we consider a cut that goes through the gluon propagator , we can have bremsstrahlung if the gluon is space - like ( @xmath14 ) and corrections to compton effect if @xmath15 .",
    "concerning the counterterms , since their role is to avoid double counting , it is quite natural to associate them with the contributions coming from the @xmath15 region of phase space .",
    "indeed , the inner structure of the counterterm involves a bare gluon which contributes only in the time - like region once cut . another way to justify",
    "this is to say that the counterterms should be associated with terms that provide corrections to a process appearing already at a lower order .",
    "there is no point in associating counterterms with a process that appears in this order for the first time .",
    "therefore , counterterms will be calculated only if it appears that the @xmath15 region contributes at leading order .",
    "phase space considerations tend to make us favor a hard quark loop in order to enlarge its size as much as possible .",
    "therefore , we can drop at leading order hard thermal corrections involving the propagator of such a hard quark , and obtain a simplified version of the previous diagrams , which is represented on figure [ fig : two - loop - simple ] .",
    "more precisely , we will use the hard limit of the effective quark propagator , retaining that way an asymptotic thermal mass .",
    "this mass will be necessary later in order to regularize collinear singularities .",
    "other authors @xcite have found that the width obtained by an extra resummation including a self energy with an imaginary part in the time like region may compete with this asymptotic mass as a collinear regulator under certain circumstances .",
    "but since our goal was to follow strictly the htl approach , we did not consider this extension here .",
    "we have checked that the two cuts represented on figure [ fig : two - loop - simple ] form a gauge invariant set of terms .",
    "one should also add a second symmetrical cut to the vertex , and a second self - energy diagram in which the loop correction is on the other quark line .",
    "we can as well take them into account by just multiplying the result by an extra factor @xmath16 , since they provide contributions equal to those of the cuts already represented . applying the cutting rules for the retarded - advanced formalism @xcite gives immediately for the vertex contribution @xmath17    \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\times\\ ;    \\left[s^{^{r}}(p)-s^{^{a}}(p)\\right ]    \\left[s^{^{r}}(r+l)-s^{^{a}}(r+l)\\right ]    \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\times\\ ;",

    "it means that only the principal part of these propagators contributes .",
    "taking into account the identity @xmath29 , as well as the fact that certain terms will be killed later by the @xmath30 distributions , we can give the following expressions for the dirac s traces @xmath31\\ ; , \\\\    & & { \\rm trace}{}^{\\rho\\sigma}{}_{|_{\\rm vertex } }    \\approx    -4\\left[2{\\overline{r}}{}^2{\\overline{p}}{}^\\rho q{}^\\sigma      -2({\\overline{p+l}}){}^2{\\overline{r}}{}^\\rho q{}^\\sigma    \\right .",

    "since we may encounter collinear divergences , we need to keep carefully the asymptotic mass @xmath32 in this study . from the first cut propagator @xmath33",
    ", we obtain @xmath34 , where i denote @xmath35 , as well as @xmath36 .",
    "the second delta function constrains the angle @xmath37 between the 3-vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 , by @xmath40 at that point , we must impose that this cosine be between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which amounts to the following set of inequalities @xmath43 a convenient way is to see these inequalities as constraints in the @xmath44 plane in which they reduce the integration domain .",
    "the effect of this reduction is represented on figure [ fig : llo - reduc ] . on this figure ,",
    "regions shaded in dark gray are excluded by the inequalities [ hardconstraints ] .",
    "regions shaded in light gray are allowed and involve a time - like cut gluon propagator , which means that the corresponding processes correspond to compton or annihilation processes .",
    "regions in white are also allowed and correspond to the exchange of a space - like gluon .",
    "these regions will turn out to be dominant .",
    "the regions on which we focus mostly in the following have been labeled by i , ii and iii . looking at the signs of the quark momenta in each region , we can see that region i and iii involve bremsstrahlung processes , while a new process appears in region ii .",
    "this unexpected process can be described as a @xmath45 annihilation in which one of the fermions undergoes a scattering through a gluon exchange ( see the figure [ fig : processes - list ] ) .    by the change of variables @xmath46",
    ", we can map the region i on the region iii . as a consequence",
    ", the bremsstrahlung photon production can be obtained by looking only at the region iii , and multiplying its contribution by an overall factor @xmath16 .      when both the external photon and the internal quark are massless , the diagrams of figure [ fig : two - loop - simple ] display a collinear singularity when the 3-momentum of the quark is parallel to that of the emitted photon .",
    "moreover , contrary to the collinear divergences encountered in the 1-loop contributions , which are at most logarithmic , we have here two denominators that can vanish almost simultaneously .",
    "this is of course obvious for the second diagram of figure [ fig : two - loop - simple ] in which we have a double pole .",
    "but even for the first one , the poles are distinct but very close .",
    "indeed , @xmath47 is vanishing when @xmath48 is parallel to @xmath49 , while @xmath50 vanishes when @xmath51 is parallel to @xmath49 . as a consequence , when @xmath52 is soft , these two conditions of collinearity are satisfied almost simultaneously , independently of the order of magnitude of the momentum @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the two denominators have very close poles , and their association mostly behaves like a double pole .",
    "the collinear singularity of these diagrams is therefore quasi linear , instead of logarithmic .",
    "when the quark mass is taken into account , these divergences are regularized , but a consequence of their linear nature is the generation of powers of @xmath1 .",
    "the strength of these divergences makes dominant the terms that have this configuration of quasi double poles .",
    "it is rather straightforward to show that this can not occur when the gluon is time - like . indeed , because of the delta function @xmath53 , the denominator @xmath54 can approach zero only if @xmath14 for soft @xmath55 . and",
    "hard @xmath55 has in fact been studied by @xcite ( there is no contribution with @xmath15 in @xcite since they used bare gluon propagators ) . ] therefore , we consider only the regions where @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to check that in the collinear limit , for soft @xmath55 , the boundaries of region iii are just @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ the inequality @xmath57 does not add any extra constraint beyond @xmath58 .",
    "let me start with soft photons .",
    "i consider here photons having a small invariant mass @xmath59 .",
    "is in fact the condition on the invariant mass in order to have this collinear enhancement . ] in this situation , it is easy to verify that the contribution of region ii is subdominant , since the area of the phase space available to this process in the @xmath44 plane is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , for this region , the gluon momentum @xmath55 is necessarily hard , which implies that the two conditions of collinearity discussed above can not be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "therefore , bremsstrahlung is the only dominant process for the production of low invariant mass soft photons .",
    "using only the variables @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we can write@xcite @xmath66\\ ; ,    \\label{eq : r2}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , and @xmath68^{1/2}}}\\ ; , \\label{eq : pl2}\\ ] ] where we performed the integration over the azimuthal angle @xmath69 between @xmath49 and @xmath39 at this stage since this denominator is the only place where @xmath69 appears at the dominant order . among all the terms present in the amplitude ,",
    "the only ones to be sensitive to the collinear singularity described in the previous section are those where two of these denominators are present .",
    "other terms have a numerator that cancels one of the denominators , so that the collinear singularity is only logarithmic .",
    "on the basis of these considerations , it is easy to check that only the following term in @xmath70 @xmath71 is dominant .",
    "it is then straightforward to perform the angular integration over @xmath72 , to obtain the following expression of the imaginary part of the polarization tensor of the photon : @xmath73 where we denoted @xmath74 with @xmath75    a first noticeable feature of the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : im - pi ] ) is its order of magnitude .",
    "indeed , it is @xmath76 larger than 1-loop contributions calculated in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the strong collinear singularities described earlier .",
    "the quantities @xmath77 are coefficients quantifying the respective contributions of the transverse and longitudinal exchanged gluons .",
    "if we plot these quantities as a function of the parameter @xmath78 , we obtain the curves of figure [ fig : plotq ] .",
    "one can see that these coefficients are decreasing very fast if @xmath79 increases .",
    "this is of course due to the fact that the invariant mass @xmath79 attenuates the effect of the collinear singularities .",
    "what happens around @xmath80 will be presented in detail by h. zaraket elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "another feature of the result ( [ eq : im - pi ] ) is that it is totally free of any infrared divergence when the gluon momentum is going to zero , while one could have expected problems to occur with the transverse gluons ( see the problems encountered in the calculation of the damping rate of a moving quark , for instance ) . if we look formally at the limit @xmath81 of the quantities @xmath77 when @xmath82 , we find @xmath83 this result is interpreted as follows : the common power of the logarithm is due to the collinear singularity ( common to both the transverse and longitudinal gluon contributions ) which reappears when its regulator @xmath32 is suppressed .",
    "the reason why only a logarithm appears in this limit despite the fact that the singularity has been described earlier as quasi linear is precisely related to the fact that we do nt have exactly a double pole but two very close poles : the small separation between the two poles , which is responsible for extra powers of @xmath1 , does not go to zero when @xmath81 . in the transverse gluon contribution , there is an extra power of this logarithm which is interpreted as a remnant of an infrared singularity . to support this interpretation ,",
    "we can introduce by hand a magnetic mass @xmath84 in the effective gluon propagator , and look at @xmath85 this limit indicates the infrared nature of the extra logarithm in the transverse gluon contribution .",
    "equation ( [ eq : limits ] ) then tells us that the relevant regulator of this potential infrared singularity is the _ quark _ thermal mass when @xmath86 , which can be understood in terms of phase space constraints . indeed , if @xmath87 while @xmath88 , the delta functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 become incompatible with bremsstrahlung , which means that @xmath32 prevents the infrared singularity from having a support .",
    "the calculation of 2-loop contributions to hard real photon production follows closely what has been done before for soft photons , at least for @xmath82 , a condition to which i will adhere in the following .",
    "indeed , most of the aspects of the calculations were based on the fact that @xmath91 .",
    "simply , since @xmath49 can not be neglected in front of @xmath48 , one must treat more carefully the angles between the various 3-vectors of the problem .",
    "if we still denote by @xmath62 the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the angle @xmath92 between @xmath49 and @xmath39 is now given by @xmath93 where @xmath37 and @xmath69 are defined in the same way as before .",
    "then , it is easy to see that ( [ eq : r2 ] ) is unchanged ( except for the fact that @xmath94 becomes simply @xmath95 when @xmath82 ) , while ( [ eq : pl2 ] ) becomes @xmath96^{1/2}}}\\ ; . \\label{eq : pl2hard}\\ ] ] again , the only dominant term in the matrix element is given by ( [ eq : dominant ] ) , which makes easy the evaluation of the bremsstrahlung contribution to hard real photons .",
    "we now obtain @xmath97 { { [ n_{_{f}}(p)-n_{_{f}}(p+q_o)]}}\\ ; ,    \\label{eq : hardresult}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with now @xmath98 as one can see , the structure of the bremsstrahlung contribution to the production of hard real photons is quite similar to the case of soft photons . in the above expressions ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 have been defined to match exactly those which have been defined previously , when @xmath82 .",
    "the only difference is in the integration over @xmath63 which is now more complicated because we can not neglect @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath60 dependence that comes from this integral is non trivial now , but some limits are simple . in the limit @xmath99 , we recover of course the result given for the production of soft real photons .",
    "a simple result can also be obtained in the opposite limit @xmath100 , for which a simple expansion can be given for the integral over @xmath63 , which leads us to @xmath101    as said before , the contribution of region ii is negligeable only when @xmath60 is soft because of a small phase space , so that we must now take it into account .",
    "its evaluation in the asymptotic region @xmath102 is very easy . since @xmath103 in this region",
    ", we have instead of ( [ eq : r2 ] ) @xmath104\\ ; , \\ ] ] where i denote @xmath105 .",
    "we can also check that ( [ eq : pl2hard ] ) remains valid , except for the changes @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the enhancement due to collinear singularities in the terms that contains these two denominators is unchanged near @xmath108 . concerning the boundaries of the integration domain",
    ", we can note that the statistical weight @xmath109 is equal to @xmath110 for @xmath111 and equals @xmath112 everywhere else ( excepted in a small region of width @xmath113 where the transition from @xmath110 to @xmath112 takes place , but this provides corrections of relative order @xmath114 ) .",
    "for the @xmath64 and @xmath115 variables , the limits are @xmath116 and @xmath117 where the upper bound @xmath118 is always hard so that it can be taken to infinity without changing the result .",
    "therefore , the integration over @xmath115 and @xmath64 gives again the same factor @xmath119 as in ( [ eq : hardresult - asympt ] ) .",
    "since the integration over @xmath63 is replaced now by @xmath120 the contribution of region ii for @xmath100 is @xmath121 it appears that the process of this region , behaving as @xmath122 when @xmath100 , instead of @xmath123 for bremsstrahlung , is the dominant one for the production of extremely hard photons .",
    "the production rate of soft real photons has already been evaluated at 1-loop in thermal field theory by @xcite .",
    "the typical order of magnitude they found for the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor is @xmath124 , which means that the bremsstrahlung contribution found in ( [ eq : im - pi ] ) is larger by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "bremsstrahlung seems therefore to be the dominant process for the production of soft quasi - real photons .",
    "this extra @xmath76 factor can be traced back into the strong collinear singularity exhibited by bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "this effect can be seen as a breakdown of the effective expansion based on the resummation of hard thermal loops . indeed , the powers of @xmath1 generated by these collinear divergences can change the order in @xmath125 of a contribution , so that the usual connection between the number of loops and the order in @xmath125 is lost .    concerning hard real photons ,",
    "@xcite calculated in thermal field theory the contribution of processes involving a time - like gluon , like compton processes .",
    "their calculation involves both 1-loop and 2-loop diagrams , and leads to @xmath126 for @xmath100 , where @xmath127 is a numerical constant equal to @xmath128 .",
    "we are now in a position to compare the contributions given by bremsstrahlung , the @xmath45 annihilation appearing in region ii , and the compton processes calculated by baier et al . for this comparison , we take @xmath129 colors and @xmath130 light flavors , and a coupling constant @xmath131 . and for photon energies around @xmath113 , compton processes are actually dominant because of an extra factor of order @xmath132 . ] at @xmath82 , the quantities @xmath77 depend only on @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and are @xmath135 and @xmath136 with our choice of parameters . the evolution with the photon energy @xmath60 of these three contributions has been plotted on figure [ fig : comp - hard ] .",
    "we see that bremsstrahlung is dominating for the smaller values of @xmath60 , while the region ii becomes dominant for hard enough @xmath60 . for intermediate energies ,",
    "the three contributions are comparable .",
    "the sum of the three contributions is significantly above the compton contribution considered alone .      in his talk",
    "@xcite , flechsig presented results about the qcd plasmon frequency near the light - cone .",
    "this calculation is also plagued by very strong collinear singularities , very similar to those encountered in the real photon rate .",
    "a first sight , there is however a difference because the collinear singularities in the plasmon frequency arise already at one loop , and come from @xmath137 and @xmath138 effective vertices .    in order to make the connection between the present work and flechsig s approach , it is useful to note that at the level of the topologies , we have the following identity 1=to 8.1 cm @xmath139 between our diagrams and some 1-loop tadpole diagram .",
    "indeed , the tadpole contains both the self - energy and the vertex topologies since there are several terms contributing to the @xmath140 effective vertex , obtained by exchanging a photon and a gluon .",
    "of course , the tadpole vanishes when one takes the trace over photon lorentz indices , so that this equation does not reflect an exact algebraic identity between both sides ( one would need to calculate the tadpole beyond the htl approximation in order to be able to identify the two sides ) . despite this limitation , one can note that both sides have the same denominators and therefore the same singularities . as a consequence , we can interpret our singularities as being collinear singularities encountered in hard thermal vertices when some external legs are on the light - cone@xcite and conclude that the singularities encountered in our calculation are basically the same as those encountered by flechsig .",
    "the only difference is that the htl approximation makes the tadpole vanish when one traces it over the photon lorentz indices , so that we have to go to two loops .",
    "this remark suggests also a defect of the htl approximation .",
    "indeed , in the calculation of the tadpole of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tadpole ] ) the htl approximation gives a zero coefficient to otherwise extremely singular ( and large after regularization ) terms .",
    "therefore , it seems that the htl approximation is not a good one in the presence of these strong collinear singularities , because one would need to go beyond this approximation to retain the relevant dominant terms in the tadpole .",
    "photon production by a plasma has also been studied by semi - classical methods in @xcite",
    ". basically , in this approach , one studies the radiative energy loss of a fast quark undergoing multiple scatterings in a dense medium .",
    "the scattering centers are assumed to be static , which implies that the interaction is purely electric .",
    "this amounts to take only the longitudinal exchanged gluons into account . as a consequence , this interaction can be regularized by a debye mass , and one does not have to worry about infrared divergences . in order to exhibit the analogy between this semi - classical approach and the thermal field theory , it is possible to write the bremsstrahlung contribution as given by ( [ eq : rate ] ) in thermal field theory in the following form 1=to 5 cm @xmath141[1-n_{_{f}}(k_o+l_o)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\times2\\pi\\delta(p^2-m^2_\\infty)\\ ,    2\\pi\\delta((r+l)^2-m^2_\\infty)\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\quad\\times2\\pi\\delta(k^2-m^2_\\infty)\\ ,    2\\pi\\delta((k+l)^2-m^2_\\infty )    \\ ; ,    \\label{eq : lastform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 .",
    "this kind of formula looks like the starting point of the semi - classical approach , but it differs from it by some essential aspects .",
    "the most important one is that it includes the contributions of the transverse exchanged gluons , which we have shown to be quite important since @xmath143 is as large as @xmath144 .",
    "neglecting it does not appear to be a good approximation .",
    "moreover , this formula differs from the semi - classical ones by the details of how the debye screening is incorporated in the gluon propagator .",
    "indeed , the semi - classical approach just includes some constant debye mass as a regulator , while in thermal field theory one takes into account all the momentum dependence of the gluon self - energy via the htl resummation .",
    "although this does not change significantly the physics , it may affect the numerical value of the production rate .",
    "on the other hand , these simplifications allow the semi - classical method to handle more easily the multiple scatterings , and to show that some new collective phenomenon may appear .",
    "more precisely , multiple coherent scatterings may conspire in order to give a smaller photon production rate , a phenomenon known as the landau - pomeranchuck - migdal effect @xcite . in order to extract this effect from thermal field theory",
    ", one should look at diagrams with two and more exchanged gluons .",
    "in these proceedings , i have shown that 2-loop processes involving the exchange of a space - like gluon play a dominant role in the real photon production by a plasma .",
    "in particular , for the production of soft real photons , bremsstrahlung dominates over 1-loop contributions by a @xmath76 factor .",
    "therefore , this study reconciliates thermal field theory with the semi - classical approach .    from a more formal point of view",
    ", this phenomenon is due to very strong collinear singularities in these processes .",
    "although regularized by a thermal mass of order @xmath0 , an enhancement by a @xmath76 factor appears in the result as a remnant of these potential divergences .",
    "the possibility of such an enhancement can make certain contributions much larger than what one would have expected on the basis of their number of loops , therefore resulting in some kind of breakdown of the relationship between the order of magnitude and the number of loops .",
    "it would be very interesting to know if even stronger singularities can appear in higher order diagrams .",
    "there are also other motivations to look at higher order topologies .",
    "indeed , the lpm effect found in the semi - classical approach seems to indicate that equally important contributions come from the diagrams corresponding to photon emission induced by multiple scatterings .",
    "moreover , the study of the effect of the thermal width made by @xcite seems also to indicate contributions from higher order diagrams ."
