    "the prediction @xcite and first experimental observations @xcite of spin - transfer torques opened a new field in magnetism which studies non - equilibrium magnetic interactions induced by electric current . since such interactions are relatively significant only in very small structures , the topic is a part of nano - magnetism .",
    "the current - induced switching of magnetic devices achieved through spin - transfer torques is a candidate for being used as a writing process in magnetic random access memory ( mram ) devices .",
    "the mram memory cell is a typical example of a spintronic device in which the electron spin is used to achieve useful logic , memory or other operations normally performed by electronic circuits .    to produce the spin - transfer torques , electric currents have to flow through the spatially non - uniform magnetic configurations in which the variation of magnetization can be either continuous or abrupt .",
    "the first case is usually experimentally realized in magnetic domain walls.@xcite here we will be focusing on the second case realized in the artificially grown nano - structures .",
    "such spin - transfer devices contain several magnetic pieces separated by non - magnetic metal spacers allowing for arbitrary angles between the magnetic moments of the pieces .",
    "magnetization my vary within each piece as well , but that variation is usually much smaller and vanishes as the size of piece is reduced , or for larger values of spin - stiffness of magnetic material .",
    "the typical examples of a system with discrete variation of magnetization are the `` nano - pillar '' devices @xcite ( fig.1a ) .",
    "their behavior can be reasonably well approximated by assuming that magnetic pieces are mono - domain , each described by a single magnetization vector @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the unit vector and @xmath2 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation with spin - transfer terms.@xcite    it is often the case that magnetic pieces in a spin - transfer device have a strong easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "for example , in nano - pillars both the polarizer and the free magnetic layer are disks with the diameter much larger than the thickness .",
    "consequently , the shape anisotropy makes the plane of the disk an easy magnetic plane . in the planar devices @xcite built from thin film layers ( fig .",
    "1b ) the shape anisotropy produces the same effect . when the easy - plane anisotropy energy is much larger then all other energies , the deviations of @xmath3 from the in - plane direction are very small",
    "an approximation based on such smallness is possible and provides an effective description of the magnetic dynamics in terms of the direction of the projection of @xmath4 on the easy plane , i.e. in terms of one azimuthal angle . in this paper",
    "we derive the equations for effective in - plane motion in the presence of spin - transfer effect and discuss their use by considering several examples .    in the absence of spin - transfer effects",
    "the large easy - plane anisotropy creates a regime of overdamped motion even for the small values of gilbert damping constant @xmath5.@xcite in that regime the equations simplify further . here",
    "the overdamped regime is discussed in the presence of electric current .",
    "the reduction of the number of equations allows for a simple consideration of a spin - transfer device with two dynamic magnetic pieces .",
    "we show how an asymmetry in the sizes of these pieces creates a transition between the polarizer - analyzer ( `` fixed layer - free layer '' ) operation regime @xcite and the regime of nearly identical pieces where current leads not to switching , but directly to the slonczewski `` windmill '' dynamic state.@xcite finally , we point out the limitations of the overdamped approximation in the presence of the spin - transfer torques .",
    "magnetization dynamics in the presence of electric current is governed by the llg equation with the spin - transfer term .",

    "@xmath10 is the ( negative ) electron charge , so @xmath11 is positive when electrons flow into the magnet . due to",
    "the inverse proportionality to the volume @xmath12 , the larger magnets become less sensitive to the current and can serve as spin - polarizers with a fixed magnetization direction . as for the other parameters ,",
    "@xmath13 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath14 is the slonczewski spin polarization factor @xcite which depends on many system parameters , @xcite and @xmath15 is the gilbert damping which also depends on @xmath16 and @xmath17 when spin pumping @xcite is taken into account .",
    "we will restrict our treatment to the constant @xmath18 and @xmath15 to focus on the effects specific to the strong easy plane anisotropy .    in terms of the polar angles",
    "@xmath19 the llg equation ( [ eq : vector_llg ] ) has the form @xmath20 where the tangent unit vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined in appendix  [ appendix : vector_definitions ] .",
    "we will consider a model for which the energy of a magnet is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the easy - plane constant , @xmath25 being the `` residual '' in - plane anisotropy energy and @xmath26-axis directed perpendicular to the easy plane .",
    "the limit of a strong easy - plane anisotropy is achieved when the maximal variation of the residual energy is small compared to the easy - plane energy , @xmath27 . in this case",
    "@xmath28 with @xmath29 .    to estimate @xmath30 ,",
    "consider the motion of magnetization initially lying in - plane off the minimum of @xmath25 and neglect for the moment the spin - transfer terms in eq.([eq : polar_angles_llg ] ) .",
    "magnetization starts moving and a certain deviation from the easy plane is developed . for",
    "the estimate , assume that the energy is conserved during this motion ( the presence of damping will only decrease @xmath30 ) .",
    "then @xmath31 we can now linearize the right hand sides of equations ( [ eq : polar_angles_llg ] ) in small @xmath30 . on top of that ,",
    "some terms on the left hand sides of ( [ eq : polar_angles_llg ] ) turn out to be small and can be discarded . indeed , taking into account the smallness of @xmath15 one gets the estimates @xmath32 consequently @xmath33 and @xmath34 , therefore the second term on the left hand side of the second equation of the system ( [ eq : polar_angles_llg ] ) can be discarded .",
    "no simplification happens on the left hand side of the first equation , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be of the same order when @xmath37 .",
    "putting the spin - transfer terms back we get the form of equations in the limit of large easy - plane anisotropy : @xmath38 expressions for the scalar products in ( [ eq : polar_angles_llg_approximate ] ) in terms of polar angles are given in appendix  [ appendix : vector_definitions ] .",
    "the second equation shows that @xmath30 can be expressed through @xmath39 .",
    "small out - of - plane deviation becomes a `` slave '' of the in - plane motion.@xcite we get @xmath40 the term with the second time derivative @xmath41 decreases with increasing @xmath24 .",

    ", in the absence of spin - transfer this term can be neglected when @xmath42 .",
    "mathematically this corresponds to a transition from an underdamped to an overdamped behavior of an oscillator as the oscillator mass decreases .    with spin - transfer terms",
    "the overdamped approximation gives an equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",

    "[ fig : fixed_polarizer_stability]a .",

    "( [ eq : collinear_equation ] ) emphasizes the fact that spin - transfer torque destabilizes the equilibria by making the effective damping constant @xmath61 negative , while the equilibrium points remain a minimum of the energy @xmath25 .",
    "any appreciable influence of the current on the position and nature ( minimum or maximum ) of the equilibrium can only be observed at the current magnitudes @xmath62 times larger than the actual switching current.@xcite    second , consider the case of _ magnetic fan_.@xcite here the easy axis of the polarizer",
    "is again directed along @xmath47 , but the polarizer is perpendicular to the easy plane : @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "this arrangement is known to produce a constant precession of vector @xmath16 .",
    "( [ eq : overdamped_2 ] ) gets a form : @xmath65 for @xmath66 the current deflects the analyzer direction from the easy axis direction . for larger values of @xmath11",
    "there is no time - independent solution .",
    "the angles @xmath67 grows with time which corresponds to @xmath16 making full rotations . at @xmath68 the rotation frequency of the magnetic fan",
    "is given by @xmath69 .",
    "no let us assume that both magnets in fig .",
    "1a have finite size .",
    "each magnet serves as a polarizer for the other one . without approximations ,",
    "the evolution of two sets of polar angles @xmath70 , @xmath71 is described by two llg systems of equations @xmath72 where @xmath73 means the index not equal to @xmath74 and no summation is implied .",
    "we now apply the overdamped , large easy - plane anisotropy approximation to both magnets .",
    "equation ( [ eq : overdamped_2 ] ) for each magnet is further simplified since for the magnet @xmath74 the angle @xmath75 , @xmath76 . expanding ( [ eq : overdamped_2 ] ) in small @xmath77 and using the slave condition ( [ eq : polar_angles_llg_approximate ] ) for @xmath77 with @xmath78 expanded in both small angles ( see eq .",

    ". there are four equilibrium states that are stable without the current : two parallel states along the easy axis @xmath94 and @xmath95 , two antiparallel states along the easy axis @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "four more equilibrium states have magnetization perpendicular to the easy axis and are unstable without the current : @xmath98 . once again , since spin - transfer does not depend on the relative direction of current and magnetization , the configurations which can be transformed into each other by a rotation of the magnetic space as a whole behave identically .",
    "thus it is enough to consider four configurations : @xmath94 , @xmath96 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "we linearize equations ( [ eq : overdamped_llg_two_magnets_easy_axis ] ) near each equilibrium and search for the solution in the form @xmath101 .",
    "the eigenfrequencies are found to be : @xmath102 the state is stable when both eigenfrequencies are negative .",
    "we conclude that initially unstable states @xmath103 are never stabilized by the current , while the @xmath94 and @xmath104 state remain stable for @xmath105 these regions of stability are shown schematically in fig .",

    "[ fig : fixed_polarizer_stability]a ) which is recovered at @xmath106 .    as the size of the polarizer",
    "is reduced , the asymmetry parameter @xmath107 grows .",
    "the stability region of the antiparallel state acquires a lower boundary @xmath108 .",
    "up to @xmath109 , this boundary is still below the lower boundary of the parallel configuration stability region .",
    "consequently , the parallel configuration is switched to the antiparallel at a negative current @xmath110 .",
    "the system then remains in the antiparallel state down to @xmath111 .",
    "below that threshold no stable configurations exist , and the system goes into some type of precession state .",
    "this dynamic state is related to the `` windmill '' state predicted in ref .   for two identical magnets in the absence of anisotropies .",
    "obviously , here it is modified by the strong easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath109 value represents a transition point in the behavior of the system . for @xmath112 , the stability region of the parallel configuration completely covers the one of the antiparallel state .",
    "a transition without hysteresis now happens at @xmath110 between the parallel state and the precession state .",
    "if the system is initially in the antiparallel state , it switches to the parallel state either at a negative current @xmath110 or at a positive current @xmath113 , and never returns to the antiparallel state after that .",
    "we studied the behavior of planar spin - transfer devices with magnetic energy dominated by the large easy - plane anisotropy . the overdamped approximation in the presence of current - induced torque",
    "was derived and checked against the cases already discussed in the literature . in the new `` dynamic polarizer '' case , we found a transition between two regimes with different switching sequences .",
    "the large asymmetry regime is similar to the case of static polarizer and shows hysteretic switching between the parallel and antiparallel configurations , while in the small asymmetry regime the magnets do not switch , but go directly into the `` windmill '' precession state .",
    "we saw that the current - induced switching occurs when the effective damping constant vanishes near a particular equilibrium .",
    "this makes the overdamped approximation inapplicable in the immediate vicinity of the transition and renders eqs .",
    "( [ eq : overdamped_llg_two_magnets_easy_axis ] ) ill - defined at some points .",
    "however , the overall conclusions about the switching events will remain the same as long as the interval of inapplicability is small enough .",
    "we also find that the overdamped planar approximation does not work well when a saddle point of magnetic energy is stabilized by spin - transfer torque , e.g. during the operation of a spin - flip transistor .",
