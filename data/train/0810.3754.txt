    "we present first preliminary measurements of differential @xmath5 c jet and @xmath5 b jet cross sections using @xmath6 of data .",
    "these measurements were performed at the fermilab tevatron  collider at @xmath7 = 1.96 tev collected using the 0 detector .",
    "these measurements are differential with respect to the transverse momentum of the leading photon ( @xmath8 ) , the rapidity of the leading jet ( @xmath9 ) and of the leading photon ( @xmath10 ) . the results are presented in five @xmath8 bins and in two regions of photon ",
    "jet rapidities : @xmath11 ( region 1 ) and @xmath12 ( region 2 ) .",
    "events are recorded using the 0 detector  @xcite and must contain at least one photon candidate and at least one heavy flavor jet candidate .",
    "both the chosen photon and jet candidates are required to be leading with respect to their @xmath13 .",
    "the photon candidate @xmath13 must be greater than 30 gev , be located within the central calorimeter and have @xmath14 .",
    "the leading jet must have @xmath15 gev and @xmath4 .",
    "additionally , events must also contain a primary vertex within 50  cm of the detector s center along the beam pipe .",
    "this vertex is required to have at least three associated tracks , one with @xmath16 gev and a second with @xmath17 gev . to suppress events containing cosmic muons and w bosons , the missing transverse energy ( @xmath18 )",
    "must pass the condition @xmath19 .",
    "events are triggered using electromagnetic ( em ) clusters consistent with photon shower profiles .",
    "the final photon energy is taken as the energy of the cluster within a cone of radius @xmath20 .",
    "an isolation requirement is imposed on the candidate photon such that the total energy in a cone of @xmath21 , excluding @xmath22 , must be less than 7% of @xmath22 .",
    "the cluster must also have a probability less than 0.1% to be spatially matched to any track in the event .",
    "the cluster s transverse profile in the third layer of the em calorimeter must be consistent with that of a photon .",
    "the primary vertex is further constrained to be within 10  cm of the most probable origin of the photon candidate along the beam pipe . to further suppress backgrounds coming from jets , an artificial neural network ( ann )  @xcite , which uses additional single variable discriminants ,",
    "was employed with the requirement of ann @xmath23 .",
    "the energy of the leading jet is determined using 0 s runii jet reconstruction algorithm  @xcite with a cone of radius @xmath24 .",
    "heavy flavor jets are identified using their long lifetimes by reconstructing displaced secondary vertices from the jet s tracks .",
    "to best enhance the fraction of jets originating from heavy flavor quarks , an artificial neural network ( bann ) was implemented .",
    "the bann  @xcite uses variables characteristic of heavy flavor jets as inputs , trained such that the output of @xmath25 jets tends toward one and that of light ( udsg ) jets tends to zero . for this selection ,",
    "we require the bann output @xmath26 .",
    "to estimate the fraction of photons in the final data sample , the photon ann output in data is fit with a template from signal photon monte carlo ( mc ) pythia  @xcite simulation and a background dijet mc template .",
    "the fit is performed in each @xmath8 bin and in each photon - jet rapidity region separately .",
    "the fit results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pur_fit ] .     + heavy flavor jet events as a function of @xmath8 for both rapidity regions 1 ( left ) and 2 ( right ) .",
    "the result of the @xmath27 functional fit is shown by the full lines , together with the statistical uncertainty in the default fit ( dashed lines ) and the total uncertainty ( dotted lines).,title=\"fig : \" ]   + heavy flavor jet events as a function of @xmath8 for both rapidity regions 1 ( left ) and 2 ( right ) .",

    "it is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the probability of a track in the jet cone to originate from the primary vertex , omitting the track with the lowest probability .",
    "@xmath31has large values for @xmath25 jets and values closer to zero for light jets .",
    "a fit to the data @xmath31distribution is performed using mc templates for @xmath25 and @xmath28 jets , and the light jet template is taken from a light jet enriched data sample .",
    "the fit done in each @xmath8 bin , and to verify the quality of the fit , a combined flavor template is compared to the data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbjet_test ] .",
    "the differential cross sections are presented in five @xmath8 bins and two regions of @xmath32 , corrected for @xmath8 smearing effects due to the finite resolution of the calorimeter using the unfolding method described in  @xcite .",
