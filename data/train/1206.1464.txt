    "the study of the low - lying excited states of the @xmath0 isotones offers the best ground to describe the gradual filling of the active proton orbitals lying above the @xmath7 closure , since these states are free of any neutron contribution up to an excitation energy of about 4  mev .",
    "particularly , the description of the high - spin states mainly involve the effective interactions of the protons when occupying the valence orbits , particularly the high-@xmath6 ones , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , which can thus be tested .",
    "many years ago , a lot of low - spin states of several @xmath0 isotones were used to define the two - body part of shell - model hamiltonian  @xcite , which was adjusted some times later  @xcite using new data on some high - spin states of the  light ",
    "@xmath0 isotones produced by spontaneous fission of actinides  @xcite .",
    "this set of empirical interactions was then tested on the new high - spin states of @xmath4cs , identified in a deep - inelastic reaction up to i@xmath12=(31/2@xmath13 )  @xcite .    by combining appropriate fusion - fission reactions to a powerful @xmath1-detection array",
    ", it is possible to populate and to study the high - spin states of many @xmath0 isotones . in this paper",
    ", we present our results obtained on the high - spin states of five isotones , @xmath14xe , @xmath15cs , @xmath16ba , @xmath17la , and @xmath18ce , which have been identified in two euroball experiments .",
    "the level schemes of four of them have been well extended to higher - spin values .",
    "the high - spin structures of @xmath2la have been identified for the first time , displaying an isomeric state with @xmath5  ns located at 1800-kev excitation energy .",
    "the states of these five @xmath0 isotones are then compared to the results of shell - model calculations using the set of empirical interactions already used to describe the lightest isotones .",
    "in addition , groups of states lying above 4  mev excitation energy in @xmath3xe , @xmath4cs , and @xmath8ba are assigned to the excitation of the neutron core .",
    "the @xmath0 isotones of interest were obtained as fission fragments in two experiments .",
    "first , the @xmath19c + @xmath20u reaction was studied at 90 mev incident energy , with a beam provided by the legnaro xtu tandem accelerator . secondly , the @xmath21o + @xmath22pb reaction was studied with a 85 mev incident energy beam provided by the vivitron accelerator of ires ( strasbourg ) .",
    "the gamma - rays were detected with the euroball array  @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer contained 15 cluster germanium detectors placed in the backward hemisphere with respect to the beam , 26 clover germanium detectors located around 90@xmath23 and 30 tapered single - crystal germanium detectors located at forward angles .",
    "each cluster detector consists of seven closely packed large volume ge crystals @xcite and each clover detector consists of four smaller ge crystals @xcite . in order",
    "to get rid of the doppler effect , both experiments have been performed with thick targets in order to stop the recoiling nuclei ( 47 mg/@xmath24 for @xmath20u and 100 mg/@xmath24 for @xmath22pb targets , respectively ) .    the data of the ( c+u ) experiment were recorded in an event - by - event mode with the requirement that a minimum of five unsuppressed ge detectors fired in prompt coincidence .",
    "a set of 1.9@xmath25 three- and higher - fold events was available for a subsequent analysis .",
    "for the ( o+pb ) experiment , a lower trigger condition ( three unsuppressed ge ) allowed us to register 4@xmath26 events with a @xmath1-fold greater or equal to three . the offline analysis consisted of both multi - gated spectra and three - dimensional cubes built and analyzed with the radware package @xcite .",
    "more than one hundred nuclei are produced at high spin in such experiments , and this gives several thousands of @xmath1 transitions which have to be sorted out .",
    "single - gated spectra are useless in most of the cases .",
    "the selection of one particular nucleus needs at least two energy conditions , implying that at least two transitions have to be known .",
    "the identification of transitions depopulating high - spin levels which are completely unknown is based on the fact that prompt @xmath1 rays emitted by complementary fragments are detected in coincidence @xcite .",
    "moreover , the isotopes of interest being produced from two different fissionning compound nuclei , the complementary fragments are different in the two reactions .",
    "this gives a fully unambiguous assignment of transitions seen in both experiments .",
    "as reported in previous papers  @xcite , another experiment was performed using the saphir heavy - ion detector  @xcite , here composed of 32 photovoltaic cells , in order to identify new isomeric states in the fission fragments .",
    "placed in the target chamber of euroball , saphir was used to detect the escaping fission - fragments of the @xmath19c ( 90  mev ) + @xmath20u reaction from a thin 0.14 mg/@xmath24 uranium target .",
    "thus , all recorded @xmath1 rays emitted at rest by a fragment implanted in saphir correspond to the decay of an isomeric state , for which the half - life can be measured in a range of several tens to several hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath1 rays emitted by fusion - fission fragments do not show any anisotropy in their angular distributions with respect to the incident beam .",
    "however , angular correlations of two successive transitions are meaningful . in order to determine the spin values of excited states ,",
    "the coincidence rates of two successive @xmath1 rays are analyzed as a function of @xmath27 , the average relative angle between the two fired detectors .",
    "the euroball spectrometer had @xmath28=28441 combinations of 2 crystals , out of which only @xmath29 2000 involved different values of relative angle within 2@xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in order to keep reasonable numbers of counts , all these angles have been gathered around three average relative angles : 22@xmath23 , 46@xmath23 , and 75@xmath23 .",
    "the coincidence rate is increasing between 0@xmath23 and 90@xmath23 for the dipole - quadrupole cascades , whereas it decreases for the quadrupole - quadrupole or dipole - dipole ones .",
    "the theoretical values of several coincidence rates for the euroball geometry have been already given in previous papers  @xcite .",
    "the method has been checked by correctly reproducing the expected angular correlations of @xmath1-transitions having well known multipole orders and belonging to various fission fragments .",
    "the yrast states of @xmath4cs were obtained up to @xmath32  mev from the analysis of the @xmath33 cm spontaneous - fission study  @xcite .",
    "more recently a few transitions were added to this level scheme , using a @xmath34cf source  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the spin - parity values were only based on results of shell - model calculations .    in our work ,",
    "@xmath1 rays emitted by @xmath4cs are seen in the two fusion - fission reactions , with a slightly higher production in the ( c+u ) reaction compared to the ( o+pb ) one , especially for the high - spin states .",
    "the high - spin level scheme of @xmath4cs has been extended up to @xmath35  mev excitation energy and spin ( @xmath36 ) , thanks to the observation of about 25 new transitions ( see fig .  [ schema_cs137 ] ) .",
    "a 681-kev transition , already identified in the two previous experiments , is also oberved in our work , being located just above the 2783-kev level ( structure b ) .",
    "the coincidence relationships of this @xmath1 line involve the four yrast transitions , but we could not observe any transition located above the 3464-kev level , although the intensity of the 681-kev transition would have allowed us to see a higher - spin part of the cascade .",
    "this level is likely populated by several high - energy transitions which have escaped from our detection apparatus .",
    "we do not confirm two of the six new transitions above the 1893-kev level , which were proposed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite in addition to the previous level scheme  @xcite . the 2223.6- and 1609.4-kev @xmath1 rays",
    "are not observed in coincidence with the first yrast transitions .",
    "moreover the decay of the 3495-kev level toward the 3302-kev one by means of a 193-kev transition is not observed .",
    "the most noticeable information obtained in this work is the observation of two structures composed of low - energy transitions ( therefore presumably m1 ) located above the 4350- and 5452-kev levels ( structures c and d in fig .  [ schema_cs137 ] ) .",
    "the decays of their low - lying states are very fragmented and involve high - energy transitions .",
    "an example of double - gated spectrum showing the first transitions of structure d and its links to structure e is given in fig .",
    "[ spectre_cs137 ] .",
    "rays in coincidence with two transitions of @xmath4cs showing the first transitions of structure d in the low - energy part ( a ) and the links between structures d and e in the high - energy part ( b ) .",
    "the first gate is set on the 712-kev transition and the second gate is set on one of the four yrast transitions ( 1184 , 487 , 222 , and 890 kev ) .",
    "transitions emitted by @xmath37tc , the complementary fragments of @xmath4cs , are labeled by tc .",
    "the peaks marked with a star are contaminants .",
    ", width=321 ]    angular correlations of successive @xmath1 rays have been extracted for the most intense transitions of @xmath4cs .",
    "the experimental results are given in table  [ correl_cs ] .",
    "the three first results indicate that the transitions at 1184  kev , 487  kev , and 890  kev have the same multipole order , while the last one indicates that the multipole order of the 222-kev transition is different from that of the three others .",
    "an @xmath38 character is ruled out for the 222-kev transition , because the 1893-kev level would then be an isomeric state , with a half - life of a few tens to a few hundreds of ns , at variance with the fact that the 1184 - 487 - 222  kev cascade is not observed in the saphir experiment .",
    "thus the 222-kev transition is assigned to be a dipole transition , while the 1184- , 487- , and 890-kev transitions have an @xmath38 character .",
    "these arguments result in the spin values of 11/2@xmath39 , 15/2@xmath39 , 17/2@xmath39 , and 21/2@xmath39 for the levels at 1184 , 1671 , 1893 , and 2783  kev , belonging to structure b.    .coincidence rates between the low - lying @xmath1 rays of @xmath4cs as a function of their relative angle of detection , normalized by the ones obtained around 75@xmath23 .

    "only one experimental level is proposed at 2032  kev , which is close to the prediction of the 15/2@xmath40 state .",
    "the fact that the 15/2@xmath41 state was not populated in our experiment could be explained by its configuration,@xmath42 , which is different from the one of the states lying above it : the 17/2@xmath40 , 19/2@xmath41 , and 19/2@xmath40 states have the same configuration , @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to note that the experimental 21/2@xmath40 , 23/2@xmath39 and 25/2@xmath39 states are located at lower energies than the calculated ones , the deviations being @xmath29  100  kev ( table  [ e_exp_sm_139ba ] ) .",
    "this could be related to interactions between the states due to proton excitations among the @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbits ( belonging to the valence space used in the sm calculations ) and the states of structure c ( see fig .",
    "[ schema_la139 ] )",
    ".    finally , the states of structure c would be likely due to the breaking of the neutron core , as the corresponding states of @xmath4cs .",
    "nevertheless since the high - spin states having a broken proton pair in the @xmath11 orbit are predicted at lower energy than in @xmath4cs ( about 600  kev less ) , we expect large mixings of these two excitation modes in @xmath2la .",
    "this set of empirical effective interactions within the proton valence space including all the orbits of the 50 - 82 major shell describes well the yrast states of the five isotones studied in the present work , both the even-@xmath30 and the odd-@xmath30 ones .",
    "the deviations between experimental and calculated energies are mostly below 50  kev , that is well better than the values obtained for sm calculations using effective interactions derived from nucleon - nucleon potential , such as done for one prediction of the yrast states of @xmath4cs ( see table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the latter approach is broader since it can be used in all the valence spaces , thus it would be interesting to compare the numerical values of the two sets in order to find whether some particular tbme are at the origin of the better description and to understand why they would be unsatisfactorily calculated from nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "the neutron excitation of the doubly - magic @xmath44sn nucleus gives rise to its first positive - parity excited states : the multiplet from the @xmath45 configuration was measured in the 4 - 5 mev energy range , with spin values extending from 2@xmath39 to 9@xmath39  @xcite . in @xmath46te , states with higher spin values are obtained as this first neutron - core excitation can be coupled to the breaking of the proton pair  @xcite [ see the red circles in fig .",
