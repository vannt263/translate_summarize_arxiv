    "boundary conformal field theories ( cft ) have lately played an increasingly important role in statistical mechanics , condensed matter physics and string theory . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "they appear in most probabilistic applications of geometrical models ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent example ) , in particular through sle @xcite . in condensed matter",
    ", they contain all the information about fixed points in theories which are gapless in the bulk , such as kondo systems or edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect ( see @xcite for a review ) . in string theory , they provide for instance microscopic techniques to study d - branes in curved backgrounds @xcite . on top of this , the study of boundary aspects is a crucial component of understanding and classifying cfts at large @xcite , and has lately played a crucial role in the solution of non rational cfts @xcite .    while progress in understanding conformal boundary conditions for rational cfts has been considerable , the situation is not so satisfactory for non rational theories , which are however all too frequent in statistical mechanics applications .",
    "a case in point concerns the loop or cluster models , which  in one guise or another  are hidden behind most simple models of interest , such as @xmath10-state potts models , @xmath6 models , rsos models , polymers , and percolation .",
    "we are not aware of answers to most questions one might ask in this context , such as `` what are all the conformal invariant boundary conditions '' , or `` what are the partition functions for the @xmath6 models with neumann boundary conditions '' , etc .",
    "the origin of this difficulty lies in our lack of understanding of the bulk cfts , which exhibit non - rational , logarithmic features , and for which too little is known .",
    "bulk exponents turned out to be tractable thanks to the coulomb gas technique , but this technique has not been generalized to the boundary case with sufficient control yet ( see @xcite for recent progress in this direction ) .",
    "we put forward in this paper a proposal for what we believe are all the conformal boundary conditions of dense loop models .",
    "for each of those we determine the critical exponents , operator content and boundary partition functions , some of which have interesting probabilistic or geometrical interpretations .",
    "there seems to be much substance behind the results we uncover , and we hope to get back to the question in more details in the near future . in the present paper , we only present the leading arguments  which are based on previously published but unexploited results , as well as algebraic considerations  together with intensive numerical checks and some combinatorial proofs .    to help the reader , we now give a quick summary of our results and notations . the _ boundary loop model _ ( blm ) to be studied is defined on a tilted square lattice ( see fig .  [ vertices ] ) , wrapped on an annulus of width @xmath11 strands and circumference @xmath12 lattice spacings .",
    "loops cover all the edges , and interact in a specific way with the outer rim of the annulus , whereas they are simply reflected by the inner rim ( free boundary conditions ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the number of non contractible loops ( note that @xmath13 and @xmath11 must have the same parity ) .",
    "any loop has one of four weights ( @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ partfunct ] ) : @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) for a non contractible loop never touching ( resp.touching at least once ) the outer rim , and similarly @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath2 ) for contractible loops .",
    "we parametrize @xmath17 $ ] by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 real ) ; the model is then critical with central charge ( [ central ] ) for any real values of @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and is endowed with the @xmath20 quantum group symmetry .",
    "we further parametrize @xmath21 as in ( [ yloop ] ) .",
    "our central claim is that for any _ real _ @xmath4 , and any @xmath13 , there are two ( distinct for @xmath22 ) conformal boundary conditions : _ blobbed _ ( resp .",
    "_ unblobbed _ ) in which the outermost non contractible loop is required to ( resp .  required not to ) touch the outer rim of the annulus .",
    "( when @xmath23 the two cases coincide . )",
    "the spectrum generating functions in these two cases are ( [ specgenfunc ] ) , and the boundary conformal weights ( critical exponents ) @xmath24 are read off from ( [ kac ] ) .",
    "they combine to form the blm partition function @xmath1 through the amplitudes ( [ guess ] ) . when @xmath25 is integer , and when further @xmath26 the blm model can be related to an rsos model of the @xmath27 type with specific boundary conditions ( three columns of fixed heights , see fig .",
    "[ rsosconf ] ) through the rules ( [ rsosrules ] ) . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath1 can be written as a sum ( [ nicez ] ) over irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : blob ] we review the algebraic framework used in our study ( the blob algebra ) along with a few key results . in section  [ sec : blm ] we define the blm , classify its conformal boundary conditions , and give exact results for the associated critical exponents .",
    "two appendices present a rigorous result on the amplitudes of the transfer matrix eigenvalues .",
    "this is used in section  [ sec : z ] to write a number of exact identities  exact in finite size ",
    "relating @xmath1 to virasoro characters @xmath5 . in section  [ sec : neumann ] we discuss the case of neumann boundary conditions for the loop model , identifying in particular the neumann to dirichlet boundary condition changing field .",
    "the relations to rsos models are discussed in section  [ sec : rsos ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : cabling ] , we comment on the relation between the blob algebra and the theory of temperley lieb cabling .",
    "our conclusions  and the prospects for ( much ) further work  are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the temperley lieb ( tl ) algebra @xmath28 on @xmath11 strands is defined by the generators @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) acting on strands @xmath31 and @xmath32 and satisfying the well - known relations @xmath33 in @xcite this was generalized into the two parameter `` blob algebra '' @xmath34 , having an extra generator @xmath35 , and satisfying in addition the relations @xmath36     strands . ]    for @xmath28 it is well - known how to interpret these algebraic relations graphically in terms of the strands .",
    "the extra generator @xmath35 marks the leftmost strand by adding a `` blob '' to it ( see figure [ generators ] ) . in this graphical representation",
    "any completed loop may be taken out and replaced by its corresponding weight ( see figure [ blob ] ) .",
    "a loop with no blob gets the usual weight of @xmath14 , while a loop with a blob gets a modified weight @xmath2 .",
    "note that several blobs on the _ same _ loop reduce to a single blob .",
    "obviously , only loops touching the left border can be blobbed .     in the blob algebra @xmath37 on @xmath38 strands . ]",
    "this algebra has given rise to much work in recent years in the mathematical literature @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied in the context of boundary conformal field theory @xcite with results that have some small overlap with ours .",
    "( in @xcite this algebra is called the `` one boundary tl algebra '' , a name we shall not adopt . )",
    "the blob algebra is in fact a quotient of the more general affine hecke algebra ( like tl itself is a quotient of the ordinary hecke algebra ) .",
    "the representation theory of the two parameter algebra is richer than the representation theory of the tl algebra . for a given @xmath39 , and assuming first that @xmath40 is not a root of unity , exceptional cases occur whenever @xmath41 [ in the original paper @xcite this corresponds to @xmath42 in the basic equation @xmath43 . ]    in the case @xmath44 the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath45 ( the normalization guarantees unit sound velocity ) has been studied in the continuum most recently in @xcite where it was found * for any @xmath46 * to give rise to the generating function of scaled gaps , in the sector with @xmath13 non contractible lines acting on two non contractible lines at @xmath31 and @xmath32 is zero by definition . figure  [ blob ] has @xmath47 non contractible line running from the bottom to the top of the figure ( top and bottom are later wrapped onto an annulus ) . note also that @xmath13 and @xmath11 must have the same parity . ] propagating : @xmath48 here , as usual , @xmath49 is a virasoro generator , @xmath50 is the central charge for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ^ 2 - 1}{4p(p+1 ) } \\label{kac}\\ ] ] are the conformal weights of the kac table .",
    "moreover , @xmath53 .",
    "we stress that in ( [ nichols ] ) we have @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the standard modular parameter . as this meaning of @xmath7",
    "will be reserved for the argument of the spectrum generating functions , no confusion should arise with the _ other _ meaning of @xmath7 as the quantum group deformation parameter @xmath40 appearing in the parameterization of @xmath14 .",
    "the case @xmath56 of ( [ nichols ] ) is the usual hamiltonian for the loop model with free boundary conditions , since in this case @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", the generating function of scaled gaps has indeed been known for a very long time @xcite to be given by @xmath58 .",
    "the case @xmath59 as presented in @xcite appeared to be new , although it is in fact related to results in @xcite ( and has algebraic connotations in terms of representation theory of the blob versus the virasoro algebra ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss ( [ nichols ] ) further , interpret it in the language of the loop model , and correct it whenever necessary .",
    "we stress that the independence upon @xmath60 is a truly remarkable phenomenon : it can be interpreted by saying that once the algebraic structure of the hamiltonian is decided , the continuum limit does not depend on the ( boundary ) details . another way to view",
    "this independence is the following .",
    "the @xmath61 matrix of the loop model with spectral parameter @xmath62 , acting on strands @xmath31 and @xmath32 , can be written @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is easily found by solving the yang - baxter equations .",
    "writing similarly the boundary matrix as @xmath65 , the sklyanin ( or reflection ) equations relate @xmath66 and @xmath67 , giving rise to a solution for @xmath68 ( see eq .  (",
    "40 ) in @xcite ) that contains an arbitrary constant of separation @xmath69 .",
    "the arbitrariness of @xmath69 is analogous to the @xmath60-independence discussed above .",
    "and @xmath29 ) . left boundary vertices are always blobbed ( generator @xmath35 ) , and right boundary vertices are unblobbed ( generator @xmath70 ) . ]",
    "we now want to study the blob algebra in the context of isotropic dense loop models , which are described by a transfer matrix instead of a hamiltonian .",
    "we recall that in the bulk , these models are defined by dense coverings of the ( tilted ) square lattice with self avoiding and mutually avoiding loops , each vertex allowing two possible configurations ( see figure  [ vertices ] and also figures  [ clusters][cexi ] below ) , and each loop coming with a fugacity @xmath14 .",
    "what happens at the boundary is the subject of this paper .",
    "the sum over tl generators in the hamiltonian is replaced in that case by a product @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the integer part . by analogy",
    "we will supplement this by boundary contributions so the full transfer matrix reads @xmath73 in view of the @xmath60-independence of ( [ nichols ] ) , we would expect the critical exponents associated with @xmath74 to be independent of @xmath75 .",
    "this independence is checked numerically below ( see figure  [ fig : conj ] ) . from a geometrical point of view",
    "the most natural choice is then @xmath76 , so that after a trivial rescaling @xmath77 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a lattice model for which _ every loop _ touching the boundary gets a modified weight @xmath2 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "we will now study the conformal properties of this model ( which we call the _ boundary loop model _ ) , as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath2 .      the results from @xcite and",
    "more recently @xcite suggest the following .",
    "recall the parametrization @xmath78 ; for each @xmath79 we solve ( [ yloop ] ) to get @xmath4 .",
    "this gives a _ real _ number @xmath80 .",
    "the leading eigenvalue in the loop model transfer matrix with @xmath13 non contractible lines should scale with conformal weight @xmath81 . for when @xmath51 with @xmath19 integer and @xmath26 integer this is a rigorous consequence of @xcite and the loop - rsos correspondence , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : rsos ] below .",
    "-2.0 cm -1.0 cm -1.0 cm    figure  [ fig : conj ] serves the double purpose of checking this conjecture for @xmath23 and @xmath82 ( the ising model ) , and establishing the independence of the exponents on the choice of @xmath75 in ( [ tmlambda ] ) .",
    "the agreement with the numerics is generally very good , and even in regions with strong corrections to scaling ( in particular @xmath83 ) it should be noted that the finite-@xmath11 effects have consistently a trend and an amplitude compatible with the conjectured result in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the choice @xmath76 appears to minimize the amplitude of the finite - size effects , and accordingly we shall invariably adopt this choice for the subsequent numerical checks .",
    "another check , still for @xmath23 but with a higher value @xmath84 ( the tricritical potts model ) , is shown in figure  [ fig : conj2 ] .    from the point of view of the blob algebra",
    ", the parametrization ( [ yloop ] ) has nothing special compared with the other choice of sign in ( [ yloopsigned ] ) , which we rewrite here as @xmath85 of course by using symmetries of the sine function we can write as well @xmath86 so we see that the associated exponent reads as well @xmath87 , by the symmetry of ( [ kac ] ) .",
    "we now have to make things a little more precise and technical . the sector with @xmath13 non contractible loops",
    "can in fact be considered from two points of view , depending on whether or not the leftmost non contractible loop is allowed to touch the left boundary . in appendix",
    "a we discuss in details the sector structure of the transfer matrix @xmath88 of ( [ tm ] ) and show in particular that each of its eigenvalues corresponds to a definite choice : either the leftmost contractible loop is _ forced _ to touch the left boundary at least once , or it is _ forbidden _ from ever doing it .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to these two cases as the _ blobbed _ ( resp .",
    "the _ unblobbed _ ) sector . note that in both sectors the contractible loops to the left of the leftmost non contractible loop may of course still touch the left boundary .",
    "we claim that these two cases both correspond to conformal boundary conditions , which are different . for entropic reasons ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue in the blobbed sector is obviously greater than the largest eigenvalue in the unblobbed sector . from the above arguments , the blobbed sector therefore has the exponent @xmath89 indeed .",
    "the unblobbed sector meanwhile has a different exponent @xmath90 .",
    "this can be checked numerically , and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : l2check ] .",
    "note of course that when @xmath23 the two results actually coincide , as they should , since the two sectors are then identical .      the boundary loop model is closely related to the @xmath91 state potts model at coupling ( inverse temperature ) @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , ignoring first boundary effects , the potts model partition function can be written as @xcite @xmath93 the first sum is over bond percolation clusters consisting of @xmath94 bonds and @xmath95 connected components .",
    "the second sum is over loops on the medial lattice that separate the clusters and their duals , with @xmath96 being the number of loops and @xmath97 the number of potts spins .",
    "we have here supposed that the model is defined on a square lattice and stands at its critical temperature , @xmath98 .",
    "the equivalence between the cluster and loop formulations is obtained by applying the euler relation .",
    "note that the local configurations of the loops correspond precisely to the first two vertices of fig .",
    "[ vertices ] .    in the sector @xmath23",
    "we have claimed that the exponent of the boundary loop model is @xmath99 in the parameterization ( [ yloop ] ) .",
    "we now wish to check that this claim is consistent with known results on the potts model . to that end , consider the @xmath10-state potts model in the same annular geometry as the boundary loop model .",
    "denote by @xmath100 and @xmath101 two points on the left boundary , and let boundary spins on the interval @xmath102 be constrained to take a subset of @xmath103 states ( with @xmath104 ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath105 , this boundary condition corresponds to the potts spins being fixed on the interval @xmath102 and free on the remainder of the boundary .",
    "the modified partition function reads @xmath106 where we have used the euler relation as before . the number of clusters ( resp .",
    "loops ) that touch @xmath102 is denoted @xmath107 ( resp.@xmath108 ) , and obviously we have @xmath109 .",
    "we stress that @xmath95 and @xmath96 still denote the _ total _ number of clusters and loops .",
    "now , ( [ zcardy ] ) is a special case of the boundary loop model with the correspondence between weights @xmath110    in particular , for @xmath111 we have @xmath112 in ( [ yloop ] ) .",
    "the corresponding special case of our general claim is therefore that the operator that changes the potts model boundary conditions from free to fixed is @xmath113 .",
    "this indeed coincides with a well - known result of cardy @xcite .",
    "another verification is furnished by @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "the claim is then that the operator that changes the boundary conditions from free to mixed is @xmath116 with conformal weight @xmath117 .",
    "this is again a well - known result .",
    "further numerical study shows that the spectrum generating functions for the blobbed and unblobbed sectors of the boundary loop model are simply the characters of generic irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra , i.e. , respectively , @xmath118 this can be related with the structure of the basis of the blob algebra and the absence of truncation of the bratelli diagram @xcite .",
    "the precise finite - size definition of @xmath119 and @xmath120 in terms of the transfer matrix blocks @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( defined in appendix a ) . is given in ( [ app : chark])([app : decomp1 ] ) ; note that we have set @xmath123 in appendix b.    the leading behavior in these expressions defines the exponents @xmath24 and has already been checked in figs .",
    "[ fig : conj][fig : l2check ] above .",
    "the coefficients of the terms up to level 6 in the development @xmath124 have been verified by computing the first 32 eigenvalues of @xmath74 , for sizes up to @xmath125 , and looking for integer gaps in the spectrum of critical exponents . for definiteness",
    "we have concentrated on the case @xmath82 and @xmath126 .",
    "independent computations were made in the blobbed and the unblobbed sectors .",
    "moreover , the verification was made both for @xmath127 and for a generic value of @xmath2 , and in either case the absence of singular vectors up to and including level 6 was ascertained .",
    "it is important to stress that the spectrum generating functions are not given by ( [ nichols ] ) for the blm .",
    "the full loop transfer matrix actually contains more information , but can be truncated when @xmath4 is integer .",
    "we are now interested in the situation where the non contractible loops wrap around the annulus .",
    "the question then arises of which weight should be given to these loops ( while our results for the exponents have some overlap with @xcite , the following has never appeared before )",
    ". we will give in general the weight @xmath15 to non contractible loops that do not touch the boundary ( i.e. , the outer rim of the annulus ) , and weight @xmath16 to those that do ( there is at most one ) .",
    "we now claim that the full partition functions are given by adding sectors @xmath128 and @xmath129 with the following amplitudes .",
    "we parametrize @xmath15 , @xmath16 in terms of two numbers @xmath130 , @xmath131 : @xmath132 then the amplitudes are @xmath133    ) . ]    a complete proof of this statement is presented in appendix b. alternatively , we can argue that , because one can get from a sector @xmath13 to a sector @xmath134 by adding two non contractible loops at the right of the annulus ( here seen as a periodic strip ) , which can or not get contracted with the first @xmath13 ones , the generic amplitudes have to obey a recursion relation ( which has a deep algebraic nature , see @xcite ) .",
    "considering first the amplitudes @xmath135 for the simpler problem with transfer matrix @xmath136 ( i.e. , without the boundary generator @xmath35 ) one has @xmath137 with initial values @xmath138 and @xmath139 . a pictorial rendering of this relation is shown in figure  [ fig : trick ] .",
    "the solution reads explicitly @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the @xmath13th chebyshev polynomial of the second kind .",
    "turning now to the boundary loop model we must have similarly @xmath142 the initial values can then be determined to be @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , from which the general formulas ( [ guess ] ) follow .",
    "in addition to the actual proof of appendix b , we have checked ( [ guess ] ) by formal manipulations of transfer matrices up to size @xmath146 , along the lines of @xcite .",

    "the simplest situation occurs when @xmath149 that is , the parameter @xmath16 has the same formal algebraic relationship with @xmath15 that @xmath2 does with @xmath14",

    "when @xmath4 is even , the contribution from @xmath156 actually disappears .",
    "we thus get a sum over irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "we claim that the subtractions occurring in the partition function do occur in finite size as well .",
    "these subtractions involve the conformal weights @xmath157 and @xmath158 and correspond respectively to the blobbed sector with @xmath147 non contractible loops and the unblobbed sector with @xmath159 .",
    "in other words , we claim there are level coincidences in finite size between the blobbed and unblobbed sectors when @xmath4 is an integer : this in fact follows from the theory of representations of the blob algebra .",

    "the last two cases meanwhile require that @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",

    "an extensive numerical check of ( [ rsosrules ] ) is given in table  [ tab : rsos ] .",
    "we show all levels observed for the rsos model with @xmath146 and @xmath84 , along with the sector label @xmath173 , and we give the corresponding multiplicities of these levels in the loop model , where each sector @xmath174 is characterized by the number of non contractible lines @xmath13 , the blobbing of the leftmost string ( @xmath175 denotes the blobbed sector ) , as well as @xmath4 which determines the boundary weight @xmath79 through ( [ yloop ] ) .",

    "this apparent paradox is resolved by the fact that a given loop model sector contains in general extra eigenvalues ( not shown in table  [ tab : rsos ] ) which are not present in the rsos model .",
    "it should also be noted that the dominant eigenvalue in a given rsos sector is always observed to be dominant as well in the corresponding loop model sector ( [ rsosrules ] ) .",

    "one exception visible in table  [ tab : rsos ] is that the level @xmath176 is present in two distinct sectors , but since this is so both on the rsos and the loop side , definite labels respecting ( [ rsosrules ] ) can be assigned as shown in the table .",
    "another exception is the level @xmath177 which apart from its assignment to @xmath178 by ( [ rsosrules ] ) appears also in two more loop sectors , @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "this type of degeneracies can be explained by quantum group arguments .",
    "recall now that the character of the irreducible representation of the virasoro algebra with highest weight @xmath181 can be written as @xcite @xmath182 we wish to recover this character from the knowledge of the loop model partition function .",
    "this involves as usual an infinite series of additions and subtractions of sectors which is made possible in finite size by the quantum group symmetry .",
    "we suppose we are in the situation with heights @xmath183 .",
    "to go from @xmath184 on the left side to @xmath60 on the right side we need to sandwich between the left and the right the adjacency matrix of the @xmath185 diagrams so that a random walk on this diagram , from boundary to boundary , hopping from non contractible cluster to non contractible cluster , takes one from @xmath35 to @xmath60 .",
    "all the steps are identical with those in @xcite where partition functions with boundary conditions fixed at the leftmost and rightmost sides were computed .",

    "there are many ways to think of the blob algebra .",
    "we would like now to think of it within the theory of cabling , i.e. , tensor products of spin @xmath201 representations of @xmath202 .",
    "consider therefore @xmath203 representations of spin @xmath201 , and suppose we wish to project them on the maximally @xmath7-symmetric representation .",
    "the object doing this is the @xmath7-symmetrizer , whose expression is well known by induction to be @xcite @xmath204 with the boundary condition @xmath205 . here",
    "the @xmath206 are numbers given by @xmath207 and the @xmath208 are tl generators which obey ( [ tlalg ] ) as before and act on the tensor product of the @xmath31th and @xmath209th spin @xmath201 representation .",
    "these generators will not be identified with the ones used in the previous sections however ( see below ) .",
    "the first values are well known : @xmath210 , @xmath211 , etc .",
    "let us now add to our system @xmath212 `` ghost strings '' as in figure [ ghost ] ( labelled @xmath213 ) on which generators @xmath214 act , and let us symmetrize on these ghost strings and the first one of our system .",

    "@xmath222=0 $ ] for all @xmath223 .",
    "we can thus consider a modified version of the tl algebra where instead of the generators @xmath208 we have the modified generators @xmath224 .",
    "they obviously satisfy the bulk tl relations ( [ tlalg ] ) , since @xmath220 is a projector .",
    "moreover we now have the relations ( [ blobalg ] ) of the blob algebra , with @xmath225 and ( [ yloop ] ) .",
    "we have thus made the link with the foregoing discussion and shown that for @xmath4 an integer , the boundary conditions corresponding to the value ( [ yloop ] ) can be obtained by adding ghost strings on the left boundary and symmetrizing them with the first `` real string '' in the system .",
    "this should not come as a surprise : it is easy to show using pasquier s 6j calculations @xcite that the insertion of @xmath215 through the ghost strings construction translates into rsos language by having heights increasing linearly from the left hand side of the ghost strings up to the first height from @xmath226 to @xmath227 , and then because @xmath215 symmetrizes on @xmath4 strings and thus on the first real string as well , from @xmath227 to @xmath228 .",
    "this proves that the transfer matrix @xmath229 describes exactly the mixed rsos boundary conditions .",
    "note that one does not have to introduce the ghost strings .",
    "algebraically , the same would be obtained by replacing these @xmath212 strings by a spin @xmath230 ( in which case , @xmath231 identically ) .",
    "the operator @xmath232 then amounts to projecting the product of this representation and the first spin @xmath201 representation onto spin @xmath233 .    in this form , the identification was already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the formulas obtained in this section should match the ones which appeared in a recent paper by pearce et al .",
    "@xcite ; the derivation there is based on boundary integrability , and does not refer to the blob or boundary temperley lieb algebra , as far as we can see .",
    "in conclusion , it is important to stress that we have found a continuum of conformal boundary conditions for the dense loop models . how to incorporate them into a consistent conformal field theory remains an open problem .",
    "note that none of these boundary conditions involves the _ number of times loops touch the boundary _ , which would correspond somehow to modified spin - spin couplings on the boundary .",
    "rather , giving a different weight @xmath2 to loops touching the boundary can be interpreted in the @xmath6 model most easily as restricting the degrees of freedom on the boundary to take values in a sub manifold of ` dimension ' @xmath2 .",
    "this is not without reminding us of results in the wzw cases @xcite .",
    ".5 cm    the results described in this paper point to many further directions . among those",
    "are :    - geometric applications of the generating functions on the annulus    - derivation of the bethe ansatz equations and of the spectrum of scaled gaps    - extensions to the dilute case    - extension to the double boundary case    - study of boundary conditions in @xmath234 theories    we hope to report on these soon . to conclude",
    ", we now give one example of application .",
    "we consider the case @xmath235 , @xmath236 and the partition function with @xmath237 , @xmath238 ( i.e , .",

    "can be written as @xmath239 this is easy to interpret geometrically as the partition function of a gas of dense loops , all contractible , which are all constrained to touch the left boundary .",
    "the loops can also be replaced by trees . meanwhile , this partition function can also be interpreted in the symplectic fermion theory @xcite .",
    ".5 cm * acknowledgments : * h. saleur thanks i. kostov and v. schomerus for many interesting discussions , and for communication of their unpublished results @xcite .",
    ".5 cm * note added in proof : * after the completion of this work , i. kostov has studied ( in the preprint hep - th/0703221 ) the coupling of our boundary loop model to two - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "his results corroborate those presented here .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the construction and structure of the transfer matrix of the boundary loop model , corresponding to taking the limit @xmath240 in ( [ tmlambda ] ) .",
    "we recall the most general case of the boundary loop model , cf .",
    "[ partfunct ] .",
    "the model is defined on an annulus with the exterior boundary being distinguished .",
    "each loop touching at least once this boundary gets a weight @xmath2 if it is contractible ( i.e. , homotopic to a point ) , and @xmath16 if it is not .",
    "each loop that never touches the distinguished boundary gets a weight @xmath14 if it is contractible , and @xmath15 if it is not . for an annulus of width @xmath11 strands ( we assume @xmath11 even ) and circumference @xmath12 , this defines a partition function @xmath241 which can be expressed in terms of the @xmath12th power of the transfer matrix @xmath242 , where @xmath74 is given in terms of tl generators by ( [ tm ] ) , and the generators @xmath35 , @xmath29 obey the blob algebra @xmath243 defined by ( [ tlalg])([blobalg ] ) .    for simplicity",
    "we henceforth represent the annulus as a rectangle of width @xmath11 and height @xmath12 , with periodic boundary conditions identifying its top and bottom sides .",
    "the distinguished boundary is taken to be the left side .",
    "the transfer matrix then acts on states which can be depicted graphically as fully - packed non - crossing link patterns within a slab bordered by two horizontal rows , each of @xmath11 points .",
    "a link joining the top and the bottom row is called a _ string _ , and any other link is called an _",
    "arc_. the action of a word in @xmath244 on a state is obtained by adjoining the word to the top row of the slab ( i.e. , time propagates upwards ) .",
    "the 20 possible states for @xmath245 are represented in fig .",
    "[ app : states ] .",
    "note that links touching a point on the left boundary are necessarily blobbed ( shown by a circle in fig .",
    "[ app : states ] ) . only links up to and including the leftmost string can be blobbed .",
    "the states can be ordered as follows : first we sort the states according to a decreasing number of strings @xmath13 . for fixed @xmath22",
    ", we place first the states in which the leftmost string is unblobbed . and",
    "finally we group together states with fixed @xmath13 and fixed blobbing of the leftmost string , according to the link / arc configuration of the lower row of the slab .",
    "this gives the order of the rows of fig .",
    "[ app : states ] .",
    "the ordering of states within each row is according to the link / arc configuration of the upper row of the slab .    with this ordering of the states",
    ", @xmath74 has a blockwise lower triagonal structure , with each block corresponding to a group of states as defined above .",
    "the reason is that acting by @xmath29 can annihilate two strings ( if their positions on the top side of the slab are @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) but can not create any strings . likewise , acting by @xmath35 can blob the leftmost string , but it can not subsequently be unblobbed .",
    "the triagonal structure implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath74 are the union of eigenvalues of the blocks on its diagonal .",
    "moreover , blocks differing only by the configuration of the bottom row are identical . for the purpose of studying only the spectrum of @xmath74 the bottom row",
    "can therefore be completely forgotten , leading to a much smaller transfer matrix .",
    "indeed let us define a _ reduced state _ as a non - crossing link pattern on @xmath11 points .",
    "a ( full ) state can be turned into a pair of reduced states by cutting each of its strings and pulling apart the upper and lower parts . for convenience , a cut string will still be called a string with respect to the reduced state . for @xmath245",
    "there are 8 reduced states , shown in fig .",
    "[ app : red_states ] .",
    "the blocks on the diagonal of @xmath74 are denoted @xmath122 and @xmath121 , where @xmath13 is the number of strings , and the presence ( resp .",
    "absence ) of the asterisk ( @xmath175 ) indicates that the leftmost link is blobbed ( resp .",
    "unblobbed ) .",
    "note that the blocks @xmath122 and @xmath121 can be constructed in terms of the reduced states .",
    "the numerical studies of the spectral properties of @xmath74 reported in this paper were done by diagonalizing these blocks in the basis of reduced states .",
    "their dimensions read ( see appendix b for proofs of closely related statements ) @xmath246    with the terminology being fixed , the annulus partition function can now be written as @xcite @xmath247 here , the right vector @xmath248 is the unit vector corresponding to the state with @xmath11 strings .",
    "the left vector @xmath249 is obtained by identifying the top and bottom rows for each state ; counting the number of loops of each type ( contractible or not , blobbed or not ) gives the corresponding weight as a monomial in @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , with @xmath245 and the ordering of the states shown in fig .",
    "[ app : states ] , we have @xmath250",
    "the goal of this appendix is to provide a rigorous combinatorial proof of the amplitude formulae ( [ guess ] ) by generalizing the working of @xcite .",
    "the discussion assumes knowledge of the transfer matrix blocks @xmath122 and @xmath251 defined in appendix a.    following @xcite , we introduce the _ characters _ @xmath252 where we stress that the trace is over _ reduced _ states .",
    "also , let @xmath253 ( resp .",
    "@xmath254 ) be the annulus partition function constrained to have exactly @xmath196 unblobbed non contractible loops ( resp .",
    "@xmath255 unblobbed and @xmath70 blobbed non contractible loops ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath253 ( resp .",
    "@xmath254 ) consists of the terms in the full partition function @xmath241 whose @xmath256 dependence is @xmath257 ( resp .",
    "@xmath258 ) .",
    "the goal is to search for a decomposition of the form @xmath259 \\ ,",
    "\\nonumber \\\\",
    "z_j^\\ast & = & \\sum_{k = j}^{n/2 } \\left [ d^{(j)\\ast}_k l^{2k } k_k + d^{(j)\\ast}_{k\\ast }     l^{2k-1 } m k_k^\\ast \\right ] \\ , , \\label{app : decomp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 are coefficients to be determined . in the notation of ( [ guess ] )",
    "we have then @xmath264 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "d_{2j } & = & \\sum_{i=0}^j \\left [ d^{(i)}_j l^{2i } + d^{(i)\\ast}_{j } l^{2i-1 } m \\right ]   \\label{app : decomp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath265 .    rather than solving directly for the decomposition of @xmath253 in terms of @xmath266 ,",
    "the idea @xcite is now to turn the problem upside down and look for the decomposition of @xmath266 in terms of @xmath253 : @xmath267    the determination of the coefficients @xmath268 can be turned into a combinatorial counting problem as follows .",
    "first , recall that @xmath266 and @xmath269 were defined as _ traces _ over restricted states ( in contradistinction to the partition function which , as we have seen in ( [ app : partfunc ] ) , is more complicated than just a trace ) .",
    "we must now determine how many times each @xmath253 and @xmath254 occurs within a given trace .",
    "consider therefore some configuration @xmath270 on the annulus that contributes to ( say ) @xmath253 ( i.e. , has @xmath196 non contractible unblobbed loops ) .",
    "an example with @xmath271 and @xmath272 is shown in fig .",
    "[ app : compstate]a .",
    "it is convenient to not represent the contractible loops within the configuration , i.e. , to depict it as a state .",
    "this configuration will contribute to the trace only over such restricted states @xmath273 that are left _",
    "invariant _ by the action of the configuration .",
    "therefore , @xmath273 must contain the same arcs as does @xmath270 in its top row ( see fig .",
    "[ app : compstate]b ) .",
    "it suffices therefore to determine the parts of @xmath273 which connect onto the starting points of the @xmath196 non contractible loops ( see fig .",
    "[ app : compstate]c ) .",
    "since the goal is to determine the contribution to ( say ) @xmath266 , precisely @xmath274 strings and @xmath275 arcs must be used .    with this in mind , the coefficients @xmath268 are then determined as the following counting problems . in all cases , construct a reduced state on @xmath196 strands , using @xmath274 strings and @xmath275 arcs .",
    "further :    * for @xmath276 , all strings are unblobbed , but the _ exterior _ arcs to the left of the first string may be blobbed . * for @xmath277 ,",
    "the problem is the same , except that the leftmost string must be blobbed .",
    "but evidently this leads to the same counting , and so @xmath278 . * for @xmath279 , the leftmost strand becomes blobbed ( since we are considering a contribution from @xmath254 ) , and so must connect onto a blobbed object ( arc or string ) .",
    "but as the strings are unblobbed ( since we are considering a contribution from @xmath266 ) , it follows that the leftmost object is a blobbed arc . * for @xmath280 , the leftmost object ( arc or string ) as well as the leftmost string must be blobbed .",
    "these counting problems are easily solved using generating function techniques . as a warmup ,",
    "consider the counting of restricted states made up of only arcs .",
    "associate to each _ pair _ of sites an activity @xmath281 .",
    "a state is either empty , or has a leftmost arc which divides the space into two parts ( inside the arc and to its right ) each of which can accommodate an independent arc state .",
    "the generating function @xmath282 therefore satisfies @xmath283 ^ 2 $ ] with regular solution @xmath284 the coefficients are the celebrated catalan numbers @xmath285 .",
    "consider next states made up of only arcs , but in which exterior arcs may ( but need not ) be blobbed .",
    "call the generating function @xmath286 .",
    "if the state is non - empty , the leftmost arc is necessarily exterior .",
    "inside it are @xmath282 states , and to its right @xmath286 states .",
    "thus , @xmath287 , or @xmath288    we can now attack the case of @xmath276 .",
    "since there are @xmath274 strings ( all unblobbed ) , all of which divide the space into independent parts , the generating function reads @xmath289^{2k } = \\sum_{n = k}^\\infty { 2n     \\choose n - k } z^n\\ ] ] and we infer that @xmath290 .",
    "finally , for @xmath280 we must distinguish between the cases where the leftmost object is an arc or a string .",
    "this gives the generating function @xmath293^{2k }              = \\sum_{n = k}^\\infty { 2n-1 \\choose n - k } z^n\\ ] ] whence @xmath294 .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that @xmath295 it is easily checked that this system of equations is invertible , and after some straightforward manipulations the @xmath253 and @xmath254 can be isolated . in the notation of ( [ app : decomp1 ] )",
    "the solution reads @xmath296 applying ( [ app : decomp2 ] ) then finally leads to ( [ guess ] ) .",
