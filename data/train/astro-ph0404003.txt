    "globular clusters provide valuable snapshots of the formation history of galaxies and their large sizes and luminosities make them the most readily observable sub - galactic constituents . in addition ,",
    "globular clusters exhibit surprisingly uniform properties that suggests a common formation mechanism .",
    "they are well - fit by single - mass , isotropic king models @xcite , which describe clusters in terms of scale radii , central surface brightness , and core velocity dispersion .",
    "detailed studies of globular clusters in our galaxy have shown that in fact they only inhabit a narrow range of the parameter space available to king models @xcite and other globular cluster systems in the local group also appear to approximately follow the same relations @xcite .",
    "these parameter correlations trace a globular cluster fundamental plane that is analogous to , but distinct from , the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "globular cluster studies that include internal kinematics have been confined to the local group due to the faint apparent magnitudes of more distant extragalactic globular clusters .",
    "these studies have therefore only included the globular cluster systems of spiral and dwarf galaxies and not the globular cluster systems of large ellipticals . yet",
    "the globular cluster systems of ellipticals are a particularly interesting regime as they probe both a new morphological type and one likely to have exhibited a different and more complex formation history .",
    "the globular cluster systems of elliptical galaxies , as well as many spirals such as our own , have bimodal color distributions suggestive of multiple episodes of formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models for the formation of these globular cluster systems posit that one of these populations may be the intrinsic population of the galaxy and subsequent mergers resulted in the second population either as the result of a new episode of globular cluster formation @xcite or accretion of globular cluster systems from other galaxies , including accretion of globular clusters by tidal stripping from other members of a cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "ngc  5128 ( centarus  a ) , as the nearest large elliptical galaxy , is arguably the best source for extending detailed globular cluster studies outside of the local group .",
    "while ngc  5128  is the central galaxy of a large group , rather than a giant elliptical in a cluster , it likely had a similar formation history to its larger cousins .",
    "the most relevant similarity is the strong evidence for a recent , gas - rich merger ( for a recent review of ngc  5128  see * ? ? ?",
    "estimates of the size of the ngc  5128  globular cluster population suggest that it has a total of @xmath2 clusters , approximately a factor of 3 more than the entire local group @xcite .",
    "simple scaling arguments suggest that ngc  5128  should possess a number of extremely massive globular clusters and therefore is not only a good target for study of the globular cluster system of an elliptical galaxy , but also for study of how well the fundamental plane relations established locally apply to more massive globular clusters .",
    "a recent photometric and spectroscopic study of ngc  5128  by @xcite concluded that the metal - rich globular clusters may have a mean age of @xmath3 gyr , while an analysis of their photometric data yields a metallicity range of @xmath4 through @xmath5 @xcite    the most massive globular clusters can also be used to explore connections between the formation processes for star clusters and galaxies . while fundamental plane studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) clearly illustrate a significant mass gap between the most massive galactic globular clusters and the least massive dwarf galaxies , there have been encroachments into this gap from both sides . for many years",
    ", studies have speculated that at least some globular clusters may be the remains of tidally - stripped dwarf galaxy nuclei @xcite .",
    "two of the most massive globular clusters in the local group , @xmath6cen in our galaxy and g1 in m31 , have been interpreted as the nuclei of tidally stripped dwarfs @xcite . from the galaxy side , recent studies of nucleated dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite and ultracompact dwarf galaxies in the fornax cluster @xcite",
    "show some similarities between these least - massive galaxies and the most massive globular clusters .",
    "this mass gap may thus reflect the scarcity of the most massive globular clusters and the difficulty of kinematic measurements for the least massive , lowest surface - brightness dwarf galaxies , rather than a physical separation .    in this paper",
    "we present velocity dispersion measurements for 14 globular clusters in ngc  5128 .",
    "these globular clusters were selected from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) study of @xcite and therefore have well - measured structural parameters .",
    "these data are combined to estimate masses for these clusters , masses that are among the largest known for any star clusters and comparable to the nuclei of the lowest - mass galaxies . in the next sections we describe the observations , data processing , and velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "analysis of these measurements is described in  5 and the potential link between star clusters and galaxies is explored in  6 .",
    "our results are summarized in the final section . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the distance of @xmath7 mpc for ngc  5128  determined by @xcite from the brightness of the tip of the red giant branch and the mira period - luminosity relation .",
    "spectra of 14 globular clusters in ngc  5128  were obtained in the course of seven nights in march 2003 with the mike echelle spectrograph @xcite and the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope at las campanas observatory ( see table  [ tbl : obs ] ) .",
    "mike is a double echelle spectrograph capable of resolution @xmath8 on the red side when used with the @xmath9 slit selected for these observations .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity resolution fwhm of 15.8 km s@xmath0  or @xmath10 km s@xmath0 .",
    "mike was located at the east nasmyth port but not directly attached to the instrument rotator .",
    "the advantage of this configuration is that the instrument is gravity invariant and therefore potential calibration difficulties due to instrument flexure are completely avoided .",
    "the disadvantage of this configuration is that targets could not be observed at the parallactic angle and that they rotate with respect to the spectrograph slit . in any event , this configuration was the only one available at the time .",
    "to minimize lost light due to atmospheric dispersion , the position angle of the spectrograph was set to correspond to the parallactic angle for an object at airmass 1.3 ; below airmass @xmath11 the atmospheric dispersion correction is effectively negligible and most of our observations took place in this airmass range .",
    "any lost light due to atmospheric dispersion is unlikely to significantly impact our velocity dispersion measurements as the velocity dispersion gradient of the clusters is not large .",
    "the rotation of the slit also has a negligible impact as all of these globular clusters are fairly round @xcite .",

    "table  [ tbl : obs ] lists all 14 clusters according to their identification in @xcite , along with their apparent @xmath28 magnitude from @xcite , the total integration time , and the average snr per pixel over the wavelength range 5000  6800   when binned to 0.2   pixel@xmath0 .",
    "the total integration time listed is the sum of an integer number of 1800 s exposures .",
    "this exposure time was chosen to facilitate cosmic ray removal , yet also avoid a significant contribution from detector noise .",
    "spectra of 16 velocity dispersion templates were also obtained , ranging in spectral type from g through m stars and luminosity classes from iv through i. these templates were observed in a similar manner to the globular clusters .",
    "typically three integrations of a few seconds each were obtained for each template .",
    "arc lamps for wavelength calibration were obtained before or after the observations of each target .",
    "several sets of flatfield exposures using a quartz lamp were also obtained over the course of the seven - night observing run .",
    "the data were processed with a combination of tasks from the iraf echelle package and the sky - subtraction software described by @xcite .",
    "all images were overscan - subtracted and a simple cosmic - ray cleaning algorithm was applied to the individual cluster exposures .",
    "the images were also rotated such that the dispersion direction was approximately parallel to the rows of the detector .",
    "inspection of the several sets of flatfield exposures obtained over the course of the run showed no measurable variation and all of the flatfield exposures were therefore summed to produce one master flatfield .",
    "this flat was then normalized with low - order fits to each order and divided into all of the object exposures prior to sky subtraction .",
    "sky subtraction of mike data is complicated by the nonlinear transformation between the orthogonal ( dispersion , spatial ) and `` natural '' detector ( row , column ) coordinate systems and the slight undersampling of the data .",
    "the marginally undersampled sky lines are tilted with respect to the detector coordinate system and this tilt angle varies as a function of spatial position . as discussed in detail by @xcite ,",
    "the classical approach of rectifying and rebinning the image prior to sky subtraction can result in significant residuals in the case where the sky lines are critically- or undersampled .",
    "superior sky subtraction can be obtained if a sky model is calculated and subtracted prior to any rectification and rebinning of the data .",
    "the key to this technique is to calculate the transformation between the array coordinates @xmath29 and the orthogonal dispersion and spatial coordinate system @xmath30 . by collapsing the spectrum along the spatial coordinate @xmath31 , the profile of each sky line",
    "can then be measured as a function of the coordinate @xmath32 in which the sky line is well - sampled ( due to the tilt of the observed spectrum ) .",
    "a two - dimensional sky model can then be constructed with the same pixelization as the original data , thus avoiding the residuals that result from rebinning marginally or undersampled data . to employ kelson s method , we first calculated the transformation @xmath33 with his getrect command , using a flatfield frame to trace the boundaries of each order .",
    "these boundaries were defined with findslits ( treating them as individual slits in a multislit mask ) .",
    "we then calculated @xmath34 with getrect applied to each order .",
    "accurate calculation of this transformation requires several lines per order . as there are few airglow lines in the higher orders ( shorter wavelengths ) , we created a composite image of spectroscopic lines by combining a very high snr sky frame ( calculated by summing a large number of our exposures of the fainter clusters ) with thar and near lamp spectra . as many thar lines saturated in the 13 reddest orders , these orders were masked out before construction of the composite line image for getrect .",
    "a sky model image for each globular cluster exposure was then calculated with skyrect and subtracted from the flatfielded data .",
    "observations of the template stars were sufficiently short that no sky subtraction was deemed necessary .",
    "the dispersion solution was calculated with the ecidentify task in the iraf echelle package and thar lamp spectra .",
    "although most of the reddest orders were saturated by bright lines as described above , a combination of multiple lines in the bluer orders and several unsaturated lines in the redder orders led to a good solution ( rms @xmath35 0.005  0.007  ) with a fourth - order legendre polynomial in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "all of the object spectra were then extracted with apall .",
    "because most of the individual cluster spectra were too faint for a good trace , particularly in the bluest orders , we used a reference trace from a brighter object .",
    "this trace was recentered based on the centroid of the cluster trace in the reddest , highest snr orders .",
    "each individual exposure was extracted in this manner as several - pixel shifts were observed between a small number of the multiple exposures on individual clusters .",
    "the width of the spectral extraction window was 9 pixels or 2.6@xmath38 .",
    "the arc lamp was extracted for each object with the same trace and the dispersion solution was calculated with the ecreidentify task .",
    "the spectra were then placed on a linear wavelength scale with the dispcor task for measurement of their line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath39 .",
    "template stars and the flux standard hr  1544 were extracted in a similar manner .",
    "orders 68  39 of c23 , the cluster with the highest snr , are shown in figure  [ fig : c23 ] .",
    "the calcium triplet region ( order 40 ) is shown for all 14 clusters in figure  [ fig : cat ] .",
    "no correction for telluric absorption was applied to these data .",
    "the two most commonly employed techniques for velocity dispersion measurement are direct - fitting in pixel space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cross - correlation techniques in the fourier domain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after experiments with both techniques we chose the cross - correlation method developed in detail by @xcite as implemented by the rvsao package @xcite in iraf .",
    "the main advantage of the cross - correlation function ( hereafter ccf ) is that it is less sensitive to the relative line strengths in the targets and templates .",
    "this is likely to be the case for the present study due to metallicity differences between the globular clusters and the galactic template stars observed .",
    "trial implementations of direct - fitting in pixel space confirmed that most of the stellar templates are not good matches in detail to these globular clusters .",
    "direct pixel - fitting did show that the observed stellar templates with spectral types between g8 and k3 were the best matches to the globular cluster spectral energy distributions .",
    "the stellar templates used for this study are : hd  80499 ( g8iii ) , hd  95272 ( k0iii ) , hd  88284 ( k0iii ) , hd  43827 ( k1iii ) , hd  92588 ( k1iv ) , hd  44951 ( k3iii ) , and hd  46184 ( k3iii ) .",
    "the first step in implementation of the ccf technique is the calculation of the relation between the ccf width and the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath39 . to measure this relationship , we convolved a range of the observed stellar templates by gaussian functions with @xmath40 [ 5,7,10,14,20,28,40,56 ] km s@xmath0and used a simple spline fit to calculate the relation between ccf width and input @xmath39 .",
    "we calculated this relationship for each of the spectroscopic orders and determined that the uncertainty in @xmath39 measurements in orders with significant telluric absorption ( 50 , 48 , 47 , 45 , 42 , and 41 ) was considerably higher than those without . given the large number of orders available , these orders were excluded from subsequent analysis .",
    "based on measurements from the remaining orders we determined that all of the globular clusters have @xmath39 in the approximate range of 10  30 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity dispersions of these clusters are thus well - resolved by this instrument configuration .    while the ccf technique is known to be relatively insensitive to template mismatch , we tested the importance of this potential source of systematic error by convolving each spectral type by the range of velocity dispersions given above and using other templates of similar but not identical temperature to measure @xmath39 ( e.g.  a k0iii template to measure an artificially broadened k3iii template ) .",
    "this analysis showed that template mismatch produced at most an rms uncertainty of 1 km s@xmath0  when @xmath39 was calculated for a single order .",
    "given the large number of orders available and our estimate of the range in @xmath39 of these clusters , we then experimented with combining multiple orders together as well as binning the data to improve snr .",
    "a range of tests showed we obtain excellent and very stable results over the wavelength range 5000  6800   and the spectra rebinned to a scale of 0.2   pixel@xmath0 .",
    "the rms variation due to template mismatch over this range was less than 0.5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "ccfs for all 14 clusters are shown in figure  [ fig : ccf ] and the measured @xmath39 and estimated uncertainties are listed in table  [ tbl : obs ] .",
    "the 5000  6800   spectral range does not include the higher snr cat region . while the cat lines are quite strong for all of the clusters ( see figure  [ fig : cat ] ) , these lines are in fact so strong that they exhibit significant damping wings .",
    "these damping wings broaden the line profiles of the template stars significantly and they are not a good representation of the instrumental line profile .",
    "the cat lines in the template stars have intrinsic widths comparable to or larger than the measured velocity dispersions of the globular clusters over the 5000  6800    region .",
    "we therefore did not use these lines to measure the cluster velocity dispersions .",
    "the neighboring , red orders have comparable snr to the cat region , although these orders are contaminated by significant telluric absorption .",
    "although the telluric absorption is to some extent correctable , these orders were also discarded for the velocity dispersion measurement because the snr in the 5000  6800   region is sufficiently high that snr is at most a modest contributor to the total error budget ( see below ) .",
    "while there are still reasonably strong lines in the 5000  6800   region , notably mg@xmath41 and h@xmath42 , these lines only make a minor contribution to the velocity dispersion measurement .",
    "given the range of snr and @xmath39 of these data , we performed simulations with our template stars to determine the quality of our measurements as a function of both snr and @xmath39 .",
    "these tests were performed by first convolving the best - fitting template ( hd  88284 ) with the range of velocity dispersions described above .",
    "we then added noise to these convolved spectra to produce a set of output spectra with average snr of [ 2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ] for each velocity dispersion .",
    "as the snr per pixel is quite variable due to both the blaze function and the red color of these clusters , we used an input snr spectrum from one of the cluster observations ( c23 , shown in figure  [ fig : c23 ] ) to reproduce the pixel - to - pixel variation in the snr , while forcing the mean snr in the spectra to equal the specified values .",
    "the widths of these input spectra were then calculated in a similar fashion to the globular cluster measurements described above .",
    "the results of this analysis for @xmath43 km s@xmath0(the range most appropriate to this study ) are shown in figure  [ fig : snr ] .",
    "this figure displays the difference between the input @xmath39 and the measured @xmath39 at a given snr , normalized by the input @xmath39 .    as expected , the deviation between the input @xmath39 and the measured @xmath39 increases toward lower snr .",
    "in particular , these simulations show that at lower snr the measurements will tend to overestimate @xmath39 .",
    "this may be because the addition of noise systematically erases narrower features more readily than broader features .",
    "the simulations also show that at a given snr the velocity dispersion measurement will be more accurate if the intrinsic velocity dispersion is lower .",
    "this is likely a reflection of the net snr over the number of pixels that comprise a given feature .",
    "the fewer pixels that span , e.g.  the absorption lines employed here , the higher the net snr of the feature relative to a spectrum of the same mean snr per pixel with a larger @xmath39 .",
    "this systematic effect on the @xmath39 measurement impacts our observations at most at the 5% level .",
    "three of the clusters with velocity dispersions of on order 10 km s@xmath0(c25 , c41 , c44 ) have a mean snr less than 10 over then 5000  6800   range in our rebinned spectra , while three ( c2 , c31 , c32 ) in the 14 km s@xmath0range have a mean snr @xmath44 ( see table  [ tbl : obs ] ) .",
    "the measured velocity dispersions for these low - snr clusters have been adjusted to account for the expected overestimate .",
    "the remaining clusters do not suffer from systematic errors due to low snr .",
    "the resolution of our rebinned spectra could also impact the measured @xmath39 as the velocity dispersion resolution now varies from 12 km s@xmath0at 5000   to 8.8 km s@xmath0at 6800  .",
    "however , measurements of @xmath39 with a dispersion of 0.1   pixel@xmath0 yield consistent results with the values in table  [ tbl : obs ] , although with somewhat larger scatter due to the lower snr .",
    "the relationship between measured @xmath39 and snr at each @xmath39 shown in figure  [ fig : snr ] also demonstrates that the measured @xmath39 converges to the input value as the snr increases .",
    "the measured values quoted in table  [ tbl : obs ] also agree well with measurements obtained from single , unbinned orders and direct - pixel fitting , although the latter approaches have larger scatter .",
    "we note that preliminary velocity dispersions measurements from high - resolution spectroscopy of four ngc  5128  globular clusters were obtained by dubath and reported in @xcite .",
    "these measurements are marginally consistent with our own .",
    "the @xmath45 spectral extraction window we employed corresponds to a physical area of @xmath46 pc , which is larger than the half - light radius for all of these clusters ( e.g.  see table  [ tbl : params ] ) . in king models for globular clusters ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is a function of radius .",
    "our measurements , because they include most of the cluster , should correspond well to the global , one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , the core one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath48 is approximately the quantity measured for galactic globular clusters and the most commonly quoted quantity in the literature . the core value @xmath48 is larger than @xmath47 in the king models and the degree of difference depends on cluster concentration . for the clusters studied here ,",
    "this correction is on order 5 ",
    "10% for the range of cluster concentrations in this sample ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the errorbars quoted in table  [ tbl : obs ] include the uncertainties in this correction , which are caused by uncertainties in the measured structural parameters reported by @xcite and the exact placement of the slit , as well as the uncertainties due to template mismatch and snr .",
    "these 14 globular clusters are the brightest clusters with king model structural parameters measured with _ hst _  by @xcite .",
    "these models are described by the parameters @xmath49 ( central potential ) , @xmath50 ( core radius ) and @xmath51 ( cluster concentration , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the tidal radius ) . @xcite",
    "also fit for ellipticity .",
    "both @xmath50 and @xmath54 ( the model half - mass radius ) from their fits are provided in table  [ tbl : params ] , converted to parsecs , and their measurement of @xmath51 is also given .",
    "the projected half - light radius is @xmath55 .",
    "as these values span the approximate range of @xmath56 , none are core - collapse clusters .",
    "all 14 of these clusters were also included in the recent study by @xcite , who have obtained @xmath57 photometry and radial velocities for over 200 ngc  5128  globular clusters .",
    "as most of the @xcite photometry is from unfiltered stis images , we have listed instead the @xcite @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 values in the table , where these quantities have been dereddened based on their quoted @xmath61 and assuming @xmath62 .",
    "we also include the central surface brightness @xmath63 from @xcite , but recalibrated by the difference between their quoted @xmath28 magnitudes and those in @xcite , and have calculated the mean , reddening - corrected surface brightness within the projected half - light radius : @xmath64 .",
    "all of these dereddened values only account for galactic dust and do not include any dust intrinsic to ngc  5128 .",

    "globular clusters are clearly separated from galaxies .",

    "there is also a separation in the @xmath123 coordinate ( @xmath119 ) between globular clusters and galaxies , although not as stark as @xmath121 ( see figure  [ fig : kappa ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the mean mass - to - light ratio of galactic globulars is 1.45 @xcite , and @xcite found a comparable number for m33 . while the higher mass - to - light ratio for ngc  5128  clusters is somewhat surprising , this may be a common feature of more massive clusters .",
    "for example , the mass - to - light ratios of @xmath6cen and g1 are in the same range as those in ngc  5128 , as are the mass - to - light ratios ( or @xmath123 values ) of other massive clusters in the galaxy and m31 .",
    "the @xmath123 values for dwarf and regular elliptical galaxies are higher than for most globular clusters , reflecting their larger mass - to - light ratios , although they overlap with the most massive globular clusters .",
    "the fundamental plane relationship for spheroidal galaxies requires @xmath133 @xcite . a relationship between mass ( or luminosity ) and mass - to - light ratio for the most massive globular clusters",
    "is suggested by their apparently higher @xmath123 values .",
    "the @xmath122 ( @xmath134 ) coordinate is essentially an indicator of surface brightness at the effective radius as its dependence on @xmath119 is much weaker than @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath122 exhibits a great deal of overlap in the properties of all spheroidal systems .",
    "in fact , the galaxies overlap much more closely with galactic globular clusters than those in ngc  5128 .",
    "this is because @xmath122 is dominated by the mean surface brightness within the effective radius and the ngc  5128  clusters are on average lower in mean surface brightness within this radius ( e.g.  see figure  [ fig : fp ] ) .",
    "while the ngc  5128  globular clusters overlap more with other globular clusters than galaxies , they are an even better match to the nuclei of the dwarf ellipticals studied by @xcite , who measured both integrated and nuclear velocity dispersions and surface brightnesses for a sample of virgo dwarf ellipticals . while the integrated properties of nucleated dwarf galaxies ( _ large , open squares _ ) fall within the region of @xmath120space inhabited by other dwarf ellipticals and spheroids ( _ diamonds _ ) , their nuclei ( _ squares with crosses _ ) overlap very well with the ngc  5128  clusters .",
    "the @xmath135 relation for giant elliptical galaxies and bulges exhibits an anticorrelation between mass and surface brightness that sets them nearly orthogonal to the dwarf galaxies , which are correlated in @xmath136 .",
    "this correlation reflects the correlation between luminosity and larger cores of higher surface brightness found by @xcite .",
    "while this correlation suggests mass loss due to winds , @xcite found that mass loss would produce too steep a relation between @xmath121 and @xmath122 , instead suggesting the observed dwarfs are the remnants of a larger , unobserved population .",
    "the massive globular clusters appear to exhibit a similar @xmath135 correlation , although steeper than the dwarf galaxies .",
    "the strong dynamical and photometric similarities of these massive globular clusters to the nuclei of dwarf galaxies has interesting implications for models which posit stripped dwarf galaxy nuclei as the origin of the most massive globular clusters .",
    "the most massive local group clusters , such as @xmath6cen in our own galaxy and g1 in m31 , have both been discussed and modeled as stripped dwarf nuclei @xcite .",
    "the position of @xmath6cen and g1 in figures  [ fig : fp ] and [ fig : kappa ] show that the ngc  5128  clusters occupy a similar region of the fundamental plane and @xmath120space .",
    "all of these massive clusters have comparable masses , mass - to - light ratios , and central surface brightnesses .",
    "support of the interpretation of these clusters as tidally - stripped galaxy nuclei is provided by the tentative detection of extratidal light by @xcite for six of the globular clusters ( marked with an @xmath36 in table  [ tbl : params ] and [ tbl : mass ] , _ partly filled circles _ in the figures ) . in the context of the stripped - dwarf model ,",
    "it is tempting to view this extratidal light as the last vestiges of the extended dwarf envelope around these nuclei , although extratidal light may also be present due to the evaporation of cluster stars by two - body relaxation .",
    "deeper observations of these and other massive clusters would be extremely valuable to confirm and quantify this extratidal light .",
    "such observations would also better quantify the ellipticities of these globular clusters , which are comparable to those of @xmath6cen and g1 but greater than those of dwarf nuclei .",
    "these globular clusters may also simply represent the upper end of the globular cluster mass function in ngc  5128 .",
    "the similarities between these globular clusters and the most massive globular clusters in the local group are more established than the interpretation of the better - studied local group clusters as tidally - stripped dwarf nuclei .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for yet more massive young star clusters that demonstrate that there is overlap between the masses of the most massive star clusters and the least massive dwarf galaxies .",
    "the most massive star cluster known is w3 , a cluster with @xmath137 km s@xmath0   in the merger remnant ngc  7252 @xcite .",
    "the inferred mass of this cluster is nearly @xmath138 m@xmath72 , even more massive than the nuclei of the dwarf galaxies studied by @xcite . even if we were to make the extreme suggestion that all of the ngc  5128  globular clusters are in fact relic dwarf nuclei , the existence of w3 demonstrates there is overlap between the masses of galaxies and star clusters .    on the other side of the mass gap , the ultra - compact dwarf galaxies in the fornax cluster @xcite are actually _ less _ massive than w3 and overlap with the most massive ngc  5128  clusters .",
    "these dwarfs have velocity dispersions of @xmath139 km s@xmath0 , effective radii of 10  30 pc , masses in the range @xmath140 m@xmath72 , and mass - to - light ratios of 2  4 in solar units @xcite .",
    "they are thus very comparable to the larger and more massive of the ngc  5128  globular clusters .",
    "numerical models for these ultra - compact dwarfs have shown that they can form from nucleated dwarfs that have been stripped of their envelopes by tidal forces in a cluster @xcite .",
    "this stripping process can explain the ultra - compact dwarfs in fornax , although it will operate over approximately a factor of 2 smaller radius in a smaller group like ngc  5128  due to decreased tidal shear .",
    "the radius for the tidal stripping of ngc  5128  globular cluster progenitors is likely to be on order 10  kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure  7 ) , comparable to the projected distances of 5  23  kpc for some of the ngc  5128  globular clusters in this study .",
    "it is therefore plausible that tidal stripping could have transformed at least some nucleated dwarf galaxies into these ngc  5128  globular clusters .",
    "another aspect of the tidally - stripped dwarf model is that their dark matter halos can not be too cuspy as otherwise the relatively concentrated dark matter core will be too effective at retaining the stellar envelope . in their study",
    ", @xcite used the dark matter profile of @xcite ( originally proposed by @xcite for dwarf galaxies ) , rather than the more commonly adopted profile of @xcite , because it has a flatter core .",
    "however , this requirement for a relatively flat dark matter core may remove one possible explanation for the higher mass - to - light ratio of these massive globular clusters .",
    "while a residual dark matter halo from their dwarf galaxy past is a possible explanation for the larger mass - to - light ratios of these ngc  5128  clusters , a dark matter profile with a flat , low - density core will also be more efficiently stripped away @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the high mass - to - light ratios of these massive globular clusters is if they formed in a starburst with a truncated stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "a mass function with relatively more low - mass stars would produce a higher mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the detailed shapes and kinematics of the nuclei of nucleated dwarfs and the most massive globular clusters may provide one way to further investigate the potential connection between these two populations .",
    "the most massive globular clusters have significant ellipticities @xcite , while this does not appear to be the case for the nuclei of nucleated dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , the same tidal forces that strip a dwarf envelope may also induce significant ellipticities .",
    "the importance of rotational flattening and anisotropies in the velocity distribution may also serve to distinguish between dwarf nuclei and globular clusters .",
    "the hypothesis that some of the most massive globular clusters are the nuclei of galaxies offers an appealing explanation for recent evidence of an intermediate - mass black hole in g1 @xcite .",
    "the mass of this black hole falls on the same @xmath141 relationship for galaxies and suggests that the formation mechanisms for black holes in star clusters and galaxy spheroids are similar .",
    "if g1 is instead simply a tidally - stripped , nucleated dwarf galaxy , the problem is reduced in complexity and only one physical mechanism for black hole growth is required to explain the @xmath141 relation .",
    "an alternate interpretation of the similarity between the most massive globular clusters and the nuclei of nucleated dwarfs is that the later are simply star clusters that have migrated to or formed at the centers of these dwarfs .",
    "the properties of these objects would then be probes of massive star clusters in different environments , rather than of actual overlap between the properties of the most massive star clusters and the least massive galaxies .",
    "this interpretation also explains their similar location in @xmath120space , although stands in contrast to the simple explanation for the intermediate - mass black hole in g1 .",
    "we have measured velocity dispersions for a sample of 14 globular clusters in the nearby , luminous elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 , the first such study of the globular cluster system of a luminous elliptical galaxy and the first such study outside the local group .",
    "these clusters have velocity dispersions in the range 10  30 km s@xmath0 , comparable to the largest previously measured values for globular clusters . we have used measured king model structural parameters for these clusters from the literature to derive masses for all 14 clusters .",
    "these clusters are comparable in mass to the most massive galactic globular cluster @xmath6cen and m31 s g1 . from these data we find the following :    \\1 .",
    "the globular clusters in ngc  5128  approximately follow the same fundamental plane relationships as local group globular clusters and extend them to approximately an order of magnitude higher mass and luminosity .",
    "these clusters begin to bridge the mass gap between the most massive globular clusters and the least massive dwarf galaxies . in particular",
    ", there is very good overlap in the photometric , structural , and kinematic properties of these clusters and the properties of both nucleated dwarf elliptical nuclei and ultra - compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "the large masses of these clusters , combined with the possible detection of extratidal light for some objects by @xcite , suggest that some of these globular clusters are in fact the nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies .",
    "the common properties of the most massive star clusters and the nuclei of the least massive dwarfs suggest that both the formation mechanisms for star cluster and galaxies can produce objects in the same region of the fundamental plane or @xmath120space . alternately , the nuclei of nucleated dwarf galaxies may simply be star clusters that happen to lie in the centers of galaxies , rather than true galaxy nuclei .",
    "future spectroscopic observations of additional massive globular clusters could quantify the relative contribution of relic dwarf nuclei to this population through kinematics and with stellar population models , while deep , high - resolution images could provide better measurements of structural parameters , particularly in the core , and search for and study diffuse , low surface - brightness envelopes .",
