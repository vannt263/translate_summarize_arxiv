    "many schemes of creating entanglement between spatially separated nodes have been proposed @xcite and some experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these schemes are either probabilistic or have yet to be demonstrated experimentally .    recently",

    "it is found that semiconductor qds can be strongly coupled to photonic crystal cavity systems @xcite .",
    "however , due to the dot size variation , semiconductor qds usually have different radiative properties , which make it difficult to generate entanglement by indistinguishable emitting photons , as those have been done in atomic systems .",
    "there are two approaches to overcome the problem : ( i ) tuning the qds into resonance by using externally applied strain @xcite , or controlling the overhauser field @xcite or ( ii ) making a detuning between quantum dots and the same frequency output cavity modes @xcite , or using quantum frequency conversion @xcite .",
