    "physical processes occurring in a wide class of phenomena are strongly affected by large fluctuations and rare events .",
    "these are often crucial to determine the behavior of a system and their contribution and their statistics strongly influence the observed physical properties .",
    "large fluctuation effects have been observed in laser cooling  @xcite , in liposome diffusion  @xcite , in heteropolymers dynamics  @xcite , in systems with chaos  @xcite and in non - equilibrium relaxation  @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the typical heterogeneity of spatial structures or temporal patterns can lead to _ anomalous _ transport : the mean square displacement ( msd ) of a particle is not linear in time , so that @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , and one observes subdiffusion , @xmath2 , or superdiffusion , @xmath3 .",
    "however , if the fluctuations in the microscopic dynamics are sufficiently small , standard diffusion can survive also in the presence of heterogeneity .    in these subtle situations ,",
    "one can still be able to detect the heterogeneous nature of the underlying microscopic dynamic by means of an applied field . indeed , recently , we have analyzed a broad class of continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) with large fluctuations effects in space and time distributions : a random walk with trapping , typical of subdiffusion in disordered and glassy materials , and a lvy walk process , often used to model superdiffusion in inhomogeneous media @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in presence of an external field an anomalous growth of fluctuations can be observed even when the unperturbed behavior is gaussian @xcite and the einstein relation @xcite holds .",
    "recent results of numerical simulations of complex liquids  @xcite , have shown that superdiffusion can be induced by an external field in trap - like disordered systems . however , as explained in  @xcite , such a behavior is more general , and can be observed in driven crowded systems , far from the glass transition , due to confinement effects .    in our previous work , we have solved the master equations of the two processes and we have determined the probability distribution @xmath4 for the particle to be at point @xmath5 at time @xmath6 in the presence of an external field @xmath7 .",
    "our results shows that when transport is anomalous , the drift has a strong influence on distributions , as expected .",
    "more surprisingly , in the regimes where the form of the unperturbed distribution is gaussian , the field can induce a non - gaussian shape of @xmath4 . in particular , in the ctrw with trapping , in a region of the parameters of the highly fluctuating waiting times distribution",
    ", the drift induces a superdiffusive spreading of the perturbed non - gaussian @xmath4 . even in this subtle case ,",
    "the measure of the response to a field is therefore able to detect the anomalous dynamics present in the waiting times and step lengths distribution .",
    "moreover , a small field can induce a transition from standard gaussian diffusion to a _",
    "strong _ anomalous one , i.e the scaling of moments of different order is not described by a unique exponent : @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient to obtain our previous results relies on the scaling properties of the probability distribution @xmath4 , and on the subtle effects of the different length scales present in the process in the presence of a field .",
    "recently , different heuristic yet powerful techniques have been developed and applied to estimate the scaling form of probability distribution functions : a matching condition arising from cut off effects  @xcite , and the `` single long jump hypothesis '' , that is able to extracts the largest contribution of rare events to the tails of the probability distribution  @xcite . in this paper , we apply these two interesting techniques to reproduce the scaling regimes observed in the two ctrw in their normal , anomalous and strong anomalous regimes .",
    "our models contain a scale invariant distribution of trapping times and a scale invariant distributions of displacements .",
    "we consider a ctrw where a brownian particle is trapped for a time interval distributed according to the distribution  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the exponent characterizing the slow decay  @xcite .",
    "then , we consider the case of fat tails in displacements distribution , that typically arises in lvy - like motion in heterogeneous materials  @xcite , or in turbulent flow  @xcite and granular materials  @xcite . here",
    ", transport is realized through increments of size @xmath12 with distribution @xmath13  @xcite that can give rise to superdiffusive dynamics .",
    "let us now discuss in details the two models and the scaling forms of the probability distributions .",
    "the ctrw with trapping describes a particle moving with probability @xmath14 from @xmath5 to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 constant , or extracted from a symmetric distribution with finite variance . between successive steps ,",
    "the particle is trapped for a time @xmath17 extracted from the distribution  ( [ levy ] ) . in the lvy walk model , during the time interval @xmath17 , always extracted from the same distribution  ( [ levy ] ) , the particle moves at constant velocity @xmath18 .",
    "the velocity is here chosen from a symmetric distribution with finite variance @xmath19 , so that the particle performs displacements @xmath20 .",
    "we consider a gaussian distribution @xmath19 for the velocity . in both models ,",
    "we introduce a lower cutoff @xmath21 in the distribution  ( [ levy ] ) so that , taking into account the normalization , we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the heaviside step function . the value of @xmath24 does not change the behavior of the models apart from a suitable rescaling of the constants .    in the ctrw with trapping , the external field unbalances the jump probabilities , i.e. setting to @xmath25 the probability of jumping to the right or to the left , respectively . for the lvy walk ,",
    "the system is driven out of equilibrium by applying an external field accelerating the particle during the walk , so that the distance travelled in the time interval @xmath17 is @xmath26 . in the following",
    ", we will consider a positive bias @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "the presence of these additional length scales strongly modifies the behavior of the mean square displacement and of all the higher moments .",
    "hereafter , we will call @xmath39 the position of the peak of the distribution and @xmath40 the distance from this peak .",
    "let us now see how the scaling form of the distribution and the asymptotic behavior of its moments can be obtained by two powerful techniques : a matching condition in presence of cut offs and the `` single long jump hypothesis '' .",
