    "we shall consider the following class of feynman integrals @xmath1 where the propagator denominators @xmath2 are defined by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the space - time dimension , and the external momenta @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are lightlike .",
    "the integrals  ( [ eq : idef ] ) then depend on two scales : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we shall mainly be concerned with cases where @xmath18 is either zero or a negative integer .",
    "these integrals correspond to the diagram shown in figure  [ fig : pbox ] , and are important for calculations of two - loop scattering amplitudes of massless particles , for example in qcd @xcite .    the scalar double box integral @xmath19 was calculated analytically by smirnov @xcite as a laurent expansion in @xmath0 to @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , smirnov and veretin constructed a general algorithm @xcite to deal with tensor double box integrals . in this algorithm ,",
    "integrals with arbitrary polynomials of loop momenta in the numerator are first expressed in terms of scalar integrals @xmath21 with increased integer powers of the propagators in shifted space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "then , using integration by parts identities @xcite , these scalar integrals are systematically reduced to linear combinations of a set of master integrals , consisting of @xmath22 , a second master double box integral , @xmath23 and a small number of more simple master integrals ( see figure  [ fig : pinchings ] ) .",
    "furthermore , they gave an explicit analytical expression for the second master integral @xmath24 , again as a laurent expansion in @xmath0 to @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath25    it appeared that the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite completely solved the problem of calculating on - shell double box diagrams .",
    "however , as was reported by glover at this workshop @xcite , it often happens that in the reduction of a given tensor integral , the coefficients in front of the master integrals @xmath22 and @xmath24 are of order @xmath26 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in the reduction of these integrals it is necessary to reduce the dimension down to @xmath11 from at least @xmath27 , and in the system of equations for the dimensional shift , there are factors of @xmath28 sitting in front of @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , in order to calculate such tensor integrals to @xmath29 , one would need to know @xmath22 and @xmath24 to one order higher in @xmath0 than they are given in refs .",

    "a typical example is the following integral with an irreducible numerator : @xmath30 whose reduction to master integrals reads @xcite : @xmath31{i_{diag}^d}(s , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 24\\frac{(d-3)}{(d-6)t}{i_{bbox}^d}(s , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -4\\frac{(d-3)^2(2d-9)}{(d-4)^2(d-5)s^2}{i_{spec}^d}(s ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{(d-3)(3d-10)}{(d-4)^2(d-5)^2(d-6)s^2 t } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\left[8(d-4)(d-5)^2s \\right .",

    "( [ eq : relmasters ] ) are the ones we are concerned about .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the integral with the irreducible numerator @xmath34 directly from a mellin - barnes representation .",
    "it can then be used instead of @xmath24 as a new master integral .",
    "we check our result in two different ways : firstly , by verifying that @xmath22 and @xmath34 satisfy a system of differential equations , and secondly , by using them to compute @xmath22 and @xmath24 in @xmath35 dimensions , both of which are finite , and comparing the result with a numerical integration .",
    "the analytic structure of the on - shell double box is rather simple , since it only depends on two scales , and its only thresholds are at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the main difficulty in calculating this diagram is to find a way to isolate its infrared and collinear divergences .",
    "a general recursive solution to this problem based on feynman parameters was proposed in ref .",
    "however , for the analytical calculation we are going to present here , it is more convenient to use a mellin - barnes representation  @xcite , which enables us to isolate the poles in @xmath0 in a very natural way .",
    "we derive our mellin - barnes representation for the two - loop integrals ( [ eq : idef ] ) by doing the loop integrations one by one ( cf .",
    "the off - shell calculation  @xcite ) . in terms of feynman parameters",
    ", the @xmath38-loop can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( similar abbreviations will be used below ) , and @xmath41 by introducing three mellin - barnes parameters , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we split the polynomial @xmath45 into factors : @xmath46 after inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - mb ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : l - loopfp ] ) , we evaluate the feynman parameter integrals in terms of gamma functions , which gives us the following mellin - barnes representation for the @xmath38-loop : @xmath47 when this result is inserted into ( [ eq : idef ] ) , the remaining @xmath48-integral has the form of an on - shell massless one - loop box diagram with indices @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "we repeat the above steps for this @xmath48-integral , using a further mellin - barnes parameter , @xmath53 , and finally obtain @xmath54 in deriving this formula , we have assumed that the various parameters are such , that all the manipulations we performed are justified .",
    "this is certainly true if we are able to find a set of straight lines , parallel to the imaginary axis , for the integration variables @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath53 , and @xmath44 , such that the arguments of all the gamma functions in it have positive real parts .",
    "we then define the integrals  ( [ eq : idef ] ) for values of the parameters where such contours do not exist by analytic continuation .",
    "let us now consider the case with the irreducible numerator , @xmath34 . on the one hand , from the definition  ( [ eq : i3def ] ) , @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the real parts of the arguments of all gamma functions are positive , then in particular @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive , and therefore @xmath59 .",
    "since this does not depend on @xmath60 , it means that in order to calculate @xmath34 using the mellin - barnes representation  ( [ eq : mb - general ] ) , we must perform an analytic continuation not only in @xmath60 , but also in @xmath61 or @xmath18 .",
    "we choose @xmath18 . setting @xmath62 and all other @xmath63 s equal to one ,",
    "we get @xmath64 we can make the real parts of the arguments of all gamma functions in eq .",

    "starting from these values , we first perform an analytic continuation in @xmath71 to @xmath72 , keeping @xmath0 fixed , and then another one in @xmath0 to the vicinity of @xmath73 .",
    "the procedure for both continuations is straightforward : keeping the integration contours fixed , we simply have to keep track of the poles of the gamma functions , and whenever one of them crosses an integration contour , add its residue to a list of terms that will contribute to the final answer . for example , with the above choice of contours , the first crossing happens at @xmath74 , when the pole at @xmath75 crosses the @xmath44-contour . after taking a residue in one integration variable",
    ", we continue to follow the poles in the remaining variables , building up a tree of single and multiple residue terms . by this procedure",
    ", poles in @xmath0 are automatically expressed through singular gamma functions multiplying integrals that can safely be expanded under the integral sign .    to @xmath20",
    ", it turns out that , along with terms where there is no integral left , only single and two - fold integrals contribute , because terms with more integrals are killed by the factor @xmath76 in eq .",
