    "we consider a model consisting of two barriers with varying strength and with a uniform varying potential in between them .",
    "such a structure can serve as a simple model of an actual structure used in experiments @xcite@xmath0@xcite and can serve as a prototype of a quantum pump with immovable in space potentials . our approach is based on the floquet scattering matrix formalism which we developed in ref .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[db ] we represent the floquet scattering matrix of a fast driven double - barrier system as a sum of the contributions arising from different reflection / transmission processes accompanying an electron propagation through the system , fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "our approach takes into account effects due to finiteness of the time spent by electrons inside the system . in sec.[dc ] we find the dc generated current at arbitrary driving frequency and arbitrary temperature .",

    "here we have introduced the level spacing @xmath68 ( near the fermi energy ) for a double - barrier structure detached from the leads . at low temperatures , @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 , while at high temperatures , @xmath71 , the factor @xmath63 is exponentially small ,    @xmath72     + and describes the exponential suppression of the interference terms at large temperatures .",
    "note the effect of the temperature we consider is only due to energy averaging .",
    "we do not consider dephasing but assume that electrons preserve phase coherence as they propagate through the sample .",
    "the crossover temperature @xmath73 is familiar from the persistent current problem ( see , e.g. , ref . ) and it appears as a characteristic temperature @xcite for interference phenomena in single channel ballistic structures .    the two parts , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , of the pumped current result from different processes that lead to different temperature dependencies .",
    "@xcite the first part , @xmath54 , is a sum of contribution , @xmath74 , arising from different electron s paths inside the system .",
    "the paths differ by incoming ( @xmath14 ) and outgoing ( @xmath15 ) leads , and by the index @xmath57 counting the number of reflections inside the system . according to ref .",
    "the quantum pump effect ( i.e. , the effect which results in a dc current generated by the periodically driven mesoscopic system ) is due to interference of various photon - assisted amplitudes describing the interaction of propagating electrons with a scatterer that varies periodically in time .",

    "each such path can be characterized by a delay time @xmath75 , i.e. , the difference of times when an electron enters and leaves the system .",

    "consequently the energy integration becomes trivial .",
    "in contrast , the second part , @xmath55 , due to interference between different paths ( i.e. , due to inter - channel interference ) is defined as a sum of terms oscillating in energy .",
    "consequently it vanishes at high temperatures .",
    "equation ( [ eqdc_4 ] ) gives the dc current generated by the double - barrier structure at arbitrary temperature and at arbitrary driving frequency . at slow driving , @xmath78 , it agrees with the famous brouwer s result @xcite for an adiabatic pumped current . at larger driving frequencies",
    ", it reproduces the numerical results of ref .",
    "obtained for a double - barrier structure in the zero temperature limit .    from eq.([eqdc_4 ] ) it follows that with increasing temperature or driving frequency the different dynamical scattering channels contribute independently to the dc current , @xmath79 . with regard to the frequency",
    "this follows from the observation that the ratio @xmath80 behaves as @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath82 the contribution @xmath54 dominates .",
    "so we can conclude : ( i ) at high temperatures , @xmath83 the dc current ( both adiabatic and non - adiabatic ) is independent of the fermi energy ( over a scale much smaller than the fermi energy itself ) .",

    "using eq.([eqb_7 ] ) and performing integration over energy in the same way as we did to get eq.([eqdc_4 ] ) , we obtain :    [ eqb_10 ] @xmath186    @xmath187    the pumped current @xmath41 , eq.([eqdc_1 ] ) , is conserved : @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , the conservation of the whole current @xmath189 , eq.([eqb_8 ] ) , implies @xmath190 .",
    "the latter in turn leads to the following constraint : @xmath191 .",
    "quite similar to the case with @xmath158 we find that this constant is the unity .",
    "using this condition one can split @xmath178 into the rectification [ i.e. , vanishing at @xmath192 and interference parts as follows :    [ eqb_10_1 ] @xmath193\\frac{\\tilde g_{12}(t ) + \\tilde g_{21}(t)}{2}\\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath194\\,.\\ ] ]     + the interference contribution can be non - zero , @xmath195 , if and only if the dynamical scatterer shows different time - dependent transmissions to the left and to the right , @xmath196 , see fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "in addition , the time - dependent voltages should be present , @xmath197 .",
    "the last statement follows from the fact that after averaging over time the matrix @xmath198 becomes symmetric in lead indices .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the current @xmath199 is due to an interplay of the external induced dynamics and the internally induced dynamics .    the excess current @xmath178 , arising in the presence of external ac voltages , comprises two contributions : a pure rectification current , @xmath184 , and an additional pumped current , @xmath185 .",
    "these two contributions differ from each other .",
    "in addition they differ from the current pumped by the unbiased dynamical scatterer . formally , the last mentioned difference is due to the fact that @xmath178 is defined by the scattering matrix @xmath180 while @xmath41 is defined by the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "this results in a different frequency dependence , see fig.[fig5 ] for @xmath178 and fig.[fig2 ] ( black solid line ) for the pumped current .",
    "everything mentioned makes it difficult to extract a pure pumped current from an experimentally measured dc current .",
    "if the voltages at contacts are time - independent , @xmath200 , equation ( [ eqb_10a ] ) transforms into eq.([eqb_2 ] ) since the average over a pump period for quantities @xmath201 and @xmath158 is the same .",
    "this follows directly from eq.([eqb_7 ] ) ( the second line ) .",
    "note by analogy with @xmath147 we interpret @xmath202 as equal - departure - time probabilities for transmission / reflection of electrons with fermi energy : this quantity is the probability for an electron entering the system at a given [ defined by the potential @xmath203 in eq.([eqb_10a ] ) ] time moment @xmath19 through the lead @xmath14 to leave the system through the lead @xmath15 . accordingly to eq.([eqb_10b ] ) the events with electrons leaving the system at different time moments do contribute to @xmath202 .",
    "we note the equation ( [ eqb_10 ] ) was obtained for high temperatures .",
    "for lower temperature we have no instant - time quantity like @xmath202 with a transparent physical meaning .",
    "the matrix @xmath180 entering eq.([eqb_9 ] ) obeys a constraint that is non - local in time , eq.([eqb_6 ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed current and noise generated by a dynamical double - barrier structure with and without an external bias at arbitrary temperature and at arbitrary frequency and amplitude of a periodic harmonic drive .    to perform such an analysis",
    "we have developed a method to calculate analytically the scattering matrices @xmath1 and @xmath171 whose fourier coefficients define the elements of the floquet scattering matrix , eqs.([eq_new1 ] ) and ( [ eqb_5 ] ) .",
    "for the elements of these matrices which we found for the double - barrier structure there exists a simple interpretation .",
    "this interpretation allows to find the corresponding matrices for more involved systems .",
    "for instance , the matrix element @xmath204 , eq.([eqdb_13a ] ) , can be calculated as a sum over all the possible paths which an electron can follow to propagating through the system . here",
    "the partial amplitude @xmath205 corresponds to a particle entering the system with energy @xmath2 through the lead @xmath14 and leaving the system through the lead @xmath15 at a time moment @xmath19 .",
    "the summation index @xmath57 corresponds to the path @xmath13 having definite length ( in our case for @xmath206 this length is a product of the number @xmath17 of reflections inside the system and the distance @xmath9 between the two barriers ) .",
    "each partial amplitude is a product of amplitudes corresponding to an instantaneous interaction with time - dependent point - like barriers ( in our case these amplitudes are the elements of matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) and a number of amplitudes @xmath207}$ ] corresponding to free propagation ( having a duration of @xmath23 ) between the barriers .",
    "the time moments , at which the corresponding amplitudes are calculated , are counted backwards along the path in a descending order starting from the time moment @xmath19 when the particle leaves the system .",
    "we found an analogous interpretation for elements of the matrix @xmath171 .",
    "the in- and out- scattering matrices become equal ( and equal to the frozen scattering matrix ) in the limit of a slow drive , @xmath39 . at any finite driving frequencies ( @xmath208 ) they are different .",
    "nevertheless there is a simple relation between these matrices . to find it we use the micro reversibility of the equations of motion .",
    "let the driving parameters depend on time in the following way : @xmath209 , see , eq.([eqdb_1 ] ) .",
    "then the elements of the floquet scattering matrix are subject to the following symmetry : @xcite    @xmath210     + here @xmath211 is the set of all the @xmath212 s .",
    "in addition we introduced a possibly present magnetic field @xmath213 . substituting eqs.([eqdb_9 ] ) and ( [ eqb_5 ] ) into eq.([eqc_1 ] ) and performing the inverse fourier transformation we arrive at the desired relation :    @xmath214     + note that each term of the decompositions , eq.([eqdb_13a ] ) and eq.([eqb_7 ] ) , satisfies eq.([eqc_2 ] ) separately .",
    "we showed that the scattering matrix @xmath30 defines currents generated by the oscillating scatterer itself , while the dual scattering matrix @xmath180 defines currents flowing through the scatterer under an external bias .",
    "here we calculated the matrix @xmath30 for arbitrary frequency and consequently we can calculate the current in the adiabatic as well as in the non - adiabatic regime .",
    "the adiabatic regime can be defined @xcite by considering the energy dependence of the stationary scattering matrix .",
    "since both transmission and reflection times are of the order of the dwell time , the latter is ( at least in the absence of interactions ) the relevant time scale .",
    "the results obtained here allows us to conclude that the dwell time is appropriate to define the adiabatic regime for zero - temperature pumping .",
    "in contrast , at high temperatures another time , the propagation time @xmath215 ( necessary for an electron to travel between the two barriers separated by the distance @xmath9 ) , defines a relevant time scale .",
    "let us consider the scattering processes which are relevant for pumping . generally speaking the interplay between the quantized energy exchange and the interference of photon - assisted scattering amplitudes is at the origin of the pump effect .",
    "@xcite as we showed , there are two types of interference processes .",
    "the first one takes place within the same spatial path ( intra - channel interference ) .",
    "a second process includes the interference between different spatial paths ( inter - channel interference ) .",
    "the former contributes to the generated current at low as well as at high temperatures , while the latter contributes only to the low temperature pump effect .",
    "the dwell time ( defined in the stationary case ) depends essentially on interference processes of the second type ( there it nothing to interfere within the same spatial path in the stationary case ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the dwell time is relevant only to low temperature pumping .",
    "in contrast for high temperatures we expect that a time of the order of the propagation time @xmath216 defines the lower bound for the period of a drive separating adiabatic and non - adiabatic dynamical regimes .",
    "our example suggest that distinction of inter- and intra - channel interference processes is also important for the magnetic field symmetry of the current pumped by a two - terminal scatterer .",
    "the intra - channel interference processes are not affected by the magnetic field .",
    "however the inter - channel processes are sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we can conjecture that with increasing frequency and/or temperature ( when only intra - channel interference processes matter ) the pumped current has to become symmetric in magnetic field like the stationary ( two - terminal ) conductance .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the low temperature adiabatic pump effect which has no definite symmetry under the magnetic field reversal , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "our conjecture agrees with experimental results presented in refs .   for large pumping frequencies and powers .",
    "the method presented in the present paper is also useful to calculate the time - dependent current generated by the dynamical scatterer .",
    "actually it was used in ref . to describe the nonlinear response of a coherent capacitor to a large amplitude drive . in a recent experiment",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that such a capacitor can serve as a very fast single electron source .    in conclusion",
    ", we developed a method to calculate analytically the floquet scattering matrix of a dynamical mesoscopic system consisting of a set of point - like scatterers and uniform potentials in between them .",
    "our approach allows to go beyond the adiabatic approximation and to analyze the properties of the generated current and its noise at arbitrary frequency and amplitude of the drive .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional structure consisting of two oscillating @xmath217-function barriers and an oscillating spatially uniform potential in between the barriers .",
    "all potentials oscillate with the same frequency .",
    "the single - particle scattering at a periodically driven system is described via the floquet scattering matrix @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite to find its elements one needs to solve the schrdinger equation for an electron wave function @xmath218 with , in our case , the following time - dependent potential :    @xmath219     + where @xmath220 is the heaviside step function .",
    "to calculate @xmath221 and @xmath222 we consider a plain wave of a unit amplitude with energy @xmath2 incident from the left .",
    "then the wave function @xmath218 outside the scatterer can be written as follows :    @xmath223     + here @xmath6 , @xmath224 , with @xmath225 being the electron mass .",
    "following ref .",
    "we represent the functions @xmath226 inside the scatterer in the form :    @xmath227     + where the coefficients @xmath228 , @xmath229 are independent of x and t. here @xmath230 is the fourier coefficient for a function @xmath231 describing the effect of an oscillating uniform potential @xmath85 ,    @xmath232\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ]     + where @xmath233 is the period of the drive .    to match the wave function coefficients at different spatial regions we use the boundary conditions formulated in terms of the scattering matrices @xmath234 and @xmath235 for point - like scatterers located at @xmath236 and @xmath237 , respectively .",
    "these conditions are :    @xmath238    we suppose that the frequency @xmath31 of the drive is small compared with the relevant electron energy @xmath2 ,    @xmath239     + we solve eq.([eqdb_5 ] ) to zeroth order in @xmath240 . within this accuracy",
    "we can simplify eq.([eqdb_5 ] ) .",
    "first , the floquet scattering matrix @xmath241 for a point - like scatterer ( i.e. , for a scatterer with a spatial extend much smaller than the de broglie wave length for an electron with energy e ) can be expressed in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath242 for a frozen scattering matrix @xmath243 ( i.e. , the stationary scattering matrix with a strength being dependent on time ) : @xcite    @xmath244     + for a single @xmath217-function barrier @xmath245 the frozen scattering matrix is well known .",
