    "to securing communications through the use of information theoretic notions was started by shannon in the 1940 s . in his papers he related fundamental notions , such as entropy , to the secrecy of cryptographic systems @xcite .",
    "inspired by the work of shannon , wyner published a paper proving that it was theoretically possible to secure communications solely through the choice of an encoding scheme for a specific channel model @xcite .",
    "wyner s security model capitalizes on the eavesdropper receiving a noisier copy of what the intended user receives .    in general , for communications security",
    ", assumptions on the capabilities of eavesdroppers are required to design systems . in wyner",
    "s paper , the presumption is on the channel noise of the eavesdropper .",
    "on the other hand , in contemporary cryptography it is assumed that the eavesdropper is subject to certain computational limitations .",
    "it is accepted that many people have attempted to break a cryptosystem , and their best efforts to recover plaintext require an infeasible amount of time . in particular ,",
    "the computational complexity of factoring products of primes is unknown , although it is widely accepted to be a hard problem .",
    "thus the only guarantee of the security of these systems is that numerous people have attempted to attack the system and have not succeeded .",
    "the question for physical layer security is what circumstances will allow similar conclusions about the eavesdropper s capabilities as in cryptography . in physical layer security , channel noise combined with a special encoder provide the security .",
    "thus for wyner s method , how can one ensure that the eavesdropper s channel has specific noise characteristics , thus limiting his / her decoding capabilities ?    the goal in this paper is to work with a well - studied channel model , and gradually relax restrictions on the eavesdropper s capabilities .",
    "as these relaxations are made , the effect on the security of the system will be evaluated .",
    "we will show that if the real channel characteristics deviate even slightly from the assumptions , all guarantees of security are lost .    since in a practical system , no assumptions ( either on the intended user s or the eavesdropper s channel ) are verifiable , we can not claim @xmath0 security .",
    "the intended users rarely have control over the eavesdropper s access ( especially in the wireless setting ) or the eavesdropper s behavior , so basing a security system on questionable assumptions is risky . on the other hand , wyner s basic idea",
    "can be easily combined with cryptographic methods to achieve a secure system based on computationally intractable problems .",
    "for example , we can artificially create a channel that is information - theoretically secure under the assumption that the shared key can not be recovered , i.e. , the recovery of the key is computationally intractable .",

    "ii , the channel model is presented .",

    "the question is how the additional uncertainty in the eavesdropper s channel leads to secrecy . to quantify the ability to send confidential messages over a broadcast channel ,",

    "this leaves the system open to man in the middle attacks .",
    "thus we must include measures to guarantee availability and authenticity of the public random vector .",
    "in addition , we must choose adequate coding parameters for the length of the @xmath165 vector , and the stochastic encoder , @xmath7 .",
    "a thorough analysis should be performed to find a characterization of the eavesdropper s channel with regards to wyner s wiretap model . in particular , assuming the randomness in @xmath166 is cryptographically secure , we say the main channel is a @xmath27 channel .",
    "then we may find a @xmath167 as large as possible and base the construction of @xmath7 on the assumption that the eavesdropper s channel is a @xmath28 .",
    "observe choosing @xmath168 large , increases the rate of our stochastic encoder , which reduces the security of our system .",
    "thus we must find an upper limit for @xmath168 such that the resulting parameters for @xmath165 and @xmath7 ensure it is computationally infeasible for the eavesdropper to recover the secret key .",
    "in this paper , one of the concerns in basing a security system on assumptions about the eavesdropping capabilities of an unintended user has been adressed .",
    "an alternative has been presented which uses one of the main principles of wyner s paper , security through stochastic encoding .",
    "it is a convenient solution , in the sense that it does not require any changes in infrastructure . in particular",
    ", it can be added on at the application layer .",
    "it is noted , that this is a toy example , and used to illustrate a point .",
    "a valid counter argument to the solution proposed in this paper , is that there is still an assumption made on the eavesdropper s capabilities in using this method .",
    "the onus has been transferred from relying on physically acquiring the signal to computational limitations . in regard to this argument , this paper than serves two purpose .",
    "first , it shows that care must be taken in assumptions about the eavesdropper .",
    "in addition , for a simple case it illustrates how to calculate the effect of incorrect assumptions , and engineer a system within certain secrecy tolerances .",
