    "up to now , the top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle with a mass close to the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking scale",
    ". thus it would be more sensitive to the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one way to study the new physics in the top quark sector is via the anomalous flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) couplings . within the sm ,",
    "the fcnc couplings are absent at tree level and occur through loop diagrams , which are further suppressed by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism  @xcite . however , in some new physics models , such as two higgs doublet model  @xcite , supersymmetric models  @xcite , extra dimensions models  @xcite , little higgs models  @xcite , and the @xmath1 model  @xcite , the fcnc processes can occur at tree level , which may enhance the cross section to observable level .    due to the small sm backgrounds for the same - sign dilepton final state ,",
    "the same - sign top pair production is a good channel to study the fcnc couplings .",
    "there are already a lot of articles  @xcite discussing the same - sign top pair production process , and in most of there , the process is induced by the fcnc couplings . in general , these fcnc couplings can be divided into several types .",
    "one of the most important types involves a massive colorless vector boson , i.e. , @xmath0 , which is the gauge boson associated with additional @xmath2 symmetries .",
    "the renormalizable fcnc interaction can be generally written as follows  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coupling strength and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the projection operators . because of the constraint from the @xmath8 mixing  @xcite , only the right - handed coupling is considered below .    due to the high energy and luminosity at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "abundant top quark events will be produced , so it is a good chance to investigate the same - sign top pair production process .",
    "in fact , from the measurements of the total cross sections , the cms collaboration has already set an upper limit on the parameters of the nonuniversal @xmath0  @xcite , and at the low @xmath0 mass region the atlas collaboration also gave a strong constraint  @xcite .",
    "however , both of these results are based on the leading - order ( lo ) calculations , which suffer from large - scale uncertainties and can not match the expected experimental accuracy at hadron colliders . on the other hand ,",
    "the backgrounds of the process can be further suppressed if we choose a more proper observable , as we will discuss below . in this paper , we present the complete qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the same - sign top pair production and decay ( lepton channel ) mediated by the nonuniversal @xmath0 at the lhc and also investigate the signal and backgrounds of the process at the qcd nlo level .",

    "the @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the amplitudes of the resonance production and its decay , respectively .    however , in our case , the resonance is the top quark , so the process should be separated at the amplitude level . since the intermediate top quark is on - shell  @xcite ,",

    "after all cuts imposed , the @xmath68 dependence is shown in fig.[deltas ] ( right ) . here",
    ", we only show the electron final state as an example .",
    "the soft , collinear and the noncollinear contributions individually depend strongly on the cutoffs .",
    "however , the cutoff dependence in the two contributions ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) nearly cancel each other , so the final results for @xmath124 are almost independent of the cutoffs .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the cms collaboration has set a limit on the parameter @xmath4 and @xmath125 based on the lo calculations . according to our numerical result",

    ", we plot the total cross section and the k factor , defined as @xmath126 , as the function of the @xmath0 boson mass . because of the large negative contributions from the interference between the loop corrections and the born amplitudes , the nlo corrections reduce the cross section .",
    "we can see that the qcd nlo corrections are more significant for larger @xmath0 boson mass .    if the total cross section is fixed to be a certain value , for example 1 pb , we can also plot the @xmath4 parameter as the function of the @xmath0 boson mass , as shown in fig.[crzmass ] .",
    "it is easy to find that , the curve in fig.[crzmass ] is nearly a straight line , when @xmath0 boson mass is larger than about 500 gev .",
    "this means the numerical results can be written in the following form if the @xmath32 decay width(@xmath127 ) is fixed to a certain value , @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are two parameters that depend on the cuts and the center - of - mass energy  ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "then , when @xmath0 boson mass is large enough , i.e. , for @xmath132 and for @xmath133 . since @xmath0 may have other unknown decay channels  @xcite , its total decay width should be larger than the decay width to @xmath134 and @xmath135 . here",

[ fit ] and find that they are fitted well with the numerical results of the total cross sections .    in fig .",
    "[ scale ] we show the scale dependence of the lo and nlo total cross section at the lhc with different parameter values .",
    "we can see that , in all these cases , when the scale(@xmath140 ) varies from 0.5@xmath17 to 2@xmath17 , the nlo corrections reduce the factorization scale(@xmath55 ) dependence significantly . and at the nlo level , the total scale dependence ( @xmath141 ) will increase when @xmath142 increase or @xmath131 decrease . since there is no renormalization scale(@xmath143 ) dependence at lo , the scale dependence is just the facotrization scale dependence at lo , which is also the reason why the total scale dependence ( @xmath141 ) is not reduced significantly at nlo .",
    "we also discuss the uncertainties from the pdf  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf ] . according to our results ,",
    "the pdf uncertainties are @xmath144 , which are almost independent of @xmath131 and @xmath38 .",

    "[ kim ] we show the dependence of the differential distributions on missing energy  ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath147 ( scalar sum of final - state visible particle transverse momenta ) . from fig .",

    "this is due to the fact that the real corrections have additional jet emissions .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the complete qcd nlo corrections to the same - sign top pair production mediated by the nonuniversal @xmath0 including production and decay at the lhc .",
    "our results show that the qcd nlo corrections reduce the total cross sections by more than 10% for @xmath0 boson mass greater than 500 gev and loosen the constraint on the model parameters when comparing with the cms collaboration results .",
    "we also show that the total cross sections , including the qcd nlo corrections , can be expressed as the explicit functions of the model parameters @xmath4 and @xmath125 generally .",
    "these functions may help experimentalists to quickly estimate the cross sections in their studies . besides , the nlo corrections reduce the dependence of the total cross sections on the factorization scale significantly .",
    "we also study the signature and backgrounds of the process at the nlo level . using the difference between the @xmath148 and the @xmath149 as shown in eq.([ob ] ) , we show that , in principle , the @xmath150 and @xmath151 backgrounds can be totally excluded , and the same - sign dilepton signal of the new physics could be discovered more easily .",
