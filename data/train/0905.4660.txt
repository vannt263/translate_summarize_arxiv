    "furthermore , cross terms like @xmath109 become nonzero , signalling that the mass eigenstates are no longer cp eigenstates , as discussed for the njl model in ref .  @xcite . as a consequence , the @xmath14-field mixes with the @xmath87-field and the @xmath15-field mixes with the @xmath110-field .",

    "in the lsm@xmath5 model the quarks start to contribute at nonzero temperatures .",
    "in fact , it is assumed that all the temperature dependence comes from the quarks . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that this approach is more justified for studying high @xmath59 phenomena than considering only thermal fluctuations of the meson fields , because at high @xmath59 constituent quarks become light and mesonic excitations heavy . for the study of the chiral phase transition at @xmath1",

    "there also the effect of a magnetic field was discussed , which we will not take into account .",
    "we are now going to follow the same procedure as for the njl model to study the details of the phase transition .",
    "again , we start the discussion with numerical results of the minimization of the effective potential , this time the results of ref .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ t_dep_cond ] . from this figure ,",
    "two simplifying assumptions can be inferred .",
    "first , as was the case for the njl model , in the neighborhood of the phase transition @xmath72 , allowing eq .   to be expanded in @xmath73 as in eq.([vqt_expansion ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath89 is much smaller than @xmath90 which means that we can neglect the @xmath89-dependence .",
    "this assumption leads to a small error near @xmath117 , but as we checked explicitly this is not important since the structure of the extrema of the potential is not altered .",
    "summing the contributions at zero and nonzero temperature gives the following form for the effective potential @xmath118 where @xmath119 the form of this potential is clearly different from the one of the njl model eq .",
    "( [ vnjl ] ) , the difference being the uncanceled logarithmic term .",
    "this term proportional to @xmath120 will always cause the phase transition to be of first order .",
    "as observed for the njl model , also in this case the potential is exactly the same as the chiral limit at @xmath1 , with @xmath90 replaced by @xmath89 . beyond the chiral limit the explicit symmetry breaking term",
    "@xmath121 ( which has no analogue at @xmath122 ) will change the first order transition into a cross - over , unless the yukawa coupling @xmath114 is increased sufficiently @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the absence of explicit cp violation through a linear term in @xmath90 at @xmath122 lies at the heart of the difference between the observations made here and those in ref.@xcite .    like in the njl model , it is the sign flip of @xmath123 that modifies the structure of the minima .",
    "but instead of a phase transition , now a meta - stable state develops at @xmath124 .",

    "the minimum jumps , signalling a first order transition .    when the parameters of ref",
    ".  @xcite are used , we obtain the following values for the spinodals : 118 mev and 129 mev . to find the exact point of the phase transition , the potential has to be minimized numerically , giving a critical temperature of 126.4 mev . as already noted , this is significantly lower than @xmath127 , but the specific values depend on the parameter choices made . as should be clear from the previous discussion , choosing different parameters would not affect the conclusion about the different orders of the phase transition , at least as long as @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( equivalently , @xmath130 at @xmath69 ) .",
    "as mentioned , the lsm@xmath5 model is a hybrid model for mesons , which are coupled to quarks at nonzero temperature , and the njl model is a quark model , where the bosonic states of quark - antiquark fields are interpreted as mesons .",

    "<S> the cp - restoring phase transition at @xmath0 and high temperature is investigated using two related models that aim to describe the low - energy phenomenology of qcd , the njl model and the linear sigma model coupled to quarks . despite many similarities between the models , different predictions for the order of the phase transition result . using the landau - ginzburg formalism </S>",
    "<S> , the origin of this difference is traced back to a non - analytic vacuum term at zero temperature that is present in the njl model , but usually not included in the linear sigma model . due to the absence of explicit cp violation </S>",
    "<S> , this term always alters the qualitative aspects of the high temperature phase transition at @xmath0 , just as for @xmath1 in the chiral limit .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that there is a possibility of cp violation in the strong interaction due to instanton contributions . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions are incorporated in the qcd lagrangian through the topological @xmath2-term , where @xmath3 is the qcd vacuum angle . </S>",
    "<S> this term violates cp , unless @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath0 is special , because then dashen s phenomenon can occur , i.e. , spontaneous cp violation at @xmath0  @xcite .    from experiments it is known </S>",
    "<S> that in nature @xmath3 is very small  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is unknown and is commonly referred to as the strong cp problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been argued that in heavy - ion collisions meta - stable cp - violating states could be created corresponding to states with an effective @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studying the behavior of the strong interactions at nonzero @xmath3 is therefore of interest and has been done quite extensively using chiral lagrangians , see for example refs  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the @xmath3-dependence of two models describing the chiral dynamics of low energy qcd have been studied , the njl model  @xcite and the linear sigma model coupled to quarks ( lsm@xmath5 )  @xcite . in both models </S>",
    "<S> the effects of instantons are included through an additional interaction , the t hooft determinant interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that both models exhibit dashen s phenomenon , which turns out to be temperature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected , since at high temperature the effects of instantons , which are needed for the cp violation , are exponentially suppressed  @xcite . in both models </S>",
    "<S> the spontaneous cp violation at @xmath0 disappears at a critical temperature between 100 and 200 mev , however , the order of the phase transition differs . in case of the njl model </S>",
    "<S> the transition is of second order , whereas in the lsm@xmath5 model it is of first order . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this difference is important , because a first order transition allows meta - stable phases , in contrast to a second order transition .    </S>",
    "<S> although the njl and lsm@xmath5 model are not the same , they are closely related . </S>",
    "<S> eguchi  @xcite has shown that when the njl model is bosonized , a linear sigma model is obtained ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effects of quarks are treated differently in both models , which was already discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath6 . in the case of the lsm@xmath5 model </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the quarks are usually only taken into account for nonzero temperatures , whereas in the njl model their effects are necessarily incorporated also at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found that the order of the chiral symmetry restoring phase transition at @xmath6 was the same in both models , but the critical temperatures differ . </S>",
    "<S> while the qualitative aspects of the phase transition are similar at @xmath6 , this is not the case for the high temperature cp - restoring phase transition at @xmath0 as we will discuss in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we should mention here that the situation at @xmath6 depends on the amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was observed that when the pion mass is reduced in order to study the chiral limit , neglecting the effects of the quarks at zero temperature can affect the order of the high temperature phase transition at @xmath6 too .    although there is a cp - restoring phase transition at high chemical potential also , in this paper we will restrict to the temperature dependence of this phase transition at @xmath0 , because there the differences between the two models are most pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , the effective potentials of both models are analyzed analytically , which will allow the determination of the order of the phase transitions using standard landau - ginzburg type of arguments . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to numerical results obtained earlier corroborates these conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we will discuss the bosonification procedure of eguchi , which relates the njl model to a linear sigma model and allows us to further pinpoint the origin of the similarities and differences with the lsm@xmath5 model . </S>"
