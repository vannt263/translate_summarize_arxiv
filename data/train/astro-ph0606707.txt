    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are among the most intriguing sources to have been discovered by x - ray satellites .",
    "they are defined as point - like x - ray sources which , if located within the galaxy they are associated with on the sky , are off - nuclear and have x - ray luminosities @xmath1 in the @xmath2kev bandpass @xcite .",
    "this exceeds the theoretical eddington limit for a neutron star or stellar - mass black hole , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the black hole mass and @xmath5 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "it also exceeds the peak in observed x - ray luminosities of known galactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies have revealed that some ulxs can be identified with supernova remnants or background agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . of the remaining unidentified sources , however , rapid x - ray variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectral state transitions @xcite strongly suggest that we are dealing with a population of close interacting binary systems involving accretion onto a black hole .",
    "perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding ulxs is the mass of the black hole , @xmath4 , which determines @xmath6 .",
    "there are at least three possible explanations for why many ulxs are apparently @xmath7 times more luminous than typical galactic black hole xrbs : 1 .",
    "the emission is doppler - boosted by a relativistic jet pointing towards us ( microblazar scenario : e.g. @xcite ) . in this case , @xmath4 need not be more than @xmath8 , similar to typical stellar - mass black holes in the galaxy .",
    "the brightness enhancement is due to a combination of various factors : mild beaming , @xmath4 more massive than typical galactic sources , and super - eddington accretion .",
    "a factor of @xmath9 for each of these terms is physically plausible and would suffice for most ulxs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , mild geometric beaming could result from a sub - relativistic , radiatively - driven disk outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , it could be the result of a relativistic jet pointing slightly away from us ( microquasar scenario ) .",
    "3 . the x - ray emission is isotropic and eddington - limited ; the high luminosity arises from a more massive black hole ( an intermediate - mass black hole , imbh ) , with @xmath10 @xcite . in this case",
    "the x - ray source is truly ultra - luminous , and hence it requires an accretion rate higher than that for a beamed scenario . if ulxs were proven to be powered by an accreting imbh , the implications would be far - reaching , impacting on many other fields , from star - formation to cosmology ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in principle , phase - resolved optical spectroscopic and photometric studies are the most direct way to determine the binary system parameters ( viewing angle , orbital period , radial velocity curve and hence , mass function ",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) and constrain the nature of ulxs .",
    "this is how galactic black holes were first identified .",
    "however , optical counterpart searches and phase - resolved studies have proven exceedingly difficult for ulxs because even the nearest ones are located at distances of a few mpc . moreover",
    ", the brightest ulxs tend to be preferentially located in crowded star forming regions @xcite , making unambiguous optical identifications often impossible , even within the _ chandra _ error circle .",
    "when optical counterparts are found , they are generally consistent with o or b0 stars @xcite . however , this could be a selection effect , since smaller donors ( perhaps lower - mass stars evolving through their giant phase ) would be too faint to be detected . hence , it is important to identify the discriminating signatures of ulxs in other wavebands .",
    "radio observations may provide a more effective means of differentiating the isotropic imbh and beaming models . by analogy with agn",
    ", we can expect a ulx microblazar to produce strong synchrotron radio emission from a compact , unresolved core , while more extended , and possibly elongated and resolved radio structure may arise from a ulx microquasar , seen at larger inclination . to date , radio counterparts have been detected for only a few ulxs : two in m82 @xcite ; one in ngc5408 @xcite ; one in holmbergii @xcite ; one in ngc7424 @xcite ; and one in ngc6946 ( van dyk et al .",
    "1994 ; blair , fesen & schlegel , 2001 ; swartz et al .",
    "2006 , in prep . ) .",
    "it is still unclear whether the emission in those radio sources is due to an underlying supernova remnant or is directly produced by ulx jet activity , either from the core or the lobes .",
    "hence , it is important to determine the radio signatures of different ulx models .    in the x - ray band , ulx spectra",
    "are generally dominated by a power - law , particularly above 1  kev .",
    "a cool thermal component is present in some sources , but contributes at most @xmath11% of the flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a power - law component is also dominant in the x - ray spectra of galactic black holes in two of the canonical spectral states @xcite : the low / hard state , when the photon index is @xmath12 and the x - ray luminosity is @xmath13 ; and the very high ( or steep power - law ) state , when @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the low / hard state ,",
    "the accretion disk is thought to be truncated far from the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , and replaced by a radiatively inefficient flow with a steady jet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the very high state , on the other hand , is characterized by a high radiative efficiency , quasi - periodic x - ray variability , and absence of a steady jet , although flares or sporadic radio ejections are associated with this state .",
    "it is not clear whether ulxs can be classified into either one of these power - law dominated xrb states ; their photon index is somewhat intermediate , with @xmath16 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if they are in a classical low / hard state , their apparent x - ray luminosities suggest masses @xmath17 .",
    "what seems clear is that ulxs are not in a high / soft state , when the x - ray spectrum is dominated by soft disk blackbody emission and the power - law is weaker .",
    "regardless of which spectral state ulxs belong to , the power - law component could be produced either by thermal comptonization in a hot , diffuse corona , or by nonthermal synchrotron and compton processes in a relativsitic jet , or possibly a combination of both ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "although it is widely accepted that relativistic jets are responsible for extragalactic radio sources , analogous jet models for galactic xrbs have only been considered relatively recently ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "existing disk - jet models for binaries , however , either neglect the radio synchrotron properties altogether ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or are only appropriate for the low / hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to explore the possibility of a jet coexisting with ( and coupled to ) a bright disk extending all the way down to the isco ) . ] .    in this paper , we investigate both the radio and x - ray properties of relativistic beaming models for ulxs using an accreting black hole framework generalized to include coupled disk - jet spectral components .",
    "specifically , the radio and hard x - ray emission are produced in a relativistic jet that is magnetically coupled to an accretion disk ( which can contribute to the soft x - ray emission ) .",
    "the jet drains a substantial fraction of the total accretion power from the disk and thus modifies the multi - colour disk spectrum . in order to calculate the spectral energy distribution",
    ", we explicitly model the mechanism which magnetically couples the disk and jet .",
    "thus , our generalized model calculates both the jet and disk spectra _ self - consistently _ for different values of the black hole mass @xmath4 , mass accretion rate @xmath18 , and coupling strength .",
    "this leads to two unique features of the model that have important implications not just for ulxs , but for all accreting systems : 1 .",
    "the nett accretion power can exceed the eddington limit because the jet efficiently channels energy from the disk , which remains sub - eddington ; and 2 .",
    "the presence of a jet can be inferred indirectly from its effects on the disk , which consequently emits a spectrum that can be considerably different from that predicted by the standard shakura - sunyaev @xcite disk in the euv / soft - x - ray bandpass for xrbs .",

    "the model we construct here is based on the generalized accretion disk theory of @xcite , which gives self - consistent solutions for the radiative flux of a turbulent , magnetized accretion disk modified by an outflow that could be either mass - flux or poynting - flux dominated .",
    "a mass - flux dominated outflow requires @xmath18 to vary with radius @xmath19 in the disk .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to modelling a poynting - flux dominated outflow .",
    "the solutions also take into account the possibility of a non - zero magnetic torque acting on the inner boundary , although we do not consider this effect here .",
    "we calculate an outflow - modified multi - colour - disk ( ommcd ) spectrum , assuming each annulus is locally emitting a blackbody . a newtonian potential is used .",
    "the fraction of accretion power removed from the disk by the magnetic torque acting on the surface is channelled into the jet and partitioned into kinetic energy ( bulk and random ) , magnetic field , and radiative energy components .",
    "we calculate the jet spectrum due to synchrotron , synchrotron self - comptonization ( ssc ) and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the disk photons by the energetic electrons in the jet .",
    "we test the micro - blazar / quasar models for ulxs by comparing the theoretical spectra for different values of @xmath4 , @xmath18 , jet power @xmath20 and inclination angle @xmath21 measured relative to the jet axis .",
    "assuming a zero nett torque at the inner disk boundary @xmath22 and no radial variations in the mass accretion rate @xmath18 due to a mass - loaded wind , the radiative flux of a magnetized accretion disk with a non - zero magnetic torque acting on the disk surface is ( * ? ? ?",

    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath57 .",
    "the value @xmath54 is used to demonstrate how the change in radial flux profile affects the integrated spectrum .",
    "the ommcd model predicts a decrease in the temperature profile at small radii , compared with the standard ss disk model ( fig .  1 , top panel ) .",
    "therefore , the peak in the integrated spectrum comes from larger radii and occurs at lower energies , for a given @xmath18 , as @xmath37 increases . for a given accretion rate and black hole mass",
    ", the ommcd spectrum appears softer and cooler than a standard disk , and its spectral slope can be flatter than the characteristic @xmath58 slope of a standard disk spectrum ( fig .  1 , bottom panel ) .",
    "physically , this occurs because the magnetic disk - jet coupling mechanism is strongest at small @xmath19 ; in the inner disk , more energy is removed from the disk and used to power a jet .",
    "phenomenologically , this effect could be modelled in terms of a spectral hardening factor @xmath59 .",
    "it has the opposite effect as the hardening factor @xmath49 sometimes introduced to account for comptonization of disk emission @xcite .",
    "observationally , the ommcd model predicts an anticorrelation between the maximum disk temperature , @xmath60 , and the contribution of the hard power - law component , for a fixed @xmath61 , @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it provides an alternative mechanism for producing cooler , fainter disks , having a somewhat similar effect as higher black hole masses and lower accretion rates .",
    "this may be relevant for the spectral fitting of some ulxs where an unusually soft x - ray component ( @xmath62kev ) has been interpreted as disk emission from an imbh ( see e.g. @xcite ; but see also @xcite and @xcite for alternative interpretations of this soft component ) .",
    "we defer a more detailed investigation of the implications of our ommcd model for ulx mass estimates to future work ( soria & kuncic 2006 , in preparation ) .    more generally , taking into account disk cooling in the presence of a jet can be important for correct spectral fitting of ulxs as well as galactic xrbs .",
    "we emphasize that in the ommcd model , the inner disk is not truncated or replaced by a radiatively - inefficient flow ; therefore , the gravitational energy of the inflow is not lost via advection but is mostly transferred to the jet and then partly radiated with a nonthermal spectrum in the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ energy band .",
    "drainage of the disk power may explain why most ulxs seem to be dominated by a relatively hard power - law component in the x - ray band even at luminosities @xmath63 ; in fact , none of the brightest ulxs have ever been observed in a disk - dominated spectral state analagous to the high / soft state of galactic xrbs ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this issue ) .",

    "the signal - to - noise ratio is not high enough for multi - component fitting , but even in sources with a high count rate , additional components ( often attributed to thermal disk emission ) contribute typically less than @xmath126% to the observed flux @xcite .    according to the currently prevailing interpretation of spectral states in galactic xrbs ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , the low / hard state is accompanied by a steady jet and disk truncation at radii much larger than the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ; this state occurs at low accretion rates ( @xmath169 ) and corresponding luminosities @xmath170 .",

    "if ulxs are analogous to galactic xrbs in their low / hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then extrapolation of their x - ray luminosities implies black hole masses @xmath17 ; it is still not known how such imbhs can form and whether they are consistent with the observed ulx population .",
    "we have instead suggested that ulxs behave more as if they are in a `` high / hard '' state , with @xmath171 , even though @xmath172 . in other words , with a high accretion rate and gravitational energy released all the way down to the isco , where it is mostly transferred to a steady jet or corona rather than being locally dissipated and radiated by the disk .",
    "this is different from the high / soft state , in which the jet appears to be suppressed .",
    "it also differs from the very high ( or steep power - law ) state that sometimes accompanies the transition in xrbs from the low / hard to high / soft state @xcite ; the very high state is characterized by sporadic radio ejections and an x - ray power - law spectrum steeper than those generally measured in bright ulxs . more generally , our ommcd model offers a much needed alternative to the truncated disk model for an increasing number of sources characterized by a distinctive hard power - law component , together with evidence that the accretion flow extends all the way down to the isco @xcite .",
    "we predict that , at the typical signal - to - noise level available for most x - ray spectra of ulxs ( generally @xmath149 counts even for the brightest sources ) , the modified disk spectral component may or may not be detectable depending on the relative importance of the jet ( the parameter @xmath122 in our model ) and that a low disk temperature may be the result of `` jet cooling '' rather than an implausibly high black hole mass . in the calculations presented here",
    ", we set @xmath127 to produce a dominant nonthermal hard x - ray spectral component . to increase the relative contribution of the disk emission to @xmath61 , as appears to be required for some ulxs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can decrease the ratio @xmath37 of accretion power being diverted into the jet .",
    "the observable disk quantity @xmath60 ( approximately corresponding to the annulus with the maximum flux contribution ) also depends on the parameter @xmath173 , which determines the radial profile of the magnetic torque responsible for jet formation , as defined in ( [ e : q ] ) .",
    "we have set @xmath54 in the calculations here . a steeper profile ( e.g. @xmath174 ) removes more energy from small @xmath19 and less energy from large @xmath19 , thereby decreasing the x - ray brightness of the disk for a fixed @xmath18 .",
    "thus , to produce ulx spectra with a soft , thermal component in addition to the hard nonthermal component , as is sometimes observed , we can decrease @xmath37 in a suitable way to reproduce the observed fraction of radiative power emitted by the disk , and then vary @xmath173 to increase or decrease @xmath60 . in general , the radial profile of the magnetic torque does not have to be a scale - free power - law ; we intend to explore different profiles in future work . for practical purposes ,",
    "the ommcd spectrum can also be approximated by a standard disk with an empirical hardening factor @xmath175 applied to the fitted colour temperature .",
    "it is interesting to consider the implications of our model for the interpretation of spectral states in galactic black hole xrbs .",
    "there is increasing evidence from detailed monitoring of individual sources ( e.g. xtej1550@xmath176564 , @xcite ; cygx-1 , @xcite ; gx339@xmath1764 @xcite ) that changes in @xmath18 can not solely be responsible for spectral state transitions and that an additional parameter is required to explain the full scope of observed spectral behaviour in xrbs .",
    "the additional parameter in our model is @xmath37 , which measures the degree of magnetic coupling between disk and jet / corona .",
    "we expect that @xmath37 is approximately independent of @xmath18 for the following reason . from eqns .",
    "( [ e : fj ] ) , ( [ e : pa ] ) and ( [ e : pj ] ) , we have @xmath177 , since @xmath178 .",
    "the magnetic field in the disk is amplified by the fluid shear and becomes dynamically important when @xmath179 @xcite .",

    ", @xmath37 is independent of @xmath18 and is an increasing function of @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that for a given @xmath18 , more massive accretors can extract a larger fraction of total accretion power from the bulk fluid flow to produce more powerful jets .",
    "our model thus predicts that , contrary to the standard model for xrbs , steady jets need not necessarily be quenched in a high state and that sources such as ulxs which appear to be in a high _ and _ hard state are likely to have masses at the high - end of the xrb mass scale .",
    "this prediction is also supported by observations of agn with @xmath183 : radio - loud quasars tend to have black hole masses at the high end of the supermassive black hole mass scale ( i.e. @xmath184 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , while narrow - line seyfert1s ( with @xmath185 ) are preferentially radio - quiet ( see * ? ? ?",

    "finally , it is worth reminding the reader here that we have worked in a newtonian potential .",
    "relativistic effects will change the radial disk flux profile at small @xmath19 and may restrict the choice of @xmath173 and @xmath122 .",
    "this may provide further theoretical constraints on the ulx models considered here .",
    "a full relativistic derivation of the ommcd model is beyond the scope of this paper , but will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our results show that beamed emission from a relativistic jet in a stellar - mass black hole binary system can produce an exceptionally bright x - ray source with a @xmath88kev luminosity that is consistent with ulxs .",
    "the predicted x - ray spectra for the microblazar and microquasar scenarios have different distinguishing properties .",
    "in particular , the microblazar model ( where the jet is viewed close to our line of sight ) predicts a spectrum that becomes increasingly flatter towards hard x - ray energies in the @xmath88kev bandpass , due to comptonization effects ( see fig .",
    "[ f : mblazar ] ) . the observed spectrum of once - scattered disk photons rises to a peak just beyond the _ chandra_/_xmm - newton _ bandpass .",
    "the power - law component of this beamed inverse compton emission falls in the gamma - ray band .",
    "it is difficult to rule out or confirm possible comptonization effects from currently available ulx spectra ( @xcite ; see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we do note , however , that some evidence for spectral curvature towards hard x - ray energies has recently emerged in _ xmm - newton _ ulx spectra with high photon counts @xcite .",
    "the microquasar model , on the other hand , predicts a power - law x - ray spectrum due to beamed synchrotron self - comptonization and thus offers a viable alternative to thermal comptonization in a corona .",
    "the predicted radio properties of the micro - blazar / quasar models are similar : the spectra are approximately flat near @xmath186ghz and the specific radio luminosities are @xmath187 , corresponding to @xmath188jy at @xmath189mpc . how do these predicted radio properties compare to those observed ?",
    "very few radio counterparts of ulxs have been found so far , down to detection limits @xmath190 .",
    "the very low detection rates resulting from radio counterpart searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) strongly suggest that the vast majority of ulxs are intrinsically weak radio sources .",
    "indeed , the ratio of radio - to - x - ray powers , @xmath191 @xcite , predicted by our spectral modelling is @xmath192 for both the microblazar and microquasar cases ( see table  [ t : params ] ) .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude below the peak radio - to - x - ray power ratio observed in galactic xrbs @xcite .",
    "note , however , this also implies that a low measured value of @xmath193 for ulxs with a radio counterpart can not be used to rule out relativistic beaming ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our results imply that if the radio emission arises from synchrotron radiation in a relativistic jet , then ulxs should be too faint to be detected by current radio surveys .",
    "the few radio sources found associated with ulxs to date have specific radio powers @xmath194 and steep radio spectra : @xmath195 for the ulx in ngc  5408 @xcite , @xmath196 for the ulx in ho  ii @xcite and @xmath197 for ulx2 in ngc  7424 @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence that the observed radio emission is marginally resolved ( extended over @xmath198pc ) in two of those sources ( ngc  5408 and ho  ii ) and for all the radio counterparts found so far , the ulx lies in an active star - forming region .",
    "the high flux , steep spectral index and possible spatial resolution suggest that those detected radio sources are not directly associated with a relativistic jet , but instead probably result from optically - thin emission from radio lobes or a radio snr located near the ulx @xcite or even a combination of both ( e.g. a scaled - up version of the galactic source ss433 ; @xcite ) .    in the case of the radio lobe interpretation",
    ", the low detection rate can be attributed to the local ism environment , which may be sufficiently less dense than the igm that adiabatic losses are favoured over synchrotron losses in the jet lobes .",
    "this may explain the paucity of radio lobes in galactic xrbs relative to those commonly seen in radio galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the theoretical radio and x - ray luminosities predicted by our relativistic beaming model for ulxs are remarkably consistent with the `` fundamental plane '' correlation between radio and x - ray emission and black hole mass @xcite .",
    "this is surprising for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the theoretical relation derived by @xcite assumes optically - thin x - ray emission and neglects differences in radio and x - ray beaming ( i.e. equivalent to our microquasar spectral model ) .",
    "it is not immediately obvious why the relation should hold if part of the x - ray emission is optically - thick , as is the case for our microblazar model .",
    "secondly , the empirical relation found by @xcite , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath199 ( where @xmath200 denotes radio power at the observing frequency , @xmath201 ) , strictly only holds for sources in a low state ; it is still unclear to what extent it holds or breaks down for sources which are in a high state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "current observational evidence suggests that most of the x - ray emission from ulxs does not come directly from the accretion disk , which is either not directly visible , or colder than in bright stellar - mass xrbs .",
    "we have used a coupled disk+jet theoretical framework to explain why most of the energy is not directly radiated from the disk , and to test whether a relativistic beaming scenario ( microblazar or microquasar ) is consistent with the observed x - ray and radio spectra .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    the accretion disk can be substantially modified by the presence of a magnetized jet ; this gives rise not only to a modified disk spectrum , but also to a decrease in the peak colour temperature ( @xmath60 ) of the inner disk for a fixed mass accretion rate .",
    "the modified disk+jet model thus predicts an anticorrelation between the relative importance of hard ( jet ) and soft ( disk ) x - ray spectral components .",
    "we confirm that both the stellar - mass microblazar and microquasar scenarios can produce apparent x - ray luminosities in the ulx regime ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "a general feature of our disk+jet model is that it can produce hard , nonthermal x - ray spectra that are analogous to the classic low / hard spectral state in xrbs , but applicable to high mass accretion rates ( @xmath203 ) and , therefore , high luminosity sources . in our model ,",
    "a magnetic torque provides the mechanism for transferring a substantial fraction of the total accretion power @xmath171 from the disk to the jet ( i.e. @xmath204 ) .",
    "our spectral model for the microblazar predicts a substantially hardened x - ray spectrum due to strong beaming and comptonization effects .",
    "the microquasar model , on the other hand , produces a featureless power - law spectrum .",
    "both the microblazar and microquasar models predict that , despite the beaming effects , ulxs are intrinsically weak radio emitters .",
    "this result is compatible with the overwhelming excess of non - detections over detections in ulx radio observations to date .",
    "neither of the beaming models are consistent with the few ulx radio counterpart detections reported to date .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed radio emission can not be attributed to beamed synchrotron emission in a relativistic jet .",
    "we suggest it is likely due to radio lobes or a radio snr .",
    "we predict that deeper observations around 20ghz should in principle detect a change in radio spectral index , thus resolving the direct jet contribution from the lobe emission .    in this paper ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to modelling beamed emission from accreting black holes with masses in the known stellar - mass range ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "if imbhs exist , it is legitimate to assume ( based on the stellar - mass and supermassive black hole analogies ) that some imbhs can also possess relativistic jets .",
    "if some imbhs have beamed emission , then we would expect to find at least a few milliblazars and milliquasars with apparent x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath206 .",
    "such sources have not yet been seen .",
    "the disk+jet model we have proposed here requires that more gravitational energy is channelled into a jet than is radiated by a disk , at least during some phases of accretion . at low or moderate accretion rates ,",
    "new evidence of significant feedback onto the ism surrounding accreting black holes indicates that jets can indeed carry away much more energy than is radiated by the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at accretion rates approaching the eddington rate , however ,",
    "observations suggest that jets are quenched in galactic xrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and in low - mass agn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but can persist in agn with high black hole masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our model predicts that the fractional accretion power chanelled into jets scales with black hole mass and is independent of the mass accretion rate .",
    "it therefore predicts that jets can be the dominant energy carrier , even at high ( @xmath207 eddington ) accretion rates .",
    "if this is correct , it should be possible to find evidence of relativistic jet emission also in some other accreting black hole sources in which the hard x - ray component has perhaps been misinterpreted as , for example , thermal comptonization in a corona .",

    "<S> we calculate the broadband radio  x - ray spectra predicted by microblazar and microquasar models for ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , exploring the possibility that their dominant power - law component is produced by a relativistic jet , even at near - eddington mass accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by first constructing a generalized disk  jet theoretical framework in which some fraction of the total accretion power @xmath0 is efficiently removed from the accretion disk by a magnetic torque responsible for jet formation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for different black hole masses , mass accretion rates and magnetic coupling strength , we self - consistently calculate the relative importance of the modified disk spectrum , as well as the overall jet emission due to synchrotron and compton processes . </S>",
    "<S> in general , transferring accretion power to a jet makes the disk fainter and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass accretion rate ; this may explain why the soft spectral component appears less prominent than the dominant power - law component in most bright ulxs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the apparent x - ray luminosity and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are consistent with the observed properties of most ulxs . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the radio synchrotron jet emission is too faint to be detected at the typical threshold of radio surveys to date . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the high rate of non - detections over detections in radio counterpart searches . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with a few ulxs can not be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet .    </S>",
