    "in recent years , the process of the false vacuum decay with the effect of gravity has been studied extensively in the context of the one - bubble open inflation scenario , in which an open universe is created in a nucleated bubble formed through false vacuum decay@xcite . in this context",
    ", we are interested in the spectrum of quantum fluctuations after the bubble nucleation because it determines the spectrum of primordial fluctuations of the universe . by comparing the predicted spectrum with the observed one",
    ", we can test whether a certain model is viable or not .",
    "the fluctuation can be decomposed by using the spatial harmonics in an open universe .",
    "we denote the eigen value of the spatial harmonics by @xmath0 .",
    "the spatial harmonics with positive @xmath0 are square integrable on a time constant hypersurface in an open universe , and we have a continuous spectrum for @xmath1 . while , the spatial harmonics are no longer square integrable when the eigen value @xmath0 is negative . however , since any time constant hypersurface in an open universe is not a cauchy surface , this divergence does not directly prohibit the existence of such a mode . by considering the normalization of perturbation modes on an appropriate cauchy surface , we find that the spectrum for @xmath2 can exist as a discrete one , which we call supercurvature mode@xcite .",
    "further , we classified the modes with negative @xmath0 into two classes depending on their eigen values .",
    "one is supercritical modes with @xmath3 and the other is subcritical modes with @xmath4 . if and only if there exist supercritical modes , the two - point correlation function of the tunneling field unboundedly increases for large spatial separation in the open universe created in the nucleated bubble .",
    "the diverging correlation for large spatial separation does not seem to be allowed intuitively .",
    "furthermore , it is known that we meet a trouble in constructing homogeneous fluctuations for supercritical modes except for some restricted cases@xcite .",
    "hence , we proposed the `` no - supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture '' , which is the conjecture claiming that the existence of supercritical supercurvature modes should be prohibited in realistic models of creation of an open universe@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is an unsolved problem in the euclidean path integral approach to describe the phenomena of the true vacuum bubble nucleation with the effect of gravity through quantum tunneling@xcite .",
    "that is the so - called negative mode problem@xcite . in the lowest wkb approximation ,",
    "the quantum tunneling is described by a bounce solution@xcite .",
    "the decay rate per unit volume and per unit time interval , @xmath5 , is given by the formula @xmath6 where @xmath7 is",
    "the classical euclidean action for the bounce solution and @xmath8 is that for the trivial solution that stays in the false vacuum . in the path integral",
    "approach , the prefactor @xmath9 is evaluated by taking the imaginary part of the gaussian integral over fluctuations around the background bounce solution . for an ordinary system without gravity , there is one perturbation mode in which direction the action does not decrease .",
    "it is called negative mode .",
    "the existence of an unique negative mode has already proved for quantum fields in flat spacetime@xcite . in evaluating this gaussian integral ,",
    "the path of integration is deformed on the complex plane to make the integral well - defined . as a result , one imaginary factor , @xmath10 , appears in @xmath11 . in the euclidean path integral",
    "approach to the tunneling , this imaginary unit plays a crucial role when we interpret @xmath5 as the decay rate .",
    "however , in the case where gravity is taken into account , the situation is different . in this case , the tunneling is described by the @xmath12-symmetric coleman and de luccia ( cd ) bounce solution@xcite . in reducing the action for fluctuations around the @xmath12-symmetric cd bounce solution , we used the standard gauge fixing method to deal with gauge degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "then , we obtained the reduced action that retains only the physical degrees of freedom@xcite . reflecting",
    "the fact that the action with gravitational degrees of freedom is unbounded below , the reduced action for the fluctuations that conserve the @xmath12-symmetry has an unusual overall signature . to treat this system",
    ", we proposed to use the prescription similar to the conformal rotation@xcite .",
    "then , from path integral measure , there arise one imaginary unit @xmath10 . hence , in order to obtain a correct number of @xmath10 , i.e. , one , it seems that there should exist no - negative mode .",
    "therefore , we proposed the `` no - negative mode conjecture '' .",
    "we have shown in our previous paper@xcite that the existence of supercritical supercurvature modes is equivalent to the existence of negative modes .",
    "that is , if we obtain a proof of the `` no - negative mode conjecture '' , the `` no - supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture '' is also proved .",
    "henceforce , the issue if the `` no - negative mode conjecture '' is true or not is now of increasing importance . in the same paper@xcite",
    ", we have shown that this conjecture holds in a certain restricted situation . in the present paper",
    ", we give a proof of this conjecture for rather general models which consist of one scalar field .",
    "here , we briefly describe the statement proved in the present paper . here",
    ", we should note that not all cd bounce solutions contribute to the tunneling process .",
    "the relevant contribution to the decay rate comes only from the bounce solution that realizes the minimum value of action among all non - trivial solutions .",
    "thus , the statement that we should prove is the following : `` there is no - negative mode for the cd bounce solution that realizes the minimum value of action among all non - trivial solutions . ''",
    "however , making a list of all the cd bounce solutions , we find that there are many solutions for which the tunneling field does not change monotonically .",
    "these solutions have more than two concentric domain walls .",
    "we expect that the simplest bounce solution with one - domain wall will dominate the tunneling process .",
    "hence , one may want to strengthen the conjecture as follows ; for the bounce solution that gives the minimum value of action , the tunneling field @xmath13 changes monotonically , and this solution have no - negative mode .",
    "we refer to this version of conjecture as the `` no - negative mode theorem '' .",
    "we used the word ",
    "theorem instead of ` conjecture ' because this statement is proved in the this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explain the `` no - negative mode theorem '' in more detail . in section iii , we present a prescription to search for all cd bounce solutions . in section iv , we give a method to count the number of negative modes for a given cd bounce solution . in section",
    "v , we give a method to count the multiplicity of domain walls contained in a given soltion . in section",
    "vi , we give a method to compare the values of action between various cd bounce solutions for a given potential model . in section vii , combining the results obtained in sec .",
    "iv , v and vi , we prove the `` no - negative mode theorem '' .",
    "we summarize the outline of the proof and discuss the implication of this theorem in section viii .",
    "in this section , we explain the statement , which we call the `` no - negative mode theorem '' , in more detail to clarify what we are going to prove .",
    "we consider the system composed of a scalar field , @xmath14 , with the einstein gravity .",
    "the euclidean action is given by @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the ricci curvature .",
    "the potential of the scalar field is assumed to have the form as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , and initially the field is trapped in the false vacuum .",
    "we set @xmath18 at the top of the potential barrier and we denote the bottoms in the false and true vacua by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 vanishes only at @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "the bounce solution is an euclidean solution which connects the configurations before and after tunneling . in the present case , before tunneling the geometry is given by the de sitter space and the scalar field is in the false vacuum . after tunneling",
    ", there appears a true vacuum bubble in the false vacuum sea . under the assumption of the @xmath12-symmetry , @xmath23",
    "the corresponding bounce solution is found by coleman and de luccia@xcite . with this assumption",
    ", the euclidean action reduces to @xmath24 ,   \\label{newaction}\\ ] ]    [ fig1 ]    where @xmath25 represents the differentiation with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the value of @xmath26 at both boundaries .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for definiteness , we assume that @xmath13 is in the true ( false ) vacuum side at @xmath31 . due to this restriction",
    ", we do not take account of solutions in which @xmath13 is in the same vacuum side at both boundaries .",
    "the euclidean equations of motion are obtained by taking the variation of @xmath32 . after taking variations",
    ", we adopt the synchronous gauge by setting @xmath33 , for simplicity . the differentiation with respect to @xmath34",
    "gives a constraint equation , @xmath35 from the variation with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath36 , we obtain the equations of motion , @xmath37 where we also used the constraint equation ( [ frweq ] ) to write the equation in the form as given in ( [ doth ] ) .",
    "we refer to the above two equations , ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ doth ] ) , as the background equations . requiring the regularity at both boundaries , the boundary conditions to be satisfied by the background solutions",
    "are determined as @xmath38 recently , hawking and turok proposed to relax these boundary conditions to allow singular instantons@xcite . however , the interpretation of singular instantons is still an unsettled issue@xcite .",
    "here we do not consider this possibility .",
    "now , we consider fluctuations around this bounce solution , to examine the prefactor @xmath11 that arises in the estimate of the decay rate . as",
    "briefly noted in introduction , the number of @xmath10 in the prefactor @xmath11 is important in the path integral approach . to evaluate the number of @xmath10",
    ", we need to obtain the reduced action for the fluctuations around the bounce solution .",
    "especially , @xmath12-symmetric perturbations @xmath39 are most important .",
    "after an appropriate gauge fixing , we obtain the reduced action for @xmath12-symmetric perturbations as@xcite @xmath40 ,   \\label{action2}\\ ] ] with the potential @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath12-symmetric part of the gauge invariant variable introduced in ref .",

    "@xcite , perturbations in terms of original variables are written down in the newton gauge as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "a distinguishable feature of the reduced action for @xmath12-symmetric perturbations is that the coefficient in front of @xmath49 becomes negative .",

    "the above integration becomes well - defined .",

    "if there is no mode which has a negative eigen value , there arises no additional imaginary unit factor .",
    "then , the prefactor @xmath11 becomes imaginary .",
    "thus , we conjectured that there should not be any negative mode for the system including the gravitational degrees of freedom , in ref",
    ".  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can show that , if there is no - negative mode in @xmath12-symmetric perturbations , it is also the case for the other perturbation modes . hence , it is sufficient to concentrate on @xmath12-symmetric perturbations .    as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can construct models of cd bounce solutions which possess negative modes .",
    "hence , we can not prove the absence of negative modes for arbitrary models of cd bounce solutions .",
    "however , as mentioned in introduction , the important point is that not all cd bounce solutions contribute to the tunneling process .",
    "the bounce solution that determines the decay rate is the one that realizes the minimum value of action among all bounce solutions . here , we strictly define the `` no - negative mode theorem '' , a proof of which we are going to present in this paper .",
    "* the main theorem * ( the no - negative mode theorem ) :",
    "we develop a method to construct a complete list of @xmath12-symmetric cd bounce solutions in this section . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a diagram consisting of two curves .",
    "we show that each intersection point of these curves corresponds to a cd bounce solution .    in solving the background equations , if we fix the boundary value of @xmath13 at one side , say @xmath57 at @xmath58 , the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) completely determines the initial condition to solve the equations of motion , ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ doth ] ) .",
    "then , solving eqs .",
    "( [ feq ] ) and ( [ doth ] ) from both sides to the maximum radius , we obtain functions which satisfy the background equations in the respective half euclidean regions . we denote them by @xmath59 where the subscript @xmath60 is attached with the variables that are used in solving the background equations from the true ( false ) vacuum side .",
    "when we solve the background equations from @xmath61 , the initial condition is varied by sweeping @xmath62 between the true vacuum minimum and the top of the potential , i.e. , @xmath63 . while , when we solve them from @xmath64 , @xmath65 is sweeped between the false vacuum minimum and the top of the potential , i.e. , @xmath66 .    here , we move the origin of the @xmath26-coordinate to the point corresponding to the maximum radius , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 is determined by solving @xmath68 , and becomes a function of @xmath69 .",
    "further , we define two functions of @xmath69 by the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 at @xmath72",
    ". we refer to them as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , where the subscript @xmath75 is used in the same manner as before",
    ".    then , as shown in fig.[fig2]@xmath76 , the points @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80 draw two curves , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , on the @xmath83-plane as @xmath84 and @xmath85 are sweeped .",

    "we refer to the curves moving in the opposite direction as @xmath95 . : _ each of the curves @xmath96 does not intersect with itself_. and @xmath97 by connecting points @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . by the same reasoning",
    ", we can also prove that @xmath100 does not intersect with @xmath101 . ]",
    "if it were the case , we would have the same final values of @xmath13 and @xmath102 at @xmath72 for different solutions .",
    "however , the background equations can be solved reversely from @xmath72 , and the evolution is uniquely determined .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "@xmath103 : _ all intersection points between @xmath104 and @xmath90 correspond to cd bounce solutions . @xmath105an exceptional case is the hawking moss instanton corresponding to @xmath106 _ we set @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "then , the values and the first derivatives of @xmath111 are continuous at @xmath72 for intersection points . with the aid of eq.([frweq ] ) we find that @xmath112 is also continuous at @xmath72 .",
