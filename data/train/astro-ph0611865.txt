    "we used the r831 grating in gmos and prior to sky subtraction in the final data frames an instrumental velocity resolution of @xmath1219.8@xmath133.4  km  s@xmath14 was measured from gaussian fits to several sky emission lines in the ifu data .",

    "the r@xmath11 and rg610 filters were used to limit the overlap of spectra that results from using the ifu in the two - slit mode configuration with a high spectral resolution setting . unfortunately , because of the overlap of spectra from the two slits , the [ o  i ] features were contaminated and we were unable to extract accurate scientific information from these emission lines .",

    "the velocity centroid and velocity dispersion of the emission line profiles are often used to derive more detailed information on the kinematics of hh jets ( riera et al .",
    "we have derived the barycentric velocity from the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] 6716   emission line profiles at each spatial position in our ifu datacube ( figure 6 ) . from this analysis",
    "we find that the [ s  ii ] heliocentric radial velocity has an approximately constant value of @xmath20105  km  s@xmath14 , along most of the central axis of the hh 34 jet .",
    "the most strongly blueshifted radial velocity of @xmath3 @xmath20116  km  s@xmath14 is found at the central position of knot e. at larger distances from the source ( knots f , g and j ) the radial velocity along the central axis remains approximately constant , with values oscillating between @xmath20105 and @xmath20110  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the h@xmath0 heliocentric radial velocity ( figure 6 ) has a constant velocity along the central axis of the hh 34 jet , with a mean value of @xmath2085  km  s@xmath14 , this is similar to the velocity of the `` fast '' component detected by brke et al .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note that the velocity barycenter is a measurement of the weighted centroid of the profile and information from multiple emission components is not well represented . from figure 3",
    "we found that the h@xmath0 emission profile is double - peaked in many regions .",
    "this profile is shifting the value of the velocity barycenter toward the slower emission component and thus the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] 6716   emission lines have slightly different velocity centroids ( by @xmath1220  km  s@xmath14 ) .    along the hh  34 jet axis ,",
    "both the h@xmath0 and the [ s  ii ]  6716    line barycenter velocities show a series of velocity minima ; the velocity in each of the inter - knot regions is slightly less negative than at the positions of the knots .",
    "the most significant difference is seen in the velocity map for [ s  ii ]  6716    in the knot e - f region ; the velocity in the e knot is @xmath21@xmath23  km  s@xmath14 and the interknot region has @xmath21@xmath24  km  s@xmath14 . over the jet region sampled , the average difference between the maxima and minima of the barycenter velocity along the jet axis is @xmath25  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "deprojecting for an orientation angle of @xmath26 ( between the jet axis and the plane of the sky , see heathcote & reipurth 1992 ) , the intrinsic difference is @xmath27  km  s@xmath14 between the peaks and valleys of the axial barycenter velocity .",
    "perpendicular to the jet axis , both the h@xmath0 and the [ s  ii ]  6716    line barycenters show a decrease to less blueshifted velocities .",
    "the difference between the axial velocities and the velocities at the outer edge of the detected jet beam are @xmath28  km  s@xmath14 ( corresponding to a deprojected @xmath29  km  s@xmath14 ) .",
    "similar `` center - to - limb '' velocity drops are seen both for jet cross sections taken through the peaks of the knots as well as for cuts across the inter - knot regions .",
    "these velocity drops occur over distances of @xmath30 from the jet axis ( corresponding to @xmath31  au at the distance of hh  34 ) .",
    "the velocity structure is similar on each side of the outflow axis , we have found no evidence for systematic asymmetries in the barycenter velocities along the cross - jet direction , though some individual knots do show side - to - side barycenter velocity asymmetries ( e.g. figure 6 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ]  6716    velocity dispersion maps of the collimated jet .",
    "the h@xmath0 line is generally broader than the [ s  ii ]  6716    line , but the dispersions of both lines have similar properties .",
    "the velocity width shows several maxima and minima along the axis of the jet and moving away from the exciting source ( which is off the panel to the right in figure 7 ) .",
    "the dispersion minima coincide with the positions of the knots , and the maxima with the inter - knot regions .",
    "the difference in velocity dispersions along the jet axis is @xmath32  km  s@xmath14 ( similar to the corresponding variations in the barycenter velocity , see above ) . from figure 7",
    ", we have also found that the velocity dispersion typically grows away from the central axis of the hh  34 jet .",
    "the emission profile cross sections have a @xmath33  km  s@xmath14 increase from the axis to the limb of the detected jet ( @xmath30 distant ) .",
    "the integrated intensity maps of the [ s  ii ] 6716 , 6731   and h@xmath0 emission lines were constructed by summing each line in the data cube over its wavelength extent . from these , we have made [ s  ii ] ( 6716 + 6731)/h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] 6716/6731 emission line ratio maps ( shown in figure 8) .",
    "the [ s  ii ] 6716/6731 ratio is a direct diagnostic of the electron density of the emitting gas , and the [ s  ii ] ( 6716 + 6731)/h@xmath0 ratio is a measure of the excitation state of the gas and can be used to estimate the values of the shock velocity that dominate the emission along a given line of sight .",
    "we have constructed the corresponding map of the electron density structure seen in the collimated jet by using the [ s  ii ]  6716/6731 line ratios to solve the 5-level atom problem .",
    "we assumed a uniform electron temperature of @xmath34  k in the emitting region and used the nebular.temden routine in iraf to calculate the densities .",
    "the [ s  ii ]  6716/6731 and [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 line ratio maps show spatial structure along the direction of the outflow ( upper panels of figure 8) .",
    "the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratio map has several maxima and minima along the jet axis , as well as a general trend of increasing [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios with distance from the outflow source ( off the panels to the right in figure 8) .",
    "this was first discovered in the longslit spectra presented by cohen & jones ( 1987 ) .",
    "the e knot shows a ratio value of 5 - 6 , whereas the j knot region has values of 8 - 10 .",
    "knot i appears to have significant spatial structure in the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 line ratio in the direction perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "the relatively large values of the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratio imply that the excitation of the jet is rather low ( cohen & jones 1987 ; bhrke , mundt & ray 1988 ) .",
    "however , some of the values measured from our observations are significantly larger than the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios reported by cohen & jones ( 1987 ) and bhrke , mundt & ray ( 1988 ) .",
    "perhaps the most striking variation in the line ratios are the curious `` striped '' or `` banded '' structures seen in the [ s  ii ]  6716/6731 map ( figure 8) .",
    "the line ratio shows pronounced oscillations , with higher values in the regions to the right of each of the intensity peaks and minima to the left of the successive knots .",
    "larger line ratio values correspond to lower electron densities in the emitting regions , and smaller values correspond to larger densities .",
    "these observations show convincingly that higher electron densities are found in each of the e through j knots toward the left of the emission peaks .",
    "the locations of higher n@xmath35 correspond to the leading edges of the bow shocks , and the minima are found in the trailing sides of the bow shocks , in the `` down - flow '' direction ( the exciting source is off the field to the right in figure 8) .",
    "the largest variation in line ratio is seen in knots i and j. the [ s  ii ] ratios are @xmath31.20 to the right of the knots , and they decrease to values of @xmath30.65 and @xmath30.85 toward the left sides of knots i and j , respectively .",
    "the decrease of the [ s  ii ] ratio from @xmath31.20 to @xmath30.65 seen across knot i from right to left implies an abrupt increase of the electron density of the emitting gas from @xmath3 180 @xmath36 in the trailing region to 1800 @xmath36 at the leading side of the emission knot . in knots",
    "e , i and j , the higher electron density regions have approximately symmetric , bow - shaped structures .",
    "the f and g knots both show density maxima that are spatially offset toward alternating sides of the jet axis .    from the position - velocity cubes of the [ s  ii ] 6716 ,",
    "6731   emission we have generated the electron density channel maps shown in figure 9 . in each of the channel maps , the electron density also shows the structure of `` bands '' that span the width of the hh 34 jet , as seen in figure 8 from the integrated electron density .",
    "the @xmath1 channel maps at heliocentric velocities from @xmath20150 to @xmath2060 km s@xmath14 show very clearly that the high electron density regions correspond to the leading side ( left ) of each of the knots .",
    "comparison of the different channel maps presented in figure 9 shows that the @xmath1 of the low density region increases as the radial velocity becomes less blueshifted ( from the low - limit value of @xmath3160 @xmath36 at @xmath21@xmath12 @xmath20150 km s@xmath14 up to @xmath3350 @xmath36 at @xmath21@xmath12 @xmath2060 km s@xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 values of the highest density regions remain almost constant at @xmath372000 @xmath36 for radial velocities ranging from @xmath20120 to @xmath2060 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the p - v diagrams from the observations of bhrke , mundt & ray ( 1988 ) showed that the [ s  ii ] emission in the e - k knots have two velocity components .",
    "the brighter emission component was at about @xmath2085  km  s@xmath14 and it remained roughly constant in velocity throughout the extent of the 7 knots .",
    "the second , slower component , was seen in only the g - j knots and it had a radial velocity of @xmath2053  km  s@xmath14 at about one - sixth of the intensity of the fast component .",
    "heathcote & reipurth ( 1992 ) showed from their longslit observations that the fast component had a roughly constant velocity of @xmath20100  km  s@xmath14 ( referenced to the + 27  km  s@xmath14 velocity of the nebular material ) , and that the brightness of the slow velocity component nearly equaled the fast velocity component in the g knot of the hh 34 jet .",
    "davis et al . (",
    "2003 ) found that the [ fe  ii ] profiles also exhibited a double - peaked profile shape and were qualitatively similar to the profiles seen in [ s  ii ] .",
    "our observations were of comparable spectral resolution to these optical studies , and we find that the h@xmath0 feature has a two component profile in many of the knots . yet , we find no evidence for a double - peaked profile shape in either the [ s  ii ] 6716 or [ s  ii ] 6731 emission features in the hh 34 jet . while high spatial resolution images have revealed time variability in the morphology and luminosity of the knots ( reipurth et al .",
    "2002 ) , the accumulated spectral data may now show evidence for temporal variations in the radial velocity kinematics of [ s  ii ] emission in the hh  34 jet .",
    "variability of emission line profiles has also been seen in the hh  2 outflow ( riera et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the observed variations in the line barycenter radial velocities of the collimated jet ( figure 6 ) are consistent with the expected velocities for knots that are formed by a succession of `` internal working surfaces '' .",
    "the true spatial velocity of the knot material , obtained by deprojecting the barycenter radial velocities , are 10 - 20  km  s@xmath14 larger than the velocities of the inter - knot regions .",
    "this is in surprisingly good agreement with the models of raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) .",
    "their study used analytic internal working surface calculations with the proper motions and spacings of the knots of the hh  34 jet to deduce an expected velocity variability with a half - amplitude of @xmath38  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the fact that the barycenter velocity decreases outwards from the jet axis to the limb of the jet ( see figure 6 ) is also expected from models in which the edges of the jet beam have protruding bow shock wings . in this scenario ,",
    "the extended wings push the surrounding material to velocities of only a fraction of the jet velocity .",
    "the behavior of the velocity dispersion as a function of position along the jet axis ( see figure 7 ) , with minima just ahead of each of the knots and maxima trailing the flux intensity peaks of the successive knots , is qualitatively consistent with the predictions from bow shock models ( raga & bhm 1986 ) .",
    "however , the axis - to - limb increase observed for the velocity dispersion of the [ s  ii ] and h@xmath0 lines ( figure 7 ) is in principle not compatible with models where the emission comes from bow shocks .",
    "such models invoke a single , curved shock with the maximum velocity dispersion at the position of the jet axis ( e.  g. , hartigan , raymond & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "the fact that we observe a lower on - axis velocity dispersion could be interpreted as evidence for an increasingly chaotic motion away from the jet axis .",
    "recent high spatial and spectral resolution studies of the emission structure in the inner collimated jets from dg tau and rw aur ( bacciotti et al .",
    "2002 ; coffey et al . 2004 ; woitas et al . 2005 ) have found evidence for asymmetry in the velocities perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "these velocity shifts are interpreted as evidence for rotation in the jets . from our observations of hh  34",
    ", we find no evidence for shifts in the velocity in the cross - jet direction .",
    "we concede that rotation of the hh  34 outflow could exist below the spectral sensitivity of our observations . however , for the large distances from the exciting source for the hh  34 collimated jet ( thousands of au ) , it is more likely that any signature of rotation has long been lost in the turbulent velocity structure inherent to the jet .",
    "variations in the electron density structure over the e through j knots in the hh  34 complex were first studied by bhrke , mundt & ray ( 1988 ) .",
    "their observations , and the longslit spectra presented by heathcote & reipurth ( 1992 ) , showed that the electron density varies by nearly a factor of 2 over these knots . yet",
    ", the data presented in these longslit spectroscopic studies did not have the spatial resolution necessary to derive electron density structure within each of the knots themselves .",
    "the [ s  ii ]  6716/6731 line ratios along the hh  34 jet axis that we present show that peaks in the electron density appear in the leading regions of each of the observed knots , and troughs in the density follow each knot .",
    "for the i knot , the variation in electron density from the up to down - flow regions is greater than a factor of five , and the peak density region shows a bow - shaped morphology ( figure 8) .",
    "knots f and g have electron density peaks that are offset from the central axis of the jet , indicating substantial deviations from axisymmetry in this region of the flow ( i.e. reipurth et al .",
    "these knots both show density maxima that are spatially offset toward alternating sides of the jet axis and the offsets seem to be roughly consistent with knot positions in the high spatial resolution [ s  ii ] images of reipurth et al .",
    "comparison with the hst images of hh  34 of reipurth et al .",

    "the [ s  ii ] 6716/6731 line ratio increases and therefore , the electron density decreases , with increasing distance from the outflow source . in the region sampled by our ifu spectroscopy of the exciting source ,",
    "the electron density has a value of @xmath3 1200  cm  @xmath49 at the position of knot a1 , but it decreases to 500 - 600  cm  @xmath49 to the left of this knot .",

    "the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratio has a value of 1.0 at knot a6 .",
    "this is not surprising because although the peak flux of the [ s  ii ] emission is greater at the position of the exciting source , the total h@xmath0 emission is comparable because the emission feature is very broad .",
    "moving down the axis of the jet in the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 map ( away from the source ) , we see a rapid increase of this line ratio as the contribution from the central h@xmath0 flux decreases .",
    "the ratio reaches a value of 4.6 at knot a1 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission from knots a3 to a1 is considerably less than that for [ s  ii ] , but it is detected at a weak level of significance .",
    "we do find evidence for a change in the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 line ratio in the cross - jet direction ( at the position of knots a1 and a2 ) .",
    "away from the central source , the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 line ratio consistently shows a decrease outwards from the jet axis .",
    "figure 18 shows the electron density channel maps obtained from the [ s ii ] 6716/6731 line ratio velocity maps .",

    "comparison of the different channel maps shown in figure 18 shows consistently the increase of the electron density with heliocentric radial velocities increasing from @xmath20134 to @xmath2074  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the electron density then decreases at all positions for less blueshifted radial velocities .",
    "the `` a knot '' of the hh  34 jet was first identified and named in the studies of reipurth et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and cohen & jones ( 1987 ) .",
    "it was found by ray et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to be comprised of a conglomeration of several smaller knots when viewed at high spatial resolution .",

    "( 2000 ) and rodrguez & reipurth ( 1996 ) showed that the infrared and radio positions of the exciting source are actually not coincident with the a6 knot detected in the optical .",
    "the exciting source is known to be highly obscured , the optical emission at knot a6 likely arises from either scattered light off the wall of the inner outflow cavity or emission from the inner - most knot of the outflow .",
    "hence , in our observations we do not actually see the star , which is revealed only at longer wavelengths .",
    "figures 3 and 14 show that the velocity structure near the exciting source position has a very strong , broad h@xmath0 emission component that is roughly symmetric in velocity and not present in [ s  ii ] .",
    "such emission features have been seen in many embedded young stars and arise from the magnetospheric accretion emission of material onto the central star .",
    "the isosurface map presented in figure 14 shows three distinct velocity components in the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the broad emission component is seen at the source position and extends from @xmath40110 to + 160 km / s .",
    "the emission that is spatially extended and centered at a velocity of @xmath310 km / s is imperfectly subtracted , residual h@xmath0 arising from the ambient nebulosity in the environment of the hh 34 jet .",
    "the third emission component evident in the h@xmath0 isosurface plot arises from the blueshifted jet itself ; it extends left - ward from the central source in figure 14 at velocity of @xmath40100 km / s .",
    "the blueshifted jet of hh 34 was also studied by takami et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and was shown to best support disk - wind models for the outflow .",
    "the three - component velocity structure can not be easily discerned in the velocity barycenter or dispersion plots ( figures 13 and 15 ) .    unlike for the collimated jet , [ s  ii ] 6716/6731 line ratios and corresponding electron density maps in the inner a knot region of the hh 34 outflow do not show a `` striped '' structure .",
    "the minimum n@xmath35 seen in this region is @xmath3500 - 600@xmath36 to the left of the a1 knot , and the electron density increases to @xmath3710@xmath52@xmath36 toward the inner outflow region of the hh  34 jet .",
    "the a4 to a6 knots are within less than @xmath32@xmath9 from the central star ( @xmath53900 au at the distance of hh 34 ) .",
    "the ambient high energy flux and density of parent cloud material are both probably greater near the exciting source .",
    "thus , the ionization fraction and the gas density are likely greater .",
    "the resulting higher n@xmath35 values probably cause the loss of the `` striped '' structure from fluctuations seen in the collimated jet .",
    "moreover , the electron density has a peak value that is spatially offset from the position of the embedded source ; the peak is coincident with the area between the a4 and a5 knots ( figure 17 ) .",
    "x - ray emission from fast shocks , recently identified in the hh  154 and hh  2 outflows , could give rise to high energy ionizing flux in the inner jet region of hh  34 ( pravdo et al .",
