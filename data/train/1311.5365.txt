    "in recent years , the atomic force microscope ( afm ) has become an indispensable tool for the indentation based characterization @xcite of mechanical properties of living samples at the nanometric scale @xcite . based on the best - fitting analysis of the force - indentation ( fi ) curve , the so - called indentation stiffness tomography technique was proposed by @xcite for distinguishing structures of different stiffness buried into the bulk of the sample .",
    "the developed methodology assumes that the presence of an inhomogeneity ( inclusion ) changes the fi curve in a deterministic way reflecting the relative hardness / softness property of the inclusion and the depth of the inclusion .",
    "the validity of this concept was verified by finite element models and was proven useful in afm - based indentation experiments on living cells @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional contact problems for the special case of an elastic half - space with inhomogeneities were studied by numerical techniques in a number of publications @xcite .",
    "an extensive review of works on the elastic problems for inclusions in an elastic half - space was very recently presented by @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the frictionless unilateral contact problem for a homogeneous linearly elastic body with a small homogeneous inclusion ( with no eigenstrains ) .",
    "based on the obtained first - order asymptotic solution , we address the identification problem resulting in the identification of some parameters of the small inhomogeneity . the dynamic problem of stress - wave identification of material defects ( e.g. , cavities , cracks , inclusions ) has been the subject of extensive research @xcite . at the same time , the quasi static problem of indentation stiffness tomography has its own peculiarities , and the asymptotic model proposed herein for the extracting the inhomogeneity parameters based on the grid indentation data has not been developed elsewhere .",
    "the objective of this study was to develop a simple mathematical model for the indentation stiffness tomography .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ 1issection2 ]",
    ", we formulate the mathematical model of frictionless indentation . by means of the method of matched asymptotic expansions , in section  [ 1issection3 ]",
    "an approximate analytical solution is obtained .",
    "the first - order asymptotic model for the indentation test is developed in [ 1issection4 ] .",
    "the case of a small spherical inhomogeneity in an elastic half - space is studied in detail in section  [ 1issection5 ] , where a procedure for extracting the inhomogeneity parameters is proposed .",
    "finally , in sections  [ 1issectiond ] and [ 1issectionc ] , respectively , we outline a discussion of the results obtained and formulate our conclusions .",
    "suppose a homogeneous linearly elastic body without inhomogeneity occupies a three - dimensional domain @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a small inhomogeneity with the center at a point @xmath2 and the diameter proportional to a small positive parameter @xmath3 such that @xmath1 lies within the domain @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the domain @xmath4 will represent the reference configuration of the homogeneous deformable body with the inhomogeneity @xmath1 .    in the absence of volume forces , the displacement vectors @xmath5 in @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath1",
    "satisfy the lam differential systems @xmath8",
    "we assume that the inhomogeneity @xmath1 is perfectly bonded to the surrounding medium , and the continuity and equilibrium conditions along the interface @xmath10 are formulated as follows : @xmath11    the outer surface of the body @xmath6 is assumed to be decomposed into three mutually disjoint parts : @xmath12 . over @xmath13 ,",
    "the body is held fixed , while the surface @xmath14 is assumed to be traction free , i.e. , @xmath15    finally , @xmath16 is the potential contact boundary , over which contact of the deformable body @xmath6 with a rigid indenter may take place .",
    "let us introduce a cartesian coordinate system with the center at a point @xmath17 on @xmath16 , which is supposed to be the initial point of contact in the case of a convex indenter ( in the unloading state , the indenter touches the surface @xmath16 at the point @xmath17 ) . to fix our ideas",
    ", we will assume that the @xmath18-axis is directed inside the body @xmath6 with the plane @xmath19 being tangent to the surface @xmath16 ( see fig.[fig1is1 ] ) .",
    "at the initial moment , the surface of the indenter is specified by the equation @xmath20 and during the normal indentation of the indenter into the deformable body ( see fig.[fig1is2 ] ) , the indenter surface will be given by the equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a small displacement of the indenter .",
    "to formulate the boundary conditions on @xmath16 , following , we denote by @xmath23 the variable gap between the indenter surface and @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the outer unit normal vector , @xmath26 is the initial gap between the body and the indenter .",
    "thus , the signorini boundary conditions of frictionless contact may be stated as @xmath27 @xmath28 here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the normal and tangential components of the stress vector @xmath31 .    under the assumption that the size of the contact area is small compared to the curvature radii of the surface @xmath16 at the point @xmath17 , we will have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the indenter shape function introduced by eq .  ( [ 1is(2.5 ) ] ) .",
    "local equilibrium at the contact interface in the @xmath18-direction requires that the contact pressure should be balanced by the contact force , @xmath34 , that is @xmath35    now , combining ( [ 1is(2.1)])([1is(2.9 ) ] ) , we formulate a mathematical model of unilateral contact for the linearly elastic body @xmath6 with the small inhomogeneity @xmath1 .",
    "at a distance from the contact zone as well as from the inhomogeneity , the stress - strain state of the body @xmath6 is approximated by the following so - called `` outer '' displacement vector - field ( see fig.[fig1is3 ] ) : @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the solution of the elastic problem in the domain @xmath0 of the action of a unit point force applied at the point @xmath17 in the @xmath18-direction , @xmath38 are the solutions of the elastic problem in the domain @xmath0 of the action of force dipoles at the point @xmath2 .        for the simplicity sake let us assume that the principal curvatures of the surface @xmath16 at the point @xmath17 are zero .",
    "then , the vector - function @xmath39 satisfies the following equations : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the solution of the boussinesq problem ( see , e.g. , ) of the action on the boundary of an elastic half - space @xmath44 of a unit force directed along the @xmath18-axis , i.e. , @xmath45    to describe the vector - functions @xmath46 , following @xcite , we introduce vector polynomials @xmath47    let also @xmath48 be the kelvin  somigliana fundamental matrix , i.e. , @xmath49    then , the vector - functions @xmath38 with singularities of order @xmath50 at the point @xmath2 are defined as follows : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    further , to construct the boundary layer around the inhomogeneity @xmath1 let us assume that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a fixed domain , from which the small inhomogeneity @xmath1 is rescaled by means of the so - called stretched coordinates @xmath56 .    in",
    "what follows , we make use of the taylor expansion @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the vector polynomials ( [ 1is(3.3 ) ] ) , and the strain components @xmath60 are defined as @xmath61    thus , in view of ( [ 1is(3.1 ) ] ) , @xmath62 , and ( [ 1is(3.5 ) ] ) , the following asymptotic expansion takes place : @xmath63    by the method of matched asymptotic expansions @xcite , the stress - strain state of the body @xmath6 in the vicinity of the inhomogeneity is approximated by the vector - function @xmath64 here , @xmath65 are the unique solutions of the following elastic problem @xcite : @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69    the solutions of the above problem have the following expansions at the infinity @xcite : @xmath70 here , @xmath71 are the components of the so - called elasticity polarization matrix of the inhomogeneity @xmath55 @xcite .    thus , in view of ( [ 1is(3.6 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(3.8 ) ] ) , the asymptotic matching of the outer asymptotic representation ( [ 1is(3.1 ) ] ) and the inner asymptotic representation ( [ 1is(3.7 ) ] ) implies the equations @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the polarization matrix components for the inhomogeneity @xmath1 .",
    "to construct the boundary layer type solution around the indenter , we consider the following asymptotic expansion ( see ( [ 1is(3.1 ) ] ) and @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 here , @xmath76 is the regular part of green s function @xmath37 . in asymptotic analysis of frictionless contact problems ,",
    "an important role is played by the asymptotic constant @xmath77 , which can be normalized as follows @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a dimensionless quantity , which depends on poisson s ratio @xmath80 , @xmath81 is a characteristic size of the domain @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1is1 ] ) .    following @xcite",
    ", the first order asymptotic model of unilateral contact can be formulated in the form @xmath82 @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the contact pressure , @xmath85 is the contact domain , which should be determined as a part of solution of the integral equation ( [ 1is(3.12 ) ] ) under the conditions ( [ 1is(3.12a ) ] ) .",
    "let us consider the case of blunt indenter with the shape function @xmath86 note that the cases @xmath87 and @xmath88 correspond to a conical , spherical , and cylindrical indenter , respectively .    in the axisymmetric case ( [ 1is(3.13 ) ] ) , using the known analytical solution @xcite , we can get a closed - form solution to eq .  ( [ 1is(3.12 ) ] ) .",
    "in particular , the indenter displacement @xmath22 , the contact force @xmath34 , and the contact radius @xmath89 are related by the following two equations , which are exact consequences of eq .",
    "( [ 1is(3.12 ) ] ) @xcite : @xmath90 @xmath91 here we introduced the following notation ( with @xmath92 being the gamma function ) : @xmath93 @xmath94    equations ( [ 1is(3.14 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(3.15 ) ] ) imply that during the depth - sensing indentation , the incremental indentation stiffness can be evaluated according to the relation @xmath95 which represents the first - order asymptotic model for the indentation stiffness in the axisymmetric case .",
    "we emphasize that the coefficients of the asymptotic representation ( [ 1is(3.17 ) ] ) do not depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath96 , which describes the indenter shape @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ 1is(3.17 ) ] ) is not convenient from the point of view of the indentation stiffness tomography method , because the contact radius @xmath89 is not an easily controlled parameter .",
    "based on the asymptotic analysis given @xcite , the following first - order asymptotic model for the indentation stiffness can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ 1is(3.14 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(3.15 ) ] ) : @xmath97    thus , if the indentation testing is performed with the same indentation depth , denoting by @xmath98 the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1is(3.20 ) ] ) , we can rewrite it as follows : @xmath99 here , @xmath100 is the indentation stiffness of the bulk material under the specified level of indentation , i.e. , @xmath101    from ( [ 1is(3.21 ) ] ) , it immediately follows that @xmath102    eq .",
    "( [ 1is(3.22 ) ] ) assumes that near the point of indentation , the elastic body @xmath0 is approximated by an elastic half - space .",
    "this assumption is valid only for relatively small values of the contact radius .",
    "finally , using the second betti s formula @xmath103 and taking into account the relations @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 on @xmath16 near the point @xmath17 ) and @xmath106 as well as the boundary conditions in ( [ 1is(3.2 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(3.4 ) ] ) , we obtain after integration by parts that @xmath107 thus , formulas ( [ 1is(3.16 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(3.18 ) ] ) imply that @xmath108 where the strain components @xmath60 are defined in ( [ 1is(3.5a ) ] ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the polarization matrix @xmath109 for a spherical inhomogeneity @xmath1 of radius @xmath110 is related to the stiffness contribution tensor @xmath111 of the inhomogeneity by the formula @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a certain reference volume . by using a known solution @xcite",
    ", we will have @xmath114 where coefficients @xmath115 and where @xmath116 are components of the fourth rank unit tensor , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the bulk moduli of the sphere and the matrix , respectively , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the corresponding shear moduli , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the sphere volume .",
    "thus , in the case of spherical inhomogeneity , we obtain @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the inclusion  matrix elastic moduli ratio , @xmath125",
    "@xmath126 @xmath127    note that in the cases of spherical cavity and rigid sphere we , correspondingly , have @xmath128 @xmath129    now , let us introduce a coordinate system in such a way that the center of the sphere @xmath1 has the coordinates @xmath130 . to fix our ideas",
    ", we consider the indentation testing of the elastic half - space with the inclusion by moving the indentation point along the @xmath131-axis ( see fig.[fig1is4 ] ) .",
    "thus , the strain components in the boussinesq problem can be represented as @xmath132 where @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135    because the elastic body @xmath0 coincides with an elastic half - space , formula ( [ 1is(3.19 ) ] ) reduces to the following one : @xmath136 now , taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ 1is(4.1 ) ] ) , ( [ 1is(4.2 ) ] ) , and ( [ 1is(4.7 ) ] ) , we obtain @xmath137 where the expression in the braces in ( [ 1is(4.9 ) ] ) depends on the relative distance from the indentation point to the epicenter of the spherical inhomogeneity , @xmath138 , the relative stiffness of the inhomogeneity , @xmath139 , and poisson s ratios , @xmath80 and @xmath140 .",
    "because a value of @xmath141 is usually assumed for poisson s ratio of cells , let us consider a special case of incompressible bulk material when @xmath142 . then , according to eqs .",
    "( [ 1is(4.8 ) ] ) , we will have @xmath143 now , substituting the expressions ( [ 1is(4.3 ) ] ) , ( [ 1is(4.4 ) ] ) , and ( [ 1is(4.11 ) ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 1is(4.10 ) ] ) and passing to the limit as @xmath144 in the obtained result , we arrive at the formula @xmath145    on the other hand , formula ( [ 1is(3.23 ) ] ) can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath98 and @xmath100 are the incremental indentation stiffnesses of the elastic half - space with the inclusion and without the inclusion under the same level of indentation .    because the epicenter of the inclusion @xmath1 is not known a priori , the so - called grid indentation technique @xcite should be employed to collect the indentation stiffness data @xmath147 at points @xmath148 , @xmath149 .    according to the relations ( [ 1is(4.12 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(4.13 ) ] ) , the experimental data should be fitted with the following five - parameter approximation : @xmath150 here , @xmath151 is the ( unknown ) depth of the inclusion , @xmath152 are the coordinates of its epicenter , @xmath100 is the indentation stiffness of the bulk material , and @xmath153 is some coefficient , which reflects the presence of the inclusion .    the inclusion parameter identification can be performed as follows .",
    "first , by the least square method , the five unknowns on the right - hand side of ( [ 1is(4.14 ) ] ) are determined from the solution of the optimization problem @xmath154    second , in view of ( [ 1is(4.12)])([1is(4.14 ) ] ) , the following relationship should hold true : @xmath155    since the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1is(4.15 ) ] ) is supposed to be already known , we have only one equation for determining the three parameters @xmath139 , @xmath156 , and @xmath140 . as usual in the indentation - identification testing , we can assume some value for poisson s ratio of the inclusion , @xmath140 .",
    "after that , eq .  ( [ 1is(4.15 ) ] ) allows to determine either of the two parameters @xmath139 and @xmath156 provided the other is known .",
    "first of all , observe that the elastic polarization matrix @xmath157 is positive ( negative ) definite for relatively hard ( soft ) inclusions @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the quadratic form @xmath158 will be sign definite .",
    "this implies that a hard inclusion produces a steeper force - displacement curve than a softer one .",
    "it should be also emphasized that though this conclusion is drawn from an asymptotic model , it has a general character @xcite .",
    "second , the proposed identification method assumes the knowledge of both poisson s ratios @xmath140 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that even in the extreme cases ( cavity ( [ 1is(4.5 ) ] ) or rigid inclusion ( [ 1is(4.6 ) ] ) ) , poisson s ratio @xmath80 is required to extract the bulk elastic modulus @xmath159 from the bulk indentation stiffness @xmath100 .",
    "third , the error of determining the elastic moduli ratio @xmath124 from eq .",
    "( [ 1is(4.15 ) ] ) increases when the inclusion becomes stiffer ( @xmath160 increases relative to @xmath159 ) . in this case , the rigid inclusion model based on eqs .",
    "( [ 1is(4.6 ) ] ) and ( [ 1is(4.10 ) ] ) should be employed to verify the obtained results .    finally , it is to note that the same identification procedure can be used in the case of a small inhomogeneity buried in an elastic layer provided eqs .",
    "( [ 1is(4.8 ) ] ) are replaced with the corresponding equations for the strains in the elastic layer without any inhomogeneity at the point coinciding with the small inhomogeneity center .",
    "in this study , the problem of indentation stiffness tomography for sensing of a small inhomogeneity in a homogeneous reference elastic body is investigated via an asymptotic modeling approach . with the reference body modeled as a homogeneous elastic half - space , the inverse problem of the spherical inhomogeneity parameter identification",
    "is reduced to the least - square based minimization of a misfit between the asymptotic predictions for the indentation stiffness and the massive array of experimental data for the indentation stiffness under a specified level of indentation depth collected on the body surface by means of grid indentation technique .",
