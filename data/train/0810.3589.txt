    "in the analysis of high - energy scattering processes , leading twist effects are often both easier to isolate ( e.g. by increasing @xmath3 until higher twist effects are negligible ) and have a more direct physical interpretation than contributions from higher twist operators which are often intermingled with @xmath4 corrections to leading twist operators .",
    "a notable exception is is the twist-3 polarized structure function @xmath5 , which can be cleanly separated from its twist-2 counterpart @xmath6 when scattering longitudinally polarized leptons from a transversely polarized target . while in general ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath7 to the polarized cross section is suppressed by powers of @xmath8 , at a target polarization angle of @xmath9 the leading contribution vanishes and the contribution from @xmath10 is exposed without kinematical suppression .",
    "this property of the polarized dis cross section thus allows a clean extraction of higher twist matrix elements , without the need for fitting and subtracting a leading twist effect , and thus makes polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) a rare opportunity for studying higher twist effects ( for an overview , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath5 involves higher twist , it does not have a parton interpretation as a single particle density .",
    "indeed , the twist-3 part of @xmath7 is related to quark - gluon correlations whose intuitive interpretation may not be immediately clear .",
    "since @xmath5 is related to ( electromagnetic ) polarizabilities at low @xmath3 , these twist-3 matrix elements have been called color polarizabilities in the literature @xcite . however , at high @xmath3 , the twist-3 piece of @xmath5 is described by a local correlator and the physical interpretation as a polarizability no longer applies . indeed , while nucleons need to be polarized in order to study @xmath5 , the nucleons are not distorted , but only ` spin - alligned ' .",
    "the quark - gluon correlations embodied in the twist-3 part of @xmath5 are then obtained as a matrix elements of a certain operator in a spin - alligned , but undeformed , nucleon .",
    "this is very different from the usual use of the term ` polarizability ' as the tendency of a charge or magnetization distribution to be distorted from its normal shape by an external field .",
    "of course , one could broaden the notion of ` polarizability ' to encompass matrix elements that are only non - zero when the nucleon is polarized , but within such a broadened definition , other spin - dependent observables , such as the polarized parton distribution @xmath11 or even the magnetic moment of the nucleon , would then also become ` polarizabilities ' in the broader sense .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore an alternative physical interpretation of these particular twist-3 matrix elements as a _",
    "force_. first we summarize the connection between the @xmath0 moment of @xmath5 and quark - gluon correlations . after discussing the connection between these correlations and the transverse force on the active quark in dis",
    ", we then estimate sign and magnitude of that force based on dis data , lattice calculations and heuristic pictures .",

    "note that conventions exist where @xmath21 appears on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : d2 ] ) in which case",
    "there is no factor @xmath22 on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : twist3 ] ) .    in the limit where @xmath3 is so low that the virtual photon wavelength is larger than the nucleon size ,",
    "the electro - magnetic field associated with the two virtual photons appearing in the forward compton amplitude corresponding to the structure function is nearly homogenous accross the nucleon and the spin - dependent structure function @xmath5 can be related to spin - dependent polarizabilities . in contradistinction , in the bjorken limit , the matrix elements describing the moments of @xmath5 are given by local correlation functions , such as ( [ eq : twist3 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , because of the abovementioned low @xmath3 interpretation of @xmath7 , the _ local _ matrix elements appearing in ( [ eq : twist3 ] ) _ e 2m^2 s = p , s| q^ g e q | p , s_b 2m^2 s = p , s| q^g b q | p , s , [ eq : chi ] where d_2 = ( _ e-2_m ) , [ eq : d2chi ] ( note that @xmath23 ) are sometimes called color electric and magnetic polarizabilities @xcite . in the following",
    "we will discuss why , at high @xmath3 , a better interpretation for these matrix elements is that of a ` force ' .    in electro - magnetism ,",
    "the @xmath24-component of the lorentz force @xmath25 acting on a particle with charge @xmath26 moving , with ( nearly ) the speed of light along the @xmath27 direction , @xmath28 , reads f^y = e^y = e ( e^y - b^x ) = -ef^+y , which involves the same linear combination of lorentz components that also appears in the gluon field strength tensor in ( [ eq : twist3 ] ) .",
    "this simple observation already suggests a connection between @xmath29 and the color lorentz force on a quark that moves ( in a dis experiment ) with @xmath28 .    in order to explore this connection",
    "further we compare the matrix element defining @xmath29 with that describing the average transverse momentum of quarks in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) @xcite .",
    "the average intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks bound in a nucleon vanishes and therefore any net transverse momentum of quarks in a sidis experiment must come from the final state interactions ( fsi ) @xcite .",
    "the average transverse momentum of the ejected quark ( also averaged over the momentum fraction @xmath30 carried by the active quark in order to render the matrix element local in the position of the quark field operator ) in a sidis experiment can thus be represented by the matrix element @xcite k_^y= - p , s ||q(0)_0^dx^-gg^+y(x^+=0,x^- ) ^+q(0 )    implicitly understood , but not written out explicitly .",
    "one way to derive this expression is to start from gauge invariantly defined quark momentum distributions with wilson line gauge links extending to ligh - cone infinity .",
    "the integral over the gauge field is then obtained by acting with the transverse derivative ( when averaging over @xmath31 ) on the gauge field appearing in the wilson line @xcite .",
    "the matrix element appearing in ( [ eq : qs ] ) thus has a simple physical interpretation as the transverse impulse obtained by intergrating the color lorentz force along the trajectory of the active quark  which is an almost light - like trajectory along the @xmath27 direction , with @xmath32 .",
    "in order to make the correspondence more explicit , we now rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : qs ] ) as an integral over time k_^y= - p , s ||q(0)_0^dt g^+y(t , z =- t ) ^+q(0 ) |p , s[eq : qs2 ] in which the physical interpretation of @xmath33 as being the ( ensemble averaged ) transverse force acting on the struck quark at time @xmath34 after being struck by the virtual photon becomes more apparent .",

    "although the identification of @xmath37 as a color lorentz force may be intuitively evident after the above discussion , it is also instructive to provide a more formal justification . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the time dependence of the transverse momentum of the ` good ' component of the quark fields ( the component relevant for dis in the bjorken limit ) @xmath38 2p^+ ^y & & ps| |q ^+ ( p^y - ga^y ) q | ps = ps| q_+^(p^y - ga^y ) q_+ | ps [ eq : eom1 ] + & = & 2p^+ ps| | ps .using the qcd equations of motion = ( iga^0 + ^0 ) q , [ eq : eom2 ] where @xmath39 , yields 2p^+^y & = & ps| |q^+ g(g^y0+g^yz ) q | ps + ` ps| |q ^+ ^- ^i d^i d^j q | ps ' [ eq : eom3 ] + & = & ps| |q^+ gg^y+ q | ps + ` ps| |q ^+ ^- ^i d^i d^j q | ps ' , [ eq : eom4 ] where @xmath40 stands symbolically for all terms that involve a product of @xmath41 as well as a @xmath42 and that also involve only transverse derivatives @xmath43 .",
    "now it is important to keep in mind that we are not interested in the average force on the ` original ' quark fields ( before the quark is struck by the virtual photon ) , but _",
    "after _ absorbing the virtual photon and moving with ( nearly ) the speed of light in the @xmath27 direction . in this limit , the first term on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : eom4 ] ) dominates , as it contains the largest number of ` @xmath17 ' lorentz indices .",
    "dropping the other terms yields ( [ eq : qs3 ] ) .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath0-moment @xmath44 of the twist-4 distribution @xmath45 allows determination of the expectation value of a different linear combination of lorentz / dirac components of the quark - gluon correlator appearing in ( [ eq : twist3 ] ) @xcite f_2 m^2s^= p , s| |qg^_q|p , s . using rotational invariance , to relate various lorentz components",
    "one thus finds a linear combination of the matrix elements of electric and magnetic quark - gluon correlators ( [ eq : chi ] ) f_2=_e-_m , that differs from that in ( [ eq : d2chi ] ) . in combination with ( [ eq : twist3 ] )",
    "this allows a decomposition of the force into electric and magnetic components @xmath46 , using f_e^y(0)= - _ ef_b^y(0)= - _ b for a target nucleon polarized in the @xmath47 direction , where @xcite _ e = ( 2d_2+f_2 ) _ m = ( 4d_2-f_2 ) .    a relation similar to ( [ eq : qs3 ] )",

    "( [ eq : odd1 ] ) shows that the average transverse force at @xmath53 ( right after being struck ) on a quark polarized in the @xmath47 direction reads f^y(0 ) = gp| |q ^+yg^+yq| p= mp^+s^x e_2 = e_2 , [ eq : fe2 ] where the last identify holds only in the rest frame of the target nucleon and for @xmath36 . in the physical interpretation of ( [ eq : fe2 ] )",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , for a given flavor , the number of quarks on which the force in ( [ eq : fe2 ] ) is only half that in ( [ eq : qs3 ] ) as only half the quarks in an unpolarized nucleon will be polarized in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "when the target nucleon is transversely polarized , e.g. in the @xmath47 direction the axial symmetry in the transverse plane is broken .",
    "in particular , the quark distribution ( more precisely the distribution of the @xmath54-density that dominates in dis in the bjorken limit ) in the transverse plane is deformed @xcite . the average deformations can be related to the contribution from each quark flavor to the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon and was predicted to be quite substantial @xcite and has also been observed in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "1.cm    ( 10,5)(2.7,12.7 )    given the fact that , for a nucleon polarized in the @xmath47 direction the @xmath54-distribution for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is shifted towards the @xmath57 direction suggests that these quarks also ` feel ' a nonzero color - electric force pointing on average in the @xmath58 direction , i.e. one would expect that @xmath29 is positive ( negative ) for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) quarks .",
    "this is also consistent with a negative ( positive ) sign for the sivers on the proton function as observed by the hermes collaboration @xcite and the vanishing sivers function for deuterium in the compass experiment @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the large @xmath59 limit , one would expect that @xmath29 for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) quarks are equal and opposite .",
    "note that while @xmath29 for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) quarks being exactly equal and opposite would imply the same for protons ( neutrons ) , any deviation from being exactly equal and opposite is enhanced for proton ( neutron ) since there is a significant cancellation between the two quark flavors in the nucleon .",
    "if all spectators in the fsi were to ` pull ' in the same direction , the force on the active quark would be of the order of the qcd string tension @xmath60 , which would translate into a value @xmath61 .",
    "however , it is more natural to expect a significant cancellation between forces from spectators pulling the active quark in different directions , the actual value of @xmath29 is probably about one order of magnitude smaller , i.e. @xmath62 appears to be more natural .",
    "instanton based models have suggested an even smaller value @xcite .",
    "heuristic arguments / lattice calculations @xcite also suggest that the deformation of ( the @xmath54-distribution for ) transversely polarized quarks in an unpolarized nucleon is more significant than that of unpolarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "when applied to the final state interactions , this observation suggests @xmath63 ( the fact that in an unpolarized nucleon only half the quarks are polarized in the @xmath47-direction is compensated by the factor @xmath64 in ( [ eq : fe2 ] ) .",
    "lattice calculations of the twist-3 matrix element yield @xcite d_2^(u ) = 0.020 0.024 d_2^(d ) = -0.011 0.010 renormalized at a scale of @xmath65 gev@xmath66 for the smallest lattice spacing in ref .",
    "note that we have multiplied the numerical results from @xcite by a factor of @xmath22 to account for the different convention for @xmath29 being used .    here",
    "the identity @xmath67gev / fm is useful to better visualize the magnitude of the force .",
    "f_(u ) = -25 30 mev / fmf_(d ) = 14 13 mev / fm . in the chromodynamic lensing picture",
    ", one would have expected that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are of about the same magnitude and with opposite sign .",
    "the same holds in the large @xmath59 limit . a vanishing sivers effect for an isoscalar target would be more consistent with equal and opposite average forces .",
    "however , since the error bars for @xmath29 include only statistical errors , the lattice result may not be inconsistent with @xmath70 .",
    "the average transverse momentum from the sivers effect is obtained by integrating the transverse force to infinity ( along a light - like trajectory ) @xmath71 ( [ eq : qs2 ] ) .",
    "this motivates us to define an ` effective range ' r_eff .",
    "note that @xmath72 depends on how rapidly the correlations fall off along a light - like direction and it may thus be larger than the ( spacelike ) radius of a hadron . of cource , unless the functional form of the integrand is known , @xmath72 can not really tell us about the range of the fsi , but if the integrand does not oscillate    fits of the sivers function to sidis data yield @xcite one finds about @xmath73 mev @xcite .",
    "together with the ( average ) value for @xmath74 from the littice this translates into an effective range @xmath72 of several fm .",
    "it would be interesting to compare @xmath72 for different quark flavors and as a function of @xmath3 , but this requires more precise values for @xmath29 as well as the sivers function .",
    "note that a complementary approach to the effective range was chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the twist-3 matrix element appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qs3 ] ) was , due to the lack of lattice qcd results , estimated using qcd sum rule techniques .",
    "moreover , the ` range ' was taken as a model _ input _ parameter to estimate the magnitude of the sivers function .",
    "the impact parameter distribution for quarks polarized in the @xmath47 direction was found to be shifted in the @xmath50 direction @xcite . applying the chromodynamic lensing model implies a force in the negative @xmath75 direction for these quarks and one thus expects @xmath76 for both @xmath55 and @xmath56 quarks .",
    "magnitude : since @xmath77 , expect odd force larger than even force and thus @xmath78 .",
    "it would be interesting to study not only whether the effective range is flavor dependent , but also whether there is a difference between the chirally even and odd cases .",
