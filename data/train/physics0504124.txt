    "there is a growing consensus among social scientists that many social phenomena display an inherent network dimension .",
    "not only are they embedded  in the underlying social network @xcite but , reciprocally , the social network itself is largely shaped by the evolution of those phenomena .",
    "the range of social problems subject to these considerations is wide and important .",
    "it includes , for example , the spread of crime @xcite and other social problems ( e.g. teenage pregnancy @xcite ) , the rise of industrial districts @xcite , and the establishment of research collaborations , both scientific @xcite and industrial @xcite . throughout these cases ,",
    "there are a number of interesting observations worth highlighting :    \\(a ) * sharp transitions * : _  the shift from a sparse to a highly connected network often unfolds rather abruptly ,  i.e. in a short timespan_. for example , concerning the escalation of social pathologies in some neighborhoods of large cities , crane @xcite writes that ... if the incidence [ of the problem ] reaches a critical point , the process of spread will explode .  also , considering the growth of research collaboration networks , goyal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report a steep increase in the per capita number of collaborations among academic economists in the last three decades , while hagerdoorn @xcite reports an even sharper ( ten - fold ) increase for r&d partnerships among firms during the decade 1975 - 1985 .",
    "( b ) *  resilience * : _  once the transition to a highly connected network has taken place , the network is robust , surviving even a reversion to unfavorable  conditions_. the case of california s silicon valley , discussed in a classic account by saxenian @xcite , illustrates this point well .",
    "its thriving performance , even in the face of the general crisis undergone by the computer industry in the 80 s , has been largely attributed to the dense and flexible networks of collaboration across individual actors that characterized it .",
    "another intrinsically network - based example is the rapid recent development of open - source software ( e.g. linux ) , a phenomenon sustained against large odds by a dense web of collaboration and trust @xcite .",
    "finally , as an example where robustness  has negative rather than positive implications ,  crane @xcite describes the difficulty , even with vigorous social measures , of improving a local neighborhood once crime and other social pathologies have taken hold .",
    "\\(c ) * equilibrium co - existence * : _ under apparently similar environmental conditions , social networks may be found both in a dense or sparse state_. again , a good illustration is provided by the dual experience of poor neighborhoods in large cities @xcite , where neither poverty nor other socio - economic conditions ( e.g. ethnic composition ) can alone explain whether or not there is degradation into a ghetto with rampant social problems . returning to r&d partnerships ,",
    "empirical evidence @xcite shows a very polarized situation , almost all r&d partnerships taking place in a few ( high - technology ) industries . even within those industries",
    ", partnerships are almost exclusively between a small subset of firms in ( highly advanced ) countries .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the above discussion raises the question of whether there is some common mechanism at work in the dynamics of social networks that , in a wide variety of different scenarios , produces the three features explained above : ( a ) discontinuous phase transitions , ( b ) resilience , and ( c ) equilibrium coexistence .",
    "our aim in this paper is to shed light on this question within a general framework that is flexible enough to accommodate , under alternative concrete specifications , a rich range of social - network dynamics .",
    "the recent literature on complex networks has largely focused on understanding what are the generic properties arising in networks under different link formation mechanisms .",
    "those properties are important to gain a proper theoretical grasp of many network phenomena and also provide useful guiding principles for empirical research .",
    "the analysis , however , has been mostly static , largely concerned with features such as small - world @xcite or scale - free @xcite networks . in contrast",
    ", our approach in this paper to the issue of network formation is intrinsically dynamic , the steady state being a balance of link formation and removal .",
    "we consider a set of agents  be they individuals or organizations  who establish bilateral interactions ( links ) when profitable .",
    "the network evolves under changing conditions .",
    "that is , the favorable circumstances that led at some point to the formation of a particular link may later on deteriorate , causing that link s removal . hence volatility ( exogenous or endogenous ) is a key disruptive element in the dynamics .",
    "concurrently , new opportunities arise that favour the formation of new links .",
    "whether linking occurs depends on factors related to the similarity or proximity of the two parties .",
    "for example , in cases where trust is essential in the establishment of new relationships ( e.g. in crime or trade networks ) , linking may be facilitated by common acquaintances or by the existence of a chain of acquaintances joining the two parties .",
    "in other cases ( e.g. in r&d or scientific networks ) , a common language , methodology , or comparable level of technical competence may be required for the link to be feasible or fruitful to both parties .    in a nutshell",
    ", our model conceives the dynamics of the network as a struggle between volatility ( that causes link decay ) on the one hand , and the creation of new links ( that is dependent on similarity ) on the other .",
    "the model must also specify the dynamics governing inter - node similarity .",
    "a reasonable assumption in this respect is that such similarity is enhanced by close interaction , as reflected by the social network .",
    "for example , a firm ( or researcher ) benefits from collaborating with a similarly advanced partner , or individuals who interact regularly tend to converge on their social norms and other standards of behavior .",
    "we study different specifications of the general framework , each one embodying alternative forms of the intuitive idea that interaction promotes similarity .",
    "our main finding is that in all of these different cases the network dynamics exhibits , over a wide range of parameters , the type of phenomenology discussed above .",
    "the essential mechanism at work is a positive feedback between link creation and internode similarity , these two factors each exerting a positive effect on the other .",
    "feedback forces of this kind appear to operate in the dynamics of many social networks .",
    "we show that they are sufficient to produce the sharp transitions , resilience , and equilibrium co - existence that , as explained , are salient features of many social phenomena .",
    "consider a set @xmath0 of agents , whose interactions evolve in continuous time @xmath1 .",
    "their network of interaction at some @xmath1 is described by a non - directed graph @xmath2 , where @xmath3 iff a link exists between agents @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the network evolves in the following manner .",
    "firstly , each node @xmath4 receives an opportunity to form a link with a node @xmath5 , randomly drawn from @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , at rate @xmath8 ( i.e. with a probability @xmath9 in a time interval @xmath10 ) .",
    "if this link @xmath11 is not already in place , it forms with probability    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the distance  ( to be specified later ) between @xmath4 and @xmath5 prevailing at @xmath14 thus if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are close , in the sense that their distance is no higher than some given threshold @xmath15 , the link forms at rate @xmath8 ; otherwise , it forms at a much smaller rate @xmath16 .",
    "secondly , each existing link @xmath17 decays at rate @xmath18 .",
    "that is , each link in the network disappears with probability @xmath19 in a time interval @xmath10 .",
    "we shall discuss three different specifications of the distance @xmath20 , each capturing different aspects that may be relevant for socio - economic interactions .",
    "consider first the simplest possible such specification where @xmath13 is the ( geodesic ) distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 on the graph @xmath21 , neighbors @xmath5 of @xmath4 having @xmath22 , neighbors of the neighbors of @xmath4 ( which are not neighbors of @xmath23 ) having @xmath24 and so on .",
    "if no path joins @xmath4 and @xmath5 we set @xmath25 .",
    "this specific model describes a situation where the formation of new links is strongly influenced by proximity on the graph .",
    "it is a simple manifestation of our general idea that close interaction brings about similarity  here the two metrics coincide .",
    "when @xmath26 , the link formation process discriminates between agents belonging to the same network component ( which are joined by at least one path of links in @xmath27 ) and agents in different components .",
    "distinct components of the graph may , for example , represent different social groups .",
    "( [ pform ] ) captures the fact that belonging to the same social group is important in the creation of new links ( say , because it facilitates control or reciprocity @xcite ) .",
    "consider first what happens when @xmath18 is large .",
    "let @xmath28 be the average connectivity ( number of links per node ) in the network .",
    "the average rate @xmath29 of link removal is very high when @xmath28 is significant .",
    "consequently , we expect to have a very low @xmath28 , which in turn implies that the population should be fragmented into many small groups . under these circumstances ,",
    "the likelihood that an agent @xmath4 meets  an agent @xmath5 in the same component is negligible for large populations , and therefore new links are created at a rate almost equal to @xmath30 . invoking a simple balance between link creation and link destruction ,",
    "the average number of neighbors of an agent is expected to be @xmath31 , as is indeed found in our simulations ( fig [ fig_giant ] ) .",
    "as @xmath32 decreases , the network density @xmath28 increases gradually , but then , at a critical value @xmath33 it makes a discontinuous jump ( fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] ) to a state containing a large and densely interconnected community covering a finite fraction of the population ( the giant component ) . naturally , if volatility @xmath32 decreases further , the network becomes even more densely connected .",
    "but , remarkably , if volatility increases back again beyond the transition point @xmath33 the dense network remains stable .",
    "the dense network dissolves back into a sparsely connected one only at a second point @xmath34 .",
    "this phenomenology characterizes a wide region of parameter space ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] ) and is qualitatively well reproduced by a simple mean field approach ( see appendix ) .     mean degree @xmath28 as a function of @xmath32 for @xmath35 when @xmath20 is the distance on the graph and @xmath26 .",
    "the results of a mean field theory for @xmath36 ( solid line ) is compared to numerical simulations ( @xmath37 ) starting from both low and high connected states with @xmath38 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to an unstable solution of the mean field equations which separates the basins of stability of the two solutions .",
    "indeed the low density state , for finite @xmath39 , flips  to the high density state when a random fluctuation in @xmath28 brings the system across the stability boundary ( i.e. when a sizable giant component forms ) .",
    "these fluctuations become more and more rare as @xmath39 increases .",
    "_ inset _ : phase diagram in mean field theory .",
    "coexistence occurs in the shaded region whereas below ( above ) only the dense ( sparse ) network phase is stable",
    ". numerical simulations ( symbols ) agree qualitatively with the mean field prediction .",
    "the high ( low ) density state is stable up ( down ) to the points marked with @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and is unstable at points marked with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath28 along the dashed line is reported in the main figure . ]",
    "a similar phenomenology occurs when @xmath44 , i.e. when links are preferentially formed with friends of friends , in an appropriate parameter range . and @xmath32 must be comparable to the probability that two arbitrary nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 have @xmath45 , which is of order @xmath46 in a network with finite degree . ]",
    "this is reminiscent of a model that was recently proposed @xcite to describe a situation where ( as e.g. in job search @xcite ) agents find new linking opportunities through current partners . in @xcite agents",
    "use their links to search for new connections , whereas here existing links favor new link formation . in spite of this conceptual difference , the model in ref .",
    "@xcite also features the phenomenology ( a)-(c ) above , i.e. sharp transitions , resilience , and phase coexistence .",
    "we now consider an alternative specialization of the general framework where link formation requires some form of coordination , synchronization , or compatibility .",
    "for example , a profitable interaction may fail to occur if the two parties do not agree on where and when to meet , or if they do not speak the same languages , and/or adopt compatible technologies and standards .",
    "in addition , it may well be that shared social norms and codes enhance trust and thus are largely needed for fruitful interaction .    to account for these considerations ,",
    "we endow each agent with an attribute @xmath47 which may take a finite number @xmath48 of different values , @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath47 describes the internal state of the agent , specifying e.g. its technological standard , language , or the social norms she adopts .",
    "the formation of a new link @xmath11 requires that @xmath4 and @xmath5 display the same attribute , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "this is a particularization of the general eq .",
    "( [ pform ] ) with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for simplicity",
    "we set @xmath53 since in the present formulation there is always a finite probability that two nodes display the same attribute and hence can link .",
    "we assume each agent revises its attribute at rate @xmath54 , choosing @xmath55 dependent on its neighbours @xmath56s according to : @xmath57    \\label{potts}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 tunes the tendency of agents to conform with their neighbors and @xmath59 provides the normalisation .",
    "this adjustment rule has a long tradition in physics @xcite and also occurs in the socio - economic literature as a model of coordination ( or social conformity ) under local interaction @xcite .",
    "this is another manifestation of our general idea that network - mediated contact favors internode similarity .",
    "we focus on the case where such a similarity - enhancing dynamics proceeds at a much faster rate than the network dynamics .",
    "that is , @xmath60 so that , at any given @xmath1 where the network @xmath21 is about to change@xmath61 the attribute dynamics on the @xmath47 have relaxed to a stationary state .",
    "the statistics of this state is provided by the potts model in physics , which has been recently discussed for random graphs @xcite .",
    "we refer to the appendix for details and move directly to discussing the results .    for a given @xmath58 , under strong volatility ( @xmath62 )",
    "the link density is very low , there is no giant component and agents @xmath4 , @xmath5 chosen at random ( for @xmath39 large ) are not coordinated ( @xmath63 ) . hence links form at a node at rate @xmath64 .",
    "a simple balance of link formation and decay rates implies that @xmath65 in this case .",
    "when @xmath32 decreases , network density @xmath28 increases .",
    "first , it does so gradually but at a critical point @xmath66 @xmath28 becomes sufficiently large that the @xmath55s within the giant component ( whose existence is necessary for coordination ) become coordinated .",
    "link formation increases since now @xmath67 and this in turn increases the coordination .",
    "this positive feedback causes a sharp transition to a coordinated , more highly connected state .",
    "once this sharp transition has taken place , further decreases in @xmath32 are simply reflected in gradual increases in network density .",
    "on the other hand , subsequent changes of @xmath68 in the opposite direction are met by hysteresis .",
    "that is , if @xmath32 now grows starting at values below @xmath33 the network does _ not _ revert to the sparse network at the latter threshold .",
    "rather , it remains in a dense state up to a larger value @xmath69 , sustained by the same positive feedback discussed above .",
    "this phenomenology , though induced by a different mechanism , is quite similar in spirit to that reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] for the previous model . in the limit @xmath70 ,",
    "the second model becomes equivalent to the first one since with @xmath70 , all nodes in the same component share the same value of @xmath71 , whilst the probability to link two disconnected nodes is @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the roles of @xmath73 and @xmath32 in the model are analogous .",
    "if we fix @xmath32 and parametrize the behavior of the model through @xmath74 the same phenomena of discontinuous transitions , hysteresis , and equilibrium co - existence occurs for corresponding threshold values @xmath75 and @xmath76 , analogous to @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the former discussion .",
    "finally , we consider a setup where @xmath20 reflects proximity of nodes @xmath4 , @xmath5 in terms of some continuous ( non - negative ) real attributes , @xmath79 , @xmath80 these attributes could represent the level of technical expertise of two firms involved in an r&d partnership , or the competence of two researchers involved in a joint project .",
    "it could also be a measure of income or wealth that bears on the quality and prospects of a bilateral relationship .",
    "whatever the interpretation , it may be natural in certain applications to posit that some process of diffusion tends to equalize the levels displayed by neighboring agents .",
    "this idea is captured by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath81 + w_{i}(t)\\eta _ { i}(t )   \\label{w}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is uncorrelated white noise , i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) describes the diffusion component of the process , which draws the levels of neighboring agents closer .",
    "this homogenizing force competes with the random idiosyncratic growth term @xmath84 .",
    "random growth processes subject to diffusion such as that of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) are well known in physics .",
    "in particular it is known @xcite that the fluctuation properties of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) when @xmath85 is larger than a critical value @xmath86 are qualitatively different to those when @xmath87 .",
    "choosing @xmath88 and updating both the links and @xmath89s at comparable timescales , we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the induced network dynamics . fig .",
    "[ figh ] reports typical results for a simple discretized version of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) with @xmath90 ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ figh ] ) . as in the two previous models ,",
    "we find a discontinuous transition between a sparse and a dense network state , characterized by hysteresis effects . when the network is sparse , diffusion is ineffective in homogenizing growth .",
    "hence the distance @xmath20 is typically beyond the threshold @xmath15 , thus slowing down the link formation process . on the other hand , with a dense network",
    ", diffusion rapidly succeeds in narrowing the gaps between the @xmath91s of different nodes , which in turn has a positive effect on network formation . as before ,",
    "the phase transition and hysteresis is a result of the positive feedback that exists between the dynamics of the @xmath91 and the adjustment of the network . in the stationary state",
    "we find that @xmath92 grows exponentially in time , i.e. @xmath93 .",
    "notably , the growth process is much faster ( i.e. @xmath94 is much higher ) in the dense network equilibrium than in the sparse one , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figh ] .",
    "finally , we note that when diffusion is very strong compared to the idiosyncratic shocks in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) ",
    "i.e. @xmath95  we expect a much smaller distance @xmath20 between agents in the same component compared to agents in different components .",
    "thus the model becomes similar to the first one in this limit , in the same way the second model did for @xmath96 .",
    "( top ) and growth rate @xmath94 ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath32 computed in numerical simulations of a discretized version of the model with eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we iterate the equation @xmath97 where @xmath5 runs on the local neighborhood of @xmath4 , including @xmath4 , @xmath98 is a small time interval , and @xmath99 is a gaussian variable with mean @xmath100 and variance @xmath98 .",
    "this equation describes the strong - noise limit of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) and it is obtained by setting @xmath101 when @xmath102 ( and @xmath103^{2}$ ] ) . here",
    "we use @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( solid circles ) and @xmath108 ( open diamonds ) . ]",
    "in this paper we have proposed a general theoretical setup to study the dynamics of a social network that is flexible enough to admit a wide variety of particular specifications .",
    "we have studied three such specifications , each illustrating a distinct way in which the network dynamics may interplay with the adjustment of node attributes . in all these cases , network evolution displays the three features ( sharp transitions , resilience , and equilibrium co - existence ) that empirical research has found to be common to many social - network phenomena .",
    "our analysis indicates that these features arise as a consequence of the cumulative self - reinforcing effects induced by the interplay of two complementary considerations . on the one hand",
    ", there is the subprocess by which agent similarity is enhanced across linked ( or close - by ) agents . on the other hand ,",
    "there is the fact that the formation of new links is much easier between similar agents .",
    "when such a feedback process is triggered , it provides a powerful mechanism that effectively offsets the link decay induced by volatility .",
    "the similarity - based forces driving the dynamics of the model are at work in many socio - economic environments .",
    "thus , even though fruitful economic interaction often requires that the agents involved display some complementary diversity  in certain dimensions ( e.g. buyers and sellers ) , a key prerequisite is also that agents can coordinate in a number of other dimensions ( e.g. technological standards or trading conventions ) .",
    "analogous considerations arise as well in the evolution of many other social phenomena ( e.g. the burst of social pathologies discussed above ) that , unlike what is claimed e.g. by crane @xcite , can hardly be understood as a process of epidemic contagion on a _ given _ network .",
    "it is by now well understood @xcite that such epidemic processes do _ not _ match the phenomenology ( a)-(c ) reported in empirical research .",
    "our model suggests that a satisfactory account of these phenomena must aim at integrating both the dynamics _ on _ the network with that _ of _ the network itself as part of a genuinely co - evolutionary process .",
    "we characterize the long run behavior of the network in terms of the stationary degree distribution @xmath109 , which is the fraction of agents with @xmath110 neighbors .",
    "this corresponds to approximating the network with a random graph ( see @xcite ) , an approximation which is rather accurate in the cases we discuss here .",
    "we focus on the limit @xmath111 , for which the analysis is simpler , but finite size corrections can be studied within this same approach .",
    "the degree distribution satisfies a master equation @xcite , which is specified in terms of the transition rates @xmath112 for the addition or removal of a link , for an agent linked with @xmath110 neighbors .",
    "while @xmath113 always takes the same form , the transition rate @xmath114 for the addition of a new link depends on the particular specification of the distance @xmath20 . for the first model @xmath115 if the two agents are in different components and @xmath116 if they are in the same . in the large @xmath39 limit",
    "the latter case only occurs with some probability if the graph has a giant component @xmath117 which contains a finite fraction @xmath118 of nodes . for random graphs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) the fraction of nodes in @xmath117 is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the generating function and @xmath121 is the probability that a link , followed in one direction , does not lead to the giant component .",
    "the latter satisfies the equation @xmath122 .",
    "hence @xmath123 is the probability an agent with @xmath110 neighbours has no links connecting him to the giant component , and hence is itself not part of the giant component .",
    "then the rate of addition of links , in the first model , takes the form @xmath124,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath125 comes because each node can either initiate or receive a new link .",
    "the stationary state condition of the master equation leads to the following equation for @xmath126 @xmath127\\phi ( s)-2(1-\\epsilon ) \\gamma \\phi ( us )   \\label{phis}\\ ] ] which can be solved numerically to the desired accuracy .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ phis ] ) is a self - consistent problem , because the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath121 depend on the solution @xmath126 .",
    "the solution of this equation is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] .",
    "either one or three solutions are found , depending on the parameters . in the latter case ,",
    "the intermediate solution is unstable ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] ) , and it separates the basins of attraction of the two stable solutions within the present mean field theory .",
    "numerical simulations reveal that the the mean field approach is very accurate away from the phase transition although it overestimates the size of the coexistence region .",
    "now we turn to the second model , where each node displays one out of a finite set of attributes . in order to simplify the analysis , we approximate the prevailing network @xmath27 with a random graph with poisson degree distribution and average degree @xmath28 , i.e. a graph where any given link @xmath11 is present with probability @xmath130 . though not exact",
    ", this approximation is rather accurate as confirmed by numerical simulations , and it allows us to clarify the behavior of the model in a simple and intuitive way .",
    "( a more precise solution , which relies on a more accurate description of the network topology can also be derived , yielding no essential differences . )",
    "the solution of the potts model on random graphs of ref . @xcite ( with temperature @xmath131 ) allows us to compute the probability that two randomly chosen nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 have @xmath132 .",
    "given the poisson approximation , such a probability is given by a function @xmath133 of the average degree @xmath28 and @xmath58 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ figpic ] . equalizing the link destruction and",
