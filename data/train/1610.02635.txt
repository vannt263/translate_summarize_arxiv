    "traditionally , the production of the electroweak gauge vector bosons is considered as a benchmark for understanding the dynamics of the strong and the electroweak interactions in the standard model .",
    "it is also an important test to assess the validity of collider data .",
    "many collaborations have reported numerous sets of measurements , probing different events in variant dynamical regions , in direct or indirect relation with such processes , to count a few see the references @xcite . among the most recent of these reports",
    "are the measurements of the production of @xmath2 bosons at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 collaborations , for proton - proton collisions at the @xmath16 for @xmath17 , with different kinematical regions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 data are in the forward pseudorapidity region ( @xmath18 ) while the @xmath1 measurements are in th central domain ( @xmath19 ) .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we have successfully utilized the transverse momentum dependent ( @xmath20 ) unintegrated parton distribution functions ( @xmath5 ) of the @xmath12-factorization ( the references @xcite ) , namely the @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) formalisms in the leading order ( @xmath21 ) and the next - to - leading order ( @xmath4 ) to calculate the inclusive production of the @xmath22 and the @xmath2 gauge vector bosons , in the proton - proton and the proton - antiproton inelastic collisions @xmath23 in order to increase the precision of the calculations , we have used a complete set of @xmath24 @xmath4 partonic sub - processes , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the produced gauge vector boson . @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the 4-momenta of the incoming and the out - going partons .",
    "the results underwent comprehensive and rather lengthy comparisons and it was concluded that the calculations in the @xmath9 formalism are more successful in describing the existing experimental data ( with the center - of - mass energies of @xmath30 and @xmath31 tev ) from the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 collaborations @xcite . the success of the @xmath9 scheme ( despite being of the @xmath21 and suffering from some misalignment with its theory of origin , i.e. the @xmath32-@xmath33-@xmath34-@xmath35-@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) evolution equations , @xcite ) can be traced back to the particular physical constraints that rule its kinematics . to find extensive discussions regarding the structure and the applications of the @xmath5 of @xmath12-factorization",
    ", the reader may refer to the references @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , arriving the new data from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 collaborations , the references @xcite , gives rise to the necessity of repeating our calculations at the @xmath38 .",
    "this is in part due to the very interesting rapidity domain of the @xmath0 measurements , since in the forward rapidity sector ( @xmath39 ) , one can effectively probe very small values of the bjorken variable @xmath40 ( @xmath40 being the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the parent hadron , carried by the parton at the top of the partonic evolution ladder ) , where the gluonic distributions dominate and hence the transverse momentum dependency of the particles involving in the partonic sub - processes becomes important .    in the present work ,",
    "we intend to calculate the transverse momentum and the rapidity distributions of the cross - section of production of the @xmath2 boson using our @xmath4 level diagrams ( from the reference @xcite ) and the @xmath5 of the @xmath9 formalism .",
    "the @xmath5 will be prepared using the @xmath41 of @xmath42 , @xcite . in the following section",
    ", the reader will be presented with a brief introduction to the @xmath43 framework ( i.e. @xmath4 @xmath44 matrix elements and @xmath21 @xmath5 ) that is utilized to perform these computations .",
    "the section [ sec : ii ] also includes the main description of the @xmath9 formalism in the @xmath12-factorization procedure . finally , the section [ sec : iii ] is devoted to results , discussions and a thoroughgoing conclusion .",
    "generally speaking , the total cross - section for an inelastic collision between two hadrons ( @xmath45 ) can be expressed as a sum over all possible partonic cross - sections in every possible momentum configuration : @xmath46 in the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectfully represent the longitudinal fraction and the transverse momentum of the parton @xmath49 , while @xmath50 are the density functions of the @xmath51 parton .",
    "the second scale , @xmath52 , are the ultra - violet cutoffs related to the virtuality of the exchanged particle ( or particles ) during the inelastic scattering . @xmath53",
    "are the partonic cross - sections of the given particles . for the production of the @xmath2 boson ,",
    "the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) comes down to ( for a detailed description see the reference @xcite ) @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 are the rapidities of the produced particles ( since @xmath58 in the infinite momentum frame , i.e. @xmath59 ) .",
    "@xmath60 are the azimuthal angles of the incoming and the out - going partons at the partonic cross - sections .",
    "@xmath61 represent the matrix elements of the partonic sub - processes in the given configurations .",
    "the reader can find a number of comprehensive discussions over the means and the methods of deriving analytical prescriptions of these quantities in the references @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is the center of mass energy squared .",
    "additionally , in the proton - proton center of mass frame , one can utilize the following definitions for the kinematic variables : @xmath63 defining the transverse mass of the produced particles , @xmath64 , we can write , @xmath65    furthermore , the density functions of the incoming partons , @xmath66 ( which represent the probability of finding a parton at the semi - hard process of the partonic scattering , with the longitudinal fraction @xmath40 of the parent hadron , the transverse momentum @xmath12 and the hard - scale @xmath67 ) can be defined in the framework of @xmath12-factorization , through the @xmath9 formalism : @xmath68 ,      \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] the @xmath69 form factor , @xmath70 , factors over the virtual contributions from the @xmath21 @xmath37 equations , by defining a virtual ( loop ) contributions as : @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is the @xmath21 @xmath44 running coupling constant , @xmath74 are the so - called splitting functions in the @xmath21 , parameterizing the probability of finding a parton with the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath40 to be emitted form a parent parton with the fraction @xmath75 , while @xmath76 , see the references @xcite .",
    "the infrared cutoff parameter , @xmath77 , is a visualization of the angular ordering constrtaint ( @xmath78 ) , as a consequanse of the color coherence effect of successive gluonic emittions @xcite , defined as @xmath79 .",
    "limiting the upper boundary on @xmath80 integration by @xmath77 , excludes @xmath81 form the integral equation and automatically prevents facing the soft gluon singularities , @xcite .",
    "additionally , the @xmath82 are the single - scaled parton distribution functions ( @xmath41 ) , i.e. the solutions of the @xmath21 @xmath37 evolution equation .",
    "the required @xmath41 for solving the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) are provided in the form of phenomenological libraries , e.g. the @xmath83 libraries , the reference @xcite , where the calculation of the single - scaled functions have been carried out using the deep inelastic scattering data on the @xmath84 structure function of the proton .",
    "now , one can carry out the numerical calculation of the equation ( [ eq4 ] ) using the @xmath85 algorithm in the monte - carlo integration , @xcite . to do this",
    ", we have chosen the hard - scale of the @xmath5 as : @xmath86 and set the upper bound on the transverse momentum integrations of the equation ( [ eq4 ] ) to be @xmath87 , with @xmath88 one can easily confirm that since the @xmath5 of @xmath9 quickly vanish in the @xmath89 domain , further domain have no contribution into our results . also we limit the rapidity integrations to @xmath90 $ ] , since @xmath91 and according to the equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , further domain has no contribution into our results .",
    "the choice of above hard scale is reasonable for the production of the z bosons , as has been discussed in the reference @xcite .",
    "finally , we choose @xmath92 to define the density of the incoming partons in the non - perturbative region , i.e. @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "this appears to be a natural choice , since ( see the references @xcite ) @xmath95",
    "using the theory and the notions of the previous sections , one can calculate the production rate of the @xmath2 gauge vector boson for the center - of - mass energy of @xmath96 @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath41 of martin et al @xcite , @xmath42 , are used as the input functions to feed the equations ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the results are the double - scale @xmath5 of the @xmath9 schemes .",
    "these @xmath5 are in turn substituted into the equation ( [ eq4 ] ) to construct the @xmath98 cross - sections in the framework of @xmath12-factorization .",
    "one must note that the experimental data of the @xmath0 collaboration , @xcite , and the preliminary data of the @xmath1 collaboration , @xcite , are produced in different dynamical setups ; the @xmath0 data are in the forward rapidity region , @xmath99 , while @xmath1 data are in a central rapidity sector , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "we have imposed the same restrictions in our calculations .",
    "thus , in the figure [ fig1 ] we present the reader with a comparison between the different contributions into the differential cross - sections of the production of @xmath2 , ( @xmath101 ) , as a function of the transverse momentum ( @xmath102 ) of the produced particles , in the @xmath9 scheme .",
    "one readily notices that the contributions from the @xmath103 ( the so - called gluon - gluon fusion process ) dominate the the production .",
    "the share of other production vertices is small ( but not entirely negligible ) compared to these main contributions .",
    "this is to extent different from our observations in the smaller center - of - mass energies ( see the section v of the reference @xcite ) .",
    "also , differential cross - sections are considerably larger at the central rapidity region compared to the results in the forward sector .",
    "the total differential cross - section of the production of @xmath2 vector boson is calculated within the figure [ fig2 ] , as the sum of the constituting partonic sub - processes ( see the relation ( [ eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out for the center - of - mass energy @xmath38 and plotted as a function of the transverse momentum of the produced particle . in the panels ( a ) and ( c )",
    ", the contributions from the individual sub - processes have been compared to each other .",
    "the results in these panels respectfully correspond to the forward rapidity region , @xmath99 ( with the addition of @xmath104 and @xmath105 constraints , corresponding for the experimental measurements of the @xmath0 collaboration , the reference @xcite ) and to the central rapidity region , @xmath100 ( with the addition of @xmath106 and @xmath105 constraints , corresponding for the perlimanary measurements of the @xmath1 collaboration , the reference @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations have been performed , using the @xmath9 @xmath5 and the @xmath41 of @xmath83 .",
    "the panels ( b ) and ( d ) illustrate our results in their corresponding uncertainty bounds , compared to the data of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 collaborations .",
    "the uncertainty bounds have been calculated , by means of manipulating the hard - scale , @xmath67 , of the @xmath5 by a factor of 2 , since this is the only free parameter in our framework .",
    "also , as expected for the both regions , the contributions from the @xmath107 sub - process dominate , @xmath108    the figure [ fig3 ] presents the differential cross - section of the production of @xmath2 vector boson , @xmath109 , as a function of the rapidity of the produced boson ( @xmath110 ) at the center - of - mass energy of @xmath38 in the @xmath9 formalism .",
    "the notion of the figure is similar to that of the figure [ fig2 ] : the panels ( a ) and ( c ) illustrate the contributions of each of the sub - processes into the total production rate , while the total results have been subjected to comparison with the experimental data of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 collaborations ( the references @xcite ) , within their corresponding uncertainty bounds , in the panels ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "one finds that our calculations are in general agreement with the experimental measurements .",
    "overall , it appears that our @xmath43 framework is generally successful in describing the corresponding experimental measurements in the explored energy range .",
    "this success if by part owed to the @xmath5 of @xmath9 , which as an effective model , has been very successful in producing a realistic theory in order to describe the experiment , see the references @xcite .",
    "one however should note that having a semi - successful prediction from the framework of @xmath12-factorization by itself is a success , since our calculations utilizing these @xmath5 have inherently a considerably larger error compared to those from the @xmath111 @xmath44 or even the @xmath4 @xmath44 , presented here by the relatively large uncertainty region .",
    "this is because we are incorporating the single - scaled @xmath41 ( with their already included uncertainties ) to form double - scaled @xmath5 with additional approximations and further uncertainties .",
    "being able to provide predictions with a desirable accuracy would require a thorough universal fit for these frameworks , see the reference @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath12-factorization framework , despite its simplicity and its computational advantages , see the reference @xcite , can provide us with a valuable insight regarding the transverse momentum dependency of various high - energy @xmath44 events .    in summary , throughout the present work",
    ", we have calculated the production rate of the @xmath2 gauge vector boson in the framework of @xmath12-factorization , using a @xmath43 framework and the @xmath5 of the @xmath9 formalism .",
    "the calculations have been compared with the experimental data of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 collaborations .",
    "our calculation , within its uncertainty bounds , are in good agreement with the experimental measurements .",
    "we also reconfirm that the @xmath9 prescription , despite its theoretical disadvantages and its simplistic computational approach , has a remarkable behavior toward describing the experiment .",
    "@xmath112 would like to acknowledge the research council of university of tehran and the institute for research and planning in higher education for the grants provided for him .",
