    "traditionally the model of two - level system ( tls ) is used to describe the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with atoms @xcite .",
    "this model is quite reasonable if radiation frequency and transition frequency of the corresponding two levels are very close to each other .",
    "it was suggested to utilize rydberg atoms controlled by electromagnetic fields as qubits in quantum information technologies @xcite .",
    "there are other implementations of the qubits .",
    "trapped ions @xcite,@xcite , semiconductor quantum dots @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions can be used for this purpose .",
    "qubits based on the josephson junctions are recognized now to be the most promising for realization of quantum information processing devices ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) . there is a technological opportunity to couple qubits via transmission lines .",
    "individual photons can act as transmitters of quantum states between remote qubits .",
    "the aforesaid illustrates motivations to study tls coupled to transmission lines .",
    "atoms having a large dipole moment ( rydberg atoms ) as well as transmission lines ( including optical waveguides ) that concentrate radiation energy in small volumes are used to increase the coupling .",
    "strong interaction is desired for many applications whose aim is to achieve effective influence of one subsystem on the other . at the same time increase of interaction results in more pronounced nonlinearity of the system .",
    "this complicates theoretical analysis .",
    "therefore many theoretical results were obtained only numerically ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , analysis can be simplified considerably for some particular states of the system .",
    "first of all , a single - photon fock state of the incident radiation should be mentioned ( see , for example , recent papers @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "also things get simplified if the incident light is in a coherent state .",
    "for example , ref .",

    "@xcite gives a possibility not only to obtain the reflectance and transmittance of a wave packet but also to study spatial structure of outgoing radiation and its dependence on the incident pulse shape .",
    "moreover , paper @xcite describes effective photon - photon `` interaction '' induced by coupling of the radiation with atoms .",
    "different formalisms are used in the cited papers .",
    "method of scattering matrix @xcite which is equivalent to the input - output formalism @xcite is applied to photon scattering by tls in @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite use an alternative approach based on calculation of poynting vectors to study similar physical systems .",
    "recently we have applied method of photon phase - space distribution function to the problem of light propagation in the earth atmosphere @xcite , @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use this method for description of light propagation in waveguides .",
    "we obtain a spatial structure and spectrum of the transmitted and reflected radiation which are useful for design of radiation with desired properties . besides we analyze physical nature of the phase - space distribution functions .",
    "it is shown that they , like @xmath0 or @xmath1distributions , can be negative for some specific parameters of the incident radiation .    also equations describing fluctuations of outgoing photons are derived and solved . we show that the variance of the reflected radiation may be essentially lower than that of a coherent - state pulse .",
    "thus , few - photon pulses with favorable statistical properties can be generated in course of radiation - tls interaction .    in the next section ,",
