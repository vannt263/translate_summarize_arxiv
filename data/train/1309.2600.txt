    "as a dynamical process in epidemics , noise increasingly plays an important role when using models to understand and predict disease outbreaks .",
    "stochastic effects figure prominently in finite populations , which can range from ecological dynamics  @xcite to childhood epidemics in cities  @xcite . for populations with seasonal forcing",
    ", noise comes into play in the prediction of large outbreaks  @xcite .",
    "external random perturbations , such as those arising from random migrations  @xcite , change the probabilistic prediction of epidemic outbreak amplitudes as well as their control  @xcite .",
    "epidemic stochasticity may arise from several sources , such as internal interactions due to random contacts in finite well - mixed populations  @xcite , as well as contacts on structured contact networks  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it may arise from random external fluctuations , such as immigration perturbations  @xcite .",
    "in many cases , whether noise arises externally or internally , it may have far ranging effects on outbreak predictability .",
    "for example , noise impacts predictability in climate and disease  @xcite , produces random - looking outbreaks from its interaction with mass action terms  @xcite , and amplifies the peaks of epidemics due to its interaction with resonant frequencies  @xcite .",
    "other areas of noise research have been postulated as the source of chaos in epidemics  @xcite , whereby noise explicitly interacts with the underlying topology of the epidemics model . as a direct consequence of its topological interaction , random chaotic - like",
    "switching may occur between small amplitude and large outbreaks when including the effects of stochasticity  @xcite .    to connect with data ,",
    "time series analysis from spatio - temporal cases has been done to generate parameters for use in epidemic models .",
    "tools from nonlinear time series analysis of measles data  @xcite have pointed to the important realization that any mathematical models might need to capture chaotic behavior , which is deterministic and predictable only in the short term . as a result",
    ", time series data analysis has centered on the assumption that a deterministic processes dominates the time series , but quantifying determinism from the statistics may be inconclusive . in  @xcite , analysis specifically points out that complex , or chaotic behavior may be detected , even when it is not deterministic .",
    "for example , sensitive dependence on initial conditions in short , noisy , non - chaotic time series , such as epidemic data , may be indicated by positive lyapunov exponents .    another time series analysis method which also includes noise",
    "is that of time - series susceptible - infected - recovered ( tsir ) modeling  @xcite . here",
    "the authors do local fits of time - series data from england and wales to get measures of local reproductive rates of infection .",
    "the main assumption is that in the pre - vaccine years , all newborns introduced into the population as susceptible individuals become infected . however , as constructed the model lacks predictive power since the parameter fits , which include noise parameters , are local in time",
    ". it also excludes any latency period of infection , since it only considers models of sir type .",
    "connections of data with full models which are higher dimensional are difficult if one includes other relevant epidemiological parameters and realistic noise .",
    "coupled patch models of cities have limited data time series when compared to the large simulation model dimension .",
    "such limited data sets imply the need for accurate lower dimensional models to reduce parameter unknowns .",
    "latency of infection , which introduces a series of exposed classes approximating mean delay times , is one example which generates high dimensional models , but is omitted in modeling diseases used in the tsir approach .",
    "however , it is known rigorously that the dynamics in higher dimensional deterministic models relaxes asymptotically onto lower dimensional hyper - surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in these reductions are purely deterministic , and rely on nonlinear center manifold reduction methods .",
    "the advantage in doing center manifold reductions is that if one can only observe certain components of a disease , then it is possible to explicitly construct a function which relates the unobserved components ( such as latency , or asymptomatic infections ) , to those explicitly measured , or observed .",
    "the current state - of - the - art , however , now shows stochastic model reduction must be done correctly in order to connect with observed data  @xcite .",
    "when examining models based on observed data , it will improve prediction by examining full stochastic models which include all epidemiological factors , and then reduce them properly to lower dimensions , whereby noise is projected properly .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine a method of nonlinear , stochastic projection so that the deterministic and stochastic dynamics interact correctly on the lower - dimensional manifold and predict correctly the outbreak dynamics when compared to the full system when fitted to data . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we showed how noise affects the timing of outbreaks for a time independent system .",
    "therefore , it was concluded that it is essential to produce a low - dimensional system which captures the correct timing of the outbreaks as well as the amplitude and phase of any recurrent behavior for any given measured realization of an outbreak .    for stochastic model reduction ,",
    "there exist several potential methods for general problems . for systems with certain spectral requirements ,",
    "the existence of a stochastic center manifold was proven in  @xcite . non - rigorous stochastic normal form analysis ( which leads to the stochastic center manifold ) was performed in  @xcite , as well as others  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the construction of the stochastic normal form coordinate transform is transparent , so we used this method to derive the reduced stochastic center manifold equation when there is no seasonal forcing using standard parameters  @xcite .    here",
    "we take a different approach , and consider the data to fit a predictive model of seir type , and then perform stochastic reduction in a time dependent system . rather than perform local temporal fits of a model to data , the data is fit over a long period of time compared to the infectious period . then , given the parameters and noise , we explicitly construct the stochastic manifold .",
    "the dynamics which lives on the manifold allows us to predict the unobserved exposed , yet not infectious , individuals explicitly .",
    "we begin by describing a stochastic version of the seir model found in  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that a given population can be divided into four classes , each of which evolves in time .",
    "the classes are defined as follows :    1 .   the class of susceptible individuals is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "each susceptible individual may contract the disease from an infectious individual .",
    "2 .   the class of exposed individuals is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "each exposed individual has been infected by the disease but is not yet infectious .",
    "3 .   the class of infectious individuals is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "each infectious individual is capable of transmitting the disease to a susceptible individual .",
    "4 .   the class of recovered individuals is denoted by @xmath3 . each recovered individual is immune to the disease .",
    "we also assume that the population size , denoted by @xmath4 , is constant so that @xmath5 . denoting @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , then the population class variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represent fractions of the total population and @xmath14 . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the governing equations of our stochastic seir model are given as    ( t)&=-(t ) i(t)s(t ) -s(t),[e : sdot ] + ( t)&=(t ) i(t)s(t ) -(+)e(t),[e : edot ] + ( t)&=e(t ) -(+)i(t)+i(t)(t),[e : idot ] + ( t)&=i(t ) -r(t),[e : rdot ]    where @xmath15 is the standard deviation of the noise intensity @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a stochastic white noise term that is characterized by the following correlation functions : @xmath18 @xmath19 we only consider multiplicative noise in the infectives since that is the one quantity that is measurable as a function of cases .",
    "however , since not every person who contracts a disease will be treated by a doctor , and since some doctors may neglect to consistently file reports with the monitoring agencies , the data is inherently noisy .",
    "in addition , restricting the noise to observations renders the problem easier to understand analytically .    in eqs .",
    "( [ e : sdot])-([e : rdot ] ) , the birth and death rate are described by @xmath20 , the rate of infection is described by @xmath21 , and the rate of recovery is described by @xmath22 .",
    "additionally , the contact rate @xmath23 fluctuates seasonally , and we have chosen to represent @xmath24 with the following two - harmonic sinusoidal forcing function : @xmath25.\\label{e : beta}\\ ] ]    it should be noted that if one neglects the @xmath26 stochastic term , then the deterministic form of eqs .",
    "( [ e : sdot])-([e : rdot ] ) is such that @xmath27 . in the stochastic problem",
    ", the four components will not necessarily sum to unity due to fluctuations in the total population .",
    "but since the noise has zero mean , on average the total population will remain close to unity .",
    "this fact , along with the fact that @xmath28 is decoupled from eqs .",
    "( [ e : sdot])-([e : idot ] ) , allows us to assume that the dynamics are described sufficiently by eqs .",
    "( [ e : sdot])-([e : idot ] ) .",
    "we will reduce the dimension of the system given by eqs .",
    "( [ e : sdot])-([e : idot ] ) using deterministic center manifold theory .",
    "the analysis begins by neglecting the @xmath26 term and considering the autonomous seir model in the absence of periodic drive so that @xmath29 .",
    "there are two steady states of the deterministic system .",
    "the first steady state corresponds to a disease - free , or extinct , equilibrium state and is given as @xmath30 the second steady state corresponds to an endemic equilibrium state and is given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 biologically , @xmath33 is interpreted as the basic reproductive rate and gives the number of secondary cases produced by a lone infectious individual in a population of susceptible individuals during one infectious period . from here on , we assume that @xmath34 so that an endemic equilibrium always exists .    a general nonlinear system may be transformed so that the system s linear part has a block diagonal form consisting of three matrix blocks .",
    "the first matrix block will possess eigenvalues with positive real part ; the second matrix block will possess eigenvalues with negative real part ; and the third matrix block will possess eigenvalues with zero real part .",
    "these three matrix blocks are respectively associated with the unstable eigenspace , the stable eigenspace , and the center eigenspace .",
    "if there are no eigenvalues with positive real part , then the orbits will rapidly decay to the center eigenspace .",
    "equations  ( [ e : sdot])-([e : idot ] ) can not be written in a block diagonal form with one matrix block possessing eigenvalues with negative real part and the other matrix block possessing eigenvalues with zero real part . even though it is possible to construct a center manifold from a system not in separated block form  @xcite , it is much easier to apply the center manifold theory to a system with separated stable and center directions .",
    "therefore , we transform the original system given by eqs .",
    "( [ e : sdot])-([e : idot ] ) to a new system of equations that will have the eigenvalue structure that is needed to apply center manifold theory .",
    "the theory allows one to find an invariant center manifold that passes through a fixed point and to which one can restrict the new transformed system .      to ease the analysis",
    ", we define a new set of variables , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",

    "we have considered a stochastic seir model where the contact rate fluctuates seasonally and where multiplicative noise acts on the governing equation for infectious individuals . in this way , we emulated the noise found within data of measurable infectious individuals in a population .",
    "the main result of our work was the derivation of a lower - dimensional model whose solution , both in amplitude and timing of outbreaks , agrees with the solution of the higher - dimensional original model .",
    "there are many types of high - dimensional stochastic models which lend themselves to model reduction .",
    "for example , a time delay is often included in epidemic models when one wishes to model a disease exposure time . to reduce the analytical complications introduced by the time delay , one can approximate the delay through a cascade of hundreds of exposed compartments  @xcite .",
    "other high dimensional models are generated when individual interactions within a population are modeled as a network  @xcite .",
    "researchers have considered epidemics on a variety of static networks , including small world networks  @xcite and transportation networks  @xcite , as well as on adaptive networks , where individuals may break their interaction connections and `` rewire '' to form new interaction connections  @xcite .    in these high dimensional model examples ,",
    "one generally needs to resort to massive computation and analytical results are usually very difficult or impossible to obtain . in particular , it is not currently possible to perform these computations in real - time .",
    "however , many high dimensional epidemic models do contain time scales that are well separated .",
    "therefore , it is possible to take advantage of these well - separated time scales to reduce the dimension of the model . in this article",
    "we have performed just such a model reduction .",
    "the stochastic seir model with seasonal fluctuations , which contains fast collapse and slow dynamic time scales , illustrates the power of our method .",
    "it is important to note that the analysis could straightforwardly be extended to a seir - type model where the exposed class was modeled using hundreds of compartments .",
    "the mathematical / computational techniques used here are general , and can be applied to many population dynamics problems .",
    "our analysis started by transforming the deterministic seir system of equations to a new system of equations with a specific eigenvalue structure .",
    "employing center manifold theory , we were able to find the reduced system of equations that describes the dynamics on the lower dimensional manifold . due to the specific nature of the noise",
    ", we can use the deterministic center manifold equation to reduce the stochastic seir model .",
    "the end result is a reduced stochastic model that accurately captures the timing of the initial disease outbreak as well as the timing of subsequent outbreaks for decades long times compared to the infectious period .",
    "the solution to the reduced stochastic model additionally agrees very well in amplitude with the solution to the original high - dimensional model .",
    "moreover , the reduced model is robust in that it accurately captures the timing and amplitude for a wide range of parameter values .    as a direct application to observations",
    ", we have also used our deterministic model to fit actual measles data .",
    "once the fitting parameters were determined we solved our reduced stochastic model and compared the resulting solution with the data . beyond providing good agreement with the data",
    ", we saw that a large noise intensity was needed before the stochastic solution significantly deviated from the data . in this way",
    ", the stochastic solutions are very robust to noise .",
    "we were able to further identify the noise effects through cross - correlation computations .",
    "generally , the actual data that is measured in society is that of the number of observed cases . not only are exposed individuals not measured , an exposed individual often will not even know of the exposure and the infection that is to come .",
    "however , with our novel stochastic reduction method , we are now able to predict how many unobserved exposed individuals there are in a population based solely on the measurable number of infectious individuals .    in summary , a new method of stochastic model reduction for an epidemiological model with seasonal fluctuations has been performed . by capturing both the timing of disease outbreak as well as the amplitude of the outbreak for long temporal scales ,",
    "our reduced model provides impressive time series prediction . by accurately modeling actual stochastic disease data",
    ", we enable the application of novel control methods where the timing of vaccine delivery and a disease outbreak is important . moreover , the method is general , and may be extended to a variety of compartmental and network models , including models with a high dimension .",
