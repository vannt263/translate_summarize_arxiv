    "charge transport properties in conjugated polymers have attracted sustained attention from both academic and industrial researchers , since it was discovered in the 1970s that the electrical conductivity of trans - polyacetylene ( pa ) can be improved significantly by doping with strong electron acceptors or donors @xcite .",
    "many electronic devices have been fabricated based on these conjugated polymers.@xcite    all the conducting polymers can generally be sorted into two classes .",
    "the first class is trans - polyacetylene , in which there exists a twofold degeneracy of ground state energy distinguished by the positions of the double and single bonds .",
    "the degenerate ground state of trans - polyacetylene leads to solitons @xcite as the important excitations and the dominant charge storage species , which take the form of domain walls separating different districts of opposite single and double bonds alternation patterns . the second class of conducting polymers is given by all the other systems except trans - polyacetylene , in which the ground state degeneracy is weakly lifted .",
    "so polarons and confined soliton pairs ( bipolarons ) @xcite instead of solitons are the important excitations and the dominant charge storage configurations for this class of conducting polymers .",
    "nowadays it has been widely accepted that these quasiparticles ( solitons , polarons and bipolarons ) are the fundamental charge carriers in conducting polymers .",
    "the studies of the dynamics of these charge carriers are therefore of great interest for the purpose of modulating or devising new organic electronic materials based on conjugated polymers .",
    "so far , there have been many extensive theoretical studies on polaron dynamics in conjugated polymers @xcite based on the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite , an improved hckel molecular orbital model , in which @xmath0-electrons are coupled to distortions in the polymer backbone by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "rakhmanova and conwell @xcite have considered the motion of a polaron under low and high electric fields respectively by using an adiabatic simulation in which the electronic energy is treated within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "their results show that the polaron can form and move in its entity in low electric fields but dissociates in high fields .",
    "the highest electric field strength under which the polaron can sustain is about 6 mv/@xmath1 .",
    "basko and conwell @xcite have also analyzed the dynamics of a polaron and found that the speed of a steadily moving polaron can not exceed the sound speed ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with those from the numerical results presented by arikabe _ et al _ @xcite but inconsistent with those given by johansson and stafstrm @xcite , who performed a nonadiabatic simulation in which transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are allowed . in johansson and stafstrm s work , the maximum velocity ( about 4@xmath6 )",
    "is reached at a high electric field strength ( @xmath7 3.5 mv/@xmath1 ) and at even higher electric field strengths the polaron will become unstable and dissociate",
    ".    in the ssh model only the electron - lattice interactions are considered and the electron - electron interactions are totally ignored . in order to improve this situation , di _ et al _ have considered extended hubbard model ( ehm ) combined with the ssh model and investigated the dynamics of polarons within this model at the level of an unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) approximation.@xcite they found that the localization of the polaron is enhanced and the stationary velocity of the polaron is decreased by both the on - site repulsions @xmath3 and the nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , they found that the local extremum of the stationary velocity of the polaron appears at @xmath8 .",
    "however , in recent years a lot of theoretical calculations of the static properties of conjugated polymers have shown that the electron correlation effect plays a very important role in determining the behavior of the charge carriers in conjugated polymers.@xcite for example , electron correlation is essential in obtaining correct pictures of the spin polarizations in trans - polyacetylene.@xcite therefore , theoretical simulations for polaron dynamics with electron correlations considered , which step beyond the scf level , are highly desirable .",
    "however , the calculations for large polymer systems with traditional advanced electron - correlation methods such as configuration interaction method ( ci ) , multi - configuration self - consistent field method ( mcscf ) , many - body moller - plesset perturbation theory ( mpn ) and coupled cluster method ( cc ) are currently still not feasible due to the huge computational costs .",
    "fortunately , the adaptive time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( tddmrg ) method @xcite can be used instead . in the context of 1d correlated electronic and bosonic systems ,",
    "the adaptive tddmrg has been found to be a highly reliable real - time simulation method at economic computational cost , for example in the context of magnetization dynamics @xcite , of spin - charge separation @xcite , or far - from equilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , zhao _ et al _ have performed adaptive tddmrg simulations for polaronic transport within a combined model of ssh and hubbard model to take the on - site coulomb interactions into account and found that that the velocity of the polaron is suppressed by the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath3.@xcite    in this paper , combining the ssh and extended hubbard model to take both the on - site coulomb interactions and nearest - neighbor electron - electron interactions into account , we simulate the motion of a polaron in conjugated polymers under an applied external electric field by using the adaptive tddmrg for the @xmath0-electron part and classical molecular dynamics ( md ) for the lattice backbone part .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an exhaustive picture of polaron transport in conducting polymers at a theoretical level with all relevant electron - electron interactions and correlations included and to show how the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath3 and nearest - neighbor electron - electron interactions @xmath4 influence the behavior of polaron transport in conducting polymers .",
    "we use the well - known and widely used ssh hamiltonian @xcite combined with the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) , and include the external electric field by an additional term : @xmath9 this hamiltonian is time - dependent , because the electric field @xmath10 is explicitly time - dependent .",
    "the @xmath0-electron part includes both the electron - phonon and the electron - electron interactions , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hopping integral between the @xmath13-th site and the ( @xmath14)-th site , while @xmath3 is the on - site coulomb interaction and @xmath4 denotes the nearest - neighbor electron - electron interaction . because the distortions of the lattice backbone are always within a certain limited extent , one can adopt a linear relationship between the hopping integral and the lattice displacements as @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the hopping integral for zero displacement , @xmath17 the lattice displacement of the @xmath13th site , and @xmath18 is the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "because the atoms move much slower than the electrons , we treat the lattice backbone classically with the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the elastic constant and @xmath21 is the mass of a site , such as that of a ch monomer for trans - polyacetylene .    the electric field @xmath10 directed along the backbone chain is uniform over the entire system .",
    "the field which is constant after a smooth turn - on is chosen to be @xmath22 ,     & \\text{for $ t < t_c$ , } \\\\      e_0 ,     & \\text{for $ t\\geq t_c$ , }      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the center , width and strength of the half gaussian pulse .",
    "this field gives the following contribution to the hamiltonian : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electron charge and @xmath28 is the unit distance constant of the lattice .",
    "the model parameters are those generally chosen for polyacetylene : @xmath16=2.5 ev , @xmath18=4.1 ev /  , @xmath20=21 ev / @xmath29 , @xmath21=1349.14 evfs@xmath29/@xmath29 , @xmath28=1.22 .@xcite the results are expected to be qualitatively valid for the other conjugated polymers .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath23=30 fs and @xmath24=25 fs ) are taken from the paper of fu _",
    "et al_.@xcite    for the purpose of performing real - time simulation of both the evolution of quantum @xmath0-electron part and the classical movement of the chain backbone , we adopt a newly developed real - time simulation method in which classical molecular dynamics is combined with the adaptive tddmrg .",
    "the main idea of this method is to evolve the @xmath0-electron part by the adaptive tddmrg and move the backbone part by classical md iteratively .",
    "details about this method can be found in recent papers @xcite .",
    "to investigate the dynamic properties of polarons , we simulate the polaron transport process in a single model conjugated polymer chain under a uniform external electric field .",
    "a polaron is different from a charged soliton in that it involves an unpaired electron and thus a nonzero @xmath30 . in our calculations ,",
    "we simulate a model chain containing @xmath31 monomers and @xmath32 @xmath0-electrons to present a polaron defect without degenerate ground states .",
    "the polaron is initially centered around site 30 and site 31 through imposing a constraint of reflection symmetry around the center between site 30 and site 31 . then , the dynamics of polaron transport in 160 femtoseconds ( fs ) is simulated by virtue of classical md combined with the adaptive tddmrg .",
    "firstly let us show the general time evolution picture of polaron transport in a conducting polymer .",
    "the time evolution of charge density and the staggered bond order parameter @xmath33 in a polymer chain with a polaron defect are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : g ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that both the charge density and the geometrical distortions do nt localize at one monomer . on the contrary ,",
    "the polaron defect spreads over a delocalized region with a length of tens of sites .",
    "one can also clearly see that during the entire time evolution process the geometrical distortion curve and net charge distribution shape for the polaron defect always stay coupled and show no obvious dispersion .",
    "this implies that the polaron defect is an inherent feature and the fundamental charge carrier in conducting polymer . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g ] , we can also see that a long lasting oscillatory `` tail '' appears behind the polaron defect center .",
    "this `` tail '' is generated by the inertia of those monomers to fulfill energy and momentum conservation ; they absorb the additional energy , preventing the further increase of the polaron velocity after a stationary value is reached .    in order to evaluate the velocity of polaron transport ,",
    "it is necessary to know the center postions of a polaron at different times .",
    "the center position of a defect can be derived from the charge density distribution picture or the bond length alternation pattern as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is defined according to the charge density @xmath36 or the staggered bond order parameter @xmath37 as @xmath38 in which @xmath39 is the dimerized lattice displacement of the pristine chain without defects .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : g ] , one can also find that , after the external electric field is smoothly turned on , the polaron is accelerated at first and then moves with a nearly constant velocity as one entity consisting of both the charge and the lattice deformation .",
    "we calculate the postions of the center of a polaron during the transport process according to eq .",
    "[ eq : po ] and show the temporal evolution of the polaron center position in fig .",
    "[ fig : po_t ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the center position of the polaron increases nearly linearly with the increase of time after the initial short - time acceleration .",
    "this implies the polaron defect is transported with a nearly constant velocity and supports our observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : g ] .",
    "therefore , only the stationary velocity will be considered for polaron transport in the following discussions . meanwhile",
    ", one also finds that the lattice distortion center always stays well together with the charge density center .",
    "but it should also be noticed that , under high electric field strength the deviation of the lattice distortion center position from the charge density center position may become much larger because the charge density moves much faster under high field and the lattice distortion can not catch up with the charge density .",
    "this separation between the charge center and lattice distortion center may lead to the dissociation of a polaron .",
    "the dissociation of a polaron under high electric field strength will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the dependence of the stationary velocity of a polaron @xmath40 on the electric field strength is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] .",
    "we find that @xmath40 increases with increasing electric field strength .",
    "apparently , the polaron velocity can easily exceed the sound speed ( @xmath41=0.15  / fs ) and the maximum velocity ( about 3@xmath6 ) is reached at a high electric field strength ( @xmath7 9 mv/@xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , a very interesting behavior of @xmath40 as a function of the electric field strength is observed .",
    "an ohmic region where @xmath40 increases nearly linearly with the electric field strength is found .",
    "this ohmic region extends approximately from 3 mv/@xmath1 to 9 mv/@xmath1 for the case of @xmath3=2.0 ev and @xmath4=1.0 ev . below 3 mv/@xmath1 the polaron velocity increases nonlinearly and when @xmath42 mv/@xmath1 the polaron becomes unstable and the charge will be decoupled from the lattice distortion .",
    "we illustrate the temporal evolutions of the polaron center postion under different external electric field strengths .",
    "we can find that the lattice distortion center stays well together with the charge center under low electric field strengths .",
    "however , the deviation of the lattice distortion center from the charge density center becomes much larger under higher electric field strengths because the charge density moves much faster under high field and the lattice distortion can not catch up with the charge density . under the electric field of 10 mv/@xmath1 ,",
    "the distance between the two centers becomes even larger than several unit distances , implying that the polaron has been completely dissociated . this dissociation can be clearly seen from the time evolution pictures of charge density and the staggered bond order parameter in a polymer chain with a polaron defect under a external electric field of 10 mv/@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_e ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : g_e ] . while the charge density accelerates to a high speed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_e ] , the original lattice distortion stays far behind the charge density with a distance of more than tens of unit distances .",
    "the charge density will induce new lattice distortion in the nearby region around the charge density center , while the original lattice distortion can hardly move further , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_e ] .",
    "therefore , the polaron defect has become completely dissociated under the high electric field . apparently , our calculated threshold field strength of around 10 mv/@xmath1 for polaron dissociation is in agreement with the value of 9.5 mv/@xmath1 obtained by ssh - ehm / uhf calculations by di _",
    "et al _ @xcite and much closer to the experimental determined value of about 15 mv/@xmath1 @xcite compared to the value of 6 mv/@xmath1 calculated by rakhmanova and conwell @xcite and 3.5 mv/@xmath1 calculated by johansson and stafstrm @xcite .",
    "the large deviations of the calculated threshold field strength from the experimental value by the latter two groups are due to the fact that they considered only the ssh model and considered no electron - electron interactions in their studies , and the agreement of ssh - ehm calculations with experimental results shows again that the inclusion of electron - electron interactions is vital for the theoretical studies of charge carriers in conducting polymers .",
    "another thing that should be noticed is that our @xmath3 value ( 2.0 ev ) and @xmath4 value ( 1.0ev ) are not the standard values for any special kind of polymers .",
    "here we use these two values only for the purpose to show how a polaronic transport will generally evolve and whether the inclusion of electron - electron interactions is important for a reasonable theoretical simulation of the polaronic transport process .",
    "the detailed discussion of how the on - site repulsions @xmath3 and the nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath4 will influence the polaronic transport will be shown in the next sections .      in order to study the influence of electron - electron interactions on polaron transport , we focus on the stationary velocity of a polaron @xmath40 calculated with different electron - electron interaction strengths under the constraint that the other parameters are fixed . as should be noticed that , the real conjugated polymer is with weak interactions .",
    "strong interactions will lead to too strong charge polarizations which are unrealistic . considering that we are only focusing on the study of real conjugated polymer system , in this work",
    "we adopt only the weak - interaction parameters ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "firstly , we study the hubbard model with only on - site coulomb interactions @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath44 in the ehm .",
    "the dependence of the polaron stationary velocity @xmath40 on the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath3 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_u ] .",
    "we find that @xmath40 decreases monotonically with the increasing @xmath3 value and its maximum value is achieved at @xmath3=0.0 ev .",
    "this can be easily understood because the variation of the charge carrier transport velocity is strongly related to the delocalization level of the charge carrier defect .",
    "the lattice tends to be occupied by one electron per site when the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 increases .",
    "therefore an increasing @xmath3 will lead to more localized charge density and a smaller defect width of the polaron and accordingly restrain the polaron transport .",
    "this analysis is supported by our calculated charge density width values of a static polaron @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath45 is calculated according to the following formula : @xmath46 ^ 2\\rho_n)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] through calculations we find the polaron width @xmath45 also decreases monotonically with an increasing @xmath3 value , from 10.10 ( @xmath3=0.0 ev ) to 9.68 ( @xmath3=1.5 ev ) and then to 7.62 ( @xmath3=4.0 ev ) .",
    "this sequence is in agreement with that of the polaron stationary velocity @xmath40 and supports our analysis of the relationship between the polaron transport velocity and the delocalization level of a polaron .",
    "actually , the change of the polaron delocalization can also be directly viewed through the geometrical picture of the static polaron defect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_u ] , the staggered bond order parameter @xmath37 of a static polaron calculated by different @xmath3 values is shown .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the lattice dimerization is enhanced and the polaron width becomes narrower while the @xmath3 value increases .",
    "all these pictures show that the polaron transport is suppressed by the on - site coulomb repulsions @xmath3 .",
    "the monotonic decrease picture of polaron transport velocity with on - site coulomb repulsions @xmath3 observed by us is in agreement with di _ et al _ s uhf calculations @xcite and zhao _ et al _ s recent adaptive tddmrg results @xcite , but not in accordance to our recent studies on charged soliton transport , in which we found that charged soliton transport velocity is non - monotonic in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the different behaviors of charge carrier transport with @xmath3 increasing is due to the different characteristics of charged solitons and polarons .",
    "it was found that the polaron defect is more delocalized than the charged soliton defect and the height of the charge density peaks in polarons is only roughly one half that of the charge density peaks in charged solitons.@xcite in a more localized case with large charge densities , as in a charged soliton , small @xmath3 may favor the charge carrier transport because the increasing on - site repulsion for large charge densities can make the electron ( or hole ) to hop more easily to the next site .",
    "therefore the different behaviors of charge carrier transport with @xmath3 increasing for charged solitons and polarons are reasonable .",
    "secondly , we also study the influence of nearest neighbor electron - electron interactions @xmath4 on the polaron transport process .",
    "the dependence of the stationary velocity of a polaron @xmath40 on the @xmath4 values is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_v ] , where @xmath3 values are supposed to be frozen to be zero .",
    "this assumption is not realistic because the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath3 are normally much stronger than the neighbor electron - electron interactions @xmath4 ; we make this assumption only for the purpose of studying of the influence of @xmath4 on the polaronic transport process without the effect of @xmath3 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_v ] , the situation is completely different from the case of an on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "interestingly , @xmath40 is non - monotonic in @xmath4 : it decreases to a shallow minimum at @xmath47 ev gradually and then increases again .",
    "in fact , similar to the the case discussed above with varying @xmath3 , the variation of @xmath40 with @xmath4 is also strongly related to changing the delocalization of the polaron defect . for small @xmath4 ,",
    "larger positive charge densities will be induced in the central part of a polaron defect while the induced negative charge densities at nearest neighbor sites are still relatively small , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : c_v ] .",
    "therefore the polaron defect tends to be more localized and consequently the polaron transport becomes more difficult .",
    "so , @xmath40 decreases while the value of @xmath4 increases from 0.0 ev to 1.2 ev as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_v ] .",
    "however , when nearest neighbor electron - electron interactions @xmath4 increase further and become dominant , very large charge polarization will be induced . therefore",
    ", the electron - hole attraction between opposite charge densities at nearest - neighbor sites will contribute much more significantly to the polaron system and favor the hoppings of the accumulated electrons ( or holes ) in the central part of a polaron defect to the neighbor sites . as shown in in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_v ] , the two positive charge density peaks are separated further when @xmath4 increases from 1.2 ev to 1.4 ev .",
    "this change leads to a more delocalized polaron defect and accordingly the increase of @xmath40 .",
    "our calculated polaron charge density width results , namely that @xmath45 decreases gradually from 10.10 ( @xmath4=0.0 ev ) to 9.37 ( @xmath4=1.2 ev ) and then increase gradually to 9.89 ( @xmath4=1.4 ev ) , support our analysis well . in order to directly view the change of delocalization level of the polaron defect through geometrical pictures",
    ", we also show the staggered bond order parameter @xmath37 of a static polaron calculated with different @xmath4 values in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_v ] .",
    "it is clearly shown that the lattice dimerization is enhanced and the polaron width becomes narrower with @xmath4 for small @xmath4 .",
    "we also find that the polaron becomes more delocalized with a smaller @xmath37 minimum while @xmath4 increases further from 1.2 ev to 1.4 ev .",
    "the change of polaron delocalization illustrated from the geometrical picture is in accordance to that has been shown in the charge density picture , verifying that small @xmath4 suppresses the polaronic transport while large @xmath4 favors the polaron transport .",
    "this non - monotonic picture of polaron transport velocity in @xmath4 is similar to that has been observed in charged soliton transport @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider the realistic case of conducting polymers in which both the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath3 and the nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath4 are taken into account . fig .",
    "[ fig : v_f ] shows the stationary transport velocity of a polaron @xmath40 as a function of @xmath3 for fixed values of @xmath48 ev , @xmath49 ev , @xmath4=1.0 ev and @xmath50 ev . generally , the @xmath40 behavior with variated @xmath3 and fixed @xmath4 values is quite similar to that has been illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_u ] in which @xmath4 is frozen to be 0.0 ev . it can be found that @xmath40 decreases monotonically with @xmath3 .",
    "meanwhile , we can also find that , @xmath40 seems to decrease more rapidly in large @xmath4 cases than in small @xmath4 cases for small @xmath3 .",
    "larger nearest - neighbor electron - electron interactions @xmath4 will lead to larger charge polarizations and of course the increasing on - site coulomb repulsions @xmath3 will suppress the transport of a polaron associated with larger charge polarizations more significantly comparing to the case with smaller charge polarizations",
    ". therefore the suppression of polaron transport by the on - site coulomb repulsions @xmath3 is more remarkable in large @xmath4 cases than in small @xmath4 cases .",
    "the monotonic decrease picture of polaron transport velocity with on - site coulomb repulsions @xmath3 observed by us is opposed to the non - monotonic picture obtained by di _",
    "et al _ through uhf calculations @xcite .",
    "they found a local extremum of the stationary velocity of the polaron can be achieved at @xmath8 .",
    "the difference between the results of the adaptive tddmrg and uhf calculations is due to the fact that the latter method ignores the important electron correlation effect .",
    "previous theoretical static studies have found that neglecting electron correlation effects will lead to an underestimation of the defect width as well as an overestimation of charge polarization.@xcite in a more localized case with large charge densities , presented by uhf calculations without the inclusion of electron correlation effect , introducing a small @xmath3 may favor the charge carrier transport because the increasing on - site repulsion for large charge densities can make the electron ( or hole ) to hop more easily to the next site .",
    "therefore , the difference between tddmrg calculations and uhf calculations shows again that the electron correlation effect plays an important role in describing the charge carrier properties .",
    "for a model conjugated polymer chain initially holding a polaron defect , described using the combined ssh - ehm model extended with an additional part for the influence of an external electric field , we have studied the dynamics of polaron transport through this chain by virtue of simulating the backbone monomer displacements with classical md and evolving the wavefunction for the @xmath0-electrons with the adaptive tddmrg .",
    "it is found that after a smooth turn - on of the external electric field the polaron is accelerated at first up to a stationary constant velocity as one entity consisting of both the charge and the lattice deformation . during the entire time evolution process the geometrical distortion curve and charge distribution shape for the polaron defect always stay well coupled and show no dispersion under low external electric fields , implying that the polaron defect is an inherent feature and the fundamental charge carrier in conducting polymer .",
    "the dependence of the stationary velocity of a polaron @xmath40 on the external electric field strength is also studied , and an ohmic region where @xmath40 increases linearly with the field strength is found .",
    "values beyond the speed of sound are achievable .",
    "this ohmic region extends approximately from 3 mv/@xmath1 to 9 mv/@xmath1 for the case of @xmath3=2.0 ev and @xmath4=1.0 ev . below 3 mv/@xmath1 the polaron velocity increases nonlinearly and in high external electric field strengths the polaron will become unstable and dissociate .",
    "our calculated threshold field strength for polaron dissociation is around 10 mv/@xmath1 for the case of @xmath3=2.0 ev and @xmath4=1.0 ev .",
    "it is in good agreement with experimental results and more physically intuitive than previous ssh calculations which take no electron - electron interactions into account .    the influence of electron - electron interactions ( both the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath3 and the nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath4 ) on polaron transport are investigated in detail . in general",
