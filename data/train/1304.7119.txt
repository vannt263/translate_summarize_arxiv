    "the planck satellite experiment has recently provided new and precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , covering a wide range of angular scales up to multipole @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the new data are in full agreement with the expectations of the so - called standard @xmath7cdm scenario .",
    "there exist however some tensions when the value of a number of cosmological parameters , as measured by planck data , are compared with the values of the same parameters as measured by independent cosmological probes .",
    "the most notable case concerns the constraint on the hubble constant @xmath8 .",
    "the value measured by the planck team , @xmath9 km / s / mpc ( at @xmath1 c.l . ) , is significantly lower than the previous measurement of @xmath10 km / s / mpc ( at @xmath1 c.l . ) from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) arising from optical and infrared observations of @xmath11 cepheid variables  @xcite .",
    "while systematics can certainly be present in both measurements , it is timely to investigate if this discrepancy can be explained by the inclusion of new physical phenomena .",
    "very recently , marra et al .",
    "@xcite , have pointed out that the hst value could be affected by the cosmic variance of the local expansion rate and inhomogeneities . in this approach ,",
    "the hst value is therefore biased and the correct value is given by planck measurements .    on the other hand",
    ", one has to consider that the cmb determination of the hubble parameter is not a direct measurement but it is based on the assumption of an underlying theoretical model .",
    "for example , the inclusion in the planck data analysis of an extra relativistic energy component , parameterized via the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath12 , changes the constraint on the hubble constant to @xmath13 km / s / mpc at @xmath14 c.l .",
    "@xcite , totally compatible with the hst determination .",
    "several physical candidates have been recently examined to account for the extra dark radiation component ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a combined planck and hst data analysis yields evidence for dark radiation at more than @xmath15 c.l .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility that the solution of the planck - hst tension could arise from an interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the assumption of a coupled dark energy model can change significantly the cmb constraints on the hubble parameter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , if coupled models are fitted to a ( wrong ) @xmath7cdm cosmology , the reconstructed @xmath8 from cmb will be shifted from its real value  @xcite . a mismatch between low and high redshift @xmath8 measurements",
    "could therefore be a smoking gun for an interaction in the dark sector .",
    "moreover , even if a cosmological constant @xmath7 is a good fit to the current data , the dark matter - dark energy interaction alleviates the well - known coincidence problem that plagues the @xmath7cdm scenario ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several candidates for coupled dark energy models have been proposed and investigated ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since coupled quintessence models can resemble to scalar - tensor or brans dicke gravitational theories , it has been suggested that coupled dark energy can also hint to a modification of general relativity on cosmological scales ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theories ] we briefly present the coupled dark energy model we consider for our analysis , in sec .  [",
    "sec : analysis ] we describe the analysis method , in sec .  [ sec : constraints ] we show our results and in section[sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume a flat universe described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric .",
    "we parametrize the interaction as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energy - momentum tensors for the dark matter and dark energy components respectively , @xmath19 is the dark matter four - velocity and the coefficient @xmath20 encodes the interaction rate between the two dark components .    in particular we restrict the parametrization to the case where the interaction rate is proportional to the dark energy density @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath23 ( the dot indicates derivative respect to conformal time @xmath24 ) .",
    "such an interacting model is in agreement with cosmological constraints and it does not suffer from early time instabilities if the coupling @xmath3 is negative and the dark energy equation of state @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we shall follow here the former stability conditions .",
    "the background evolution equations in the coupled model considered here read  @xcite @xmath27 in the synchronous gauge , the evolution of the dark matter and dark energy perturbations in the linear regime reads  @xcite @xmath28-\\xi \\left(\\frac{k v_t}{3}+\\frac{\\dot h}{6}\\right ) \\,,\\\\ \\label{eq : thetames }   \\dot v_{dm }   & = & -{\\mathcal h } v_{dm } \\,,\\\\",

    "the dark interaction we consider affects the cmb temperature spectrum in several ways . in fig .",
    "[ figspectra ] , we illustrate the impact of @xmath3 up to multipole @xmath35 for @xmath36 assuming a cold dark matter density @xmath37 and @xmath38 km / s / mpc . notice that the presence of a coupling among the dark matter and the dark energy fluids shifts the position of the peaks to larger multipoles . at low multipoles",
    ", a value of @xmath3 different from zero contributes to the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , while at high multipoles changes the amplitude of the gravitational lensing .",
    "cdm case and in the coupled cases for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 km / s / mpc .",
    "the main effects of the coupling are shifting the position of the acoustic peaks and varying their amplitude.,width=340 ]",
    "the theoretical cmb angular spectra are computed with a modified version of the camb code @xcite , in which we have included the background and linear density perturbation equations in the presence of a coupling between the dark matter and the dark energy sectors .",

    "in this paper we have presented novel cosmological constraints on a dark matter - dark energy interaction from the new cmb measurements provided by the planck experiment .",
    "we have found that a dark coupling interaction is compatible with planck data and that the coupling parameter @xmath3 is weakly constrained by planck measurements @xmath0 .",
    "however , the inclusion of a dark coupling opens up new degeneracies and affects strongly the constraints on the remaining cosmological parameters .",
    "the model with the dark interaction gives a lower matter density @xmath39 and a larger hubble parameter @xmath40 .",
    "since the value of the hubble constant is compatible with the hst value , we have combined the planck and hst data sets , finding that , in this case , a non - zero value of the dark coupling is suggested by the data , with @xmath4 at @xmath5 c.l .. the analysis presented here points out that an interaction in the dark sector is not only allowed by current cmb data but can even resolve the tension between the planck and the hst measurements of the hubble parameter .",
    "the results we have found are in agreement with the results obtained in former analyses for similar models using previous cosmological data @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank eleonora di valentino , martina gerbino and najla said for useful discussions and help .",
    "@xcite , the evolution equations for the coupled dark matter dark energy model considered here were studied in a gauge invariant way .",
    "it was demonstrated that , assuming adiabatic initial conditions for all the standard cosmological fluids ( photon , baryons , ... ) , the coupled dark energy fluid also obeys adiabatic initial conditions , see also ref .",
    "@xcite in the uncoupled case and ref .",
    "@xcite for another coupled example . at leading order in @xmath41",
    ", in the synchronous gauge , the initial conditions read : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the initial conditions for the photon density perturbations and @xmath44 is the equation of state of the photon .",
