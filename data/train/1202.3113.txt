    "if @xmath9 is a strictly increasing sequence , we say that @xmath10 is a _ recurrence set _ ( or a _ birkhoff set _ ) if for any dynamical system @xmath11 and any @xmath12 there exists a point @xmath13 and a @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 times ) denotes the @xmath18 iterate of @xmath8 . in the measure theoretic",
    "setting recurrence sets , which are often called _",
    "poincar sets _ in this context , are defined in this way : @xmath10 is a recurrence set if for any probability space @xmath19 and any measure - preserving transformation @xmath20 of @xmath21 , there exists for any set @xmath22 with @xmath23 and a @xmath14 such that @xmath24 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that any poincar set is a birkhoff set : indeed if @xmath10 is not a birkhoff set , let @xmath5 be a dynamical system such that for some @xmath25 , @xmath26 for any @xmath14 and any @xmath13 . without loss of generality , @xmath5 can be supposed to be a minimal system , and hence there exists a probability measure @xmath27 on @xmath21 whose support is @xmath21 and which is invariant by @xmath8 .",
    "there exists then a non - empty open set @xmath28 in @xmath21 such that @xmath29 for any @xmath14 . as @xmath30",
    ", it follows that @xmath10 is not a poincar set .",
    "the converse assertion is not true : there are birkhoff sets which are not poincar sets @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "recurrence is a central topic in the study of dynamical systems , and we refer the reader to one of the classical books @xcite or @xcite for the basic facts , and to the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for a deeper study of various recurrence properties , as well as their applications to number theory and combinatorics .    in the rest of the paper , we say that @xmath10 is _ a recurrence set for the dynamical system _",

    "standard examples of recurrence sets ( besides the obvious example of the set @xmath34 ) are the set of squares @xmath35 , or more generally the sets of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a polynomial taking integer values on integers with @xmath38 , difference sets @xmath39 where @xmath40 is any infinite set in @xmath41 , thick sets ( i.e. sets containing arbitrarily long intervals ) , the sets @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the set of primes , or more generally the so called van der corput ( vdc ) sets .",
    "see , for instance @xcite or @xcite for more information on vdc sets .",
    "some generalized polynomials also yield recurrence sets , see @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this paper is an old problem in combinatorial number theory which is to know whether any difference set @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a subset of @xmath47 with bounded gaps , must contain a bohr neighborhood of zero .",
    "it is known by a result of veech @xcite that this is true up to a set of density zero , but it is not known whether this set can be dispensed with .",
    "it is shown by glasner in @xcite and boshernitzan and glasner in @xcite ( see also the papers @xcite by glasner and weiss and @xcite by weiss ) that this problem is equivalent to the following question concerning recurrence sets :    @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite [ q2 ] if @xmath10 is a recurrence set for all finite products of circle rotations , is it a recurrence set ?",
    "question [ q2 ] was studied in several papers , for instance in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( where an equivalent formulation in terms of cayley numbers of graphs is given ) . sets which are recurrent for all finite products of circle rotations are called _",
    "bohr sets_. if @xmath1 is a positive integer , a set which is recurrent for all products of @xmath1 rotations on @xmath48 is called _ @xmath1-bohr_. in view of question [ q2 ] , it comes as a natural problem to ask whether an @xmath1-bohr set is necessarily a bohr set .",
    "it was shown by katznelson in @xcite that it is not the case .",
    "more precisely , the following result was proved in @xcite :    [ thkatz]@xcite let @xmath2 . for each @xmath3-tuple @xmath49 of elements of @xmath0 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xmath53-independent , and for each @xmath54 ,",
    "the set @xmath55 is an @xmath1-bohr set which is not @xmath3-bohr .",
    "the sets @xmath56 are `` large '' sets in the sense that they have positive density .",
    "it is possible to obtain from theorem [ thkatz ] many bohr sets : given a sequence @xmath57 of numbers in @xmath58 and families @xmath59 , the set @xmath60 is obviously a bohr set .",
    "however , it is clear that the set @xmath40 is a poincar set : for each @xmath2 , the @xmath3-tuple @xmath61 is @xmath53-independent in the sense of theorem [ thkatz ] , and thus the set @xmath62 contains , for some @xmath63 , the integers @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that for any measure - preserving transformation  @xmath20 of a probability space @xmath65 , any set @xmath33 which is such that @xmath66 for each @xmath67 is such that @xmath68 .",
    "the appearance of such sequences @xmath69 comes from the particular structure of the sets @xmath62 , and it is natural to wonder whether it is possible to construct other kinds of @xmath1-bohr sets which are not bohr , which would have a different arithmetical structure and come closer to a potential counterexample to question [ q2 ] .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide an alternative construction of @xmath1-bohr sets which are not bohr , which has the advantage over the construction of @xcite to be both very flexible and completely explicit .",
    "our main result can be stated as follows :    [ th2 ] for each @xmath70 there exist sets @xmath71 of integers which are @xmath1-bohr but not @xmath72-bohr , and which have the following simple structure :    @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a rapidly growing sequence of integers , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are sequences of integers depending from @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a very rapidly increasing sequence of integers independent from all the other parameters .",
    "the arithmetic structure of these sets @xmath71 is very explicit , and one can construct from them many examples of bohr sets .",
    "but contrary to the sets from @xcite , it is for most choices of parameters in the construction not clear whether these sets are recurrent sets or not .",
    "so our construction does not solve question [ q2 ] , but highlights how delicate this question is .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section @xmath82 is devoted to the proof of theorem [ th2 ] in the case where @xmath83 ( here it is completely elementary ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th2 ] for general @xmath1 is the object of sections @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "lastly , we construct in section @xmath86 some bohr sets obtained from theorem [ th2 ] , and present some final comments and remarks .    in the whole paper",
    "we will denote by @xmath87 the rotation on @xmath0 associated to @xmath88 .",
    "let us begin by recalling what we want to prove : we are looking for a set @xmath89 of the form given in theorem [ th2 ] which is recurrent for all circle rotations , i.e. such that    for any @xmath90 , any @xmath91 , there exists a @xmath92 such that @xmath93    but which is not recurrent for all products of two circle rotations , i.e. for which there exist @xmath94 and @xmath95 such that    for any @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we will use the following notation @xmath98 we will denote by @xmath99 the integer part of the real number @xmath100 , and by @xmath101 its distance to @xmath4 . we will also need the following simple fact :    [ lem1bis ] there exist two universal constants @xmath102 such that for any @xmath103 and @xmath104 , for any @xmath105 , the following holds true :    if @xmath106 , then for any @xmath107 there exists an integer @xmath37 with @xmath108 such that @xmath109 .",

    "since @xmath117 , the fractional parts of the @xmath118 numbers @xmath119 form a @xmath100-net of @xmath58 : for any @xmath120 there exists a @xmath37 with @xmath121 such that @xmath122 .",
    "hence @xmath123 and this proves lemma [ lem1bis ] with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the key lemma for the proof of theorem [ th2 ] in the @xmath126-dimensional case is the following :    [ lem1 ] for any @xmath91 there exist two positive integers @xmath127 such that for any @xmath90 , any integers @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and any @xmath130 , one of the following two assertions is true : either @xmath131    or @xmath132    we will apply lemma [ lem1 ] with two values of @xmath46 only : @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in the first case",
    "the set of integers appearing in ( [ eq1 ] ) is simply a shifted arithmetic progression of step @xmath135 , and in the second case the set we get a multiple of a shifted arithmetic progression of step @xmath136 .",
    "the idea of the proof can be summarized as follows : define an integer @xmath137 as @xmath138",
    ". if @xmath139 is not too close to @xmath126 for some @xmath140 , then by lemma [ lem1bis ] any @xmath105 ( in particular @xmath141 ) can be @xmath142-approximated by a power of @xmath143 which is not too large , and ( [ eq1 ] ) is true .",
    "if @xmath139 is too close to @xmath126 for each @xmath140 , then ( [ eq2 ] ) holds true .",

    "there are two cases to consider .",

    "lemma [ lem1 ] is proved .",
    "[ rem00 ] let us record here for further use the expression of @xmath162 and @xmath163 which we obtained in the proof of lemma [ lem1 ] : @xmath164 observe that @xmath163 is much larger than @xmath162 and that given any integer @xmath165 , one can ensure by taking @xmath166 sufficiently small that @xmath167 divides @xmath162 .",
    "we are now ready for the proof of theorem [ th2 ] for @xmath83 .",
    "we construct two sets @xmath168 and @xmath169 by induction on @xmath170 and by blocks , applying repeatedly lemma [ lem1 ] .",
    "we start by taking at the first step @xmath171 .",
    "lemma [ lem1 ] gives us a @xmath172 and a @xmath173 , then we choose @xmath174 , @xmath175 , a large even number @xmath176 , and we take for the first @xmath172 elements of the set @xmath168 the numbers @xmath177 which are all odd . for the first element of the set",
    "@xmath169 we take the number @xmath178 , which is even",
    ". then we take @xmath179 , obtain @xmath180 and @xmath181 , then take @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 very large and even ( much larger than @xmath185 in particular ) .",
    "we continue the set @xmath168 with the numbers @xmath186 and we take for the second element of the set @xmath169 the number @xmath187 .",
    "we continue in this fashion : @xmath188 and @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 result from the application of lemma [ lem1 ] to @xmath192 , where @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and the sequence @xmath195 consists of even numbers and increases very rapidly .",
    "observe that these two sets are disjoint , since all the elements in the first set are odd while all elements in the second set are even , and that @xmath190 is much smaller than @xmath196 by remark [ rem00 ] , so that the set @xmath197 looks like this : @xmath198 now by lemma [ lem1 ] , it is clear that for all @xmath90 and all @xmath199 there exists a @xmath92 such that @xmath200 , so @xmath89 is a recurrence set for any rotation of @xmath0 .    it remains to find @xmath94 such that @xmath89 is not recurrent for @xmath201 , and this is not difficult thanks to the particular structure of the set @xmath89 .",
    "we will need the following lemma , which is implicit in @xcite :    [ lem2 ] there exists a positive constant @xmath202 such that if @xmath203 is any sequence of integers such that @xmath204 for all @xmath205 , there exist uncountably many @xmath90 such that for all @xmath206 , @xmath207 moreover , the set of such @xmath208 s is @xmath209-dense in @xmath0 . in particular",
    "if @xmath210 , there exists an element @xmath90 with @xmath211 such that @xmath212 tends to @xmath126 at the rate @xmath213 .    for completeness s sake",
    "we provide a short proof of lemma [ lem2 ] .",
    "for any @xmath206 , let @xmath214 be the set @xmath215\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the set @xmath214 is the union of a collection of disjoint closed sub - arcs of @xmath0 of length @xmath216 .",
    "we write this collection as @xmath217 .",
    "the distance between two consecutive such sub - arcs is equal to @xmath218 .",
    "so any arc @xmath219 of @xmath0 of length greater than @xmath220 contains two arcs of the collection @xmath217 .",
    "now observe that @xmath221 , because @xmath222 .",
    "it follows that any arc @xmath223 contains two disjoint arcs of the collection @xmath224 , and in this way we construct a cantor - type subset @xmath225 of @xmath58 such that for all @xmath92 and all @xmath226 , @xmath227 .",
    "so any @xmath228 with @xmath226 satisfies @xmath229 since any subarc of the set @xmath230 contains a @xmath231 with @xmath232 , the set of such @xmath208 s is @xmath233-dense in @xmath0 , so it is @xmath209-dense in @xmath0 .",
    "lemma [ lem2 ] is proved with @xmath234 .",
    "let us now go back to the proof .",
    "the crucial observation is that the sequence @xmath235 may be chosen as rapidly growing as we want to .",
    "let @xmath236 , given by lemma [ lem2 ] , be such that @xmath237 and for all @xmath199 , @xmath238 then for any @xmath239 we have @xmath240",
    "if @xmath241 and @xmath242 is sufficiently large with respect to  @xmath196 and @xmath243 , we can ensure that @xmath244 for all @xmath199 and @xmath239 , i.e. that @xmath245 . now @xmath246 .",
    "hence we get that @xmath247 for all @xmath92 .",
    "the argument for the construction of @xmath248 is exactly similar : lemma [ lem2 ] gives us a @xmath248 such that @xmath249 and @xmath250 for all @xmath199 , and so @xmath251 .",
    "hence @xmath252 for all @xmath92 . putting things together we get that for all @xmath92 , @xmath253 which is exactly what we wanted to prove .",
    "an easy modification of the proof shows that we can replace the bound @xmath254 above by any @xmath255 as close as we want to @xmath82 ( it suffices to take @xmath256 extremely large and to replace the quantities @xmath257 in the estimates above by @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is some suitably large integer ) : for any @xmath255 there exists a set @xmath89 which is recurrent for all rotations , but such that there exist @xmath94 such that @xmath260 for all @xmath92 .",
    "[ rem1 ] we did not use the parameter @xmath136 nor the parameter @xmath46 of lemma [ lem1 ] in this construction , but they will be necessary later on in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "lemma [ lem1 ] also gives us other examples of sequences which are recurrent for all rotations , but not recurrent for some product of two rotations .",
    "for instance the proof would work as well if we considered for @xmath168 and @xmath169 the sets @xmath261 ( @xmath262 and @xmath263 ) or @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a rapidly increasing sequence .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th2 ] uses induction on @xmath266 and the same kind of ideas , but becomes more involved as the dimension grows . in order to make the underlying ideas of the induction clear",
    ", we will present the @xmath82-dimensional case first .",
    "the first difficulty one encounters when trying to go from the @xmath126-dimensional to the @xmath82-dimensional case is that one needs a multi - dimensional analogue of the following fact , which is the crux of the proof of lemma [ lem1 ] : if @xmath267 , then the numbers @xmath268 where @xmath269 form a @xmath270-net of the unit circle , and an important point is the dependence of @xmath37 from @xmath271 . in the multi - dimensional case , we will use a weak form of the following result of kannan and lovasz @xcite :    [ th0ter ] let @xmath272 be an @xmath1-tuple of real numbers , and @xmath104 .",
    "suppose that @xmath273 is an integer such that for any @xmath1-tuple @xmath274 of elements of @xmath4 , which are not all zero , the following inequality holds @xmath275 where @xmath276 is some positive universal constant .",
    "then for all @xmath277 there exist @xmath278 and @xmath279 with @xmath280 such that @xmath281 ) quantifies `` how independent '' the reals @xmath272 are , and the size of the bound @xmath273 depends from @xmath142 and from this rate of independence .",
    "recall that @xmath282 denotes the distance of the real number @xmath283 to @xmath4 .",
    "theorem [ th0ter ] has the following consequence ( we disregard the particular expression of the bound @xmath284 , which is actually an important issue in @xcite ) :    [ cor0 ] for each @xmath2 there exists a positive constant @xmath285 such that the following statement holds true for any @xmath286 : if @xmath104 and @xmath287 , with @xmath273 an integer , are such that for any @xmath288 @xmath289 then for any @xmath290 there exists a @xmath291 with @xmath292 such that @xmath293 which will be needed in the rest of the proof .",

    ", we obtain :    [ cor11 ] let @xmath402 be a sequence of positive numbers going to zero as @xmath170 goes to infinity . there exist three sequences of integers @xmath403 , @xmath404 and @xmath405 such that if @xmath406 is any sequence of integers , there exists a sequence @xmath407 of integers such that for any sequence of integers @xmath408 , the union @xmath409 of the three sets @xmath410 where @xmath411 is a @xmath82-bohr set .    in order to finish the proof , it remains to show that if the two sequences @xmath406 and @xmath408 are well - chosen , there exist @xmath412 such that for all @xmath92 @xmath413 the construction of @xmath414 is done exactly as in the proof of the @xmath126-dimensional case , using the fact that @xmath415 can be chosen much larger than @xmath416 .",
    "the construction of @xmath248 is also the same : whatever the choices of the integers @xmath296 , we can get @xmath417 with @xmath418 for all @xmath170 if the sequence @xmath419 grows sufficiently fast . in order to construct @xmath420 , we apply lemma [ lem2 ] to the sequence @xmath421 defined by @xmath422 and @xmath423 : if we start from @xmath256 very large there exists @xmath424 very close to @xmath425 , such that for all @xmath170 @xmath426 if @xmath427 is sufficiently large , and @xmath428 then for all @xmath429 with @xmath430 , we have @xmath431 if @xmath415 is large enough .",

    "it follows that for all @xmath575 and all @xmath582 , @xmath583 if for each @xmath575 we take @xmath427 very large , and then choose @xmath415 very large with respect to  @xmath427 and @xmath584 , we can ensure for instance that @xmath585 .",

    "we have thus exhibited a product of @xmath567 rotations for which @xmath71 is not a recurrence set .",
    "theorem [ th2 ] is proved .",
    "[ remrem ] inspection of the proof of theorem [ th2 ] shows that the same phenomenon appears for general @xmath1 as for @xmath83 : the sets @xmath587 , @xmath588 are by construction intertwined , and they can not be forced far away one from another . indeed , for any @xmath91 , let us write @xmath589 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 as @xmath590 , @xmath591 and @xmath592 in order to indicate their dependance from @xmath142 .",
    "it follows from the proofs of lemma [ lem1 ] and [ lem3 ] that @xmath590 divides @xmath591 , that @xmath593 is much larger than @xmath591 , and that if @xmath594 is much smaller than @xmath142 , @xmath591 divides @xmath595 . also , the proof of lemma [ lem1 ] yields that @xmath596 , where @xmath321 is much smaller than @xmath166 .",
    "so if @xmath597 is an integer , and if we take @xmath321 small enough , it follows from remark [ rem00 ] that we can ensure that @xmath598 is divisible with @xmath202 .",
    "looking more closely at the expressions of @xmath599 in the proof of lemma [ prop0 ] , we see that @xmath600 for @xmath531 , where @xmath300 is extremely small .",
    "now @xmath475 is small , but only compared to @xmath476 , and if we take @xmath300 small enough we can ensure that @xmath601 is divisible with any of the numbers @xmath602 , where @xmath603 runs over all subsets of @xmath604 .",
    "it follows from this observation that given two distinct subsets @xmath605 and @xmath606 of @xmath607 , one of the two integers @xmath608 and @xmath609 is always divisible with the other . as @xmath610 is very large compared to all the numbers @xmath611 , the two arithmetic progressions @xmath612 and @xmath613",
    "are necessarily intertwined .",
    "lastly , since @xmath451 is much larger than any integer @xmath614 , these arithmetic progressions are also intertwined with the set @xmath615 .",
    "let @xmath616 be an increasing sequence of integers , and @xmath617 a sequence of positive real numbers going to @xmath618 as @xmath1 goes to infinity .",

    "for all @xmath2 and @xmath625 , we can consider for @xmath626 the @xmath627-tuple @xmath628 .",
    "we know from theorem [ th10 ] that there exists a @xmath629 such that @xmath630 and so we see that the set @xmath89 is a bohr set .",
    "moreover it is not difficult to see from the construction that if @xmath631 is any sequence of integers , the sets @xmath632 are also @xmath1-bohr provided @xmath633 is sufficiently large for each @xmath2 .",
    "hence @xmath620 is a bohr set as well in this case .",
    "all these sets @xmath89 are `` small '' ( in particular they have density zero ) , and , more importantly , they have a very explicit arithmetical structure .",
    "we do not know whether @xmath89 can be non - recurrent for some suitable choice of the parameters in the construction , but we do know that , for some particular choices , @xmath89 is a recurrence set , and even a poincar set .",
    "this leaves the following question open to further investigation :        we have seen that each one of the sets @xmath71 constructed in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] is not recurrent for some product of @xmath567 rotations .",
    "these are very specific dynamical systems , and one can wonder whether there are other `` natural '' dynamical systems which would be non - recurrent with respect to  @xmath71 . in particular in a recent work @xcite bergelson , del junco , lemaczyk and rosenblatt initiated the study of sets which are non - recurrent in the measure - theoretic sense for weakly mixing dynamical systems .",
    "thus the question naturally arises : is it possible to find an @xmath1-bohr set which would be non - recurrent ( in the measure - theoretic sense ) for some weakly mixing dynamical system ?",
    "such @xmath1-bohr sets would necessarily have density zero , so that the examples of @xcite can not have this property .",
