    "observations show that the occurrence of this phenomenon and its main characteristics essentially depend on the mixture composition and the physical conditions of combustion  boundary conditions at the tube ends ( it can be open , semi - open or closed ) , location of the ignition point , tube wall roughness , presence of acoustic fields , and so on .",
    "although precise conditions leading to the flame acceleration have not been identified yet , it is generally agreed that importance of each of the above factors is determined by the extent to which it perturbs the flame .",
    "this view is naturally based on the fact that flame perturbations increase the flame front area , and hence the overall gas consumption rate . in the studies of deflagration - to - detonation transitions , for instance",
    ", mixture is usually ignited near the closed end of a tube with roughed walls and/or equipped with a series of restricting rings.@xcite because of the high irregularity of flame movement under such conditions , no quantitative description of this _ stimulated _ flame acceleration exists , though its mechanism is qualitatively understood fairly well .     curve are the basis points used to construct an approximating polynomial ( sec .

    "acceleration , though also known well , is understood much less.@xcite historically , it was discovered and studied@xcite earlier than the stimulated flame acceleration , as it exists in most mixtures burned in tubes open at both ends .",
    "unlike its counterpart , spontaneous acceleration is a quite regular phenomenon , in that it takes place in laminar regimes of flame propagation .",
    "moreover , experiments demonstrate reproducible flame behavior during acceleration which is determined by the tube size and mixture composition .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows experimental plots of the flame position as a function of time for flames propagating in an open tube @xmath0 cm in diameter and @xmath0 m long , for various methane - air mixtures.@xcite a striking evidence contained in the figure is the difference in the values of flame acceleration in different mixtures . even without detailed analysis ,",
    "it is clear that the rate of change of the tangent to the flame trajectory in the stoichiometric mixture ( @xmath1 methane ) is much higher than that in the lean mixtures .",
    "moreover , a certain grouping of curves is evident : trajectories in mixtures @xmath2 to @xmath1 are quite similar , and are clearly separated from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 curves .",
    "the following reasoning makes the apparent peculiarity of these observations more concrete .",
    "dynamics of flames under consideration is controlled by gravity : the dimensionless gravitational acceleration , @xmath5 exceeds unity for any methane concentration .",
    "the conclusion commonly made in this case is that the flame propagation speed is independent of the normal flame speed ( for instance , this premise is the basis of the `` bubble '' models@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it would be natural to expect universal behavior of all flames , in particular , similarity of flame acceleration , whatever specific mechanism of flame movement .",
    "we have just seen , however , that this contradicts observations .",
    "one might think that the observed differences could be ascribed to the differences in thermal expansion of gases , but invoking numerics readily rules out this possibility . to be specific , the gas expansion coefficients of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 mixtures differ by about @xmath6 percent , and this is also true of the @xmath2 and @xmath7 mixtures , but is clearly incompatible with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    even in tubes of such a moderate diameter as @xmath0 cm",
    ", the speed of flame propagation largely exceeds the normal speed , and significantly increases as the result of acceleration .",
    "for instance , the normal flame speed in a @xmath2 mixture is @xmath8cm / s , whereas its propagation speed in the @xmath0 m long tube is initially about @xmath9cm / s , increasing eventually to @xmath10cm / s .",
    "this means that spontaneous flame acceleration is a highly nonlinear process : the nonlinearity of gasdynamic equations describing the gas flows induced by the propagating flame in no approximation can be considered weak .",
    "this is why until quite recently this process had been beyond the reach of theoretical analysis ( evidently , the conventional methods based on explicit solving of the flow equations are useless in problems of this sort ) .",
    "things changed with the invention of the on - shell description of flames.@xcite this description will be used below to study the phenomenon of spontaneous flame acceleration in open horizontal tubes",
    ". it will be shown that the resolution of the above - mentioned peculiarity is in the existence of two distinct regimes of flame propagation , characterized by significantly different acceleration .",
    "the existence of two different regimes was first established in the study@xcite of the uniform flame movement in horizontal tubes ( observed experimentally in semi - open tubes when the mixture is ignited near the open end ) , where it was noticed that they also differ regarding flame response to the heat losses : flames propagating in the slower type  i regime decelerate when the losses increase , while the faster type  ii flames accelerate .",
    "it turns out that things are similar in tubes open at both ends : the two types of flames , identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , respond differently to the energy losses associated with the cold gas movement allowed by unflanging the tube , though now acceleration is positive in both regimes .    in view of the equivalence of gravity and translatory acceleration ,",

    "this apparent discordance can be explained as follows .",
    "let us find the average flame speed over the initial section of the tube . as the paper gives only records for the fastest flames ( @xmath285 methane ) , it will suffice to determine the average speed in a @xmath265 mixture . since the tube diameter @xmath286 cm is considerably larger than in the cases studied before , let us first check if the wall friction is still negligible .",

    "m/s @xmath289 m/s , and hence @xmath290 indicating turbulent flow conditions .",
    "the corresponding friction coefficient @xmath291 is significantly larger than it would be in a laminar flow . yet ,",
    "substitution into ( [ nofriction ] ) yields @xmath292 a condition which fairly holds at distances of a few meters , and where the theory gives @xmath293cm",

    "thus , the average flame speed over the distance @xmath295 m is @xmath296 m/s .",
    "barring the wall friction that might become noticeable at the end of this distance , the error of this calculation is @xmath297 on the other hand , the experiment gives @xmath298 m/s for the flame speed in the initial tube section , and @xmath299 m/s for the speed of uniform flame movement .",
    "thus , it appears likely that the small flame acceleration was not experimentally resolved ( probably because of the increased screen - wire spacing ) , and what was specified as the constant speed of the flame was actually its speed averaged over the initial section of the tube .",
    "the analysis carried out above leads us to the conclusion that in long open tubes with smooth walls , most of the flame travel proceeds in the quasi - steady regime , the difference of gas dynamic pressure at the tube ends being the reason of flame acceleration .",
    "two essentially different regimes of quasi - steady flame propagation generally exist : in the type  i regime realized in mixtures close to the limits of inflammability , the flame speed and its acceleration are significantly lower than in the type  ii regime obeyed by the near - stoichiometric flames ( the ratio of flame acceleration in the two regimes ranges from about @xmath161 at the early stage to about @xmath6 near the endpoint of the type  ii spectrum ) .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "[ rapidac ] suggest that in between of these two extremes ( in transient mixtures ) , flames begin their propagation in the type  i regime , and then undergo a transition to the type  ii regime ( as in the case of @xmath2 mixture ) .",
    "this observation seems to find experimental confirmation in the following excerpt from ref .",
    "@xcite : `` in most of the experiments slight vibrations were noticed at different stages in the development of the propagation , the incidence of these vibrations being earlier the more rapid was the flame . ''",
    "as these vibrations are evidently not of the acoustic origin ( the vibratory movement due to the flame - acoustic interaction , once set in , continues with growing amplitude till the end of the flame travel ) , they presumably are a sign of the mentioned transitions between the two propagation regimes .",
    "it is to be noted in this connection that the termination of the type  ii spectrum also must be observed as a spontaneous flame disturbance ( if the flame propagates in the type  ii regime ) .",
    "the spectrum terminates in the second half of the tube , at a distance increasing with the normal flame speed ( cf .",
    "[ rapidac ] ) .    as to the distance where transition from type  i to type  ii regime of flame propagation takes place ,",
    "this is a question of their relative stability , so that only general statements can be made in advance of a detailed stability analysis .",
    "it was argued in part  i that in the case of uniform flame movement , the relevant dimensionless number is @xmath300 ( with @xmath301 the fresh gas viscosity ) , a change of the flame type occurring at @xmath302 opening the tube adds a new dimensional parameter  the tube length .",

    "we conclude that the larger the normal flame speed , the closer to the ignition point it undergoes a transition from type  i to type  ii regime of propagation .",

    "[ rapidac ] .    next ,",
    "several technical remarks are in order .",
    "the first concerns dependence of the solutions on the gravity acceleration .",
    "as discussed in part  i , each type of solutions describing uniform flame movement obeys a simple scaling law with respect to the dimensionless parameter @xmath320 namely , @xmath321",
    "@xmath322 @xmath323 in other words , obtained in the leading order of the large - slope expansion , these solutions represent at the same time the large-@xmath324 asymptotics of the exact solutions .",
    "this is no longer so in open tubes .",
    "while eq .",
    "( [ masteru ] ) suggests that the flame acceleration ought to scale as @xmath325 eq .",
    "( [ aurel ] ) shows that @xmath326 ( barring the small @xmath49-dependent terms in the denominator ) , because @xmath327 thus , the large-@xmath324 asymptotic does not exist in this case . since @xmath328m / s@xmath230 , this implies that the large-@xmath28 or small-@xmath19 asymptotics neither exist .",
    "the latter means in turn that the phenomenon of flame acceleration in open horizontal tubes in no way can be described within the bubble model ( @xmath329 ) .",
    "second , regarding the termination point of the type  ii regime , it should be emphasized that the existence of this point is an intrinsic property of the type  ii solutions , which is unrelated to either the singularity at @xmath330 of the function @xmath107 given by eq .",

    "this feature provides a mechanism for further increase of flame acceleration , in the following way .",
    "it is natural to expect that the flame unsteadiness occurring beyond the spectrum endpoint will increase the front curvature , and hence effectively the normal flame speed . since the increase of the normal flame speed shifts the spectrum endpoint towards the cold tube end",
    ", the flame will travel for some distance more as a type  ii flame obtained from the true flame by averaging over the unsteady disturbance , and which propagates with the increased normal speed and hence , increased acceleration .",
    "this qualitative description becomes rigorous when the characteristic length of the flame disturbance is much smaller than the tube diameter ( cf .",
    "iii of part  i ) .    finally , to complete the portraits of the two types of flames , it is to be added that they are also notably distinct regarding the value of the kinetic energy losses taking place in the dissipation domain and accompanying homogenization of the burnt gas flow .",
    "the rate of this process is given by eq .",
    "( [ keloss ] ) .",
    "numerical results show that this rate in the type  ii regime is 12 orders of magnitude larger than that in the type  i regime .",
    "moreover , the directions of its change in the two cases are opposite : the dissipation rate in the flow generated by a type  ii flame appreciably increases as it travels along the tube , and somewhat decreases for a type  i flame .",
    "the lack of consistent quantitative description of flame acceleration is the reason why the two different phenomena ",
    "flame acceleration in smooth tubes and in tubes with restrictions  often appear in the literature under the same term `` spontaneous acceleration . ''",
    "according to the general use of this term as indication to an intrinsic property , it is to be reserved for flame acceleration in smooth tubes .",
    "likewise , the term `` stimulated '' is appropriate in cases where flame acceleration is a result of perturbations caused by restricting rings _ etc .",
