    "<S> we discuss the effects of cp violating phases in supersymmetric theories on event rates in the scattering of neutralinos off nuclei in terrestrial detectors . </S>",
    "<S> such effects are negligible if the cp violating phases are small . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the stringent experimental constraints on the edm of the neutron@xcite and of the electron @xcite would seem to require either small cp violating phases@xcite or a heavy supersymmetric particle spectrum@xcite , in the range of several tev , to satisfy the experimental limits on the edms . </S>",
    "<S> however , a heavy sparticle spectrum also constitutes fine tuning@xcite and further a heavy spectrum in the range of several tev will put the supersymmetric particles beyond the reach of even the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> recently a new possibility was proposed@xcite , i.e. , that of internal cancellations among the various components contributing to the edms which allows for the existence of large cp violating phases , with a susy spectrum which is not excessively heavy and is thus accessible at colliders in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> cp violating phases o(1 ) are attractive because they circumvent the naturalness problem associated with small phases or a heavy susy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the edm analysis of ref.@xcite was for the minimal supergravity model which has only two cp violating phases . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of ref.@xcite was extended in ref.@xcite to take account of all allowed cp violating phases in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with no generational mixing . </S>",

    "<S> indeed a general numerical analysis bears this out@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> large cp violating phases can affect significantly dark matter analyses and other phenomena at low energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis in ref.@xcite shows that large cp violating phases consistent with the cosmological relic density constraints and the edm constraints using the cancellation mechanism are indeed possible . </S>",
    "<S> cp violating phases affect event rates in dark matter detectors and a partial analysis of these effects with two cp phases and without the edm constraint was given in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , currently there are no analyses where the effect of large cp violating phases on event rates and the simultaneous satisfaction of the edm constraints via the cancellation mechansim are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> further , the previous analyses are all limited to two cp violating phases while supergravity models with non - universalities and mssm can possess many more phases@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give the first complete analytic analysis of the effects of cp violation on event rates with the inclusion of all cp violating phases allowed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) when intergenerational mixings are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we then give a numerical analysis of the cp violating effects on event rates with the inclusion of the edm constraints . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that while the effects of cp violating phases on event rates are significant with the inclusion of the edm constraints , they are not enormous as for the case when the edm constraints are ignored .    </S>",
