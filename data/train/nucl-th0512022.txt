    "to discuss the problem of missing strength of gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions , one needs to study the distribution of transition strength over the excitation energy .",
    "a convenient tool for that purpose is the strength function of gt transitions @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy of the @xmath5 state reckoned from the ground state of a target nucleus , @xmath6 .",
    "usually , it is assumed that the effect of missing strength can be explained ( reproduced ) by including 2p2h admixtures into the wave functions of nuclear states involved . in order to check this assumption , we consider the energy - weighted moments of the gt strength function @xmath7 for positive integer @xmath8 . in the first section",
    ", we calculate the moments in the random phase approximation , the second random phase approximation and within the fragmentation problem . in the second section",
    ", we argue that the explanation of missing strength requires that the particle - hole residual interaction has a specific feature , it should intensively mix the @xmath9 and @xmath10 particle - hole configurations .",
    "the example of such an interaction is presented and the strength function of @xmath11 transitions in @xmath12 is demonstrated . in the third section ,",
    "the calculations of total muon capture rates by complex nuclei are discussed .",
    "the fourth section contains the analysis of spin - isospin transitions in @xmath13 nuclei observed in muon capture , and in @xmath14 and @xmath15 reactions .",
    "the main results are collected in conclusion .",
    "in this section we give in a compact form a summary of the basic equations for energy - weighted moments calculated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , the second random phase approximation ( srpa ) and within the fragmentation problem .",
    "the formulae are presented for double - magic nuclei ; the extension to the open shell nuclei is straightforward  one should replace the creation operators of particle - hole states by two - quasiparticle ones and the hartree - fock ground state by the state of quasiparticle vacuum .",
    "we use the labels @xmath16 , @xmath17 for the occupied single - particle states and the labels @xmath18 , @xmath19 for vacant ones .",
    "the @xmath20 is a slater determinant consisting of occupied states only . for a magic number system",
    "@xmath20 is the nondegenerated ground states in the model of independent particles .",
    "the phonon creation and destruction operators are defined by @xmath21 the phonon amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 are determined by the homogeneous system of linear equations : @xmath24 , a^{\\dag}_{p } a_{h } \\bigr ]       \\vert \\phi_{0 } \\rangle       &   = &   \\displaystyle    e_{\\alpha }    \\langle \\phi_0 \\vert       \\bigl [ o_{\\alpha } , a^{\\dag}_{p } a_{h } \\bigr ]        \\vert \\phi_{0 } \\rangle , \\cr   \\noalign{\\smallskip }   \\displaystyle    \\langle \\phi_{0 } \\vert      \\bigl [ [ o_{\\alpha } , h ] , a^{\\dag}_{h } a_{p } \\bigr ]       \\vert \\phi_{0 } \\rangle       & = &   \\displaystyle    e_{\\alpha }    \\langle \\phi_0 \\vert       \\bigl [ o_{\\alpha } , a^{\\dag}_{h } a_{p } \\bigr ]        \\vert \\phi_{0 } \\rangle .",

    "@xcite it follows that for the positive - definite matrix @xmath30 ( in this case @xmath31 is stable against particle - hole excitations ) the system ( [ eq : rpa_eigenproblem ] ) has only nonzero eigenvalues @xmath4 .",

    "@xcite , the definition of the phonon operators ( [ eq : rpa_phonon ] ) is extended by including the creation and destruction operators of the two - particle  two - hole excitations @xmath45 phonon amplitudes are determined by ( [ eq : eq_motion ] ) after replacing the rpa phonons by the srpa ones @xcite . from ( [ eq : eq_motion ] ) one obtains @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 the algebraic structure of the equations remains the same as in the rpa .",
    "this is true regarding the formal definition of the matrix elements of the transition operator @xmath33 , @xmath49 \\vert \\phi_{0 } \\rangle $ ] .",
    "the distinction is the appearance of srpa phonons instead of rpa phonons .",
    "the only nonvanishing matrix elements of any one - body transition operator are those between @xmath31 and the 1p1h excited states . as a consequence ,",
    "the zero energy - weighted moment reduces to @xmath50 ( the length of the vector @xmath51 minus the length of @xmath52 ) .",
    "this difference is the same in both the approximations , because it is determined by the space of particle - hole excitations only . for the gamow - teller transitions ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) the zero energy - weighted moment reduces to @xmath55 which is the value of the ikeda sum rule .",
    "the first energy - weighted moment calculated in the srpa is @xmath56 it coincides with the one obtained in the rpa .",
    "a similar situation appears within the fragmentation problem @xcite , where the ground state @xmath57 is assumed to be presented by some model wave function , and one studies the influence of the enlarging of the space excited states on the distribution of transition strength .",
    "the wave function of the excited state can be decomposed into some basis @xmath58 in this expression the set of basis vectors has been divided into two parts , according to the values of the matrix elements of the transition operator @xmath33 @xmath59 for example , if one used the hartree - fock ground state and the space of excited states spanned by the 1p1h and 2p2h basis vectors , the particle - hole components would belong to the first set and the two - particle  two - hole vectors would be ones of the second group for every one - body transition operator .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that in this problem the zero and first energy - weighted moments ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) are determined by the @xmath62-subspace of simple excited states only , and do not depend on the interaction between @xmath62- and more complicated @xmath63-states and on the interactions acting inside the @xmath63-subspace alone .",
    "this is a direct consequence of freezing the ground state .",
    "the zero and first energy - weighted moments are conserved when going from rpa to srpa @xmath64 and @xmath65 within the fragmentation problem it was shown @xcite that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined by the 1p1h states only and do not depend on the interaction between the 1p1h states and 2p2h states or more complex states and on any interaction in the 2p2h subspace , @xmath66 and @xmath67 it is important to stress that equations ( [ eq : srpa_zero ]  [ eq : frag_one ] ) follow from the properties of algebraic equations to be solved .",
    "so they should be valid for results of _ any _ calculation .",
    "it is known that the interaction between the 1p1h and 2p2h states is responsible for the width of the giant resonance and causes some redistribution of the transition strength over the excitations energy @xcite .",
    "the conservation of zero and first moments has , however , a severe consequence for the problem of missing strength .",
    "we discuss it in the framework of the fragmentation problem , in which the moments @xmath68 and @xmath69 are separately conserved . as total transition strength and average excitation energy , @xmath70 ,",
    "are simultaneously conserved , we face the following situation . if an interaction between 1p1h states and more complex states moves a large fraction of the strength of the giant resonance to higher energies , then some strength has to be shifted into the low energy region in order to keep the ratio @xmath70 constant . as a result ,",
    "the strength distribution in the giant resonance region and below it would change completely .",
    "such an effect has been found by shell model calculations of the gt strength function @xcite , where the excited state space was enlarged by including the 2p2h configurations , the ground state was left untouched , and the described effect was exactly observed .",
    "the authors of @xcite calculated the gt strength function for @xmath71 , @xmath12 and @xmath72 in both the rpa and srpa .",
    "the realistic two - body forces based on a brueckner g - matrix were used as a nuclear residual interaction . according to the results of @xcite , a large fraction of the total gt strength",
    "was shifted towards higher excitation energies due to the interaction of the 1p1h states with 2p2h ones .",
    "simultaneously , the strength in the giant resonance region and below it was considerably reduced .",
    "the energy of the gt resonance does not decrease and in @xmath72 considerably increases .",
    "the subsequent calculations @xcite show that in the @xmath12 nucleus the average energies of gt transitions and spin - dipole @xmath73 transitions increased by @xmath74 in the srpa .",
    "now we consider equations ( [ eq : srpa_zero ] ) and ( [ eq : srpa_one ] ) . due to the large neutron excess in heavy nuclei the @xmath11 strength , measured in @xmath15 reactions , is much stronger than the @xmath75 strength related to @xmath76 reactions .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 is only a small fraction of @xmath78 and one can assume without making too big an error that @xmath78 and @xmath79 do practically not change when going from the rpa to srpa .",
    "then the arguments presented above for the fragmentation problem are applicable and a contradiction appears between the results of @xcite and the conservation of moments @xmath78 and @xmath79 . by this reason we can not consider the results of @xcite as correct ones .",
    "the discussion leads to the conclusion that the transfer of the gt transition strength to higher excitation energies , which is implied by the effect of missing strength , originates rather from the interaction between particle  hole configurations only than from the influence of 2p2h and more complex configurations .",
    "large gt matrix elements exist between single particle states with identical radial and orbital quantum numbers .",
    "the corresponding transitions have relatively low energy . therefore , residual interaction should mix two - quasiparticle states , those quasiparticles are from the same major shell ( @xmath9 ) with two - quasiparticle states containing quasiparticles from different major shells ( @xmath10 ) . in others",
    "words , it follows from the very existence of the effect of missing gt strength that residual forces between nucleons must have a characteristic property : strong interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath10 two - quasiparticle ( or particle - hole ) states exists .",
    "strength in @xmath12 .",
    "thick gray line is experimental distribution of the gt strength @xcite .",
    "lines labeled by ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) present the results of calculations with different values of @xmath80 . ]    an example of such a residual interaction is given by the phenomenological separable residual interaction discussed in detail in @xcite , @xmath81 here @xmath82 are isospin pauli matrices , and @xmath83_{jm}\\ ] ] is the one - body spin - multipole operator .",
    "we have shown here the spin - multipole part of residual interaction , the expression for a multipole one can be found in @xcite .",
    "the interaction with the radial form factor @xmath84 ( here @xmath85 is central part of saxon - woods potential ) has a surface character and may mix @xmath9 and @xmath10 particle - hole excitations .",
    "the results of calculation of the gt strength function in @xmath12 together with the experimental data of @xcite , where @xmath86 of the sum rule value @xmath87 was observed , are presented in fig.[fig : zr90gt ] .",
    "the gt strength function is shown as the running sum @xmath88 the lines marked by ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are the theoretical strength functions calculated with @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "it is easily seen in fig.[fig : zr90gt ] that new high - lying collective @xmath0 states appear . when @xmath92 grows the energy of the collective state and its @xmath93 increase . for others spherical nuclei theoretical gt strength functions",
    "have been calculated and compared with the experimental ones in @xcite .",
    "all examples confirm that for explanation of the effect of missing ( quenching ) of the gt strength the specific feature of nuclear residual interaction is required : there should be a strong mixing among the @xmath9 and @xmath10 particle - hole configurations .",
    "the appearance of this specific feature of residual interaction should be checked in other charge - exchange processes related to spin - isospin transitions .",
    "the spin - isospin transitions are observed in two weak interaction processes : beta - decay and muon capture .",
    "only a small fraction of the whole gt transition strength can usually be observed in beta decay because the limited energy release and variations in the gt strength function at low excitation energy affect noticeably theoretical @xmath94-values .",
    "this limitation is removed in the reaction of ordinary muon capture ( omc ) @xmath95 where states in a wide excitation energy range can be populated due to a relatively large muon mass , @xmath96 .",
    "the phase space factor of partial omc rate @xmath97 depends on the square of neutrino energy @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the excitation energy in the nucleus @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the masses of initial and final nuclei , @xmath103 is the muon binding energy in the muonic atom .",
    "for example , for @xmath104 the rate of muon capture @xmath105 { e_{\\nu } \\over 2 m_{p } }     + { 1 \\over 3 } \\bigl (       { g_{p } \\over g_{a } }       \\ , { e_{\\nu } \\over 2 m_{p } } \\bigr ) ^{2 }   + \\ldots \\biggr \\ } , \\hfill \\cr   } \\ ] ] here @xmath106 is the proton mass , and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are vector , axial - vector , weak - magnetic , and pseudoscalar couplings of weak nucleon current @xcite .",
    "the energy released in the muon capture is comparable with muon mass ; therefore , the relative error in theoretical @xmath97 caused by uncertainties in the theoretical strength function for the corresponding nuclear transitions is rather small @xmath111 in comparison with the ones in beta - decay , and one can hope that calculation in the rpa , which reproduces well the general features of strength functions of the corresponding transitions , will give a reasonable description of the omc rates .",
    "the total muon capture rate is calculated as the sum of the rates for all possible nuclear transitions @xmath112        the total omc rates for several even - even spherical nuclei are calculated and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we shortly present the main results .",
    "the @xmath113 are displayed in fig.[fig : omc_tot ] .",
    "the results of calculations , in which the separable residual interaction ( [ eq : residual ] ) with radial form factor ( [ eq : dudr ] ) has been used , are shown by the closed circles . for comparison",
    "the omc rates were calculated with the radial form factor of residual interaction @xmath114 in fig.[fig : omc_tot ] , the corresponding @xmath113 are shown by the open circles . for gt transitions @xmath115 , and the residual interaction with form factor ( [ eq : r_l ] ) reduces to simple @xmath116-forces used in @xcite .",
    "this interaction can not create high - excited @xmath0 states and can not reproduce the effect of missing strength , as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "the experimental data extracted from @xcite are pointed by the crosses and the line presents the phenomenological estimations of @xcite with the parameters fitted in @xcite . in the calculation the transitions from the @xmath117 ground state to the final states with @xmath118 were taken into account .",

    "it is shown that the distributions of transition strength over the excitation energy in @xmath13 nuclei extracted from weak and electromagnetic processes are in conflict with the ones obtained from charge - exchange nuclear reactions .",
