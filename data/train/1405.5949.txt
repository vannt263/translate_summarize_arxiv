    "_ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) has greatly improved our understanding of the nature of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon since it was successfully launched in 2004 . the burst alert telescope ( bat , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt , burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) onboard _ swift _ observe the grb prompt emission and afterglow up to days and even months ( zhang et al .",

    "it is known that the conventional long - short grb classification scheme , which was based on the bimodal burst duration ( @xmath0 ) distribution discovered from the grb survey observations with burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) , meets the theoretical speculations of two types of grbs from deaths of massive stars ( colgate 1974 ; woosley 1993 ) and mergers of two compact objects ( e.g. , paczyski 1986 , 1991 ; eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; narayan et al . 1992 ; bloom et al . 1999",
    "; see berger 2013 for a review ) . however , the erratic , bright x - ray flares and long , soft extended emission tails ( ee tails ) observed with bat and xrt challenge the simple classification using the @xmath0 criterion .",
    "it is also interesting that some short - duration grbs are likely originated from collapse of massive stars ( virgili et al .",
    "2011 ; zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; levesque et al .",
    "2010a , b ; xin et al .",
    "2011 ; belczynski et al . 2010 ) .",
    "qin et al . ( 2013 ) showed that the bimodal @xmath0 distribution is significantly affected by instrumental selection effects .",
    "a physically motivated classification scheme , i.e. type ii ( massive star origin ) vs. type i ( compact star origin ) , was proposed ( zhang 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) , which demands multiple observational criteria ( zhang et al . 2009 ) .",
    "other classification parameters were also proposed ( e.g. l et al .",
    "2010 ; goldstein et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the duration @xmath1 is not a good representative of the duration of internal energy dissipation processes driven by central engine activities .",
    "observationally , the grb emission we observe starts from the detector trigger time in the gamma - ray band .",
    "it is unclear what may happen prior to the grb trigger .",
    "the most extensively discussed grb model is the internal shock model ( rees & mszros 1994 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; maxham & zhang 2009 ; daigne et al .",
    "2011 ) , which suggests that the observed highly variable emission of grbs are from internal shocks due to the collisions of baryon - dominated shells ejected from the central engines .",
    "alternatively , a magnetically dominated outflow may be launched from the central engine ( zhang & peer 2009 ) , which dissipates magnetic fields either continuously ( e.g. drenkhahn & spruit 2002 ) or abruptly at large radii through internal collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart , zhang & yan 2011 ) . in general , the internal dissipation site should be above the photosphere and below the deceleration radius , and should have two emission components : a quasi - thermal emission component from the photosphere and a non - thermal component from the energy dissipation site ( internal shocks for a baryon - dominated outflow and magnetic dissipation site for a magnetically dominated flow ) , and the observed emission is generally believed to be a superposition of these components ( e.g. mszros & rees 2000 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ; toma et al . 2011 ; peer et al .",
    "indeed , photosphere emission is observed to be superposed on the non - thermal component in the spectra of some grbs ( e.g. , ryde 2005 ; ryde & peer 2009 ; ryde et al .",
    "2010 ; guiriec et al .",
    "2011 ; axelsson et al .",
    "2012 ) , and some grbs even have a dominant thermal component , e.g. grb 090902b ( ryde et al . 2010 ; zhang et al .",
    "2011 ) . for grbs with a massive star progenitor",
    ", there could be an additional emission site where the jet first breaks out from the star .",
    "the long - lasting soft emission from low - luminosity grbs has been attributed to the shock breakout emission ( e.g. grb 060218 , campana et al .",
    "2006 ; and x - ray outburst 080109 , soderberg et al .",
    "some authors have suspected that shock breakout or photosphere emission may give rise to precursor emission for long - duration grbs ( e.g. lyutikov & usov 2000 ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether there is any observational evidence in support of these claims .",
    "another interesting issue regarding the lifetime of grb internal energy dissipation processes is the residual emission post the episodes of the main burst .",
    "_ swift _ detected an ee tail in the bat band for some `` short '' grbs and bright x - ray flares in the xrt band for about half of _ swift _ grbs .",
    "both the ee tails and x - ray flares may signal the late central engine activities of grbs ( burrows et al . 2005a ; zhang et al .",

    "2012 ) proposed that radial angular momentum transfer in a massive disk may significantly prolong the lifetime of the accretion process and multiple episodes may be switched by a magnetic barrier ( e.g. , proga & zhang 2006 ) . in general , it would be interesting to check observationally whether the ee tail and x - ray flares share similar or different observational properties with respect to prompt gamma - rays .",
    "this paper presents a joint analysis of both bat and xrt data of grbs in order to give a global view of the emission from internal energy dissipation processes in grbs .",
    "we systematically study all the emission components that are likely related internal dissipation processes , including precursor emission , main episodes of prompt emission , extended emission tail , and x - ray flares .",

    "we extract the lightcurves and spectra for the bat data with the standard _ swift _ scientific tools . because of the narrowness of the bat band ,",
    "the bat spectra are usually fit with a single power - law model , which is adequate to fit the spectra in our sample ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .",
    "2011 ; zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) . in order to search for low - significance signal before and after the duration covered by @xmath0 ,",
    "the extracted bat lightcurves usually cover 200 - 300s prior to the bat triggers and 200 - 300s post @xmath0 of the grbs .",
    "the method of bayesian blocks ( bb ; scargle 1998 ) is used to search for possible signals in the lightcurves .",
    "we find that the radiation episodes are poorly identified with the 64ms - binned lightcurves .",
    "therefore , we re - bin the lightcurves with a bin size of 1s , 2s , 4s , and 8s , respectively , and pick up all blocks from the lightcurves based on our analysis with the bb method .",
    "we outline our bat data analysis procedure as follows .",
    "* select background time intervals , which are normally taken from @xmath4 seconds prior to the bat trigger and @xmath4 post @xmath0 .",
    "the selection of the background intervals is essential to identify a weak signal .",
    "we set a background time window and move the window to search for a proper background interval in which no block identified with the bb method has a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath5 greater than @xmath6 in an 8-second binned lightcurve , where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of the data in the window . *",

    "the criterion of an radiation episode is taken as @xmath8 .",
    "the increase of bin size can reduce the level of background noises .",
    "we calculate the corresponding @xmath7 of the background noises , and then analyze the temporal structure of the lightcurves with the bb method .",
    "note that a proper bin size is critical to identify a weak signal .",
    "the increase of bin size is helpful to identify a weak signal with a long duration , but may smear out an extremely short duration signal .",
    "therefore , we progressively re - bin the lightcurves in size of 1s , 2s , 4s , and 8s , until the possible weak signals can be identified .",
    "* measure the duration and separation of each episode .",
    "the duration of an episode is estimated with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the starting and ending times at @xmath12 .",
    "examples of our analysis with the bb method are shown in figure [ example ] with a typical long grb 041224 and a typical short grb 050925 .",
    "two separated emission episodes are identified for grb 041224 .",
    "one is the main episode in the time interval from @xmath13 to @xmath14 seconds , which is well identified from the 1s - binned lightcurve .",
    "it contains some overlapped pulses .",
    "it triggered bat at nearly the peak time interval of the lightcurve .",
    "a long , weak signal is also seen prior to the main episode , but its @xmath5 is smaller than 3 @xmath7 in the 1s - binned lightcurve . increasing the bin size to 2s",
    ", this episode stands out with @xmath15 .",
    "we therefore pick up this episode from the 2s - binned lightcurve .",
    "different from the main episode , this episode is composed of some significant flickerings and the emission level keeps almost constant . in the 4s and 8s binned lightcurves this episode",
    "can be recognized with a higher confidence level . the main episode is also followed by a weak , extended emission component , but its @xmath5 value is smaller than 3 in these lightcurves",
    "we do not identify it as an extended emission component from the lightcurves . for short grbs , especially for those extremely short grbs with duration less than 1 second , a large bin size may smear out its main episode , as shown in figure [ example ] for grb 050925 .",
    "we therefore prefer to identify an emission episode from the lightcurves in a small bin size for these grbs .",
    "the rapid slewing capacity of xrt makes it possible to catch the x - ray emission from very early to very late episodes of grbs ( burrows et al .",

    "we obtain the xrt lightcurves of all bursts in our sample from http://www.swift.ac.uk ( evans et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "the x - ray data are mixed with both flares and underlying power law afterglow segments , and are non - uniformly binned .",
    "we do not utilize the bb method to analysis the xrt data , but identify a flare with a criterion of @xmath16f / f @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the peak flux ( @xmath19 ) over the underlying flux @xmath20 .",
    "based on our analysis with the bb method , we identify emission episodes as connected blocks .",
    "one emission episode may contain one or several overlapped pulses . in view that x - ray flares are temporarily separated from prompt emission , we explore whether the main grb component may sometimes include multiple separated episodes .",
    "we find that the bat lightcurves of 73% grbs in our sample are composed of one episode only , and the others are composed of several episodes .",
    "we show the distributions of the durations ( @xmath21 ) and separation time intervals ( @xmath22 ) for the identified episodes in figure [ distribution ] .",
    "it is found that the typical @xmath21 range from 10 - 100 seconds .",
    "the @xmath22 distribution is also in the same range .",
    "precursors are of interest in our analysis .",
    "we find 50 grbs whose lightcurves start with a low-@xmath5 episode followed by a bright emission episode .",
    "the low-@xmath5 episode may be separated from or closely connected to the bright episode .",
    "traditionally , a precursor is defined if the early low-@xmath5 component triggers bat .",
    "we find that the low - s / n component in some grbs did not trigger bat . here",
    "we adopt the term _ precursor _ to refer to an early low - s / n component leading the main emissioin episode regardless of whether it triggered bat . among the 50 grbs ,",
    "22 were trigged with the precursor , whereas the other 28 grbs were triggered with the main bursts .",
    "figure [ lc_precursors_triggered ] and figure [ lc_precursors_non_triggered ] show the examples for the triggered and non - triggered precursors , respectively .",
    "we measure the duration of the precursor and its separation to the main episode based on our bb analysis results for each burst .",
    "our results are reported in table 1 .",
    "the average count rate ratio of the precursor to the main burst spans from 0.05 to 0.5 , with a typical value of @xmath23 , as shown in figure [ precursor_ratio_and_interval ] left .",
    "the distribution of the ratio between the durations of the precursor and the main episode is shown in figure [ precursor_ratio_and_interval ] right .",
    "it is found that the majority of precursors are shorter than the main burst .",
    "the duration ratio concentrates around 0.5 .",
    "we also extract and fit the spectra of the precursors and the main bursts of these grbs .",

    "we find that photon indices of the precursors are comparable to those of the main episodes .",
    "we do not find any systematic differences between the triggered and non - triggered precursors .",
    "these results seems to indicate that the precursor is a weak emission episode that has the same origin as the main burst in a grb .",
    "fifty seven grbs with @xmath26 seconds are included in our sample . except for grb 090510",
    ", we do not find other strong cases that have a significant precursor .",
    "since it is a high - luminosity short grb , the possibility that it is a type ii grb is not ruled out ( zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; panaitescu 2011 ; bromberg et al .",
    "this result likely indicates that the precursors preferably happen in grbs associated with collapses of massive stars ( type ii grbs ) , and but not in grbs produced by mergers of compact stars ( type i ) .",
    "we recognize the weak episode following the main episode as an ee tail with a criterion that the ee tail has a count rate that is lower than 50% of the mean count rate of the main burst ( except for grb 060614 whose ee tail is even brighter ) .",
    "such an ee tail was detected for 36 grbs in our sample .",
    "we extract the spectra of the ee tails in these grbs and fit them with a simple power law model .",
    "our analysis for the ee tails are reported in table 2 .",
    "figure [ fig_comp_gamma_main_pre_and_ee ] right shows the comparison of the photon index of the ee component ( @xmath27 ) to that of the main episode .",
    "it is found that the ee tails are softer than that of the main episode .",
    "we show some typical lightcurves with such a component in figure [ lc_ees ] .",
    "one of the most prominent feature of these lightcurves is that they usually start with a bright and sharp spikes .",
    "grb 060614 is a prototype of the ee tails .",
    "some grbs whose lightcurves are similar to that of grb 060614 are shown in the first three rows of figure [ lc_ees ] .",
    "the ee tails are usually highly variable and their brightness gradually decreases .",
    "the bright ee tails detected in some grbs may extend up to @xmath28 seconds , even hundreds of seconds , after the bat trigger . besides the grb 060614-like events",
    ", the ee tails in some grbs show as continuous fluctuations with amplitudes being much smaller than the initial spikes , such as those as observed in grb 061006 and 111121a . according to our analysis , ee tails",
    "are usually detected in some `` short '' grbs .",
    "these grbs are usually classified as short since their ee tails are ignored in @xmath0 calculations .",
    "we therefore do not include these grbs in our analysis to keep a uniform criterion for both precursors and extended emission tails . ] .",
    "the lightcurves of typical long grbs are composed of several separated pulses . in case that the amplitude of these pulses decreases with time",
    ", the later pulses may be identified as ee tails .",
    "excluding this kind of grbs , we find a prominent ee tail only in grb 070420 .",
    "therefore , if both grb 060614-liked grbs and grb 061006-liked grbs have the same origin ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) , the ee tails may preferably happen in grbs from compact star mergers ( type i ) .",
    "x - ray flares observed with xrt evidence that grb phenomenon is also bright in the x - ray band .",
    "we derive the x - ray flux in the xrt band by extrapolating the bat data to the xrt band and make a joint x - ray lightcurve from bat trigger to late epochs as observed with xrt .",
    "we take the peak time ( @xmath29 ) of the last x - ray flare as an indicator of the end of the internal energy dissipation processes . in order to give a robust estimate of @xmath29 ,",
    "we search for sub - samples of grbs whose bat and xrt data are well connected without a gap , or whose significant flares are observed after a gap indicating that the internal energy dissipation process is still alive at late times .",
    "we have such a sub - sample of 159 grbs .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 values of 30% grbs are comparable to @xmath29 , indicating that @xmath0 would be a good measure of the duration of the the internal energy dissipation processes in these grbs .",

    "xrt promptly slewed to catch the x - ray emission after the first trigger .",

    "the second bright , short gamma - ray peak is just at the peak of the x - ray emission .",

    "a precursor is observed in about 10% of the bat grbs , most of which are of long - duration grbs . about half of the precursors triggered bat to alert the grb , but we do not find any statistical differences of the photon indices between the triggered and non - triggered precursors , and their photon indices are also roughly consistent with those of the main burst .",

    "time intervals between bright episodes in the band range from tens of seconds to hundreds of seconds , and a long quiescent phase is shown for some grbs .",
    "however , bright x - ray emission is detected during the bat quiescent phase .",
    "these results suggest that what we have seen in the gamma - ray band may be only the tip of iceberg of more extended underlying activities",
    ". the duration of the gamma - ray emission may be only a short period of the life time of the entire internal energy dissipation processes .",
    "the physical origin of the precursor is of great interest .",
    "previously some authors suggested an early photosphere emission origin or shock break out origin ( lyutikov & usov 2000 ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "our analysis shows no significant difference between the precursor emission and the main emission episode , suggesting that very likely precursors share the same physical origin as the prompt episode , which is directly related to the central engine activities .",
    "one interesting question in grb studies is whether there is emission prior to the grb trigger time .",
    "the detection of precursors prior to the main burst indicate that the burst activities can in principle start prior to the main explosion .",
    "a grb trigger is instrumentally dependent .",
    "the trigger probability of low s / n signals drops rapidly ( e.g. , qin et al . 2013 ) .",
    "an off - line analysis of cgro / batse data showed that about 1838 out of 3906 grbs were detected but did not trigger batse ( stern et al .",
    "2001 ) . as shown in our analysis , only about @xmath36 of precursors triggered bat .",
    "in addition , our joint bat and xrt lightcurves shown in figure [ lc_quiescence ] indicate that bright x - ray emission may be detectable during the bat quiescent phase .",
    "currently , the xrt observations usually start at least tens of seconds post the grb trigger .",
    "we do not have x - ray observations prior to the bat triggers . on the other hand , based on xrt observations to the second peaks of grbs 110709b and 121217a",
    ", one may suspect that bright x - ray emission may come even prior to the first episode that triggers bat .",
    "the time interval of @xmath0 would be only a short , violent episode of the bursts .",
    "therefore , the exact starting time of a burst event could be ( much ) prior to the bat trigger .",
    "this effect may also significantly affect our understanding of the temporal behaviors of the early shallow - decay x - ray emission ( e.g. yamazaki 2009 ; liang et al .",
    "2009 , but see birnbaum et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "it is interesting that precursors preferably happen in type ii grbs , which are produced by collapses of massive stars .",
    "as discussed above , the precursors , main burst , and late flares would all come from the internal energy dissipation of a relativistic outflow powered by the grb central engine .",
    "popular grb central engine models are related to a hyper - accreting black hole ( e.g. , popham et al . 1999 ; narayan et al . 2001 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ; gu et al .",

    "; lei et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the detection of precursors in type ii grbs likely imply that the grb central engine may have some weak activities prior to the main explosion during the collapse of a massive star .",
    "the lack of detection of a precursor in type i grbs , together with the fact that the lightcurves of type i grbs usually starts with extremely sharp and bright spikes , seem to suggest that compact star mergers may start with most violent activities of the central engine .",
