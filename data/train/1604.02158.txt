    "most if not all biological processes are characterized by complex interactions among bio - molecules such as proteins .",
    "a common way to decipher such interactions is through multichannel fluorescence microscopic imaging where each molecule is labeled with fluorescence of a unique emission wavelength , and their biological interactions can be identified with correlation between the expression of fluorescent proteins in certain compartments . although an ad hoc approach , visual inspection of the overlayed image from both channels is arguably the most common way to determine colocalization in multichannel fluorescence microscopy .",
    "potential pitfalls of this nave strategy , however , are also well - documented as merged images are heavily influenced by factors such as bleed - through , cross - talk , and relative intensities between different channels .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .    since the pioneering work of manders and his collaborators in early 1990s ,",
    "quantitative methods have also been introduced to colocalization analysis .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these approaches typically proceed by first manually selecting a region where the two molecules are likely to colocalize .",
    "the degree of colocalization is then measured through various notions of correlation coefficient , most notably pearson s correlation coefficient or menders correlation coefficient , computed specific to the chosen area .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , parmryd , @xcite , @xcite among others .",
    "obviously , the performance of these approaches depends critically on the manually - selected region of interest , which not only makes the analysis subjective but also creates a bottleneck for high - throughput microscopic imaging processes .",
    "moreover , even if the region is selected in a principled way , colocalization may not be directly inferred from the value of the correlation coefficient computed on the region because the value of the coefficient itself does not translate into statistical significance .",
    "this problem could be alleviated using permutation tests , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "in doing so , however , one still neglects the fact that the region of interest is selected based upon its plausibility of colocalization , and the resulting p - value may appear significant merely because of our failure to adjust for the selection bias .",
    "the present work is motivated by this need for an automated and statistically valid way to detect colocalization .",
    "colocalization analysis can naturally be formulated as an example of a broad class of problems that we shall refer to as structured correlation detection where we observe multiple collections of random variables on a common domain and want to determine if there is a subset of these variables that are correlated .",
    "these types of problem arise naturally in many different fields .",
    "for example , in finance , detecting time periods where two common stocks show unusual correlation is essential to the so - called pairs trading strategy ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other potential examples of structured correlation detection problems can also be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among many others .",

    "the problem of colocalization analysis , however , is unique in at least two critical aspects .",
    "first , most if not all existing works focus exclusively on signals at the mean level .",
    "our interest here , on the other hand , is on the correlation coefficient .",
    "not only do we want to detect signals in terms of the correlation , but also we want to do so in the presence of unknown marginal means and variances as nuisance parameters .",
    "in addition , prior work typically deals with situations where @xmath0 is one - dimensional and @xmath13 is a collection of segments , which is amenable to statistical analysis and sometimes also allows for fast computation . in the case of colocalization analysis , however , the index set @xmath0 is multidimensional and the set @xmath13 usually contains more complex geometric shapes . to address both challenges ,",
    "we develop in this article a general methodology for correlation detection on a general domain that can be readily applied for colocalization analysis .",
    "our method is motivated by an observation that , for a fairly general family of @xmath13 , the likelihood ratio statistics exhibit a subtle dependence on the size of a candidate region . as a result , their direct use for correlation detection may lead to nontrivial bias , and substantially reduced power . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we introduce a size - corrected likelihood ratio statistic and show that scanning with the corrected likelihood ratio statistic yields optimal correlation detection for a large family of @xmath13 in the sense that it can detect elevated correlation at a level no other detectors could improve significantly .",
    "we show that the corrected likelihood ratio statistic based scan can also be computed efficiently for a large collection of geometric shapes in arbitrary dimension , characterized by their covering numbers under a suitable semimetric .",
    "this includes among others , convex polygons or ellipses , arguably two of the most commonly encountered shapes in practice .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a size - corrected likelihood ratio statistic for a general index set @xmath0 and collection @xmath13 , and discuss how it can be used to detect colocalization .",
    "we shall also investigate efficient implementation as well as theoretical properties of the proposed method .",
    "section [ sec : ex ] gives several concrete examples of @xmath0 and @xmath13 and show how the general methodology can be applied to these specific situations .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ sec : num ] to further illustrate the merits of the proposed methods .",
    "proofs are given in section [ sec : proof ] , with auxiliary results relegated to the appendix .",
    "in a general correlation detection problem , @xmath0 can be an arbitrary index set and @xmath18 is a given collection of subsets of @xmath0 , and we are interested in testing the null hypothesis @xmath19 that ( [ eq : modelh0 ] ) holds for all @xmath1 against a composite alternative @xmath20 that ( [ eq : model ] ) holds for all @xmath16 whereas ( [ eq : modelh0 ] ) holds for all @xmath21 , for some @xmath14 .",
    "we shall argue in this section that the usual maximum log - likelihood ratio statistic may not be suitable for correlation detection , and introduce a size - based correction to address the problem .",
    "a natural test statistic for our purpose is the scan , or maximum log - likelihood ratio statistic : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the log - likelihood ratio statistic for testing @xmath19 : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the cardinality of @xmath5 and @xmath26 is pearson correlation within @xmath5 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 it is worth noting that strictly speaking , @xmath23 defined by ( [ eq : lr ] ) is not the genuine likelihood ratio statistic , which would replace the factor @xmath29 on the right hand side of ( [ eq : lr ] ) by @xmath25 .",
    "our modification accounts for the correct degrees of freedom so that , for a fixed uncorrelated region @xmath5 , @xmath30 see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "obviously , when @xmath25 is large , @xmath23 approximately follows a @xmath31 distribution and the effect of such correction becomes negligible .",
    "the use of scan or maximum log - likelihood ratio statistics for detecting spatial clusters or signals is very common across a multitude of fields .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "their popularity is also justified as it is well known that scan statistics are minimax optimal if @xmath25 is small when compared with @xmath32 .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "but we show here that such a strategy may not be effective for correlation detection unless @xmath25 is very small . in particular ,",
    "we show that , in the absence of a correlated region , the magnitude of @xmath23 depends critically on its size @xmath25 , and therefore , the maximum of @xmath23 s over regions of different sizes is typically dominated by those evaluated on smaller regions . as a result , direct use of @xmath33 for correlation detection could be substantially conservative in detecting larger correlated regions .",
    "we now examine the behavior of the maximum of @xmath23 for @xmath14 of a particular size .",
    "note that it is possible that there is no element in @xmath13 that is of a particular size . to avoid lengthy discussion to account for such trivial situations",
    ", we shall consider instead the subset @xmath34\\},\\ ] ] for some positive @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , @xmath36 is the collection of all possible correlated regions of size between @xmath37 and @xmath35 .",
    "the factor of @xmath38 is chosen arbitrarily and can be replaced by any constant in @xmath39 .",
    "basically @xmath36 includes elements of @xmath13 that , roughly speaking , are of size @xmath35 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath40 we shall argue that @xmath41 may have different magnitudes for different @xmath35s under the null hypothesis . in particular , we shall show that for a large collection of @xmath36 , @xmath41 can be characterized precisely .",
    "obviously , the behavior of @xmath41 depends on the complexity of @xmath36 .",
    "more specifically , we shall first assume that the possible correlated regions are indeed more structured than arbitrary subsets of @xmath0 in that there exist constants @xmath42 independent of @xmath35 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 increases with @xmath35 only polynomially .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the completely unstructured setting where @xmath45 , the collection of all subsets of @xmath0 , and the number of all subsets of @xmath0 of size @xmath35 is of the order @xmath46 , which depends on @xmath35 exponentially .",
    "condition ( [ eq : comp ] ) essentially requires that @xmath13 is a much smaller subset of @xmath47 and therefore indeed imposes structures on the possible regions of correlation .",
    "nave counting of the size of @xmath36 as above , however , may not reflect its real complexity . to this end",
    ", we also need to characterize the dissimilarity of elements of @xmath36 .",
    "for any two sets @xmath48 , write @xmath49 it is easy to see that @xmath50 is a semimetric on @xmath51 .",
    "we now consider the covering number of sets of a particular size in @xmath13 under @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the smallest integer such that there is a subset , denoted by @xmath54 , of @xmath13 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 it is worth emphasizing that we require the covering set @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath53 is a decreasing function of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we shall also adopt the convention that @xmath60 represents the largest number of non - overlapping elements from @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , without any structural assumption , we can always divide @xmath0 into @xmath61 subsets of size @xmath35 .",
    "we shall assume that the collection @xmath36 is actually rich enough that @xmath62 for some constant @xmath63 .",
    "conversely , we shall assume also that there are not too many `` distinct '' sets in @xmath36 in that there are certain constants @xmath64 independent of @xmath35 and @xmath65 such that @xmath66    conditions ( [ eq : comp ] ) , ( [ eq : entropy0 ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) are fairly general and hold for many common choices of @xmath13 .",
    "consider , for example , the case when @xmath67 is a one - dimensional sequence and @xmath68 : 0\\le a < b\\le n\\}\\ ] ] is the collection of all possible segments on @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that there are at most @xmath69 segments of length @xmath70 for any @xmath71 $ ] , which means @xmath72 in addition , for any @xmath35 , there are at least @xmath73 distinct segments @xmath74 : i=1,\\ldots , \\lfloor n / a\\rfloor\\},\\ ] ] of length @xmath35 , implying that ( [ eq : entropy0 ] ) also holds . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not hard to see that the collection of all segments starting at @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) of length between @xmath37 and @xmath35 can approximate any segment of length between @xmath37 and @xmath35 with approximation error @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 so that ( [ eq : entropy ] ) also holds . in the next section , we shall consider more complex examples motivated by colocalization analysis and show that these conditions are expected to hold in fairly general settings .",
    "we now show that if @xmath36 satisfies these conditions , @xmath41 concentrates sharply around @xmath78 .",
    "[ th : emp ] suppose that ( [ eq : modelh0 ] ) holds for all @xmath1 . assume also that ( [ eq : comp ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) hold .",
    "then @xmath79 if in addition , ( [ eq : entropy0 ] ) holds , then @xmath80    we adopted a generic chaining ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) argument for the proof of theorem [ th : emp ] .",
    "the analysis itself may be of independent interest and can be applied to other similar problems such as deriving asymptotic bounds for likelihood ratio statistics in structured detection of mean shifts .",
    "an immediate consequence of theorem [ th : emp ] is that the value of @xmath33 alone may not be a good measure of the evidence of correlation .",
    "it also depends critically on the size of @xmath5 for which @xmath23 is maximized . as such , when using @xmath33 as a test statistic , the critical value is largely driven by @xmath41 corresponding to smaller @xmath35 s .",
    "therefore , a test based on @xmath33 could be too conservative when correlation is present on a region with a large cardinality .",
    "motivated by this observation , we now consider normalizing @xmath41 , leading to a size - corrected log - likelihood ratio statistic : @xmath81\\right\\}\\\\ & = & \\max_{r\\in \\rcal } \\left\\{{1\\over \\log\\log(n/|r|)}\\left[l_r-2\\log\\left({n\\over |r|}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for brevity , we shall hereafter assume that @xmath82 . in general , we can always replace @xmath83 by @xmath84 to avoid the trivial cases where the logarithms may not be well defined .",
    "it is clear that under the null hypothesis , the distribution of @xmath85 is invariant to the nuisance parameters and therefore can be readily evaluated through monte carlo simulation .",
    "more specifically , one can simulate @xmath86 independently for @xmath1 , and compute @xmath85 for the simulated data .",
    "the distribution of @xmath85 can be approximated by the empirical distribution of the test statistics estimated by repeating this process .",
    "denote by @xmath87 the @xmath88-quantile of @xmath85 under the null hypothesis .",

    "this clearly is an @xmath90-level test by construction .",
    "we shall show that in section [ sec : th ] , it is also a powerful test for detecting correlation .",

    "to compute @xmath85 , we need to enumerate all elements in @xmath13 , which could be quite burdensome .",

    "more specifically , it is noted that although numerous , regions of large size , namely @xmath36 with a large @xmath35 , may have fewer `` distinct '' elements . as such , we do not need to evaluate @xmath23 on each @xmath91 but rather on a smaller covering set @xmath36 .    with slight abuse of notation ,",

    "in other words , the number of size - corrected likelihood ratio statistics we need to evaluate in computing @xmath107 is linear in @xmath112 , up to a certain polynomial of logarithmic factor .",
    "while a general methodology was presented for correlation detection under a generic domain in the previous section , we now examine more specific examples motivated by colocalization analysis in microscopic imaging , and discuss further the operating characteristics of the proposed approach . in particular , we shall focus on correlation detection in a two - dimensional lattice where @xmath113 so that @xmath114 , for concreteness , although the discussion can be extended straightforwardly to more general situations such as rectangular or higher order lattices .",
    "most of the imaging tools allow users to visually identify areas of colocalization using variants of the lasso tool .",

    "nuclear export of a segment of the viral grna bearing the rev response element ( rre ) is essential to hiv gene regulation , viral replication and disease .",
    "it is well established that this process is regulated by a viral rev trafficking protein that binds to the rre and recruits the cellular crm1 nuclear export receptor .",
    "in addition to nuclear export , rev may also play a role in grna encapsidation and translation of grna . to gain insight into rev s motility in the nucleus and cytoplasm to better understand rev trafficking dynamics , as well as rev s roles in viral gene expression and virus particle assembly live cell imaging was employed to monitor rev and crm1 behavior .",
    "it is expected that the rev / crm1/rre ribonuclear complex will have high colocalization in the cytoplasm during the viral life cycle .",
    "it has been shown that hiv-1 genomic rnas ( grnas ) frequently exhibit  burst \" nuclear export kinetics .",
    "these events are characterized by striking en masse evacuations of grnas from the nucleus to flood the cytoplasm in conjunction with the onset of viral late gene expression .",
    "burst nuclear export is regulated through interactions between the viral protein rev , cellular nuclear export factor crm1 , and the grna s cis - acting rna rev response element ( rre ) . by monitoring mutant versions of the rev protein unable to bind crm1 , export element deficient versions of the grna ( rre minus ) , and lack of grna in the visual system , we can determine crm1 trafficking behavior in the context of the virus .",
    "a specific data example is given in figure [ fig : colocal ] where dual - channel images of a wild type cell and a mutant cell are presented side - by - side .",
    "in each image , crm1 is represented by green and the grna by red .",
    "while the `` burst '' nuclear export is visible for the wild type cell , it is less evident for the mutant cell . to further quantify such differences between the two cell types , we applied our method to this particular example following standard steps to preprocess the   and evaluate its corresponding p - value again by simulating the null distribution through 1000 monte carlo experiments . for the wild type cell",
