    "following an initial report of a fast radio burst by @xcite , @xcite discovered four additional events whose large dispersion measures ( dm @xmath2 pc@xmath3 ) and high galactic latitudes @xmath4 indicated that their sources were at cosmological distances .",
    "subsequently , more frb were discovered ( the present total is ten ) .",
    "their measured parameters include fluence , dispersion measure ( dm ) and pulse widths .",
    "several frb have dedispersed and deconvolved pulse widths @xmath5 at 1300 mhz of several ms , while only upper limits were found for others .",
    "fitting @xmath6 for frb with measured @xmath7 , their scattering indices @xmath8 , consistent with theoretical values for multipath propagation spreading in a plasma medium @xcite and apparently confirming that the burst widths are not instrumental artefacts because the propagation delay @xmath9 over a narrow frequency band @xmath10 , but @xmath11 is outside the measured range of uncertainty of at least one frb @xcite . ] .",
    "in homogeneous kolmogorov turbulence @xmath12 , consistent with all values of @xmath13 measured for frb , but inconsistent with many pulsar data @xcite .    this paper explores the implications of the distributions of frb scattering widths , fluences and dispersion measures and the assumption that the dispersion measures indicate cosmological distances .",
    "any explanation of these observations must first account for two facts : ( 1 ) all frb have dispersion measures within a range of a factor of about three ( two if the lorimer burst is not accepted as an frb ) , implying a general property , not an unusual circumstance such as a line of sight that happens to intersect a rare dense cloud ; ( 2 ) the dispersion index @xmath14 , defined by the dispersive delay relation @xmath15 , is very close to @xmath16 and consistent with exactly @xmath16 for every frb , implying an upper bound on the density of the dispersing plasma and ( combined with the measured dm ) a lower bound on its size .",
    "these facts are readily accounted for if most of the dispersion is intergalactic , in which case the conventional assumptions that most of the cosmic baryon density is ionized and homogeneous permits the inference of the source redshifts @xmath17 from the observed dm .",
    "searches for frb typically impose a minimum dm of 200 pc@xmath3 as a filter against local interference and a maximum dm of 2000 pc@xmath3 because of pulse smearing in finite - width receiver filters , so that the absence of observed frb dm outside the range 2002000 pc@xmath3 does not imply their non - existence .",
    "galactic frb at high latitude would be essentially unobservable because of the low dm cutoff , unless they are surrounded by dense ionized matter , and frb with cosmological redshift @xmath18 are not observable because of the high dm cutoff .",
    "the frequency - dependent temporal broadening poses a different problem .",
    "it is difficult to attribute it to intergalactic space or to our galaxy at the high galactic latitudes of eight of the ten reported frb because much lower upper bounds can be placed on the broadening of at least some galactic pulsars @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the broadening originates near the sources of the frb .",
    "if their hosts resemble the galaxies known to us , they would be expected to contribute ( unless fortuitously edge - on spirals ) only a small fraction of either the broadening or the dispersion .",
    "whatever the nature of the compact objects making frb , it is implausible that the properties of their host galaxies differ by an order of magnitude from those of galaxies known to us .",
    "this suggests that the pulse broadening occurs in an immediate environment of the frb that may differ from the general interstellar medium of the host galaxies ( and of our own ) .",

    "the immediate environment of the frb must be much more strongly scattering than ordinary interstellar media , indicating a causal relation with the frb itself .",

    "this should be compared to the classic result for a rotation - powered pulsar s spindown power ( converted to radio emission with an efficiency that is @xmath65 for all known radio pulsars ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the scaled magnetic dipole moment and @xmath68 is the scaled rotation frequency .",

    "perhaps the same object might be both a sgr and an frb @xcite , though at different times or at different places in its magnetosphere .",
    "for example , psr j1745@xmath782900 is observed both as an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( and hence is often termed a magnetar ; @xcite ) and as a radio pulsar @xcite emitting high - brightness nonthermal radiation .    a galactic frb , if above the horizon , could have been detected in the far sidelobes of any radio telescope observing in the l - band @xcite with sufficient time resolution to detect a transient .",

    "for example , ignoring the @xmath178 factor in @xmath179 that results from the from the @xmath17 dependence of the frequency of radiation along its path leads to a fit similar to that of figure  [ frbcosmo ] ( but with a different @xmath176 ) .",

    "understanding of the high brightness emission of frb may be as elusive as understanding of the emission of radio pulsars has been , nearly 50 years after their discovery .",
    "radio pulsars were very quickly identified on the basis of their periods and slowing with rotating neutron stars .",
    "no such clues exist for frb .",
    "even with only ten published frb , and without a specific model of their sources , statistical arguments can constrain their origin , both physical and spatial . their qualitative resemblance to radio pulsars , and in particular to the rare giant pulses of a few pulsars , suggests that they may be analogous events , writ large .",
    "elementary energetic considerations show that this may be possible , but if so their sources must be very young neutron stars .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that , surrounded by young , dense , compact snr , much of the dispersion measures of frb may be attributed to those snr @xcite .",
    "if so , the distances to frb may be much closer than those indicated by attributing their dispersion measures to the intergalactic medium , relaxing the constraints on their energetics implied by the assumption of cosmological distances .",
    "this hypothesis predicts a specific form for the distribution of frb dispersion measures .",
    "unfortunately , comparison to the data ( fig .",
    "[ frbsnr ] ) shows a poor fit at both low and high dispersion measures .",
    "the former might be explained by termination of frb activity as the neutron star spins down ( or ages in some other manner ) , in analogy to the pulsar `` death line '' , but the absence of frb with very high dispersion measures is an argument against this origin of their dispersion .    the classic @xmath0@xmath1 test , where @xmath21 is the frb fluence rather than the ( unmeasured ) flux , may also be applied ( fig .",
    "[ frbnvs ] ) .",
    "a fit to the relation @xmath156 applicable to euclidean geometry ( cosmologically local sources ) is adequate at intermediate values of @xmath21 .",
    "a deficiency of low fluence frb may be explained by sample incompleteness .",
    "if so , the fit at higher fluences indicates a source population with @xmath180 , but excludes a spatially bounded distribution such as the galactic halo .",
    "similar conclusions may be drawn from the distribution of frb dispersion measures less than a cutoff ( fig .",
    "[ frbcosmo ] ) .",
    "a simple model that includes both cosmologically local and distant sources ( but that ignores the unknown evolution of the source population , and hence must be considered only qualitative for @xmath181 ) provides a good fit .",
    "in contrast to the similar inferences from the @xmath0@xmath1 data , this conclusion does not depend on additional explanations of apparent deviations from the model .",
    "a robust conclusion , independent of any caveats applicable for @xmath182 , is that the source population is homogeneously distributed in space at smaller @xmath17 .",
    "this is an essentially euclidean conclusion , but the satisfactory fit for @xmath183 suggests that the distances are those inferred from the assumption that the dispersion measures are intergalactic .",
    "this is supported by the failure of the alternative expanding cloud ( snr ) models of the dispersing matter ( fig .",
    "[ frbsnr ] ) .",
    "thee fact that this cosmological model of the distribution of dispersion measures is consistent with the data implies that nearly all the dispersion is intergalactic , in contrast with models @xcite in which a large portion of the dispersion measure is attributed to gas local to the frb .",
    "the extraordinarily intense lorimer burst is not consistent with @xmath184 .",
    "the absence of weaker events was noted by @xcite , and indicates that it comes from a different population . with a fluence @xmath185 times the detection threshold , a homogeneous distribution in euclidean space ( its comparatively small dispersion measure indicates it must be cosmologically local ) would suggest that @xmath186 weaker events should have been detected , in contrast to the 10 actually detected , an anomaly that is significant at the @xmath187% level ( the detection of 10 weaker events implies a 1% probability of detecting one as strong as the lorimer burst ) .",
    "if this was neither a statistical fluke ( because of the need to reject anthropogenic transients , early searches may have had effective detection thresholds higher than their nominal thresholds ) nor anthropogenic interference , it implies the lorimer burst came from a distinct space - limited population whose local density far exceeds its mean cosmological density .",
    "speculative possibilities include classes of intrinsically less luminous bursts in the galactic halo or the local supercluster .",
    "since the discovery of frb there has been concern that they might be anthropogenic , rather than astronomical , phenomena .",
    "this concern was exacerbated by the discovery by @xcite of manifestly anthropogenic perytons , whose sources were recently identified by @xcite as microwave ovens .",
    "could frb also be anthropogenic interference , perhaps chirped radar pulses ?",
    "a ground - based radar might enter of sidelobes of a radio telescope , but would appear in all 13 parkes beams , unlike the frb . hence we consider a radar on a satellite that might pass through a beam .",
    "radar systems may use chirped emission , compressed upon reception into narrow pulses , in order to obtain accurate range measurements without requiring excessive peak transmitted powers .",
    "the observation of frb in a single beam at parkes , in contrast to perytons @xcite , indicates a distance @xmath188 km , outside the first fresnel zone , consistent with a radar satellite .",
    "there is no obvious reason for a radar to have a chirp @xmath189 as observed , nor is there obvious reason not .",
    "however , the observed dispersed pulse durations of several tenths of a second would imply , for monostatic radar , target distances of at least half that light travel time to avoid interference of the transmission with the received scattered radiation .",
    "such distances would be @xmath190 cm , far beyond the range to plausible targets , and the return would be undetectably weak .",
    "in contrast , bistatic radar can use arbitrarily long pulses .",
    "the pulse repetition intervals would have to have been longer than the lengths of time the radars were anywhere in the 13 beams of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( about 0.3 s for a radar near the zenith in low earth orbit ) , yet the pulse durations must have been shorter than the time required to cross a single beam",
    ". this explanation would also require at least as many radar satellites , each with a different chirp rate , as frb , because each frb had a different dispersion measure , or satellites whose chirp rates were variable in some non - obvious manner .",
    "this combination of requirements makes the hypothesis of interference by an orbital chirped source implausible .",
