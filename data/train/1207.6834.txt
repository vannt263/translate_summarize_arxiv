    "ever since the discovery of pseudogap in high temperature superconductors , it has been a profound mystery .",
    "@xcite to this day , its origin is vigorously debated . in one view , pseudogap is a remnant of the @xmath0-wave superconducting gap that defines a crossover temperature @xmath5 in the phase diagram .",
    "the other view argues for a broken symmetry at @xmath5 .",
    "the precise nature of the broken symmetry is debated , however .",
    "@xcite the central defining property of the pseudo gap is a strongly momentum dependent gap of @xmath6 character . at least at the level of hartree - fock mean field theory , and perhaps even on more general grounds , it is difficult to see how translationally invariant order parameters  @xcite in the _ particle - hole _ channel can produce a gap .",
    "by contrast in the _ particle - particle _ channel , i.e. in a superconductor , the gap is tied to the fermi surface , not to the lattice , and there is no necessity for a broken translational symmetry to produce a momentum dependent gap . here , we shall assume that much of the phenomenology associated with the pseudogap can be described in a unified manner by the single assumption of a spin singlet @xmath7 density wave ( ddw )   @xcite and deduce some observable consequences that should help its detection .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to calculate the spectrum of the amplitude mode , the analog of the recently discovered higgs mode in high energy physics , for the ddw state .",
    "as we shall see , this turns out to be very unusual and was missed in a very early paper @xcite on this subject because of the simplicity of the formalism , which did not take into account all possible fluctuations even in the context of an order parameter formalism .",
    "nonetheless , it was shown explicitly that a damped amplitude mode at @xmath8 should be observable in inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "since then it was discovered that ddw model need to be extended in order to solve the specific heat puzzle : to date no specific heat singularity is observed at the pseudogap transition .",
    "this extension was described in ref .  .",
    "with this extension no specific heat singularity arises at the psudogap / ddw transition .",
    "while the hartree - fock theory captures the broad overall picture of the phase diagram ,  @xcite by its very nature it can not properly address the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "given the recent advances in experiments , it is therefore important to explore the consequences of the special fluctuation spectrum of the extended ddw model , which goes well beyond the hartree - fock theory .",
    "this is precisely what we would like to accomplish in the present paper .    within the extended ddw model",
    ", we shall find that although the ddw order parameter condenses at the wave vector @xmath2 , remarkably , the amplitude or higgs mode spectrum can be peaked at both @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "these results provide important clues regarding the recent experiments on the cuprates @xcite , which quite unexpectedly find multiple magnetic excitation modes at different wave vectors , the precise origin of which has been mysterious . as to the elastic signature of singlet ddw ,",
    "two neutron scattering measurements provide some evidence for it  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the identification of the ddw state can be considerably strengthened by careful experimentation of the predictions of the inelastic amplitude spectrum that we offer .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we set out the model and in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the fluctuation spectrum in detail .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "iv followed by discussion in sec . v.",
    "the singlet ddw , as originally envisioned , consists of circulating currents ,  @xcite alternating between clockwise and anticlockwise directions in the neighboring plaquettes of an underlying square lattice in two - dimensional ( @xmath9 ) cuo@xmath10 planes .",
    "the particle - hole spin - singlet ddw order parameter is @xmath11 where @xmath12 are electron annihilation and creation operators , and @xmath13 are the spin indices ; @xmath14 is the magnitude of the order parameter and the form factor @xmath15 ; we set the lattice constant to unity throughout .",
    "viewed from this perspective , the ordered state can be constructed as a juxtaposition of two kinds of current conserving vertices , as shown in vertices 5 and 6 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the ordered state breaks time reversal , rotation by @xmath16 , parity , and translational symmetry by one lattice spacing , but the product of any two of these symmetries is preserved .",
    "the statistical mechanics belongs to the ising universality class ,  @xcite and in hartree - fock theory the order disappears when the magnitude of the bond currents vanishes with increase of temperature .",
    "however , the model was extended  @xcite to include fluctuations that can reverse an arrow if it is possible to do so in a current conserving manner .",
    "this can be done by enlarging the configuration space by adding four additional vertices shown as 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "@xcite the vertices corresponding to sources and sinks should have a large negative chemical potential .",
    "the model then belongs to the universality class of the classical six - vertex model .",
    "@xcite including the sources or sinks will convert the problem to the eight - vertex model and the concomitant spacific heat singularity at the pseudogap transition , which is not observed .",
    "the statistical mechanics of @xmath9 classical six - vertex is a solved problem ; the phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "but the dynamics is , to our knowledge , unexplored .",
    "it is indeed the collective dynamics of the model when described in the context of the electronic model appropriate to high temperature superconductors that we wish to study here",
    ".    -vertex model .",
    "the vertices ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are the af vertices which lead to the ddw phase with local orbital moments , while the rest of the vertices lead to longer range current fluctuations . ]    , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the three independent vertex weights discussed there the regions i and ii are orbital ferromagnets ( of ) .",
    "the region iii is the power - law phase and the region iv is the orbital antiferromagnet with ddw order .",
    "the arrow marks a path ( tetragonal symmetry assumed ) from the low temperature to the high temperature phase with the pseudogap transition at @xmath19 . ]    given that the order parameter condenses at the wave vector @xmath4 , one would have naively expected that the amplitude collective mode , the analog of the @xmath20 anderson - higgs mode , but in the particle - hole channel , would be peaked at the same wave vector .",
    "an important result of our paper is that the spectra of the amplitude fluctuations of the ddw state are _ not _ confined to only the ordering wave vector @xmath21 , but can have finite - frequency peaks at both @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as well as considerable spectral weight over a substantial region of the momentum space .",
    "in passing we note that the quantum six - vertex model described elsewhere  @xcite can be cast in terms of a continuum action of a @xmath24-vector @xmath25 ) model with cubic anisotropy .",
    "the precise relation of the parameters in this continuum model to the parameters in the quantum six - vertex model is complex , but this mapping is not without merit .",
    "of course at finite temperature it is an effective `` ginzburg - landau '' model that complements the picture in terms of the vertex model .",
    "the isotropic @xmath26 vector model with cubic anisotropy has been extensively studied .",
    "@xcite here we do not pursue this route , but pursue the more microscopic vertex model , which is more convenient to describe the electronic excitations .",
    "to calculate the ddw collective mode spectrum we start with the electronic hamiltonian which has the form , @xmath27 where @xmath28 here we adopt a commonly used dispersion @xmath29 based on local density approximation  @xcite , which is @xmath30 for subsequent notational simplicity , we define the functions , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the band parameters are chosen to be @xmath33 ev , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the difference with the conventional lda band structure is a rough renormalization of @xmath36 ( from @xmath37 ev to @xmath38 ev ) , which is supported by experiments involving angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "[ eq : deltaq ] , as elsewhere , we shall drop the spin - index @xmath39 , as it will play no important role .      for an analysis of the collective modes of the ddw state at a general @xmath40 , we have generalized the gap parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq : deltaq ] . in this form , @xmath41 , for an arbitrary @xmath40 , which implies that the gap parameter is purely real in the real space .",
    "this constraint is necessary to ensure that no gapless phase mode is generated in the collective mode spectrum of the twofold commensurate ddw state which breaks only discrete symmetries @xcite . from eq .",
    "[ eq : deltaq ] it follows that at @xmath23 , @xmath42 represents the conventional ddw gap parameter shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in its vertex representation , while @xmath43 leads to a gap parameter @xmath44 which represents uniform current flow along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions .",

    "these , together with reversal of currents , give the remaining vertices in fig .",
    "finally , at @xmath50 , @xmath51 allows a gap parameter that breaks local current conservation with sites having a current source at one vertex and a current sink in the neighboring vertex .",
    "however , in this paper we will choose the fugacity of these current - conservation violating vertices , which are controlled by the coupling constant @xmath52 in front of the form factors , to vanish  @xcite .",
    "thus the operator @xmath51 represents the full set of current vertices of the six - vertex model .",

    "the intensity at @xmath43 goes down with increasing @xmath99 , but the amplitudes strongly depend on the microscopic parameters , which implies that the amplitude fluctuation spectra can have finite frequency peaks at both wave vectors @xmath43 and @xmath23 , or only a single peak .",
    "such non - universality , commonly unrecognized , indicates that different families of cuprates , or even samples at different hole doping within the same family of cuprates , may have different fluctuation spectra .",

    "this nematic order parameter @xmath144 is a close cousin of the order parameter discussed here .",
    "finally , because the orbital magnetic moment contribution to inelastic neutron scattering is expected to be enhanced at long wavelengths , the relatively small peak at @xmath43 can produce scattering peaks comparable to that at @xmath21 .",
    "however , the detailed kinematics addressing quantitatively the neutron scattering signatures of the amplitude modes will be meaningful once the experiments provide a more detailed picture .",
    "in summary , we calculate the spectrum of the amplitude mode , the analog of the @xmath20 higgs mode , for the commensurate ddw state proposed earlier to explain the anomalous phenomenology of the pseudogap phase of the high-@xmath1 cuprates . to properly take account of the fluctuations of the ddw state we map the ddw fluctuation problem on to the fluctuations of a vertex model , which is the most natural description of the ddw current fluctuations .",
    "our central result is that the amplitude or higgs mode spectrum of the ddw state can be peaked at both wave vectors @xmath3 and @xmath145 , even though the ordered state condenses only at the wave vector @xmath21 .",
    "the emergence of a @xmath43 peak , even with a mean field state that breaks the lattice translation symmetry ( such as the twofold commensurate ddw ) indicates @xmath43 fluctuations are hidden within the ddw state .",
    "we find that these fluctuations reflect an _",
    "orbital ferromagnetic _ ( of ) phase in the six - vertex generalization of the model , as mentioned above . in its phase diagram one finds of as well as orbital antiferromagnetic ( ddw ) phases ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the existence of such striking @xmath43 fluctuations , even in the absence of an of order parameter , can be important in interpreting inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite however , because the response is at higher frequencies , they are subject to considerable degree of non - universality and serves as a warning that if our theory is correct , experimental signatures should not be unique across materials , as well as within a given material , as a function of doping , frequency , etc .    we provide predictions as well as shed important light on the recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite , which evince multiple magnetic excitations at different wave vectors in the pseudogap phase , the origin of which has remained mysterious within the existing theoretical framework of the the pseudogap regime of the cuprates .",
