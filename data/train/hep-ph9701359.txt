    "it has been recently suggested @xcite that theoretical models with one extra @xmath3 whose couplings to quarks and leptons are not of the ` conventional ' type would be perfectly consistent with all the available experimental information from either lep1 @xcite and sld @xcite or cdf @xcite data .",
    "starting from this observation , a detailed analysis has been performed of the detectability in the final two - fermion channels at lep2 of a @xmath2 whose fermion couplings are arbitrary ( but still family independent ) @xcite .",

    "the final two - fermion channel is not the only one where virtual effects generated by a @xmath2 can manifest themselves .",
    "the usefulness of the final @xmath4 channel in @xmath5 annihilation to obtain improved information on some theoretical properties of such models , has already been stressed in previous papers in the specific case of longitudinally polarized beams for models of ` conventional ' type ( e.g. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , _ etc . _ ) , showing that the role of polarization in these cases would be essential @xcite .",
    "the effects of a @xmath2 of ` unconventional ' type in the @xmath4 channel have also been considered , and compared with those of models with anomalous gauge couplings in ref .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown that the benchmark of the model with a @xmath2 would be the existence of a peculiar connection between certain effects observed in the @xmath4 channel and other effects observed in the final lepton - antilepton channel .",
    "the aim of this paper is that of considering whether the search for _ indirect _ effects of a ` unconventional ' @xmath2 in the @xmath4 channel would benefit from the availability of longitudinal polarization of initial beams , as it is the case for the ` conventional ' situation .",
    "we shall show in the next sect .",
    "2 that this is indeed the case , i.e. , that in the parameter space the expected experimental sensitivity in the polarized processes is by far better than in the unpolarized case . for what concerns the differentiation from other sources of nonstandard effects , in particular those with anomalous gauge couplings",
    ", we shall also show in sect .",
    "3 that the characteristic feature of such a @xmath2 would be the existence of certain peculiar properties of different observables , all pertaining to the final @xmath4 channel .",
    "all our discussions assume that longitudinal lepton polarization will be available in the considered examples . in practice",
    ", this would be feasible at the future planned @xmath0 linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "our conclusions for the specific cases that we consider , as summarized in sect .",
    "4 , will therefore be strongly in favour of polarization",
    ". an appendix will be devoted to the derivation of several expressions for the relevant experimental observables .",
    "the starting point of our analysis will be the expression of the invariant amplitude for the process @xmath8 in born approximation , this can be written as a sum of a @xmath9-channel and of an @xmath10-channel component . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "case , the latter will be written as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath10 and @xmath12 are the total c.m . squared energy and @xmath13 production angle ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the conventional electroweak mixing angle ) ; @xmath20 denotes the electron helicity ( @xmath21 for right / left - handed electrons ) ; finally , @xmath22 is a kinematical coefficient , depending also on the final @xmath23 s helicities . for simplicity",
    "we omit its explicit form , which is not essential for our discussion here , and can be either found in the literature @xcite or easily derived from the entries of tab .  1 in the subsequent sect .",
    "3 , which also shows the form of the @xmath9-channel neutrino exchange . note that , at this stage , we are writing an ` effective ' born approximation that contains both the physical @xmath24 couplings and the physical @xmath24 mass .",
    "we shall systematically ignore extra contributions at one loop .",
    "in fact , our purpose is that of evaluating _ deviations _ from the sm expressions due to one extra @xmath24 . in this spirit",
    ", we shall also consider the @xmath2 contribution using an ` effective ' born approximation with physical @xmath2 couplings and mass .",
    "the more rigorous one - loop treatment would require also the calculation of the , potentially dangerous , qed radiation effects whose study has not yet been performed , to our knowledge , for polarized beams at the lc .",
    "we shall assume in the sequel that the results of a rigorous treatment reproduce those of an effective approximation without qed after a suitable , apparatus dependent , calculation as it is the case for the unpolarized case .",
    "then , for the evaluation of the _ deviations _ due to the @xmath2 , the residual purely electroweak one - loop contributions will be safely neglected .    working in this framework , the effective expression of the invariant amplitude after addition of one extra @xmath24",
    "will be written as : @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ amplis1 ] ) , we have retained two possible sources of effects from , respectively , the ` light ' and the ` heavy ' neutral gauge bosons @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in general , in models with two neutral gauge bosons , the ` light ' @xmath24 is formally not identical to the sm @xmath24 and , within the accuracy of experimental data relevant to measurements of the standard @xmath24 parameters , it potentially can have mass and couplings different from the sm prediction . such modifications of the @xmath24 couplings , reflecting the presence of the additional extra @xmath2 , can be induced , e.g. , through the mechanism of @xmath28 mixing . to account for this fact , the ` light ' @xmath24 is now denoted as @xmath26 , and the same convention applies to its couplings @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "thus , the deviations @xmath51 and @xmath52 should be small numbers , to be treated as a perturbation to the sm results , and the same is true for the mass - shift @xmath53 , with @xmath54 if this is due to @xmath55 mixing .",

    ", such effects can arise in specific models due to the presence of new heavy fermions , and their inclusion in the general parametrization of the amplitude deviations from the sm would require a much more complicated analysis , taking into account three different sources of nonstandard effects at the same time ( @xmath2 , lepton mixing and anomalous couplings ) .",
    "although perhaps possible , this is beyond the purpose of this paper .",

    "the possibility to measure ( [ aceplus ] ) strongly depends on the angular resolution for the @xmath23 and its decay products .",
    "another example , which would eliminate both @xmath243 and @xmath235 in eqs .",
    "( [ aeffebi ] ) and ( [ acie ] ) , should be the specific combination : @xmath244    still another possibility could be represented , in principle , by the combination @xmath245 with @xmath246 the total cross section for right - handed electrons and arbitrary @xmath247 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath248 , @xmath240 and @xmath249 can be easily calculated from the formulae given in the appendix . concerning the dependence on the remaining anomalous couplings , in the linear approximation to the @xmath250 ( see eq .  ( a4 ) ) the combination ( [ qminus ] ) depends on @xmath251 , while ( [ pplus ] ) is determined by @xmath241 similar to ( [ aceplus ] ) , but with different parametrical dependence hence with different sensitivities on the anomalous couplings .    in figs .",
    "4 - 6 we depict the statistical significance of the variables ( [ aceplus])-([pplus ] ) as a function of the relevant anomalous couplings .",
    "as anticipated in the previous section , for any observable @xmath252 such significance is defined as the ratio @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 is the statistical uncertainty attainable on @xmath252 .",
    "the different sensitivities to the various couplings @xmath199 and @xmath200 can be directly read from these figures and , as one can see , in certain cases they can be substantial . figs .",
    "4 - 6 are obtained by varying one of the parameters at a time and setting all the other ones at the sm values .    by definition , the observables ( [ aceplus])-([pplus ] ) require 100% longitudinal electron polarization , a situation that will not be fully obtained in practice .",
    "however , the presently planned degree of electron polarization at the nlc , @xmath256 @xcite is high enough that eq .",
    "( [ longi ] ) can represent a satisfactory approximation to evaluate such observables .",
    "clearly , such approximation would be substantially improved if also positron polarization were available , e.g. , @xmath257 @xcite , because in that case in eq .",
    "( [ longi ] ) the coefficient of @xmath246 could be emphasized over that of @xmath258 by a large factor , or viceversa .",
    "moreover , we can remark that the independence of @xmath259 in eq .",
    "( [ qminus ] ) from @xmath213 holds for both @xmath260 cases and , consequently , also for the case of unpolarized beams .    concerning a possible discrimination between the @xmath2 model of sect .  2 and the model considered in this section",
    ", a strategy could be the following .",
    "if a signal is observed in either @xmath66 and/or @xmath67 and also in at least one of the ` orthogonal ' observables defined above , we can conclude that it is due to the model with anomalous gauge couplings , and we can try to derive the values of some of them by properly analyzing the observed effects @xcite . if , conversely , only @xmath66 and/or @xmath67 show an effect , we are left with the possibility that both models are responsible for such deviations .",
    "in this situation , we still have a simple tool to try to distinguish among the two models , which uses the observation that , under the assumption that only @xmath198 and @xmath261 are effective , the expressions of the consequent deviations of the integrated cross sections @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively : @xmath262 and @xmath263 here , both @xmath261 and @xmath198 have been taken nonvanishing , and @xmath264 are the left- and right - handed electron couplings , respectively .",
    "however , recalling that @xmath265 in the case of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings , using the experimental value of @xmath266 , one has for such a model the very characteristic feature @xmath267 where the explicit expressions of @xmath268 and @xmath269 have been used .",
    "if , on the contrary , the effect is due to a model with a @xmath2 , no _ a priori _ relationship exists between @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "accordingly , from inspection of these two quantities , if they are found not to be related by eq .",
    "( [ feature ] ) to a given confidence level , one would conclude that the observed effect should be due to the general extra @xmath24 discussed in sect .",
    "2 . then , depending on the actual values of the experimental deviations , a determination of the two parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 might be carried on .    actually , if the deviations of @xmath272 satisfy the correlation eq .",
    "( [ feature ] ) , a small residual ambiguity would remain . although the possibility that in a model with both @xmath70 and @xmath71 nonvanishing the correlation eq .",
    "( [ feature ] ) is satisfied just by chance seems rather unlikely , one can not exclude it _ a priori_. should this be the real situation , further analysis , e.g. , in the different final fermion - antifermion channel would be required .",
    "the discussion of this essentially unlikely case can be performed , but is beyond the purpose of this paper .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the availability of longitudinal electron beam polarization at the lc would be very useful for the study of the most general model with one extra @xmath24 from an analysis of the final @xmath4 channel . in principle",
    ", it would also be possible to discriminate this model from a rather ` natural ' competitor one where anomalous gauge boson couplings are present .",
    "this could be done by analyzing suitable experimental variables , all defined in the same @xmath4 final channel .",
    "the interesting property of polarized observables in the @xmath4 channel should be joined to analogous interesting features that are characteristic of polarization asymmetries in the final two - fermion channel , whose general discussion has been presented recently @xcite .",
    "all these facts allow us to conclude that polarization at the lc would be , least to say , a highly desirable opportunity .",
