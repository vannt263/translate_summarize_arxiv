    "observation of the neutrinoless ( 0@xmath6 ) double beta ( @xmath7 ) decay and/or dark matter particles would be extraordinary events for the modern physics .",
    "it is because both the phenomena are related to the new physical effects beyond the standard model of the particle theory .",
    "the great interest to the @xmath8 decay searches @xcite have arisen from the recent evidence of neutrino oscillations , strongly suggesting that neutrinos have nonzero mass .",
    "while oscillation experiments are sensitive to the neutrinos mass difference , only the measured @xmath8 decay rate could establish the majorana nature of the neutrino and give the absolute scale of the effective neutrino mass .",
    "several sensitivity studies of the @xmath7 decay processes were performed using low background crystal scintillators , which contain various candidate nuclei : @xmath9ca @xcite , @xmath10ca @xcite , @xmath11cd @xcite , @xmath12cd , @xmath13cd and @xmath14cd @xcite , @xmath15ce and @xmath16ce @xcite , @xmath17gd @xcite , @xmath18w and @xmath19w @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the experiment @xcite with the cadmium tungstate ( cdwo@xmath1 ) scintillators enriched in @xmath14cd the very low counting rate of 0.04 counts/(yr@xmath20kev@xmath20 kg ) was reached in the energy window @xmath21 mev .",
    "the half - life limit on @xmath8 decay of @xmath14cd was set as @xmath22 yr at 90% cl , which leads to one of the strongest restriction on the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath23 ev .",
    "there are strong evidence for a large amount of dark matter in the universe ( matter which reveals itself only through gravitational interaction ) . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp )  in particular neutralino , predicted by the minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ",
    "are considered as one of the most acceptable component of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "these particles can be detected due to their scattering on nuclei producing low energy nuclear recoils .",
    "extremely low counting rate and small energy of recoil nuclei are expected in experiments to search for the wimp .",
    "therefore , the experiments for direct wimp search require extremely low level of background ( less than several events per kilogram per day per kev ) with very low energy threshold ( less than tens kev ) .    direct methods of wimp detection are based on registration of ionization or / and excitation of recoil nucleus in the material of the detector itself . at present , most sensitive experiments apply different detectors for wimp search : ge semiconductor detectors @xcite , bolometers @xcite , scintillation detectors @xcite . an interesting possibility to reject background caused by electrons provides cryogenic technique , which uses simultaneous registration of heat and charge @xcite or heat and light signals @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite calcium tungstate crystals ( cawo@xmath1 ) are discussed as promising material for such a kind of dark matter detector . however , radioactive contamination of cawo@xmath1 crystals used in @xcite , as well as investigated in @xcite , is too high for low counting measurements .",
    "the purpose of our work was investigation of scintillation properties and radioactive contamination of zinc tungstate ( znwo@xmath1 ) crystals as possible detectors for the double beta decay and dark matter experiments .",
    "three clear , slightly colored znwo@xmath1 crystals ( @xmath24 mm , @xmath25 mm , and @xmath26 mm ) were used in our studies .",

    "the dependence of the @xmath60 ratio on energy and direction of @xmath58 beam relatively to the crystal planes ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is similar to that observed with cdwo@xmath1 scintillators @xcite .",
    "as the quenching of the scintillation light caused by @xmath58 particles ( in comparison with electrons ) is due to the higher ionization density of @xmath58 particles , such a behaviour of the @xmath60 ratio can be explained by the energy dependence of ionization density of @xmath58 particles @xcite .",
    "the time characteristics of znwo@xmath1 scintillators were studied as described in @xcite with the help of a transient digitizer based on the 12 bit adc ( ad9022 ) operated at the sample rate of 20  ms / s .",
