    "the mass of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is a fundamental parameter of galaxies . among the dynamical tracers",
    "used to measure the smbh mass directly ( e.g. from gas or stars ) , 22 ghz h@xmath5o megamasers provide the most precise mass estimates outside of our galaxy .",
    "as first demonstrated in the archetypal maser galaxy ngc 4258 ( greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ; miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , maser features in such systems trace an edge - on , thin keplerian disk on sub - parsec scales around the central smbh and the enclosed mass can be constrained to @xmath6% ( humphreys et al .",
    "such disk masers are usually detected in seyfert 2 galaxies , where the nuclear disk is edge - on and maser emission is beamed into our line - of - sight ( los ) .    over the last two decades ,",
    "disk - maser galaxies have emerged as an important sample for high - precision measurement of smbh mass , thanks to large surveys ( e.g. braatz et al . 1996 ; 1997 ; greenhill et al . 2003 ; braatz et al . 2004 ; kondratko et al . 2006 ; braatz & gugliucci 2008 ) . in particular , new maser disks are being discovered and mapped by the megamaser cosmology project ( mcp , reid et al . 2009 ; braatz et al . 2010 ) , which ultimately aims to use the maser disks to determine the hubble constant @xmath7 to better than 3% uncertainty .",
    "so far , the mcp has published 7 high - accuracy smbh masses ( kuo et al .",
    "including results from other groups ( herrnstein et al .",

    "the smbh mass results can be used to investigate the m @xmath3 @xmath8 relation , as has been done by greene et al .",
    "( 2010 ; 2016 ) .",
    "the masses derived from maser galaxies are between 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath10 and occupy the less - explored lower - mass end of the m @xmath3 @xmath8 plot . currently maser galaxies fall below the empirical m @xmath3 @xmath8 relation ( e.g. mcconnell & ma 2013 ) . as discussed in greene et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and listed in kormendy & ho ( 2013 ) , many of the host galaxies of maser disks have pseudo - bulges rather than classical bulges , suggesting that galaxies with pseudo - bulges may follow a different m @xmath3 @xmath8 relation than galaxies with classical bulges .",
    "as the disk maser sample grows , we could better test whether disk masers are always seen in systems with 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10 smbhs and whether maser galaxies with classical bulges follow the empirical m @xmath3 @xmath8 relation .",
    "some galaxies show maser profiles that differ from the  classical \" triple sets of lines characteristic of maser disks . these more complicated systems may harbor outflows ( e.g. circinus ; greenhill et al .",
    "2003 ; ngc 3079 ; kondratko et al . 2005 ; ) and jets ( e.g. ngc 1068 ; greenhill et al .",
    "though they are less studied compared to disk masers , as more are imaged , they may become an important sub - sample to study the outflows and interactions of the central agn with its environment .",
    "here we present high - resolution vlbi images and rotation curves of 5 new maser galaxies : j0437 + 2456 , eso 558@xmath3g009 , ngc 5495 , mrk 1029 , and ngc 1320 .",
    "the first three have spectral profiles indicative of `` classical '' keplerian disk masers , while the last two have profiles suggesting more complicated nuclear structure ( e.g. pesce et al . 2015 ) .",

    "we describe our observations and data reduction in section 2 .",
    "then section 3 shows the vlbi images and the rotation curves , followed by our analysis of the smbh masses on each source . using these results , in section 4 , we define a sample of 15 `` clean '' disk masers and explore the relation between maser disk radius , smbh mass and agn luminosities",

    "ngc 5495 and ngc 1320 , we conducted the observations using a `` self - calibration '' strategy , in which we remove atmospheric phase fluctuations using a strong , narrow maser line from the target maser galaxy .",
    "two `` geodetic blocks , '' bracketing the maser observations were used to calibrate the tropospheric delay and clock errors at each antenna .",

[ fig : gbtspec ] as the horizontal solid lines below the gbt spectra .",
    "we observed a nearby delay calibrator about every 50 minutes to calibrate the single band delay , and a bandpass / fringe - finder source was observed twice in each track .",
    "our data were recorded with the mark 5b recording system ( a.k.a the vlba legacy system ) with the maximum recording rate of 512 mbit  s@xmath12 and maximum bandwidth of each baseband limited to 16 mhz .    for  self - calibration \" observations , to map the maser distribution optimally and derive the best smbh mass , an accurate absolute position of the reference feature is needed .",
    "a large offset between the true absolute position and the position used in vlbi correlation will introduce a significant phase error that varies with observed frequency , contributing an additional positional uncertainty for each maser spot , distorting our final map and affecting the measured warping in the position angle ( p.a . )",
    "direction ( gao et al . 2016 ) .",
    "typically an absolute position accuracy of @xmath14 10 mas is sufficient in our mcp observations .",
    "otherwise the systematic errors resulting from this effect should also be considered ( see section 3.3 for more details ) .",
    "we conducted a phase - referenced vlbi observation of j0437 + 2456 to measure the absolute position of the maser .",
    "we observed an external calibrator j0435 + 2532 ( 0.70@xmath15 away ) every 70 seconds to remove the atmospheric phase variations .",
    "we followed the data reduction process for phase - referencing observations as described in reid et al .",
    "finally we derived the sky position of the peak maser emission at velocity 4495.38 km  s@xmath12 , to be at ra= @xmath16 and dec= @xmath175606\".837 , with uncertainties of 1.3 mas and 2 mas respectively .",
    "we used this position for data correlation in the subsequent `` self - cal '' tracks .    for eso 558@xmath3g009",
    ", we used the vla in b configuration to measure the maser position ra= @xmath18 and dec= @xmath193519\".948 with uncertainties of 33 mas and 64 mas , respectively , prior to our vlbi observations .",
    "to better constrain the maser position , we conducted a phase - referenced vlbi observation ( bb313af ) in which an external calibrator j0702 - 1951 ( 1.77@xmath15 away ) was observed every other minute .",
    "however , due to the relative weakness of the peak maser line intensity ( @xmath20 40 mjy , measured from the gbt single dish spectrum taken within one month to the vlbi observation ) , and phase de - coherence in the phase transfer from j0702 - 1951 to eso 558@xmath3g009 , we were unable to detect the signal from eso 558@xmath3g009 .",
    "so we applied the vla position of eso 558@xmath3g009 for vlbi correlation .",
    "because of the relatively low intensity of maser lines in j0437 + 2456 ( with peak intensity usually less than 50 mjy ) , the majority of `` self - cal '' tracks for j0437 + 2456 were conducted between 2013 and 2014 ( with 3 tracks presented here ) , when we could include the phased - vla in our observation array , boosting our sensitivity by @xmath21% . during observations , we `` phased - up '' all of the vla antennas prior to each vlbi scan .",
    "this was done by observing j0435 + 2532 ( @xmath22 140 mjy , 0.7@xmath15 away from j0437 + 2456 ) for 1 min . to minimize decorrelation",
    ", we set the maximum vlbi scan length to be 10 mins with the vla in b- or c - configuration .",
    "we also added a flux calibration scan for the vla to get the combined system temperature for the phased array .",
    "we used the mark 5c recording system , which offers a maximum recording rate of 2 gbit  s@xmath12 , enabling us to cover the entire maser spectrum with two 128 mhz bands ( @xmath23 km s@xmath12 for each band ) in dual polarization and 2-bit sampling . in order to obtain high spectral resolution for the maser data , we re - correlated 16 mhz portions of these broad bands with the new zoom - band mode offered in the difx software correlator ( deller et al .",
    "[ fig : gbtspec ] shows the velocity coverage of the zoom - bands for j0437 + 2456 as horizontal dashed lines below the gbt spectrum . for comparison ,",

    "for the self - calibration tracks , we followed the data reduction process described in reid et al .",
    "the typical solution interval used in calib varied between 1 and 2 minutes , depending on the coherence times in each track .    for j0437 + 2456 , before the final imaging step , we averaged the ( _ u , v _ ) data to 1.4 km s@xmath12 per channel ( 100 khz ) to match the typical spectral linewidths from the single - dish spectrum . after we made images for tracks bb321x0 , bb321x1 and bb321x4 separately , we combined the data before imaging , assuming that the strongest feature at 4496.15 km s@xmath12 did nt change its position . since we observed the tracks within a month ,",

    ", we plot the color - color  wedge \" that luminous agn may fall in ( mateos et al .",
    "2012 ) and the empirical mid - infrared criterion for agn identification , which is w1-w2 of 0.8 ( stern et al .",
    "2012 ) , in dotted line .",
    "clearly most of our disk maser galaxies do not fall in the wedge nor do they lie above the w1-w2 of 0.8 line .",
    "this is not surprising as the completeness of the color - color wedge selection is a strong function of x - ray luminosity , as stated in mateos et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . below 10@xmath89",
    "erg s@xmath12 , where all nine disk maser galaxies with published x - ray measurements are located ( masini et al .",
    "2016 , castangia et al .",
    "2013 ) , the wise color - color wedge only selects less than 20% of type 2 agn ( mateos et al .",
    "2012 ) . the majority of disk maser galaxies in our sample have w2-w3 between 2 and 3 , and w1-w2 near zero . comparing with the color - color diagram for different types of sources as shown in yan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we see our wise luminosities may have contamination from star formation and we can not distinguish that from agn emission .",
    "nevertheless , our logic here is that if we can see any correlations between the  star formation contaminated `` wise luminosity and maser disk properties ( e.g. inner and outer radius ) , then such correlation should be strengthened when the intrinsic luminosity from the agn has been used instead , as star formation activities should not affect the generation of maser emission .",
    "so we plot the inner and outer maser disk radii against the wise band 3 luminosity measured from both the peak pixel and 5.5 '' aperture in the middle and bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : lvsr ] , respectively .",
    "these plots suggest a correlation between the outer disk radius and the wise luminosity , both in the peak pixel data and the 5.5 \" aperture data . here",
    "we calculate the spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath79 as a non - parametric test , giving 0.83 with the two - tail probability of 0.0001 for both cases .",
    "such a high coefficient suggests a positive correlation .",
    "in contrast , no clear correlation is found between the inner disk radius and the wise luminosity .",
    "the calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficient is 0.53 with the p - value of 0.04 , which disfavor a correlation .    to better characterize the correlation between the outer radius and the wise luminosity , here we fit the data in the the form of @xmath90 .",
    "similar to the previous section , here we assign a 10% uncertainty for the disk radius in each galaxy , which gives equal weighting for all galaxies in the fitting .",
    "this would avoid ngc 4258 dominant the fitting and yields results with unreasonably high confidence levels .",
    "the best - fit results using the peak pixel data is : @xmath91    the fit from the wise 5.5 \" aperture data is consistent with that from the peak pixel data .",
    "however , both fits are strongly influenced by a small number of data points at the low and high ends of the luminosity distribution .",
    "we show the results on the middle and bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lvsr ] .",
    "we also calculate @xmath79 between the maser disk size and both the absorption - corrected 2 - 10 kev luminosity and [ o iii ] luminosity , though they are all less than 0.5 , suggesting no evident correlation .",
    "we show these results in fig .",
    "[ fig : lvsr2 ] . to investigate further , here",
    "we compare the 2 - 10 kev luminosity and [ o iii ] luminosity against wise luminosity in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcomp ] . in general",
    ", there is a good consistency between the x - ray data and wise data , though the small number of available x - ray measurements prevents a more systematic comparison .",
    "as for the [ o iii ] data , the overall offset and scatter may reflect the uncorrected reddening , as only galactic absorption has been corrected in the [ o iii ] data here .",
    "masini et al .",
    "( 2016 ) also compared the inner and outer radii of maser disk in a sample of 14 maser galaxies to the x - ray 2 - 10 kev luminosity measured from the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) , and they did nt find a correlation neither . though we note that several `` non - clean '' disk masers have been included in their study ( e.g. ngc 1068 , ngc 1386 , ngc 3079 , ngc 4945 and circinus ) .",
    "besides , the x - ray luminosities we used here are measured by either xmm or chandra at the wavelength roughly between 0.1 and 10 kev , whereas nustar covers the higher energy band between 3 to 79 kev , which is less sensitive to absorption and thus not good coping with absorption corrections . nevertheless , our current result and results from masini et al .",
    "( 2016 ) do not suggest the existence of correlation between maser disk size and x - ray luminosity . considering the good consistency between the x - ray data and wise data we mentioned above",
    ", a larger sample of disk masers with x - ray measurements would be better to verify the correlation between maser disk size and agn luminosity here .",
    "one way to interpret the r@xmath92-l@xmath93 correlation is that since we see a tentative correlation between maser disk size and smbh mass ( as in previous section ) , and it is well known that smbh mass correlates with galaxy bulge mass ( e.g. kormendy & ho 2013 ) , which can convert to bulge luminosity .",
    "so we might expect a correlation between maser disk size and mid - infrared luminosity , if it contains luminosity from both the agn and the galaxy bulge .",
    "however , this interpretation might not hold true , since we also see a correlation between r@xmath94 and smbh mass but we do nt see a strong correlation between r@xmath94 and l@xmath93 here .",
    "as we ve derived in the appendix , if the outer radius of the maser disk is constrained by the molecular gas kinematic temperature as it approaches @xmath95 400 k , the slope derived between r@xmath92 and mid - infrared luminosity should be 0.5 , with an intercept of 22.18 .",
    "our current best - fit result is consistent with such a slope and intercept , but a larger sample of clean disk maser galaxies are needed to verify the result .",
    "in addition , higher - resolution than the 7.4 \" for wise band 3 are needed to eliminate contamination from star formation and stars in the host galaxy and verify the correlation .",
    "we present high - resolution vlbi observations of five new maser systems : j0437 + 2456 , eso 558@xmath3g009 , ngc 5495 , mrk 1029 and ngc 1320 . the maser systems in j0437 + 2456 , eso 558@xmath3g009 and ngc 5495 clearly delineate edge - on maser disks and we measure their central black hole masses by fitting a keplerian curve to their rotation profiles .",
    "the best - fit smbh mass results are ( 2.9 @xmath0 0.3 ) @xmath1 for j0437 + 2456 , ( 1.7 @xmath0 0.1 ) @xmath2 for eso 558@xmath3g009 , and ( 1.1 @xmath0 0.2 ) @xmath2 for ngc 5495",
    ".    the maser spectrum in mrk 1029 does not show a typical disk maser configuration , though the vlbi data could be fitted by the disk model , from which we get the smbh mass of ( 1.64 @xmath0 0.45 ) @xmath1 .",
    "future vlbi observations that detect maser features at higher rotation velocities could confirm the disk model .",
    "for ngc 1320 , the maser distribution presents a more complicated picture .",
    "some of the maser spots may trace outflowing gas while others may come from a disk .",
    "our data do not provide a robust black hole mass in this case .",
    "the preliminary smbh mass under the keplerian disk model is ( 5.3 @xmath0 0.4 ) @xmath1 .    with these new measurements ,",
    "we define a new sample of vlbi - confirmed `` clean '' maser disks and we use this sample to investigate relationships between maser disk size , black hole mass , and agn luminosity .",
    "relating maser disk radii to the smbh mass , our new measurements together with other works confirm the empirical upper envelope of @xmath4 reported in wardle & yusef - zadeh ( 2012 ) .",
    "we use currently available x - ray 2 - 10 kev measurements , [ o iii ] measurements , and wise 10 @xmath86 m measurements as indicators for the agn luminosity for the disk maser sample and identify a possible correlation between maser disk outer radii and wise luminosity with a high spearman s rank coefficient of 0.8 .",
    "we do not see similar correlations with x - ray 2 - 10 kev luminosity or [ o iii ] luminosity data .",
    "if confirmed , this correlation suggests that the outer radius of maser disk is determined by the molecular gas kinetic temperature approaching @xmath95 400 k , which is essential for pumping water masers .",
