    "a significant challenge in the theory of strongly coupled coulomb systems is to describe how many - body correlations affect transport properties .",
    "much progress has been made using particle simulations , such as molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo , but there is still a critical need for theory that can provide insights into the underlying physical processes , as well as provide expressions for transport coefficients that can be incorporated into macroscopic ( i.e. , fluid ) descriptions .",
    "we recently proposed the effective potential transport theory @xcite , which is a physically motivated extension of traditional plasma theories based on the chapman - enskog or grad fluid expansions .",
    "our previous work showed that this method provides an accurate extension into the strongly coupled regime by comparing the theoretical predictions with md simulations of the one - component plasma ( ocp ) .",
    "the present paper shows that the theory provides a similar extension when applied to the yukawa ocp model over a range of screening parameters ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the basic concept underlying the effective potential theory is that binary scattering events do not occur in isolation , but are instead influenced by the surrounding medium . although the basis is a binary collision picture , a judicious choice of the effective interaction potential allows for key features of many - body correlations to be included . in some sense",
    "the effective potential concept is standard in plasma physics because screening caused by polarization is always required to avoid unphysical divergences associated with the infinite range of the bare coulomb potential .",
    "although the conventional derivations introduce the truncation in the impact parameter , rather than the interaction potential , these are equivalent in the weakly coupled limit  @xcite .",
    "strongly coupled plasmas require account of many - body correlations in addition to screening  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the potential of mean force contains essential features of many - body correlations that enables this approach to extend into the strong coupling regime .",
    "the potential of mean force is the potential obtained when taking two particles at fixed positions and averaging over the positions of all other particles .",
    "this paper extends the previous tests to the yukawa ocp model by comparing with md simulations of self diffusion and viscosity over a range of screening parameters .",
    "it also provides a comparison with other theoretical approaches applied to positron - ion temperature relaxation .",
    "the effective potential theory is based on the boltzmann collision operator , but where the scattering cross section is calculated from the effective interaction potential , @xmath1 , between species @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for application in the chapman - enskog or grad near - equilibrium expansions",

    "the comparison shows a similar range of coupling parameters over which the effective potential approach provides an accurate approximation as was found for self - diffusion .",
    "however , beyond this range the disagreement between theory and simulation is much larger for viscosity than self - diffusion .",
    "in particular , the theory does not capture the viscosity minimum .",
    "the reason for this is that although the caging aspect affects both transport processes , viscosity has additional elements that are not captured by the binary collision picture in the very strongly coupled regime .",
    "namely , whereas diffusivity is determined entirely from particle momenta , viscosity has components from both particle momenta and electrostatic potential .",
    "since the binary collision picture only considers the particle momenta , it captures only the kinetic contribution to viscosity .",
