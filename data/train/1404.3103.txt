    "these oscillations become anticorrelated which enables direct acoustic programming of the qd charge configuration , emission intensity and emission wavelength .",
    "we compare the observed emission characteristics of the qd to numerical calculations of the spatio - temporal carrier dynamics in the qw induced by the saw and find that the observed modulations arise from enhancements of the electron ( @xmath3 ) and electron - hole- ( @xmath3-@xmath4- ) pair concentrations at the position of the qd .",
    "the nws studied here were grown by solid - source molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) in a self - catalyzed growth process on a silicon substrate.@xcite under the selected growth conditions , these nws exhibit predominant zincblende ( zb ) phase but with twin defects and short segments of wurtzite ( wz ) crystal structure .",

    "we identify the emission of the nw core at the lowest photon energies .",
    "it consists of a characteristic double peak structure.@xcite the high energy peak at @xmath23 arises from exciton recombination in zb regions of the nw core .",
    "the low energy peak at @xmath24 stems from recombination of spatially indirect excitons of reduced binding energy for which @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s are localized in zb and wz segments , respectively .",

    "the qw emission peak consists of a series of sharp emission lines .",
    "these characteristics are indicative of a disordered qw with pronounced exciton localization which for planar qws occurs due to local qw thickness fluctuations @xcite . in addition to this established and dominant type - i contribution to the qd confinement",

    "we want to note at this point , that this confinement energy is significantly smaller than that for self - assembled qds and their two - dimensional wetting layer .",
    "the close examination in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) shows that it consists of three sharp emission lines .",
    "we attribute the dominant emission line at @xmath28 to recombination of the neutral exciton , @xmath29 and the two weaker signatures at @xmath30 and @xmath31 to the positive , @xmath32 , and negative trion , @xmath33 , respectively . at this point",
    "our assignment is based on ( i ) the observed renormalization energies consistent with the values reported for ifqds in planar qws @xcite and ( ii ) the optical excitation power dependence of the emission intensities.@xcite the latter is plotted in double - logarithmic representation in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( c ) to identify the underlying power law dependencies .",
    "clearly , the line assigned to @xmath34 and @xmath35 exhibits the smallest slope of 0.8 and 1.0 , consistent with a single excitonic nature .",
    "in contrast , @xmath36 exhibits a larger slope of 1.45 which could be indicative for a charged exciton or the biexciton .",
    "our excitation power dependent spectroscopy does not show signatures of higher confined shells .",
    "the observed broadening most likely arises from interactions of the confined exciton species with free or localized carriers in the surrounding qw .",
    "thus , higher charged exciton species , which require carriers populating higher shells can be excluded .",
    "moreover , the qd emissions shows a weak ( @xmath37 ) _ blueshift _ with increasing excitation power which points towards the presence of an additional contribution of a type - ii band alignment due to polytypism .",

    "we employ weak optical pumping which is crucial for these experiments for three reasons : ( i ) the resulting low charge carrier densities in the qw and nw core do not significantly screen the saw - induced electric fields driving the spatio - temporal carrier dynamics .",
    "the maximum number of ( ii ) excitons and ( iii ) excess @xmath3 s captured by the qd is limited to 1 . in fig .",

    "both emission lines observed in the data , @xmath34 and @xmath36 , exhibit clear sinusoidal spectral modulations due to the dynamic strain field of the saw .",
    "this strain field and its corresponding hydrostatic pressure @xmath40 tunes the qd emission due to deformation potential coupling @xcite . at such low acoustic amplitudes",
    "the contribution of saw - induced lateral electric fields are weak @xcite and the observed spectral shift is dominated by the strain contribution .",
    "@xcite the extracted relative spectral tuning @xmath41 of @xmath34 and @xmath36 are plotted as a function of @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( b )",
    ". clearly , the modulations of both emission lines are in phase and exhibit similar amplitudes .",
    "this is expected because the underlying deformation potential coupling modulates the effective bandgap with a weaker contribution arising from a perturbation of the single particle wavefunctions .",
    "@xcite the observed spectral shifts correspond to @xmath42 @xcite . taken together ,",
    "the maximum ( minimum ) emission energies are observed for the value of @xmath38 at which @xmath43 is maximum positive ( negative ) . for the crystal cut of our @xmath8 substrate we can derive the @xmath38-dependence of the saw - induced modulation of the conduction ( cb ) and valence band ( vb ) within the gaas nw using finite element modeling ( fem ) @xcite which",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath44 ( i.e. time of photoexcitation ) and @xmath45 at which the band modulation is translated spatially due to the propagation of the saw . using",
    "this calibration reveals that the weak suppression ( enhancement ) of the @xmath34 @xmath46 emission occurs for stroboscopic excitation in between the stable @xmath47 and unstable @xmath48 points for @xmath3 s in the cb and for which the @xmath3-drift is anti - parallel to the saw propagation and wavevector @xmath49 .",
    "thus , as the saw propagates , @xmath3 s are effectively _ transported back _ to the position of the qd and increase the net @xmath3-density which in turn _ reduces _ the probability of the qd being occupied by @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the saw effectively induces a anti - correlated rocking motion for @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s which is weak at the applied small band edge modulation .",
    "this picture does not take into account the _ finite _ length of the nw . before presenting detailed experimental and numerical results of the saw control of the qd s occupancy state ,",
    "we want to point out , that we have to take into account the fact that @xmath50 .",
    "this boundary condition limits the spatio - temporal carrier dynamics to a sub-@xmath51 lengthscale , which is in strong contrast to previous experiments performed on planar self - assembled qds and quantum posts @xcite .",
    "the two ends of the nw effectively represent efficient recombination sites for carriers and non - radiatively remove these from the system .",
    "we convert the spatial coordinate along the nw axis @xmath52 to @xmath38 and take into account ( i ) qd position in the center of the nw @xmath53 and ( ii ) @xmath50 .",
    "the latter condition implies that , for a fixed value of @xmath54 , carrier can be transferred without loss by @xmath55 away from the point of photogeneration , i.e. the position of the qd in the center of the nw .",
    "this restriction is indicated by the grey shaded area in figure [ fig:2 ] ( c ) .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ( a ) and the corresponding cb and vb modulations are sketched schematically in the upper parts of each panel . as we increase @xmath61 , the intensity modulations of the dominant @xmath34 and @xmath36 emissions changes dramatically .",
    "most notably , the @xmath62 , the @xmath38-dependence of the @xmath34 and @xmath36 emission intensities are clearly anticorrelated . this anticorrelation provides a direct route to effectively program the occupancy state of the qd simply by tuning @xmath38 at the rf signal generator used to excite the saw .",
    "+ the first striking difference between this data and the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is the pronounced increase of the @xmath36 emission , which is more intense than that of @xmath34 .",
    "this observation confirms an increase of probability to statistically capture and additional @xmath3 due to the saw - induced carrier dynamics analogous to our recent experiments preformed on ingaas qds on planar substrates @xcite .",
    "we want to note that the qds studied in ref .",
    "@xcite confine a larger number of charges compared to the qd studied here , no indications of higher charged excitons species are observed under the applied weak optical excitations .",
    "this provides further evidence for the assignment of the different emission lines in the experiments presented here .",
    "moreover , the higher intensity of @xmath36 provides direct evidence that this emission line does not arise from @xmath63 recombination which should exhibit at most the same intensity as @xmath34 under the applied pulsed optical excitation scheme .",
    "we continue by addressing a second particularly peculiar feature when comparing the data at these three acoustic amplitudes .",
    "it is the development of a global minimum of the qd emission at @xmath64 . at this local stroboscopic phase",
    "the drift of electrons in the saw - induced electric field is aligned with the saw propagation .",
    "thus , both effects add up and result in an efficient depletion of the @xmath3-concentration at the position of the qd and subsequent loss of this carrier species .",
    "taking into account that @xmath3 s exhibit a larger transport mobility than @xmath4 s , the global minimum of the qd occupancy and emission is indeed expected at this local phase confirming our @xmath38-calibration . as we increase @xmath61",
    ", two prominent effects are observed : ( i ) the @xmath34 emission develops two pronounced maxima at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( ii ) the range of @xmath38 over which @xmath36 is observed focuses to a @xmath67 wide range centered around @xmath68 .",
    "the increase of @xmath36 can be qualitatively understood by an acoustically regulated return of @xmath3 s to the position of the qd as described in the previous section and shown in the schematics of figures [ fig:2 ] ( c ) and [ fig:3 ] ( a ) .",
    "furthermore , at high acoustic amplitudes , the first step of this process , the field - driven transfer of @xmath3 s to their stable cb minimum dominates .",
    "when @xmath38 is tuned to positive values , this minimum shifts outside of the nw .",
    "thus , non - radiative loss of @xmath3 s is enhanced for @xmath69 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) ) corresponds to photogeneration of @xmath3 s at an instable point , the maximum of the cb modulation , while @xmath71 are effectively confined at the stable vb maximum .",
    "the combination of these effects enhance the @xmath3-@xmath4-pair , exciton density at this stroboscopic phase and in turn favours pair - wise capture .",
    "similar reasoning can be applied for @xmath72 at which the exciton formation is expected to be enhanced further since the transfer of @xmath4 s toward their stable point in the vb is comparably slow due to their reduced transport mobility .",
    "this effect leads to the observed formation of @xmath34 in the dot . for @xmath73 the removal of @xmath4 s along the saw propagation direction breaks down ( cf .",
    "schematic in figure [ fig:3 ] ( c ) ) giving rise to a net increase of the @xmath4-density and in turn a reduced probability for forming @xmath36 .",
    "based on these so far qualitative arguments we attribute the preferential formation of @xmath34 to an enhanced ( neutral ) exciton concentration at the position of the qd and the preferential formation of @xmath36 to that of @xmath3 s . before presenting numerical simulations of the underlying saw - driven carrier dynamics",
    "we want to point out that the observed intensity modulations and their dependence on @xmath74 is similar to that observed for planar self - assembled qds @xcite .",
    "the data reported here clearly reproduces the expected @xmath38-dependence of the _ horizontal _ electric field component which is aligned with the nw axis as it is also the case for planar qds and quantum posts .",
    "the combination of these observations provides final evidence for our assignment of the observed emission lines as arising from exciton recombination in an interface fluctuation qd .",
    "+     for low ( a ) , intermediate ( b ) and high ( c ) acoustic amplitudes.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    to confirm that this qualitative picture indeed agrees with the underlying spatio - temporal carrier dynamics , we performed numerical solutions of the semi - classical drift and diffusion processes in the saw - modulated bandstructure .",
    "in contrast to a qw which infinitely extends in the plane as assumed in previous reports @xcite , we take into account the geometry of the nw studied in our experiments .",
    "we account for its finite length @xmath75 and the non - radiative loss of carriers at the open facets at the nw ends by removing carriers arriving at position @xmath76 from the center of the nw @xmath53 . in particular we integrated the calculated @xmath3 , @xmath4 and exciton ( @xmath3-@xmath4-pair ) densities at the qd position over time as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath38-dependence of these time - integrated densities are plotted in figure [ fig:4 ] for low ( a ) , intermediate ( b ) and high acoustic powers ( c ) , as black and orange lines , respectively . for low acoustic powers ( @xmath61 )",
    "the exciton density remains high over the entire range of @xmath38 which is consistent with the overall modulation observed for @xmath34 and also @xmath36 .",
    "in contrast , the calculated @xmath3 density exhibits a clear and broad maximum centered at @xmath77 .",
    "this maximum nicely overlaps with that of @xmath36 observed in the experimental data in figure [ fig:3 ] ( a ) . as we increase the acoustic amplitude in our simulations ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] ( b+c ) ) the exciton density develops a clear double peak structure in good agreement with the experimentally observed maxima of the @xmath34 modulation .",
    "furthermore , also the calculated @xmath3-density modulation sharpens in @xmath38 which reproduces the modulations of @xmath34 in the experimental data .",
    "in addition , an increase of the @xmath3 density with respect to that of excitons with increasing acoustic power is clearly resolved in this simulation data .",
    "this calculated behavior is in good agreement with the experimentally observed increase of the @xmath36 intensity with respect to that of @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] ) . furthermore ,",
    "the @xmath38-dependency of @xmath4 density is anticorrelated to that of @xmath3 providing further evidence for the the preferential formation of _ negatively _ charged excitons . +   the emission lines similar to those reported by heiss _ et al .",
    "_ in @xcite exhibit also a characteristic saw - response @xcite .",
    "this , however , features characteristic differences to that reported here since both the emission center and the driving mechanism are of different nature : ( i ) in ref .",
    "@xcite we identify quantum tunneling as the underlying mechanism and the overall @xmath38-dependence of the remains constant within the experimental resolution as @xmath74 is tuned .",
    "( ii ) this fixed @xmath38-dependence follows the oscillation of the vertical electric field component of the saw which dynamically modulates the tunneling probability of carriers out of randomly distributed , defect - related emission centers localized in the @xmath78 shell to a continuum of states .",
    "both effects are in strong contrast to the data presented here and similar experiments performed for planar qd @xcite and quantum post systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , the calculated tunneling rates using wkb theory indicate that for the radial layer sequence chosen here , _ any type of emission center _ localized in the radial shell",
    "is expected to be depopulated non - radiatively due to quantum tunneling as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and its accompanying supplementary information .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the occupancy state of a nw - based heterostructure qd can be programmed using saw - regulated carrier injection under strictly stroboscopic optical excitation . in our experiments",
    "we observe characteristic intensity oscillation of @xmath34 and @xmath36 as we tune the stroboscopic excitation phase @xmath38 .",
    "the modulation show a characteristic dependence on the acoustic amplitude .",
