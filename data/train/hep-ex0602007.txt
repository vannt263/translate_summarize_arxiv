    "one of the many ways to determine @xmath4  is through the measurement of jet production in dis since the production cross section in leading order of @xmath7 jets ( not counting the proton remnant ) is proportional to @xmath8 . at hera",
    "this measurement is particularly interesting since the hadronic final state is opened up in pseudo - rapidity .",
    "the measurements of jet production cross - section presented here have many points in common which facilitates comparison of the extracted values of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , jets are measured throughout using the longitudinally invariant @xmath9 algorithm in the breit - frame of reference , where in the naive quark parton model the struck quark and the virtual boson collide head - on .",
    "hence , substantial transverse energy @xmath3  in the breit frame stems necessarily from qcd radiation and provides a natural energy scale for the determination of @xmath4 .",
    "in the h1 ( zeus ) inclusive - jet analysis , all jets in dis events with @xmath10  @xmath11(@xmath12  @xmath11 ) are counted if their transverse energy @xmath3  exceeds 7  @xmath1(8  @xmath1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the pseudo - rapidity of each jet in the laboratory frame ( breit frame ) is required to lie between -1.0 and 2.5 ( -2.0 and 1.5 ) in the h1 ( zeus ) analysis .",
    "the inclusive jet cross - section is measured single- and double - differentially in @xmath2  and in @xmath3 , and also differentially in the pseudo - rapidity @xmath13  of the jet in the breit frame ( zeus analysis )  @xcite . for the measurement of dijet and trijet cross - sections",
    "a lower minimal transverse energy of @xmath14  @xmath1  is required in both analyses , and jets in the same pseudo - rapidity interval as for the h1 inclusive jet analysis are considered . in order to ensure infrared - safeness of the qcd predictions for multi - jet cross - sections , the invariant mass of the 2 or 3 jets is required to be above 25  @xmath1 .",
    "the h1 and zeus analyses differ in the kinematic range of the dis events : @xmath15  @xmath11  for h1 and @xmath16  @xmath11  for zeus .",
    "the multi - jet cross - sections are measured differentially in @xmath2   ( h1 ) and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath13(zeus ) , and the ratio @xmath5 of the trijet and the dijet cross - sections is measured as a function of @xmath2  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hmuljetr32 ] )  @xcite .    in all analyses ,",
    "the data are corrected bin - by - bin for detector effects and qed radiation using fully simulated monte carlo events , using leading - order ( lo ) event generators .",
    "the dependence of the detector correction on the different models for parton showering  leading - log parton showers ( as implemented in rapgap and lepto ) and the colour - dipole model ( as implemented in ariadne )  results in a systematic uncertainty of e.g. @xmath17 for the inclusive jet cross - section ( zeus ) .",
    "a systematic error of comparable size stems from the uncertainty of the absolute energy scale of the hadronic calorimeters .",
    "it is evaluated by varying the calorimeter energy scale by @xmath18 for all events and fully resconstructing these ( h1 ) or simply by varying the transverse energy of the jets @xmath3  by @xmath1913% depending on @xmath3  ( zeus ) . typically , this results in an uncertainty of @xmath20 on the inclusive - jet cross - section as measured by zeus and of 1% ( 4% ) on the dijet ( trijet ) cross - section as measured by h1 . other experimental uncertainties , such as systematic errors on the measurement of luminosity or on the reconstruction of the scattered electron , typically contribute to the overall experimental error on a level of 12 per - cent .",
    "the measured jet cross - sections are compared to nlo pqcd predictions calculated using the programs disent ( @xmath21 ) and nlojet++ ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , these codes do not include parton - showering and fragmentation , and deliver cross - section values for parton final states only . in order to compare these calculations to measured data",
    ", a hadronization correction factor is applied to the pqcd predictions as the ratio of the cross - sections for hadron and parton final states as calculated by the above mentioned event generators .",
    "this procedure relies on the assumption that the hadronisation correction is not significantly affected by the difference between lo and nlo parton final states .",
    "the theoretical error on this hadronization correction is estimated by comparing the correction coefficients obtained with the two different models for parton showering .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations at fixed order unavoidably exhibit an explicit dependence on the renormalisation scale @xmath23reflecting the absence of higher orders in the perturbative expansion .",
    "it has been shown in these analyses that the qcd predictions for the discussed jet observables are not very sensitive to the particular choice for @xmath23  and the factorization scale @xmath24  among the possible scales of each event:@xmath2 , @xmath3 , or an arithmetic combination of both , but rather to the absolute value of @xmath23(cf .",
    "[ fig : zincxsctq2 ] ) . in order to assess the theoretical uncertainty on the jet cross - sections and @xmath4  due to missing higher orders",
    ", the renormalization scale @xmath23  is varied .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the particular choice of varying @xmath23  up and down factor of 2 is a mere convention - that is followed in the presented analyses - but has no theoretical motivation .",
    "for the inclusive jet cross - section ( e.g. zeus ) , the uncertainty resulting from the renormalization scale dependence ( @xmath25 ) dominates over the other contributions , e.g parametrization of the proton pdf ( @xmath26 ) , to the overall error of the pqcd prediction .",
    "this is also true for the multi - jet cross - sections ( e.g. h1 ) : predicted cross - section for dijets ( trijets ) vary by as much as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) with @xmath23  whereas the uncertainty from the hadronization correction is @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the lower part of figure  [ fig : zincxsctq2 ] demonstrates the good agreement of the nlo pqcd prediction with the measured inclusive jet cross - section ( zeus ) as it drops over five orders of magnitude on a wide range in @xmath2 .",
    "theory and experiment are compatible within experimental error which are generally smaller than the estimated theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the good agreement holds for the multi - jet rates and their ratio as well , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : hmuljetr32 ] except at very high @xmath2  where electro - weak effects are not accounted for in the nlo pqcd programs .",
    "the strong coupling constant is determined by fitting the pqcd predictions as a function of @xmath4to the measured values of the jet observables , i.e. the cross - section value in a particular bin in @xmath2   or @xmath3  or the ratio @xmath5 . in practice ,",
    "the pqcd prediction for each observable is parametrised as a second order polynomial in @xmath4  ( with vanishing constant term ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hincjetas ] shows the running @xmath31 as extracted from the differential inclusive jet cross - section in @xmath3  ( h1 ) , and the corresponding value evolved to the z@xmath32-boson mass . by simultaneously fitting the observables over the range where they are well described by pqcd , and also taking partial correllations of systematic experimental and theory errors into account ,",
    "an @xmath33-measurement is extracted for each of the four analyses :       for the same observable , both experiments obtain almost identical values of @xmath33 with slightly lower values and higher experimental error for a measurement using @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath33  values obtained from different observables , agree well with each other , with an average of previous hera measurements from inclusive dis and jet data  @xcite ( in which  @xcite is used ) , and also with a world average of @xmath34 as determined by  @xcite at a level of experimental precision competitive with the most precise measurements for jets .",
    "it should be noted that the error from the pqcd calculation is roughly three times higher than the experimental uncertainty for the most precise of these four measurements  @xcite . although the latter could probably be reduced by increased statistics and better understanding of systematical errors , future progress on the overall precision for @xmath4  hinges on an improved estimation of contributions beyond nlo to the pqcd predictions .",
