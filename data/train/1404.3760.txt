    "a major stumbling block to understanding the accretion history of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) over cosmic time is determining the role of obscuration in the demographics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "although unified theories state that type  i and type  ii quasars differ only in orientation ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "this obscured phase persists until the agn grows powerful enough to expel all remaining gas out of the surrounding galaxy , leading to an optically luminous quasar phase .",
    "samples of type i quasars with moderate extinction hosted by merging galaxies provide some support for this scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "again , larger homogeneous samples of obscured quasars , at the peak epoch of bh growth , are needed to statistically address the growth phase of these objects .",
    "finally , some obscuration may occur in a torus near the agn , while some may be due to galaxy - scale dust @xcite .",
    "the torus geometry or porosity may also depend on luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are three exceptions that do not appear in paper i , but were selected in an early version of this work using less stringent and lyman @xmath2 restrictions . in total , we have obtained nir spectra for 12 objects with apo , 10 with magellan , and three additional objects ( plus one repeated object ) with gemini ( table 1 ) . the final 25 targets span the luminosity and redshift range of the full sample .",
    "type  ii quasar candidates were selected for nir spectroscopic observation based on a number of criteria , and the sample is summarized in figure [ fig : redshiftmag ] . since many type  ii quasars in the literature have been found via radio selection , we focused on the majority of targets that are undetected in first ( comprising 98% of the class a sample ; * ? ? ? * ) , although given the limited first sensitivity and the faint uv continua , we can not rule out that many of the non - radio detections are actually radio loud .",
    "we then selected targets in the redshift ranges @xmath35 or @xmath36 , to ensure that the emission lines of interest , h@xmath26 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 ( at low redshift ) , fell into windows of high atmospheric transparency . within these wavelength windows , we further selected windows where none of the strong emission lines coincide with strong sky emission lines . finally , we targeted two interesting targets with multiple velocity components in both the lya and lines (  [ sec : multi ] ) . from the uv spectra alone , we suggested that the observed velocity structure of the civ line was likely due to superposed absorption features ( paper i ) .",
    "another possibility was that the multiple peaks corresponded to multiple physical components , perhaps in the process of forming a new galaxy .",
    "our nir spectra allow a test of these hypotheses .",
    "for the triplespec targets , we additionally imposed a @xmath37band magnitude limit of @xmath38 , such that we could identify targets in the guider ( although occasionally blind offsets were used to place the target in the slit ) . for the fire data , we prioritized fainter targets , down to @xmath39 mag . in cases where multiple targets satisfied these criteria",

    "we extract our targets as unresolved point sources .",
    "ab pairs are differenced to remove airglow emission lines , and then each spectrum is extracted .",
    "extraction positions are determined for each exposure due to occasional drift of the object position from exposure to exposure in the triplespec data , and then all ab pairs are summed ( or median - combined in the case of the gemini spectra ) .",

    "our targets are typically more luminous in _ wise _ by at least an order of magnitude than those in @xcite , but are also typically found at higher redshifts .",
    "the banerji objects are selected from deeper nir photometry and thus comprise somewhat more extincted ( @xmath154 mag ) and more intrinsically luminous objects ( by factors of a few ) at comparable redshifts to ours .",
    "eventually we will be able to compare these samples in the rest - frame uv as well ( glikman , private communication ) .",
    "sources selected in the mid - ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tend to be factors of a few more luminous in the mir and redder than our rest - frame uv selected sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a few quasars with similarly moderate extinction inferred from the rest - frame optical / uv have also been uncovered in x - ray surveys , sometimes with significant obscuring columns in the x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of some of our quasars would allow the relative levels of x - ray and optical / uv obscuration to be assessed .",
    "substantial apparent differences between such obscuration levels are often found , likely owing to the presence of some x - ray absorption within the dust - sublimation radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , each selection method imposes a preferred distribution of reddening and luminosity on the final sample .",
    "@xcite have recently measured a distribution of @xmath155 for luminous _ wise_-selected quasars at @xmath156 .",
    "interestingly , they find two natural breaks in the distribution .",
    "the first is at @xmath157 mag , corresponding roughly to the sources observed here .",
    "they find a second transition at @xmath158 mag .",
    "they postulate that the moderate extinction may arise on galaxy - wide scales while the second transition is due to the orientation of a dusty torus in the nucleus .",
    "perhaps our _ hst_imaging will allow us to distinguish these two scenarios for our candidates ( strauss et al . in prep . ) .",
    "taken altogether , our observations paint a nuanced picture of a mildly - obscured population of high - redshift quasars selected with the boss survey .",
    "how they fit into the broader picture of quasar demographics at this epoch remains to be seen . as a class of objects with obscuration intermediate between type  i and",
    "type  ii sources , they may be at intermediate orientation in a unification picture , or just result from a patchy torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the host galaxy may provide some large fraction of the obscuration , in an evolutionary picture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we may hope to get some clues to their star formation properties from higher s / n nir spectra .",
    "we also have many more boss targets to study ; the sample properties of the targets presented in paper i are heterogeneous , and the faintest targets may yet harbor some bona - fide type ii quasars .",
    "we are also planning to obtain uniform nir imaging , to preferentially select the faintest targets in the rest frame optical , which are most likely to be heavily obscured . combining broad - band sed fitting ,",
    "_ hst _  imaging , spectropolarimetry , and more nir spectroscopy , may provide a more complete picture of the nature of these enigmatic targets .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy of 25 candidate type ii quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey , using triplespec on the apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope , fire at the magellan / baade 6.5 m telescope , and gnirs on gemini . at redshifts of @xmath1 , our nir spectra probe the rest - frame optical region of these targets , which were initially selected to have strong lines of and ly  @xmath2 , with fwhm@xmath32000  km  s@xmath4  from the sdss pipeline . </S>",
    "<S> we use the [ ] @xmath5 line shape as a model for the narrow line region emission , and find that h@xmath2  consistently requires a broad component with fwhms ranging from 1000 to 7500  km  s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the lines also require broad bases , but with considerably narrower widths of @xmath6 to @xmath7  km  s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> estimating the extinction using the balmer decrement and also the relationship in lower-@xmath8 quasars between rest equivalent width and luminosity in the [ ]  line , we find typical @xmath9 values of @xmath10 mag , which naturally explains the attenuated lines relative to h@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that our targets are moderately obscured quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe one unusual object with three distinct velocity peaks in its [ ] spectrum . </S>"
