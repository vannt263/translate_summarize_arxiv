    "brownian motion , that is the fate of a heavy particle immersed in a fluid of lighter particles , is _ the _ prototype of a dissipative system coupled to a thermal bath with infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "the work by einstein in 1905 @xcite has developed a mathematical language to describe the random motion of the particle and has uncovered the fundamental relation between friction , diffusion and the temperature @xmath0 of the bath .",
    "half a century later , this seed had grown into the theory of irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , which governs the relaxation and fluctuations of classical systems near equilibrium . at that time , a new challenge had emerged , the quantum mechanical description of dissipative systems .    in contrast to classical brownian motion , where right from the beginning the work by einstein and smoluchowski @xcite had allowed to consider both weak and strong friction , for a long time , the quantum mechanical theory could handle the limit of weak dissipation only . in this case",
    "the interaction between the  particle \" and the  bath \" can be treated perturbatively and one can derive a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the  particle \" @xcite .",
    "this approach , based on the so  called born and markov approximations , has been very successful in quite a number of fields emerging in the fifties and sixties of the last century , such as nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "roughly , a dissipative quantum system can be characterized by three typical energy scales , an excitation energy @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a characteristic frequency of the system , a coupling energy @xmath3 to the bath , where @xmath4 is a typical damping constant , and the thermal energy @xmath5 . the weak coupling master equation is limited to the region @xmath6 .",
    "this is the case whenever the typical linewidth caused by environmental interactions is small compared to the line separation and the thermal  matsubara \" frequency @xmath7 . on the other hand , the approach will fail for strong damping and/or low temperatures .",
    "the work by feynman and vernon @xcite has shown how to take advantage of the path integral representation of quantum mechanics to derive an expression for the reduced density matrix of the  particle \" as a sum over forward and backward paths , which is valid for arbitrary damping strength and temperature .",
    "these two sets of paths arise from the two time evolution operators in the formal expression for the time ",
    "dependent density matrix @xmath8 \\,w(0)\\ , \\exp[+(i/\\hbar)ht]$ ] , where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the system . in the path",
    "integral representation of the reduced density matrix the influence of the bath emerges as time ",
    "nonlocal terms in the action governing the path probability .",
    "these terms include also a coupling between the forward and backward paths and make it difficult to evaluate the path integral explicitly , although progress can be made in some cases @xcite .    everything becomes simpler in the limits of weak and strong damping . while the former case leads to the master equation approach mentioned above",
    ", the latter case is usually referred to as the smoluchowski limit . in the classical case",
    "this limit is well understood and simplifies matter considerably , since the momentum @xmath10 of a heavily damped particle with position @xmath11 is a slow variable that can be eliminated adiabatically .",
    "it is intuitively clear , that a quantum mechanical theory can not entirely dispose of the variable @xmath10 conjugate to @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , for a classical system with characteristic frequency @xmath2 the roots @xmath12 of the characteristic equation in the undamped case are in the presence of damping turned into @xmath13 for large friction , @xmath14 , this can be approximated by @xmath15 while in the strong friction limit the slow classical dynamics is governed by the small root @xmath16 , quantum mechanics accompanies reduced fluctuation of @xmath11 with enlarged fluctuations of the conjugate variable @xmath10 .",
    "both roots @xmath17 are essential to determine the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "that is why quantum effects are not restricted to the temperature range @xmath18 , rather , in quantities sensitive to fluctuations , quantum effect can manifest themselves in the strong friction limit even up to higher temperatures than in the weak damping limit .",
    "this makes the quantum smoluchowski limit addressed in this article nontrivial .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ qse ]",
    "we shortly review the formulation of dissipation within the path integral formalism and sketch the derivation of the quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse ) @xcite . the second part ( sec .",
    "[ applications ] ) is devoted to three specific applications .",
    "as already pointed out in the introduction the inclusion of quantum dissipation in a non - perturbative way has been established only since the early 80s .",
    "the standard approach @xcite starts from a system+reservoir model @xmath19 with a system part @xmath20 , an environmental part @xmath21 , and a system - bath interaction @xmath22 .",
    "the reservoir ( heat bath ) is mimicked by a quasi - continuum of harmonic oscillators bilinearly coupled to the system .",
    "dissipation appears when one considers the reduced dynamics by properly eliminating the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , one this way regains in the classical limit a generalized langevin equation .",
    "it is thus important to realize that the only restriction associated with the oscillator bath is the gaussian stochastic nature of the environment , which in turn means that the relevant impact of the bath onto the system dynamics is completely determined by the average and the autocorrelation function of the bath force .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the reduced system follows from @xmath23 where @xmath24 describes the initial state of the total system . in the ordinary feynman - vernon theory @xcite this state",
    "is assumed to be a factorizing state , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the bath partition function and @xmath27 ) , so that each one , system and equilibrated bath , lives in splendid isolation at @xmath28 .",
    "while this assumption may be justified in the weak damping / high temperature limit , it certainly fails for moderate to strong friction and/or lower temperatures .",
    "it can be shown explicitly that in the classical limit even the langevin equation is not regained , but differs by initial boundary terms that may persist up to long times . in the strong damping realm considered here , the initial state must be correlated @xcite , i.e.  @xmath29 with preparation operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 acting onto the system degree of freedom only and the total partition function @xmath32 . for transparency , in the sequel we assume these operators to be diagonal in position so that the initial density for a one - dimensional system reads in position representation @xmath33 with the reduced thermal equilibrium density matrix @xmath34 and the coordinate representation @xmath35 of the preparation operators . for a specific initial state , one does not need to know the specific form of these operators ( which may be very complicated ) , but rather chooses the preparation function properly .",
    "the reduced quantum dynamics ( [ sm2 ] ) starting with an initial state ( [ sm3 ] ) is now obtained within the position representation by employing the path integral formalism . since the bath contains harmonic degrees of freedom only , it can be integrated out exactly and one arrives at @xmath36 where the propagating function @xmath37 is a threefold path integral  two in real time , one in imaginary time  over the system degree of freedom only @xmath38 { \\cal d}[q']{\\cal    d}[\\bar{q}]\\ { \\rm e}^{i \\sigma[q , q',\\bar{q}]/\\hbar}\\ , \\label{sm5}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 .",
    "the two real time paths @xmath40 and @xmath41 connect in time @xmath42 the initial points @xmath43 and @xmath44 with fixed end points @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while the imaginary time path @xmath47 runs from @xmath43 to @xmath44 in the interval @xmath48 .",
    "the contribution of each path is weighted with an effective action @xmath49=s_s[q]-s_s[q']+i",
    "\\bar{s}[\\bar{q}]+i \\phi[q , q,',\\bar{q}]$ ] which consists of the actions of the bare system in real and imaginary time , respectively , and an additional interaction contribution ( influence functional ) non - local in time .",
    "the latter one can be written as @xmath50=\\int dz \\int_{z > z ' } dz'\\ \\tilde{q}(z)\\ , k(z - z')\\ , \\tilde{q}(z')+\\frac{i}{2 } \\mu\\int dz \\tilde{q}(z)^2\\label{sm6}\\ ] ] where the ordered time integration is understood along the contour : @xmath51 from @xmath52 , @xmath53 from @xmath54 , @xmath55 from @xmath56 with @xmath57 the effective impact of the bath is completely controlled by the damping kernel @xmath58}{{\\rm      sinh}(\\omega\\hbar\\beta/2)}\\label{sm8}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the spectral density of the environment . as expected @xmath60 coincides with the autocorrelation function of the bath force . in particular , for real times the kernel @xmath61 is related to the macroscopic damping kernel entering the classical generalized langevin equation @xmath62 via @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the classical limit ( @xmath65 is the mass of the brownian particle ) .",
    "the term with @xmath66 in ( [ sm6 ] ) gives a potential renormalization due to shifts of the minima of the bath oscillators by the coupling to the system .",
    "the classical smoluchowski limit is related to a separation of time scales between fast equilibration of momentum and slow equilibration of position . in this way ,",
    "the fokker - planck equation for the phase space distribution can be adiabatically reduced to a smoluchowski equation for the marginal distribution in position space @xcite . for quantum dissipative systems",
    "the expectation is that friction makes the system to behave more classically so that for strong friction the complicated path integral expression ( [ sm4 ] ) simplifies considerably .",
    "this is indeed the case as we have shown recently @xcite . in the sequel",
    "we will briefly collect the main findings and , to keep things as transparent as possible , consider a one - dimensional system only moving in a sufficiently smooth potential field @xmath67 .    ) ( shaded ) . the classical range @xmath68 is simple shaded , the quantum range @xmath69 double shaded.,width=302 ]    a typical damping strength in the long time limit is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the laplace transform of the classical damping kernel @xmath72 . for ohmic friction , @xmath73 , for instance ,",
    "one finds @xmath74 .",
    "the same is true for the more realistic drude damping @xmath75 with cut - off frequency @xmath76 .",
    "now , given a typical frequency @xmath2 of the bare system ( e.g.  its ground state frequency ) by strong damping we then mean ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xmath77 hence , we extend the time scale separation known from the classical smoluchowski range to incorporate the time scale for quantum fluctuations @xmath48 . as we will see , this does not mean , however , that quantum effects are negligible at all , since they are related to matsubara frequencies @xmath78 which can be arbitrarily large .",
    "the idea is now , to evaluate for strong friction @xmath79 the path integral expression ( [ sm4 ] ) on a coarse - grained time scale @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the consequences are the following : ( i ) non - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix are strongly suppressed during the time evolution , ( ii ) the real time part of the kernel @xmath82 becomes local on the coarse grained time scale , and ( iii ) initial correlations described by ( [ sm3 ] ) survive for times of order @xmath83 verifying that factorizing initial states can not be used .    in a first step , this program is applied to calculate the thermal ( unnormalized ) equilibrium density matrix @xmath84 \\ , { \\rm      e}^{i\\bar{\\sigma}[\\bar{q}]/\\hbar}\\label{sr3}\\ ] ] with @xmath85=\\sigma[0,0,{\\bar q}]$ ] .",
    "due to ( i ) the strategy is to invoke a semiclassical type of approximation by assuming self - consistently that @xmath86 remains small on the time interval @xmath48 . in function space",
    "the path integral is then dominated by the contributions of the minimal action paths and gaussian fluctuations around them .",
    "the former ones are determined perturbatively up to corrections of order @xmath87 and its corresponding minimal action ",
    "conveniently expressed in terms of the sum @xmath88 and difference coordinate @xmath89 follows as @xmath90 with @xmath91 note that in @xmath92 the quadratic dependence on @xmath93 originating from the inertia part in the equation of motion and in @xmath94 the cut - off frequency @xmath76 appearing in @xmath71 are essential for the convergence of the corresponding sums .",
    "this reveals a fundamental difference to the classical smoluchowski limit and indicates the importance of quantum fluctuations even for strong friction .",
    "from the above , one observes that @xmath92 measures the typical strength of quantum fluctuations in position and @xmath94 is related ( via the identification @xmath95 ) with the equilibrium variance in momentum @xmath96 . before we discuss further details ,",
    "let us arrive at the complete expression of the thermal equilibrium density matrix .",
    "the remaining gaussian fluctuations around the minimal action paths are treated by switching to matsubara frequency space .",
    "correspondingly , a straightforward calculation provides together with ( [ minac ] ) @xmath97}\\ , \\label{equiden}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes a proper normalization factor , e.g.@xmath98 .",
    "this is the first important result of the strong friction analysis : the equilibrium distribution of a strongly damped quantum system in arbitrary ( sufficiently smooth ) potentials . in particular , for a harmonic oscillator the known result is recovered @xcite . to be specific",
    "we consider drude damping @xmath99 with a high frequency cut - off @xmath100 .",
    "then , the functions @xmath92 and @xmath94 can be expressed in terms of @xmath101 functions @xmath102\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda & \\approx & \\frac{\\hbar}{m\\gamma\\pi } \\left[\\psi\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\nu}\\right)-c+\\frac{\\nu}{\\gamma}\\right ]   \\label{sr4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is euler s constant . in the high temperature limit @xmath104",
    ", one finds @xmath105 and @xmath106 so that the wigner transform of ( [ equiden ] ) reduces to the classical phase space distribution .",
    "the dependence on friction appears for lower temperatures as a genuine quantum effect .",
    "of particular interest is the limit @xmath107 where we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "quantum fluctuations in position are suppressed by friction , not algebraically though , but much weaker .",
    "they also show a nonlinear dependence on @xmath110 meaning that for @xmath107 we work nevertheless in a deep quantum domain .",
    "the same can be seen from the momentum variance which grows with friction to guarantee heisenberg s uncertainty relation . accordingly , as assumed above , off - diagonal elements of the distribution @xmath111 are strongly suppressed with @xmath112 being of order @xmath113 or smaller . concluding this section",
    ", we mention that higher order corrections in @xmath92 are associated with higher than second order derivatives of the potential @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis of the previous section already indicated the strong suppression of off - diagonal elements of the density distribution in thermal equilibrium .",
    "while in principle we could now proceed to study the reduced dynamics in real time for the total distribution @xmath114 @xcite , we concentrate in the sequel on the quantum analog of the classical smoluchowski limit and thus restrict ourselves to the time evolution of its diagonal part , the position distribution @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can show that off - diagonal elements relax to thermal equilibrium with respect to the instantaneous position of the brownian particle on a time scale of order @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "for this purpose it is convenient to introduce sum and difference paths also in real time @xmath116/2\\ , \\ \\ \\ \\ x(s)=q(s)-q'(s)\\label{dyn1}\\ ] ] with corresponding fixed end - coordinates @xmath117 and initial coordinates @xmath118 distributed according to the initial state ( [ sm3 ] ) .",
    "already the classical smoluchowski limit reduces the set of acceptable initial states to those with momenta sufficiently bounded from above . in the quantum domain",
    ", the detailed analysis reveals that the @xmath119-dependence of the preparation function @xmath120 must be sufficiently smooth within the range @xmath121 such that we may put @xmath122 .",
    "now , let us first look at the leading order contribution where quantum fluctuations in position are neglected , i.e.  @xmath123 .",
    "this is expected to lead us back to the classical smoluchowski equation , for @xmath124 though , i.e.  far from the classical limit @xmath104 .",
    "as above , we assume excursions from diagonality , encoded in the @xmath125-paths , to be small , roughly at most of order @xmath126 . by expanding the effective action @xmath127 $ ] up to second order in @xmath125 we arrive at a solvable gaussian path integral for the @xmath125-paths .",

    "one is left with the @xmath133-path integral which , written in form of a propagator , appears as @xmath134 where in @xmath135 the paths @xmath136 run from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , each one weighted with the exponential on the right hand side of ( [ dyn2 ] ) .",
    "one this way ends up with the path integral representation of the classical smoluchowski dynamics where @xmath139 obeys @xmath140 with the classical smoluchowski operator @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , from this derivation one finds @xmath142 to be at most of order @xmath143 .    to include quantum fluctuations to lowest order in @xmath92",
    ", we could proceed to directly calculate corrections to the propagator as in @xcite , which is rather involved , however . here , we follow a somewhat simpler route and first exploit that the flux vanishes in thermal equilibrium .",
    "accordingly , one writes @xmath144 with a dynamical correction @xmath145 , and an operator @xmath146 determined perturbatively up to order @xmath92 by @xmath147 with the equilibrium density specified in ( [ equiden ] ) .",
    "the latter one already contains the dominant part of the quantum fluctuations in the qse ( see below ) . to verify that @xmath148 can be disregarded",
    ", it suffices to study the path integral dynamics in the time range @xmath149 where it becomes effectively markovian .",
    "then , along the lines described above a semiclassical approximation applies and leads to a propagator including @xmath92 dependent corrections . from this , one finds @xmath150 and thus to be negligible . as the result , the equation for @xmath139 is of the form of the classical smoluchowski equation ( [ dyn5 ] ) but with @xmath151 replaced by @xmath146 , i.e. , @xmath152 where we introduced an effective force field and a diffusion coefficient , respectively , @xmath153 the expressions ( [ dyn6 ] ) and ( [ dyn7 ] ) determine the dynamics of overdamped quantum systems at lower temperatures .",
    "the corresponding quantum smoluchowski equation has still one deficiency though , which is directly related to the fact that it has been derived perturbatively .",
    "namely , it conserves thermodynamic symmetries , as e.g.  vanishing stationary currents in thermal equilibrium , only to order @xmath92 meaning that in a direct numerical integration higher order terms may give rise to unphysical results .",
    "the most obvious way to see this , is to consider the stationary current @xmath154 in a periodic , asymmetric potential @xmath155 with _ no _ external bias ( ratchet potential ) @xcite .",

    "apparently , the diffusion coefficient in ( [ dyn7 ] ) leads to @xmath160 and thus to @xmath161 .",
    "the strategy to cure this problem is to look for a `` uniformization '' of the operator @xmath146 by finding a proper diffusion coefficient @xmath162 which coincides with @xmath163 in order @xmath92 , leads to the equilibrium distribution ( [ equiden ] ) , and , of course , respects @xmath164 in thermal equilibrium .",

    "further , @xmath170/d(q)$ ] coincides with @xmath171 ( [ equiden ] ) up to corrections of order @xmath172 in the exponential which is consistent with our perturbation theory .    eventually , we arrive at the quantum generalization of the classical smoluchowski equation , the so - called quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse ) , @xmath173\\ , p(q , t)\\label{dyn10}\\ ] ] with @xmath174 specified in ( [ dyn7 ] ) and @xmath166 in ( [ dyn8 ] ) .",
    "the quantum analog to the classical langevin equation in the strong damping limit follows ( in the ito sense ) as @xmath175 with gaussian white noise @xmath176 .",
    "( [ dyn10 ] ) and ( [ dyn11 ] ) are the main results of this study .",
    "they describe the reduced dynamics of an overdamped quantum system from high down to very low temperatures and show that the corresponding quantum stochastic process is equivalent to a classical process in an effective potential and with multiplicative noise .",
    "the qse plays in the strong friction limit a similar role as the quantum master equations in the weak damping limit , since it allows for explicit results in strongly condensed phase systems .",
    "three examples from chemistry , mesoscopic physics , and soft matter will be presented in this second part .      the problem of escape from a metastable well can be found in a variety of realizations including chemical reactions , diffusion in solids , or nuclear fission processes , to name but a few ( see also the contribution by hnggi and ingold @xcite ) .",
    "its particular feature is a separation of time scales between local well motion and long time decay characterized by a decay rate .",
    "classically , a first thorough analysis has been performed in a seminal work by kramers @xcite with substantial extensions since then @xcite . for quantum mechanical systems",
    "a large amount of research has been done in the 1980s in the context of macroscopic quantum tunneling and the field has gained renewed interest recently due to its importance for solid - state based implementations of qubits . here , we look at the problem at strong friction and low temperatures .    the archetypical situation is the following : in a metastable potential @xmath67 a barrier with height @xmath177 separates a well region ( well frequency @xmath2 ) from a continuum .",
    "initially particles stay in local thermal equilibrium inside the well . as time elapses",
    ", particles surmount the barrier and for intermediate times ( plateau range ) their position distribution becomes quasi - stationary @xmath178 describing a constant flux across the barrier @xmath179 the decay rate follows from @xmath180 with the well population @xmath181 . for strong friction the changeover from quasi - equilibrium in the well around @xmath182 and nonequilibrium on the other side of the barrier",
    "is restricted to the vicinity of the barrier top located at @xmath183 .",
    "hence , the stationary distribution takes the form @xmath184 with a form factor obeying @xmath185 in a close range to the left of @xmath186 and @xmath187 in a close range to the right of @xmath186 .",
    "in fact , from ( [ exam1 ] ) a direct integration yields @xmath188 with @xmath189 specified in ( [ dyn9 ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that this distribution is identical to that obtained from real - time calculations @xcite .",
    "now , inserting @xmath190 into ( [ exam2 ] ) and by invoking a harmonic approximation around the well minimum and the barrier top according to the above discussion , we obtain the rate in the quantum smoluchowski range as @xmath191    .,width=302 ]    in this expression the second exponential accounts for quantum fluctuations , while the first factors coincide with the overdamped kramers rate .",
    "note that @xmath92 dependent terms enter exponentially and thus substantially enhance the quantum rate compared to the classical one ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . particularly in the high temperature domain the rate enhancement is damping independent and takes the form already derived by wigner @xcite .",
    "in the low temperature domain , however , a complicated dependence on damping appears associated with a strong increase of the rate compared to its classical value .",
    "a quantum rate expression that becomes exact in the semiclassical limit of a high barrier has been derived in @xcite . for strong friction this formula reduces to ( [ exam4 ] ) and already for moderate",
    "friction agrees well with the qse - result , fig .",
    "remarkably , the rate enhancement is observable already at relatively high temperatures @xmath192 provided damping is sufficiently strong to guarantee @xmath107 .      since the discovery of the josephson effect",
    ", devices based on josephson junctions ( jj ) have revealed an extraordinary wealth of phenomena studied theoretically and experimentally as well @xcite .",
    "recent realizations of the underlying system , two superconducting domains separated by a tunnel barrier , comprise superconducting atomic contacts @xcite and solid - state based quantum bits @xcite .",
    "in essence , two parameters determine the dynamics , namely , the coupling energy of the adjacent domains ( josephson energy ) @xmath193 and the charging energy of the contact @xmath194 of a junction with capacitance @xmath195 .",
    "it turns out that the competition between these two scales is crucially influenced by the electromagnetic environment surrounding the junction , i.e.  its impedance which in the simplest case is given by an ohmic resistor with resistance @xmath196 .    in the context considered here ,",
    "a particular feature of a jj is the fact that its dynamics can be visualized as a diffusive motion of a fictitious particle ( rsj model ) @xcite .",
    "this mapping is due to the famous josephson relations @xmath197 with @xmath198 , the difference between left and right superconducting phases @xmath199 , and where the phase velocity is related to the voltage drop @xmath200 across the junction .",
    "charge transfer captured by these relations corresponds to a phase coherent cooper - pair current . with the translation rules to the mechanical analog @xmath201",
    "the diffusive dynamics of the phase is determined by a generalized langevin equation .",
    "the case of very small capacitance corresponds to very strong friction so that for a current biased jj the classical time evolution reads @xmath202 with the josephson potential @xmath203 where the energy @xmath204 is related to the bias current @xmath205 , and current noise @xmath206 .",
    "this classical smoluchowski dynamics has been studied in detail already in the 60s @xcite .",
    "the qse developed above , provides a generalization of this description to lower temperatures where charging effects enter the game @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown in the context of single charge tunneling that for sufficiently low temperatures these lead to coulomb blockade associated with incoherent transfer of cooper pairs through the junction @xcite .",
    "we start by translating the constraints for the qse dynamics to the case of jjs . here",
    ", in addition to the relation ( [ sr2 ] ) we also have to take into account that typically the junction is subject to an external voltage ( or a corresponding current ) .",
    "accordingly , in order for the momentum @xmath207 to relax within the @xmath208time to a boltzmann - like distribution around @xmath209 , the external voltage @xmath210 is restricted by @xmath211 . by combining @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the plasma frequency of the unbiased jj , with this latter condition and expressing them in junction parameters we expect the qse to capture quantum phase diffusion in jj if @xmath214 in the above , @xmath215 with the resistance quantum @xmath216 . since typically @xmath217 the above condition allows for a broad range of values for @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and also large voltages @xmath220 .",
    "we note in passing that the above relation also ensures that the actual non - ohmic impedance seen by the junction can effectively be treated as ohmic .",

    "in particular , it turns out that barrier related quantum fluctuations incorporated in @xmath225 dominate in the limit of @xmath226 , while diffusion related ones , accounted for by the parameter @xmath227 , prevail in the opposite range @xmath228 .",

    "as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the result ( [ jj11 ] ) tends for @xmath253 to classical thermal activation over the barriers of the washboard potential @xmath254 , where quantum corrections are of the known damping independent form @xcite . at lower temperatures , i.e.  for finite @xmath227 , they show a complicated dependence on @xmath255 and capture the precursors of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) found at very low temperatures @xcite . thus , the central result ( [ jj8 ] ) fills the gap between established results in different transport domains : on the one hand , for fixed @xmath256 it leads with increasing @xmath257 from coulomb blockade to coherent cooper pair tunneling [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , arrow ( a ) ] . on the other hand , for fixed @xmath243 it connects with varying @xmath258 classical thermal activation with mqt [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , arrow ( b ) ] .",
    "apart from limiting cases , ( [ jj8 ] ) is easily evaluated numerically ; some results are shown in fig .",
    "hence , the qse approach allows to give , in a seemingly transparent manner , a complete description throughout a broad range in parameter space and must be supplemented only for very low temperatures ( @xmath259 ) by more sophisticated techniques @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example of molecular electron transfer ( et ) is the primary step of photosynthesis , but it is of fundamental relevance in a large variety of chemical and biological compounds @xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "two electronic sites denoted as donor and acceptor , respectively , interact with a bath of harmonic oscillators ( spin - boson model @xcite ) .",
    "completely equivalent is a formulation where the electronic system is coupled to a collective vibronic degree of freedom ( reaction coordinate , rc ) embedded in a thermal environment @xcite , see fig .",
    "the theoretical foundations to describe these systems have already been laid in the 1980s with the pioneering work by marcus et al .",
    "it turned out that qualitatively two dynamical domains must be distinguished : for vibronic dynamics fast compared to the bare et , characteristic for long - distance et , one speaks of nonadiabatic reactions ; in the opposite case of very slow vibronic motion , realized e.g.  in mixed - valence compounds , the reaction is said to be adiabatic . accordingly , for a donor - acceptor system transfer rates have been successfully calculated in the nonadiabatic regime by invoking golden rule techniques and for adiabatic reactions at sufficiently high temperatures by kramers flux over population method @xcite .",
    "these quite different approaches reflect the different physical processes that control the transfer , namely , in the former case the electronic coupling between diabatic donor / acceptor states , in the latter one the sluggish activated bath motion on the lower adiabatic surface . for",
    "sufficiently high temperatures and slow to moderately slow bath modes , first zusman @xcite and later garg @xcite derived equations of motion for the electronic dynamics interacting with a damped rc treated in the classical smoluchowski limit . since these zusman equations ( ze ) allow to derive a rate expression which to some extent comprises adiabatic as well as nonadiabatic effects , it is important to look for a low temperature extension @xcite .    ) .",
    "there it evolves on the coupled donor and acceptor ( thick line , minimum at @xmath260 ) surfaces where the et occurs in the landau - zener region near @xmath182.,width=283,height=226 ]    the corresponding hamiltonian is of the form ( [ sm1 ] ) with a system part @xmath261 where @xmath262 represents the bare electronic two - state system ( el ) as an artificial spin-@xmath263 system with donor @xmath264 and acceptor @xmath265 , a bias @xmath266 , and an electron transfer coupling @xmath267 ; the second part @xmath268 describes a harmonic collective vibronic degree of freedom linearly coupled to the electronic system and to a heat bath ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "what one is interested in is the dynamics of a state initially prepared on the donor surface .",
    "it is given by the exact path integral expression for the reduced density matrix of the el+rc system @xmath269 , @xmath270 @xcite .",
    "now , for strong damping ( slow rc ) a simplification according to the scenario discussed above is applicable .",
    "the difficulty then lies in the coupling between overdamped rc and electronic motion which basically makes a transition from one electronic state to the other only possible in the landau - zener ( lz ) region where the harmonic surfaces of the rc intersect ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "thus , three additional time scales enter the game : the typical time for thermal activation into the lz range , @xmath271 , the typical time the rc diffuses , after activation , in the lz range , @xmath272 , and the typical time the density matrix resides in a non - diagonal state , @xmath273 .",
    "it turns out that ( [ sr2 ] ) must be extended to @xmath274 in order to reduce the path integral expression .",

    "note that the effect of quantum fluctuations also shows up in the @xmath281 dependent coupling terms of the non - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "the coefficient @xmath282 contains the equilibrium variance of a damped harmonic oscillator @xmath283    by invoking again the time scale separation ( [ et3 ] ) the electron transfer rate can be derived from the gze @xcite . in case of a vanishing bias",
    "one finds for the total ( forward+backward ) rate @xmath284 with an adiabaticity parameter @xmath285 and with the reorganization energy @xmath286 . for @xmath287",
    "one recovers the adiabatic , for @xmath288 the nonadiabatic rate constant .",
    "the above rate expression looks like the classical marcus / zusman result with a renormalized reorganization energy @xmath289 .",
    "note that this simple renormalization only appears if quantum fluctuations in the @xmath290-coupling terms of the gze are properly taken into account . since @xmath291 quantum fluctuations always _ reduce _ the effective energy barrier which is to be surmounted .",
    "of course , in the high temperature limit ( @xmath292 ) we regain the known result , for lower temperature , however , significant deviations are observed .",
    "( i ) the ratio @xmath282 grows with decreasing temperature , at very low temperatures roughly linearly with @xmath293 . as a consequence , keeping all other parameters fixed , @xmath294 becomes larger with lower @xmath0 meaning that one approaches the range where the transfer is dominated by adiabatic processes at smaller values of @xmath295 compared to the classical range .",
    "( ii ) at lower @xmath0 , the exponent in the rate expression @xmath296 tends to become temperature independent in contrast to the classical result . since @xmath282 enters the exponent in ( [ et6 ] ) , even relatively small deviations from the classical behavior @xmath297 substantially influence the rate .",
    "in fact , if formally the limit of very low temperatures @xmath298 is taken [ which in a strict sense is out of the range of validity of ( [ et6 ] ) ] , @xmath299 saturates and one obtains @xmath300 which is identical to the overlap of two gaussian wave packets with overdamped harmonic variance localized around @xmath301 .",
    "hence , nuclear tunneling is included in the above rate formula , at least in a nondynamical way . in comparison with precise path integral monte carlo results ( from @xcite )",
    "a remarkable agreement is seen over a broad temperature range , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . at low @xmath0 ,",
    "the rate enhancement due to nuclear tunneling is substantial .    )",
    "according to the expression ( [ et6 ] ) ( solid line ) , the classical result ( @xmath302 , dashed line ) , and precise quantum monte carlo data ( diamonds , from @xcite ) . @xmath303 and @xmath304.,width=302 ]",
    "the description of quantum brownian motion is still a challenging problem . in general",
    "it does not allow for `` simple '' solutions in terms of tractable time evolution equations and even a direct numerical evaluation of the exact path integral expression for the reduced dynamics is not always feasible .",
    "while in the limit of weak friction various master equations have successfully been applied in the past , the opposite limit of strong friction has been left basically untouched .",
    "however , the naive expectation is that a strongly condensed phase environment quenches quantum fluctuations , thus forcing the system to behave more classically .",
    "in fact , this is only one facet of the problem since quantum mechanically small fluctuations in position are immediately accompanied by large fluctuations in the conjugate momentum .",
    "a systematic simplification within the path integral formulation leads indeed to an equation of motion which to leading order coincides with the classical smoluchowski equation , but contains substantial quantum corrections .",
    "applications for chemical , mesoscopic , and soft matter systems have shown the decisive impact of corresponding quantum mechanical fluctuations on transport properties even up to high temperatures where thermal energies exceed relevant time scales of the damped dynamics .",
    "so far , this analysis has focused on one - dimensional systems , but by exploiting the developed techniques extensions to two and three dimensions are certainly feasible .",
