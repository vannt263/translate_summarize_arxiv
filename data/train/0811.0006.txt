    "about 1/5 of the approximately 200 extrasolar planets discovered to date have masses comparable to jupiter s , but orbit their host stars at distances less than 0.1 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . since stellar heating inhibits the formation of gas giants around sun - like stars at such distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these `` hot jupiters '' likely migrated inward by disk torques from where they were born ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "once parked ( possibly because the disk was truncated by the stellar magnetosphere ; @xcite ) , hot jupiters are bathed in ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from their host stars .",
    "atmospheric gas is heated by photoionization of hydrogen , and escapes .",
    "several groups have argued that the outflows can evaporate gas giants nearly entirely , laying bare their rocky cores @xcite .",
    "in fact , hot jupiters are observed to have systematically lower masses than extrasolar planets at larger distances from their stars @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite are unable to reproduce the mass distribution of hot jupiters by experimentation with mass loss histories .",
    "observations of hd 209458b , the first hot jupiter observed to transit its host star @xcite , suggest that the planet may indeed be losing atomic hydrogen . @xcite",
    "used the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in a high spectral resolution mode to measure lyman-@xmath0 emission from hd 209458b s host star in and out of transit .",
    "they observed , with @xmath10 confidence , the ly@xmath0 flux  at wavelengths shifted from line center by doppler equivalent velocities of @xmath11to decrease during transit by @xmath115% (",
    "as integrated over doppler equivalent velocities extending approximately from -50 to -140 km / s and from + 30 to + 100 km / s ) .",
    "the authors attributed this decrease to absorption by intervening atomic hydrogen surrounding the planet : a halo of gas sufficiently distended and traveling at fast enough velocities to no longer be bound to the planet .",
    "the absorption signal was reported to be stronger at blueshifted wavelengths than at redshifted wavelengths ; blueshifted velocities ( towards the observer , away from the star ) were argued to arise from stellar radiation pressure acting on gas via the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the stis data and agreed that stellar ly@xmath0 photons were absorbed by planetary gas during transit , but found the signal to be weaker : the flux decreased by only @xmath12% , at similar doppler equivalent velocities of @xmath8100 km / s .",
    "moreover , no preference for blueshifted absorption was found .",
    "@xcite cautioned that intrinsic stellar variability could easily produce a spurious preference for either negative or positive velocities . despite this and other complications ,",
    "@xcite decided nonetheless that the absorption signal could be of planetary origin . from the effective occulting area corresponding to an 8.9% drop in flux",
    ", it was concluded that the obscuring hydrogen , while occupying a `` corona '' significantly more inflated than the visible photosphere , remained bound within the planet s roche lobe .",
    "this last argument , as pointed out by @xcite , is not secure .",
    "if the wavelength shifts associated with the putative absorption reflect doppler shifts from bulk flows , then the relevant velocities , regardless of whether they are positive or negative , are larger than the planet s escape velocity and can not arise from a bound hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "furthermore , as a point of principle , gas can flow past the roche lobe of the planet and elude detection if it is optically thin to ly@xmath0 photons ; therefore arguments based on effective occulting area are not conclusive .",
    "certainly we share the concern of @xcite that stellar variability can corrupt any interpretation of a planetary wind . while @xcite attempted to account for this statistically , the out - of - transit time baseline may be too short to characterize confidently the intrinsic variability of the stellar ly@xmath0 line ( j. winn , personal communication ) .",
    "there are further problems .",
    "lyman-@xmath0 absorption is measurable only in the line wings because of confusion near line center from the interstellar medium and from geocoronal ( terrestrial ) emission .",
    "even the line wings , however , can be contaminated by highly time - variable geocoronal emission .    @xcite",
    "further used stis in a lower spectral resolution mode to measure wavelength - integrated fluxes in various lines .",
    "these measurements enjoyed greater sensitivity to variations in a spectral line at the cost of not resolving the line profile .",
    "these authors observed , with 23@xmath13 confidence , the ly@xmath0 line flux to decrease by @xmath15% in transit .",
    "purely from an observational standpoint , this spectrally unresolved measurement is claimed to be consistent with the spectrally resolved measurement @xcite . despite the claimed consistency ,",
    "the two sets of measurements are made more than two years apart , which is perhaps worrisome given how stellar chromospheric emission is highly time variable .",
    "moreover , it is , of course , impossible to verify whether the spectrally unresolved observations pertain to the same strikingly large doppler equivalent velocities of + /-",
    "100 km / s that are so clearly implicated in the spectrally resolved observations . in any case , decrements in and line emission were also observed , with similarly marginal confidence .",
    "unfortunately , none of these tantalizing measurements could be reproduced after the stis instrument failed in 2004 .",
    "@xcite recently attempted similarly spectrally unresolved measurements with the hubble advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "their detection of absorption in transit is uncertain but consistent with previous claims .",
    "even if the stis observations do signify a planetary outflow , the mass loss rate implied is not necessarily large enough to seriously reduce the mass of the planet .",
    "@xcite claim a mass loss rate of @xmath14 based on a fit to the absorption depth at large dopper equivalent velocities vs.  time , and on considerations of how radiation pressure can shape the cloud of hydrogen as it expands away from the planet .",
    "note that radiation pressure is not necessarily claimed by these authors to drive the outflow ; they acknowledge the need for hydrogen to be heated by the star and to expand to distances approaching the roche lobe @xcite .",
    ", we show that radiation pressure acting on hydrogen through the ly@xmath0 transition adds at most 1% to the maximum mass loss rates achievable from a thermal wind heated by photoionization . ]",
    "theoretical models of thermal winds heated by photoionization generally produce mass loss rates that are several times @xmath15 @xcite . over the several gyr age of the system ,",
    "somewhat less than 1% of a hot jupiter s mass would be carried away by such thermal winds .",
    "@xcite presents particularly convincing hydrodynamic escape models .",
    "nevertheless , the question remains whether the various stis observations of hd 209458b are correctly explained as a planetary wind driven by photoionization .",
    "it is also unclear whether hot jupiters lose significant mass early in their evolution , when the uv luminosities of their host stars are enormously higher than their main - sequence values . in this paper , we demonstrate from a first - principles calculation that a hot jupiter can not lose a significant fraction of its mass via a planetary outflow driven by uv photoionization at any stage during its lifetime , including the pre - main - sequence phase .",
    "we further show that the spectrally resolved lyman-@xmath0 transit observations of hd 209458b @xcite probe velocities too large to reflect the bulk flow of a hot jupiter wind .",
    "observations of lyman-@xmath0 absorption at doppler - equivalent velocities of @xmath8100 km / s require either an additional source of high - velocity h atoms ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or an enhancement in the density of neutrals in or around the planetary wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss these possibilities in  [ sec - summary ] .",
    "our standard model is essentially that of a thermal or `` parker '' wind  a flow accelerated by gas pressure from subsonic to supersonic velocities through a critical sonic point @xcite  with the added complication that the heating is external , from stellar uv irradiation .",
    "our model includes realistic heating and cooling , ionization balance , and tidal gravity , but is simple enough that we can elucidate the basic physics and write down approximate analytic formulae for the mass loss rate .",
    "@xcite notes correctly that the planetary outflow need not take the form of a transonic wind .",
    "he points out that the host star wind can pressure - confine the planetary outflow down to a subsonic breeze .",
    "stellar wind interactions further complicate the planetary flow at large distances ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* who model stellar wind interactions with an entirely neutral wind escaping from hd 209458b at large velocities ) . by using our hydrodynamics code to compute breeze solutions ,",
    "we characterize qualitatively the extent to which outflows from hot jupiters are suppressed , both in the case of a wind emitted by a main - sequence sun - like star , and in the case of a pre - main - sequence t tauri wind .    in  [ sec - model ] , after reviewing some of the basic orders of magnitude characterizing hot jupiter atmospheres , we present our standard model of a steady transonic wind .",
    "we solve the equations of ionization balance and of mass , momentum , and energy conservation using a relaxation code , and we demonstrate the robustness of our solution by exploring a variety of input boundary conditions .",
    "the results of our model are presented for uv fluxes spanning four orders of magnitude , ranging from those expected for quiet main - sequence solar analogs to those emitted by active t tauri stars .",
    "section [ sec - discuss ] contains a wide - ranging discussion of various aspects of our wind solution . of especial interest",
    "are how the physics of mass loss changes as the uv flux increases from low main - sequence values to high pre - main - sequence values (  [ sec - twoexplain ] ) ; how host star winds can squash dayside planetary outflows , thereby perhaps energizing nightside outflows (  [ sec - breeze ] ) ; and how radiation pressure is ineffective compared to uv photoionization heating in driving an outflow (  [ sec - radpress ] ) .",
    "finally ,  [ sec - summary ] summarizes our findings , pinpoints why the estimate of @xcite and subsequent determinations by @xcite and @xcite of mass loss rates are erroneously high , and assesses the stis observations , both spectrally resolved and unresolved .",
    "we construct a simple 1d model for photoevaporative mass loss from a hot jupiter .",
    "we focus on the flow originating from the substellar point on the planet , and assume that mass loss occurs in the form of a steady , hydrodynamic , transonic wind .",
    "these restrictions imply that we will calculate a maximum flux of mass from the planet , insofar as ( a ) the substellar point receives the maximum uv flux from the star , ( b ) tidal gravity acts most strongly along the substellar ray to accelerate gas away from the planet , and ( c ) the transonic wind carries more mass than pressure - confined , subsonic breezes . applying our solution for the substellar , transonic streamline over all @xmath16 steradians yields a hard upper limit on the total rate of photoevaporative mass loss .",
    "how closely the actual rate of mass loss approaches this upper limit is discussed in ",
    "[ sec - discuss ] .",
    "we assume the base of the wind is composed of atomic hydrogen and calculate how the flow becomes increasingly ionized as it approaches the star .",
    "we neglect the molecular chemistry of hydrogen and do not capture the h@xmath17/h dissociation front .",
    "this simplification can be justified by showing that the temperature of the wind is higher than the @xmath12000 k required to thermally dissociate h@xmath17 , and by showing that above the @xmath18 surface to photoionization , our solution is insensitive to our chosen boundary conditions .",
    "this we do in appendix [ sec - bcsense ] ; a summary is given at the end of  [ sec - bcs ] .",
    "we further neglect helium and metals .",
    "we comment on the implications of this omission in  [ sec - summary ] .",
    "the rest of this section is organized as follows . in  [ sec - eqns ]",
    "we write down the basic steady - state equations of mass , momentum , energy , and ionization balance .",
    "the numerical methods used to solve these coupled ordinary differential equations are detailed in  [ sec - nummeth ] , which includes a listing of our boundary conditions . in  [ sec - modres ] we present the results of the model . for those wishing to skip to the punchline , a simple analytical description of our results may be found in  [ sec - twoexplain ] .    to help orient the reader",
    ", we now supply some of our standard model parameters , together with several order - of - magnitude estimates characterizing the wind . at lyman continuum wavelengths ,",
    "the solar uv luminosity is roughly @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the bolometric solar luminosity @xcite .",
    "to the extent that host stars of hot jupiters are like the sun , a hot jupiter with an orbital semi - major axis of @xmath21 au receives a uv flux of @xmath22 between photon energies of 13.6 ev and 40 ev ( this is nearly identical to the flux employed by @xcite but we derive ours independently of that study ) .",
    "this flux characterizes `` moderate to low solar activity '' @xcite , and is _ not _ averaged over the planetary surface ; for a discussion of the effects of surface averaging , see  [ sec - daynight ] .",
    "we take the planet to have mass @xmath23 and a fiducial 1-bar radius @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively , the mass and radius of jupiter . the planet s surface gravity",
    "@xmath27 cm / s@xmath28 is approximately the same as @xmath29 cm / s@xmath28 on earth .",
    "we take the effective radius of the planet s roche lobe , inside of which the planet s gravity dominates the host star s tidal gravity , to equal the approximate distance to the planet s l1 point : @xmath30^{1/3}a = 4.5 r_{\\rm p}$ ] , where @xmath31 is the mass of the star . in many astrophysical situations ",
    "including ours , as will be shown ",
    "photoionized gas cools by radiation from collisionally excited atomic hydrogen , which thermostats the gas temperature @xmath32 to @xmath1@xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding sound speed is @xmath110 km / s .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure scale height is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath36 is the mass of the hydrogen atom ( of course the wind is not strictly hydrostatic but it is nearly so near its base where speeds are still subsonic ) . to travel a distance @xmath37 at the sound speed takes a few hours .",
    "finally , we can estimate the gas density and pressure where the wind is launched , i.e. , where the bulk of the stellar uv radiation is absorbed . at a photon energy of @xmath38 ev , the cross section for photoionization of hydrogen is @xmath39 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; optical depth unity is achieved in a neutral column @xmath40 ; dividing this column by the scale height @xmath41 gives a neutral density @xmath42 ( equivalently , a neutral mass density @xmath43 ) ; and multiplying by @xmath44 gives a partial pressure @xmath45 nanobar at the base of the wind .",
    "by contrast , visible radiation from the star is absorbed at pressures closer to 1 bar , setting the temperature below the base of the wind to be @xmath46 k and the pressure scale height to be @xmath47 , where the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that the hydrogen at depth is molecular .",
    "the smallness of @xmath48 means that the wind is launched at a radius very nearly equal to @xmath37 : reducing the pressure from 1 bar to 1 nanobar takes about 20 scale heights or 0.1@xmath37 . in other words ,",
    "the radius at which uv photons are absorbed is approximately @xmath49 .",
    "this radius enters significantly into the magnitude of the mass loss rate , as we discuss in  [ sec - twoexplain ] ,  [ sec - summary ] , and appendix [ sec - bcsense ] .      as stated above ,",
    "we concentrate on the streamline originating from the substellar point on the planet . from mass continuity , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the distance from the center of the planet to the star , and the gas has density @xmath52 and velocity @xmath53 . in the frame rotating with the planet s orbital frequency ,",
    "momentum conservation implies @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we call the last term on the right - hand side of ( [ eqn - mom ] ) the `` tidal gravity '' term : it is the sum of the centrifugal force and differential stellar gravity , along the ray joining the planet to the star ( neglecting the small shift in the system barycenter away from the star ; cf",
    ".  @xcite ) . for simplicity",

    "we have three terms denoting , respectively , cooling due to @xmath59 work done by expanding gas , heating from photoionization , and cooling from radiation and conduction .",
    "we do not include a term proportional to the chemical potential because changes in energy due to changes in the number of particles are already accounted for in our photoionization term @xmath60 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn - energy ] ) follows in a straightforward way from the standard steady - state energy equation , @xmath61 , after using @xmath62 = constant and @xmath63 $ ] for the specific internal energy .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the uv flux is concentrated at one photon energy @xmath38 ev .",
    "then @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number density of neutral h atoms , @xmath66 is the fraction of photon energy deposited as heat , and @xmath67 is the optical depth to ionizing photons .    equation ( [ eqn - q0 ] ) assumes that photoelectrons share their kinetic energy with other gas species locally . we have verified _ a posteriori _ that this assumption is justified . for our standard model , at the wind base , a photoelectron travels @xmath68 before colliding with a neutral h atom , assuming a cross section of @xmath1@xmath69 .",
    "the number of collisions required for the electron to give up most of its energy to surrounding h atoms is @xmath1@xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the electron mass ; the corresponding distance random walked is @xmath72 .",

    "the problem of finding the structure of the wind is a two point boundary value problem ( for an introduction into the nature of such problems , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we have solved the problem by constructing a relaxation code . in our case relaxation methods",
    "are preferred over shooting methods because for every transonic wind solution there are an infinite number of breeze solutions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sonic point is a critical point where derivatives , if not carefully computed , can become singular . instead of searching exhaustively in a multidimensional space for the one solution that `` threads the needle '' of the critical sonic point , it is more efficient to start with an approximate solution that already satisfies the sonic point conditions , and refine that solution to higher accuracy .",
    "previous attempts that did not use relaxation algorithms to find transonic winds found , not surprisingly , breezes instead @xcite .",

    "the mass loss rates given in all our plots are upper limits because they take our 1d solution for the substellar streamline and apply it over @xmath16 steradians .",
    "the mass flux is maximized for the substellar streamline because the substellar point receives the maximal uv flux , and because the tidal gravity term weakens the planet s gravity most along the line joining the planet to the star .",
    "we now discuss the extent to which the actual mass loss rate is reduced because of day / night differences in the received uv flux , and because of the directional dependence of tidal gravity .",
    "for simplicity we discuss these effects separately , as if they could be isolated from one another .    ignoring for the moment differences between day / night external boundary conditions ",
    "these are actually significant and dealt with in  [ sec - breeze]day / night differences would be erased in the extreme case that horizontal winds redistribute photoionized plasma from the dayside of the planet to the nightside , on a timescale shorter than the wind s radial advection time of a few hours . in this case , the `` nightside wind '' would blow just as strongly as the `` dayside wind .

    "so if the dayside wind blows , the nightside wind is likely muted .",

    "the reduction factor equals 1/3.8 = 0.26 and 1/3.2 = 0.31 in the two respective cases .",

    "to first order , redistribution of plasma simply redistributes the wind over the planetary surface .",
    "changes in the total mass loss rate are expected to be of second order .",
    "for example , if the wind is strictly energy - limited (  [ sec - twoexplain ] ) , the mass loss rate depends only on the amount of uv radiation intercepted by the planet , and is independent of the degree of redistribution .    to get a sense of how much the mass loss rate is reduced because tidal gravity does not point parallel to all streamlines emanating from the planet",
    ", we eliminate the tidal term from the force equation ( [ eqn - mom ] ) and re - solve the fluid equations .",
    "we obtain a mass loss rate ( multiplying by @xmath16 steradians ) that is 0.79 @xmath153 our standard model result .",
    "this can be considered a maximum reduction factor for the directional dependence of tidal gravity insofar as its effect can be isolated .",
    "though tidal gravity does not change the calculated mass loss rate appreciably , it is nonetheless important for two reasons .",
    "first , tidal gravity alters the velocity structure of the wind , allowing it to accelerate to larger speeds ( figure [ fig-450v_tnt ] ) .",
    "second , tidal gravity moves the location of the sonic point to lower altitude , allowing it to remain within the roche lobe along the substellar ray and helping validate our 1d treatment .",
    "to summarize this subsection , if the dayside transonic wind blows freely , our crude accounting for the directional dependences of uv irradiance and of tidal gravity suggest that actual mass loss rates are lower than our plotted values by factors of @xmath14 .",
    "we now turn to the question of whether the dayside wind can actually blow , when faced with the considerable pressure of the host star wind .",
    "the planetary wind does not exist in vacuum .",
    "the dayside wind blows into the plasma streaming from the star : the stellar wind .",
    "stellar and planetary winds collide and mix in a standing bow shock surrounding the planet .",
    "the situation is analogous to the colliding winds of massive stellar binaries @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - cartoon ] supplies a cartoon illustration .",
    "however , as stressed in the figure caption and in the discussion below , numerous assumptions underlie this cartoon , and reality is likely to look substantially more complicated .    at the stand - off shock , the total pressures of the two flows balance .",
    "the total pressures include contributions from `` ram '' ( @xmath192 ) , thermal , and magnetic pressure , but should include only components that are normal to the shock front ( the shocks are oblique ) .",
    "the total pressure of the planetary wind decreases monotonically with distance from the planet .",
    "if the total stellar wind pressure @xmath193 near the planet is less than the total planetary wind pressure @xmath194 at the planetary wind s sonic point , then the stand - off shock will be located downstream of the planet s sonic point .",
    "there it can not influence the planetary flow upstream , for the same reason that one can not shout upstream in a supersonic flow and be heard .",
    "in this case the transonic wind solution that we have obtained for @xmath195and in particular our computed mass flux  would remain unchanged .",
    "what are @xmath193 and @xmath194 for a hot jupiter orbiting a main - sequence , solar type star ? for the former quantity we are guided by observations of the solar wind . at @xmath196 ,",
    "the solar wind has accelerated to nearly its maximum speed @xcite . approximating the stellar wind velocity as constant from 0.05 to 1 au",
    ", we scale characteristic spacecraft measurements ( soho ; ulysses ) of the solar wind density and velocity at 1 au to estimate the corresponding density @xmath197 and velocity @xmath198 at 0.05 au : @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "we take the local proton temperature to be @xmath201 ( the electron temperature is several times lower ; @xcite ) , and the magnetic field strength to be @xmath202 g at 10 stellar radii @xcite",
    ". then @xmath203 picobars , with the ram and magnetic pressures dominating .",
    "this is an overestimate insofar as we are not taking the components of the ram and magnetic pressures that are relevant perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "compare this to @xmath204 pbars , as calculated for our standard model of the substellar streamline ( see figure [ fig - breeze ] ) , neglecting the unknown magnetization of the planet .",
    "would be @xmath11 g. if the field falls as a dipole to @xmath205 , it would add of order 10 pbar to @xmath194 . ]",
    "given the uncertainties , the most we can say is that @xmath193 and @xmath194 are comparable . while a transonic wind solution along certain ( not necessarily substellar )",
    "streamlines may yet be possible , it is also possible  indeed even likely , given the fact that the solar wind can gust to values of @xmath197 and @xmath198 several times higher than the ones we have used  that the stellar wind squashes the planetary dayside outflow down to a subsonic breeze , or even stops dayside photoevaporative mass loss completely .",
    "a breeze would still blow a bubble in the stellar wind , like that drawn in figure [ fig - cartoon ] , only smaller .",
    "but because a breeze is subsonic , it would not traverse a shock at the bubble boundary . unlike the case for the supersonic wind , a breeze is in causal contact with the flow at the boundary ; i.e. , conditions at the boundary influence , via sound waves , conditions in the interior .",
    "the radial velocity would decrease smoothly to zero at the bubble boundary , giving rise to large pressure gradients that would drive flows parallel to the boundary ( by analogy to subsonic flow around a blunt obstacle such as a hard sphere ) .",
    "the flow inside the bubble would be nonradial and multidimensional .",
    "unfortunately , we can not easily capture such behavior with our 1d model ; if we tried to model a breeze by imposing a boundary condition of zero radial velocity at finite distance from the planet , while insisting simultaneously on a non - zero mass loss rate , our simple continuity relation ( [ eqn - con ] ) would yield infinite density .",
    "nevertheless , we can get a sense of how much the dayside mass loss rate might be reduced in the presence of external pressure , by re - running our relaxation code with boundary condition ( [ eqn - bc1 ] ) replaced by @xmath206_{r_{\\rm s}}$ ] , where @xmath207 is our breeze parameter . note that @xmath85 in this case is no longer the sonic point but is instead the location where the flow stops accelerating and starts decelerating .",
    "resulting breeze solutions are shown in figure [ fig - breeze ] , with the corresponding mass loss rates plotted in figure [ fig - breezemdot ] . while the total pressure @xmath208 for the @xmath209 wind solution decreases to zero at large distance , @xmath208 for a @xmath207 breeze asymptotes to a finite value . as @xmath210 decreases , the breezes blow more slowly , approaching the @xmath211 limiting solution for a hydrostatic atmosphere .",
    "once @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) , the @xmath208 profiles hardly change .",
    "we take as a reference pressure @xmath214 ; the location @xmath85 is a sensible one to examine since for the most part it decreases as @xmath210 decreases , mimicking the shrinking of the planetary bubble with stronger stellar winds . over the entire family of breezes ,",
    "the reference pressure @xmath194 achieves a maximum value of @xmath140 pbar for our standard parameters and boundary conditions .",
    "( recall that an isothermal hydrostatic atmosphere has a finite pressure at infinity . )    to the extent that our 1d solution lends insight into the 3d breeze problem , we conclude the following : if the stellar wind pressure @xmath215 pbars , the planet emits a full - fledged transonic wind ; if @xmath193 lies between @xmath13 and @xmath140 pbars , then the planet emits a dayside breeze with a finite mass loss rate ; but if @xmath216 pbars , then the planet s dayside atmosphere is forced to be radially hydrostatic , with the stellar wind penetrating to the depth where pressure balance is achieved .",
    "figure [ fig - breezemdot ] informs us that tiny increases in @xmath194 above 35 pbars correspond to enormous reductions in @xmath6 . at the same ,",
    "if @xmath194 is below 35 pbar , the mass loss rate is @xmath1@xmath14 , to within a factor of about 3 .",
    "thus , the stellar wind can act essentially as an on - off switch  at times permitting the planet to lose mass from its dayside at near maximum rates of order @xmath14 , and at others shutting down dayside mass loss completely . in the case of hot jupiters orbiting main - sequence stars , given how",
    "the stellar outflow pressure is of order 10 pbar and how it may increase dramatically during violent coronal mass ejections , we expect this switch to flip back and forth with stellar activity .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the dayside switch might even be off the majority of the time .    even when the dayside switch is off",
    ", however , we do not expect mass loss to shut down completely .",
    "as the dayside outflow weakens , the nightside wind should strengthen in proportion .",
    "that is because the uv energy that the planet absorbs must be spent one way or another ; if it is prevented from doing @xmath59 work against gravity on the dayside , it will instead power horizontal winds which carry heat to the nightside .",
    "dominates cooling , and the atmosphere remains in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "similar circulation models could be made for the thermospheres of atomic hydrogen of closer - in planets , in the case where the dayside atmosphere is forced to be hydrostatic by the stellar wind . ]",
    "shielded from the stellar wind , the nightside is free to emit its own wind .",
    "thus , the total mass loss rate might remain roughly constant at @xmath1@xmath15 , even when the stellar wind gusts ( assuming that no other energy sink becomes active ) .    in concluding that nightside winds will blow",
    "when dayside mass loss has been quenched , we have implicitly assumed that the planet resides outside of the region where the dipolar component of the star s magnetic field dominates . inside this region ",
    ", inside the star s alfvn radius  most magnetic field lines are not blown open by the stellar wind .",
    "closed , poloidal field lines can encage both dayside and nightside winds , confining atmospheric escape to magnetic flux tubes in the vicinity of the planet s poles .",

    "this conclusion is compatible with observations of mass loss rates from t tauri stars in the range @xmath219 to @xmath220yr @xcite and t tauri surface fields that are @xmath221 times stronger than their main - sequence counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore estimate that @xmath222 pbar @xmath223 @xmath57bar .",

    "it is not clear whether hot jupiters around t tauri stars reside inside or outside their host stars alfvn radii .",
    "if stellar rotation rates are locked to disk rotation rates at alfvn radii ( `` disk locking '' ; e.g. , @xcite ) , this question reduces to whether the planet orbits inside or outside the corotation circle . the current measured rotation period of hd 209458 of @xmath112.4 days ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) yields a corotation radius of @xmath10.1 au .",

    "notably , conductive transport of energy is not important , by contrast to the thermospheres of terrestrial planets .",
    "our assumption that mass loss from hot jupiters takes the form of hydrodynamic winds rather than local jeans escape is self - consistent : in our solution , escaping gas remains collisional at the sonic point .",
    "showing that this condition is satisfied at the sonic point is sufficient because the flow inside the sonic point is denser and hence still more collisional , while the flow outside the sonic point is supersonic and so can not influence the flow inside  in a supersonic flow , one can not shout upstream and be heard .",
    "we agree with @xcite and @xcite that the flow is never in a regime where jeans escape considerations are relevant ( see  [ sec - windvsjeans ] ) .",
    "we find that a planet similar to the transiting hot jupiter hd 209458b loses mass at a maximum rate of @xmath1@xmath14 for a uv flux characteristic of low to moderate solar activity .",
    "for a uv flux near the lyman edge that is @xmath123 times larger , as obtains during solar maximum ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the mass loss rate is @xmath1@xmath247 ( we have shown that at these fluxes , mass loss is energy - limited and scales nearly linearly with uv flux ) .",
    "this maximum mass loss rate is two orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath248 quoted by @xcite , and inconsistent with the claim by @xcite that planets lighter than 1.5 jupiter masses at 0.05 au from their stars evaporate entirely in @xmath249 gyr .",
    "we agree with @xcite ( who idealize the wind as neutral ) , @xcite , and @xcite that the current mass loss rate from hd 209458b causes the planet to lose at most 1% of its mass over its 5 gyr age .    what explains the factor of 100 discrepancy between our maximum mass loss rates and the mass loss rates given by @xcite and @xcite ?",
    "these authors , inspired by @xcite who model mass loss from the highly conductive atmospheres of terrestrial planets , posit that outflows from hot jupiters are energy - limited .",
    "energy - limited flows are those for which a fixed fraction of the stellar uv radiation incident upon a planet s surface goes towards driving gas out of the planet s gravitational well . as we have shown , conduction is not important in the winds emitted by hot jupiters , and therefore the details of the calculation by @xcite are not transferable .",
    "nonetheless , we find that for @xmath250 , as obtains for hot jupiters orbiting main - sequence solar analogs , hot jupiter winds are indeed nearly energy - limited .",
    "the energy - limited mass loss rate can be written as @xmath251 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also our equation [ eqn - energylimited ] ) , where gas is bound to the planet below radius @xmath252 and the bulk of incoming uv radiation is absorbed at @xmath253 .",
    "the difference between our calculated @xmath254 and that derived by @xcite arises from two factors .",
    "first , we include a heating efficiency @xmath255 , which must account at least for the energy lost to photoionizing atoms . in our simple model , @xmath256 ( recall equation [ eqn - q0 ] ) .",
    "second , and more significantly , our calculation places @xmath252 and @xmath253 closer to @xmath257 ( see beginning of  [ sec - model ] ) , the location of the @xmath144 surface to photoionization .",
    "@xcite take instead @xmath258 by applying detailed formulae derived by @xcite .",
    "these formulae are not appropriately applied to the photoionized upper atmospheres of hot jupiters , because in these environments conductive cooling is not significant .",
    "@xcite reaches essentially the same conclusion ; see his section 3.5 .    for high uv fluxes @xmath259 , like those incident upon hot jupiters orbiting active t tauri stars , mass loss ceases to be energy - limited .",
    "most of a fast photoelectron s energy is lost to collisionally excited ly@xmath0 radiation .",
    "by contrast to the case at low @xmath139 where photoionizations are balanced by gas advection and the neutral gas fraction remains of order unity at altitude , at high @xmath139 photoionizations are balanced by radiative recombinations .",
    "the transition to a nearly completely ionized flow is sharp , and the overall wind structure is reminiscent of a classic expanding region .",
    "whereas in the energy - limited regime @xmath6 is expected to scale as @xmath260 , in the radiation / recombination - limited regime @xmath6 is expected to scale as @xmath261 , essentially because that is how the number density of ionized atoms scales in a plane - parallel strmgren slab . our detailed numerical model yields power - law indices of 0.9 and 0.6 at low and high uv flux , respectively .",
    "we have demonstrated that above the @xmath18 surface to photoionization , our wind model is insensitive to our chosen boundary conditions .",
    "this helps to justify our neglect of hydrogen molecular chemistry .",
    "the uncertainty generated by this omission is embodied in our choice of the base radius @xmath101 , which by definition is that radius where hydrogen is predominantly atomic . without modelling the chemistry of h@xmath17 , we can not be sure where @xmath101 is located .",
    "but we have shown that we can estimate it to sufficient accuracy ( about 10% ; see the order - of - magnitude discussion at the beginning of  [ sec - model ] ) that our mass loss rates are uncertain by at most factors of a few ( see figure [ fig - bcrmin ] of appendix [ sec - bcsense ] ) .",
    "the bulk properties of our wind solutions are in good agreement with those of @xcite and our ionization profiles agree well with those of @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite model hydrogen and helium molecular chemistry in hot jupiter winds , and @xcite includes contributions from d , c , n , o , and ch .",
    "@xcite finds that if metals are present in the wind in solar abundances , they can increase the mass loss rate by factors of a few by reducing the effectiveness of h@xmath146 cooling at depth ( below the @xmath18 surface to photoionization ) .",
    "again , these details can be considered buried in our parameter @xmath101 .",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite considered the effects of lyman-@xmath0 line cooling  which we have demonstrated is important for large uv fluxes  or of line cooling from metals such as , , and .",
    "if classic regions are any guide , metal line cooling could exceed ly@xmath0 cooling , lowering hot jupiter wind temperatures by up to a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "metal abundances in the upper thermosphere are extremely uncertain , depending on unknown turbulent mixing coefficients ( `` eddy diffusivities '' ) . in any case",
    ", we do not expect metal line cooling to change our results qualitatively .",
    "it can only lower mass loss rates and wind velocities somewhat , strengthening our main conclusions .",
    "it is often said that transonic winds are characterized by zero pressure at infinite distance , while subsonic breezes have finite pressure at infinity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "but in practice , when considering how the outflow from the planet s dayside interacts with the outflow from its host star , whether the dayside emits a wind or a breeze does not require us to examine conditions at infinity .",
    "rather , we evaluate conditions at the sonic point . again , as with our criterion for hydrodynamic escape , the sonic point serves as discriminant because once the flow achieves supersonic velocities past the sonic point , it can not influence the flow inside the sonic point . if the total external pressure ( ram , thermal , and magnetic ) exerted by the host star s wind is less than the total pressure exerted by the transonic planetary wind at its sonic point , then the transonic wind solution obtains .",
    "otherwise , either the dayside emits a more gentle breeze or  if the external pressure exceeds some critical value ",
    "the dayside atmosphere does not escape at all but is forced to be in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . to the extent that the host star of hd 209458b emits a highly variable wind like that of the sun , we find that the stellar wind pressure is comparable to the planetary wind pressure at the sonic point ( both are measured in tens of picobars ) . during violent coronal mass ejections , the stellar wind pressure may overwhelm the planetary wind pressure .",
    "thus we expect that dayside winds from hot jupiters orbiting main - sequence solar type stars will alternately turn on and off ( with a duty cycle that might well favor the off state ) .",
    "when the dayside wind is off , we expect the nightside wind to turn on and pick up the slack ",
    "the absorbed uv energy now being used to power horizontal flows that carry photoionized plasma to the planet s nightside , which is shielded from the stellar wind and therefore immune to pressure confinement .",
    "winds from t tauri stars have magnetic and ram pressures that are some six orders of magnitude greater than their main - sequence counterparts . were a hot jupiter orbiting a t tauri star to also emit a wind , the pressure at its sonic point would be greater than under main - sequence conditions , but only by about three orders of magnitude according to our model .",
    "thus , a t tauri stellar wind will entirely quash dayside outflows from orbiting hot jupiters .",
    "outflows from the nightside ( if the planet is outside the stellar alfvn radius ) or along polar field lines ( if the planet is inside the alfvn radius ) would carry away at most @xmath1@xmath262 or @xmath1@xmath263 of the planetary mass .",
    "these quantitative considerations rule out speculations that mass loss is significant during the host star s youth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "returning to the main - sequence case , to what degree will a hot jupiter wind absorb stellar ly@xmath0 photons and produce an observable transit signature ?",
    "figure [ fig - obscure ] shows , for standard model parameters , how the extinction varies with wavelength in the ly@xmath0 line , assuming the planet is in mid - transit and that its orbit is viewed edge on .",
    "the extinction is integrated across the entire stellar disk ( to perform this integral , we extend our wind model out to @xmath264 ) .",
    "local line profile functions are voigt profiles , which include thermal and natural broadening . out to doppler shifts of @xmath265 , comparable to bulk wind velocities , the line is essentially black ( the ly@xmath0 emission produced by the wind itself is negligible since densities are low enough that the @xmath266 population of neutral hydrogen is well below the lte value ) . at doppler shifts of @xmath267 ,",
    "the extinction plummets to 23% .",
    "this result is at odds with the observational claim that hd 209458b reduces the stellar ly@xmath0 flux by some 915% at @xmath11 while in transit @xcite .    to drive this point home , we present in figure [ fig - vm2 ] the predictions of our model for the ly@xmath0 line during transit , computed by combining the out - of - transit line spectrum from ( * ? ?",
    "* taken from their figure 2 ) with our extinction curve ( figure [ fig - obscure ] ) . over the wavelength intervals used by @xcite , our model produces a flux decrement of 2.9% .",
    "shown for comparison is the observed in - transit line spectrum from @xcite .",
    "agreement between model and observation is poor : the model spectrum is hardly absorbed at large velocities , by contrast to the observed spectrum .",
    "what could explain this discrepancy between our model and the observations ?",
    "three possibilities present themselves : ( 1 ) our model underestimates the column of neutral hydrogen generated by the wind during transit by a factor of @xmath135 ; ( 2 ) physics that is missing from our model generates a population of neutral hydrogen moving at velocities larger than the bulk velocity of the wind ; or ( 3 ) the observed flux decrement at @xmath8100 km / s is due to some combination of geocoronal emission and intrinsic stellar variability ( see also ben - jaffel 2007 ) : processes that , if observed over long enough times , should not be correlated with the orbital phase of the planet .",
    "we now comment on possibilities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "our wind model generates a ly@xmath0 flux decrement of @xmath13% at doppler - equivalent velocities of @xmath268km / s due to naturally broadened , lorentzian line wings .",
    "if the column of neutral hydrogen traversed by stellar ly@xmath0 photons along lines of sight located 510@xmath37 from the planet were larger by a factor of 35 , then absorption generated by the line wings might generate the 915% absorption observed at @xmath268km / s .",
    "ben - jaffel ( 2008 ) argues that this is the case using the wind profiles of garcia - munoz ( 2007 ) , who calculates that the wind is @xmath130% neutral at @xmath15@xmath37 . at these distances",
    ", we find a neutral fraction of @xmath113% for our base case and @xmath16% for parameters matching those used in garcia - munoz ( 2007 ) , though in other respects our wind solutions largely agree .",
    "our ionization profiles are in better agreement with the solutions of yelle ( 2004 ) , which do not generate sufficient absorption in the lorentzian line wings to match observations ( ben - jaffel 2008 ) .",
    "the reason for these differences merits further attention .",
    "as previously noted , 1d wind solutions such as those in this paper , yelle ( 2004 ) , and garcia munoz ( 2007 ) break down at planetocentric distances greater than @xmath1510@xmath37 .",
    "multidimensional calculations could yield a larger neutral column ( j.  stone , personal communication ) .",
    "alternatively , is there some qualitative physics that our model is missing that could generate a population of neutral h atoms moving at velocities of @xmath1100 km / s ?",
    "an appeal might be made to interaction of the planetary wind with the stellar wind : in the bow shock , neutral hydrogen from the planet mixes with fast moving stellar plasma and might be accelerated to large blueshifted velocities ( see the simulations by @xcite of colliding stellar winds ) . but",
    "no similar argument can be made for the observed redshifted absorption  which , according to @xcite , sometimes appears stronger than the blueshifted absorption ( see transit b2 in his figure 3b ) .",
    "appeals to radiation pressure @xcite founder for the same reason .",
    "@xcite suggests turbulence in the planetary wind itself as a way to broaden the line . but to generate the large velocities observed , the energy in such turbulence would need to exceed the thermal and bulk kinetic energies in the mean flow by a factor of @xmath1100 .",
    "such energy requirements seem insurmountable .",
    "coriolis forces can turn streamlines that are initially in the plane of the sky into our line of sight , producing both redshifted and blueshifted gas . but the time required for gas to reach @xmath110@xmath37 , the size scale probed by the transit measurements , is too short to produce line - of - sight velocities of @xmath1100 km / s . in short , because the planetary wind stalls at the bow shock as it blows towards the star , stellar gravity can not accelerate the flow to large redshifted velocities .",
    "more promising is the possibility that charge - exchange between stellar wind protons and h atoms in the planetary wind could generate high velocity neutrals .",
    "holmstrom et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that h atoms will be accelerated by charge - exchange to velocities of @xmath1100 km / s on the assumption that the stellar wind interacts directly with the planetary magnetosphere at @xmath14@xmath37 and that neutrals from the planet have been lifted to that height . in neglecting the planetary magnetic field ,",
    "we have modeled planetary winds whose pressures exceed those of their magnetic fields . in this case ,",
    "charge - exchange in the shock between the stellar and planetary winds might likewise accelerate h atoms ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a discussion of charge - exchange in the bow shock of an infalling comet ) .",
    "hot jupiter magnetic field strengths are uncertain but magnetospheres may compete with planetary winds for the dominant source of pressure at high altitude (  [ sec - breeze ] ) . whether the stellar wind forms a shock with the planetary wind or with the planet s magnetosphere may vary from system to system .",
    "we conclude that although uv radiation from main - sequence stars can drive hot jupiter winds with mass loss rates of @xmath1@xmath269 g / s , the source of the observed absorption detected at doppler - equivalent velocities of @xmath8100 km / s in hd 209458b remains uncertain , with several possible candidates .",
    "what does our model predict for spectrally unresolved measurements ?",
    "@xcite collect light over all doppler equivalent velocities and indicate a wavelength - integrated flux decrement of @xmath270% .",
    "we take the out - of - transit line spectrum from figure 2 of @xcite and reduce it according to the obscured fraction computed in our figure [ fig - obscure ] . integrating over the range 1213.7@xmath271 , and excluding the line core between 1215.5 and @xmath272 ( velocities between -42 km / s and + 32 km / s ) inside of which",
    "interstellar absorption practically extinguishes the line ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we compute a wavelength - integrated ly@xmath0 flux decrement of 2.4% ( compare to the flux decrement in the visible continuum , 1.5% ) . as a check , we apply our procedure to the observed in - transit spectrum of @xcite , finding a flux decrement of 5.3% , in good agreement with the 5.7% quoted by @xcite . while our model flux decrement of 2.4% is sensitive to our assumed outer cut - off radius ( @xmath273 ) , and is uncertain because our model breaks down there ( we neglect the full stellar gravity field and coriolis forces ) , it is nevertheless close enough to the observed decrement of @xmath270% @xcite that the spectrally unresolved measurements may well be probing a planetary outflow .",
    "we look to the hubble space telescpe to reproduce this signature of a hot jupiter wind after stis is repaired or the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) is installed .",
    "this work was supported by a berkeley atmospheric sciences center fellowship and an american association of university women fellowship , both held by r.m .- c . , and by hubble space telescope theory grant hst - ar-11240.01-a .",
    "we thank jon arons for a careful reading of the manuscript and for helping us appreciate some aspects of magnetospheric physics .",
    "we also thank lofti ben - jaffel , steven cranmer , doug lin , geoff marcy , eliot quataert , john raymond , jim stone , and josh winn for helpful and encouraging conversations .",
    "finally we are grateful to the referee for an authoritative and thorough report that led to substantive improvements in our work , especially regarding the interpretation of the observations .",
    "we demonstrate that our solution is insensitive to our choices for bc3 through bc6 (  [ sec - bcs ] ) .",
    "that is , we show that our standard model represents a `` quasi - unique '' solution that hardly changes over large and physically realistic regions of input parameter space .",
    "we also show that while our solution does depend sensitively on @xmath101 ( which does not enter as a formal boundary condition but represents instead a global scale factor ) , that parameter is known sufficiently well that it introduces no more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in our determination of the mass loss rate .",
    "regarding bc3 , figures [ fig - bcrho ] and [ fig - bcrho2 ] show that as long as the base density @xmath119 is large enough that @xmath120 , the solution is insensitive to @xmath274 .",
    "our standard value @xmath275 gives @xmath276 and so satisfies this requirement .    for bc4 , we set @xmath277 to an arbitrary number @xmath278 . when @xmath120 , @xmath279 and our solution is not sensitive to its exact value ( figures [ fig - bcfp ] and [ fig - bcfp2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have verified that our solution does not change if we replace bc4 with the requirement that photoionizations balance radiative recombinations at @xmath101 .    for bc5",
    ", we have chosen @xmath280 k for our standard value . as demonstrated in figures [ fig - bct ] and [ fig - bct2 ] , our solution is insensitive to this choice as long as @xmath122 k ( the temperature such that thermal velocities are comparable to the local escape velocity ) .",
    "all models of hot jupiter atmospheres at depth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have this property .    regarding bc6 , figures [ fig - bctau ] and [ fig - bctau2 ]",
    "demonstrate that our solution is independent of our choice for @xmath117 as long as it is @xmath278 .",
    "this requirement is satisfied by the quasi - unique solution that appears when varying the other boundary conditions bc3bc5 .",
    "thus , we have shown that our quasi - unique solution self - consistently demands @xmath281 .",
    "the condition that @xmath123 is also reasonable because the optical depth of material outside the planet s roche lobe should be small .    finally , because we do not solve for the structure of the planet s atmosphere below @xmath101 , we are not sure whether our standard value for @xmath282 corresponds correctly to our adopted base conditions . in other words",
    ", we can not say with certainty whether our adopted base temperature of 1000 k and base density of @xmath283 are indeed reached at our assumed radius of @xmath284 .",
    "the value of the base radius is important since it helps determine the effective planetary cross section for absorption of stellar radiation and the local planetary gravity , both of which affect the mass loss rate ",
    "see equation ( [ eqn - energylimited ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig - bcrmin ] shows how our results depend on @xmath101 .",
    "the mass loss rate @xmath6 is indeed very sensitive to @xmath101 , changing by as much as a factor of 2 when @xmath101 changes by just 20% .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath285 scaling found in equation ( [ eqn - energylimited ] ) .",
    "however , our uncertainty in @xmath101 is only about 10% .",
    "we should choose a value for @xmath101 that lies between the 1-bar radius ( say ) and the radius where the bulk of the stellar uv photons are absorbed .",
    "from the estimates made at the beginning of  [ sec - model ] , @xmath286 . therefore in practice the uncertainty in @xmath6 due to our uncertainty in @xmath101 amounts to no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the extra cooling mechanisms we considered and found to be negligible include collisional ionization @xmath287 @xcite , recombination radiation ( appropriate for case a and thus an overestimate ) @xmath288 @xcite , free - free emission @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the gaunt factor @xcite , and conduction @xmath291 where the thermal conductivity @xmath292 erg @xmath293 k@xmath294 s@xmath294 @xcite . in equations ( [ eqn - lambdacol])([eqn - lambdafree ] ) ,",
    "densities are in @xmath295 and temperatures are in k. note that conduction can either cool or heat gas locally ( and indeed both signs are observed  see figures [ fig-450terms ] and [ fig-5e5terms ] ) .",
    "we also considered how collisional ionizations change the ionization balance .",
    "the collisional ionization rate is given by dividing ( [ eqn - lambdacol ] ) by 13.6 ev @xcite .",
    "we found this contribution to be negligible .",
    "to act as an effective coolant , ly@xmath0 photons must be able to escape the wind .",
    "but the wind is optically thick to ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "radiative cooling is thwarted if before the photons escape by resonant scattering , they excite h atoms that subsequently undergo collisional de - excitation , converting photon energy back into heat .",
    "we show here that this is not a significant effect .",
    "line photons escape by frequency redistribution : scattering into line wings where the ly@xmath0 optical depth @xmath296 is much reduced .",
    "the number of scatterings @xmath297 required for a photon to escape is given approximately by the inverse of the probability @xmath298 that an excited atom emits the photon at a frequency such that @xmath299 .",
    "we estimate this probability as @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the voigt line profile function , accounting for natural and thermal broadening at @xmath302 , and @xmath303 is the frequency for which @xmath304 , blueward of line center .",
    "the frequency @xmath303 is such that @xmath305 where @xmath306 and @xmath307 is the absorption cross section at line center . for a photoionization optical depth @xmath308 , we find that @xmath309 .",
    "this estimate neglects differential bulk velocities in the wind , which tend to decrease @xmath297 , and the random 3d directions with which photons are scattered , which tends to increase @xmath297 .",
    "both effects are expected to be of order unity .",
    "while the photon is being scattered , it spends a time @xmath310 `` locked '' inside an excited h atom ( in the form of electron excitation energy ) , where @xmath311 is the einstein a coefficient . by comparison ,",
    "if we assume that collisional de - excitations are dominated by fast thermal electrons , the time required for an excited h atom to experience a collisional de - excitation is @xmath312 , where @xmath313 is the electron - neutral de - excitation cross section and @xmath314 is the electron thermal velocity . in figure",
    "[ fig-450nfptau ] , we show that @xmath315 for @xmath316 for standard model parameters . putting it all together , we find that @xmath317 .",
    "thus the photon readily diffuses out of the wind before becoming thermalized .",
    "moreover , the photon spends such a small fraction of its time locked inside an excited h atom that outward advection of gas does not change this conclusion .                                                                                                                      , t.  n. , eparvier , f.  g. , bailey , s.  m. , chamberlin , p.  c. , lean , j. , rottman , g.  j. , solomon , s.  c. , tobiska , w.  k. , & woodraska , d.  l. 2005 , journal of geophysical research ( space physics ) , 110 , a01312"
