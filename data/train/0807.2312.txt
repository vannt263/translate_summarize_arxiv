    "<S> the substrate - induced strain is an important parameter influencing their electronic and magnetic properties , due to strong interplay of lattice , charge and spin degrees of freedom . in the ( pr , ca)mno@xmath2 system the strain influences not only the magnetic anisotropy@xcite , but more importantly the equilibrium between ferromagnetic metallic ( fm ) and insulating phases@xcite resulting in a spectacular decrease of the critical magnetic field required to destroy the insulating state in pr@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 thin films.@xcite    the ground state of bulk pr@xmath5ca@xmath6mno@xmath2 for @xmath7 is insulating@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> surprisingly , this trend is not observed when comparing @xmath10 and @xmath11 thin films @xcite . while for @xmath10 the critical field for the resistivity transition can be as low as @xmath12 t </S>",
    "<S> , no transition has been observed for @xmath11 in field up to 9 t which is larger than the bulk value@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since the resistivity transition is percolative , an absence of the transition does not necessarily indicate the absence of a partial destruction of the insulating state in a moderate magnetic field . here </S>",
    "<S> we report low temperature dc magnetization measurements in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin films to investigate the formation of the nonpercolating fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the dc magnetization to magnetooptical kerr effect ( moke ) measurements to investigate how surface effects and strain relaxation influence magnetic order and the formation of the fm phase .    </S>",

    "<S> contrary to bulk pcmo60,@xcite we find that the thin films are ferromagnetic and insulating below @xmath18k in the absence of an external magnetic field due to substrate - induced strain effects.@xcite the temperature dependence of the magnetization is shown in fig . 1 and is similar to previous results@xcite with the ferromagnetism appearing below @xmath3120k in both samples . </S>",
    "<S> above @xmath3120k the pcmo60/sto sample shows curie - weiss behaviour while the pcmo60/lao sample shows a small temperature independent ferromagnetic magnetization persisting up to temperatures higher than 270k . </S>",
    "<S> a similar ferromagnetic phase has been observed also in @xmath10 thin films on lao with a curie temperature of @xmath19k.@xcite    magnetic hysteresis loops in field up to 5 t at temperature 5k are shown in fig </S>",

    "<S> we observe an onset of formation of an additional ferromagnetic phase at @xmath20 t during the first sweep to 5 t . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this phase is the fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> the process is irreversible and magnetic hysteresis loops in a moderate field are permanently altered after first application of the highest field ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the change is most prominent in the pcmo60/sto sample in the field parallel to the film plane , and much smaller in the pcmo60/lao sample , where there is almost no difference for different magnetic - field directions .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show magnetization hysteresis loops in 1.1-t maximum field </S>",
    "<S> . loops in both samples reveal remanent magnetization for both orientations of the field . for the parallel field </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis curves taken after zero field cooling ( zfc ) are very similar in both samples . </S>",
    "<S> while there is almost no anisotropy with respect to the magnetic field direction in the pcmo60/lao sample , both the remanence and coercitivity are smaller in the pcmo60/sto sample in the perpendicular magnetic field indicating predominantly in - plane magnetization with a small out of plane component , assumed to be due to the bloch walls .    after the application of 5-t field the remanence increases in both samples for both field directions while the coercitivity significantly increases only in the pcmo60/sto sample for the perpendicular field direction . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy in the pcmo60/sto sample becomes even more pronounced while the response of the pcmo60/lao film remains almost isotropic .    </S>",

    "<S> , we conclude that the intrinsic @xmath21 contribution is below our sensitivity at this pe . on the contrary at 3.1-ev </S>",
    "<S> pe a nonlinearity of @xmath21 with respect to the magnetic field due to the intrinsic response is clearly observed in both samples .    in the pcmo60/sto sample </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21 loop is different from the zfc loop in the perpendicular field , but virtually the same as the magnetization loop after the application of a 5-t field . </S>",
    "<S> this is unexpected since the maximum field applied to the sample during moke measurements never exceeded 1.1 t. we can not completely exclude that the fm phase is photoinduced on the surface by the probing light during moke measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , since we do not observe anything similar in the pcmo60/lao sample , we believe that the behaviour is intrinsic and that the fm phase forms in the surface layer already at a magnetic field below 1.1 t . </S>",
    "<S> this surface layer contribution is not detected by squid due to its small volume fraction . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the kerr ellipticity , @xmath22 , shows no ( or a much narrower ) hysteresis despite the hysteresis in @xmath21 and squid magnetization loops . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates the presence of two different magnetic phases : one with a large and one without ( or very small ) hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that one of these phases corresponds to the fi phase and the other to the fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> both phases are observed also in the squid magnetization loop measured after exposure to a 5-t field ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 a ) ) indicating that both are present throughout the whole thickness of the film . similarly , </S>",
    "<S> remanence detected by both kerr rotation and squid magnetization loops indicates that the out - of - plane magnetization component exists not only in the bulk but also near the surface of the film .    in the pcmo60/lao sample a hysteresis similar to that in the squid magnetization loops </S>",
    "<S> is not observed in any moke loop while the field at which partial saturation occurs is similar in moke and squid magnetization loops . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that in contrast to the pcmo60/sto sample the magnetization of the top layer in the pcmo60/lao sample lies completely in the plane of the film . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the remanence of the bulk magnetization in the perpendicular field indicates that at least part of the magnetization away from surface is perpendicular to the film plane . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the out - of - plane easy axis observed in very thin pr@xmath23sr@xmath24mno@xmath2 films on the lao substrate@xcite and measurements in thicker la@xmath25ca@xmath26mno@xmath2 films@xcite where the magnetization is found to rotate along the film thickness from the out - of - plane direction near the lao substrate to the in - plane direction near the surface .    </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence from moke for the presence of the fm phase in the top layer of the pcmo60/lao film .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the difference magnetization ( @xmath27 ) obtained by subtracting squid magnetization loops measured after and before 5-t field exposure . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in the out - of - plane field the coercitivity and remanence of the loops are very similar in both samples , while there is a large difference when the field is applied in the plane .    in the pcmo60/lao sample </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath27 could be interpreted as the magnetization of the induced fm phase . a narrower more rectangular hysteresis observed in the in - plane field </S>",
    "<S> is compatible with an in - plane magnetization direction of the induced - fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the fm phase is induced mostly in the top layer of the film .    </S>",
    "<S> the same interpretation of @xmath27 is not possible in the pcmo60/sto sample . here </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis loop in the parallel field displays regions with the clockwise sense of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is possible only if the amount of both fi and fm phases is modified by exposure to the 5-t magnetic field . despite two contributions to @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the absence of the saturation of @xmath27 in the out - of - plane field as an evidence for predominantly in plane magnetization of the induced fm phase corresponding to the hard - axis magnetic anisotropy which is much larger than in the pcmo60/lao sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the remanence in the response of the induced fm phase for the out - of - plane field in both samples can be attributed to the bloch walls between magnetic domains , which have magnetization perpendicular to the film plane , as in the case of the fi phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in contrast to bulk pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , a large amount of fi phase exists in substrate - strained pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin films at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this phase shows a change of the magnetic anisotropy from an out - of - plane easy - axis near the substrate to an out - of - plane hard - axis near the surface in the pcmo60/lao film with the compressive substrate - induced strain . in the pcmo60/sto film , with the tensile substrate - induced strain , </S>",
    "<S> the fi phase shows an out - of - plane hard - axis - type anisotropy across the whole thickness of the film . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> a metastable nonpercolating fm phase is induced during the application of an external magnetic field with a bulk threshold field about 4 t at 5k . at the surface of the film on the sto substrate moke indicates the presence of the fm phase already in a magnetic field below 1.1 t at 5k .    </S>",
