    "entanglement is the most intriguing feature of quantum mechanics and a key resource in quantum information science .",
    "one of the main goals in these theories is to develop a comprehensive theory of multipartite entanglement .",
    "various entanglement measures have been invented to quantify the multi - particle entanglement @xcite but none of them were able to suggest a method for calculating a measure of multipartite systems .",
    "this mathematical difficulty is the main obstacle to elaborate a theory of multi - particle entanglement .    in this paper , we present the first calculation of the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite for three qubit states which are expressed as linear combinations of four given orthogonal product states .",
    "any pure three qubit state can be written in terms of five preassigned orthogonal product states @xcite via schmidt decomposition .",
    "thus the states discussed here are more general states compared to the well - known ghz @xcite and w @xcite states .",
    "the reason for using the geometric measure of entanglement is that it is suitable for any partite system regardless of its dimensions .",
    "however , analytical computation for generic states still remains as a great challenge .",
    "the measure depends on entanglement eigenvalue @xmath0 and can be derived from the formula @xmath1 . for pure states ,",
    "the entanglement eigenvalue is equal to the maximal overlap of a given state with any complete product state .",
    "this measure has the following remarkable properties :    \\i ) it has an operational treatment .",
    "the same overlap @xmath0 defines groverian measure of entanglement @xcite which has been introduced later in operational terms . in other words , it quantifies how well a given state serves as an input state to grover s search algorithm @xcite . from this view",
    ", groverian measure can be regarded as an operational treatment of the geometric measure .",
    "\\ii ) it has identified irregularity in channel capacity additivity @xcite . using this measure , one can show that a family of quantities , which were thought to be additive in an earlier papers , actually are not .",
    "for example , it is natural to conjecture that preparing two pairs of entangled particles should give us twice the entanglement of one pair and , similarly , using a channel twice doubles its capacity .",
    "however , this conjecture claiming additivity has proved to be wrong in some cases .",
    "\\iii ) it has useful connections to other entanglement measures and gives rise to a lower bound on the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite and generalized robustness @xcite . for certain pure states the first lower bound",
    "is saturated and thus their relative entropy of entanglement can be deduced from their geometric measure of entanglement . the second lower bound to generalized robustness can be express in terms of @xmath0 directly .",
    "owing to these features , the geometric measure can play an important role in the investigation of different problems related to entanglement .",
    "for example , the entanglement of two distinct multipartite bound entangled states can be determined analytically in terms of a geometric measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "recently , the same measure has been used to understand the physical implication of zamolodchikov s c - theorem @xcite more deeply .",
    "it is an important application regarding the quantum information techniques in the effect of renormalization group in field theories @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural that geometric measure of entanglement is an object of intense interest and in some recent works revised @xcite and generalized @xcite versions of the geometric measure were presented .",
    "the progress made to date allows oneself to calculate the geometric measure of entanglement for pure three qubit systems @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to use @xmath2-qubit mixed states to calculate the geometric measure of @xmath3-qubit pure states . in the case of three qubits",
    "this idea converts the task effectively into the maximization of the two - qubit mixed state over product states and yields linear eigenvalue equations @xcite .",
    "the solution of these linear eigenvalue equations reduces to the root finding for algebraic equations of degree six . however , three - qubit states containing symmetries allow complete analytical solutions and explicit expressions as the symmetry reduces the equations of degree six to the quadratic equations .",
    "analytic expressions derived in this way are unique and the presented effective method can be applied for extended quantum systems .",
    "our aim is to derive analytic expressions for a wider class of three qubit systems and in this sense this work is the continuation of ref.@xcite .",
    "we consider most general w - type three qubit states that allow to derive analytic expressions for entanglement eigenvalue .",
    "these states can be expressed as linear combinations of four given orthogonal product states .",
    "if any of coefficients in this expansion vanishes , then one obtains the states analyzed in @xcite .",
    "notice that arbitrary linear combinations of five product states @xcite give a couple of algebraic equations of degree six .",
    "hence variste galois s theorem does not allow to get analytic expressions for these states except some particular cases .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for an entanglement eigenvalue .",
    "each expression has its own applicable domain depending on state parameters and these applicable domains are split up by separating surfaces .",
    "thus the geometric measure distinguishes different types of states depending on the corresponding applicable domain .",
    "states that lie on separating surfaces are shared by two types of states and acquire new features .    in section",
    "ii we derive stationarity equations and their solutions . in section iii",
    "we specify three qubit states under consideration and find relevant quantities . in section iv we calculate entanglement eigenvalues and present explicit expressions . in section",
    "v we separate the validity domains of the derived expressions . in section",
    "vi we discuss shared states . in section vii",
    "we make concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly review the derivation of the stationarity equations and their general solutions @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath4 the density matrix of the three - qubit pure state and define the entanglement eigenvalue @xmath0 @xcite    @xmath5    where the maximization runs over all normalized complete product states .",
    "theorem 1 of ref.@xcite states that the maximization of a pure state over a single qubit state can be completely derived by using a particle traced over density matrix . hence the theorem allows us to re - express the entanglement eigenvalue by reduced density matrix @xmath6 of qubits a and b    @xmath7    now we introduce four bloch vectors :    1)@xmath8 for the reduced density matrix @xmath9 of the qubit a ,    2)@xmath10 for the reduced density matrix @xmath11 of the qubit b ,    3)@xmath12 for the single qubit state @xmath13 ,    4)@xmath14 for the single qubit state @xmath15 .",
    "then the expression for entanglement eigenvalue ( [ gen.pred ] ) takes the form    @xmath16    where(summation on repeated indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 is understood )    @xmath19    and @xmath20 s are pauli matrices .",
    "the closest product state satisfies the stationarity conditions    @xmath21    where lagrange multipliers @xmath22 and @xmath23 enforce the unit bloch vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "the solutions of eq.([gen.eq ] ) are    @xmath24    unknown lagrange multipliers are defined by equations    @xmath25    in general , eq.([gen.alg ] ) gives algebraic equations of degree six .",
    "the reason for this is that stationarity equations define all extremes of the reduced density matrix @xmath6 over product states , regardless of them being global or local . and",
    "the degree of the algebraic equations is the number of possible extremes .",
    "eq.([gen.sol ] ) contains valuable information .",
    "it provides solid bases for a new numerical approach .",
    "this can be compared with the numerical calculations based on other technique @xcite .",
    "we consider w - type state    @xmath26 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath27 . without loss of generality",
    "we consider only the case of positive parameters @xmath28 . at first sight , it is not obvious whether the state allows analytic solutions or not .",
    "however , it does and our first task is to confirm the existence of the analytic solutions .",
    "in fact , entanglement of the state eq.([w.psi ] ) is invariant under the permutations of four parameters @xmath28 .",
    "the invariance under the permutations of three parameters @xmath29 is the consequence of the invariance under the permutations of qubits a , b , c .",
    "now we make a local unitary(lu ) transformation that relabels the bases of qubits b and c , i.e. @xmath30 , and does not change the basis of qubit a. this lu - transformation interchanges the coefficients as follows : @xmath31 . since any entanglement measure must be invariant under lu - transformations and the permutation @xmath32 , it must be also invariant under the permutation @xmath33 . in view of this symmetry",
    ", any entanglement measure must be invariant under the permutations of all the state parameters @xmath28 .",
    "owing to this symmetry , the state allows to derive analytic expressions for the entanglement eigenvalues .",
    "the necessary condition is @xcite    @xmath34    indeed , if the condition ( [ w.det ] ) is fulfilled , then the expressions ( [ gen.sol ] ) for the general solutions are not applicable and eq.([gen.eq ] ) admits further simplification .",
    "denote by @xmath35 unit vectors along axes @xmath36 respectively .",
    "straightforward calculation yields    @xmath37    where @xmath38    vectors",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath14 can be written as linear combinations    @xmath39    of vectors @xmath35 .",
    "the substitution of the eq.([w.ijk ] ) into eq.([gen.eq ] ) gives a couple of equations in each direction .",
    "the result is a system of six linear equations    [ w.sub ] @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42    above equations impose two conditions    [ w.imp ] @xmath43 @xmath44    from these equations it can be deduced that the condition ( [ w.det ] ) is valid and the system of equations ( [ gen.eq ] ) and ( [ gen.alg ] ) is solvable .",
    "note that as a consequences of eq.([w.sub ] ) @xmath45 and/or @xmath46 components of vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 vanish simultaneously .",
    "hence , conditions ( [ w.imp ] ) are satisfied in following three cases :    * vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 lie in @xmath47 plane @xmath48 * vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 lie in @xmath49 plane @xmath50 * vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 are aligned with axis @xmath51 @xmath52    these cases are examined individually in next section .",
    "in this section we analyze all three cases and derive explicit expressions for entanglement eigenvalue .",
    "each expression has its own range of definition in which they are deemed applicable .",
    "three ranges of definition cover the four dimensional sphere given by normalization condition .",
    "it is necessary to separate the validity domains and to make clear which of expressions should be applied for a given state .",
    "it turns out that the separation of domains requires solving inequalities that contain polynomials of degree six .",
    "this is a nontrivial task and we investigate it in the next section .",
    "let us consider the first case .",
    "our main task is to find lagrange multipliers @xmath22 and @xmath23 . from equations ( [ w.sub3 ] ) and ( [ w.vers1 ] ) we have",
    "@xmath53    in its turn eq.([w.sub1 ] ) gives    @xmath54    eq.([gen.alg ] ) allows the substitution of expressions ( [ cq.sz ] ) into eq.([cq.sx ] ) .",
    "then we can obtain the second equation for lagrange multipliers    @xmath55    this equation has a simple form owing to condition ( [ w.det ] ) .",
    "thus we can factorize the equation of degree six into the quadratic equations .",
    "equations ( [ cq.con ] ) and ( [ w.vers1 ] ) together yield    @xmath56    note that we kept only positive values of lagrange multipliers and omitted negative values to get the maximal value of @xmath0 . now eq.([gen.s1s2 ] ) takes the form    @xmath57    in fact , entanglement eigenvalue is the sum of two equal terms and this statement follows from the identity    @xmath58    to derive this identity one has to use the normalization condition @xmath59 .",
    "the identity allows to rewrite eq.([cq.eigprim1 ] ) as follows    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    above formula has a geometric interpretation and now we demonstrate it .",
    "let us define a quantity @xmath62 .",
    "then the denominator can be rewritten as    @xmath63    five independent parameters are necessary to construct a convex quadrangle . however , four independent parameters are necessary to construct a convex quadrangle that has circumradius . for such quadrangles",
    "the area @xmath64 is given exactly by eq.([cq.her ] ) up to numerical factor , that is @xmath65 . hence eq.([cq.circ ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath66    thus @xmath67 can be interpreted as a circumradius of the convex quadrangle .",
    "eq.([cq.radius ] ) is the generalization of the corresponding formula of ref.@xcite and reduces to the circumradius of the triangle if one of parameters is zero .",
    "eq.([cq.eigfin ] ) is valid if vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 are unit and have non - vanishing @xmath45 components .",
    "these conditions have short formulations    @xmath68 ) .      here ,",
    "we consider the second case given by eq.([w.vers2 ] ) .",
    "derivations repeat steps of the previous subsection and the only difference is the interchange @xmath69 .",
    "therefore we skip some obvious steps and present only main results .",
    "components of vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 along axis @xmath51 are    @xmath70    the second equation for lagrange multipliers    @xmath71    together with eq.([w.vers2 ] ) yields    @xmath72    using these expressions , one can derive the following expression for entanglement eigenvalue    @xmath73    now the restrictions @xmath74 derived in ref.@xcite uniquely define the signs in eq.([cr.lam - mu ] ) .",
    "right signs enforce strictly positive fraction in right hand side of eq.([cr.eigprim2 ] ) .",
    "to make a right choice , we replace @xmath75 by @xmath76 in the identity ( [ cq.iden ] ) and rewrite eq.([cr.eigprim2 ] ) as follows    @xmath77    lower sign yields zero and is wrong .",
    "it shows that reduced density matrix @xmath6 still has zero eigenvalue .",
    "upper sign may yield a true answer .",
    "entanglement eigenvalue is    @xmath78    where    @xmath79    and @xmath80 .",
    "the formula ( [ cr.radius ] ) may seem suspicious because it is not clear whether right hand side is positive and lies in required region .",
    "to clarify the situation we present a geometrical treatment of eq.([cr.radius ] ) .",
    "the geometrical figure @xmath81 in fig.1a is not a quadrangle and is not a polygon at all .",
    "the reason is that it has crossed sides @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we call figure @xmath81 crossed - quadrangle in a figurative sense as it has four sides and a cross point",
    ". another justification of this term is that we will compare figure @xmath81 in fig.1a with a convex quadrangle @xmath81 containing the same sides .",
    "this figure shows the example for the case when crossed quadrangle(fig.1a ) has larger circumradius than that of convex quadrangle(fig.1b ) with same sides.,width=377 ]    consider a crossed - quadrangle @xmath81 with sides @xmath84 that has circumcircle .",
    "it is easy to find the length of the interval @xmath85",
    "@xmath86    this relation is true unless triangles @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the same height and as a consequence equal areas . note that @xmath89 is not an area of the crossed - quadrangle .",
    "it is the difference between the areas of the noted triangles .    using eq.([cr.ab ] )",
    ", one can derive exactly eq.([cr.radius ] ) for the circumradius of the crossed - quadrangle .",
    "eq.([cr.eigfin ] ) is meaningful if vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 are unit and have nonzero components along the axis @xmath46 .",
    "in this subsection we consider the last case described by eq.([w.vers3 ] ) .",
    "entanglement eigenvalue takes maximal value if all terms in r.h.s . of eq.([gen.s1s2",
    "] ) are positive",
    ". then equations ( [ w.vers3 ] ) and ( [ w.matr ] ) together impose    @xmath90    where sign(x ) gives -1 , 0 or 1 depending on whether x is negative , zero , or positive .",
    "substituting these values into eq.([gen.s1s2 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath91    owing to inequality , @xmath92 , above expression always gives a square of the largest coefficient @xmath93    @xmath94    in eq.([w.psi ] ) . indeed , let us consider the case @xmath95 .",
    "from inequalities @xmath96 it follows that @xmath97 and therefore @xmath98 .",
    "note , @xmath98 is necessary but not sufficient condition . now",
    "if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 yields @xmath101 and if @xmath102 , then @xmath103 yields @xmath101 .",
    "thus inequality @xmath101 is true in all cases .",
    "similarly @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the largest coefficient . on the other hand @xmath106 and eq.([lc.3 ] ) really gives the largest coefficient in this case .",
    "similarly , cases @xmath107 and @xmath108 yield @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "and again entanglement eigenvalue takes the value of the largest coefficient .",
    "the last possibility @xmath111 can be analyzed using analogous speculations .",
    "one obtains @xmath112 and @xmath75 is the largest coefficient .    combining all cases mentioned earlier , we rewrite eq.([lc.3 ] )",
    "as follows    @xmath113    this expression is valid if both vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 are collinear with the axes @xmath51 .",
    "we have derived three expressions for ( [ cq.eigfin]),([cr.eigfin ] ) and ( [ lc.larg ] ) for entanglement eigenvalue .",
    "they are valid when vectors @xmath12 and @xmath14 lie in @xmath47 plane , lie in @xmath49 plane and are collinear with axis @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the following section goes on to specify these domains by parameters @xmath28 .",
    "mainly , two points are being analyzed .",
    "first , we probe into the meaningful geometrical interpretations of quantities @xmath67 and @xmath114 .",
    "second , we separate validity domains of equations ( [ cq.eigfin]),([cr.eigfin ] ) and ( [ lc.larg ] ) .",
    "it is mentioned earlier that algebraic methods for solving the inequalities of degree six are ineffective .",
    "hence , we use geometric tools that are elegant and concise in this case .    we consider four parameters @xmath28 as free parameters as the normalization condition is irrelevant here . indeed , one can use the state @xmath115 where all parameters are free .",
    "if one repeats the same steps , the only difference is that the entanglement eigenvalue @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath116 . in other words ,",
    "normalization condition re - scales the quadrangle , convex or crossed , so that the circumradius always lies in the required region .",
    "consequently , in constructing quadrangles we can neglect the normalization condition and consider four free parameters @xmath28 .",
    "it is known that four sides @xmath28 of the convex quadrangle must obey the inequality @xmath117 .",
    "any set of such parameters forms a cyclic quadrilateral .",
    "note that the quadrangle is not unique as the sides can be arranged in different orders .",
    "but all these quadrangles have the same circumcircle and the circumradius is unique",
    ".    the sides of a crossed - quadrangle must obey the same condition .",
    "indeed , from fig.1a it follows that @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    ". therefore @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the sides @xmath83 and @xmath122 are two largest sides and consequently @xmath117 .",
    "however , the existence of the circumcircle requires an additional condition and it is explained here . the relation @xmath123 forces @xmath124 and , therefore    @xmath125    thus the denominator in eq.([cr.radius ] ) must be positive . on the other hand the inequality @xmath126 forces a positive numerator of the same fraction    @xmath127    these two inequalities impose conditions on parameters @xmath28 . for the future considerations , we need to write explicitly the condition imposed by inequality ( [ ad.posnum ] ) . the numerator is a symmetric function on parameters @xmath28 and it suffices to analyze only the case @xmath128 .",
    "obviously @xmath129 and it remains the constraint @xmath130 .",
    "the last inequality states that the product of the largest and smallest coefficients must not exceed the product of remaining coefficients .",
    "denote by @xmath131 the smallest coefficient    @xmath132    we can summarize all cases as follows    @xmath133    this is necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of @xmath114 . the next condition @xmath134 we do not analyze because the first condition ( [ ad.largesmal ] ) suffices to separate the validity domains .      in this section",
    "we define applicable domains of expressions ( [ cq.eigfin]),([cr.eigfin ] ) and ( [ lc.larg ] ) step by step .",

    "thus the perimeter and diagonals of the quadrangle divide ranges of definition of the convex quadrangle .",
    "when the center of circumcircle passes the perimeter , entanglement eigenvalue changes - over from convex circumradius to the largest coefficient .",
    "and if the center lies on the diagonal , convex and crossed circumradiuses become equal .",
    "we would like to bring plausible arguments that this picture is incomplete and there is a region that has been shrunk to the point .",
    "consider three - qubit state given by gsd    latexmath:[\\[\\label{ss.gsd }     one of parameters must have non - vanishing phase@xcite and we can treat this phase as an angle .",
    "then , we have five sides and an angle .",
    "this set defines a sexangle that has circumcircle .",
    "one can guess that in a highly entangled region entanglement eigenvalue is the circumradius of the sexangle .",
    "however , there is a crucial difference .",
    "any convex sexangle contains a star type area and the sides of this area are the diagonals of the sexangle .",
    "the perimeter of the star separates the convex and the crossed cases .",
    "unfortunately , we can not see this picture in our case because the diagonals of a quadrangle confine a single point .",
    "it is left for future to calculate the entanglement eigenvalues for arbitrary three qubit states and justify this general picture .",
    "shared states given by @xmath156 acquire new properties .",
    "they can be used for perfect teleportation and superdense coding @xcite .",
    "this statement is not proven clearly , but also no exceptions are known .    now consider a case where the largest coefficient and circumradius of the convex quadrangle coincide with each other .",
    "the separating surface is given by    @xmath192    entanglement eigenvalue ranges within the narrow interval    @xmath193    it separates slightly and highly entangled states . when one of coefficients is large enough and satisfies the relation @xmath194 , entanglement eigenvalue takes a larger coefficient .",
    "and the expression ( [ w.psi ] ) for the state function effectively takes the place of schmidt decomposition . in highly entangled region",
    "no similar picture exists and all coefficients participate in equal parts and yield the circumradius .",
    "thus , shared states given by eq.([ss.con - lar ] ) separate slightly entangled states from highly entangled ones , and can be ascribed to both types .    what is the meaning of these states ?",
    "shared states given by @xmath156 acquire new and important features .",
    "one can expect that shared states dividing highly and slightly entangled states also must acquire some new features",
    ". however , these features are yet to be discovered .",
    "we have considered three - parametric families of three qubit states and derived explicit expressions for entanglement eigenvalue .",
    "the final expressions have their own geometrical interpretation . the result in this paper with the results of ref.@xcite",
    "show that the geometric measure has two visiting cards : the circumradius and the largest coefficient .",
    "the geometric interpretation may enable us to predict the answer for the states given by gsd .",
    "if the center of circumcircle lies in star type area confined by diagonals of the sexangle , then entanglement eigenvalue is the circumradius of the crossed sexangle(s ) .",
    "if the center lies in the remaining part of sexangle , the entanglement eigenvalue is the circumradius of the convex sexangle . and",
    "when the center passes the perimeter , then entanglement eigenvalue is the largest coefficient .",
    "although we can not justify our prediction due to lack of computational technique , this picture surely enables us to take a step toward a deeper understanding of the entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "shared states given by @xmath156 play an important role in quantum information theory .",
    "the application of shared states given by eq.([ss.con - lar ] ) is somewhat questionable , and should be analyzed further .",
    "it should be pointed out that one has to understand the properties of these states and find the possible applications .",
    "we would like to investigate this issue elsewhere .    finally following our procedure",
    ", one can obtain the nearest product state of a given three - parametric w - type state .",
    "these two states will always be separated by a line of densities composed of the convex combination of w - type states and the nearest product states @xcite .",
    "there is a separable density matrix @xmath195 which splits the line into two parts as follows .",
    "one part consists of separable densities and another part consists of non - separable densities .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that an operator @xmath196i$ ] has the properties @xmath197 , and @xmath198 for the arbitrary separable state @xmath199 .",
    "the operator @xmath200 is clearly hermitian and thus is an entanglement witness for the state .",
    "thus our results allow oneself to construct the entanglement witnesses for w - type three qubit states .",
    "however , the explicit derivation of @xmath195 seems to be highly non - trivial @xcite .",
