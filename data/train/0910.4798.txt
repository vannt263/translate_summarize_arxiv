    "we will write @xmath63 as simply @xmath56 , implicitly assuming that an infinitesimal positive shift @xmath62 is used if von neumann bc are used .",

    "we will now treat this problem with the systematic perturbative approach developed in this paper and then perform a comparison with the works mentioned above .",

    "the numerical values corresponding to these plots are reported in table [ table-6 ] : we like to underline that in some cases the ccm may provide tiny splittings for states which are degenerate .",

    "there has been lot of interest in discussing the solutions of quantum mechanical models containing density dependent effective masses , which are common in the description of condensed matter systems .",
    "however most of the efforts have been put into constructing exactly and quasi - exactly solvable potentials for the schrdinger equation with position dependent mass terms  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge perturbation theory has not been used as a tool to construct the solutions to this problem ; since the results obtained earlier in our paper apply straightforwardly to the present case we now extend the approach of section [ subsec2 ] to hamiltonians of the form : = ( - ) + v  .",
    "notice that the stationary schrdinger equation associated to this operator may be solved numerical using the ccm of section [ sec2 ] , with the difference that now @xmath53 is a physical density , not related to a conformal mapping .",

    "no integrals are ever needed to be calculated .",
    "* we prove two theorems which provide explicit formulas for the ground and excited states of a quantum billiard .",

    "* we have formulated a systematic perturbation theory for membranes obtained slightly deforming a square or circular membrane .",

    "the perturbative results discussed in this paper are in most cases very precise and provide a clear and simple explanation of the mechanism responsible for the lifting of degeneracies . for the case of the small deformations of the square , we have obtained an analytical formula for the whole spectrum",
    ". a possible application of our shape perturbation theory could be to the calculation of casimir energies due to deformations of membranes .",
    "in a recent interesting paper , ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , the point matching method has been used to numerically calculate casimir energies for perfect - conductor waveguide of arbitrary section .",
    "our perturbative approach could be useful for analytical calculations .",
    "* the shape perturbation theory of the present paper could be applied to study the statistical distribution of the energy level spacings for quantum billiards obtained from small perturbations of the square or of the circle . in this case",
    "the study would provide an alternative tool to purely numerical methods or to asymptotic methods .",
    "* we have provided a way to extract ( at least in principle ) the perturbative coefficients of the energy of a given level to a specific order .",
    "it would be certainly interesting to study the convergence properties of the perturbative series corresponding to quantum billiards of different shape and see if a relation between the chaotic behaviour of a billiard and the perturbative series could be established . * the analytical results contained in the paper _",
    "are not limited _ to two dimensional membranes , but can be used for problems of higher dimensions ; moreover they can also be applied to describe the spectrum of arbitrary inhomogeneous membranes .",
    "a numerical study of this problem using the ccm has been already performed in @xcite ; we plan to look at this problem with the analytical techniques of the present paper in the near future . here",
    "we have applied our results to hamiltonians containing position dependent effective masses , extending the perturbative approach developed for the helmholtz equation .",
    "we believe that several developments may stem out of the results contained in this paper : among these , it would certainly be worth looking at possible non - perturbative extensions of our shape perturbation method , which we plan to look at in the near future .",
    "similarly , we plan to carry out an extension of the perturbative calculation of this paper to higher orders",
    ". a further interesting application could be to the inverse problem : in a classical paper , kac  @xcite posed the question whether one can hear the sound of a drum , meaning by this if the complete knowledge of the spectrum of a drum is sufficient to determine its shape .",
    "we now know that the answer to this question is negative , since in 1992 gordon , webb and wolpert  @xcite found an example of two two - dimensional not isometric drums which are isospectral . on the other hand , the perturbative formulas obtained in this paper might be used to find the shape of a drum which is obtained from a small deformation of a square or of a circle , knowing a number of frequencies .",
    "finally the last application that we wish to mention is to the vibration of drums with fractal boundaries : refs.@xcite , for example , consider the vibration of a membrane whose border is the koch snowflake .",
    "in particular banjai  @xcite uses a conformal transformation to map the snowflake into the unit circle and then performs a spectral collocation to obtain numerical results .",
    "our perturbative approach , given the conformal map , is directly applicable to this problem and could maybe provide further insight in this problem .",
