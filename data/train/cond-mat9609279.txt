    "before we discuss what happens in the vicinity of a qpt , let us recall some very general features of the statistical mechanics of quantum systems .",
    "the quantities of interest are the partition function of the system , @xmath6 and the expectation values of various operators , @xmath7 in writing these formal expressions we have assumed a finite temperature , @xmath8 .",
    "to get at what happens exactly at @xmath5 we take the @xmath9 limit . upon doing so",
    ", the free energy , @xmath10 , becomes the ground state energy and the various thermal averages become ground state expectation values . from @xmath11",
    "we can get all the thermodynamic quantities of interest .",
    "expectation values of operators of the form @xmath12 are related to the results of dynamical scattering and linear response measurements .",
    "for example , @xmath13 might be the local density ( x - ray scattering ) or current ( electrical transport ) .",
    "let us focus for now on the expression for @xmath11 .",
    "notice that the operator density matrix , @xmath14 , is the same as the time evolution operator , @xmath15 , provided we assign the _ imaginary _",
    "value @xmath16 to the time interval over which the system evolves .",
    "more precisely , when the trace is written in terms of a complete set of states , @xmath17 @xmath11 takes the form of a sum of imaginary time transition amplitudes for the system to start in some state @xmath18 and _ return to the same state _ after an imaginary time interval @xmath19 .",
    "thus we see that calculating the thermodynamics of a quantum system is the same as calculating transition amplitudes for its evolution in imaginary time , the total time interval being fixed by the temperature of interest .",
    "the fact that the time interval happens to be imaginary is not central .",
    "the key idea we hope to transmit to the reader is that eq.([eq : zimag ] ) should evoke an image of quantum dynamics and temporal propagation .    this way of looking at things",
    "can be given a particularly beautiful and practical implementation in the language of feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "feynman s prescription is that the net transition amplitude between two states of the system can be calculated by summing amplitudes for all possible paths between them .",
    "the path taken by the system is defined by specifying the state of the system at a sequence of finely spaced intermediate time steps .",
    "formally we write @xmath20^n,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a time interval to be real , so that the small interval of imaginary time that it represents is @xmath22 . ] which is small on the time scales of interest ( @xmath23 where @xmath24 is some ultraviolet cutoff ) and @xmath25 is a large integer chosen so that @xmath26 .",
    "we then insert a sequence of sums over complete sets of intermediate states into the expression for @xmath27 : @xmath28 this rather messy expression actually has a rather simple physical interpretation .",
    "formally inclined readers will observe that the expression for the _ quantum _ partition function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete_set ] ) has the form of a _ classical _ partition function , i.e. a sum over configurations expressed in terms of a transfer matrix , if we think of imaginary time as an additional spatial dimension .",
    "in particular , if our quantum system lives in @xmath29 dimensions , the expression for its partition function looks like a classical partition function for a system with @xmath30 dimensions , except that the extra dimension is finite in extent@xmath31 in units of time . as @xmath9 the system size in this extra `` time ''",
    "direction diverges and we get a truly @xmath30 dimensional , effective , classical system .",
    "since this equivalence between a @xmath29 dimensional quantum system and a @xmath30 dimensional classical system is crucial to everything else we have to say , and since eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete_set ] ) is probably not very illuminating for readers not used to a daily regimen of transfer matrices , it will be very useful to consider a specific example in order to be able to visualize what eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete_set ] ) means .",
    "consider a one - dimensional array comprising a large number @xmath32 of identical josephson junctions as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : jjdiagram ] ) .",
    "such arrays have recently been studied by by haviland and delsing .",
    "@xcite a josephson junction is a tunnel junction connecting two superconducting metallic grains .",
    "cooper pairs of electrons are able to tunnel back and forth between the grains and hence communicate information about the quantum state on each grain .",
    "if the cooper pairs are able to move freely from grain to grain throughout the array , the system is a superconductor .",
    "if the grains are very small however , it costs a large charging energy to move an excess cooper pair onto a grain .",
    "if this energy is large enough , the cooper pairs fail to propagate and become stuck on individual grains , causing the system to be an insulator .",
    "the essential degrees of freedom in this system are the phases of the complex superconducting order parameter on the metallic elements connected by the junctions and their conjugate variables , the charges ( excess cooper pairs , or equivalently the voltages ) on each grain .",
    "the intermediate state @xmath33 at time @xmath34 , that enters the quantum partition function eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete_set ] ) , can thus be defined by specifying the set of phase angles @xmath35 $ ] .",

    "the @xmath42 s appearing in the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : h6 ] ) are angular coordinate operators and @xmath40 is a site label .",
    "the state at time slice @xmath41 is an eigenfunction of these operators : @xmath43 ; @xmath44 is conjugate to the phase has @xmath45 units of angular momentum representing @xmath45 _ excess _",

    "the cooper - pair number operator in this representation is @xmath46 .",

    "note that the potential energy of the bosons is represented , somewhat paradoxically , by the kinetic energy of the quantum rotors and vice versa . ] and is the voltage on the @xmath40th junction , and @xmath47 is the josephson coupling energy .",
    "the two terms in the hamiltonian then represent the charging energy of each grain and the josephson coupling of the phase across the junction between grains .    as indicated previously",
    ", we can map the quantum statistical mechanics of the array onto classical statistical mechanics by identifying the the statistical weight of a space - time path in eq .",
    "( [ eq : statwgt ] ) with the boltzmann weight of a two - dimensional spatial configuration of a classical system . in this case",
    "the classical system is therefore a _ two - dimensional _ x - y model , i.e. its degrees of freedom are planar spins , specified by angles @xmath48 , that live on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "( recall that at temperatures above zero , the lattice has a finite width @xmath49 in the temporal direction . ) while the degrees of freedom are easily identified , finding the classical hamiltonian for this x - y model is somewhat more work and requires an explicit evaluation of the matrix elements which interested readers can find in the appendix .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that , in an approximation that preserves the universality class of the problem , the product of matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : statwgt ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath50 where the hamiltonian of the equivalent classical x - y model is @xmath51 and the sum runs over near - neighbor points in the _ two - dimensional _",

    "the nearest neighbor character of the couplings identifies the classical model as _ the _ 2d x - y model , extensively studied in the context of superfluid and superconducting films @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that while the straightforward identification of the degrees of freedom of the classical model in this example is robust , this simplicity of the resulting classical hamiltonian is something of a minor miracle .",
    "it is essential to note that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath52 in @xmath53 , which plays the role of the temperature in the classical model , depends on the ratio of the capacitive charging energy @xmath54 to the josephson coupling @xmath47 in the array , @xmath55 and has nothing to do with the physical temperature .",
    "( see appendix . )",
    "the physics here is that a large josephson coupling produces a small value of @xmath52 which favors coherent ordering of the phases .",
    "that is , small @xmath52 makes it unlikely that @xmath48 and @xmath56 will differ significantly , even when sites @xmath57 and @xmath40 are far apart ( in space and/or time ) .",
    "conversely , a large charging energy leads to a large value of @xmath52 which favors zero - point fluctuations of the phases and disorders the system .",
    "that is , large @xmath52 means that the @xmath58 s are nearly independent and all values are nearly equally likely . ] , a state of indefinite phase on a site has definite charge on that site , as would be expected for an insulator . ]",
    "finally , we note that this equivalence generalizes to d - dimensional arrays and d+1-dimensional classical xy models .",
    "this specific example of the equivalence between a quantum system and a classical system with an extra ` temporal ' dimension , illustrates several general correspondences between quantum systems and their effective classical analogs .",
    "standard lore tells us that the classical xy model has an order - disorder phase transition as its temperature @xmath52 is varied .",
    "it follows that the quantum array has a phase transition as the ratio of its charging and josephson energies is varied .",
    "one can thus see why it is said that the superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition in a 1-dimensional josephson junction array is in the same universality class as the order - disorder phase transition of the 1 + 1-dimensional classical xy model .",
    "[ one crucial caveat is that the xy model universality class has strict particle - hole symmetry for the bosons ( cooper pairs ) on each site . in reality ,",
    "josephson junction arrays contain random ` offset charges ' which destroy this symmetry and change the universality class @xcite , a fact which is all too often overlooked . ]",
    "we emphasize again that @xmath52 is the temperature only in the effective classical problem . in the quantum case ,",
    "the physical temperature is presumed to be nearly zero and only enters as the finite size of the system in the imaginary time direction . _ the coupling constant @xmath52 , the fake ` temperature , ' is a measure not of thermal fluctuations , but of the strength of quantum fluctuations , or zero point motion of the phase variables_. this notion is quite confusing , so the reader might be well advised to pause here and contemplate it further",
    ". it may be useful to examine fig .",
    "( [ fig : two - sizes ] ) , where we show a space time lattice for the xy model corresponding to a josephson junction array at a certain temperature , and at a temperature half as large .",
    "the size of the lattice constant in the time direction [ @xmath21 in the path integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete_set ] ) ] and @xmath52 are the _ same _ in both cases even though the physical temperature is not the same .",
    "the only difference is that one lattice is larger in the time direction than the other .    in developing intuition about this picture",
    ", it may be helpful to see how classical physics is recovered at very high temperatures . in that limit , the time interval @xmath59 is very short compared to the periods associated with the natural frequency scales in the system and typical time histories will consist of a single static configuration which is the same at each time slice .",
    "the dynamics therefore drops out of the problem and a boltzmann weight @xmath60 is recovered from the path integral .",
    "the thermodynamic phases of the array can be identified from those of the xy model .",
    "a small value of @xmath52 corresponds to low temperature in the classical system and so the quantum system will be in the ordered ferromagnetic phase of the xy model , as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : jjpath ] ) .",
    "there will be long - range correlations in both space and time of the phase variables .",
    "this indicates that the josephson coupling dominates over the charging energy , and the order parameter is not fluctuating wildly in space or time so that the system is in the _ superconducting _ phase . for large @xmath52 ,",
    "the system is disordered and the order parameter fluctuates wildly . the correlations decay exponentially in space and time as illustrated in fig .  ( [ fig : jjpath2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the system is in the _ insulating _ phase , where the charging energy dominates over the josephson coupling energy .",
    "why can we assert that correlations which decay exponentially in imaginary time indicate an excitation gap characteristic of an insulator ?",
    "this is readily seen by noting that the heisenberg representation of an operator in imaginary time is @xmath61 and so the ( ground state ) correlation function for any operator can be expressed in terms of a complete set of states as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the energy of the @xmath64th excited state .",
    "the existence of a finite minimum excitation gap @xmath65 guarantees that for long ( imaginary ) times the correlation function will decay exponentially , and for very long times ( comparable to @xmath59 ) , the finiteness in the time direction will modify this result .",
    "also , we implicitly assume here that @xmath66 . ]",
    "i.e. , @xmath67    to recapitulate , we have managed to map the finite temperature 1d quantum problem into a 2d classical problem with one finite dimension that diverges as @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter that controls the fluctuations in the effective classical problem does _ not _ involve @xmath68 , but instead is a measure of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the classical model exhibits two phases , one ordered and one disordered .",
    "these correspond to the superconducting and insulating phases in the quantum problem .",
    "in the former the zero - point or quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are small . in the latter they are large .",
    "the set of analogies developed here between quantum and classical critical systems is summarized in table  [ tablea ] .",
    "besides the beautiful formal properties of the analogy between the quantum path integral and @xmath30 dimensional statistical mechanics , there are very practical advantages to this analogy . in many cases , particularly for systems without disorder , the universality class of the quantum transition is one that has already been studied extensively classically and a great deal may already be known about it . for new universality classes ,",
    "it is possible to do the quantum mechanics by classical monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations of the appropriate @xmath30-dimensional model .",
    "finally , there is a special feature of our particular example that should be noted . in this case",
    "the quantum system , the 1d josephson junction array ( which is also the 1d quantum x - y model ) , has mapped onto a classical model in which space and time enter in the same fashion , i.e. , the isotropic 2d classical x - y model .",
    "consequently , the dynamical exponent @xmath69 ( to be defined below ) is unity .",
    "this is not true in general  depending upon the quantum kinetics , the coupling in the time direction can have a very different form and the effective classical system is then intrinsically anisotropic and not so simply related to the starting quantum system .",
    "we end this account of quantum statistical mechanics by commenting on the relationship between dynamics and thermodynamics . in classical statistical mechanics ,",
    "dynamics and thermodynamics are separable , i.e. , the momentum and position sums in the partition function are totally independent . for example , we do not need to know the mass of the particles to compute their positional correlations . in writing down simple non - dynamical models ,",
    "e.g. the ising model , we typically take advantage of this simplicity .",
    "this freedom is lost in the quantum problem because coordinates and momenta do not commute .",
    "classically only requires knowledge of the form of the hamiltonian function and not of the equations of motion , while both enter the quantum calculation .",
    "recall that @xmath70 alone does not fix the equations of motion ; one also needs the poisson brackets / commutators among the phase space variables .",
    "while these determine the classical oscillation frequencies , they do not enter the classical calculation of @xmath11 . in quantum mechanics",
    "@xmath71 times the classical oscillation frequencies yields the energy level spacing .",
    "hence the commutators are needed to find the eigenvalues of the quantum @xmath70 needed to compute the quantum @xmath11 . ]",
    "it is for this reason that our path integral expression for @xmath11 contains information on the imaginary time evolution of the system over the interval @xmath36 $ ] , and , with a little bit of care , that information can be used to get the dynamics in real time by the analytic continuation , @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qmcorr ] ) . stating it in reverse",
    ", one can not solve for the thermodynamics without also solving for the dynamics  a feature that makes quantum statistical mechanics more interesting but that much harder to do !    heuristically , the existence of @xmath71 implies that energy scales that enter thermodynamics necessarily determine time scales which then enter the dynamics and vice - versa .",
    "consider the effect of a characteristic energy scale , such as a gap @xmath73 , in the spectrum . by the uncertainty principle",
    "there will be virtual excitations across this gap on a time scale @xmath74 , which will appear as the characteristic time scale for the dynamics .",
    "close to the critical point , where @xmath73 vanishes , and at finite temperature this argument gets modified  the relevant uncertainty in the energy is now @xmath75 and the characteristic time scale is @xmath59 . in either case , the linkage between dynamics and thermodynamics is clear .",
    "we now turn our attention to the immediate neighborhood of a quantum critical point . in this region",
    "the mapping of the quantum system to a d+1 dimensional classical model will allow us to make powerful general statements about the former using the extensive lore on critical behavior in the latter .",
    "hence most of the following will consist of a reinterpretation of standard ideas in classical statistical mechanics in terms appropriate for @xmath30 dimensions , where the extra dimension is imaginary time .      in the vicinity of a continuous quantum phase transition we will find several features of interest .",
    "first , we will find a correlation length that diverges as the transition is approached .",
    "that diverging correlation lengths are a generic feature of classical critical points , immediately tells us that diverging lengths and diverging _ times _ are automatically a generic feature of quantum critical points , since one of the directions in the d+1 dimensional space is time .",
    "this makes sense from the point of view of causality .",
    "it _ should _ take a longer and longer time to propagate information across the distance of the correlation length .",
    "actually , we have to be careful  as we remarked earlier , the time direction might easily involve a different set of interactions than the spatial directions , leading to a distinct correlation `` length '' in the time direction .",
    "we will call the latter @xmath76 , reserving the symbol @xmath77 for the spatial correlation length .",
    "generically , at @xmath5 both @xmath78 and @xmath79 diverge as @xmath80 in the manner , @xmath81 these asymptotic forms serve to define the correlation length exponent @xmath82 , and the _ dynamical scaling _ exponent , @xmath69 .",
    "the nomenclature is historical , referring to the extension of scaling ideas from the study of static classical critical phenomena to dynamics in the critical region associated with critical slowing down @xcite . in the classical problem",
    "the extension was a non - trivial step , deserving of a proper label .",
    "as remarked before , the quantum problem involves statics and dynamics on the same footing and so nothing less is possible . for the case of the josephson junction array",
    "considered previously , we found the simplest possible result , @xmath83 .",
    "as noted however this is a special isotropic case and in general , @xmath84 .    as a consequence of the diverging @xmath77 and @xmath76 , it turns out that various physical quantities in the critical region close to the transition have ( _ dynamic _ ) _ scaling forms _ , i.e. their dependence on the independent variables involves homogeneity relations of the form : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is called the scaling dimension of the observable @xmath87 measured at wavevector @xmath88 and frequency @xmath89 .",
    "the meaning of ( and assumption behind ) these scaling forms is simply that , close to the critical point , there is no characteristic length scale other than @xmath77 itself and no characteristic time scale other than @xmath76 .",
    "thus the specific value of the coupling @xmath52 does not appear explicitly on the rhs of eq.([eq : homogen ] ) .",
    "it is present only implicitly through the @xmath52 dependence of @xmath77 and @xmath76 .    if we specialize to the scale invariant critical point , the scaling form in eq.([eq : homogen ] )",
    "is no longer applicable since the correlation length and times have diverged to infinity . in this case",
    "the only characteristic length left is the wavelength @xmath90 at which the measurement is being made , whence the only characteristic frequency is @xmath91 . as a result",
    "we find the simpler scaling form : @xmath92 reflecting the presence of _ quantum _ fluctuations on all length and time scales . ) must for large arguments @xmath93 have the form @xmath94 in order for the observable to have a sensible limit as the critical point is approached . ]",
    "the utility and power of these scaling forms can be illustrated by the following example . in an ordinary classical system at a critical point in @xmath29 dimensions where the correlation length has diverged",
    ", the correlations of many operators typically fall off as a power law @xmath95 so that the fourier transform diverges at small wavevectors like @xmath96 suppose that we are interested in a qpt for which the d+1-dimensional classical system is effectively isotropic and the dynamical exponent @xmath83 .",
    "then the fourier transform of the correlation function for the @xmath30-dimensional problem is @xmath97^{-2+\\eta_{d+1}},\\ ] ] where the @xmath30 component of the ` wavevector ' is simply the matsubara frequency used to fourier transform in the time direction .",
    "analytic continuation to real frequencies via the usual prescription @xcite @xmath98 yields the retarded correlation function @xmath99^{(-2+\\eta_{d+1})/2}. \\label{eq : branchcut}\\ ] ] instead of a pole at the frequency of some coherently oscillating collective mode , we see instead that @xmath100 has a branch cut for frequencies above @xmath101 ( we have implicitly set the characteristic velocity to unity ) .",
    "thus we see that there is no characteristic frequency other than @xmath88 itself ( in general , @xmath102 as in eq.([eq : homogen_crit ] ) ) , as we discussed above .",
    "this implies that collective modes have become overdamped and the system is in an incoherent diffusive regime .",
    "the review by sachdev contains some specific examples which nicely illustrate these points @xcite .    finally , three comments are in order .",
    "first , as we saw in the example of the josephson junction array , a finite temporal correlation length means that there is a gap in the spectrum of the quantum problem .",
    "conversely , critical systems are gapless .",
    "second , the exponent @xmath69 is a measure of how skewed time is , relative to space , in the _ critical _ region .",
    "this does not , _ a priori _ , have anything to do with what happens in either of the phases .",
    "for example , one should resist the temptation to deduce the value of @xmath69 via @xmath103 from the dispersion of any goldstone mode in the ordered phase .",
    "this is incorrect since the exponent @xmath69 is a property of the critical point itself , not of the ordered phase .",
    "third , we should restate the well known wisdom that the diverging lengths and the associated scaling of physical quantities are particularly interesting because they represent _ universal _ behavior , i.e. , behavior insensitive to microscopic details within certain global constraints such as symmetry and dimensionality @xcite .",
    "so far we have described the framework , appropriate to the system at @xmath5 , that would describe the underlying qpt in any system . as the experimentally accessible behavior of the system necessarily involves a non - zero temperature , we need to understand how to modify the scaling forms of the previous section for the @xmath104 problem .    the crucial observation for this purpose is , as noted earlier and illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : two - sizes ] ) , that the _ only _ effect of taking @xmath104 in the partition function ( [ eq : complete_set ] ) is to make the temporal dimension _ finite _ ; in particular , there is no change in the coupling @xmath52 with physical temperature .",
    "the effective classical system now resembles a hyper - slab with @xmath29 spatial dimensions ( taken to be infinite in extent ) and one temporal dimension of size @xmath105 .",
    "as phase transitions depend sensitively upon the dimensionality of the system , we expect the finiteness of @xmath106 to modify the critical behavior , since at the longest length scales the system is now @xmath29 dimensional .",
    "this modification can take two forms .",
    "first , it can destroy the transition entirely so that the only critical point is at @xmath5 .",
    "this happens in the case of the 1d josephson array .",
    "its finite temperature physics is that of an xy model on an infinite strip which , being a one dimensional classical system with short - range forces , is disordered at all finite values of @xmath52 ( finite temperatures in the classical language ) .    in the second form , the modification is such that the transition persists to @xmath104 but crosses over to a different universality class .",
    "for example , the problem of a 2d josephson junction array maps onto a 3(@xmath1072 + 1 ) dimensional classical xy model .",
    "its phase diagram is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) . at @xmath5 the qpt for the transition from superconductor to insulator",
    "is characterized by the exponents of the 3d xy model .",
    "that is , it looks just like the classical lambda transition in liquid helium with @xmath108 playing the role of @xmath109 in the helium .",
    "however at @xmath104 the system is effectively two dimensional and undergoes a transition of the 2d kosterlitz - thouless xy variety at a new , smaller , value of @xmath52 , much like a helium film .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition occurs on the solid line in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "we see that it is necessary to reduce the quantum fluctuations ( by making @xmath52 smaller ) in order to allow the system to order at finite temperatures . above some critical temperature",
    ", the system will become disordered ( via the kt mechanism ) owing to thermal fluctuations .",
    "of course , if we make @xmath52 _ larger _ the quantum fluctuations are then so large that the system does not order at any temperature , even zero .",
    "the region on the @xmath52 axis ( i.e. , at @xmath5 ) to the right of the qcp in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) represents the quantum disordered superconductor , that is , the insulator . at finite temperatures ,",
    "no system with a finite gap is ever truly insulating .",
    "however there is a crossover regime , illustrated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) separating the regimes where the temperature is smaller and larger than the gap .    at this point",
    "the reader might wonder how one learns anything at all about the qpt if the effects of temperature are so dramatic .",
    "the answer is that even though the finiteness of @xmath106 causes a _ crossover _ away from the @xmath5 behavior , sufficiently close to the @xmath5 critical point , it does so in a fashion controlled by the physics at that critical point .",
    "this is not an unfamiliar assertion . in the language of the renormalization group ,",
    "critical points are always unstable fixed points and lead to scaling not because they decide where the system ends up but because they control how `` long '' it takes to get there . here , instead of moving the system away from the critical fixed point by tuning a parameter",
    ", we do so by reducing its dimensionality .",
    "since the physics has to be continuous in temperature , the question arises of how large the temperature has to be before the system ` knows ' that its dimension has been reduced . the answer to this",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : finite - size ] ) . when the coupling @xmath52 is far away from the zero - temperature critical coupling @xmath110 the correlation length @xmath77 is not large and the corresponding correlation time @xmath111 is small . as long as the correlation time is smaller than the system ` thickness ' @xmath31",
    ", the system does not realize that the temperature is finite .",
    "that is , the characteristic fluctuation frequencies obey @xmath112 and so are quantum mechanical in nature .",
    "however as the critical coupling is approached , the correlation time grows and eventually exceeds @xmath59 .",
    "( more precisely , the correlation time that the system would have had at zero temperature exceeds @xmath59 ; the actual fluctuation correlation time is thus limited by temperature . ) at this point the system ` knows ' that the temperature is finite and realizes that it is now effectively a @xmath29-dimensional classical system rather than a @xmath30-dimensional system .",
    "the formal theory of the effect of reduced dimensionality near critical points , which quantifies the above considerations , is called _ finite size scaling _ @xcite . for our problem",
    "it asserts that for @xmath113/k_{\\rm c } \\ll 1 $ ] and @xmath9 , physical quantities have the finite size scaling form , @xmath114 the interpretation of this form is the following . the quantity @xmath115 defined above leads , as discussed in more detail below , to a characteristic length @xmath116 associated with the temperature .",
    "hence the prefactor @xmath117 is the analog of the corresponding prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : homogen ] ) . this same characteristic length is the only one against which to measure the wave vector @xmath88 .",
    "the associated time @xmath106 is the time scale against which to measure the frequency in the second term .",
    "finally the distance to the zero temperature critical coupling is measured via the ratio of @xmath106 to the zero temperature correlation time @xmath76 .",
    "the message here is that what matters is the ratio of the finite size in the time direction to the @xmath5 correlation length in that direction .",
    "we will return to the uses of this form shortly .",
    "our considerations in this section also show us why the phase boundary in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) ( solid line ) and the crossover line ( dashed line ) reach zero temperature in a singular way as the quantum critical point is approached .",
    "simple dimensional analysis tells us that the characteristic energy scale ( @xmath73 for the insulator , @xmath118 for the superfluid ) vanishes near the critical point like @xmath119 , implying @xmath120      we now turn to a somewhat different understanding and interpretation of the effect of temperature that is conceptually of great importance . recall that the @xmath5 critical points of interest to us are gapless and scale invariant , i.e. , they have quantum fluctuations at all frequencies down to zero .",
    "temperature introduces a new energy scale into the problem .",
    "modes whose frequencies are larger than @xmath121 are largely unaffected , while those with frequencies lower than @xmath121 become occupied by many quanta with the consequence that they behave _ classically_. put differently , the temperature cuts off coherent quantum fluctuations in the infrared .",
    "what we want to show next is that this existence of a quantum to classical crossover frequency ( @xmath121 ) leads to an associated length scale for the same crossover , as alluded to in the previous section .",
    "we shall refer to this length scale as the dephasing length , @xmath122 , associated with the qpt .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath122 is easy enough to calculate .",
    "from our imaginary time formalism we recall that quantum fluctuations are fluctuations in the temporal direction .",
    "evidently these can not be longer - ranged than the size of the system in the time direction , @xmath123 . since spatial and temporal correlations are linked via @xmath111 , it follows that the spatial correlations _ linked _ with quantum fluctuations are not longer ranged than @xmath124 . since the spatial range of quantum fluctuations is the dephasing length , we find @xmath125 .",
    "we use the term `` dephasing '' deliberately .",
    "readers may know , from other contexts where quantum effects are observed , that such observation requires _ phase coherence _ for the relevant degrees of freedom . in other words , interference terms should not be wiped out by interactions with an `` environment '' , i.e. other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "if dephasing takes place and the phase coherence is lost , the resulting behavior is classical .",
    "thus our definition of @xmath122 is in line with that notion .",
    "however , readers familiar with the notion of a dephasing length , @xmath126 , in mesoscopic condensed matter physics or the theory of anderson localization , might be concerned at our appropriation of this notion .",
    "the concern arises because , in the standard lore in those fields , one is often dealing with models of non - interacting or even interacting electrons , whose quantum coherence is limited by degrees of freedom , e.g. phonons , that are not being considered explicitly .",
    "this has given rise to a tradition of thinking of @xmath126 as being a length which is set _",
    "externally_. unfortunately this sort of separation of degrees of freedom should _ not _ be expected to work near a qpt , since there one needs to keep track of all _ relevant _ interactions .",
    "if a given interaction , e.g. the coulomb interaction , is relevant , then it already sits in the hamiltonian we need to solve and enters the calculation of @xmath122 .",
    "in contrast , if an interaction , e.g. coupling to phonons , is irrelevant then we do not expect it to enter the low energy physics as it should not in general affect the quantum - classical crossover either .    another way of formulating this is in terms of dephasing _",
    "rates_. since temperature is the only energy scale available , a generic quantum critical point will be characterized by a dephasing rate @xmath127 that is linear in @xmath68 , since we expect @xmath128 . by definition , irrelevant interactions , e.g. phonons , have an effective coupling to the electrons which scales away to zero as one examines the system on larger length and time scales .",
    "hence such couplings will produce a dephasing rate which vanishes as @xmath129 with @xmath130 and will therefore become negligible compared to @xmath68 at low temperatures . as @xmath9 and",
    "hence will not control the quantum - classical crossover of the relevant degrees of freedom , since it is the shortest length that counts .",
    "there are times when this sort of reasoning can break down .",
    "these situations involve operators that are irrelevant , i.e. , decrease in the infrared , but can not be naively set to zero since that produces extra singularities .",
    "such operators are known in the trade as `` dangerous irrelevant operators '' and we will meet an example in the next section , in the context of current scaling . ]    thus we conclude that @xmath122 is the _",
    "unique _ dephasing length in the vicinity of a generic quantum critical point .",
    "further discussion and explicit examples of the dissipative dynamics near a critical point can be found in the article by sachdev ( 1996 ) .",
    "we now turn from our somewhat abstract considerations to examples of how one actually looks for a qpt in experiments .",
    "the basic idea is relatively simple .",
    "we try to arrange that the system is close to the conjectured critical point in parameter space ( @xmath131 ) and temperature ( @xmath132 ) and look for mutually consistent evidence of scaling with various _",
    "relevant parameters_. by these we mean either the deviation of the quantum coupling constant from its critical value @xmath133 , the temperature , or the wavevector , frequency and amplitude of a probe .",
    "we call these relevant parameters since when they are non - zero the response of the system has no critical singularities due to the quantum critical point  hence the analogy to relevant operators in renormalization group theory",
    ". additionally , we can look for universal critical amplitudes or amplitude ratios that are implicit in scaling forms for various quantities .    to see how this works",
    ", we will consider as a specific example , a set of recent experiments on phase transitions in quantum hall systems .",
    "we derive various scaling relations appropriate to the experiments , even though we do not actually know the correct theory describing the qpt in this disordered , interacting fermi system .",
    "the very generality of the scaling arguments we will apply implies that one need not have a detailed microscopic understanding of the physics to extract useful information .",
    "nevertheless , we will start with some introductory background for readers unfamiliar with the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is a property of a two dimensional electron system placed in a strong transverse magnetic field , @xmath134 .",
    "these systems are produced , using modern semiconductor fabrication techniques , at the interface of two semiconductors with different band gaps .",
    "the electronic motion perpendicular to the interface is confined to a potential well @xmath135  thick . because the well is so thin , the minimum excitation energy perpendicular to the 2d plane ( @xmath136k ) is much larger than the temperature ( @xmath137k ) and so motion in this third dimension is frozen out , leaving the system dynamically two - dimensional .",
    "as the ratio of the density to the magnetic field is varied at @xmath5 , the electrons condense into a remarkable sequence of distinct thermodynamic phases .",
    "these phases are most strikingly characterized by their unique electrical transport properties , as illustrated in fig  ( [ fig : qhdata ] ) . within each phase",
    "the current flow is dissipationless , in that the longitudinal resistivity , @xmath138 , that gives the electric field along the direction of current flow ( @xmath139 ) vanishes . at the same time that the longitudinal resistivity vanishes , the hall resistivity , @xmath140 , that gives the electric field transverse to the direction of current flow ( @xmath141 ) becomes quantized in rational multiples of the quantum of resistance @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an integer or simple rational fraction which serves to distinguish between the different phases .",
    "this quantization has been verified to an accuracy of about one part in @xmath144 and to an even higher precision .",
    "the qhe arises from a commensuration between electron density and magnetic flux density , i.e. a sharp lowering of the energy when their ratio , the filling factor @xmath143 , takes on particular rational values .",
    "this commensuration is equivalent to the existence of an energy gap in the excitation spectrum at these `` magic '' filling factors and leads to dissipationless flow at @xmath5 since degrading a small current requires making arbitrarily small energy excitations which are unavailable . in the absence of disorder , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : qhallr ] ) follows straightforwardly , for example by invoking galilean invariance @xcite . as the magnetic field ( or density ) is varied away from the magic filling factor , it is no longer possible for the system to maintain commensuration over its entire area , and it is forced to introduce a certain density of defects to take up the discommensuration . in the presence of disorder , these defects , which are the quasiparticles of the system , become localized and do not contribute to the resistivities , which remain at their magic values . in this fashion",
    ", we get a qh phase or a plateau .",
    "transitions between qh phases occur when too many quasiparticles have been introduced into the original qh state and it becomes energetically favorable to move to the `` basin of attraction '' of a different state and its associated defects .",
    "it might appear that these transitions between neighboring phases are first order , since @xmath140 jumps discontinuously by a discrete amount between them , but they are not .",
    "qualitatively , they involve the quasiparticles of each phase which are localized on a length scale , the localization length , that diverges as the transition is approached from either side .",
    "however , as these quasiparticles are always localized at the longest length scale away from criticality , they do not lead to dissipation ( @xmath145 ) and do not renormalize the hall resistivities of their respective phases .",
    "exactly at the transition they are delocalized and lead to a non - zero @xmath138 .",
    "the shift in @xmath140 on moving through the transition can be understood in terms of either set of quasiparticles condensing into a fluid state  there being an underlying duality in this description .    in our description of the qh phases and phase transitions we have employed a common language for all of them .",
    "we should note that this does not , _ ipso facto _ imply that all quantum hall transitions are in the same universality class ; however , experiments , as we discuss later , do seem to suggest that conclusion .",
    "the reason for this caution is that different qh states can arise from quite different physics at the microscopic level .",
    "states with integer @xmath143 arise , to first approximation , from single particle physics .",
    "an electron in a plane can occupy a _",
    "landau level _ which comprises a set of degenerate states with energy @xmath146 ; these reflect the quantization of the classical cyclotron motion having frequency @xmath147 and the arbitrariness of the location of that motion in the plane .",
    "when an integer number of landau levels are full , and this corresponds to an integer filling factor , excitations involve the promotion of an electron across the cyclotron gap and we have the commensuration / gap nexus necessary for the observation of the ( integer ) qhe .",
    "in contrast , fractional filling factors imply fractional occupations of the landau levels , with attendant macrosopic degeneracies , and they exhibit a gap only when the coulomb interaction between the electrons is taken into account ( the fractional qhe ) .",
    "readers interested in the details of this magic trick are encouraged to peruse the literature .    before proceeding to the details of experiments , we need to discuss two important points about the units of the quantities measured in electrical transport where two spatial dimensions are rather special .",
    "experiments measure resistances , which are ratios of total voltages to current and these are related to local resistivities by ratios of cross - sectional `` areas '' to lengths . in two dimensions , a cross - sectional area _",
    "is _ a length and consequently no factor of length intervenes between the global and local quantities . in the qh phases",
    ", this has the important implication that _ no _ geometrical factor affects the measurement of the hall resistance , which is why the ratio of fundamental constants @xmath148 and hence the fine structure constant can be measured to high accuracy on samples whose geometry is certainly not known to an accuracy of one part in @xmath144 .",
    "what we have said above is a statement about the engineering dimensions of resistance and resistivity .",
    "remarkably , this also has an analog when it comes to their _ scaling _ dimensions at a quantum critical point , i.e. their scaling dimensions vanish .",
    "consequently , the resistivities vary as the zeroth power of the diverging correlation length on approaching the transition , i.e. will remain constant on either side . precisely at criticality",
    "they will be independent of the length scale used to define them but can take values distinct from the neighboring phases .    in this fashion , we have recovered from a purely scaling argument our earlier conclusion that even though the quantum hall transitions are continuous , the resistivities at @xmath5 differ from the quantized values _ only _ at critical points .",
    "detecting the continuous transitions then requires measurements at a non - zero temperature , frequency or current , all of which lead to a more gradual variation which can then be examined for scaling behavior .",
    "below are some examples of how that works .",
    "consider the caricature of a typical set of data shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : tdata ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath140 interpolates between its quantized values over a transition region of non - zero width , while @xmath138 is peaked in the same region , but is extremely small outside the region .",
    "the change in the shape of these curves with temperature can be understood on the basis of the finite size scaling form @xmath149 where @xmath150 measures the distance to the zero temperature critical point .",
    "this form is equivalent to the general finite - size scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finite_scaling ] ) except that we have assumed the limit @xmath151 , and used the previously cited result that the scaling dimension of the resistivity vanishes in @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "the first argument in the scaling function here is the same as the second in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finite_scaling ] ) .",
    "the second argument in the scaling function here is simply a power of the third argument in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finite_scaling ] ) .",
    "this change is inconsequential ; it can be simply absorbed into a redefinition of the scaling function .",
    "first , let us consider a dc or @xmath153 measurement .",
    "in this case our scaling form implies that the resistivities are not independent functions of @xmath154 ( or @xmath155 ) and @xmath68 but instead are functions of the single _ scaling variable _ @xmath156 .",
    "hence the effect of lowering @xmath68 is to rescale the deviation of the field from its critical value by the factor @xmath157 .",
    "it follows that the transition appears sharper and sharper as the temperature is lowered , its width vanishing as a universal power of the temperature , @xmath158 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : wei - data ] ) we show the pioneering data of wei _ et al . _",
    "( 1988 ) that indeed shows such an algebraic dependence for several different transitions all of which yield the value @xmath159 .",
    "these transitions are between integer quantum hall states .",
    "remarkably , this temperature scaling behavior seems to be ubiquitous at quantum hall transitions and suggests that there is a single underlying fixed point for all of them .",
    "it was shown by engel _",
    "( 1990 ) that it holds at transitions between two fractional quantum hall states .",
    "subsequently , wong _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) found the same scaling for the transition between a hall state and the insulator . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : shahar - data ] ) we show some recent data of shahar ( 1995 ) near another such transition , plotted both as a function of the magnetic field at several values of @xmath68 , and against the scaling variable @xmath156 , exhibiting the data collapse characteristic of the critical region .",
    "consider now the results of measurements at non - zero frequencies . in their full generality",
    "these require a two variable scaling analysis @xcite but we focus instead on two distinct regimes .",
    "in the regime @xmath160 we expect that the behavior of the scaling function will be governed by its @xmath161 limit analyzed previously , i.e. at small @xmath89 we expect the scaling to be dominated by @xmath68 . in the second regime ,",
    "@xmath162 , we expect the scaling to be dominated by @xmath89 and the scaling function to be independent of @xmath68 . in order for the temperature to drop out , the scaling function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoscaling ] ) must have the form @xmath163 for large @xmath164 so that the scaling variables conspire to appear in the combination , @xmath165 it follows that at high frequencies the resistivities are functions of the scaling variable @xmath166 and that the width of the transition regions scales as @xmath167 .",
    "( [ fig : engel - data ] ) shows frequency dependent conductivity data of engel _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) which exhibits this algebraic increase in the width of the transition region with frequency and yields a value of @xmath168 consistent with the temperature scaling .",
    "we should note an important point here . as the ratio @xmath169 is varied in a given experiment",
    "we expect to see a crossover between the @xmath68 and @xmath89 dominated scaling regimes .",
    "the criterion for this crossover is @xmath170 .",
    "the observation by engel _",
    "( 1990 ) , that this is indeed the correct crossover criterion ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : engel - data ] ) ) is important for two reasons .",
    "first , it involves @xmath71 and clearly implies that _ quantum _ effects are at issue .",
    "second it implies that @xmath68 is the relevant infrared scale .",
    "if dephasing effects coming from coupling to some irrelevant degree of freedom were important , one would expect the crossover to take place when @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is some microscopic scattering or relaxation rate associated with this coupling .",
    "since the coupling is irrelevant it will , as noted earlier , give a scattering rate that vanishes as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is greater than unity and @xmath13 is non - universal @xcite ( e.g. , it depends on the precise value of the electron - phonon coupling constant for the material ) .",
    "in contrast , what is observed is that the relaxation rate obeys @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a _ universal _",
    "@xcite dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "it is important to note that frequency scaling does not give us any new information on exponents that we did not already have from the temperature scaling .",
    "the main import of frequency scaling is its ability to confirm the quantum critical nature of the transition by showing that the characteristic time scales have diverged , leaving the temperature itself as the only frequency scale .",
    "a third relevant parameter that is experimentally useful is the magnitude of the measuring current or , equivalently , of the applied electric field .",
    "in talking about resistivities we have assumed that there is an ohmic regime at small currents , i.e. , a regime in which the voltages are linear in the current . in general , there is no reason to believe that the non - linear response can be related to equilibrium properties  i.e .",
    ", there is no fluctuation - dissipation theorem beyond the linear regime .",
    "however , in the vicinity of a critical point we expect the dominant non - linearities to come from critical fluctuations . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the electric field scale for these can be estimated from an essentially dimensional argument .",
    "we start by defining a characteristic length @xmath177 associated with the electric field .",
    "imagine that the system is at the critical point so that @xmath177 is the only length scale available .",
    "then the only characteristic time for fluctuations of the system will scale like @xmath178 .",
    "we can relate the length @xmath177 to the electric field that produces it by @xmath179 this expression simply equates the energy gained from the electric field by an electron moving a distance @xmath177 to the characteristic energy of the equilibrium system at that same scale .",
    "thus @xmath180 if the system is not precisely at the critical point , then it is this length @xmath177 that we should compare to the correlation length @xmath181 from this we find that the non - linear dc resistivities for a 2d system obey the scaling forms @xmath182 this is a very useful result because it tells us that electric field scaling will give us new information not available from temperature scaling alone . from temperature",
    "scaling we can measure the combination of exponents @xmath168 . because an electric field requires multiplication by one power of the correlation length to convert it to a temperature ( energy ) , electric field scaling measures the combination of exponents @xmath183 .",
    "thus the two measurements can be combined to separately determine @xmath82 and @xmath69 .",
    "the data of wei _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , fig .",
    "( [ fig : wei - idata ] ) , confirm this and yield the value @xmath184 . together",
    "the @xmath68 , @xmath89 and @xmath185 scaling experiments lead to the assignment @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "equation  ( [ current_scaling1 ] ) tells us that there are two scaling regimes . at sufficiently high temperatures , @xmath188 and the scaling",
    "is controlled by the temperature . below a crossover temperature scale @xmath189 @xmath190 and the scaling",
    "is controlled by the electric field @xmath191 ( or equivalently , the applied current @xmath185 ) .",
    "one might be tempted to identify @xmath192 as the effective temperature of the electrons in the presence of the electric field , but this is not strictly appropriate since the system is assumed to have been driven out of equilibrium on length scales larger than @xmath177 .",
    "this quantum critical scaling picture explicitly assumes that the slow internal time scales of the system near its critical point control the response to the electric field and implicitly assumes that we can ignore the time scale which determines how fast the joule heat can be removed by phonon radiation .",
    "thus this picture is quite distinct from that of a simple heating scenario in which the electron gas itself equilibrates rapidly , but undergoes a rise in temperature if there is a bottleneck for the energy deposited by joule heating to be carried away by the phonons .",
    "this effect can give rise to an apparent non - linear response that is , in fact , the linear response of the electron gas at the higher temperature . the power radiated into phonons at low electron temperatures",
    "scales as @xmath193 where @xmath194 depending on details @xcite .",
    "equating this to the joule heating ( assuming a scale invariant conductivity ) yields an electronic temperature @xmath195 we now have a paradox .",
    "the more irrelevant phonons are at low temperatures ( i.e. , the larger @xmath58 is ) , the smaller is the exponent @xmath196 and hence _ the more singular is the temperature rise produced by the joule heat_. comparing eqs.([eq : t_0(e ) ] ) and ( [ eq : t_e(e ) ] ) we see that for @xmath197 we have @xmath198 that is , we then have that the temperature rise needed to radiate away sufficient power is larger than the characteristic energy ( ` temperature ' ) scale predicted by the quantum critical scaling picture . in this case the phonons are ` dangerously irrelevant ' and the simple quantum critical scaling prediction fails .",
    "it happens that for the case of gaas , which is piezoelectric , @xmath199 which gives the same singularity exponent as the quantum critical model @xmath200 ( since @xmath83 ) .",
    "hence both quantum critical and heating effects are important .",
    "( the phonon coupling is ` marginally dangerous ' . )",
    "this result is discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the final signatures of critical behavior which we wish to discuss are universal amplitudes , and , more generally , amplitude ratios .",
    "these are readily illustrated in the quantum hall problem without considering their general setting , for which we direct the reader to the literature @xcite . note that the scaling forms ( [ eq : rhoscaling ] ) and ( [ eq : iscaling ] ) imply that the resistivities at @xmath201 in the critical region are independent of @xmath202 and @xmath185 . under certain assumptions",
    "it is possible to argue that they are , in fact , universal @xcite .",
    "the observation of such universality between microscopically different samples would then be strong evidence for an underlying qpt as well .",

    "apart from the delicate issues surrounding the interpretation of the current scaling data mentioned earlier , there is one significant puzzle .",

    "the transitions to the insulator studied more recently , are believed to be much less sensitive to this problem , and hence the consistency of the data on those is encouraging .",

    "regrettably , there is at present no example of a quantum critical phase transition as clean as the remarkable case of the classical lambda transition in superfluid helium for which superb scaling can be demonstrated .",

    "this leads to an understanding of the @xmath104 behavior of the quantum system in terms of finite size scaling and to the identification of a @xmath68-dependent length scale , @xmath122 , that governs the crossover between quantum and classical fluctuations .",

    "<S> a quantum system can undergo a continuous phase transition at the absolute zero of temperature as some parameter entering its hamiltonian is varied . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions are particularly interesting for , in contrast to their classical finite temperature counterparts , their dynamic and static critical behaviors are intimately intertwined . </S>",
    "<S> we show that considerable insight is gained by considering the path integral description of the quantum statistical mechanics of such systems , which takes the form of the _ classical _ statistical mechanics of a system in which time appears as an extra dimension . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , this allows the deduction of scaling forms for the finite temperature behavior , which turns out to be described by the theory of finite size scaling . </S>",
    "<S> it also leads naturally to the notion of a temperature - dependent dephasing length that governs the crossover between quantum and classical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these ideas using josephson junction arrays and with a set of recent experiments on phase transitions in systems exhibiting the quantum hall effect .    a century subsequent to andrews s discovery of critical opalescence in carbon dioxide , continuous phase transitions continue to be a subject of great interest to physicists . </S>",
    "<S> the appeal of the subject is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , the list of systems that exhibit interesting phase transitions continues to expand ; it now includes the universe itself ! </S>",
    "<S> second , the formal theory of equilibrium phase transitions has found applications in problems as diverse as constructing field and string theories of elementary particles , the transition to chaos in dynamical systems , and the long time behavior of systems out of equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> our purpose in this colloquium is to give a brief and qualitative account of some basic features of a species of phase transitions , termed ` quantum phase transitions ' ( qpts ) , that have attracted much interest in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions take place at the absolute zero of temperature , where crossing the phase boundary means that the _ quantum ground state _ of the system changes in some fundamental way . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by changing not the temperature , but some parameter in the hamiltonian of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter might be the charging energy in josephson junction arrays ( which controls their superconductor - insulator transition ) , the magnetic field in a quantum hall sample ( which controls the transition between quantized hall plateaus ) , doping in the parent compound of a high t@xmath0 superconductor ( which destroys the antiferromagnetic spin order ) , or disorder in a conductor near its metal - insulator transition ( which determines the conductivity at zero temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> these and other qpts raise new and fascinating issues for theory and experiment , most notably the inescapable necessity of taking quantum effects into account .    </S>",
    "<S> exactly what quantum effects are at issue is a bit subtle . as a corollary of our definition , </S>",
    "<S> all finite temperature transitions are to be considered `` classical '' , even in highly quantum mechanical systems like superfluid helium or superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it is not that quantum mechanics is unimportant in these cases , for in its absence there would not _ be _ an ordered state , i.e. the superfluid or superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , sufficiently close to the critical point quantum _ fluctuations _ are important at the microscopic scale , but not at the longer length scales that control the critical behavior ; in the jargon of statistical mechanics , quantum mechanics is needed for the existence of an order parameter but it is classical thermal fluctuations that govern it at long wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , near the superfluid ` lambda ' transition in @xmath1he , the order parameter is a complex - valued field which is related to the underlying condensate wave function . </S>",
    "<S> however , its critical fluctuations can be captured exactly by doing _ </S>",
    "<S> classical _ statistical mechanics with an effective hamiltonian for the order parameter field ( for instance the phenomenological landau - ginsburg free energy functional @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind the classical nature of finite temperature transitions is the following : phase transitions are quite generally accompanied by a divergent correlation length and correlation time , i.e. the order parameter ( e.g. the magnetization in a ferromagnet ) fluctuates coherently over increasing distances and ever more slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the latter implies that there is a frequency @xmath2 associated with the critical fluctuations that vanishes at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum system behaves classically if the temperature exceeds all frequencies of interest , and since @xmath3 close to the transition , the critical fluctuations will behave classically .    </S>",
    "<S> this argument also shows that the case of qpts where @xmath4 , is qualitatively different and that there the critical fluctuations must be treated quantum mechanically . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will describe the language and physical pictures that enable such a treatment and which have come into common usage among practitioners in the field in the last few years . </S>",
    "<S> although much of this wisdom , which has its roots in work on quantum ising models @xcite , dates back to the work of hertz ( 1976 ) , it remains unknown or poorly understood in the wider community and extracting it from the literature remains a daunting task . </S>",
    "<S> it is our hope here to communicate this set of ideas to a wider audience with the particular desire to be helpful to newcomers to this field , experimentalists and theorists alike .    </S>",
    "<S> our discussion is organized as follows . in section  [ qsm ] </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the statistical mechanics of quantum systems and the path integral @xcite approach to it , which is an extremely useful source of intuition in these problems . a running theme throughout this discussion is the intertwining of dynamics and thermodynamics in quantum statistical mechanics . in section  [ pfpi ] </S>",
    "<S> we describe the general features of a qpt at @xmath5 and how a non - zero temperature alters the physics . </S>",
    "<S> this leads naturally to a discussion of what kind of scaling behavior in experiments is evidence of an underlying qpt in section  [ e1djja ] . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this using particular examples from phase transitions in quantum hall systems . </S>",
    "<S> we end in section iv with a brief summary and pointers to work on qpts in other interesting systems . </S>",
    "<S> readers interested in a highly informative discussion at a higher technical level should consult the recent beautiful review article by sachdev ( 1996 ) . </S>"
