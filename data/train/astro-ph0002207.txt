    "we study a sample of 43 grbs selected for the high - quality of their time - resolved spectra obtained with the batse spectroscopy detectors ( sensitive in the energy range @xmath0  kev ) .",
    "the time over which each spectrum was accumulated was varied so that the signal - to - noise ratio was greater than 15 ( in the hard x - ray energy band ) .",
    "these data provide excellent temporal resolution : in many cases we obtain more than 10 spectra per burst with accumulation times as short as 256 ms .",
    "we fitted each grb time - resolved spectrum with two models : ( 1 ) the band model [ 1 ] , and ( 2 ) the optically thin synchrotron shock model ( otssm ) @xcite . the ( purely phenomenological ) 4-parameter band model @xcite consists of two power - law components ( of spectral indexes @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) joined smoothly by an exponential roll - over near a break energy @xmath3 .",

    "we performed an independent spectral fitting for the band and otssm models for each of the time - resolved spectra of all grbs of our sample . for each grb",
    "we obtain 4 ( 3 ) best fit parameters as a function of time representing the complete spectral evolution .",
    "we find grb spectral evolutions of two types : ( 1 ) a  tracking behaviour \" , with spectral parameters in approximate one - to - one correspondence with the changing energy flux , and ( 2 ) a  hard - to - soft evolution \" , with spectral parameters evolving independently of the energy flux ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    fig.[gp-20-fig01 ] shows the distribution for _ all _ collected time - resolved spectra of the low - energy spectral index @xmath1 .",
    "a few bursts show values @xmath5 2/3 typically during the initial - rising part of their most intense pulses .",
    "the high energy spectral index @xmath2 is less constrained , and in some cases varies substantially over consecutive spectra within the same burst .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution ( fig.[gp-20-fig02 ]  left panel ) is peaked near 2 for the band model representation , and is broader for the otssm fits .",
    "break energies @xmath3 are typically well below 500 kev .",
    "interestingly , we find that the otssm provides a very good representation of time - resolved spectral data .",

    "we studied 43 grbs from the batse spectral archive selected by their large signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we collected information for a total of 1046 spectra .",
    "our results indicate that the otssm is quite successful in describing the majority of grb spectra .",
    "fig.[gp-20-fig03 ] shows the spectral evolution of the remarkable grb  990123 demonstrating the validity of the otssm for very intense bursts .",
