    "in the past two decades , and mainly thanks to nasa s _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , about @xmath0 x - ray binaries , believed to contain a black hole , have been analysed in detail @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of these objects is rapid x - ray variability @xcite , in which quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are included .",
    "of particular relevance are high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) , features observed in the power spectra of the light curves of black hole candidates , which are a potentially important tool in the study of strong gravitational fields .",
    "the frequencies observed , and their stability against luminosity variations , suggest a connection with the inner accretion flow @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite argued that these oscillations can be explained in terms of modes arising in the accretion disc that surrounds the black hole .",
    "turbulent viscosity , characteristic of accretion flows , generally prevents waves from propagating across the disc to form coherent global modes .",
    "a possible way for such modes to exist is for them to be trapped in a small region in the inner part of the disc .",
    "radial trapping of waves was first predicted by @xcite , who considered oscillations in a disc around a schwarzschild black hole , and was studied further by @xcite .",
    "although trapped waves may reveal relatively little about the properties of the accretion disc itself , they are a promising tool in the study of the central object . according to @xcite , a good model of hfqpos",
    "would provide the most reliable avenue for measuring black hole spins .",
    "once their masses are also determined , an important step in testing the kerr metric will be taken .    for trapped oscillations to explain hfqpos , an excitation mechanism for these modes",
    "is required , as their amplitudes need to reach values high enough to allow detection .",
    "a possibility can reside in the interaction between waves in the disc and a global deformation ( warping or eccentricity ) .",
    "@xcite initially studied the local excitation of waves in a tidally distorted disc via the parametric instability .",
    "the idea of using a warp as an excitation mechanism for disc oscillations goes back to @xcite , who mentioned the possibility of parametric generation of inertial waves .",
    "detailed calculations are reported by @xcite .",
    "more recently , and using a different approach , this problem was studied analytically for thin , relativistic discs with non - rotating central objects by @xcite ( see also @xcite , where similar calculations are made for eccentric discs ) .",
    "he made simple estimates for the growth rates of trapped inertial modes , which are of considerable interest .",
    "on the other hand , there are many uncertainties in his calculations and he did not discuss the origin or nature of the global deformations .    in this paper",
    "we develop and generalize kato s ideas on this excitation mechanism and make detailed numerical calculations of the modes and growth rates for rotating black holes .",
    "we include a dynamical treatment of the warp or eccentricity but defer to a second paper a broader discussion of the origin and global propagation of these deformations .",
    "in section 2 we review the trapping of inertial oscillations in a simple , pseudo - relativistic disc model . in section 3",
    "we describe the excitation mechanism for trapped inertial modes , which relies on a coupling between waves in the disc and global deformations . in section 4",
    "we discuss the dependence of the inertial modes growth rates on disc parameters and black hole spin .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the trapping of oscillations can be easily understood by analysing the fluid equations in a simple isothermal disc model @xcite .",
    "although this trapping happens only in discs around compact objects , a fully relativistic model is not necessary .",
    "the most important effects can be included by supplementing a newtonian treatment with the correct relativistic expressions for the characteristic frequencies in the disc @xcite . for simplicity and clarity",
    ", we adopt this pseudo - relativistic approach and consider a strictly isothermal disc with a ratio of specific heats @xmath1 . ignoring viscosity and magnetic fields , the fundamental hydrodynamic equations can be written as @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the enthalpy and @xmath5 is the constant sound speed in the disc .",
    "we neglect self - gravitation and consider a fixed axisymmetric gravitational potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are cylindrical polar coordinates .      as in the case of stars @xcite , to study oscillations one needs to analyse what happens to this system of equations when the velocity and enthalpy are perturbed : @xmath8 .",
    "the equilibrium state of the disc is independent of time and azimuth : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the angular velocity , which is independent of @xmath11 in a strictly isothermal disc , while @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 .",
    "thus the perturbations acting on it can be written as @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the azimuthal mode number and @xmath16 is the oscillation frequency .",
    "dropping , for simplification , the tildes and zeros , the linearized equations for the perturbed quantities can be written in the form @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the doppler - shifted wave frequency , which is zero at the corotation radius , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the epicyclic and vertical frequencies , respectively @xcite .",
    "we apply the thin disc approximation ( @xmath24 ) , and neglect the term @xmath25 in the last equation .",
    "the latter approximation is valid if the radial wavelength for perturbations is smaller than the radial scale on which the enthalpy varies in the basic state .",
    "variables can then be further separated in @xmath26 and @xmath11 , using @xcite    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the modified hermite polynomial of order @xmath30 @xcite , with @xmath31 being the vertical mode number and @xmath32 the vertical scaleheight of the disc .",
    "( since @xmath33 is not defined , for @xmath34 we have @xmath35 . )",
    "it should be noted that this separation of variables is not exact since @xmath36 depends on @xmath26 ( as described by @xcite , this separation is valid to lowest wkb order ; @xcite use a slowly varying function of @xmath26 to separate variables ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath36 with @xmath26 couples different vertical modes @xcite but this effect is weak when the radial wavelength is short , and we neglect it .",
    "the final set of ordinary differential equations in @xmath26 for the perturbed quantities reads    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40 . \\label{free2}\\ ] ]      the dispersion relation for wave modes in the disc can be determined by further assuming that the radial wavelength of the perturbed quantities is much smaller than both the azimuthal wavelength and the characteristic scale for radial variations of the equilibrium quantities .",
    "it can then be verified that perturbations with local radial wavenumber @xmath41 obey @xcite @xmath42 as argued before , the most important relativistic effects on wave propagation can be included by using relativistic expressions for the characteristic frequencies . for a particle orbit , these read @xcite , @xmath43",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dimensionless spin parameter of the central object ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath26 is in units of the gravitational radius @xmath48 and the frequencies are in units of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the speed of light , @xmath51 the gravitational constant and @xmath52 the mass of the black hole .",
    "we assume that the characteristic frequencies in the disc can be approximated by these particle orbit expressions .",
    "of great importance is the variation of the epicyclic frequency @xmath22 with @xmath26 : as @xmath26 decreases , @xmath22 increases , reaches a maximum and then goes to zero at the radius of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath53 , which can be regarded as the inner edge of the accretion disc . since we are interested in studying oscillations in accretion discs around compact objects , we adopt these relativistic expressions .",
    "they correctly describe the frequency and stability of orbits in the kerr metric , as well as the apsidal and nodal precession rates , but some information about the metric coefficients is lost in this pseudo - relativistic approach .    from the dispersion relation",
    "we can see that , if @xmath54 , two types of wave - like solutions , propagating in different regions in the disc , are possible : a high - frequency one with @xmath55 ( p  mode ) and a low - frequency one with @xmath56 ( r  mode ) .",
    "if @xmath34 the dispersion relation for the non - trivial mode becomes @xmath57 and waves can propagate where @xmath58 ; this is the inertial - acoustic mode . in non - isothermal discs",
    "the closest equivalent of this mode behaves like a surface gravity wave or stellar f  mode @xcite but here we refer to it as the @xmath34 mode or 2d mode , since it involves a purely horizontal motion independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the inertial or r  modes ( so called by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are nearly incompressible since they are restored by inertial forces , avoiding acoustic effects .",
    "( they are often called g  modes in the literature , but they are not related to internal gravity waves or stellar g  modes . )",
    "acoustic or p  modes have pressure as their main restoring force and are essentially compressible . in an isothermal disc ,",
    "the 2d mode is a purely horizontal compressible mode .",
    "the propagation regions of the p and r  modes allow us to define important radii in the disc , the resonant radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "non - axisymmetric waves can have three types of resonances : corotation where @xmath59 , lindblad resonances where @xmath60 , and vertical resonances where @xmath61 ( for @xmath62 ) .",
    "lindblad resonances are turning points for the r and 2d modes , while vertical resonances are turning points for p  modes .",
    "the three different types of modes propagate in different regions in the disc .",
    "if the epicyclic frequency has a maximum at some particular radius , r and 2d modes can be trapped in the inner part of the disc , while p  modes always propagate to the outer boundary beyond the outer vertical resonance .",
    "originally @xcite considered the trapping of 2d modes in the very inner region of the disc .",
    "these modes can be trapped between the radius of the marginally stable orbit and the inner lindblad resonance .",
    "however , the conditions at @xmath63 are not well understood and it is not clear if this trapping region can work as a resonant cavity .",
    "therefore , here we focus on the trapping of r  modes , which happens below the maximum of the epicyclic frequency between two lindblad resonances ( and with no corotation resonance in between ) , a resonant cavity naturally created by the non - monotonic variation of @xmath22 with radius @xcite .    of particular importance",
    "is the axisymmetric trapped wave with frequency @xmath64 , and with the simplest possible radial structure .",
    "this mode is trapped in a small region close to the maximum of the epicyclic frequency , and is important , not only because it is naturally confined and therefore more likely to occur in the presence of turbulent viscosity , but also because its frequency can be identified with @xmath65 , which depends only on the properties of the black hole : its mass @xmath52 and its angular momentum @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , this mode is likely to be most easily observed , as it may produce a net luminosity variation of the disc without cancellations .",
    "therefore , measuring the frequency of this mode and determining the mass of the central object by , e.g. , studying the orbit of its binary companion , one can , in principle , find the spin of the black hole .      to find the radial structure of trapped modes we need to solve the system of equations ( [ free1])([free2 ] ) , subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "numerical calculations of waves trapped near the maximum of the epicyclic frequency were first performed by @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the simplest possible trapped inertial modes , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "an approximate analysis of equations ( [ free1])([free2 ] ) close to the maximum of the epicyclic frequency shows that , between the two lindblad resonances , these solutions are described by parabolic cylinder functions @xcite involving hermite polynomials of order @xmath68 , centred at the maximum of @xmath22 , like the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite as the radial mode number . here",
    "the three quantum numbers are @xmath69 corresponding to the three coordinates @xmath7 . ] . the lowest order mode ( @xmath70 )",
    "has a gaussian structure in @xmath26 . in this section",
    "we solve the same problem using numerical methods and fewer approximations , as a prelude to an analysis of the non - linear mode couplings that cause these modes to grow .",
    "since we expect to find trapped modes only for some discrete values of the oscillation frequency , we solve the set of equations as a generalized eigenvalue problem , of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the column vector whose components are the r  mode quantities @xmath73 evaluated at a set of discrete points , @xmath74 is the matrix representing the system of equations ( [ free1])([free2 ] ) , and @xmath75 can be different from the identity matrix depending on the boundary conditions used .",
    "to solve this problem numerically , we use a pseudo - spectral method with chebyshev polynomials .",
    "we use a gauss  lobatto grid , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number of grid points , and the chebyshev coordinate @xmath78 is related to the radial coordinate by @xmath79 so that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is an outer radius chosen to be larger than the outer lindblad resonance for the r  mode .",
    "the representation of the first derivatives in the matrix @xmath74 is achieved using the chebyshev collocation derivative matrix , defined by @xcite @xmath83 & i = j , \\ , j\\neq0 , n \\\\ ( -1)^{i+j}p_i/[p_j(x_i - x_j ) ] & i\\neq j ,   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 otherwise .",
    "the generalized eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath74 are then calculated numerically , using idl s eigenvalue solver , la_igenproblem , which uses a qr decomposition , and is based on lapack routines .",
    "the boundary conditions used are the following :    * * at @xmath86*@xmath87 @xmath88 . according to the dispersion relation ,",
    "the r  mode is expected to be exponentially decaying for radii smaller than its innermost lindblad resonance and therefore its velocity is supposed to be approximately zero at the marginally stable orbit , which justifies the choice of this boundary condition . * * at @xmath89*@xmath87 @xmath90 , where @xmath41 is given by the dispersion relation ( [ disprelation ] ) for @xmath66 , @xmath67 at @xmath82 , and using @xmath64 .",
    "since the r  mode can propagate again as a p  mode outside the vertical resonance , we choose an outer radius beyond this location , so that the mode is oscillatory there , i.e. , @xmath41 is real , and we select the outgoing wave solution by choosing @xmath91 so that the group velocity of the waves at @xmath82 is positive .",
    "this condition allows the wave to lose energy through the outer boundary and minimizes artificial wave reflection there .",
    "we allow for the possibility that @xmath16 is complex , in which case its imaginary part is the growth rate of the disturbance .",
    "in fact , in the absence of non - linear mode couplings , we obtain slowly decaying solutions with @xmath92 as a result of the outgoing - wave outer boundary condition .    in fig .",
    "[ freermode ] we show the variation of @xmath93 with radius for two typical trapped solutions , corresponding to two different radial mode numbers @xmath70 and @xmath94 .",

    "also , as in quantum mechanics , these trapped inertial waves can escape through the potential barriers and propagate on the other side , as p  modes .",
    "the inertial modes are evanescent between the inner radius and the first lindblad resonance and between the second lindblad resonance and the vertical one .",

    "this ` leakage ' was first predicted by @xcite .",
    "as described above , the inertial mode characterized by @xmath103 is likely to be relevant to the interpretation of observed oscillations . in the next section",
    "we describe an excitation mechanism for this mode , based on non - linear wave coupling .",
    "if the modes are not strongly coupled , we expect the mechanism to affect mainly the growth rate @xmath104 , so that the structure of the wave still resembles a gaussian centred at the maximum of @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ freermode ] ( a ) .",
    "low - frequency modes with azimuthal mode number @xmath105 have been widely studied in the context of ( quasi-)keplerian accretion disc theory @xcite , since they are global , typically vary on length - scales comparable to the radial extent of the disc , and are long - lived .",
    "@xcite showed that these modes are also global in a relativistic disc . a global @xmath105 mode with one node in the vertical direction ( @xmath67 ) is typically identified with a warp in the disc @xcite , while @xmath34 modes correspond to eccentric discs .",
    "this is easily seen if we focus on the action of each of these modes on a ring .",
    "the vertical displacement of a @xmath106 mode is independent of @xmath11 , and proportional to @xmath107 at fixed @xmath26 and @xmath108 , which corresponds to a tilting , as the displacement _ with respect to _ the disc plane is different at each azimuthal angle . in the case of the @xmath34 mode ,",
    "the radial displacement is the one that is independent of @xmath11 , and proportional to @xmath107 at fixed @xmath26 and @xmath108 .",
    "this means that the displacement _ within _ the disc plane varies with @xmath109 , creating an elliptical orbit .",
    "as we discuss below , these global deformation modes can be produced by the presence of a binary companion or by instabilities .",
    "it is believed that warps exist in many astrophysical discs . precessing warped discs",
    "have been used successfully to explain long - term light - curve variations in her x-1 and some other x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "if the central object is a compact radiation source , warps can be induced by radiation pressure forces @xcite . however",
    ", this mechanism is less likely to operate in systems containing a black - hole primary because the disc needs to be very large @xcite .",
    "if the central object is a rotating black hole , its axis of rotation might not be perpendicular to the plane of the binary orbit in which the accretion disc forms , in which case the disc is said to be misaligned or tilted .",
    "there is both theoretical and observational evidence for this tilting ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the misalignment of the orbital angular momentum of the disc and the spin angular momentum of the black hole results in important changes in the structure of the inner disc as it will be subject to lense  thirring precession @xcite .",
    "this differential precession tends to twist the disc , which may adopt a stationary warped shape .",
    "depending on the ` amount of viscosity ' , the induced warps can propagate either diffusively , roughly speaking if the @xcite viscosity parameter @xmath110 is greater than @xmath111 , or in a wave - like manner if @xmath110 is smaller than @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite showed that the warp has an oscillatory radial structure in a low - viscosity disc , and this was investigated further by @xcite .      in a vertically isothermal ( pseudo-)relativistic disc , with @xmath1 , a zero - frequency mode with @xmath67",

    "[ warpg ] .",
    "the warp has an oscillatory behaviour , as found by @xcite , with the wavelength increasing with radius , consistent with the local dispersion relation .",

    "we defer to a second paper a more realistic treatment of the propagation of the warp into the inner part of the disc .     for @xmath97 .",

    "we are interested in those couplings that lead to amplification of the trapped modes .",
    "the basic idea of the excitation mechanism in warped discs @xcite is that the warp interacts with a wave in the disc ( the trapped r  mode ) giving rise to an intermediate mode .",
    "this intermediate mode can then couple with the warp to feed back on the original oscillations ( see fig . [ diagram ] ) , resulting in growth of the latter .    for the r  mode to be excited",
    ", it needs to gain energy in this coupling .",
    "since the warp has null frequency , its energy is essentially zero and so the energy exchanges only happen between the r and the intermediate modes and the disc .",
    "it is widely agreed , and certainly true in the short - wavelength limit , although a general proof is lacking , that a mode that propagates inside its corotation radius has negative energy , i.e. , the total energy of the disc is reduced in the presence of the wave , which is possible because the disc is rotating . on the other hand an axisymmetric wave , such as the r  mode , or one that propagates outside its corotation radius , has positive energy .",
    "suppose that , through coupling with the warp , the r  mode generates an intermediate wave that propagates inside its corotation radius and therefore has negative energy .",
    "in the process of generating this wave , the r  mode gains energy and is amplified . for sustained growth of the r  mode , the intermediate wave",
    "must be damped so that its negative energy is continually replenished by the r  mode .",
    "( the damping process itself draws positive energy from the rotation of the disc . ) therefore a dissipation term should be included in the equations for the intermediate mode .",
    "we choose to damp this wave locally at a rate @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the origin of this term is not discussed here but if we interpret it as some type of viscous dissipation or friction in the disc we expect the intermediate mode , which propagates in a larger region in the disc , to be more affected by it than the r  mode , as the latter is trapped in a small region , and has a simpler radial structure .",
    "also , the intermediate mode approaches its corotation radius ( or the marginally stable orbit ) , where it is expected to be absorbed , and this effect is implicitly included in the intermediate mode equations when the friction term is included .",
    "therefore , we neglect the dissipation term in the equations for the r  mode .",
    "the growth rate that we obtain for the trapped mode should be compared with estimates of its damping rate due to turbulent viscosity .        .",
    "[ diagram ]    for the coupling to occur the waves need to propagate in the same region in the disc and the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 for the 3 modes need to follow some basic coupling rules , @xmath144 where the subscripts r , w and i refer to r  mode , warp and intermediate mode quantities , respectively .",
    "these rules follow from the quadratic nature of the non - linearitites in the basic equations ( [ motion1 ] ) and ( [ energy1 ] ) .",
    "also , we can get information about the vertical mode number @xmath145 of the intermediate mode by remembering that the vertical dependence is given by hermite polynomials .",
    "the warp quantities are proportional to @xmath11 and the simplest possible r  mode has one node in the vertical direction , therefore its quantities are proportional to @xmath146 . when the warp and this r  mode interact , the coupling terms will be proportional to @xmath147 , i.e. , they give rise to two intermediate modes , one with 2 nodes in the vertical direction , @xmath148 , and a 2d mode with @xmath149 .",
    "we consider both possibilities .",
    "note that the frequency of these intermediate waves is that of the r  mode , and they are present because they are forced through the couplings .",

    "this mode propagates inside its corotation resonance , while the r  mode has positive energy .",
    "the presence of an inner lindblad resonance means both that the intermediate mode attains a larger amplitude than it would in the case of nonresonant forcing , and that the flow of energy is such as to amplify the r  mode .",

    "the propagation regions overlap close to the maximum of the epicyclic frequency since @xmath162 in this region .",
    "the interaction of the r  mode with the @xmath163 intermediate mode in a warped disc must be treated carefully because in this case the intermediate mode propagates between its lindblad resonances and is absorbed at the corotation resonance .",
    "this is a radius in the disc where the potential @xmath164 tends to infinity and is therefore difficult to treat numerically because the wavelength tends to zero .",
    "one way of solving this problem is by including a relatively strong dissipation term in the equations for the intermediate mode . in this way",
    "the wave excited at the inner lindblad resonance is damped before reaching corotation .",
    "this also works for the energy exchanges between the modes and the disc , since the @xmath163 mode has negative energy in the region where it is damped .          to find the r  mode growth rate resulting from these interaction we solve the systems of coupled equations ( [ fe1])([fe2 ] ) and ( [ int1])([int2 ] ) ( see appendix a ) for the interactions of the r  mode with the @xmath34 and @xmath163 intermediate mode respectively .",
    "by considering the warp to have a fixed amplitude and neglecting the feedback of the r  mode and intermediate modes on the warp , we still obtain a linear system of equations , although now the r  mode and intermediate modes are coupled through the warp .",

    "another possible mechanism for the excitation of trapped waves is their interaction with an eccentric disc @xcite .",
    "interacting binary stars with mass ratio @xmath173 are believed to have eccentric accretion discs .",
    "this phenomenon is well documented in the case of cataclysmic variable stars , where superhumps are observed during the superoutbursts of the su uma class of dwarf novae @xcite and in other systems of low mass ratio . in these systems , a resonant interaction of the orbiting gas with the tidal potential of the companion star allows a growth of eccentricity @xcite .",
    "superhumps are also observed in an increasing number of low - mass x - ray binaries , and systems exhibiting black - hole hfqpos are likely to have mass ratios @xmath173 and therefore to have eccentric discs during at least some phases of their outbursts .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that one - armed global oscillations , symmetric with respect to the @xmath174 plane , can excite trapped oscillations .",

    "the eccentricity has an oscillatory behaviour , with the wavelength decreasing with radius , consistent with the local dispersion relation .",

    "the latter then couples with the global mode to feedback on to the trapped r  mode .",
    "coupling rules require the intermediate mode to have the same frequency as the trapped wave and , as before , we have @xmath194 , in the case where the trapped r  mode is axisymmetric . as for the vertical dependence ,",
    "since the eccentric mode has @xmath34 , the intermediate mode can only have the same vertical mode number as the trapped mode , i.e. , @xmath195 .",
    "the propagation region for this mode is the same as for the @xmath158 intermediate mode , present in the interaction of the r  mode with the warp . as in that case ,",
    "a relatively large damping term must be included in the equations for the intermediate mode so that it dissipates on a resolved scale before reaching the corotation resonance . in this case",
    "the energy exchanges are similar to the ones discussed for the interaction in a warped disc .    to find the growth rates that result from this interaction , we solve equations ( [ inte1])([inte2 ] ) , using the same numerical method and boundary conditions as before .",
    "the variation of the growth rate with the inner eccentricity , sound speed , spin of black hole and dissipation factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ relecc ] .",
    "the values of the growth rate achieved in the interaction of the trapped wave with the eccentric mode are , in general , similar to the values obtained in the interaction with the warp , if the inner inclination and eccentricity are similar .",
    "in this section we discuss the results shown in figs [ relwarp ] and [ relecc ] , where the dependence of the @xmath70 r  mode growth rate with several parameters is represented .      in the variation of the growth rate with the dissipation factor ,",
    "two regimes can be considered : weak dissipation ( @xmath196 ) , where the variation is approximately linear , and strong dissipation ( @xmath197 ) , where the growth rate remains approximately constant when @xmath143 varies ( fig .",
    "[ relwarp ] ( a ) ) . in the former case ,",
    "the @xmath34 intermediate mode is launched at its inner lindblad resonance and propagates , being slightly attentuated , until it reaches the inner boundary where it is reflected .",
    "owing to the attenuation , the reflected wave amplitude is smaller than the incident one , and therefore the intermediate mode does not cancel itself , leaving a small amount of energy available for the r  mode to be excited . in the strong dissipation regime , the @xmath34 mode is dissipated before reaching the marginally stable orbit . in this case , all the energy carried by this wave becomes available to excite the trapped mode .",
    "as for the @xmath163 intermediate mode , in the strong dissipation regime , the wave is completely dissipated before reaching the corotation resonance .",
    "physically we would expect no dissipation term to be necessary in this case .",
    "an arbitrarily small amount of dissipation should lead in principle to the complete absorption of the wave at the corotation resonance .",
    "however , this can not be verified numerically because of the difficulty in resolving the wavelength of the intermediate mode as the singularity at the corotation resonance is approached .    for small warp amplitudes ,",
    "i.e. , before the coupling terms start affecting the structure of the eigenfunctions , the growth rate grows with the square of the warp amplitude at the inner boundary ( fig .",
    "[ relwarp ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this is expected since the coupling mechanism relies on the ` use ' of the warp twice : first on the interaction with the r  mode to give rise to the intermediate modes , and then again on the interaction with the latter to feed back on the former ( fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "the excitation mechanism discussed here is similar to the well known parametric instability , in the case where one of the modes is strongly damped .",
    "the parametric instability is a type of resonant coupling between three modes satisfying @xmath198 , where the subscripts p and d refer to parent and daughter modes , respectively .",
    "the parametric instability results in the transfer of energy from the former to the latter , when the daughter modes have small amplitude .",
    "the equations describing the evolution of the mode amplitudes read ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adapted from ) , @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the linear amplitude growth / damping rate of mode @xmath203 and @xmath204 is the non - linear coupling constant . let us consider a simplified case where the amplitude of the parent mode is approximately constant in time ( because the daughter modes are of small amplitude ) , and @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 . in this case , the parent mode can be compared to the warp while the daughter modes 1 and 2 can be compared with the r and intermediate modes , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath208 , the growth rate is @xmath209 if @xmath210 , @xmath211 , i.e. , the growth rate is linearly related to the amplitude of the parent mode . on the other hand , if @xmath212 , @xmath213 , i.e. , the growth rate is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the parent mode .",
    "the latter case is the one similar to the excitation mechanism we are discussing here .",
    "it should be noted that this parametric instability analysis gives a dependence of the growth rate in @xmath214 which is not in agreement with the numerical results ( considering @xmath214 to be equivalent to @xmath143 ) , because the dependence of the spatial structure of the intermediate mode on the dissipation is not considered in this simplistic analysis .",
    "also , the parametric instability analysis suggests that the daughter modes gain energy from the parent mode , which is not what happens in the coupling mechanism we are considering , since here the differential rotation of the disc , and not the warp , is the ultimate source of energy for the r  mode .",
    "although the parametric instability analysis gives a dependence of the growth rate on the disturbance amplitude in agreement with our numerical results , it is simplistic and does not consider all the details of the coupling mechanism .",
    "a parallel between the parametric instability and our excitation mechanism is therefore not straightforward .    in the strong dissipation regime , the intermediate mode dissipates completely , and does not influence the variation of the r  mode growth rate with both the sound speed of the disc and the spin of the black hole . in this regime ,",
    "the growth rate decreases with increasing @xmath5 , as expected . the hotter the disc is , the wider the modes get , which means that if the sound speed is high , the modes are not as well trapped . more importantly , the shape of the warp changes when the sound speed changes since its wavelength ( @xmath215 ) is proportional to @xmath216 .",
    "the interaction relies on the use of the warp twice , therefore we can argue that the growth rate is proportional to @xmath217 ( since @xmath126 represents the inclination and @xmath218 the actual warp ) . since @xmath219 , i.e. , for fixed sound speed the growth rate is proportional to the square of the inner warp amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ relwarp ] ( b ) ) and for fixed @xmath220 , the growth rate varies with @xmath221 ( fig .",
    "[ relwarp ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the small changes to the @xmath222 law are justified by the fact that , for large sound speed , the decay rate due to the ` leakage ' at @xmath223 is considerable .    as for the variation of the growth rate with the spin of the black hole",
    ", an important conclusion is that , in fact , as argued in the beginning of this section , there is no mode excitation if the black hole is non - rotating .",
    "this was not evident in kato s simple estimates for the growth rates .",
    "the fact that the growth rate increases with @xmath46 is also expected , not only because the waves are better confined for larger values of @xmath46 , but mainly because the average warp amplitude in the trapped region is larger , for larger @xmath46 . also , the wavelength of the warp decreases as @xmath46 increases , because the lense  thirring frequency ( @xmath224 ) increases .",
    "therefore , for the same inner @xmath126 , a larger @xmath218 is achieved . in light of these very preliminary results",
    ", we could argue that hfqpos would preferentially be detected in black hole candidates with large spin , if the interaction of the trapped r  mode with a warped disc is the mechanism responsible for the excitation of the former .      for the interaction between the r and intermediate modes in an eccentric disc , the variation of the growth rate with the dissipation factor",
    "is similar to the same variation for the interaction in a warped disc ( figs [ relecc ] ( a ) and [ relwarp ] ( a ) ) .",
    "also , the change of the growth rate with the inner eccentricity ( fig . [ relecc ] ( b ) ) is very similar to the variation of the growth rate with the warp tilt at the inner radius , i.e. , there is a square dependence on the eccentricity amplitude at @xmath166 .",
    "this is expected as the eccentric mode plays , in the wave interaction described in this section , the role of the warp in the interactions described previously .",
    "similarly , the variation with the sound speed ( fig . [ relecc ] ( c ) ) is also the expected one .    the main difference between the interaction with the warp and the interaction with the eccentric mode is in the variation of the growth rate with the spin of the black hole ( fig .",
    "[ relecc ] ( d ) ) .",
    "the warp , being a @xmath67 mode , has a variation with radius that strongly depends on the lense - thirring precession frequency , and therefore , that strongly depends on @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of the eccentricity amplitude with radius , given by equation ( [ eqe ] ) , is less dependent on the spin of the black hole .",
    "therefore , the variation of @xmath46 only causes variations of a factor of , at maximum , @xmath225 in the growth rate obtained for the interaction within the eccentric disc .",
    "a very important difference is the fact that , in this interaction , a reasonable growth rate can be obtained in the case where @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , in slowly rotating black holes , hfqpos might be detected if the disc is eccentric , and if this excitation mechanism is responsible for the increase in the amplitude of oscillations .",
    "in this paper we have described an excitation mechanism for trapped inertial modes , based on a non - linear coupling mechanism between these waves and global deformations ( warping or eccentricity ) in accretion discs .",
    "we have seen that the interaction of a trapped r  mode with an intermediate mode and a deformation in the disc results in growth of the trapped mode , if there is some process capable of making the intermediate mode dissipate in the disc .",
    "dissipation is required so that this mode can remove rotational kinetic energy from the disc , which becomes available for the r  mode to grow .",
    "depending on the values of the sound speed , spin of the black hole and amplitude of the deformation at the inner radius , reasonable growth rates can be obtained for a warp or eccentricity of modest amplitude . in a warped disc , where the growth rate varies significantly with the spin of the compact object , growth rates as large as @xmath226 , where @xmath16 is the oscillation frequency , can be obtained .",
    "if @xmath120 , no oscillations are excited in these discs .",
    "however , it may still possible to excite trapped modes in discs around non - rotating black holes if they are eccentric .",
    "the coupling process described here works as an excitation mechanism for trapped inertial waves , under a wide range of conditions , provided global deformations reach the inner disc region with non - negligible amplitude .",
    "the propagation of global modes , in a more realistic disc model , is the subject of a forthcoming paper @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we considered the excitation of trapped waves due to a non - linear coupling mechanism with global deformations , in a simple disc model . while this effect is responsible for the growth of these modes , it has to compete with others that contribute to the damping of these waves .",
    "for example , since the conditions at the marginally stable orbit are unknown , it is possible for a ` leakage ' of the trapped mode ( similar to the one considered in the potential barrier analogy ) through @xmath227 to exist .",
    "this effect is to be considered in the future .",
    "also , and more importantly , viscous dissipation in the disc can cause damping of these modes .",
    "a simple estimate gives a damping rate of @xmath228 .",
    "for small enough values of @xmath110 and large enough warp or eccentricity , net growth can occur .",
    "another point to be discussed is the applicability of our results to observed discs .",
    "we consider a very simple , isothermal disc model and wave perturbations for which @xmath1 . in a more realistic disc , the vertical structure of the waves",
    "is changed while they propagate radially .",
    "the wave energy concentrates either near the surface of the disc @xcite or towards the disc mid - plane @xcite , which could potentially hinder the propagation of intermediate modes away from the lindblad resonance where they are excited .",
    "however , the process of ` wave channelling ' mentioned by @xcite is only relevant at a distance from the resonance of @xmath229 ( @xmath230 being the radius of the lindblad resonance ) , where the radial wavelength becomes comparable to the semithickness of the disc .",
    "since the intermediate modes have @xmath105 , this effect is not important in the region where wave coupling occurs .",
    "the same is expected for cases in which the energy concentrates towards the disc mid - plane .",
    "the global deformation modes do not undergo significant wave channelling because their wavelengths are always long compared to @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we believe that our results , obtained in a simple disc model , are still qualitatively valid in more realistic discs .",
    "we thank john papaloizou for some helpful suggestions , in particular for pointing out the possibility of a relation between the coupling mechanism described here and the parametric instability .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for useful comments .",

    "also , since the simplest possible r  mode has one node in the vertical direction and the intermediate mode has @xmath34 , we use the following separation of variables :                this separation of variables results in having the coupling terms ( [ coup1 ] ) and ( [ coup2 ] ) proportional to @xmath249 only , while the coupling terms ( [ coup3])([coup4 ] ) give rise to terms proportional to both @xmath250 and @xmath251 . since we are interested in the terms that influence the mode with @xmath34 , we need to project these forcing terms on to @xmath252 . also , the separation of variables results in coupling terms of the form @xmath253 which means that the interaction of the @xmath66 r  mode with the @xmath105 warp results in two new modes , one with @xmath105 and one with @xmath254 : @xmath255 @xmath256 since we are only interested in the action of this coupling on the intermediate mode with @xmath105 , because the one with @xmath254 does not have any lindblad resonances ( location where the wave should be excited ) in the disc , these forcing terms are projected on to @xmath257 .",
    "similarly , the interaction of the intermediate mode with the warp gives rise to a @xmath258 mode in addition to the axisymmetric r  mode we are interested in :          after separating variables , and projecting the forcing terms appropriately , the equations to be solved can be written as @xmath262 @xmath263 @xmath264 @xmath265 @xmath266 @xmath267",
