    "in condensed matter physics , important information can be obtained about interactions in the electronic subsystem by analyzing relaxation processes associated with the scattering of conduction electrons by static disorder , by phonons , and by other electrons .",
    "one of the central questions regarding the relaxation processes is to explain temperature and retardation effects in simple physical terms by using simple enough self - consistent kinetic equations .",
    "the memory function is the common name for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-dependent relaxation function in such self - consistent kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "the relaxation rate is its imaginary part at zero frequency .",
    "the memory function is usually introduced to describe intraband relaxation processes in the dynamical conductivity tensor , in the raman response functions , as well as in different transport coefficients .",
    "it is well known that even in weakly interacting systems the explanation of experimental observations requires a unified diagrammatic representation for the so - called self - energy contributions to the response function in question and the related vertex corrections @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is easily seen that more complicated electronic system is longer is the list of requirements that the response functions and the relaxation functions in question must satisfy .",
    "the causality principle , the law of conservation of energy , and the charge continuity equation are all of fundamental importance in understanding the relaxation processes .",
    "consequently , they play an important role in analyzing measured transport coefficients and measured reflectivity and raman scattering spectra by means of such self - consistent kinetic equations .",
    "the _ stosszahl ansatz _ in boltzmann transport equations represents the simplest way to explain qualitatively the temperature dependence of the intraband relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "the part of the relaxation rate associated with the scattering by phonons is proportional to the bose - einstain distribution function and the @xmath2 term associated with corresponding quantum fluctuations of the lattice is missing . as a result ,",
    "the boltzmann transport equations have serious deficiencies in describing the retardation effects , in particular those associated with the scattering by optical phonons and by other high - energy boson modes .",
    "the generalized drude formula is the primary tool for investigating retardation effects .",
    "it is usually assumed to be a model independent method of analyzing measured reflectivity and raman scattering spectra in terms of the @xmath1-dependent memory function @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases of general interest the extraction of @xmath3 from experimental data depends on details in the boson mediated electron - electron interactions , on general properties of the crystal potential , as well as on the very nature of the local field effects .",
    "consequently , such an analysis is usually incomplete and often inadequate .",
    "therefore , to study the interband conductivity , or the excitations across the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) , spin - density - wave ( sdw ) or superconducting bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) gap or pseudogap , we need general enough self - consistent kinetic equations and much more sophisticated procedures for solving these equations than that usually used to derive the generalized drude formula .",
    "lightly doped graphene is an important weakly interacting two - band system in which the threshold energy for interband electron - hole excitations is of the order of optical phonon energies , the optical phonon energies are quite large , and the intraband and interband contributions to the dynamical conductivity tensor are expected to be decoupled from each other @xcite .",
    "the structure of the dynamical conductivity is similar to that of typical cdw / sdw pseudogaped systems , and , consequently , lightly doped graphene is a convenient model system for reexamining different open questions regarding electrodynamics of conduction electrons in such multiband electronic systems .    in this paper",
    ", we use the generalized self - consistent field method [ usually called the generalized random - phase approximation ( rpa ) ] to derive the memory - function conductivity formula for the intraband conductivity and to determine the structure of the intraband memory function in heavily doped and lightly doped graphene .",
    "the results are compared to both the results of the common variational method for the dc conductivity @xcite and to the results of a more accurate approach based on the quantum kinetic equation @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the scattering by phonons leads to the redistribution of the conductivity spectral weight over a wide energy range in a way consistent with the partial transverse conductivity sum rule .",
    "the intraband memory function has the same structure as that obtained by means of the quantum kinetic equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe all elements in the total hamiltonian for conduction electrons in a general multiband case . to make the reading of the paper easier ,",
    "we give in secs .",
    "iii and iv an overview of both the macroscopic identity relations among the exact elements of the real - time rpa irreducible @xmath4 response tensor and the microscopic version of the same identity relations . the partial effective mass theorem and the related transverse conductivity sum rule",
    "are shown to play an essential role in determining the proper structure of the memory - function conductivity formula .",
    "this transverse conductivity sum rule can also be useful in reexamining gauge invariance of the conductivity formula obtained by means of the common current - current approach @xcite or by different charge - charge approaches @xcite . in secs .",
    "iv and v , we discuss general properties of the generalized self - consistent rpa equations and the quantum transport equations .",
    "these two equations are used in sec .",
    "vi to derive the intraband memory - function conductivity formula and the leading contributions to the intraband memory function .",
    "the relation between the memory - function conductivity formula and the generalized drude conductivity formula is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "vii . in sec .",
    "viii , the numerical results for the real and imaginary parts of the intraband memory function are presented for heavily doped graphene for typical values of the model parameters . in sec .",
    "ix , we consider the two - band conductivity in lightly doped graphene . in this section , the emphasis is on the appropriate parametrization of the low - energy intraband conductivity tensor and on the connection between the effective generalized drude formula obtained in this way and the aforementioned partial transverse conductivity sum rule .",
