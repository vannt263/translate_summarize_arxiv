    "quiescent initial conditions were developed so that we were able to observe the accretion for a long time @xcite .",
    "these simulations have shown that many predictions of the theories developed in the 1970 s ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) are correct .",
    "namely , we observed that ( 1 ) the accreting matter is stopped by the magnetosphere at the magnetospheric radius @xmath2 , where the ram pressure @xmath3 equals to magnetic pressure @xmath4 , and is then lifted up and accretes to the star through funnel flows ;   ( 2 ) the magnetosphere influences the structure of the disk to a distance @xmath5 ; ( 3 ) a star may spin - up , spin - down , or may be in the _ rotational equilibrium state _ depending on the ratio between magnetospheric radius @xmath2 and corotation radius @xmath6 , as predicted by ghosh and lamb @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we searched for the rotational equilibrium state and investigated this state in detail @xcite .",
    "namely , we fixed the parameters of the disk and magnetic moment of the star , and changed the angular velocity of the star , @xmath7 .",
    "we found angular velocity @xmath8 at which the angular momentum flux to the star is zero on an average .",
    "figure [ fluxes ] shows the variation of fluxes at the surface of the star for the run with @xmath9 : the matter flux @xmath10 and the angular momentum fluxes @xmath11 and @xmath0 associated with the matter and the magnetic field respectively . the flux @xmath0 ( which always dominates over @xmath11 ) varies but is approximately zero on an average . we found that in the rotational equilibrium state @xmath12 .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of matter flow in the rotational equilibrium state .",
    "we see that matter accretes to the star through a funnel flow , and that some field lines are closed and others are inflated or radially stretched by the accreting matter .",
    "part of the magnetosphere , however , is always closed or only partially open , and this interaction is important for the spin - up / spin - down of the star .",
    "the fluxes in figure 1 vary with time because of inflation and reconnection events in the magnetosphere .",
    "we observed that in the rotational equilibrium state the rotation of the star is locked at some value @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is angular velocity of the disk at the magnetospheric radius .",
    "the number @xmath16 is smaller ( larger ) at smaller ( larger ) magnetic moments of the star @xmath17 .",
    "these two frequencies , @xmath18 and @xmath19 may represent two fundamental frequencies in each binary system in the equilibrium state .",
    "figure 3 ( left panel ) shows that for our typical case , shown in figure 2 , this ratio @xmath20 ( see figure 3 , left panel ) .",
    "this ratio is reminiscent of the typical ratio between the frequencies of the khz qpos observed from many lmxbs @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the surface of the star may be  marked \" by hot spots associated with accretion or thermonuclear burning at the surface of the star , while the inner disk radius , which is approximately equal to magnetospheric radius @xmath2 , may be marked by enhanced density in the disk or with enhanced reconnection at the boundary between magnetosphere and the disk .",
    "matter often accumulates and forms a larger density peak or , ring , at the radius @xmath21 , thus giving a  mark \" to this region .",
    "however , in some cases , the density peak is located at larger distances , as is shown in figure 3 ( right panel ) .",
    "the position of this peak varies with the accretion rate .",
    "it is closer to @xmath2 during periods of enhanced accretion . in case of accretion to a misaligned dipole the ring typically breaks into two spiral arms ( see next section ) which rotate with the frequency of the inner regions of the disk .",
    "( left panel ) , but forms the funnel streams at @xmath22 ( right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath23 case is shown.,width=491 ]",
    "we performed full three - dimensional simulations of the disk - magnetosphere interaction @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , for aligned angular momenta of the star and the disk , and for different misalignment angles @xmath24 between the magnetic and rotational axes .",
    "we observed that many features of the interaction are similar to those in the axisymmetric case .",
    "however , in the 3d case , many new features appear which are connected with the non - axisymmetry of the flow and which are important for analysis of high - frequency qpos .",
    "simulations have shown that matter typically accretes in two streams . in cases of relatively high - temperature of the disk @xcite or non - stationary accretion",
    ", more than two streams may form .",
    "the shape of the magnetospheric flow strongly depends on the density . in the same simulation",
    "run we see that the largest density matter flows in narrow streams , while the lower density matter may blanket the magnetosphere completely ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "so variability may be related to radiation / obscuration by the magnetospheric streams .",
    "the frequency of this quasi - periodic variability will be between @xmath25 and the frequency of the inner region of the disk , @xmath26 , which is higher than @xmath27 in the rotational equilibrium state ( see section 1 ) , but may be lower in some other cases . if two or several funnel streams form , then the frequency will be twice or several times higher than that expected in case of one stream .    .",
    "inner regions of the disk form a trailing spiral structure.,width=340 ]    other features which may lead to quasi - periodic oscillations are non - axisymmetric features observed in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "matter typically forms two - armed spiral waves which may contribute to quasi - periodic variability ( see example in figure 5 ) .",
    "the frequency associated with these features is @xmath28 .",
    "we should note that in case of the dipole field there are always two features , from opposite sides of the accretion disk , so that the frequency is twice as the frequency of the disk .",
    "in the relativistic case ( from @xcite).,width=491 ]     and inclination angles @xmath29 ( from @xcite).,width=491 ]    significant variability and quasi - periodic variability may be associated with the _ spots _ at the surface of the star .",
    "the shape of the spots , and also distributions of density , velocity , matter and energy fluxes , reflect those in the funnel streams : at small misalignment angles @xmath30 , the spots have the shape of a bow , while at large misalignment angles @xmath31 , they have the shape of an elongated bar @xcite,@xcite ( see also figure 6 ) .",
    "it is a common belief that the hot spots have fixed positions at the surface of the star .",
    "simulations have shown that the positions of the spots vary with time .",
    "if the disk is relatively cold , or the misalignment angle is large ( @xmath32 ) , then the spots change their shape and position only slightly , so that their frequency slightly varies around stellar frequency @xmath33 . however ,",
    "if the disk is relatively hot and the misalignment angle is small ( @xmath34 ) , then the funnel streams and spots may rotate faster or slower than the star , because one of foot - points is dragged by the disk , which may rotate faster or slower than the star .",
    "this may lead to significant departure of the associated frequency @xmath35 from the @xmath27 .",
    "the expected frequency @xmath36 is in between @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "temporary events of precession of the funnel streams ( and spots ) are expected in periods of non - stationary accretion .",
    "the light curves from the hot spots are different for different misalignment angles @xmath24 and inclination angles @xmath29 . to investigate these dependencies , we fixed hot spots at the surface of the star at some moment corresponding to quasi - equilibrium , and then investigated light curves for different @xmath24 and @xmath29 assuming that all kinetic energy of the flow is converted to black - body radiation @xcite .",
    "we observed that the amplitude of variability may be quite large and either one or two peaks can be observed depending on @xmath24 and @xmath29 .",
    "typically , two peaks are observed at larger @xmath24 and @xmath29 . however , in accretion to neutron stars , general relativistic , doppler , and other effects are important ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "typically , the gr effect dominates unless the star rotates extremely fast .",
    "we performed 3d simulations taking into account gr effects ( approximated by the paczyski - wiita potential ) and other effects for neutron stars with parameters close to those in millisecond pulsars .",
    "we observed that the shapes of the spots are very similar to those in the non - relativistic case @xcite ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we also observed that light bending effects strongly decrease the amplitude of the variability curves @xcite ( see figure 7 ) , agreeing with earlier predictions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in extreme cases , like @xmath37 and @xmath38 , both spots are observed at the same time , so that the amplitude of variability becomes very small ( figure 7 , right panel ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these two main features associated with ( 1 ) spots at the star and ( 2 ) spirals at the inner radius of the disk may lead to high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "simulations have shown that in case of the dipole magnetic field there will be _ two symmetric features _ ( two spirals and two hot spots ) and this will double the frequency .",
    "we should note that there is another important frequency , a beat frequency : @xmath39 which is taken into account in the beat - frequency and related models ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this frequency will correspond to the lower frequency oscillations .",
    "if magnetic field of the star is dynamically unimportant then the sonic - point model may be applicable for analysis of qpos ( @xcite ) .",
    "however we did not model cases with such a weak magnetic field .",
    "simulations often show variability of fluxes at much longer time - scales ( see , e.g. , figure 1 ) .",
    "this variability is connected with restructuring of the external magnetic field lines in the corona as a result of the disk - magnetosphere interaction .",
    "such variability appears at different rotation rates of the star , but it is the strongest at the  propeller \" regime of evolution .",
    "we studied disk accretion to a star in the propeller regime by axisymmetric mhd simulations . in the propeller regime",
    "the centrifugal force at the external boundary of the rotating magnetosphere is larger than the gravitational force , so that accreting matter has a tendency to be flung away ( e.g. , @xcite ",
    "we observed that there are two qualitatively different regimes :  weak \" propeller regime ( no outflows ) or `` strong '' propeller regime ( with outflows ) . in both cases",
    "the star strongly spins - down due to the interaction of the magnetosphere with the inner regions of the disk .",
    "the weak propeller occurs when the transport coefficients in the disk ( viscosity and diffusivity ) are relatively small .",
    "both viscosity and diffusivity were incorporated to the code and were considered in the simplified @xmath40 approach @xcite .",
    "the weak propeller realizes at relatively small transport coefficients , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we observed that magnetic field lines inflate , forming a magnetic tower ( see also @xcite ) , that the closed magnetosphere expands in the radial direction , and matter accumulates near the magnetosphere and is blocked by the inflated magnetic flux from accretion . at some point , the accreting matter moves forward , forces magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere to reconnect and accretes to the star .",
    "later , the magnetosphere expands again and the process repeats @xcite ( figure 8) .",
    "such quasi - periodic accretion events have lower frequencies @xmath43 at larger magnetic moments @xmath17 of the star and larger @xmath7 .",
    "the typical frequency of the oscillations lies in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 depending on parameters of the star and the disk .    the strong propeller ( with outflows )",
    "was obtained when the viscosity and diffusivity in the disk were larger , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we observed that matter is ejected in the form of conical , wide - angle jets as a result of magneto - centrifugal forces @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the process is quasi - periodic and we observed many periods of accretion and outflows .",
    "an example of outflows is shown in figure 9 .",
    "important factors which led to propeller - driven outflows are the larger viscosity and diffusivity in the disk , which helped to transport momentum from the magnetosphere to the disk . also , the enhanced viscosity helped the disk matter penetrate deeper into the rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the propeller . both accretion and",
    "outflows occur quasi - periodically , which is connected with periods of ( 1 ) inward viscous accretion ; ( 2 ) matter diffusion through the outer regions of magnetosphere and angular momentum transport from the magnetosphere to the disk ; ( 3 ) accretion to the star and outburst to the jet ; ( 4 ) outward motion of the disk ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the span of frequencies of quasi - periodic oscillations is similar to that in the weak propeller case , @xmath48 .",
    "figure 10 shows an example of the quasi - variable matter fluxes with a dominant low oscillation frequency @xmath49 .",
    "we also noticed that at even higher viscosity , @xmath50 , the quasi - periodic oscillations became very ordered ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "their frequency was observed to drift slowly from @xmath51 at the beginning of the simulation to @xmath52 at the end of the simulation after @xmath53 rotations of the star , because the disk moved closer to the star .",
    "similar oscillations were observed in a test run with even higher viscosity @xcite .",
    "we should note that the low - frequency variability is also observed in case of slowly rotating stars as a result of the restructuring of the magnetic field lines threading the inner regions of the disk ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "analysis of the disk - magnetosphere interaction in axisymmetric and full 3d mhd simulations have shown that : ( 1 ) in the rotational equilibrium state , the ratio between frequencies of the inner disk and of the star is @xmath54 for magnetospheric radii @xmath55 .",
    "this ratio may possibly be larger for larger @xmath2 ; ( 2 ) non - axisymmetric features in the inner regions of the disk ( typically , two - armed spirals , non - axisymmetry of the central density ring may lead to qpo oscillations with @xmath56 ; ( 3 ) at small misalignment angles @xmath24 the funnels may precess , and thus may rotate faster / slower than the star ; the frequency will vary between @xmath27 and @xmath26 or twice these values ( depending on the number of spots ) ; precession of funnels is expected during periods of non - stationary accretion ; ( 4 ) in all cases the hot spots slightly change their position and shape which may lead to low - amplitude qpos with frequency @xmath57 ; ( 5 ) low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations were observed at the  propeller \" stage , with dominant frequency in the range @xmath58 .        *",
