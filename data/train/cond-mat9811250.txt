    "the doped manganites r@xmath3s@xmath4mno@xmath2 ( where r is typically la and s is typically sr or ca ) have a fascinating ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) ( temperature , concentration ) phase diagram , including `` colossal magnetoresistance '' @xcite when @xmath7k and @xmath80.20 .",

    "there is disagreement over the relative role of coulomb , magnetic , and electron - phonon effects .",
    "we offer a simple unified picture in which the relevant energy scales in descending order are : ( 1 ) coulomb interactions are inactive after establishing the dominant hubbard and hund energy scales ; ( 2 ) electron - phonon interactions drive orbital ordering by the jt mechanism ; ( 3 ) when doped , electron - phonon interactions _ via _ orbital ordering give small anti - jt polarons ; and finally ( 4 ) orbital ordering disrupted by polarons is responsible for the unusual magnetic phases ( described in sec . iii . )    a canonical `` jahn - teller polaron '' @xcite is the excess electron in batio@xmath2 @xcite , which sits in a triply degenerate @xmath11 level . a local distortion of the lattice splits the degenerate levels . beyond a critical coupling strength ,",
    "this lowers the energy and traps the electron in a small polaron state .",
    "by contrast , the polarons in lamno@xmath2 are `` anti - jt polarons . '' when pure , the valence is mn@xmath1 , with @xmath12 configuration in the high - spin state @xmath13 with the doubly - degenerate @xmath0 level singly occupied . below the jt structural transition at @xmath14=750k @xcite , oxygen octahedra distort as illustrated schematically in fig . [ jt ] , lifting the @xmath0 degeneracy and lowering the energy of the occupied orbitals .",
    "when a hole is added , we show that a small polaron is formed by locally `` undoing '' @xcite the jt distortion , pinning the hole onto a mn@xmath15 site with a filled @xmath11 shell .",
    "the hamiltonian we use is @xmath16 .",

    "the source of the ferromagnetic in - plane exchange ( @xmath79=3.32 mev @xcite ) is orbital order which favors virtual hops from filled a sublattice @xmath44 orbitals to empty b sublattice @xmath44 with spin parallel to avoid a hund penalty .",
    "when orbitals are not ordered , the hund penalty is outweighed by the greater multiplicity of hops which @xmath11-electrons can make onto empty @xmath11-states on antiparallel neighbors .",

    "again , we simply adopt this order , without specifying the additional term in the hamiltonian .    in the opposite limit @xmath60 small , hopping energy is dominant , and the results depend on the magnetic order .",

    "the three largest errors in the calculation of the hole energy are ( 1 ) the localized hole can spread somewhat onto neighboring mn atoms ; ( 2 ) the hilbert space for both localized and delocalized hole wavefunctions should include states with orbital defects ( sites occupied singly , but by the orbital of wrong orientation ) ; ( 3 ) a hole in afa phase will lower its energy further by causing spin canting on mn atoms in adjacent planes , thus permitting interplanar hopping , and eventually driving an afa to ferro transition .",
