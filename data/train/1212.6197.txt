    "studying gauge field theories in low - dimensional space - time allowed for investigations both perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of quantum field theory . among abelian models of this kind the particular mention deserve quantum electrodynamics in two dimensions  the so called schwinger model ( sm )  @xcite )  and in three dimensions .",
    "the former , due to its full solvability , at least in the massless case , has become particularly fruitful and many nonperturbative effects have been discovered and analyzed .",
    "on can mention here the generation of the gauge boson mass , via the so called _ schwinger mechanism _ , fermion confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , the presence of instantons and the @xmath0-vacuum ( see for instance  @xcite ) , bound state formation  @xcite but also the status of the perturbation series  @xcite . due to these nontrivial features schwinger model has become a testing laboratory for various aspects of the theory of strong interactions .",
    "the massive version of this model in no longer solvable but is still attractive thanks to its relative simplicity and remarkable physical content  @xcite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions - the so called planar qed  plays an important role in understanding some aspects of qft too .",
    "one can recall here confinement  @xcite , chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , bound states  @xcite and the analysis of the gauge dependence of the nonperturbative results with various approximations  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the sm , the photon becomes in qed@xmath1 a dynamic particle and corresponds to real degree of freedom , although it has some peculiar features connected with the fact that the magnetic field is now a ( pseudo ) scalar and electric one a two - component vector restricted by the gauss law .",
    "the number of dimensions attributes to this model also other specific features .",
    "the model may be formulated in two inequivalent versions : the fundamental fermion field may be chosen as four- or two - component one . in the latter",
    " which we concentrate on in the present work  the most interesting is the appearance of the topological photon mass term  @xcite .",
    "this term may be , just in three dimensions , added to the standard lagrangian from the very beginning , since it exhibits both lorentz and gauge ( up to the surface terms ) invariance  such a theory is called chern - simons qed@xmath1  but even if absent , it is generated by the interactions with fermions .    both low - dimensional models find their applications also beyond qft : for instance in condense matter physics  @xcite .",
    "many of the above mentioned phenomena , as confinement , bound states or topological aspects , require for their study nonperturbative language .",
    "the problems with perturbation calculations in qed@xmath1 manifest themselves also through ambiguity in proper regularization  @xcite .",
    "the set of dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations  which , as one believes , contains the whole information about the quantum system  constitutes the main tool in nonperturbative investigations of qft .",
    "the common problem in this approach is , that these equations form an infinite hierarchy , the solution of which seems a hopeless task . to deal with this set one",
    "is forced to truncate this hierarchy at some level . in two dimensions ( in sm ) ,",
    "thanks to two gauge symmetries of the theory , it turned out to be possible to express the three - point ( vertex ) function by fermion propagator ( i.e. two - point function ) and obtain the close equation for the latter .",
    "not a whole hierarchy , but just one equation , which turned out to be easily solvable  @xcite .",
    "similar method , but now applied to higher functions ( five - point ) , allowed to write a self - consistent equation for two - fermion green s function  @xcite .    in greater number of dimensions ,",
    "i.e. in qed@xmath1 and qed@xmath2 , gauge symmetry is , however , not sufficient to fully express fermion - photon vertex function by lower ones and therefore we are obliged to assume a certain ansatz for @xmath3 .",
    "gauge covariance constitutes here a hint but does not solve the whole problem of truncating the hierarchy .",
    "various such anstze have been proposed based on kinematic properties , renormalizability and requirement of satisfying the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "one can mention in this context the ball - chiu  @xcite , burden - roberts  @xcite and curtis - pennington  @xcite vertices with further improvements  @xcite . in the present work , however , we pay particular attention to the vertex introduced by salam  @xcite and applied afterwards in the , so called , gauge technique  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using salam s ansatz in the form  ( [ eq : verp ] ) , apart from its elegance , is that feynman integrations in ds equations , are similar to those of perturbation calculations for which the computational technique is well elaborated .",
    "the main idea of the present work is similar to that of our previous paper  @xcite on qed@xmath2 , where it was successfully applied and the correct infrared form of propagators was established without the need of infinite renormalization . here",
    "again we assume the possible infrared behavior of propagators up to a set of certain unknown constants and try to determine these constants from the requirement of self - consistency .",
    "one has to emphasize that in this approach loop integrations are performed with infrared forms of the green s functions as integrands .",
    "since we do not wish to extend the results beyond the infrared domain , this procedure is fully acceptable .",
    "firstly we have to note that right hand sides of ds equations  ( [ eq : dysph ] ) and  ( [ eq : dyse ] ) have the form of convolutions , so the infrared behavior of the integrals should be dictated by the infrared behavior of integrands , secondly our method should not be worse than ordinary perturbation calculations , where _ free _ functions are used as integrands .",
    "finally one has to stress , that salam s ansatz  ( [ eq : verp ] ) in the infrared domain becomes exact .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : bdi ]",
    "we collect the main definitions and properties of the model . in section  [ sec : assump ] we formulate the assumptions as to the infrared behavior of the photon propagator , fermion propagator and fermion - photon vertex .",
    "the following two sections are devoted to obtaining , from the ds equations , the set of four nonlinear equations for four parameters : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the last section we present the numerical results and the dependence of all the parameters on the strength of the interaction .",
    "we find also the analytical results for the case of weak coupling .",
    "below we briefly summarize conventions used in this work and specify basic properties of dirac gamma matrices in three dimensions . as to the set of matrices @xmath8 we use the two - dimensional , i.e. spinor representation in which all gamma s may be expressed by pauli matrices in the following way : @xmath9 and matrix @xmath10 does not exist . due to this nonexistence",
    "the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking can be investigated only in four - dimensional representation , unless we introduce even number of flavors in the model .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath11 and the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath12 are defined as follows : @xmath13 with all other nonzero elements of the latter obtained by cyclic permutations .    in three dimensions",

    "sec : dsf ] we will also make use of other identities , which can be easily derived : @xmath16    lagrangian density of three - dimensional electrodynamics with gauge fixing term has the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gauge parameter .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the _ bare _ fermion mass and the _ bare _ coupling constant ( charge ) respectively and the former may eventually be put equal to zero leading to the parity invariant theory ( at least on the classical level ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that coupling constant has a dimension of @xmath21 and , as a result , the quantum theory is superrenormalizable .",
    "the strength tensor @xmath22 has only three independent elements , two of which ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) constitute to two - component vector of electric field , and one ( @xmath25 ) pseudoscalar magnetic field .",
    "it is well known  @xcite , that in three space - time dimensions to this lagrangian density may be added the so called chern - simons ( cs ) term , proportional to @xmath26 . although it is not invariant under gauge transformations , its change reduces to a total derivative inessential for physical observables . due to this term",
    "the photon field acquires a nonzero mass . in this work , however , we do not include explicitly cs term into the lagrangian and the photon mass will be generated dynamically .",
    "underneath the low momenta forms of the dressed two - point green s functions and three - point vertex are given .",
    "they reflect their analytic structures suggested by the perturbation calculation .      for the free propagator of massless vector particle we have the usual formula : @xmath27 it",
    "is well known from the perturbative approach  @xcite , that in three space - time dimensions , , photon  field acquires a ( topological ) mass , due to the vacuum polarization process .",
    "even if cs term is initially absent in the lagrangian , it is generated through the interaction with fermion loop . in the first approximation",
    "we can then assume for the dressed propagator @xmath28 where @xmath5 is the photon mass to be determined from the consistency conditions , with the renormalization constant @xmath7 present only in the transverse part of @xmath29 .",
    "this is a known fact by virtue of the gauge invariance and the ward - takahashi identity : @xmath30 which ascertains that only transverse part is modified by the interactions .    by the reason of unitarity we expect the nonperturbative value of @xmath7 to satisfy the condition",
    "@xmath31  @xcite . in our work on qed@xmath2 we obtained this value to be equal to @xmath32",
    "@xcite . as we will see in section  [ sec : rec ] , the above bounds will also be satisfied in the present work .",
    "we treat the denominator @xmath33 in  ( [ eq : dpr ] ) as the first term in its taylor expansion around @xmath34 and potentially admit also higher order polynomial in @xmath35 .",
    "the inverse of @xmath36 is @xmath37-\\lambda k^\\mu k^\\nu\\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the free fermion propagator has the standard form : @xmath38 with a pole in the bare mass @xmath19 .",
    "contrary to that , the perturbative calculations  @xcite ( at least in certain gauges ) show that , even if initially massless , , photon  acquires a mass @xmath5 , the , , dressed ",
    "fermion propagator should have , as a result of infrared divergences , a branch point at @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a physical mass .",
    "therefore we assume for further calculations the following form : @xmath41 with exponent @xmath4 to be determined ( together with mass renormalization constant @xmath42 ) by the later requirement of consistency .",
    "the additional power @xmath43 of @xmath44 in denominator improves the high momentum behavior of loop integrals ( after the analytical continuation of  ( [ eq : spr ] ) ) , making thereby the theory free of any ultraviolet divergences .    to get the spectral representation of  ( [ eq : spr ] ) , which will be needed for the construction of the vertex",
    ", we apply the cauchy integral formula for the function @xmath45 choosing the contour as shown in figure  [ fig : contour ] deformed to sandwich both cuts on the real axis .",
    "this is possible for @xmath46 , since otherwise the integrals over the small circles around branch points at @xmath47 diverge .",

    ". eventual inclusion of this constant ( i.e. an additional unknown variable ) would require to generate more equations by adjusting higher green s functions .",
    "this complicates our method , but we keep it in mind and leave for the next paper as a possible following step",
    ".    the problem with properly defining constant @xmath56 raised in  @xcite does not arise in our approach since we do not require the full fermion propagator to have a pole at mass @xmath40 . on the contrary we know , that such a pole does not exist in  ( [ eq : spr ] ) due to the infrared divergences and",
    "only the additional coefficient in numerator come into play .",
    "its value would be fixed by self - consistency and not by normalization requirement of the residue .",

    "please note , that @xmath107 ( for small @xmath104 ) and @xmath108 and it decreases with increasing coupling .",
    "the comparison of all numerical results suggests that it might be possible to find analytical solutions in the case of weak coupling ( which corresponds to heavy fermion ) , i.e. when @xmath109 . from the figure  [ fig : graph1 ]",
    "we conclude that in such a case we should assume @xmath110 .",
    "we suppose also that @xmath111 .",
    "all these assumptions will be justified _ a posteriori _",
    ", when the whole set of parameters is determined .    for small values of @xmath5 the equation  ( [ eq : jedeq ] ) may be given the approximate form ( considering gauges , where @xmath112 is of order of unity ) @xmath113 since all other terms , particularly those containing a quotient @xmath101 are small compared to @xmath114 and have been neglected .",
    "consequently we have @xmath115 which is in agreement with the assumption @xmath111 .    for small values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 the equation  ( [ eq : taueq ] ) reduces to ( recall that @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) @xmath118 which is the coleman s and hill s result  @xcite .",
    "the first plot of figure  [ fig : graph1 ] shows , however , that for larger values of @xmath104 it deviates form the straight line .",
    "this is well understood since in coleman s and hill s paper the value of the photon mass was defined as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a polarization scalar . in our work",
    "the position of the photon mass is determined by the equation @xmath121 .",
    "one should also keep in mind that our solution is only approximate .    from  ( [ eq : taus ] ) we find again that the assumption @xmath110 is justified . in a similar manner",
    "we get the following result for @xmath7 : @xmath122 and for @xmath6 : @xmath123 the unpleasant feature is the gauge dependence of the mass renormalization , which might indicate the similar gauge dependence of the physical fermion mass .",
    "it is , however , a common feature of perturbative and nonperturbative results in qed@xmath1  @xcite .    in the weak coupling regime one can obtain also the analytical results for the landau gauge , which corresponds to taking the limit @xmath124 .",
    "as is known , in this case the infrared singularities disappear  @xcite so we expect @xmath125 , since the fermion propagator should have an ordinary pole at physical mass and not a branch point . therefore , before taking the limit , we put @xmath126 with constant @xmath127 to be determined . with all other assumptions identical as above",
    ", we get similar results as before : @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 and hence for @xmath109 @xmath131 the result for the mass renormalization in this case is @xmath132    the nonanalyticity in @xmath104 observed in the last formula and in  ( [ eq : dms ] ) , which manifests itself through the presence of a logarithmic function of the coupling constant , is similar in nature to the one found by us in qed@xmath2  @xcite , where it constituted a reflection of the possible ill behavior of the perturbation series  @xcite .    the solutions of the set of nonlinear equations  ( [ eq : deleq][eq : taueq ] ) involving gauge parameter @xmath102 can , in general , be gauge dependent . to clarify this point we performed a couple of plots of the model parameters for different gauges , i.e. for @xmath133 , the last case corresponding to the landau gauge . in figure",
    "[ fig : graph3 ] the dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath4 on @xmath102 is demonstrated .",
    "figure  [ fig : graph4 ] shows the same dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it may be easily seen , that , apart from the parameter @xmath4 , which is and may be obviously gauge dependent , all other values become practically gauge independent for weak coupling . to get the reliable results for strong coupling we need to go beyond the first approximation consisting of the simple assumptions  ( [ eq : dpr ] ) ,  ( [ eq : spr ] ) and  ( [ eq : verp ] ) .",
    "the same refers to other nonperturbative ( but not exact ) calculations .    at the end",
    "we would like to note , that from the dependence of @xmath6 ( figure  [ fig : graph2 ] and figure  [ fig : graph4 ] ) one sees , that for certain values of parameter @xmath104 we have @xmath134 ( i.e. @xmath135 ) .",
    "assuming value @xmath136 as fixed , the equations  ( [ eq : deleq])([eq : taueq ] ) may be in turn solved for @xmath104 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 . in the case of the landau",
    "gauge the following values are obtained @xmath137 from which we get the generated masses ( the lagrangian in this case does not contain any masses ) to be @xmath138 and the parity becomes broken .",
    "for two other parameters we find @xmath139    a comment should be made here .",
    "the obtained result of parity breaking is not at variant with vafa - witten theorem  @xcite stating , that there is no spontaneous parity breaking in theories with vectorlike fermions .",
    "the three -dimensional qed with two - component fermions is very special theory also in that aspect , that it evades the proof of this theorem .",
    "the crucial point in the vafa s and witten s argument is the positivity of the boson measure ( after integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom ) which demands the positivity of the determinant of the dirac operator .",
    "this positivity may be easily proved in four component version of the theory , because by the application of the matrix @xmath10 one sees that eigenvalues are always paired in such a way that the unwanted signs cancel .",
    "however , in spinor version of qed no such @xmath10 matrix exists ( there is no matrix anticommuting with matrices @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) so the above argument fails .",
    "the results of  @xcite , which support the vafa - witten conclusion , are not in conflict with the present work either .",
    "they were obtained with the assumptions @xmath143 or @xmath144 , which correspond to @xmath145 or @xmath109 respectively , while in our case we have @xmath146 .",
    "on has to stress also , that the conclusions of  @xcite are got in the limit of infinitely many flavors , while we have one flavor theory .",
    "the number of flavors , particularly if it is even , may be essential for the positivity of the determinant spoken above .",
    "below we collect the set of integrals involving spectral density  ( [ eq : ro ] ) , that we used in sections  [ sec : dsb ] and  [ sec : dsf ] .",
    "first one can find that for @xmath147 , one has @xmath148 and similarly @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the euler function . from the former result by the appropriate substitution we obtain @xmath151 where we additionally used the relation @xmath152    with a slight modification of  ( [ eq : rhoi ] ) and  ( [ eq : rhoii ] ) one can easily get the other set of integrals : @xmath153    from  ( [ eq : rho1a ] ) one finds @xmath154 and also @xmath155    the last integral , we will need , is lengthy and therefore we will not give it in its full complexity . happily in section  [ sec : dsf ] only singular terms when @xmath86 are necesssary :    @xmath156",
    "the parametric integrals needed for the vacuum polarization tensor in section  [ sec : dsb ] are        in section  [ sec : dsf ] there appear two other parametric integrals , we denoted by @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( formulae  ( [ eq : s12a ] ) and  ( [ eq : s12b ] ) ) , which may , after elementary calculation , be expressed by simple functions : @xmath161\\ ; , \\label{eq : s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 and @xmath90 were defined in equations  ( [ eq : k1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : k2 ] ) .",
