    "more importantly , however , chiral symmetry is also broken spontaneously by the vacuum and the corresponding goldstone boson is the pion .",
    "thus , it is generally accepted that chiral symmetry underlines the dynamics of soft pions . in particular ,",
    "the low energy @xmath0 scattering lengths can be calculated using current algebra and pcac . in the seminal paper , based on these constraints",

    "further , chiral symmetry can also be used to constrain low energy , effective theories describing pion - hadron interactions .",
    "for example in the linear @xmath10 model , chiral symmetry enforces delicate cancellations between direct @xmath0 interactions and @xmath10-exchange contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "concurrently , the advent of qcd has spawned the development of more fundamental , microscopic formulations with quark degrees of freedom and low energy hadronic phenomena has been successfully described by various constituent quark models .",
    "however , because constituent quark models generally do not respect chiral symmetry , the goldstone nature of the pion is lost and there is no fundamental difference between pion and , for example , the @xmath11 meson .",
    "consequently , such models should not be expected to properly describe low energy pion scattering .",
    "it is , however , possible to construct quark models implementing chiral symmetry , such as the rainbow - ladder truncation of the set of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations [ dse ] and the instantaneous hamiltonian approach using the random phase approximation [ rpa ] , which preserve the pion s goldstone nature . for such models",
    "it is remarkable that both calculated observables and attending mathematical relationships governed by chiral symmetry are largely model independent , even though gauge dependent nonobservable constructs , such as quark and gluon propagators , can be very model sensitive .",
    "the pion mass is a quintessential example since for massless quarks this mass is zero , regardless of the form of the effective interaction _ provided _ that there is spontaneous dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath13-@xmath13 scattering near threshold is governed by this symmetry and any model that preserves chirality should reproduce weinberg s scattering lengths .    the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that for a microscopic quark formulation with an arbitrary , but chiral symmetry preserving , quark - antiquark interaction weinberg s results can indeed be explicitly obtained , and that a correct description of low - energy @xmath13-@xmath13 scattering emerges .",
    "the crucial step is to realize that there are important higher order contributions to @xmath13-@xmath13 scattering which , in the chiral limit , must exactly cancel the impulse contribution to recover the adler zero .",
