    "in conventional quark models , all established baryons are ascribed into simple 3-quark ( qqq ) configurations  @xcite .",
    "the excited baryon states are described as excitation of individual constituent quarks , similar to the cases for atomic and nuclear excitations . however , unlike atomic and nuclear excitations , the typical hadronic excitation energies are comparable with constituent quark masses . hence to drag out a @xmath4 pair from gluon field could be a new excitation mechanism besides the conventional orbital excitation of original constituent quarks .",
    "some baryon resonances are proposed to be meson - baryon dynamically generated states  @xcite or states with large ( @xmath5 ) components  @xcite .",
    "a difficulty to pin down the nature of these baryon resonances is that the predicted states from various models are around the same energy region and there are always some adjustable ingredients in each model to fit the experimental data .",
    "a typical example is @xmath6 which has large couplings to the strangeness . in the 3-quark ( qqq )",
    "configurations , it is described as the orbital angular momentum @xmath7 excitation of a quark . but phenomenological studies suggest that it may be a quasi - bound state of @xmath8 system  @xcite , or a hidden strangeness 5-quark state  @xcite . in order to clearly demonstrate the new excitation mechanism with some of its corresponding states , in ref.@xcite , the meson - baryon coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge formalism was performed for the hidden charm sector and several narrow @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances with hidden charm were predicted to exist .",
    "if found experimentally , these resonances definitely could not be described as three constituent quark states . here , we extend the study to the hidden beauty sector . some super - heavy @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances with hidden beauty are predicted to exist , with mass around 11 gev and width smaller than 10 mev .",
    "if these resonances would be experimentally confirmed , they should be part of the heaviest super - heavy island of @xmath0 and @xmath1 state . as a guild to the future experimental search for these new predicted states , their production cross sections in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions are estimated .",
    "in the next section , we present the formalism and ingredients for the study of interactions between heavy beauty meson and baryon with the valencia approach , and give some detailed discussion on the intermediate meson - baryon loop g functions . in section  [ s3 ] , our numerical results for the masses and widths of the predicted super - heavy @xmath0 and @xmath1 states are given , followed by a discussion . in section  [ s4 ] ,",
    "effects of momentum dependent terms in the effective potential are investigated . in section  [ s5 ] ,",
    "the calculation about production of these predicted states from @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions is presented .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "we follow the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite on the interactions between charmed mesons and baryons , and replace charm quark by beauty quark .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions by exchanging a vector meson are considered , as shown by the feynman diagrams in fig .",

    "the effective lagrangians for the interactions involved are  @xcite : @xmath32\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_{ppv}&=&-ig\\langle v^\\mu[p,\\partial_\\mu p]\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_{bbv}&=&g ( \\langle\\bar{b}\\gamma_\\mu [ v^\\mu , b]\\rangle+\\langle\\bar{b}\\gamma_\\mu b\\rangle\\langle v^\\mu\\rangle)\\ \\label{eq : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for pseudoscalar and vector mesons of the 16-plet of su(4 ) , respectively .    using the same approach of ref.@xcite , we keep only the @xmath35 component of eq.([eq : lag ] ) , while the three momentum versus the mass of the meson can be neglected under the low energy approximation .",
    "similarly , the @xmath36 term in the vector meson propagator is neglected so that the propagator is approximately equal to @xmath37 .",
    "note when we consider transitions from heavy mesons to light ones later on , we perform the exact calculation without such approximation . then with @xmath38 the transition potentials corresponding to the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fe ] are given by @xmath39 where the @xmath40 stand for different channels of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath43 is the energy of corresponding particle .",
    "the @xmath44 is the polarization vector of the initial or final vector . and the @xmath45 component is neglected consistently with taking @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the momentum of the vector meson .",
    "here we only change the charm quark to beauty quark , so the @xmath48 coefficients are exactly the same as those in ref.@xcite , so that there are only two cases , ( i , s ) = ( 1/2 , 0 ) and ( 0 , -1 ) , which have attractive potentials .",
    "we list the values of the @xmath48 coefficients for @xmath9 for these two cases in table i and table ii , respectively .    .",

    "( [ vpbb ] ) for @xmath49 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ coupling ]    as usual , the off - shell form factors should be considered here .",
    "we use two kinds of form factors for mesons and baryons , respectively .",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 stands for @xmath52 or @xmath28 , and @xmath53 stands for @xmath54 or nucleon pole . here",
    "@xmath55  gev , @xmath56  gev .",
    "to produce the predicted @xmath57 in the pp collisions , the center - of - mass energy should be above 12 gev . in fig.[exp ] , the left figure shows our theoretical estimated total cross section for the @xmath58 reaction through the @xmath59 production vs the center - of - mass energy , with ( dashed curve ) and without ( solid curve ) including the off - shell form factors . as an estimation of background contribution to the @xmath59 production",
    ", we also calculate the corresponding cross section through the off - shell nucleon pole without including the form factors .",
    "the result is shown by the dotted curve .",
    "the contribution from the nucleon pole is much smaller than that from the @xmath59 production , because the nucleon pole is much more off - shell than @xmath59 .",
    "the contribution of the nucleon pole with form factors becomes very small for the same reason , so it is not shown in fig.[exp ] .",
    "this background reaction will not influence the observation of the @xmath59 production , especially for the energy range of @xmath60  gev .",
    "the cross section from @xmath59 production is about 0.1 nb , which is much smaller than that for the corresponding reaction @xmath61 with @xmath62 production  @xcite of about 0.1 @xmath63 .",
    "the main reason is that both couplings of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are much smaller than the corresponding @xmath66 and @xmath67 couplings .",
    "these two vertices cause a reduction of about 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , because the center - of - mass energy here is much larger than that in the previous calculation for the @xmath68 production , the propagator of exchanged @xmath69 further reduces the contribution . for the same reason ,",
    "the contribution with form factors is much less than that without them .",
    "reaction ( left ) and @xmath70 reaction ( right ) , with ( dashed curves ) and without ( solid curves ) including off - shell form factors , through production of the predicted @xmath71 resonances .",
    "the dotted curve is the background contribution from the nucleon pole for the @xmath58 reaction without including form factors.,title=\"fig : \" ]   reaction ( left ) and @xmath70 reaction ( right ) , with ( dashed curves ) and without ( solid curves ) including off - shell form factors , through production of the predicted @xmath71 resonances .",

    "the right figure in fig.[exp ] shows our calculated total cross section for the @xmath70 reaction vs the invariant mass of the system with ( dashed curve ) and without ( solid curves ) including form factors .",
    "the cross section of this reaction is much larger than that for the @xmath58 reaction .",
    "the reason is due to the propagator of massless photon .",
    "the propagator of photon is given as the following : @xmath73 where the @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the three - momentum and energy of initial @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , @xmath78 for final @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath79 is the angle between initial and final @xmath76 . when the directions of initial and final @xmath76 are the same , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 , the value of eq.([phog ] ) becomes very large because of the very small mass of @xmath76 . as the beam momentum of @xmath76 becomes larger , the propagator of photon can reach very big value .",
    "for the invariant mass of the system less than 15  gev , the cross section of @xmath81 reaction is of the same order of magnitude as that of @xmath58 reaction .",
    "in summary , the meson - baryon coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge formalism is extended to the hidden beauty sector .",
    "two @xmath71 states and four @xmath82 states are predicted to be dynamically generated from coupled pb and vb channels with the same approach as for the hidden charm sector  @xcite . because of the hidden @xmath83 components involved in these states , the masses of these states are all above 11 gev while their widths are of only a few mev , which should form part of the heaviest island for the quite stable @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons .",
    "the nature of these states is similar as corresponding @xmath84 and @xmath85 states predicted in ref.@xcite , which definitely can not be accommodated by the conventional 3q quark models .",
    "production cross sections of the predicted @xmath59 resonances in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions are estimated as a guide for the possible experimental search at relevant facilities in the future . for the @xmath58 reaction , the best",
    "center - of - mass energy for observing the predicted @xmath59 is @xmath60 gev , where the production cross section is about 0.01 nb . for the @xmath70 reaction ,",
    "when the center - of - mass energy is larger than 14 gev , the production cross section should be larger than 0.1 nb .",
    "nowadays , the luminosity for pp or ep collisions can reach @xmath86 , this will produce more than 1000 events per day for the @xmath59 production .",
    "we expect future facilities , such as proposed electron - ion collider ( eic )  @xcite , to discover these very interesting super - heavy @xmath0 and @xmath1 with hidden beauty .",
