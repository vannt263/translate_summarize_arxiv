    "traffic flow that displays various complex behaviors is a kind of many - body systems of strongly interacting vehicles .",
    "one of the approaches to microscopic traffic processes is based on cellular automaton ( ca ) @xcite , which treats the motions of cars as hopping processes on one - dimensional lattices . in the past few decades , ca models for traffic flow have attracted much interest of a community of physicists @xcite . compared with other dynamical approaches , for instance the fluid dynamical approach , ca models are conceptually simpler , and can be easily implemented on computers for numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "two popular one - dimensional ( 1d ) ca models are the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) model @xcite and the fukui - ishibashi ( fi ) model @xcite , where periodic boundary conditions are used to mimic the traffic flow on highway . an exact car - oriented mean field theory ( comf )",
    "have been developed to study the fi model , with an arbitrary limit on the maximum speed @xmath0 , car density @xmath1 , and the delay probability @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "so far as we know , however , there has been no established exact analytical theory for the ns model , due to the complications in the time evolution of the flow caused by the acceleration and stochastic delay rules . in order to comprehend how these rules affect the evolution and the corresponding asymptotic steady state , we study a 1d traffic flow ca model which combines the ns stochastic delay rule and the fi acceleration mechanism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the definition of the model and the evolution equations for the inter - car spacings .",
    "next , we present the fundamental diagrams of the average speed and vehicle flux depending on the vehicle density and stochastic delay probability , compared with the numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "iv , we summary with a discussion of our results in connection with the fi and ns models .",
    "the modified nagel - schreckenberg model with the fukui - ishibashi acceleration rule is a probabilistic automaton , in which space and time are discrete and hence also the velocities .",
    "the road of length @xmath3 is divided into cells of certain length , each of which can either be empty or occupied by just one car .",
    "the state of the @xmath4th car ( @xmath5 ) is characterized by the momentary velocity @xmath6 ; in this model , the maximum speed is fixed as @xmath7 , and the vehicle density is @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 represent the number of empty sites in front of the @xmath4th vehicle at the time step @xmath10 , then we have @xmath11 as a function of the inter - car spacing @xmath9 and the stochastic delay probability @xmath2 , the velocity of the @xmath4th car at time step @xmath10 can be written as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 here , as one can see , we have approximately adopted the acceleration rule introduced by fukui and ishibashi . the fi model can be considered as a ns model for  aggressive driving \" , since the rules of the fi are nearly identical to the ns model , except that the acceleration rule has been changed from ",
    "the vehicle speed is at most increased by 1 at each step \" to  every car accelerates to @xmath0 \" ( which is adopted in the present model ) and the stochastic delay mechanism has been modified as  only cars with @xmath0 will delay stochastically \" ( which is not adopted here ) . for @xmath0=1 ,",
    "this may not change anything , however , for higher velocities it will lead to a considerable enhancement of the flow .",
    "although the model is less realistic than the ns , it is still of interest due to its simplicity .",
    "the analytical description of the present model is of course much simpler than that of the ns , and hence it might serve as a testing ground for new analytical methods as well as new models .    if @xmath14 represents the number of inter - car spacings with length @xmath15 at time @xmath10 , then the probability of finding such a spacing at time @xmath10 is @xmath16 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath17 will indicated by @xmath18 for simplicity , except if specified otherwise .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the probability that an arbitrary vehicle moves @xmath15 sites during a given time step , then we have : @xmath20 obviously , @xmath21 when @xmath22 , since the maximum inter - car spacing must be less than @xmath23 . to obtain the nonvanishing @xmath18",
    ", we introduce @xmath24 to denote the probability of finding an inter - car spacing with length @xmath15 at a given time which changes into length @xmath25 at the next time .",
    "according to the eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) , one can write all the nonzero @xmath24 as follows :    @xmath26,\\quad ( 1\\leq i\\leq m-1,1\\leq j\\leq m , i\\neq j)\\\\      w_{i\\rightarrow m+1}=p_ifq_m,\\quad ( 1\\leq i\\leq m-1)\\\\      w_{i\\rightarrow i - m}=p_i(1-f)q_0,\\quad ( i\\geq m)\\\\      w_{i\\rightarrow i-(m - j)}=p_i[fq_{j-1}+(1-f)q_j],\\quad ( i\\geq m,1\\leq j\\leq m-1)\\\\      w_{i\\rightarrow i+1}=p_ifq_m,\\quad ( i\\geq m)\\\\      w_{i\\rightarrow j}=0,\\quad { \\rm otherwise . }    \\end{array}\\ ] ]    when the system approaches its asymptotic steady state , all the @xmath27 will cease to change ; thus the detailed statistical equilibrium condition for the steady state holds : @xmath28    since there are @xmath29 variables @xmath30 in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , which satisfy the following two normalization equations : @xmath31 we should truncate eqs . ( 6 ) and obtain other @xmath32 equations . in the present paper , we will choose the @xmath32 equations with @xmath33 from 0 to @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we will have @xmath29 independent equations , from which one can readily work out the values of @xmath30 , then the average speed of the traffic in the steady state is :    @xmath35+\\sum_{i = m+1}^{l - n } p_i[(m-1)f+m(1-f)]\\\\      = \\sum_{i=1}^{m } ip_i+\\sum_{i =",
    "m+1}^{l - n } mp_i - f(1-p_0 )      \\end{array}\\ ] ]    based on the above discussions , one can easily obtain the traffic flux of the steady state : @xmath36",

    "the analysis of the dynamical evolution of our model give us a clearly physical picture of how the acceleration and stochastic delay rules affect the evolution and the corresponding asymptotic steady state .",
