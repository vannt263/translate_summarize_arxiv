    "despite decades of intensive research , the connection between dynamics and structure in glass - forming liquids remains elusive . as a matter of fact , this is likely one main reason that explains the difficulty in producing a comprehensive theory of the glass transition@xcite .",
    "the structure of glass - forming liquids , as experimentally probed through the static structure factors or equivalently the pair correlation functions , does not appear to change much when temperature is decreased toward the glass transition while under the same condition , the relaxation time dramatically increases by orders of magnitudes . to incorporate this , rather central , observation ,",
    "several working hypotheses have been proposed : ( i ) do away with the statics and assign the slowdown of relaxation to purely dynamical features such as emerging kinetic constraints@xcite , ( ii ) focus on structural quantities that go beyond the pair density correlations and represent higher - order and subtler correlations between particles@xcite , ( iii ) put forward mechanisms by which the small modifications of the static pair density correlations can be extremely amplified to produce spectacular dynamical changes .",
    "the theories based on ( i ) and ( ii ) , such as those involving dynamical facilitation@xcite , structural frustration@xcite or a random first - order transition@xcite , usually require some sort of phenomenological input , either because they involve some coarse - graining that introduces effective parameters only indirectly related to microscopic details or because they are intractactable in their full - blown generality and need approximate treatments .",
    "the paradigm of a type ( iii ) theory is the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition@xcite that predicts a freezing of the dynamics through a nonlinear feedback effect affecting the fluctuations of density .",
    "the appeal of so - called `` microscopic '' theories is that they are able to make predictions from the knowledge of the molecular properties , among which the interaction potentials@xcite . in the case of glass formation where it seems likely that some form of collective or cooperative behavior is at work and , correlatively , that some form of independence from the molecular details characterizes the phenomenology , it is not clear that this should necessarily be the best route to follow .",
    "in addition , `` microscopic '' theories of the glass transition involve strong , uncontrolled approximations that are usually not justified at a microscopic level .",
    "nonetheless , such theories are at least amenable to crisp tests on atomistic model systems .    in practice",
    ", `` microscopic '' approaches of the dynamics of glass - forming liquids are built on the knowledge of the static two - body density correlation functions ( the static structure factors in fourier space ) .",
    "the latter encode the microscopic information but represent only a partial description of the liquid structure .",
    "the issue we address here then boils down to the following question : how far can one go with the idea that the small observed changes in the static structure factors are sufficient to describe the slowdown of relaxation in glass - forming liquids ?",
    "the approaches we consider in this paper , with various degrees of exhaustivity and depth , are the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , for which we shall mostly summarize the results obtained in our previous study@xcite , the `` microscopic '' implementations of the random first - order transition ( rfot ) theory through density functional theory@xcite or replica formalism@xcite , an approach that mix aspects of the mct with thermally activated events@xcite , and finally a proposed correlation between the dynamics of a glassformer and its static pair correlation functions via the two - body contribution to the excess entropy@xcite . to test these approaches ,",
    "we have used as a benchmark the glass - forming systems that we have already extensively investigated by computer simulation@xcite : the kob - andersen binary lennard - jones model and its wca ( for weeks - chandler - andersen@xcite ) reduction to truncated , purely repulsive potentials .",
    "these two models have been shown to share very similar static pair density correlation functions while displaying increasingly distinct evolution of their relaxation times as temperature decreases .",
    "a wide range of densities can moreover be considered , from low densities near the liquid - gas spinodal of the full binary lennard - jones mixture to high densities at which the difference between the two models progressively vanishes , through the conventional liquid / supercooled liquid range .",
    "we find that the approaches based on the pair correlation functions , or equivalently on the static structure factors , are unsuccessful in describing the difference in the dynamical behavior of the two glass - forming models , the binary lennard - jones mixture and its wca reduction .",
    "this is true even after applying for some theories a global rescaling of the predictions to better fit the simulation data for one model , say the binary lennard - jones one ( in absolute terms , the predictions are indeed never very good ) : the difference in the slowdown of relaxation of the two models is still not correctly accounted for . as already mentioned , our study is not exhaustive , and we have not tested the effect of adding corrections to the description in terms of static pair correlations by including for instance three - body density correlations .",
    "in addition , we have chosen to focus on simple glass - formers . yet ,",
    "our results appear strong enough to challenge the claim that the viscous slowing down of glass - forming liquids , for which it is well established that the changes of the static structure factor with temperature are small , can be explained by `` microscopic '' approaches essentially based on the knowledge of the static pair density correlations .",
    "the glass - forming systems that we consider are the three - dimensional kob - andersen binary lennard - jones mixture@xcite ( denoted lj in the following ) and its reduction to the purely repulsive part of the pair potentials proposed by weeks , chandler and andersen@xcite ( denoted wca in the following ) . these are 80:20 mixtures of @xmath0:@xmath1 atoms with interatomic pair potentials @xmath2 , \\ ; { \\rm for } \\ ; r \\leq r_{\\alpha \\beta}^c \\\\ & = 0 , \\ ; { \\rm for } \\ ; r \\geq",

    "the molecular dynamics simulations have been performed in the @xmath9 ensemble , after equilibration at the chosen temperature , with @xmath10 particles , and we have studied a broad range of densities @xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( a detailed description of the phase diagram is given in ref .",
    "lengths , temperatures , and times are given in units of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "these systems form a benchmark for the kind of investigation that we want to carry out as their equilibrium pair structure is very close while their dynamics strongly diverge as temperature is lowered@xcite .",
    "note that the two models should be considered at the same density ( pressure is very sensitive to the presence or absence of attractive forces ) .",
    "the observables that we measure in the simulation are the partial static structure factors @xmath17 and pair correlation functions @xmath18 as well as the self - intermediate scattering functions @xmath19 with @xmath20 near the position of the peak of the static structure factor at the most commonly studied liquid density @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) ; we extract the relaxation time from the latter , with the conventional choice @xmath23 .",
    "the `` microscopic '' approaches of the dynamics of glass - forming liquids that we assess by comparing to simulation data on the above benchmark systems comprise first what can be taken as _ bona fide _ theories , the mode - coupling theory ( mct)@xcite and the random first - order transition ( rfot ) theory@xcite .    the mct ( for more detail , see our previous article@xcite ) is based on a nonlinear differential equation for the time evolution of the two - point correlator of the density fluctuations .",
    "it can be derived for a newtonian or for a brownian dynamics , and , since the latter is somewhat simpler and leads to the same behavior at long times , this is the one that we have used .",
    "the time dependence of the intermediate scattering functions ( two - point correlator of the density fluctuations ) for the liquid mixture is then governed by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the diffusion coefficient of an isolated brownian particle and @xmath26 is the matrix formed by the intermediate scattering functions @xmath27 [ such that @xmath28 .",
    "the physics is contained in the so - called memory kernel @xmath29 whose explicit form is derived through a series of approximations from the exact but intractable formal expression ; it is a functional of the intermediate scattering functions @xmath26 ( taken at the same time @xmath30 ) and , in the common implementation of the theory , of the static structure factors @xmath31 : @xmath32\\\\ & \\times f_{\\gamma \\gamma'}(\\vert \\mathbf q - \\mathbf k \\vert , t)\\ , f_{\\delta \\delta'}(k , t ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression of @xmath33 is given in ref .",
    "( note that in principle this expression involves the static triplet correlation function but the latter is almost always considered in a factorized approximation . ) in this formulation , the only nontrivial input is therefore the partial static structure factors @xmath17 .",
    "an equation can also be derived for the intermediate scattering functions @xmath19@xcite .",
    "however , it is known that for wave - vectors corresponding to typical interatomic distances the temperature dependences of the relaxation times associated with the collective and the self - intermediate scattering functions are similar and , moreover , that the predicted critical temperatures @xmath34 at which the dynamics freezes are identical@xcite .",
    "the second type of theory that we shall test are microscopic implementations of the random first - order transition ( rfot ) theory .",
    "the latter builds on an analogy with the behavior of mean - field spin glasses without reflection symmetry@xcite .",
    "it provides a scenario for the slowdown of relaxation in glass - forming liquids that focuses on the free - energy landscape , which is postulated to be characterized by an exponentially large number of `` metastable '' states and the associated configurational entropy ( or complexity ) , and on an entropy - driven activated relaxation , which leads to a heterogeneous `` mosaic '' liquid state@xcite .",
    "microscopic implementations of the rfot theory can be realized at a mean - field level where free - energy `` metastable '' states have an infinite life - time and are therefore properly defined .",
    "they can be formulated either in terms of a density functional approach ( dft)@xcite or within a replica formalism@xcite . in these mean - field - like approaches",
    ", one does not have a direct access to the dynamics of the system but indirect information is provided through the configurational entropy and the two critical temperatures , @xmath35 at which the complexity jumps to a finite value and @xmath36 at which the complexity vanishes .    in the dft treatment , one looks for the density profiles that minimize some appropriately derived ( mean - field ) density functional .",
    "the main steps are the formulation of the density functional itself and the _ a priori _ characterization of the structure of the metastable states in terms of trial ( amorphous or `` aperiodic''@xcite ) density profiles .",
    "the commonly considered helmoltz free - energy functional is the ramakrishanan - yussouff@xcite approximation which involves a taylor series expansion ( truncated after the quadratic term ) of the excess free energy around the liquid phase with mean density @xmath37 . for a one - component liquid , it is expressed as @xmath38= \\int d\\mathbf r\\ , \\rho(\\mathbf r ) \\left ( \\ln[\\lambda^3\\ , \\rho(\\mathbf r ) ] - 1\\right ) + \\mathcal f^{ex}(\\rho_0)\\\\&-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf r_1 \\int d\\mathbf r_2\\ , c(\\vert \\mathbf r_1-\\mathbf r_2\\vert;\\rho_0)[\\rho(\\mathbf r_1)-\\rho_0][\\rho(\\mathbf r_2)-\\rho_0 ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term of the right - hand side is the ideal - gas functional , with @xmath39 the thermal wavelength , and @xmath40 is the excess free energy of a homogeneous liquid of density @xmath37 ; @xmath41 is the direct correlation function of the homogeneous liquid and is related to the pair correlation function @xmath42 through the ornstein - zernike integral equation@xcite .",
    "the density profiles @xmath43 of the metastable states are generally described through a sum of gaussian functions centered about a given amorphous ( or aperiodic ) lattice , with the width of the gaussians characterized by a variational localization parameter on which the minimization of the free energy is then performed . in practice",
    ", the amorphous lattice is chosen from a random close packing of hard spheres with some effective diameter .",
    "additional approximations can also be introduced in order to further simplify the computations@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach uses the replica formalism , which allows one to directly study the statistical properties of the metastable states and the configurational entropy . to this end",
    ", one introduces @xmath44 replicas of the original liquid system and , if one is only interested in the liquid above the putative rfot to an ideal - glass phase , one considers the difference between the free energy in the limit @xmath45 ( after having taken the thermodynamic limit ) and the homogeneous liquid value obtained for @xmath46@xcite . at low enough temperature , one expects the atoms in the @xmath44 copies to cluster around around common positions in space , thereby forming a `` molecular bound state '' and one can use a `` small cage expansion '' around typical liquid configurations in the spirit of the einstein description of a crystal ( in the dft context , this would correspond to the self - consistent phonon approximation@xcite ) .",

    ", we shall therefore illustrate the ability of such calculations to reproduce the differing behavior of the wca and lj models by studying the complexity and @xmath36 via the replica formalism and the small cage expansion .",

    "this is somewhat expected as the approximations involved in the theoretical formulations are quite uncontrolled and serious , while the phenomenology to be described is quite rich and complex . in approaches such as the mct and the rfot theory ,",
    "a way to get around this is to implement some rescaling procedure to make predictions and simulation data on one type of observable fare as well as possible and use this rescaling to compare the predictions for other observables or phenomena .",

    ", one could for instance envisage considering trial amorphous configurations that already account for the subtle structural differences between the wca and the lj liquid ; or , in the sought correlation between dynamics and excess entropy , one could consider the exact excess entropy as in ref .",
    "[ ] in place of its two - body contribution .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this improves the predictions , and we hope that the present work will stimulate further investigations along these lines .",
    "we would like to stress again that the above conclusions apply to glass - forming _ liquids _ , for which it is well established that the dramatic slowdown of relaxation comes with only minor changes in the equilibrium pair density correlations . for fluids able to be taken at low temperature and low density , such as systems interacting with truncated repulsive potentials , possibly supplemented by short - ranged attractive interactions , a wide thermodynamic range can be covered within which the static pair correlation functions may show marked and nontrivial evolution@xcite . the ability of theories based on the static pair structure to grasp some qualitative and quantitative trends is then less challengeable in this case .    finally , we note that the present study has obviously nothing to say about theories of glass formation that rely , at least in principle , on more than the static pair density correlations , involving either higher - order static correlations or kinetic constraints ( see introduction ) .",
    "such theories however are not microscopic in the sense that phenomenological input is necessary , either because the full blown theory is intractable ( at present ) or because some pieces connecting to the microscopic details are still missing .",
    "a crisp test of the type proposed here is therefore harder to envisage .",
    "in this appendix , we check our implementation of the schweizer - saltzman approach for the binary lj and wca liquids by applying it to the hard - sphere model already extensively studied by these authors@xcite .",
    "we obtain the static pair structure using three methods : we solve both the hnc and py integral equations for a monodisperse system of hard spheres to get @xmath59 , or we follow the same procedure as in the main text and measure @xmath86 for the majority component of a binary mixture of hard spheres to use the same effective one - component approximation .",
    "we then inject this structural information into eq .",
    "( [ eq_schweizer ] ) to obtain a prediction for the relaxation time which we represent either as a function of the volume fraction @xmath93 , or as a function of the reduced pressure ( or compressibility factor ) , @xmath94 .",
    "the latter is evaluated from the carnahan - stirling equation of state , which is quite accurate even in the high-@xmath93 regime that we wish to discuss  @xcite .",
    "the results of the two theoretical approaches using hnc and py are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure_schweizer_hs1 ] , and they fully match published results@xcite , which shows that we have correctly implemented the schweizer - saltzman approach . it should be noted that when plotted in the representation @xmath95 versus @xmath96 , these data appear almost linear , which seems to suggest that in the @xmath93 regime relevant to most simulations and experiments , the schweizer - saltzman approach seems to yield results similar to the free volume approach @xmath97 , and that the asymptotic regime predicted by schweizer@xcite , @xmath98 , is not entered .",
    "it is not possible to obtain numerical results for a monodisperse system of hard spheres to assess these theoretical predictions directly because the system crystallizes too easily .",
    "however , it is well - known that slightly polydisperse systems and binary mixtures can easily be compressed toward the glass transition with no sign of crystallisation and very little effect of polydispersity on the actual location of the glass `` transition''@xcite .",
    "thus , we use numerical results@xcite obtained for a @xmath99:@xmath99 mixture of hard spheres with diameter ratio @xmath100 , and present them along with the theoretical results in fig .",
    "[ figure_schweizer_hs1 ] .",
    "this comparison appears reasonable as schweizer and saltzman themselves compare their predictions with results obtained from simulations and experiments performed on polydisperse systems .",
    "the comparison with numerically measured relaxation times confirms the conclusions drawn from the study of the lj potential that the schweizer - saltzman expression of the free - energy barrier considerably underestimates the slowing down of the dynamics .",
    "this is more easily seen in the bottom panel which shows that numerical data have a much larger `` kinetic fragility '' ( they are well described@xcite by @xmath101 with @xmath102 ) than the theoretical ones , as also found for the lj / wca systems .",
    "we note that the use of integral equations as input for the theory has two conflicting effects : on the one hand , integral equations tend to overestimate the structure of the fluid ( which should yield larger barriers ) , but on the other hand they are not sensitive to the proximity of the jamming transition , a transition which is not captured by simple liquid - state approaches ( close to jamming this would imply that barriers are underestimated ) .    finally , as for the lj and wca models in the main text , we use the numerically measured structure factor @xmath86 for the main component ( larger particles ) and the effective one - component approximation for the free energy barrier .",
    "although the approximation is expected to be less accurate in this 50:50 mixture than for the 80:20 lj / wca systems , we find a trend very similar to the one reported in the main text , namely that integral equations seem to largely overestimate the evolution of the structure and that direct use of the `` exact '' structural information yields theoretical predictions in even stronger disagreement with the simulations .",
    "this short study of the hard - sphere systems therefore validates our implementation of the schweizer - saltzman approach for the binary lj and wca liquids in the main text , and , as a way of consequence , the conclusions we have drawn from fig .  [ figure_schweizer1 ] .",
    "if the assumptions we made are correct , the last conclusions of the above appendix suggest that the agreement reported by schweizer and saltzman between their theoretical results and hard - sphere data is largely due a cancellation of errors between a dynamical theory which underestimates barriers , and the use of integral equations which promotes them . as a further check of our assumptions ,",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a four - dimensional hard - sphere system . indeed , in @xmath103 dimensions , a monodisperse system can be used with no crystallization issues  @xcite . in this case",
    "we can directly measure the ` exact ' structure factor in the simulations and use the schweizer - saltzman theory to predict the dynamics , which can be compared to numerical measurements . in this comparison , the free - energy barriers",
    "are then estimated without approximations ( whether due to polydispersity or to the computation of the structure factor ) and no assumption has to be made to implement the theory .",
    "we use the data obtained by charbonneau and coworkers in ref .  [ ] to obtain the results shown in fig .",
