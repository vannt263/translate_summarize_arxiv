    "thus , he paved the way for the birth of combinatorial spectral geometry , and he did so mostly by linear algebraic methods .",
    "other estimates on @xmath4 can be obtained exploiting different techniques , as observed by fiedler himself : indeed , it is well known that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the signed incidence matrix of an arbitrary orientation of the graph @xmath2 ( a discrete counterpart of the divergence operator ) , and therefore @xmath14 for instance , this formula immediately shows that deleting an edge decreases @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath28 is always the lowest ( and simple ! ) eigenvalue , hence we number our eigenvalues as @xmath29 it will be more natural to use a different numbering when we start changing our vertex conditions , see below .",
    "in a recent article  @xcite three of the current authors ( jbk , pk and dm ) and gabriela malenov investigated whether certain combinatorial or metric quantities associated with a quantum graph , alone or combined , are sufficient to yield upper and/or lower estimates on _ the spectral gap of a quantum graph _ ,",

    "the correction term in the denominator involving @xmath47 turns out to be necessary , as simple examples show ; see remark  [ rem : connectn1 ] .",
    "we remark that the natural condition at a vertex of degree one reduces to the neumann condition @xmath50 .",
    "when we consider upper and lower estimates for high eigenvalues in section  [ sec : qg_betti ] , it becomes necessary also to allow dirichlet conditions @xmath51 on vertices of degree one .",
    "for eigenvalue problems with some dirichlet conditions the more natural eigenvalue numbering is @xmath52 for uniformity , we will use this numbering throughout section  [ sec : qg_betti ] , whether the graph has any dirichlet vertices or not . using a symmetrization - based estimate ( essentially derived in the proof of theorem  [ thm : connectn ] ) , an interlacing lemma from @xcite and other surgery principles ( see , for example , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1.6 ) or @xcite ) , we provide concise proofs for several existing spectral gap estimates and discover new ( or improved ) ones .",

    "since we use variational techniques , we do not generally require linearity of the considered operators ; effectively , only homogeneity of the rayleigh quotients is used : this leads us to formulate most of our results for @xmath0-laplace operators as well ; in particular , this is true of our generalization of fiedler s theorem  [ thm : fiedler-2 ] , namely theorem  [ thm : fiedler - p ] , as well as theorem  [ thm : connectn ] .",

    "discrete @xmath0-laplacians have a much longer history that goes back to  @xcite , see  @xcite for references . while the theory of @xmath0-laplacians on domains and manifolds is very rich , and on graphs and quantum graphs would appear to have similar potential , all that we shall need is ( nonlinear ) variational eigenvalue characterizations entirely analogous to their linear counterparts : see for the combinatorial and for the metric case , respectively .",

    "[ assump : discrete ] the combinatorial graph @xmath2 is connected and consists of a finite number of vertices and edges .",
    "multiple edges between given pairs of vertices are allowed , but loops are not .",
    "allowing for multiple edges turns out to be natural in view of the relevant role played by the edges in the rayleigh quotient of the discrete laplacian @xmath5 .",
    "forbidding loops is a standard assumption in spectral graph theory , since the incidence value of a loop has no natural definition .",
    "most of our results are based on two general methods : symmetrization techniques ( originally adapted to quantum graphs in  @xcite ) , and general graph surgery .",
    "the laplacian of a combinatorial graph ( possibly with multiple edges ) satisfying assumption  [ assump : discrete ] is a square matrix @xmath5 of size @xmath3 .",

    "a straightforward calculation shows that the formula  , which is classical in the case of graphs with no multiple edges , is still true in our more general setting .",
    "it is immediate that 0 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath5 and the associated eigenspace is the space of constant functions .",
    "therefore , we are interested in the lowest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath4 of @xmath5 : fiedler s estimates in   clearly show that @xmath4 is a measure of the connectedness of the graph .",

    "it follows from simple compactness arguments that there is a vector @xmath79 achieving equality in .    in nonlinear operator theory",

    "note that we will leave the set of vertices intact , thus the same function can be used as a test function for all intermediate graphs .",

    "we claim that this operation decreases the rayleigh quotient of the function @xmath97 , @xmath111 indeed , this is equivalent to the assertion @xmath112 now by using the inequality @xmath113 between the @xmath0- and @xmath114-norms of a finite - dimensional vector ( which is strict as long as @xmath115 and the vector has more than one nonzero component ) , applied to @xmath116 we obtain @xmath117^{1/p }       & \\leq \\sum_{\\ell = i}^{j-1}|{f_1}({\\mathsf{v}}_{\\ell+1})-{f_1}({\\mathsf{v}}_\\ell)| \\\\      & = \\sum_{\\ell = i}^{j-1 } { f_1}({\\mathsf{v}}_{\\ell+1})-{f_1}({\\mathsf{v}}_\\ell ) = { f_1}({\\mathsf{v}}_j)-{f_1}({\\mathsf{v}}_i ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first equality here follows from the ordering of the vertices , equation  . taking the @xmath0-th power of both sides yields .",

    "we now remove excess edges , producing an @xmath1-regular pumpkin chain @xmath120 .",
    "it is immediate to see that removing an edge between @xmath121 and @xmath122 also decreases the rayleigh quotient ( strictly decreases if @xmath123 ) .",

    "however , it can be shown that any first nontrivial eigenfunction @xmath125 of the discrete @xmath0-laplacian on a regular pumpkin chain @xmath94 ( equivalently , on a path graph ) does not take on the same value on neighboring vertices ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.4.5 ) for the special case of @xmath82 ) .",
    "for such a test function @xmath125 , every subdivision of a `` long edge '' strictly decreases the rayleigh quotient ; so does every removal of an edge .",
