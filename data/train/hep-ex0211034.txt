    "according to dirac s theory , the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath1 of a lepton is exactly 2 .",

    "the anomaly of the electron is currently known at the level of 4ppb  @xcite and well in agreement with the standard model .",
    "since the contribution of heavy virtual particles to the anomaly @xmath2 is proportional to the square of the mass scale , the sensitivity of the muon is enhanced by a factor @xmath3 relative to the electron . at the present level of precision , the muon anomaly @xmath4 probes qed , weak and hadronic contributions .",

    "as explained later , @xmath7 is reflected by the rate of decay positrons above a certain energy threshold .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath13 is measured in terms of the free proton precession frequency @xmath14 in this field using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) probes .",
    "then , @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ratio of the magnetic moments of the muon to the proton , which has been measured with a precision of 30ppb  @xcite . to avoid experimenter biases ,",
    "a `` blind analysis '' strategy is pursued , separating the @xmath18 and @xmath14 analyses with secret offsets which are only revealed when both analyses are complete and internally consistent .",
    "the beam used for the experiment originates at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) which every 2.5s delivers 4060@xmath1910@xmath20 protons at 24 gev/@xmath11 onto a nickel target .",
    "each proton spill is composed of 12 bunches with a width of about 50 ns and a separation of  33ms .",
    "downstream of the target , pions at 3.1 gev/@xmath11 are selected into a 72 m long straight beam line where about half of them decay into muons . because of parity violation in the pion decay , the selection of forward - going muons leads to a polarisation of about 96% .",
    "muons at the magic momentum are selected and injected into the storage ring through a hole in the yoke of the dipole magnet whose 1.45 t field is locally cancelled by a dc super - conducting inflector magnet  @xcite . to move the muons onto the central orbit ,",

    "the muon storage region has a 9 cm diameter cross - section and a central radius of 7.112 m , corresponding to a cyclotron period of 149.2ns for muons at @xmath21 .",
    "a vertical air gap between pole and yoke decouples the yoke and pole pieces , which are fabricated from high quality steel , and allows the insertion of iron wedges to improve the field homogeneity by compensating the quadrupole field components .",
    "the four edge shims , 5 cm wide and about 3 mm high , are the main tool for reducing field variations over the beam cross - section .",
    "surface coils glued to the pole pieces are used to further reduce the inhomogeneity of the field .",
    "the field inside the storage region is mapped twice a week using a hermetically sealed cable - car with a matrix of 17 nmr probes moving on rails in the vacuum beam pipe and measuring a transverse field map about every 5 mm .",

    "an array of 375  nmr probes embedded in the top and bottom plates of the vacuum chamber is used to monitor magnetic field variations between trolley measurements and to stabilise the field with a feed - back loop to the main magnet power supply  @xcite .    two independent analyses determined @xmath24 , averaged over the muon distribution .",

    "the improvement from 0.4ppm systematic error in 1999 to 0.24ppm in 2000 comes mainly from the better field homogeneity ( figure  [ fig_fieldmap ] ) which was achieved by replacing the old inflector whose super - conducting fringe - field shield had a flux leak .    ",

    "( [ eqn_5parfit ] ) proved not to be adequate for fitting the spectrum which is affected by several significant perturbations .",
    "we shall concentrate here on the leading systematic effect caused by coherent betatron oscillations  oscillations of the beam as a whole . since the inflector aperture is smaller than the storage ring aperture ,",
    "the phase space for betatron oscillations is not filled , which leads to a radial modulation of beam width and centroid .",

    "the modulations @xmath49 and @xmath50 are smaller  0.1% and 1mrad at @xmath51 respectively  and were only discovered with the higher statistics of the 2000 data set .",
    "their dangerous effect on the time spectrum is the creation of interference terms with the frequency @xmath52 which for our choice of @xmath40 is very close to @xmath48 .",
    "this parametric resonance can produce shifts in @xmath48 of up to 4ppm if individual detector time spectra are fitted without including @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the sum of all detector spectra",
    ", the shifts largely cancel thanks to the circular symmetry of the ( g-2 ) ring .",
    "remaining effects are accounted for by including @xmath49 into the fit and assigning a systematic error for the impact of @xmath50 .",
    "including @xmath50 into the fit turned out to be more difficult because this term induces strong correlations between detector gain changes and @xmath48 , entailing further shifts in @xmath48 .",
    "other perturbations were treated like in earlier data sets  @xcite .",
    "pulse pileup effects were removed by statistically superimposing recorded pulses from the data themselves and thus constructing an artificial pileup spectrum which was then subtracted from the untreated spectrum .",
    "the effects of beam debunching were eliminated by randomizing the start time of each fill over one cyclotron period .",
    "muon losses were taken into account by multiplying the function in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_5parfit ] ) with an extra loss term .",
    "ags background due to erroneous proton extraction during the muon storage period , which contributed 0.1ppm uncertainty to the 1999 result , was largely eliminated by installing a sweeper magnet in the beam line .",
    "four independent @xmath48 analyses with different approaches to take systematic effects into account were completed .",
    "their results agreed within 0.4ppm  as compared to statistically allowed variations of 0.5ppm  and were combined to @xmath53hz ( 0.7ppm ) .",
