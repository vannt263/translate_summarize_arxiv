    "the universality and constancy of the laws of nature rely on the invariance of the fundamental constants . however , some recent measurements of quasar ( quasi - stellar objects - qso ) absorption line spectra suggest that the fine - structure constant , @xmath2 , @xcite may have had a different value during the early universe @xcite . other measurements ( e.g. @xcite ) do not show any change .",
    "the attempt to resolve these discrepancies can probe deviations from the standard model of particle physics and thus provide tests of modern theories of fundamental interactions that are hard to attain in other ways .",
    "qso absorption lines are used in these investigations to measure the wavelength separations of atomic lines in spectra of different elements - the many - multiplet method @xcite - and compare their values at large redshifts with their values today .",
    "any difference in the separations would suggest a change in @xmath2 . since this method uses many different species in the analysis that have differing sensitivities to changes in @xmath2 , it can be much more sensitive than previous methods , such as the alkali - doublet method @xcite , that use just one species .",
    "however , it requires very accurate laboratory wavelengths to be used successfully , since the observed changes in @xmath2 are only a few parts in 10@xmath3 , requiring laboratory wavelengths to 1:10@xmath4 or better .",
    "this has led to several recent measurements of ultraviolet wavelengths using both fourier transform ( ft ) spectroscopy @xcite and frequency comb metrology @xcite .",
    "one spectral line of particular interest is the @xmath5 line of fe  ii at 1608.45   .",
    "this line is prominent in many qso spectra and its variation with @xmath2 has the opposite sign from that of other nearby lines @xcite .",
    "however , measurement of its wavelength using frequency comb metrology , which is at present the most accurate method , is extremely difficult due to its short wavelength . although this line is strong in many of the ft spectra of iron - neon hollow cathode lamps recorded at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) and imperial college , london , uk ( ic ) , these spectra display inconsistencies in the wavelength of the 1608  line of around 1.5 parts in 10@xmath4 - too great for use in the many - multiplet method to detect changes in @xmath2 .",
    "we discussed some of these discrepancies in our previous paper @xcite presenting reference wavelengths in the spectra of iron , germanium and platinum around 1935   .    here",

    "we attributed this to a possible problem in the transfer of the wavenumber calibration of the fe  i and fe  ii lines from the region of the ar  ii wavenumber standards to the vacuum ultraviolet , thus suggesting that the wavenumber standards in @xcite are too small . in section [ cal_uv ] we have confirmed that the wavenumbers in tables 4 and 5 of nave et al .",
