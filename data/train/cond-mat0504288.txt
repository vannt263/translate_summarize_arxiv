    "recently , due to the rapid progress in nanotechnologies , quantum transport through dqd system has been the subject of active theoretical and experimental research.@xcite compared to the single quantum dot , the interdot coupling and the intradot on - site coulomb interaction in dqd system could generate novel many - body states , e. g. the molecular kondo state.@xcite apart from its importance in understanding some basic problems in condensed matter physics , the dqd devices are also crucial ingredients in the emerging field of spintronics and several quantum computation schemes designed with the electron spins or with the coherent mode in an artificial molecule.@xcite    transport through dqd system in the coulomb blockade and the kondo regimes has already received some theoretical attention , in which two dots are arranged in series,@xcite parallel@xcite or t-shape.kim01,boese02,cornaglia04 in most of these geometries , the conductance spectra have been studied for electron transport through the whole dqd system , while the electron transport through each individual dot could not be detected . in this paper",
    "we consider a new configuration of dqd system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) , in which each quantum dot is connected to two leads by the tunneling barriers . in this geometry , the collected electron transport phenomenon can be investigated by measuring the transport properties through one individual dot when tuning the level of another dot and its interdot coupling .",
    "the similar configuration of dqd system has been proposed in ref .",
    ", however , the detailed investigation on the spectral and conductance spectra , and the interplay between interdot tunneling coupling and intradot on - site coulomb interaction has been not discussed yet .    in this paper , by using the keldysh nonequilibrium green function technique and equation - of - motion method , we calculate the spectral and the conductance spectra of tunneling - coupled dqd with and without intradot coulomb interaction , respectively , in both the equilibrium limit and in the nonequilibrium case . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the model hamiltonian of the special geometry of dqd system , and deduce the current formula through each quantum dot .    in sec .",
    "iii , for dqd without the intradot coulomb interaction , we exactly calculate the green functions , from which both the spectral function and the conductance are obtained , showing the resonant peaks corresponding to the molecular resonant - tunneling bonding and anti - bonding states .",
    "the image of total differential conductance shows  anticrossing  phenomenon when the levels of two dots match .",
    "it is interesting to find that in the presence of interdot tunneling coupling , the electron transport through one dot is strongly influenced by the electron transport through another dot , namely , when setting dot 1 level ( @xmath0 ) and tuning dot 2 level ( @xmath1 ) the linear conductance of dot 1 ( @xmath2 ) shows a dip at the same position of @xmath1 , where the linear conductance of dot 2 ( @xmath3 ) displays a resonant peak .",
    "increasing the interdot tunneling coupling gives rise to a more complicate structure of linear conductances through each dot .    in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the hartree - fock approximation to dqd with the intradot coulomb interaction to truncate the equation of motion for the high - order green functions , which is known to capture the correct qualitative feature of physics of single quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime . under the same approximation",
    ", we also obtain the keldysh less green function , which is needed in the self - consistent evaluation of the dot occupation numbers when a finite bias voltage is applied across the system .",
    "as the intradot coulomb interaction becomes the largest energy scale in the single - electron tunneling regime of quantum dot , the intradot coulomb interaction leads to two groups of peaks in both the spectral and conductance spectra , and the interdot tunneling coupling causes the splitting of peaks in each group .",
    "compared to the case without the intradot coulomb interaction , when setting @xmath4 and tuning @xmath1 , one more dip in @xmath2 and resonant peak in @xmath5 will appear corresponding to the coulomb interaction energy , which also provides the clear evidence of the correlated electron transport through dqd system .",
    "the paper is closed with a brief summary in sec .",
    "quantum dots behave as artificial atoms and single - electron transistors in their charge and energy quantizations due to the small dimensions ( compared to the fermi wavelength ) .",
    "they are often described by the single - impurity anderson model , in which there is a coulomb repulsion between electrons in the dot .",
    "the parallel dqd system could be modelled by using a two - impurity anderson model with an extra interdot tunneling corresponding to the electrons hopping between two dots .",
