    "the term faraday waves refers to a surface density modulation generated by the interference of counterpropagating phonons excited by an oscillatory motion of a nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "the formation of faraday waves has been studied in several physical contexts @xcite , including convective fluids , nematic liquid crystals , nonlinear optics , biology , and , recently , in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . in the context of ultracold gases ,",
    "faraday patterns can be excited by the modulation of the scattering length @xcite or by varying the transverse trap confinement @xcite , the main ingredient being the modulation of the nonlinear interaction .",
    "the study of the formation of spatial structures in a quantum fluid confined in a smooth potential , such as the cigar - shaped harmonic trap used in the bec experiment @xcite , can give access to information about the excitation spectrum ( and thus about the equation of state of the system ) through the relation between the excitation frequency and the measured wave vector of the faraday wave .",
    "this is somehow similar to bragg spectroscopy on ultracold gases confined in an optical lattice , where the excitation spectrum is inferred by exposing the system to a periodic lattice modulation and measuring the energy absorption @xcite . proceeding along this line",
    ", one may expect to probe the spectrum of an ultracold gas , _ even in the presence of an optical lattice _",
    "@xcite , by observing the formation ( or the lack of formation ) of a faraday pattern for _ any _ lattice depth provided that the system remains compressible ( i.e. the lattice does not induces a superfluid - mott transition ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the presence of an optical lattice may dramatically alter the parametric excitation of faraday waves .",
    "in particular , we show that the formation of the faraday waves can be suppressed not only by the appearance of a gap in the spectrum of collective excitations , but also by the fact that the local flow of the condensate exceeds the landau critical velocity @xcite .",
    "we focus our study on a cigar - shaped condensate where phonons are parametrically excited by modulating the tight radial confinement at a frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the parametrically excited phonons have an energy @xmath1 and a faraday wavevector @xmath2 determined by the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "we add a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice along the axial direction , and , by increasing the lattice potential depth @xmath3 , we observe the suppression of the parametric excitation of phonons with wavevector @xmath4 , even if @xmath1 is still an allowed energy of the collective modes .",
    "the sound mode at @xmath4 , excited by the parametric instability , is submerged by several other modes excited by the dynamical instability .",
    "this instability can be related to the previously - studied instabilities in bosonic superfluid currents moving with respect to an optical lattice potential . in these set - ups",
    "the current remains stable if the superflow momentum does not exceed half the recoil momentum @xcite . at variance , as in our system the condensate center - of mass is at rest , the dynamical instability washing out the faraday pattern is due to a _ local _ supersonic flow through the periodic potential induced by the continuous driving of the radial breathing mode .",
    "indeed , we observe that the critical value @xmath5 at which faraday waves are suppressed corresponds to the critical value of the local bec flow @xcite .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .  [ sec : model ] we introduce the nonlinear schrdinger equations that describes the condensate in the elongated geometry .",
    "we make use of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gross - pitaevskii equation ( gp ) for the evaluation of the low - lying energy spectrum ( sec .",
