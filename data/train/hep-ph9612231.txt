    "one of the main features of qcd , the underlying theory of strong interactions , is the spontaneous breaking of its approximate su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) chiral symmetry .",
    "spontaneous breaking of this approximate symmetry explains the very small pion masses ; in the limit of exact chiral symmetry these particles would be massless goldstone bosons .",
    "another manifestation of this is the presence of a non - vanishing quark condensate in the vacuum .",
    "it is believed that at very high temperature a quark - gluon plasma is formed in which chiral symmetry is restored , and much effort is being made to explore such a phase transition by means of high - energy hadron or heavy - ion collisions .    to describe aspects of qcd related to this symmetry",
    "it is convenient to introduce a chiral four - vector of fields @xmath2 , where @xmath0 represents the quark condensate and the three @xmath3 are the pion fields . in the physical vacuum ,",
    "@xmath2 points in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "if the chiral symmetry were exact then there would be a  chiral circle \" of states degenerate with this vacuum states . in practice the symmetry is explicitly broken by the current quark masses and so there is a unique vacuum .    because of this circle of nearly degenerate field configurations ,",
    "as the chirally restored plasma cools and returns to the normal phase the system could form regions in which the chiral fields are misaligned , that is chirally rotated from their usual orientation along the @xmath0 direction .",
    "there has been much recent interest in this phenomenon , which is known as a disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) .",
    "if such a state were formed , it would lead to anomalously large event - by - event fluctuations in the ratio of charged to neutral pions .",
    "since the emergence of this idea@xcite , a lot of theoretical work has gone into developing suitable methods for modelling the phenomenon and in exploring how it could be used as a signal of a phase transition in high - energy nucleus - nucleus or hadron collisions ; reviews on the subject can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    a region of dcc",
    "can also be thought of as a coherent state of low - momentum pions . in order to produce such a state",
    "the hot plasma must evolve far from equilibrium and in particular it must reach an unstable configuration in which long - wavelength pion modes grow exponentially@xcite .",
    "however it is not clear that the chiral phase transition is the only mechanism that could produce such a coherent pion excitation .",
    "moreover if there were others ways of generating such a state , then its characteristic distribution of pions could not be regarded as a signal for formation of a quark - gluon plasma . in the present work we examine whether such states can form during the cooling and expansion of hot droplets of quark plasma coupled to chiral fields .    since",
    "a prerequisite for dcc formation is that the system should evolve far from equilibrium , questions of whether a dcc forms and how it evolves can not be addressed in the framework of equilibrium thermodynamics but require either a transport theory or a hydrodynamical approach . techniques for applying qcd directly to such situations do not exist at present . hence most authors who have investigated this subject have worked within the framework of the linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "some of them have made approximations that allow them to construct analytical solutions@xcite .",
    "others have solved the evolution equations for the chiral fields numerically , using a variety of approaches and initial conditions@xcite . of these works on dcc s ,",
    "the only one that , like ours , includes explicit quark degrees of freedom is that of csernai and mishustin@xcite .",
    "those authors studied infinite quark matter undergoing a boost - invariant expansion in one direction .",
    "this allowed them to look for the onset of instability with respect to fluctuations of the chiral fields .",
    "in contrast we study here the full evolution starting from finite - sized droplets of quark matter .",
    "we work within the framework of the linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "this is commonly used as a model for the qcd phase transition because it respects the su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) chiral symmetry of qcd with two light flavours of quark and it contains a scalar field ( @xmath0 ) that has the same chiral properties as the quark condensate . the @xmath0 field can thus be used to represent the order parameter for the chiral phase transition .",
    "moreover it has been argued that the phase transition of the linear sigma model ( without quarks ) should lie in the same universality class as that of qcd@xcite ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless universality does not provide a sufficient justification for the linear sigma model at temperatures that are well below the phase transition or in situations that are far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the use of the model to discuss the possibility of forming a dcc thus remains an act of faith , based on the fact that the model possesses chiral symmetry and contains the most important degrees of freedom at low energies . if it is extended to include quarks ( and if necessary gluons ) , the model can be used to describe the degrees of freedom relevant at high temperatures . at intermediate temperatures",
    "the quarks can also provide a rough model for the effects of massive hadrons ( such as vector mesons and nucleons ) .",
    "an alternative way to include the effects of these particles would be to add terms involving higher derivatives of the chiral fields to the lagrangian , as is done in chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "however we do not expect such contact interactions to provide a good description of the effects of heavy hadrons at the energies of interest for the question of dcc formation and we believe that inclusion of explicit quarks provides more appropriate way to extend the model in this context .    a final comment that we need to make concerns the fact that the quarks in our model are unconfined and can escape to infinity , whereas in a more realistic model they should be converted into hadrons .",
    "we assume here that the hadronisation of the fast - moving quarks occurs well outside the original droplet and so does not affect the subsequent evolution of the chiral fields inside the droplet .",
    "our basic approach is very similar to that of ref.@xcite in that we assume a rapid quench that leaves the quarks out of thermal equilibrium with the chiral fields .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is then described by the classical euler - lagrange equations for the fields coupled to a transport equation for the quarks .",
    "the evolution of the quark density is described by the relativistic transport equation for fermions in the presence of chiral fields which has been derived by shin and rafelski@xcite and zhuang and heinz@xcite ( see also@xcite ) . like the authors of ref.@xcite",
    ", we work in the classical limit where this equation has the form of a relativistic vlasov equation for the distribution of the quarks in phase space .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar quark densities provide source terms in the euler - lagrange equations for the chiral fields .",
    "the classical system of coupled vlasov and field equations is solved using a test - particle method  @xcite .    in using the classical vlasov equation",
    "we are neglecting the nonlocalities that would be present in a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the quarks .",
    "our chiral fields do display strong oscillations in both space and time , but in general they do so in regions where the quark density is small .",
    "hence it is unlikely that serious errors are introduced by the classical treatment of the quarks .",
    "we have further neglected collision terms in the transport equations that could give rise to dissipative effects .",
    "although their inclusion in a transport theory for quarks poses significant problems  @xcite that go beyond the scope of our current investigation , it is important that our approach be extended to include collision terms since these could significantly alter the free streaming of the quarks in our present treatment .",
    "we study here evolution starting from a spherically symmetric droplet of quark plasma within which the quarks are taken to have a uniform density and a thermal momentum distribution at some temperature .",
    "the @xmath0 field inside the droplet is taken to have the value determined self - consistently from the scalar density of these quarks .",
    "we add a small pionic perturbation to this configuration and then examine whether the pion field grows as the system evolves . since our initial conditions do not include a realistic distribution of thermal pions we can not estimate what ratio of coherent to incoherent pions is produced by the decay of such a droplet .",
    "our purpose here is to study whether such a system can generate coherent pions , and if so , by what mechanism .",
    "our results show that the finite size of the system plays a crucial role in determining its behaviour . in our numerical calculations",
    "the quarks rapidly escape from the original region in which they were placed ( _ cf_.@xcite ) .",
    "this leaves the chiral fields in an unstable configuration .",
    "we find that the fields always  roll \" away from this configuration in the @xmath0 direction , that is towards the true vacuum which surrounds the droplet .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of surface effects .",
    "in contrast to the picture suggested on the basis of bulk systems , there is no indication that such a droplet can form a region of more - or - less constant fields corresponding to a misaligned vacuum .",
    "nonetheless we do find that , for large droplets , there can be a coherent amplification of any initial pion field .",
    "these pion fields display strong oscillations in space and time and so the behaviour we find is closer to that in refs.@xcite than that proposed in ref.@xcite .    the mechanism that produces this amplification involves the strong oscillations of the @xmath0 field that pump energy into oscillations of the pion field .",
    "similar behaviour has also been seen in refs.@xcite .",
    "such a system is thus more like a  pion laser \" than the traditional picture of a dcc .",
    "a further difference from a dcc is that a chiral phase transition is not required to produce these enhanced pion fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "a simple model that embodies the main features of qcd associated with chiral symmetry is the linear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "this model respects partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) and includes a scalar field that can model changes in the quark condensate corresponding to restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian for the two - flavour version of this model is @xmath4\\psi + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma   \\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma + \\partial_{\\mu}\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\pi$}\\partial^{\\mu } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\pi$ } ) - u(\\sigma,\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\pi$}),\\ ] ] where @xmath0 and are the scalar meson and pion fields mentioned above .",
    "although colour plays no dynamical role in our calculations , the quark field @xmath5 that we use describes quarks that come in three colours as well as two flavours .",
    "the interactions among the meson fields are described by the potential @xmath6 , which we take to be of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 mev is the pion decay constant and the parameter @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "apart from the final term in @xmath6 the lagrangian is symmetric under su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) chiral symmetry .",
    "the  mexican - hat \" form of this potential leads to spontaneous breaking of this symmetry . in the vacuum",
    "the scalar field has a nonzero expectation value @xmath11 , which corresponds to the quark condensate of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the pions would be massless goldstone bosons if the final term in @xmath6 were not present .",
    "in contrast the scalar mesons have a large mass , related to the coupling @xmath12 by @xmath13    the mass of the @xmath0 meson is often taken to be around 500 mev , since the attractive force between nucleons can be described by exchange of a @xmath0 meson with such a mass . however one should remember that there are important contributions from two - pion exchange in this channel and hence the mass of this  effective \" @xmath0 meson should not be interpreted as the mass of the underlying @xmath14 state .",
    "that state may be better identified with the @xmath15 of the particle data tables@xcite , although au , morgan and pennington@xcite have suggested that this may be part of a much broader structure in @xmath16 scattering at around 1000 mev . for most of our work",
    "we have taken @xmath17 mev , but we have also considered values in the range 6001000 mev .",
    "the quark - meson coupling constant @xmath18 is more conveniently specified in terms of the dynamical mass of the quarks in the vacuum with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , @xmath19 the values for @xmath20 that we use lie between 300 and 500 mev , corresponding to @xmath21",
    ".    in our studies we consider configurations in which only one component of the pion field is nonvanishing . as a further simplification in our numerical work we neglect the isospin dependence of the quark - pion coupling .",
    "in fact this coupling is unimportant for the systems we consider because the quark density is close to zero by the time that the pion field becomes important . in practice",
    "therefore we are working with the simplified lagrangian @xmath22\\psi   + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma   + \\partial_{\\mu}\\pi\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi ) - u(\\sigma,\\pi),\\ ] ] in which the meson fields of an o(2 ) linear sigma model are coupled to two flavours of quark .",
    "the extension of our approach to the o(4 ) case is straightforward .      as in the treatment of csernai and mishustin@xcite",
    ", we assume that the expanding droplet of quark matter undergoes a rapid quench which leaves the quarks out of equilibrium with the chiral fields .",

    "we impose the boundary condition that the pion field vanishes while the @xmath0 field is set equal to @xmath59 .",

    "this shows that very little further energy is radiated in these modes after 8 fm/@xmath61 .",
    "similarly the total number of pions , calculated using ( [ npi ] ) and plotted in fig .",
    "7 , shows very little change after this time . in this case",
    "the number of pions produced is 20 times larger than the number corresponding to the initial pionic perturbation .    another related way to study the pionic modes",
    "is provided by the fourier transform of the correlation function , whose time dependence was plotted by the authors of refs .",
    "this quantity is equal to @xmath138 and so can be thought of as the second term of ( [ epi ] ) divided by @xmath139 .",
    "once the pion field is in the regime where it satisfies a linear equation and oscillates harmonically , @xmath138 oscillates with frequency @xmath140 .",
    "these oscillations are smoothed out in  ( [ epi ] ) by the presence of the time - derivative term .",
    "although we do not present results for the correlation function here , we have looked at it to check that the enhanced modes shown in fig .",
    "6 do indeed show the expected oscillations for radiated pions which are in the harmonic regime .",
    "the small remaining oscillations of the pion field in the central region that can be seen at times after 8 fm/@xmath61 in fig .  2 do not contribute significantly to the pion radiation .",
    "this can also be seen from the behaviour of the total number of pions in fig .",
    "7 .    to explore the robustness of this mechanism for generating enhanced pion fields we have considered other initial conditions .",
    "these include examples with nonzero baryon density ( @xmath141 ) or expanding initial droplets ( @xmath142 in eqs .",
    "( [ sigv0],[piv0 ] ) ) and initial pionic perturbations with different magnitudes or spatial extents . in all these cases we obtained results that are qualitatively similar to those shown here .",
    "they are also qualitatively the same if we work in the chiral limit with massless pions .",
    "our results are however sensitive to other parameters of the model . in particular smaller @xmath0 masses",
    "correspond to smaller initial energy densities for the chiral fields .",
    "for example , with @xmath90 mev a droplet of radius 4 fm leads to much less amplification than the case shown in figs .",
    "the effect of taking a larger quark - meson coupling is discussed below .",
    "all of the cases discussed so far correspond to evolution starting from the phase with restored ( approximate ) chiral symmetry .",
    "one can also ask about evolution from an initial state where chiral symmetry is already spontaneously broken .",
    "for this purpose we have considered initial conditions where the temperature is @xmath143 mev ( @xmath144 ) but with other parameters as above . in this case ,",
    "the initial hot quarks are `` dressed '' and have a dynamical mass of @xmath145 mev where @xmath82 is the nontrivial solution of ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "we take the radius of the initial droplet and the initial pionic perturbation to be the same as in the previous example .",
    "the time evolution of the fields at several radii are shown in fig .  8 for this case .",
    "the qualitative behaviour is similar to that of the example with @xmath146 shown in fig .  2 .",
    "again we see that @xmath0 field oscillates strongly although for a rather shorter period : in this case 46 fm/@xmath61 . during these oscillations",
    "there is a significant amplification of the pion field .",
    "this shows that there is nothing about this mechanism for generating a coherent pion field that requires a phase transition .",
    "what is essential is that the initial chiral fields have sufficient energy .",
    "csernai and mishustin@xcite have used the same model to study the simpler case of infinite quark matter undergoing a boost - invariant expansion in one direction .",
    "they found a similar coherent amplification of the pion field .",
    "in addition they pointed out that a more complete treatment of the model would be expected to lead to formation of clusters of quarks and antiquarks surrounded by domains of the coherent chiral fields . in the cases discussed above",
    "we did not find any such clusters ( _ cf_. fig .",
    "however if we increase the strength of the quark - meson coupling we do obtain such behaviour .",
    "this can be illustrated by the parameter set @xmath147 mev ( @xmath148 ) and @xmath149  gev , in the chiral limit . in this case symmetry restoration",
    "occurs at @xmath150 mev .",
    "we consider a droplet of radius @xmath151 fm , with initial temperature @xmath152 mev and chemical potential @xmath153 mev . in fig .",
    "9 we show the radial dependence of the density of quarks and antiquarks times @xmath123 at successive times .",
    "in contrast to the case shown in fig .  4 , the quarks with smaller momenta are reflected from the surface region at around 3 fm and remain trapped within the droplet .",
    "the behaviour of the chiral fields shown in fig .",
    "10 is quite different from the previous examples .",
    "the @xmath0 field in the central region continues to oscillate wildly around values that are much less than @xmath93 .",
    "the quark cluster is obviously created in a highly excited configuration and as it settles down a significant fraction of its excitation energy is radiated in the form of pions , as can be seen from the fact that very large amplitude oscillations of the pion field continue for times up to 20 fm/@xmath61 ( and well beyond ) . in this particular example",
    "the quarks are left in a shell - like distribution with a radius @xmath154 fm , which is basically a  slac bag \" soliton@xcite .",
    "other initial conditions that we have studied lead to more uniform distributions of quarks trapped inside shallow  bags \" in the @xmath0 field . in all cases",
    "the resulting excited quark clusters form efficient radiators of coherent pions .",
    "we have investigated the expansion of hot droplets of quark plasma coupled to the sigma and the pion fields of the linear sigma model , addressing in particular the question of whether such droplets can lead to the production of a coherent classical pion field or a disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the formation of a dcc could be used a signal for the chiral phase transition in high - energy nucleus - nucleus or hadron collisions@xcite .",
    "we have therefore examined whether the phase transition is the only mechanism that could produce a coherent pion  field .",
    "we treat the evolution of the system classically and solve numerically the vlasov equation for the quarks coupled to the nonlinear klein - gordon equations for the chiral fields .",
    "these equations have previously been studied by csernai and mishustin@xcite , but only for the case of infinite quark matter undergoing a boost - invariant expansion .",
    "our results show that finite - size effects play an important role in the evolution of such systems .",
    "our starting point is a spherical droplet containing a uniform density of quarks and antiquarks in thermal equilibrium at some temperature @xmath155 . inside this region",
    "the sigma field is taken to be constant . in using this type of initial configuration",
    "we are assuming a rapid quench that leaves the quarks out of thermal equilibrium with the meson fields .",
    "we add to this a small pionic perturbation , to act as a `` seed '' for possible formation of a coherent pion field .",
    "the fluctuations of the initial meson fields away from their self - consistent values ought to be taken from a thermal distribution . we plan to do this in future work using an extension of the method proposed by randrup@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have used a uniform initial perturbation in order to study whether such droplets can lead to amplification of a coherent pion field .",
    "we find that the quarks rapidly escape from the original region in which they were placed , as in ref.@xcite .",
    "this leaves the chiral fields in an unstable configuration . starting from the surface of the droplet ,",
    "the chiral fields relax towards the physical vacuum which surrounds the droplet ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the behaviour is rather different from the picture which has been suggested on the basis of a uniform system , namely , that the symmetry of the potential could allow different regions to relax towards vacuum configurations with different chiral orientations . in the finite systems that we have studied ,",
    "the surface effects ensure that the fields always `` roll '' away from their unstable initial configuration towards the physical vacuum .",
    "the departure of the quarks leaves the @xmath0 field in a configuration with significant potential energy . as a result it undergoes rather violent oscillations , during which this energy is radiated in the form of meson waves , before settling down to its vacuum value .",
    "if an initial pion field is present then some of this energy can be converted into pions .",
    "this leads to a coherent production of pions with a particular isospin and so would have similar observable effects to a dcc .",
    "however unlike the picture of a dcc consisting regions of differently oriented vacuum , the pion fields oscillate strongly in space and time .",
    "hence the behaviour we find is closer to that in refs .",
    "@xcite than that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for large initial droplets that start in the chirally restored phase",
    ", we find significant amplification of the number of pions , typically by factors of the order of 20 or more .",
    "the mechanism is robust against changes in the initial conditions as described in sec .",
    "[ res ] .    in some cases",
    "we find that the pion oscillations contain a strong component with half the frequency of the @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "similar oscillations of pion fields driven by the @xmath0 field have also been seen in the homogeneous systems of @xmath0 and pion fields ( without quarks ) studied by boyanovsky _",
    "et al._@xcite and mrowczynski and mller@xcite .",
    "analogous behaviour is also seen in models of inflationary universes where an additional scalar field is coupled to the field that drives the inflation@xcite .",
    "mathematically one can describe this as a parametric resonance driven by the oscillations of the @xmath0-dependent mass term in the pion field equation .",
    "more physically one can view it as a  pion laser \" where energy is pumped into the pion field by the process @xmath157 .",
    "the larger the initial energy in the @xmath0 field , the more effectively this mechanism operates .",
    "hence we find the greatest amplification for the largest droplets , in cases with the largest @xmath0 mass .",
    "smaller droplets , with radii less than 2 fm , do not lead to significant pion production . also the enhancement factors are much smaller for cases with @xmath90 mev compared to those where we took @xmath17 mev .    if the quark - meson coupling is taken to be strong enough , then some of the quarks remain trapped inside the droplet and eventually form a cold multiquark cluster , as suggested by csernai and mishustin@xcite .",
    "these clusters are produced in highly excited configurations that can act as extremely efficient radiators of coherent pions .",
    "however one should remember that the cold quark matter of the linear sigma model is not expected to be a very good approximation to hadronic matter . hence one should not take this version of the mechanism for coherent pion production too seriously before more realistic models have been explored .",
    "the nature of the mechanism for the enhancement of the pion field found in our work makes no obvious reference to the chiral phase transition . as explained in sec .",
    "[ ics ] the model possesses a temperature @xmath92 below which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this enables us to study evolution from states in which the symmetry is partially restored , that is , where the temperature , although less than @xmath92 , is still high enough that the @xmath0 field is significantly reduced from its vacuum value .",
    "the matter in these states consists of dressed quarks with finite dynamical masses , and can be though of as a crude model for hot hadronic matter in which hadrons with higher masses than pions are present .",
    "we find that large enough droplets with initial temperatures below @xmath92 , behave in a similar way to ones with initially restored chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular they also lead to amplification of coherent pions .",
    "this is a further indication that the mechanism involved is that of a",
    " pion laser \" which is driven by the oscillating @xmath0 field and which does not rely on the phase transition for its operation .    like the dcc s and other coherent pion fields discussed in the literature",
    ", the pions produced by this mechanism will have the same characteristic @xmath158 distribution for the fraction @xmath159 of neutral pions .",
    "however to determine whether this signal will be experimentally observable over the background of incoherently produced pions we need to know the actual number of coherent pions .",
    "this will require the use of more realistic inital conditions .",
    "in particular , as already mentioned , we need to take the initial pionic fluctuations from a thermal distribution . for this purpose",
    "we will need to extend the method described in@xcite to our model which has explicit quark degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition we are studying other geometries since , especially for ultrarelativistic collisions , a cylindrical system undergoing a boost - invariant expansion is expected to be more relevant than a spherical one .",
    "finally we should also point out the need to extend our approach to include both quantum effects and collision terms in the transport equations .",
