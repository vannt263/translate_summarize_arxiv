    "an optical isolator ( optical diode ) is an optical component that allow the light to pass in one direction but block it in the opposite direction .",
    "these devices are commonly used in laser technology to prevent the unwanted backreflections which might be harmful to optical instrumentation .",
    "the standard optical isolator , as first proposed by rayleigh @xcite , is composed of two polarizers with their transmission axes rotated by @xmath0 with respect to each other and a faraday rotator .",
    "the faraday rotator is made of a magnetoactive medium which is placed inside a strong magnet .",
    "the magnetic field induces a circular anisotropy in the material ( faraday effect ) , which makes the left and right circular polarizations experience a different refraction index . as a result , the plane of linear polarization travelling through the device is rotated by an angle equal to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the induction of the applied magnetic field , @xmath3 is a length of the magnetoactive medium and @xmath4 is the verdet material constant . because the verdet constant depends strongly on the wavelength ,",
    "so does the rotation angle of the rotator .",
    "the standard optical diode shown in works as follows .",
    "the light travelling in the forward direction is first linearly polarized in the horizontal direction by the input polarizer .",
    "afterwards , the faraday element rotates the polarization by @xmath5 and finally , the light is transmitted through the output polarizer .",
    "the light travelling backwards is first linearly polarized at @xmath5 , the faraday rotator then rotates the polarization by another @xmath5 , meaning the light is now polarized in the vertical direction . because the input polarizer transmits only horizontal polarization , the light is extinguished .",
    "the main drawback of standard isolators is that they work efficiently only for a very narrow range of wavelengths , because of the dispersion of the faraday rotation angle @xmath6 .     by the faraday rotator and",
    "passes through the output polarizer .",
    "the light travelling backwards is first polarized at @xmath5 , then it is rotated by another @xmath5 in the faraday element .",
    "the resulting horizontal polarization is extinguished by the input vertical polarizer . ]",
    "the usual approach seen in commercial broadband isolators is to add the additional reciprocal rotator ( e.g. quartz rotator ) next to the faraday rotator .",
    "the former element is used to compensate for the dispersion of the faraday rotator @xcite . in the forward direction ,",
    "the rotation of the two elements add up to a total rotation of @xmath7 , whereas in the opposite direction the rotations subtract and no rotation is experienced by the plane of linear polarization .",
    "recently we proposed a novel broadband isolator @xcite , which could be realized with the bulk optics elements .",
    "we exploited the analogy in the mathematical description of a quantum two - state system driven by a pulsed laser field and an electromagnetic wave propagating through an anisotropic medium .",
    "the technique of composite pulses known from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and quantum optics @xcite was applied by us to find conditions for broadband operation of the isolator .    in this article",
    ", we propose an alternative realization of the optical isolator which could be suitably implemented in fibre optics .",
    "our approach is based on the adiabatic evolution of the stokes vector @xcite which allows for a broadband performance of the presented isolator .",
    "as high - power fibre lasers are attracting an increasing attention , the development of integrated optical elements for the manipulation of the state of light becomes a crucial point .",
    "an all - fibre architecture has the advantage of allowing for an efficient transmission of light without reflections losses on the way ( except from an input to a fibre ) ; such losses are a serious problem in bulk optics . as the broadband",
    "high - power sources like superluminescent diodes ( sld ) or ti : sapphire oscillators are broadly used in optical coherence tomography ( oct ) @xcite , characterization of optical components @xcite and optical measurements @xcite , the issue of the efficient broadband isolation in fibres is of increasing importance .",
    "the composition of the manuscript is the following . in section [ stokes ]",
    "we present the mathematical description underpinning our approach .",
    "section [ design ] discusses the design of our broadband optical isolator .",
    "then we consider the practical realization of the proposed design in section [ practical ] .",
    "section [ results ] presents the performance of the diode and in the last section [ conclusion ] we summarize the conclusions .",
    "consider the propagation of a plane electromagnetic wave through an anisotropic dielectric medium along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "we assume that there are no polarization dependent losses .",
    "then the equation of motion is given by the torque equation macmaster1961 , schmieder1969 , kubo1980 , kubo1983 , kubo1985 @xmath9where @xmath10 $ ] is the stokes polarization vector representing any state of polarization on the poincar sphere , and @xmath11 $ ] is a birefringence vector of the medium .",
    "one can write down in matrix form as@xmath12where the matrix @xmath13 is given as @xmath14 \\,.\\]]we shall make use of the adiabatic evolution of the stokes vector . for this purpose ,",
    "we need the eigenvalues of @xmath13 , which read@xmath15with @xmath16 .",
    "the eigenvector that corresponds to the zero eigenvalue is extremely simple : @xmath17we will call this eigenvector  polarization dark state \" in analogy to the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) process in quantum optics gaubatz1990,bergmann1998,bergmann2001 . assuming that the evolution is adiabatic and that the stokes polarization vector @xmath18 is initially aligned with the polarization  dark state \" @xmath19 , then the stokes vector will follow this adiabatic state throughout the medium . the evolution of the polarization ",
    "dark state \" depends on the initial polarization and the spatial ordering of the components of birefringence vector .",
    "it will be discussed in detail in the next section .    in analogy to the quantum - optical stirap @xcite",
    "the condition for adiabatic evolution requires the integral of the length of birefringence vector over the propagation distance @xmath3 to be large , i.e. @xmath20",
    "the optical isolator we are going to present requires two crossed polarizers and two achromatic optical elements : a reciprocal ( standard ) quarter wave plate and a non - reciprocal quarter wave plate . below we will describe the design in the framework of formalism presented above .",
    "let us first analyze the operation of the achromatic reciprocal quarter wave - plate .",
    "this problem was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the reciprocity of the wave plate comes from the reciprocity of the birefringence vector .",
    "this means that when the light travels through the wave plate in the reverse direction , the sign of the birefringence vector is also reversed .    bearing this in mind",
    ", we analyze the evolution of the polarization dark state .",
    "let us assume that initially the light is linearly polarized in the horizontal direction , @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath22 precedes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the stokes vector smoothly follows the birefringence vector , the polarization ends up in the right circular polarization state @xmath25 $ ] , provided that only @xmath26 is present at the end ( e.g. through a large spin rate of the fibre @xcite ) .",
    "the process is fully reversible , meaning that if we change the ordering of the birefringence vector components ( @xmath24 now precedes @xmath22 and @xmath27 ) , and the stokes vector is initially aligned along @xmath28-axis , it adiabatically evolves into state @xmath29 $ ] ( horizontal linear polarization ) .",
    "the latter holds if only @xmath30 is present at the end .",
    "thus , this arrangement operates as the standard quarter wave plate .",
    "the second case of the non - reciprocal quarter wave plate requires the use of a non - reciprocal birefringent element , which would be sensitive to the direction of propagation of light .",
    "it is long known that the magnetic field applied to a magnetoactive medium induces a circular birefringence which makes the left and right circularly polarized light experience different refractive indices resulting in rotation of the plane of linear polarization .    in the forward direction",
    "the operation of the element with one of the birefringence components being non - reciprocal is the same as for a reciprocal one : the light initially polarized horizontally @xmath31 $ ] is transformed into the right circular polarization state @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "however , the propagation in the reverse direction is different .",
    "if we start with the right circular polarization @xmath33 $ ] it evolves into the linear _ vertical _ polarization @xmath34 $ ] ( see ) .",
    "the design of the broadband optical isolator described in section design could be conveniently implemented with single - mode optical fibre .",
    "the use of fibre - optic isolator is exceedingly attractive for integrated fibre - optic systems as well as high power applications .",
    "the single - mode fibre has to exhibit both linear and circular birefringence .",
    "the first one might be induced by stress applied to a fibre or by external electric field kundikova1997 , fernandes2012 . to induce the circular birefringence",
    "one might apply a torsion of the fibre ( for the reciprocal effect ) or the external magnetic field ( through the faraday non - reciprocal effect ) .",
    "the possible implementation is depicted in .",
    "the achromatic wave - plate described in section [ reciprocal ] would be implemented in the single - mode fibre with the combined stress - induced linear birefringence and torsion of the fibre which would generate a circular birefringence .",
    "the choice of torsion - induced circular birefringence is dictated by the requirement that this part of our setup must be reversible .",
    "the first author that experimentally demonstrated the achromatic and adiabatic quarter - wave plate was huang @xcite .",
    "he used a spun fibre with the spinning rate increased with the distance .",
    "those reciprocal designs allowed for the transformation of polarization from linear to circular and back . the reciprocal achromatic quarter - wave plate could be alternatively realized with commercially available achromatic quarter - wave plate .    the non - reciprocal achromatic quarter wave plate can be made similarly to the reciprocal one .",
    "the only difference is that one has to use circular birefringence which would be non - reciprocal with respect to the direction of propagation of light .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the magnetic field generates such birefringence through the faraday effect .",
    "similarly to the faraday rotator in the standard isolator , this element is crucial for the design of the practical optical diode .",
    "the problem with the faraday effect in standard silica fibres is that the verdet constant of the medium is very low @xcite and , thus , one needs a very long piece of fibre or very strong magnetic field to achieve a significant rotation .",
    "many different approaches has been devised to overcome this difficulty .",
    "it seems that the most successful is the doping of fibre with rare - earth ions like terbium ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the value of verdet constant achievable with these fibres @xcite is nearly as high as that of the bulk optics rotators made of terbium gallium garnet ( tgg ) @xcite .",
    "m ( black solid line ) , @xmath36  m ( red dashed line ) and @xmath37  m ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "we plotted ( a ) the transmission of the isolator ( intensity transmitted in the forward direction ) , and ( b ) the isolation of the optical diode , versus wavelength . ]",
    "m ( black solid line ) , @xmath36  m ( red dashed line ) and @xmath37  m ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "we plotted ( a ) the transmission of the isolator ( intensity transmitted in the forward direction ) , and ( b ) the isolation of the optical diode , versus wavelength . ]",
    "we performed numerical simulations of the performance of the design we described in this manuscript . in our calculation",
    "we assumed the stress - induced birefringence equal to @xmath38 which is easily achievable with the existing technology @xcite .",
    "the linear birefringence component of the birefringence vector is then given by the equation @xmath39 where @xmath3 is the length of the proposed in - fibre isolator .    as mentioned",
    "before , the verdet constant of the standard silica fibre is very low .",
    "thus , we decided to consider the silica fibre doped with paramagnetic terbium ions .",
    "the dispersion of such fibre is similar to a bulk optics tgg crystal @xcite @xmath40 with slightly different fit parameters @xmath41(nm@xmath42  rad)/(t@xmath43 m ) and @xmath44  nm @xcite .",
    "the circular component of the birefringence vector now reads @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the amplitude of the magnetic field induction .",
    "we assumed the magnitude of the magnetic field to be @xmath47  t. simulations were carried out for three different lengths : @xmath48  m , @xmath49  m and @xmath37  m.    the choice of optically active medium ( tgg ) roughly defines the wavelength range of presented optical isolator .",
    "transmission window of terbium doped fibre ( 500 - 1000  nm ) and the magnitude of faraday rotation constitutes the range of operation of isolator simulated in this section .",
    "such isolator would be suitable in experiments with ti : sapphire laser ( central wavelength at 780  nm ) . to achieve a similar performance in a different wavelength range",
    "requires a different choice of paramagnetic ions , which would induce a faraday rotation of significant amplitude . for",
    "a telecommunication wavelengths bismuth rare - earth ions might be an appropriate choice . the other issue that must be taken into account is a single - mode performance of fibre .",
    "the higher order modes induced in a fibre might negatively affect the performance of isolator .",
    "such fibre must be adjusted to a wavelength window in which the isolator is expected to operate .",
    "the commercial manufacturers provide a wide range of such fibres @xcite .",
    "we quantify the performance of the designed isolator with its transmission and isolation .",
    "transmission indicates the intensity of light passing through the isolator as compared to the intensity at the input . in the forward direction we have @xmath50 in the backward direction @xmath51 where @xmath52 represent the stokes vector of light travelling forwards , @xmath53  for light travelling backwards , @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] refer to the input horizontal and output vertical polarizers , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 is the intensity of light entering the isolator , whereas @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the intensities measured after the diode in the forward and backward directions .",
    "the isolation was calculated using the standard formula @xcite @xmath59    depicts the results of our calculations for the three fibre lengths . in  a we presented the intensity of light in the forward direction and in  b the isolation .",
    "one can notice the exceptionally high level of isolation over the whole range of wavelengths considered .",
    "what is interesting , the level of isolation is almost constant irrespective of the length of the isolator .",
    "the price we have to pay for broadband isolation is the transmission window decreasing with decreasing length of the isolator .",
    "as the length of the setup decreases the adiabatic condition is weakened and , thus , the transmission becomes worse .",
    "the transmission was calculated with an assumption that the fibre is lossless . in practice , the light travelling through a fibre",
    "is attenuated .",
    "however , because the length of our isolator is relatively short , the losses should be negligible .",
    "the isolation of the best commercial broadband fibre diodes @xcite is no greater than 32  db and the range of isolation is around 150  nm .",
    "as seen in  b , the isolation of our diode remains greater than 70  db for a range as wide as 500  nm .",
    "because of the robustness of adiabatic techniques , the isolation would be also insensitive to variations in the temperature and the length of the fibre .",
    "in this manuscript we proposed a novel design of the fibre optical isolator , which operates over a broad range of wavelengths .",
    "the adiabatic evolution has been successfully applied to obtain a robust broadband performance of the optical diode under study .",
    "the isolator can be further enhanced by inducing birefringence of higher magnitude .",
    "this is possible with stress - induced birefringence , as in our simulations we used a moderate value of the former . to obtain higher circular birefringence with the faraday effect",
    "one can apply stronger magnetic field or use a different magnetoactive medium to assure higher value of the verdet constant .",
    "increasing the value of birefringence would also result in the decrease of the length of the device .",
