    "the purpose of this article is to initiate a systematic study of integrable and superintegrable systems in the presence of a magnetic field in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath5 , both in classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "we recall that a classical hamiltonian system with @xmath6 degrees of freedom is ( liouville ) integrable if it allows @xmath6 integrals of motion @xmath7 including the hamiltonian",
    ". they must be in involution , be well defined functions on phase space and be functionally independent .",
    "the system is superintegrable if further integrals @xmath8 exist with @xmath9",
    ". they must also be well - defined functions on phase space , the set @xmath10 must be functionally independent , however the integrals @xmath8 need not be in involution with @xmath11 nor with each other . on the contrary , the set of all integrals generates a non - abelian algebra under poisson commutation . in quantum mechanics",
    "the definitions must be modified .",
    "the integrals @xmath7 will be well - defined operators in the enveloping algebra of the heisenberg lie algebra , i.e. polynomials in the coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or more general objects , such as convergent series in these objects . instead of functional independence",
    "we shall require polynomial independence .",
    "in other words no nontrivial fully symmetrized polynomial ( jordan polynomial ) in the integrals of motion should vanish .",
    "the best known superintegrable systems in @xmath14 @xmath15 are the coulomb - kepler system and the isotropic harmonic oscillator with their @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetry algebras , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it follows from bertrand s theorem @xcite that these are the only spherically symmetric maximally superintegrable systems in @xmath5 ( and actually in @xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "most of the recent research on superintegrability concentrated on `` natural '' hamiltonians with scalar potentials .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite . for early systematic work on superintegrability in @xmath18",
    "see  @xcite and in @xmath5  @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "earlier work on integrability with magnetic fields ( velocity dependent potentials ) mainly concerned the two - dimensional case @xcite with notable exceptions @xcite .",
    "a particle moving under the influence of a static electromagnetic field is described by the classical hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 are components of the linear momentum , @xmath21 the spatial coordinates , the vector and electrostatic potential @xmath0 , @xmath1 are functions only of the coordinates @xmath22 and we choose the units in which the mass of the particle has the numerical value @xmath23 and the charge of the particle is @xmath24 ( having an electron in mind as the prime example ) .",
    "we recall that the equations of motion of the hamiltonian  ( [ classham ] ) are gauge invariant , i.e. that they are the same for the potentials @xmath25 for any choice of the function @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the physically relevant quantity is the magnetic field @xmath27 rather than the vector potential @xmath0 ( where @xmath28 is the completely antisymmetric tensor with @xmath29 ) .",
    "we shall also consider the quantum hamiltonian defined as the properly symmetrized analogue of ( [ classham ] ) in terms of the operators of the linear momenta @xmath30 and coordinates @xmath31 : @xmath32 the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 act on wavefunctions as multiplication by the functions @xmath35 and @xmath1 , respectively .    on the quantum level , the gauge transformation  ( [ classgaugeequiv ] ) demonstrates itself as a unitary transformation of the hilbert space .",
    "namely , let us take @xmath36 applying ( [ quantumgauge ] ) on the states and the observables we get an equivalent description of the same physical reality in terms of @xmath37 in particular , the following observables transform covariantly @xmath38 we recall that the quantum dynamics may not depend only on the magnetic field @xmath39 . in nontrivial topologies of the configuration space ,",
    "e.g. when singularities are present in the potential , not all vector potentials @xmath40 inducing the same magnetic field @xmath39 are gauge equivalent , as the observable aharonov - bohm effect demonstrates  @xcite .",
    "let us consider integrals of motion which are at most second order in the momenta . because our system is gauge invariant  ( [ classgaugeequiv ] ) ,  ( [ covarpa ] ) we find it convenient to express the integrals in terms of gauge covariant expressions @xmath41 rather than the momenta themselves .",
    "the operators ( [ covarp ] ) do not commute amongst each other .",
    "they satisfy @xmath42=-{\\mathrm{i}}\\hbar \\epsilon_{jkl } \\hat b_l , \\qquad [ \\hat p_j^a,\\hat x_k]=-{\\mathrm{i}}\\hbar \\delta_{jk}\\ ] ] and analogous relations for poisson brackets in classical mechanics .",
    "classically , we write a general second order integral of motion as @xmath43 we define the poisson bracket in the standard manner @xmath44 the condition that the poisson bracket of the integral ( [ classint ] ) with the hamiltonian  ( [ classham ] ) vanishes @xmath45 leads to terms of order @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the momenta and respectively to the following equations : + third order @xmath48 second order @xmath49 it follows that we have @xmath50 first order @xmath51 zero order @xmath52    equations  ( [ hoconds ] ) are the same as for the system with vanishing magnetic field and their explicit solution is known .",
    "they imply that the highest order terms in the integral ( [ classint ] ) are linear combinations of products of the generators of the euclidean group @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( up to a redefinition of lower order terms ) . when expressed explicitly in terms of the covariant expressions  ( [ covarp ] ) , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the functions @xmath59 are expressed in terms of the constants @xmath60 as follows @xmath61 since we have the relation @xmath62 one of the parameters @xmath63 is irrelevant and can be set equal to any chosen value .",
    "however that explicitly breaks the symmetry of our equations ; thus we prefer to keep all parameters @xmath63 in our formulas and we use  ( [ pl0 ] ) as a constraint .",
    "the conditions  ( [ 2ordcond ] ) allow us to express all the second order derivatives of @xmath64 explicitly in terms of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath39 and their derivatives @xmath67 taking various first and second order derivatives of these expressions and comparing them , e.g. @xmath68 we arrive at compatibility conditions for @xmath59 and @xmath39 .",
    "altogether there are 6 independent second order pdes relating them which can be solved e.g. for @xmath69 but they are too cumbersome to reproduce here",
    ".    in the quantum case we have to consider a properly symmetrized analogue of  ( [ classint ] ) .",
    "we choose the following convention @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the symmetrization @xmath72 and @xmath73 are to be interpreted as the corresponding operators of multiplication by the given function .",
    "all possible choices of symmetrization are equivalent up to redefinition of the lower order terms .    imposing the condition that the integral of motion in the form  ( [ quantint ] ) commutes with the hamiltonian  ( [ quantham ] ) we obtain a similar set of conditions as above .",
    "in particular , the conditions  ( [ hoconds ] ) remain the same , i.e. their solution has the same form  ( [ eucluea ] )",
    ". the conditions  ( [ 2ordcond ] ) get apparent quantum corrections @xmath74 due to the explicit solution  ( [ eucluea ] ) we have @xmath75 i.e. these apparent quantum corrections vanish and equations  ( [ 2ordcondkvant ] ) and  ( [ 2ordcond ] ) are the same .",
    "similarly , in the quantum version of equations  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) we obtain some extra terms but they vanish once the solution  ( [ eucluea ] ) of equations  ( [ hoconds ] ) is substituted in , i.e. also the conditions  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) remain in the quantum case .",
    "the situation is however different for the last equation  ( [ 0ordcond ] ) which does obtain @xmath76proportional corrections . using equations ( [ hoconds ] ) , ( [ 2ordcond ] ) , ( [ 1ordcond ] ) and their differential consequences we find @xmath77 notice that the last line seems to violate the obvious symmetry of our problem under euclidean transformations .",
    "however , this is not the case in view of the identity @xmath78 which is a consequence of @xmath79    notice that for the special case of first order integrals the conditions ( [ hoconds])([0ordcond ] ) become significantly simpler .",
    "namely , the conditions ( [ hoconds ] ) do not arise .",
    "the right hand sides of the conditions ( [ 2ordcond ] ) vanish and thus equations ( [ 2ordcond ] ) imply that the first order term @xmath80 in the integral is a constant linear combination of the covariant linear and angular momenta @xmath81 ( see  ( [ covarp ] ) , ( [ covarl ] ) ) .",
    "the conditions  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) simplify to @xmath82 and imply first order compatibility conditions relating @xmath39 and @xmath64 @xmath83 the condition  ( [ 0ordcond ] ) remains the same as for the second order integral . in this case",
    "it gets no quantum correction , i.e. ( [ 0ordcond ] ) and ( [ 0ordcondquant ] ) now coincide .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the situation where the hamiltonian  ( [ classham ] ) or  ( [ quantham ] ) is integrable in the liouville sense , with at most quadratic integrals .",
    "that means that in addition to the hamiltonian itself there must be at least two independent integrals of motion of the form  ( [ classint ] ) or ( [ quantint ] ) which commute in the sense of the poisson bracket or lie commutator , respectively .",
    "independence is to be understood as functional independence in the classical situation and in the sense that no nontrivial fully symmetrized polynomial in the given operators vanishes in the quantum case .",
    "since the highest order conditions  ( [ hoconds ] ) are the same whether or not there is a magnetic field present , the first step of the analysis can be performed as in @xcite , leading to 11 nonequivalent possibilities for the functions @xmath59 .",
    "next one should look into equations  ( [ 2ordcond ] ) , ( [ 1ordcond ] ) , ( [ 0ordcond ] ) ( resp .",
    "( [ 0ordcondquant ] ) ) and their consequences to determine the nonequivalent possible choices of the magnetic field @xmath84 and the electrostatic potential @xmath1 .",
    "this is the approach used by a. zhalij in @xcite for the special case of the integrals @xmath85    we shall follow a different route here . keeping in mind that our main goal is to arrive at examples of superintegrable systems with nonvanishing magnetic field",
    "we shall assume that the integrability arises in the simplest way possible .",
    "namely , we assume that there are at least two independent first order integrals for our hamiltonian .",
    "assuming that we have @xmath86 ( or its quantum analogue ) we may use the euclidean transformations to simplify @xmath87 .",
    "another allowed transformation is replacing @xmath87 by an arbitrary regular linear combination , @xmath88 for convenience , we redefine the yet unknown functions @xmath89 as needed without renaming them .",
    "we arrive at the following possibilities    * if we have @xmath90 then we can set @xmath91 and @xmath92 by rotation and linear combination to @xmath93 * if @xmath94 we can transform e.g. @xmath91 by rotation and translation into @xmath95 . *",
    "* assuming that the integrability arises directly at the first order , i.e. that @xmath96 , we arrive at a single possibility @xmath97 * * however , there is another option - to allow @xmath91 and @xmath92 to be not in involution and expect the second commuting integral to arise via poisson brackets and polynomial combinations of @xmath87 .",
    "thus we may up to rotation and linear combination take @xmath98 in order to have nontrivial dynamics , i.e. nontrivial electric and/or magnetic field , we can not have the full euclidean algebra represented in terms of the integrals of motion .",
    "thus we must require that the algebra generated by the highest order terms @xmath99 and @xmath100 in  ( [ x1x2noncomm ] ) via poisson brackets closes as a proper subalgebra of the euclidean algebra .",
    "we have the following options : 1 .   the algebra isomorphic to @xmath101 @xmath102 2 .",
    "the algebra isomorphic to the euclidean algebra @xmath103 @xmath104 this case is , however , already included in  ( [ p1p2 ] ) as a special subcase .",
    "let us start our detailed investigation by considering the case of the integrals  ( [ p1p2 ] ) @xmath106 the condition that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are in involution is equivalent to @xmath107 equations  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) reduce to @xmath108 and together with  ( [ p1p2b3 ] ) imply that @xmath109 writing the components of the magnetic field as @xmath110 we have @xmath111 we choose a suitable vector potential in the form ( satisfying the coulomb gauge condition @xmath112 ) @xmath113 and from the conditions  ( [ 0ordcond ] ) we find that @xmath114 plugging all the information obtained about functions @xmath115 into the assumed form of the integrals  ( [ p1p2 ] ) we find a very simple solution ( unique up to the choice of gauge ) @xmath116 the same result arises also in the quantum case , via essentially the same arguments .",
    "let us now assume that our system  ( [ classham ] ) with the potentials @xmath117 is superintegrable , i.e. that an additional independent integral of motion exists . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that it is of first order in momenta .",
    "up to addition of @xmath91 and @xmath92 we have @xmath118 we consider equations  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) and their compatibility conditions which take the form @xmath119 we arrive at two distinct possibilities :    * if @xmath120 then @xmath121 , i.e. the magnetic field  ( [ p1p2b ] ) is constant .",
    "this case has already been well studied in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite . solving equations  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) and ( [ 0ordcond ] )",
    "we find that the electrostatic potential is constant too , i.e. we have a motion in constant magnetic field and no electric field .",
    "this system is superintegrable and exactly solvable as follows . without loss of generality",
    "we can rotate the coordinate system so that we have @xmath122 four independent first order integrals exist in this case .",
    "we write them down in the classical situation , quantum mechanically they are the same expressions in terms of operators .",
    "they read @xmath123 the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of @xmath124 as @xmath125 the classical equations of motion @xmath126 are solved explicitly as @xmath127 where @xmath128 are the initial coordinates and @xmath129 the initial momenta . from  ( [ constbsoln ] )",
    "we find that the trajectory is a helix with axis parallel to the @xmath130axis and the integrals @xmath131 determine the diameter and position of the enveloping cylinder in the @xmath132plane @xmath133 when @xmath134 the helix collapses into a circle in the plane @xmath135 .",
    "thus the problem reduces to the two - dimensional one .",
    "let us now restrict to the case @xmath136 .",
    "+ by inspection of the solution of the equations of motion one finds that this system is maximally superintegrable with , however , the fifth independent integral not polynomial in momenta .",
    "it reads @xmath137 how to interpret this integral in the quantum case is not too clear .",
    "however , if we restrict ourselves to the subspace in the hilbert space defined by the constraint @xmath138 we can expand @xmath139 into a convergent taylor series in @xmath140 .",
    "we can then interpret the quantum integral of motion @xmath139 as an operator in the `` extended enveloping algebra '' of the heisenberg algebra .",
    "+ alternatively , for the classical hamiltonian we can perform a canonical transformation in the @xmath141 plane @xmath142 which transforms the integrals into @xmath143 thus @xmath144 becomes a first order polynomial in the momenta .",
    "the price is that @xmath145 no longer has the `` natural '' form  ( [ constbham ] ) .",
    "+ the integrals @xmath146 give rise to a lie algebra of integrals of motion in the following manner .",
    "we define additional functionally dependent integrals @xmath147 and redefine the first integral to be @xmath148 the poisson brackets now form a 7dimensional lie subalgebra of integrals of motion in the algebra of observables on our system , with the lie brackets @xmath149 this algebra is solvable with 5dimensional nilradical spanned by @xmath150 .",
    "the nilradical is isomorphic to the heisenberg algebra in two spatial dimensions ( @xmath151 in the notation of  @xcite ) .",
    "the element @xmath152 spans the center .",
    "its casimir invariants are the central element @xmath152 and two second order invariants @xmath153 , @xmath154 which both reduce to the hamiltonian  ( [ constbham ] ) once the explicit form of the integrals is inserted into them . + we observe that in terms of the original integral @xmath91 instead of its square @xmath155 we obtain an infinite - dimensional loop algebra . + as it is well - known in the physics literature ( see e.g.  @xcite , pg . 220 ) , the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian  ( [ constbham ] ) separates in cartesian coordinates as follows @xmath156 the reduced schrdinger equation ( [ reducedconstb ] ) is the stationary schrdinger equation for the 1dimensional harmonic oscillator with the energy @xmath157 , frequency @xmath158 and the center of the force at @xmath159 .",
    "thus the spectrum of the hamiltonian  ( [ constbham ] ) is continuous due to the arbitrary momentum @xmath160 and reads @xmath161 the eigenvectors are expressed in terms of hermite polynomials @xmath162 it was conjectured in  @xcite that all maximally superintegrable quantum systems in euclidean spaces are exactly solvable .",
    "equations  ( [ constbspectrum ] ) , ( [ constbeigenvectors ] ) confirm this conjecture for a particle in a constant magnetic field .",
    "this is true even though one of the independent integrals @xmath163 is not polynomial in its natural setting . *",
    "if @xmath164 we have to distinguish further subcases . if @xmath165 the system again reduces to a constant magnetic field and vanishing electric field .",

    "as before , this calculation is the same in both classical and quantum mechanics .",

    "the computation in the quantum case is essentially the same .",
    "we obtain the same structure of the potentials  ( [ l3p3abm ] ) and the integrals @xmath225 thus the stationary schrdinger equation separates in the polar coordinates @xmath226 as follows @xmath227    like in the previous section let us now turn our attention towards possible superintegrable hamiltonians which are integrable by virtue of the integrals  ( [ l3p3final ] ) .",
    "we assume first an additional integral in the first order form @xmath228 as before , the compatibility of equations  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) strongly restricts the possibilities .",
    "namely ,    * if @xmath229 then the magnetic field @xmath84 must vanish , i.e. this case is of no interest to us here ; * if @xmath230 then we arrive at the already discussed superintegrable case of the constant magnetic field and vanishing electric field .",
    "thus we have not found any nontrivial hamiltonian with magnetic field superintegrable at the first order with the integrals  ( [ l3p3final ] ) .",

    "thus we have to conclude that the system with the potentials and field strength  ( [ l3p3abm ] ) is not first or second order minimally superintegrable for any nonconstant choice of the magnetic field @xmath84 and the electrostatic potential @xmath1 .",
    "the same result applies also to the quantum case where only the difference between equations  ( [ 0ordcond ] ) and  ( [ 0ordcondquant ] ) needs to be considered .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the case when we have three first order integrals of motion  ( [ l1l2l3 ] ) . we can not choose among them two in involution but we easily obtain a second order integral @xmath236 which is in involution with all of them . thus assuming that we have the integrals",
    "@xmath237 we have immediately a minimally superintegrable system .",
    "the compatibility of equations  ( [ 1ordcond ] ) for the three integrals @xmath87 and @xmath238 leads directly to the following 1parameter family of solutions for the magnetic field @xmath239 i.e. the only possibility is a magnetic monopole of an arbitrary strength @xmath240 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath40 is always singular at least along a halfline connecting the origin to infinity .",

    "this rotational invariance of the magnetic monopole was already observed in  @xcite .",
    "next , we shall look for an additional independent integral @xmath246 of the form  ( [ classintuea ] ) , i.e. at most second order in momenta , which would make our system maximally superintegrable .",

    "we notice that the restrictions imposed are more general than the ones under which a similar result was derived in @xcite . +",
    "while it may be surprising that no modification of the isotropic harmonic oscillator arose in our calculation , we refer the reader to @xcite where it was demonstrated that it is maximally superintegrable but with fourth order integrals , not at most second , as considered here .",
    "in section  [ conintmot ] we derived the determining equations ( [ hoconds])([0ordcond ] ) for the coefficients of a general second order integral of motion  ( [ classint ] ) and discussed their compatibility conditions . as in the case of a purely scalar potential  @xcite the coefficients @xmath261 satisfy equations  ( [ hoconds ] ) that do not depend on the potentials .",
    "these equations  ( [ hoconds ] ) are easy to solve and imply that the leading terms in the integral @xmath262 lie in the enveloping algebra of the euclidean lie algebra @xmath263 . as opposed to the scalar case @xmath264 , first order terms in @xmath262 are not excluded ( even and odd terms do not commute separately ) .",
    "also , for @xmath265 the classical and quantum determining equations differ , see  ( [ 0ordcondquant ] ) .",
    "we recall that for scalar particles the classical and quantum determining equations and hence also the integrals of motion and the superintegrable hamiltonians differ only for integrals of order @xmath266  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "these determining equations and also their compatibility conditions are difficult to solve .",
    "indeed , if the magnetic field @xmath84 and the potential @xmath1 are not known the equations are nonlinear .",
    "they can be used in several manners .",
    "first of all , for the system to be second order integrable two such integrals must exist in addition to the hamiltonian and they must commute .",
    "the leading order terms of such pairs of commuting integrals were classified into 11 conjugacy classes  @xcite under euclidean transformations and this classification remains the same for @xmath267 though the nonleading terms are different . in the purely scalar case each class corresponds to the separation of variables in the hamilton - jacobi equation and in the schrdinger equation , respectively .",
    "this correspondence no longer holds in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , for @xmath267 it is still possible to consider each class separately and this allows significant simplifications .",
    "the case of integrals of motion with leading terms of the form @xmath268 was studied in  @xcite .",
    "it is actually easier to study superintegrable systems than integrable ones since the conditions on the potentials are more constraining . in this article",
    "we have determined all superintegrable systems with at least 2 first order integrals and at least four independent integrals altogether ( including the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we have found the following superintegrable systems :    1 .   a constant magnetic field and no electric field  ( [ constbpots ] ) .",
    "this system has 4 first order integrals  ( [ constbints ] ) , the hamiltonian is a polynomial in these four .",
    "the system is maximally superintegrable but the fifth integral @xmath163  ( [ constb5int ] ) is a transcendental function of the momenta rather than a polynomial . in classical mechanics",
    "this is not a problem . in quantum mechanics",
    "there are difficulties with its interpretation .",
    "this system is well - known to be exactly solvable  @xcite but to our knowledge its maximal superintegrability has not be noticed before .",
    "the poisson algebra of integrals of motion is given in  ( [ tabcomms ] ) .",
    "the system  ( [ p1p2siav ] ) with a periodic magnetic field and zero electric one .",
    "there are 3 first order integrals @xmath217 and @xmath99 , the hamiltonian @xmath269 and one nonpolynomial integral .",
    "the classical trajectories are given in terms of elliptic functions  ( [ odeellints ] ) and examples are given on figure  [ figure1 ] and figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "the schdinger equation is solved in terms of periodic mathieu functions  ( [ mattsol ] ) .",
    "the energy spectrum is continuous .",
    "3 .   the magnetic monopole with the magnetic field  ( [ l1l2l3b ] ) and the scalar potential  ( [ monopolecoulomb ] ) .",
    "its second order maximal superintegrability is well - known  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that it is the only second order spherically symmetric maximally superintegrable system in @xmath5 with nonvanishing magnetic field .",
    "a fourth order superintegrable system is also known  @xcite .",
    "all maximally superintegrable systems presented in this article are exactly solvable , both in classical and quantum mechanics . to show their superintegrability it was necessary to consider nonpolynomial and nonrational integrals of motion . in a completely different context nonpolynomial integrals",
    "arise also for the purely scalar potentials , see e.g.  @xcite .    in @xcite the structure of the gauge ",
    "invariant integrable and superintegrable systems involving vector potentials was considered in two spatial dimensions . among other results",
    "it was shown there that under the assumption that the integrals are at most second order in momenta every superintegrable system in dimension 2 has constant magnetic field . however , as we have seen in section  [ secl1l2l3 ] in three spatial dimensions the second order maximal superintegrability does not imply constant magnetic field .",
