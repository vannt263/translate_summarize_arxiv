    "although previously considered a system in equilibrium , observations of the hydra i cluster core , dominated by ngc 3311 , have shown instead a complex , ongoing process of assembly of matter . recently , reported the existence of an faint surface brightness offset envelope . in part",
    "i of our work ( see hilker at al . in this proceedings ) , we have shown that the envelope substructure have line - of - sight velocity distributions distinct from the surrounding regions , which is also related to a group of infalling galaxies .",
    "has shown that the stellar content in the region of the offset envelope is different from the other regions , thus attesting that stellar populations can be used to trace and constrain the processes involved in galaxy disruption and in the build up of the massive cd galaxies . however , a spatially resolved study to observe the shape and extent of the stellar population features was still missing .",
    "therefore , here we aim to further demonstrate that the hydra i core is indeed actively forming using stellar populations as tracers of the past evolution of the system .",
    "we have used our novel fors2/vlt spectroscopic data set ( programme 88.b-448 ; pi : richtler ) , i.e. short slits placed in an onion shell - like pattern onto ngc 3311 to mimic a coarse ` ifu ' .",
    "the data set consists of high resolution optical spectra for 130 positions out to @xmath130 kpc ( @xmath13 effective radii ) .",
    "we modelled seven absorption line features in the lick / ids system with the alpha - enhanced models of @xcite using a monte carlo markov chains method in order to obtain uncertainties and to access whether we can break the well known metallicity - age degeneracy .",
    "we present results for the luminosity - weighted ages , metallicities , and alpha element abundances in fig .",
    "the offset envelope exhibits populations which are slightly younger , more metal - rich and have lower alpha abundances .",
    "these results are consistent with the `` two stages '' formation scenario of central galaxies : the central parts form first `` in situ '' , possibly in a quasi monolithic collapse with violent starbursts .",
    "the outer regions then grow by accreting less massive systems with extended periods of star formation .",
    "based on observations made with eso telescopes at the la silla paranal observatory .",
