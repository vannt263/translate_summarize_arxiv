    "kiso ultraviolet - excess galaxies ( hereafter kugs ) are a blue galaxy sample selected from photographic @xmath6 three - color images taken by the kiso observatory 105-cm schmidt telescope ( takase & miyauchi - isobe 1993 , and references therein , hereafter tm93 ) .",
    "the survey selected galaxies if they had a greater uv excess than a - type stars seen on the same plates .",
    "the kug survey has been carried out mainly on the northern celestial hemisphere over @xmath7 , and contains roughly 8200 objects .",
    "the depth of the survey is @xmath8 mag in photographic magnitude .",
    "a second kug survey is in progress .",
    "a general description of the survey method and the statistical properties of kug objects is given in takase ( 1980 ) .",
    "a galaxy that has experienced a star formation ( sf ) episode less than @xmath9 yr ( sub - gyr ) ago contains an elevated number of a stars and so can be identified by a bluer than average color . the so - called butcher  oemler galaxies are mostly in this category ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "photometric ( maehara et al . 1988 ) , spectroscopic ( maehara et al . 1987 , 1988 ; augarde et al . 1994 ; comte et al . 1994 ) , and radio ( maehara et al .",
    "1985 , 1988 ) observations have revealed that kugs as a class exhibit star formation .",
    "thus , the kug survey is a good sample of galaxies to use in examining objects that have experienced periods of star formation within the recent sub - gyr in the local universe .",
    "tomita et al .",
    "( 1997)(ttus97 ) have quantified the general characteristics of a large number of kugs using optical color , morphology , and fir data . here",
    "we briefly summarize their results .    1 .",
    "the kug selection was originally based on a plate search , and the classification of galaxies into blue and non - blue ones proved to work well even in terms of the total color sytems , but the boundary color is slightly redder than that of a - stars ; that is , 22 % of the kugs have the non - kug colors , and the boundary color separating kugs and non - kugs is @xmath10 mag . 2 .",
    "kugs are preferentially sb- or later - type spiral galaxies .",
    "the kug fraction changes linearly along the hubble sequence : it is less than 10 % for e / s0 and more than 50 % for sd / sm .",
    "kugs are biased toward less luminous galaxies . at around the knee of the luminosity function ( lf ) where @xmath11-luminosity @xmath12 , most of the kugs are spiral galaxies . in the fainter regime of @xmath13 ,",
    "the dwarf population dominates .",
    "4 .   the fraction of the blue population in a survey depends on the depth of the survey .",
    "if the survey is volume - limited and deep enough to pick up the bulk of the dwarf population , its fraction would be higher .",
    "the distribution of kugs is inhomogeneous , not only when compared with a uniform distribution but also in comparison with the ambient galaxy distribution .",
    "consequently there are some `` kug - rich regions '' .",
    "this inhomogeneity may be related to environmental effects .",
    "some studies show that a dense environment activates star formation ( e.g. maia et al .",
    "1994 ; pastoriza et al .",
    "1994 ) . on the other hand",
    ", recent observational studies ( e.g. zabludoff et al . 1996(z96 ) ) suggest that a low - density environment can enhance star formation .",
    "therefore , the question is unsettled .",
    "in this study we statistically analyzed the fraction of kugs in the whole galaxy population and discovered four kug - rich regions .",
    "among them was a region which lies in the constellations of lynx and ursa major ( @xmath14 ) . in this region , there is a galaxy filament with a length of @xmath15 mpc ( we use @xmath16 as the hubble parameter throughout this paper ) .",
    "we call this structure the lynx - ursa major ( hereafter lum ) filament .",
    "we obtained @xmath3 surface photometry of eleven kugs in this region in order to make a quantitative analyses of the star formation properties and effects of local environment on star formation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes our statistical survey methods and the kug - rich regions found .",
    "sample selection , observation , and data reduction of the @xmath3 photometry of the eleven kugs in lum filament are discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents the results of our photometry .",
    "discussion based on the photometry is made in section 5 .",
    "finally in section 6 , we present a summary of our results .",
    "first we searched for regions in which the total galaxy population contains a large fraction of kugs .",
    "a single kiso schmidt plate has a field of view of @xmath17 .",
    "the previously noted variation in survey depth is caused by differences in plate quality . to avoid a bias caused by the variation of the photographic - plate depths",
    ", we required that our sample galaxies also be included in the magnitude - limited portion of the _ catalogue of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies _ ( zwicky et al .",
    "1961  1968 , cgcg ) .",
    "this limited our sample to objects with @xmath18 mag .",
    "( corresponding to @xmath19 mag , kirshner et al .",
    "1978 ) at @xmath20 .",
    "although the faint limit of the cgcg has some uncertainties ( e.g. takamiya et al .",
    "1995 ) , they do not affect our analysis .",
    "hereafter we use the term kug for galaxies listed in both the cgcg and kug catalogs .",
    "the kug population fraction , @xmath21 , was defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 = [ the total number of cgcg galaxies on a plate ] and @xmath24 = [ the number of kugs on the same plate ] .",
    "we first formed this statistic for the individual @xmath25 photographic plates . using only this number",
    ", we found some tentative `` kug - rich '' regions .",
    "we were still concerned , however , that these could be false effects caused by the differing depth of each photographic plate . to check on this we recalculated @xmath21 for the same sized areas in an offset `` tessellation '' that was independent of the location of the original kiso fields .",
    "both methods yielded almost the same result , implying that the effects of the plate - quality difference was effectively surpressed by using the cgcg subsample .",
    "we also formed the @xmath21 statistic for areas with sizes ranging between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , again with no significant change in results .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of @xmath21 versus @xmath23 .",
    "each symbol represents @xmath21 of a @xmath25-area from the offset tessellation .",
    "the next step was to determine the statistical significance of the kug - rich regions .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the mean kug fraction has a value of @xmath28 % which is essentially independent of @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore assumed that @xmath29 represents the mean kug fraction .",
    "the probability density of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath23 , @xmath30 , follows a binomial distribution given by @xmath31 the standard deviation , @xmath32 , is @xmath33 the probability @xmath34 that @xmath21 has the value @xmath35 in a population of @xmath23 cgcg galaxies is @xmath36 equations ( [ sig1 ] ) and ( [ bino2 ] ) give a standard deviation for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , of @xmath39 the smaller @xmath23 is , the larger @xmath38 becomes .",
    "this is well expressed in fig . 1 which shows confidence limits of 99.9 % , 99.99 % , and 99.999 % as long - dashed , dotted , and dashed lines .",
    "we define the kug - rich regions as those in which @xmath21 is greater than or equal to the 99.99% confidence limit . the filled symbols in fig .",
    "1 represent the kug - rich regions .",
    "eight filled symbols are plotted in fig . 1 , but b overlaps one of the ds , and c overlaps one of the es making the number of filled symbols appear as six .",
    "circles with the same labels are regions adjacent to each other on the sky . the large extent of the regions and the high confidence limit",
    "both show that these regions are not mere products of chance .",
    "an all - sky map containing the kug - rich regions we discovered is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure",
    "the small dots represent the distribution of cgcg galaxies in kug - survey regions , and the black hatches depict the kug - rich regions . their labels ( a , b , c , d , and e ) correspond to the same lables in fig .",
    "1 . kug - rich region e contains the galaxy cluster zwicky 1615.8 + 3505 . unfortunately",
    ", this contains kug area a0432 ( center position : @xmath40 ) , which has been reported to contain a sizable fraction of non - blue galaxies that should not have been in the kiso survey ( miyauchi - isobe , takase , & maehara 1997 ) .",
    "the cluster itself has other interesting aspects , the details of which will be presented elsewhere ( tomita et al .",
    "other four regions have no virialized galaxy structures , i.e. , they are in the `` field '' .",
    "details on region a are presented in section [ lumfil ] .",
    "region b seems to be a part of a filamentary structures of galaxies in proximity to canes venatici void .",
    "region c may also belong to a filament surrounding the gemini void , and region d may associate with a filament between the leo and coma voids that is connected to the coma cluster ( fairall 1998 ) .",
    "we summarize the parameters of these kug - rich regions in table 1 .",
    "column 1 gives the labels of kug - rich regions presented in fig .",
    "1 and fig .",
    "their approximate positions are given in columns 2 and 3 , and corresponding kug field numbers are shown in column 4 . since the offset tessellation defines a grid centered different from the original kiso survey field blocks , the black - hatched regions in fig . 2 and the kiso fields given in column 4 of table 1 are at slightly different positions .",
    "around region a , we found a filament structure of galaxies in the cfa survey ( e.g. de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1986 ) .",
    "we name it `` the lynx - ursa major ( lum ) filament '' after the constellation it lies in .",
    "this is an elongated and winding structure extending along the line of sight between @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 , at @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the far end of the filament connects to the great wall ( geller & huchra 1989 ) .",
    "we note that , although `` the lynx - ursa major supercluster '' named by giovanelli & haynes ( 1982 ) and the lum filament are connected , these are actually distinct structures , and the former is much larger .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) studied the orientation of the spin vectors of galaxies belonging to a filamentary structure in this area .",
    "they named it `` the ursa major filament '' .",
    "their filament is part of the left leg of the `` cfa homunculus '' , and differs from our lum filament . as mentioned above , region d is associated with han et al.s filament .",
    "we summarize the parameters of the lum filament in table 2 .",
    "we obtained surface photometry of the kugs in the lum filament that met the following selection criteria : ( 1 ) an angular diameter @xmath46 , ( 2 ) a small inclination ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the first criterion was to ensure the sample galaxies were large enough to allow the identification and analysis of their star - forming regions .",
    "the second criterion was to minimize the effect of internal extinction on the objects , the correction of which is uncertain ( buta & williams 1995 , hereafter bw95 ) .",
    "eleven objects met these criteria .",
    "we compile their names , positions , and basic properties in table 3 .",
    "column 1 gives the serial number of the objects , and columns 2 and 3 give their kug and cgcg names respectively .",
    "columns 4 and 5 give their positions ( b1950.0 equinox ) extracted from ned .",
    "columns 6 and 7 give their recession velocity and @xmath48 magnitudes , both from _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 , hereafter rc3 ) . the recession velocities are galactocentric .",
    "column 8 gives the absolute @xmath11-magnitude of the objects calculated from @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "all of the samples are _ iras _ point sources .",
    "next we examine whether our selected sample is fair or not .",
    "the lum filament lies at @xmath50 to @xmath51 . among the 11 sample kugs , no .",
    "1 is the nearest , nos .",
    "2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 are located in the nearer half of the filament , nos . 5 and 10 in the further half , and nos . 4 and 11 at the further end .",
    "therefore our sample is not strongly correlated with redshift in the manner of the kug and cgcg ( see fig.7 of ttus97 ) .",
    "next we check the galaxy luminosities .",
    "the lf of the kugs show schechter - like behavior ( schechter 1976 ) , with a knee at @xmath52 , corresponding to @xmath53 mag ( ttus97 ) .",
    "the brightest object is no .",
    "11 ( @xmath54 mag ) and the faintest is no .",
    "9 ( @xmath55 mag ) .",
    "the others distribute rather uniformly between the two .",
    "our sample consists of slightly bright kugs , but as a whole , it is not strongly biased toward brighter luminosities .",
    "we note that there are no agns in the sample .",
    "we obtained @xmath3 surface photometry using the 105-cm schmidt telescope at the kiso observatory ( hereafter kiso ) .",
    "the nights were photometric and had seeing conditions of typically a few arcseconds .",
    "the observation log is given in table 4 .",
    "column 1 shows the names of the sample kugs .",
    "the observed date is presented in column 2 .",
    "column 3 gives the i d numbers of the obtained orginal ccd image frames at kiso .",
    "the optical system at the prime focus has a focal ratio of @xmath56 .",
    "we mounted at the prime focus a single - chip ccd camera which uses a ti japan tc215 frontside - illuminated @xmath57 chip .",
    "one pixel size corresponded to @xmath58 , giving a total field of about @xmath59 .",
    "nonlinearity was @xmath60 % at @xmath61 counts , which is too small to give rise to any significant photometric error .",
    "we used broadband johnson @xmath62 , cousins @xmath63 , and @xmath64 filters .",
    "the kiso @xmath62- , @xmath63- , and @xmath64-band response functions are in good agreement with the standard filter transmissions so we did not need any color corrections .",
    "the exposure time for all objects and filters was 900 sec .",
    "the basic data reduction consisted of a bias subtraction , flatfielding , and cosmic - ray elimination , using iraf .",
    "sky subtraction was accomplished via a polynomial - surface fit to the sky regions using spiral ( hamabe & ichikawa 1992 ) .",
    "we made various tests to estimate the uncertainty of the sky subtraction , which turned out to be @xmath65 % .",
    "flux calibration was done by observing the equatorial photometric standard stars of landolt ( 1992 ) throughout the night .",
    "the differences of the standard magnitudes from the original values of cousins for our @xmath62- , @xmath66- , and @xmath67-bands are small enough ( menzies et al .",
    "1991 ) , to preclude making any corrections .",
    "we obtained integrated magnitudes for each object from the asymptotic limit of a circular - aperture curve of growth after any stars were removed from the galaxy image .",
    "we used the template curve of growth provided by kodaira , okamura , & ichikawa ( 1990 ) for testing the convergent value of the curve of growth .",
    "the reliability of this method is examined in tomita et al .",
    "the total error induced by all procedures is typically @xmath68 mag .    in order to better estimate the colors of the objects",
    ", we corrected for differences caused by variations in the seeing size and position between the images taken in different bandpasses .",
    "we used iraf and spiral for this procedure . for the detailed color analysis we used idl ( interactive data language )",
    "we show the results of the photometry in table 5 .",
    "column 1 gives the name of the galaxy .",
    "columns 2 , 3 , and 4 give the apparent integrated @xmath62- , @xmath63- , and @xmath64-magnitudes respectively .",
    "no correction for internal or external extinction has been applied for the _ apparent _ magnitudes .",
    "columns 5 , 6 , and 7 give the derived total absolute magnitudes after correction for galactic extinction .",
    "the galactic extinction value at lynx  ursa major , derived from the maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , is @xmath69 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath70 mag , @xmath71 mag , and @xmath72 mag when we apply @xmath73 , using the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "absolute magnitudes are dereddened by these values .",
    "we did not apply any correction for inclination .",
    "no attempt has been made to apply @xmath74-correction because of the closeness of our sample .",
    "these are the first photometric measurements for all but one of these objects , kug0953 + 466 .",
    "this object is also mrk 129 ( markarian et al .",
    "1989 ) , and has johnson @xmath62- and @xmath66- band photometry from huchra ( 1977)(h77 ) . using 24@xmath75-aperture photometry , the same aperture size as h77 , we measured the @xmath62- and @xmath63-magnitudes for comparison .",

    "this galaxy is an interacting system of a giant spiral and a small amorphous satellite .",
    "one of the main conclusions of ttus97 is that , in terms of stellar population , the late - type kugs are mostly normal galaxies and the early - type kugs often turned out to be peculiar galaxies .",
    "the color difference between the kugs and non - kugs is significant for @xmath135 , and indicates that the early - type kugs have a young stellar population for their morphologies .",
    "compact galaxies tend to be included in the early - type galaxy classification as peculiar early - types and are thus not really a proper member of the class . on the other hand , though the spiral kugs in our sample have a young stellar population in their disks which makes their appearance quite knotty , they are rather normal for their morphology .",
    "this is also consistent with the above result of ttus97 .",

    "therefore they are `` active normal spirals '' .      here",
    "we examine the relation between the colors , ages , morphologies , and environments of our samples .",
    "many authors have claimed a close connection between active star formation and morphological distortion .",
    "for example , bcd95 have performed a quantitative morphological analysis of their mbg starbursts by fourier transforming the isophotes of sample galaxies .",
    "they concluded that the star formation regions associate with isophotal twists . such distortion or twist from symmetry",

    "half of our sample is isolated galaxies .",
    "only one has a tidally - connected companion .",
    "thus , we can not attribute the starformation in our sample to distortion features , though galaxy encounters might be responsible for some of the starbursts .",
    "we next consider the relations between the stellar ages implied by the color distribution and other properties . a clear morphological relation exists .",
    "compact galaxies which have a featureless appearance have very young superposing stellar components ( @xmath125 yr ) , i.e. on - going starbursts , spread over the whole galaxy .",
    "in contrast , giant spiral galaxies which have well - developed arms have more aged stellar components ( @xmath132 yr ) in their disks , and their bulge is old .",
    "the age scatter is large in each spiral sample .",
    "but there is an exception , kug0947 + 445a , which is a spiral galaxy but has a small dispersion of partial colors .",
    "we note that this is a physically small galaxy , as we saw in section [ distsf ] .",
    "the color dispersion appears to correlate with galaxy size with larger galaxies having a greater dispersion .",
    "finally we look into the relation between the stellar age and existence of companions .",
    "the most active star forming galaxy is kug 0919 + 474 , which is a compact galaxy in a group having a burst age of @xmath125 yr .",
    "isolated compact galaxy kug 0908 + 468 also has rather young starbursts , but their ages are not as young as those of kug 0919 + 474 .",
    "another isolated compact kug 0953 + 466 has a burst age of @xmath125 yr , with a small burst mass fraction of ( @xmath136 % ) implied .",
    "spiral galaxies have similar stellar ages with each other .",
    "some kugs in a group or with companions have rather younger stellar ages , like kug 1007 + 461 and kug1016 + 467 .",
    "in contrast , other kugs with companions have the superposing stellar components consistent with intermidiate ages , like kug 0945 + 443 and kug 0947 + 445a .",
    "thus , there is no clear relation between the superposing stellar age and the existence of companions .",
    "we have focused on the collective star formation enhancement of galaxies , and searched for the regions where such phenomena have occurred using the kiso ultraviolet - excess galaxy ( kug ) catalog as a sf - enhanced galaxy sample . through our survey",
    "we found four kug - rich regions , one of which turned out to be associated with a filamentary structure .",
    "we named it `` the lynx - ursa major ( lum ) filament '' after its location on the sky ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "we then investigated the star formation properties of the kugs in the lum .",
    "our results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the eleven kug objects we examined in the lum filament proved to be generally blue by ccd photometry , and they show a much larger scatter on c - c diagrams than that of normal galaxies .",
    "this is similar to those of other uv - excess galaxy surveys , such as the markarian survey , or mbg survey .",
    "2 .   the spiral subset of the sample has conspicuous hii - region knots in their arms .",
    "the rest are compact galaxies with no structure and an extremely blue color .",
    "we suggest that the former corresponds to the kug subset of `` normal late - type spiral galaxies '' , and the latter corresponds to the `` peculiar early - type galaxies '' , proposed by ttus97 .",
    "the star formation of our sample kugs occurs in the whole disk , and is not concentrated in the central regions .",
    "this is different from those of sbngs which are the main constituent of the mbg survey .",
    "none of our sample kugs have nuclear activity .",
    "the age of their young stellar population is @xmath118 yr .",
    "compact samples have very young superposing stellar components ( @xmath125 yr ) spread over the whole galaxy , while giant spiral samples have moderately aged stellar components ( @xmath132 yr ) in their disks , and and an older bulge .",
    "the age scatter is large in each spiral sample .",
    "star formation properties of giant spiral samples and compact samples are clearly different , implying that the star formation is regulated by the inner galaxy environment .",
    "4 .   only one kug exhibits an explicit interaction feature , although half of our sample have some companions .",
    "however , most of the spiral subset of our sample show distortions or isophotal twists .",
    "this indicates that a weak encounter may have activated the star formation , though we should note that their morphological distortion is not necessarily due to an external force .",
    "the age and strength of star formation in individual samples has no relation to the existence of companions , implying that star formation may not be activated by the local environment .",
    "we should also note that there are no extremely peculiar galaxies in this region .",
