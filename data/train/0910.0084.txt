    "ae aqr is a bright ( @xmath21 ) nova - like cataclysmic binary consisting of a magnetic white dwarf primary and a k45 v secondary with a long 9.88 hr orbital period and the shortest known white dwarf spin period @xmath22 s @xcite .",
    "although originally classified and interpreted as a disk - accreting dq her star @xcite , ae aqr displays a number of unusual characteristics that are not naturally explained by this model .",
    "first , violent flaring activity is observed in the radio , optical , ultraviolet ( uv ) , x - ray , and tev @xmath23-rays . second , the balmer emission lines are single - peaked and produce doppler tomograms that are not consistent with those of an accretion disk .",
    "third , the white dwarf is spinning down at a rate @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "although this corresponds to the small rate of change of @xmath25 , ae aqr s spin - down is typically characterized as `` rapid '' because the characteristic time @xmath26 yr is short compared to the lifetime of the binary and because the spin - down luminosity @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the moment of inertia for a white dwarf of mass @xmath29 and radius @xmath30 cm , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) exceeds the secondary s thermonuclear luminosity by an order of magnitude and the accretion luminosity by two orders of magnitude .",
    "because of its unique properties and variable emission across the electromagnetic spectrum , ae aqr has been the subject of numerous studies , including an intensive multiwavelength observing campaign in 1993 october [ @xcite , and the series of papers in asp conf .   ser",
    ".  85 @xcite ] . based on these studies , ae",
    "aqr is now widely believed to be a former supersoft x - ray binary @xcite and current _ magnetic propeller _",
    "@xcite , with most of the mass lost by the secondary being flung out of the binary by the magnetic field of the rapidly rotating white dwarf .",
    "these models explain many of ae aqr s unique characteristics , including the fast spin rate and rapid secular spin - down rate of the white dwarf , the anomalous spectral type of the secondary , the anomalous abundances @xcite , the absence of signatures of an accretion disk @xcite , the violent flaring activity @xcite , and the origin of the radio and tev @xmath23-ray emission @xcite .    to build on this observational and theoretical work , while taking advantage of a number of improvements in observing capabilities , during 2005 august 28september 2 , a group of professional and amateur astronomers conducted a campaign of multiwavelength ( radio , optical , uv , x - ray , and tev @xmath23-ray ) observations of ae aqr .",
    "attention is restricted here to the results of the x - ray observations , obtained with the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) and the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. @xcite has previously provided an analysis and discussion of the timing properties of these data , showing that : ( 1 ) as in the optical and uv , the x - ray spin pulse follows the motion of the white dwarf around the binary center of mass and ( 2 ) during the decade 19952005 , the white dwarf spun down at a rate that is slightly faster than predicted by the @xcite spin ephemeris . here",
    ", we present a more complete analysis and discussion of the _ chandra _   data , providing results that in many ways reproduce the results of the previous _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite and the subsequent _ suzaku _ @xcite observations of ae aqr , but also that are new and unique to the hetg ; namely , the detailed nature of the time - average x - ray spectrum , the plasma densities implied by the he @xmath15 triplet flux ratios , and the widths and radial velocities of the x - ray emission lines .",
    "as we will see , these results appear to be inconsistent with the recent models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite of an extended , low - density source of x - rays in ae aqr , but instead support earlier models in which the dominant source of x - rays is of high density and/or in close proximity to the white dwarf .    the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss the observations and the analysis of the x - ray light curve (  2.1 ) , spin - phase light curve (  2.2 ) , spectrum (  2.3 ) , and radial velocities (  2.4 ) . in ",
    "3 we provide a summary of our results . in ",
    "4 we discuss the results and explore white dwarf (  4.1 ) , accretion column (  4.2 ) , and magnetosphere (  4.3 ) models of the source of the x - ray emission in ae aqr . in ",
    "5 we draw conclusions , discuss the bombardment model of the accretion flow of ae aqr , and close with a few comments regarding future observations . the casual reader may wish to skip ",

    "ae aqr was observed by _ chandra _  beginning on 2005 august 30 at 06:37 ut for 78 ks ( ) .",
    "the level 2 data files used for this analysis were produced by the standard pipeline processing software ascds version 7.6.7.1 and caldb version 3.2.1 and were processed with the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 3.4 software tools to convert the event times in the evt2 file from terrestrial time ( tt ) to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) and to make the grating response matrix files ( rmfs ) and the auxiliary response files ( arfs ) needed for quantitative spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the subsequent analysis was performed in the following manner using custom interactive data language ( idl ) software .",
    "first , using the region masks in the pha2 file , the source and background events for the @xmath33 first - order medium energy grating ( meg ) and high energy grating ( heg ) spectra were collected from the evt2 file .",
    "second , after careful investigation , @xmath34   ( @xmath35  ) was added to the @xmath33 first - order meg ( heg ) wavelengths , respectively , to account for an apparent shift ( by 0.27 acis pixels ) in the position of the zero - order image .",
    "third , to account for the spin pulse delay measured in the optical , uv , and x - ray wavebands @xcite produced by the motion of the white dwarf around the binary center of mass , @xmath36 s was added to the event times @xmath37 , where the white dwarf orbit phase @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 d and @xmath41 are the orbit ephemeris constants from table 4 of @xcite .",
    "fourth , to account for the doppler shifts produced by _",
    "s ( mostly , earth s ) motion relative to the solar system barycenter , the event wavelengths @xmath42 were multiplied by a factor @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the ( time - dependent ) line - of - sight velocity between the spacecraft and the source , determined using an idl code kindly supplied by r.   hoogerwerf ( and checked against the line - of - sight velocities derived from the barycentric time corrections supplied by the ciao tool axbary ) ; during the observation , @xmath44 varied from @xmath45 at the beginning of the observation , rose to @xmath46 , and then fell to @xmath47 at the end of the observation .",
    "fifth , a filter was applied to restrict attention to events from two orbital cycles @xmath4820505.9 , resulting in an effective exposure of 71 ks .",
    "sixth , white dwarf spin pulse phases were calculated using the updated cubic spin ephemeris of @xcite derived from the recent _ asca _ ( 1995 october ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( 2001 november ) and the current _ chandra _   observation of ae aqr : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 d , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the spin ephemeris constants from table 4 of @xcite , and @xmath55 .",

    "as has been well established by previous x - ray observations , the x - ray light curve of ae aqr is dominated by flares , although this is by far the longest uninterrupted observation of ae aqr and hence the clearest view of its x - ray light curve . during the _ chandra _  observation , the flares last between a few hundred and a few thousand seconds , producing increases of up to 35 times the baseline count rate of @xmath59 .        to constrain the cause and nature of the flares of ae aqr ,",
    "it is of interest to determine if the count rate variations shown in figure 1 are accompanied by , or perhaps are even due to , dramatic variations in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "previous investigations have indicated that this is not the case . for a flare observed by _ asca _ , @xcite found no significant difference between the quiescent and flare x - ray spectra , although a `` hint '' of spectral hardening was recognized during the flare . for a flare observed by _ xmm - newton _",
    ", @xcite found that the x - ray spectrum at the beginning of the flare was similar to that in quiescence , but that the spectrum became harder as the flare advanced .",
    "our ability to investigate spectral variations during the individual flares observed by _",
    "chandra _  is limited by the relatively low hetg count rate and the relatively fast timescale of the flares , although it is possible to investigate spectral variations for the ensemble of the flares . to accomplish this ,",
    "the light curve shown in figure 1 was divided into five count rate ranges : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , where the count rate cuts were set to produce a roughly equal number of counts per count rate range , and the source and background counts were collected in three wavebands : hard ( 18  ) , medium ( 811  ) , and soft ( 1126  ) , where the wavelength cuts were set to produce a roughly equal number of counts per wavelength interval .",
    "the background - subtracted soft @xmath65 over hard @xmath66 versus the total ( 126  ) count rates are plotted in figure 2 . the dotted line in that figure is the best - fitting constant function @xmath67 for the first three data points ( count rate ranges @xmath68@xmath69 ) . as shown by the figure ,",
    "the softness ratio of the next higher count rate range @xmath70 is consistent with the lower ranges , while that of the highest count rate range @xmath71 is significantly ( @xmath72 ) less .",
    "consistent with the result of @xcite , we find that the x - ray spectrum of the flares of ae aqr is harder than that in quiescence only at the peak of the flares .",

    "the above result applies to the observation - average spin - phase light curve , although it is of interest to determine if the x - ray pulse semi - amplitude @xmath83 and/or the relative semi - amplitude @xmath82 varies with the mean count rate @xmath81 . as for the investigation of the softness ratio variations ,",
    "this is best determined as a function of time , using a time resolution sufficient to resolve the flares , but this is not possible with the relatively low count rate hetg data . instead",
    ", background - subtracted spin - phase count rate light curves were derived from the hetg event data for each of the five count rate ranges defined above , and were then fit with the cosine function @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting values of the x - ray pulse semi - amplitude @xmath83 are plotted versus the mean count rate @xmath81 in figure 4 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that @xmath83 increases linearly with @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is constant with @xmath81 ) in the middle of the count rate range , but that it saturates at both the low and high ends of the range ; over the full count rate range , @xmath82 is not well fit ( @xmath85 ) by a constant @xmath86 ( dotted line in fig .  4 ) .",
    "instead , @xmath82 versus @xmath81 and @xmath83 versus @xmath81 are well fit by a linear relation @xmath87 with , respectively , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with @xmath90 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "4 ) , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 , with @xmath93 ( solid line in fig .  4 ) .    to determine if the observed spin - phase flux modulation is due to photoelectric absorption ( or some other type of broad - band spectral variability ) , background - subtracted spin - phase count rate light curves were derived from the hetg event data for each of three wavebands defined above : hard ( 18  ) , medium ( 811  ) , and soft ( 1126  ) .",
    "figure 3_b _ shows the ratio of the resulting soft @xmath65 over hard @xmath66 spin - phase count rate light curves .",
    "the data is well fit ( @xmath94 ) by a constant @xmath95 , which strongly constrains the cause of the observed spin - phase flux modulation .",
    "specifically , if the observed flux modulation is caused by photoelectric absorption , a variation in the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath96 is required , whereas the essential constancy of the softness ratio light curves requires @xmath97 ; a factor of 30 times lower .",

    "consider first the systemic velocity of the x - ray emission lines .",

    "although the determination and interpretation of systemic velocities is fraught with uncertainties , the systemic velocity of the x - ray emission lines of ae aqr is consistent with the gravitational redshift from the surface of the white dwarf , and hence with a source on or near the surface of the white dwarf , rather than a more extended region within the binary .    supporting the proposal that the x - ray emission of ae aqr is closely associated with the white dwarf",
    "is the fact , established previously by @xcite , that the x - ray spin pulse follows the motion of the white dwarf around the binary center of mass , producing a time delay @xmath280 s in the arrival times of the x - ray pulses .",
    "given this result , it is somewhat surprising that the radial velocity of the x - ray emission lines does not appear to vary on the white dwarf orbit phase : the measured orbit - phase radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath226 , whereas the expected value @xmath281 ( fig .",
    "the difference between the measured and expected radial velocity semi - amplitudes is @xmath282 , which differs from zero by @xmath283 . while this discrepancy is of some concern , we showed above that the radial velocity of the x - ray emission lines varies on the white dwarf spin phase ( fig .",
    "10_b__d _ ) , which argues strongly for a source of x - rays trapped within , and rotating with , the magnetosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "in contrast , it seems clear that our result for the radial velocity of the x - ray emission lines is not consistent with the proposal , put forward by @xcite , that the accretion stream is the dominant source of x - rays in ae aqr .",

    "although even the observed @xmath11 flux ratio can be produced in a low - density plasma suffering photoexcitation by an external radiation field , this requires both high blackbody temperatures ( @xmath300 kk ) and large dilution factors ( @xmath301 ) , hence small - to - zero distances above the white dwarf surface .",
    "we conclude that , if the bulk of the plasma near the peak of the emission measure distribution is not of high density , it must be in close proximity to the white dwarf .",
    "to investigate the possibility that the x - rays observed in ae aqr are associated with the white dwarf , we considered a simple geometric model , similar to that derived by @xcite from the maximum entropy maps of the uv pulse profiles measured with the faint object spectrograph onboard the _ hubble space telescope_. the model consists of a rotating white dwarf viewed at an inclination angle @xmath302 from the rotation axis @xmath303 with two bright spots , centered @xmath304 above and below the equator and separated in longitude by @xmath305 ( i.e. , the upper and lower spots are centered at spherical coordinates @xmath306=[70^\\circ ,   0^\\circ ] $ ] and @xmath307 $ ] , respectively ) .",
    "such a model naturally produces two unequal flux peaks per spin cycle , with the brighter ( dimmer ) peak occurring when the upper ( lower ) spot is pointed toward the observer . instead of the optically thick assumption applied in the optical and uv",
    ", we assume that the x - ray emitting spots are optically thin . in this case",
    ", the x - ray flux modulation is produced solely by occultation by the body of the white dwarf , so the brightness of the lower spot must be reduced by approximately 30% to avoid producing a second peak in the x - ray light curve .",
    "assuming that the brightness distribution of the spots is given by a gaussian function @xmath308 , where @xmath309 is the polar angle from the center of the spot and the spot width @xmath310 ( hence @xmath311 and the fractional emitting area @xmath312 , justifying our choice for the fiducial value of this quantity in  2.3.2 ) , the light curves of the upper spot , the lower spot , and the total flux are as shown in figure 11_a_. smaller spots produce squarer light curves , while larger spots produce lower relative oscillation amplitudes ; the relative pulse semi - amplitude of the model shown , @xmath313 , is consistent with observations ( fig .",
    "the flux - weighted mean radial velocities of the emission from the upper spot , the lower spot , and the total flux are as shown in figure 11_b _ for an assumed white dwarf rotation velocity @xmath314 .",
    "as observed , the predicted radial velocity of the total flux goes through two oscillations per spin cycle , although the two peaks are not equal in strength , the red - to - blue zero velocity crossings do not occur near @xmath315 and 0.75 , and the maximum velocity amplitude is greater than observed ( fig .",
    "10_b__d _ ) .",
    "although it is possible to remedy these deficiencies by using two bright spots that are more nearly equal in brightness , this significantly reduces the pulse amplitude of the total flux .",
    "furthermore , the model predicts that the width of the x - ray emission lines should be narrower near @xmath260 and 0.5 and broader near @xmath315 and 0.75 , which is not corroborated by the data .",
    "finally , the model predicts that the radial velocity amplitude of the total flux is higher ( lower ) on the 0.751.25 ( 0.250.75 ) spin phase interval , whereas the boot - strapped cross correlation technique provides evidence that this is the case approximately one quarter of a cycle later : on the 00.5 ( 0.51 ) spin phase interval ( ignoring the small phase offset ) .",
    "upper graphic shows a schematic of the model at @xmath316 . ]      to place their results in a theoretical framework , @xcite interpreted the hot spots derived from their maximum entropy maps as the result of reprocessing of x - rays emitted by the post - shock gas in the accretion columns of a magnetic white dwarf . for an assumed point source of illumination , they found good fits to the uv pulse profiles if the angle between the spin axis and the magnetic axis  the magnetic colatitude  @xmath317 , the peak spot temperature @xmath318 kk , the height of the illuminating source above the white dwarf surface @xmath319 , and the x - ray luminosity @xmath320 , where @xmath321 is the efficiency of conversion of accretion luminosity into 0.14 kev x - rays ( note that our fiducial value for this quantity is larger by an order of magnitude than that assumed by eracleous et al .  because the mean temperature of the x - ray spectrum of ae aqr is uncharacteristically low ) .",
    "these results are troubling for two reasons .",
    "first , as noted by eracleous et al . , the shock height required to produce the size of the uv spots is quite large ( comparable to the corotation radius ) .",
    "second , the x - ray luminosity required to heat the 26 kk spots by reprocessing is more than two orders of magnitude greater than observed in the 0.510 kev bandpass .",
    "adding to these problems , we found that such a model reproduces neither the x - ray pulse profile nor the radial velocity variation observed in ae aqr .",
    "first , the predicted pulse profile has a square waveform , with the x - ray flux rapidly doubling ( halving ) when one of the illuminating spots emerges from ( is hidden behind ) the body of the white dwarf .",
    "second ( if the illuminating spots are not equal in brightness ) , the predicted radial velocity variation goes through only one oscillation per spin cycle .    given these problems , we modeled the accretion columns as two uniform emission volumes contained within a polar angle @xmath322 of the magnetic axis and radii @xmath323@xmath324 . for an inclination angle @xmath302 ,",
    "the pulse profiles and radial velocity variations were investigated for magnetic colatitudes @xmath325@xmath326 , opening angles @xmath327@xmath326 , shock heights @xmath3283 , and infall velocities @xmath329@xmath330@xmath331 , with and without intensity weighting by a gaussian function @xmath308 .",
    "although the parameter space is huge , it did not seem possible to reproduce the observed x - ray pulse profile , let alone the radial velocity variation , with such a model , unless it looked very much like the two - spot model discussed in the previous section ( i.e. , @xmath332 , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , and @xmath335 ) : even modest infall velocities produced model radial velocity variations with systematic velocities that are greater ( in absolute magnitude ) than observed , while large shock heights and/or opening angles and/or gaussian widths produced small relative pulse amplitudes , and , for much of the parameter space , flux maximum occurs at spin phases @xmath336 and 0.75 , when both of the accretion columns are visible on the limb of the white dwarf .",
    "we next considered the possibility , argued by @xcite , that the x - ray emission of ae aqr , both persistent and flare , is due to plasma associated with the magnetosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "we assume that the magnetosphere is filled with plasma stripped off of the accretion stream , which , as noted above , makes its closest approach to the white dwarf at a radius @xmath284 cm and a velocity @xmath285 .",
    "the magnetic field of the white dwarf can control the motion of an ionized component of the stream if the magnetic pressure @xmath337 [ where @xmath338 for a dipole field with a surface magnetic field strength @xmath339 is greater than the ram pressure @xmath340 , hence if @xmath341 mg .",
    "if the kinetic energy of the accretion stream is thermalized in a strong shock at its closest approach to the white dwarf , it will be heated to a temperature @xmath342 k or approximately twice the peak temperature of the emission measure distribution .",
    "hence , the magnetosphere plausibly could be the source of x - rays in ae aqr , _ independent of any other source of energy _",
    ", if it is fed at a rate @xmath343 .",
    "the magnetosphere is an attractive source of x - rays in ae aqr in as much as it would naturally supply a range of densities , linear scales , and velocities , as required by the data . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the widths of the x - ray emission lines increase from @xmath344 ev ( @xmath1 ) for to @xmath2 ev ( @xmath3 ) for ( fig .",
    "6 ) , whereas the line widths predicted by this model are nominally much larger : for plasma trapped on , and forced to rotate with , the white dwarf magnetic field , the projected rotation velocity @xmath345 , which varies from @xmath346 for @xmath347 cm ( as in the two - spot model ) to @xmath348 for @xmath349 cm .",
    "however , the observed value for the lines widths should be near the lower end of this range , since , for a magnetosphere uniformly filled with plasma with an inward ( radial ) velocity @xmath350 , the plasma density @xmath351 and the x - ray emissivity @xmath352 .",
    "of the simple models considered above for the source of the x - ray emission of ae aqr , the white dwarf and magnetosphere models are the most promising , while the accretion column model appears to be untenable : it fails to reproduce the _ chandra _  hetg x - ray light curves and radial velocities , and it requires an x - ray luminosity that is more than two orders of magnitude greater than observed in the 0.510 kev bandpass to heat the uv hot spots by reprocessing",
    ". a more intimate association between the x - ray and uv emission regions could resolve this problem , and it is interesting and perhaps important to note that such a situation is naturally produced by a bombardment and/or blobby accretion solution to the accretion flow . in particular , if the cyclotron - balanced bombardment solution applies to ae aqr , it would naturally produce comparable x - ray and uv spot sizes and luminosities , comparable relative pulse amplitudes , comparable orbit - phase pulse time delays , the observed tight correlation between the x - ray and uv light curves @xcite , and an accretion region that is heated to the observed @xmath353 k @xcite .",
    "such a solution to the accretion flow applies if ( 1 ) the specific accretion rate ( @xmath354 ) onto the white dwarf is sufficiently low that the accreting plasma does not pass through a hydrodynamic shock , but instead is stopped by coulomb interactions in the white dwarf atmosphere , and ( 2 ) the magnetic field of the white dwarf is sufficiently strong that the accretion luminosity can be radiated away by a combination of optically thin bremsstrahlung and line radiation in the x - ray waveband and optically thick cyclotron radiation in the infrared and optical wavebands . according to ( * ? ? ? * equating @xmath355 from eqn .",
    "17 with that from eqn .",
    "20 ) , the limit for the validity of cyclotron - balanced bombardment is @xmath356 for a white dwarf mass @xmath357 and magnetic field strength @xmath358 g.    are these conditions satisfied in ae aqr ?",
    "first , assuming that the observed x - ray luminosity is driven by accretion onto the white dwarf , the accretion rate @xmath359 , hence the specific accretion rate @xmath360 .",
    "second , the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf in ae aqr is uncertain , but based on the typical magnetic moments of intermediate polars ( @xmath361 ) and polars ( @xmath362 ) , it should lie in the range @xmath363 .",
    "more specific estimates of this quantity include @xmath364 mg , based on evolutionary considerations @xcite ; @xmath3655 mg , based on the low levels of , and upper limits on , the circular polarization of ae aqr ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the above limit for the validity of cyclotron - balanced bombardment requires @xmath367 mg , which is probably not inconsistent with the circular polarization measurements and upper limits .",
    "conversely , the validity of the bombardment solution in ae aqr could be tested with a more secure measurement of , or lower upper limit on , the magnetic field strength of its white dwarf .    where do we go from here ? additional constraints on the global model of ae aqr , and",
    "in particular on the connection between the various emission regions , can be supplied by simultaneous multiwavelength observations , including those obtained during our 2005 multiwavelength campaign , the analysis of which is at an early stage @xcite .",
    "tev observations with the whipple observatory 10-m telescope obtained over the epoch 19911995 @xcite and the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( magic ) 17-m telescope obtained during our campaign @xcite provide only ( low ) upper limits on the tev @xmath246-ray flux from ae aqr , so it would be useful to unambiguously validate or invalidate earlier reports of detections of tev flux from this source ; in particular , a dedicated high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) campaign of observations , preferably in conjunction with simultaneous x - ray observations , is badly needed .",
    "similarly , it would be useful to independently validate or invalidate the existence of the high - energy emission detected by @xcite in the _ suzaku _ x - ray spectrum of ae aqr , and to establish unambiguously if it is thermal or nonthermal in nature .",
    "going out on a limb , it is our bet that ae aqr is not a tev @xmath368-ray source and that the high - energy x - ray excess is thermal in nature , specifically that it is due to the stand - off shock present when the specific mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf is large ( e.g. , during flares ) and the bombardment solution is no longer valid .",
    "additional high resolution x - ray spectroscopic observations are also warranted , particularly to confirm or refute the high electron densities inferred from the flux ratios of the , , and he @xmath15 triplets ; it is , after all , _ a priori _ unlikely that each of these ratios lies on the knee of the theoretical @xmath11 flux ratio curves , and the trend of increasing density with increasing temperature is opposite to what is expected from a cooling flow ( although it is consistent with the opposite , e.g. , adiabatic expansion ) .",
    "it would be extremely helpful to apply the various fe l - shell density diagnostics @xcite to ae aqr , since they are typically less sensitive to photoexcitation , but the 17.10/17.05 line ratio for one is compromised by blending due to the the large line widths , and the other line ratios all require higher signal - to - noise ratio spectra than currently exists .",
    "it would be extremely useful to ( 1 ) determine the radial velocities of individual x - ray emission lines , rather than all the lines together ; ( 2 ) resolve the individual lines on the white dwarf spin and orbit phases , ( 3 ) investigate the flare and quiescent spectra separately , ( 4 ) resolve individual flares , and ( 5 ) include the fe k lines into this type of analysis .",

    "<S> the nova - like cataclysmic binary ae aqr , which is currently understood to be a former supersoft x - ray binary and current magnetic propeller , was observed for over two binary orbits ( 78 ks ) in 2005 august with the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the long , uninterrupted _ chandra _   observation provides a wealth of details concerning the x - ray emission of ae aqr , many of which are new and unique to the hetg . </S>",
    "<S> first , the x - ray spectrum is that of an optically thin multi - temperature thermal plasma ; the x - ray emission lines are broad , with widths that increase with the line energy , from @xmath0 ev ( @xmath1 ) for to @xmath2 ev ( @xmath3 ) for ; the x - ray spectrum is reasonably well fit by a plasma model with a gaussian emission measure distribution that peaks at @xmath4 , has a width @xmath5 , an fe abundance equal to @xmath6 times solar , and other metal ( primarily ne , mg , and si ) abundances equal to @xmath7 times solar ; and for a distance @xmath8 pc , the total emission measure @xmath9 and the 0.510 kev luminosity @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> second , based on the @xmath11 flux ratios of the forbidden ( @xmath12 ) , intercombination ( @xmath13 ) , and recombination ( @xmath14 ) lines of the he @xmath15 triplets of , , and measured by itoh et al .  in the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer spectrum and those of , , , and in the _ chandra _  hetg spectrum , either the electron density of the plasma increases with temperature by over three orders of magnitude , from @xmath16 for [ @xmath17 to @xmath18 for [ @xmath19 , and/or the plasma is significantly affected by photoexcitation . </S>",
    "<S> third , the radial velocity of the x - ray emission lines varies on the white dwarf spin phase , with two oscillations per spin cycle and an amplitude @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> these results appear to be inconsistent with the recent models of itoh et al . , ikhsanov , and venter & meintjes of an extended , low - density source of x - rays in ae aqr , but instead support earlier models in which the dominant source of x - rays is of high density and/or in close proximity to the white dwarf . </S>"
