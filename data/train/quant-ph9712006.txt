    "it seems generally believed that the einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite proof of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics is wrong because it involved the assumption of locality i.e. , causes can not propagate faster than light @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments , notably those of aspect and his colleagues @xcite , appear to show that nature violates the limits of bell s theorem @xcite and this can only be understood if some details of the detection event at one detector are available at the coincidental detection event at another detector , although the two events have a space - like relation .",
    "unless one abandons the idea of explanation and settles for descriptions of nature , this implies the transmission of influences faster than light .",
    "since the epr proof assumed influences could be isolated , it is apparently wrong .  apparently \" because the proof of the violation of bell s theorem is not quite complete @xcite .",
    "most of these experiments were done using correlations of spins . in this circumstance",
    "it seems reasonable to test whether these conclusions apply to other complementary observable pairs and proposals to do this have been made @xcite",
    ". it might be particularly interesting to look at the complementary pair epr considered , i.e. , momentum and position .",
    "several suggestions have been made for experiments to do this .",
    "maric , popper and vigier @xcite proposed to look at the transverse momenta and positions of annihilation gamma rays .",
    "the experiment though did not have adequate control of the momentum of the annihilation pair so it would only show a @xmath0 product substantially less than @xmath1 in the past .",
    "however , it has been generally thought since the earliest days of the uncertainty principle that in retrodiction @xmath2 can be much less than @xmath1 .",
    "heisenberg @xcite agreed but argued that such calculations do not lead to any predictions so are untestable .",
    "_ @xcite have pointed out that measurements by nuttall and gallon @xcite give a clear example of such a retrodiction , taking advantage of a monatomic layer of argon to get a small @xmath3 .",
    "however , the interaction of every atom with its substate may seriously complicate such experiments .",
    "this suggests it may be best to do such experiments on an isolated excited atom , measuring the momentum of the photon it would emit very precisely and predicting the trajectory of the recoiling atoms very precisely using the einstein - podolsky - rosen scheme .",
    "the recent development of traps for atoms may make such an experiment possible although far from easy .    a quantum mechanical prediction of the dispersion product for this experiment would give a product @xmath4 .",
    "the experiment however is intended as a test of the completeness of quantum mechanics .",
    "if quantum mechanics is incomplete , there may be special circumstances where @xmath5 . to even examine the possibility of a much smaller product ,",
    "a different analysis must be used .",
    "there is little guidance as to what that should be .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , an analysis will be done using the following assumptions ; first , strict conservation of energy and momentum ; second , no retroactive influence ; third , precise knowledge of position and momentum in the past ( retrodiction ) @xcite ; fourth , the semiclassical approximation for the calculation of trajectories @xcite .",
    "tests of these assumptions , which may well be the most useful product of this proposal , are discussed in some detail later .",
    "the general stategy of the proposed experiment is to produce an ensemble of objects whose position and momentum can , using conservation of momentum , be predicted to an accuracy such that the dispersion product of the individual objects would be less than @xmath6/2 and then to test these predictions by measuring the trajectories of these objects with great accuracy .",
    "the experiment could proceed as follows : atoms in a beam of high phase space density , ejected from a trap , are incident in the z direction on a slit , narrow in the x direction , which delimits their x position ( fig .",
    "( in these measurements the horizontal x - dimension is the crucial one .",
    "the effects of motion in the other dimensions are fairly obvious . ) before passing through the slit they encounter an intense light beam in the y direction .",
    "the light is of the right wave length to excite the atom to a state from which it decays in the order of a @xmath7 .",
    "protons in the -x direction are selected by a high resolution spectrometer .",
    "this selection process should make it possible to predict the trajectory of the atom in delayed coincidence with the spectrometer detector using conservation of momentum .",
    "the accuracy of the prediction can be tested by the precision , @xmath8 , with which it predicts the flight time of the atom at the atom detector .",
    "( @xmath9 is the flight time from the emission of the photon to the atoms arrival at the detector . )",
    "the calculation of the dispersion of the flight time uses the assemptions listed .",
    "it starts with the estimation of the dispersion of the initial time , @xmath10 .",
    "this is essentially @xmath11 the duration of the exciting light pulse plus 1/2 the decay time of the excited state",
    ". this should be no greater than @xmath12s at worst .",
    "almost all the uncertainty in the prediction of @xmath13 comes from the trajectory of the atom after emission .",
    "the velocity dispersion is dominated by that due to diffraction at the slit .",
    "the dispersion in the arrival time at the atom detector can be written as    @xmath14 ^{1/2 } \\,.\\ ] ]    here @xmath15 is the distance from the slit to the atom detector , @xmath16 is the atoms x - velocity after going through the slit and emitting the photon , and @xmath17 means the standard deviation or a reasonable approximation to it , e.g.  @xmath18 is taken as 1/4 the slit width .",
    "@xmath3 is a rather complicated matter and the discussion of that will be postponed until some parameters of the apparatus have been discussed . for the present purposes ,",
    "it is enough to say that the term containing @xmath19 is suffiently smaller than the last term that it can be neglected as can @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement of the atom x - velocity is critical .",
    "the photon energy is shifted from that of a motionless free atom by the doppler effect from the motion of the atom .",
    "the spectrometer needs a resolution sufficient to give the atoms x - velocity with an accuracy of about 1/30 of the diffraction - induced motion at the slit . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) we can deduce    @xmath20    this combined with the @xmath3 to be discussed can then be compared with the uncertainty principle value of the dispersion product @xmath1",
    "figure 1 is a sketch of a conceivable arrangement of the apparatus .",
    "illustrative parameters of the appartus are shown in table i. one critical feature is an atomic trap that will give phase space densities of at least @xmath21 atoms @xmath22 ( m / s)@xmath23 . while this is possible , it is not simple @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a real problem in ejecting atoms from the trap which will probably operate in a pulsed mode .",
    "ejection should be by the method that best preserves the phase space density and maximizes ( density ) x ( frequency of ejection ) .",
    "however , these densities are high enough that , if they can be exploited , counting rates should not be a fatal problem",
    ".    the atoms in the trap should be alkali , since there is considerable experience in trapping them and even neutral alkali atoms are relatively easy to detect .",
    "after extraction from the trap , the atoms would be radiated by a laser of the appropriate frequency and power to lift them to a state of a lifetime of at least 0.1 @xmath7 .",
    "the demands on the laser are not severe .",
    "it needs about 1 watt of power focussed on 10@xmath24 m@xmath25 .",
    "it would be pulsed in near synchronism with the ejection of atoms from the trap , for 10@xmath26 seconds , perhaps 100 times a second .",
    "the focusing of the laser beam will give the photons small components in the x - direction which will be transformed to the momentum of the atoms .",
    "if there is a @xmath27 = 0.05 radians spread in the x - direction , the velocity spread induced in the atoms would be    @xmath28    this is negligible compared to the dispersion from diffraction in the slit .    the neutral atoms would be detected at @xmath9 by a surface ionization detector , essentially a flat plate of hot rhenium perpendicular to the x - direction to within 10@xmath29 rad .",
    "when the atoms are ionized they are attracted to a microchannel plate . because the intrinsic z - velocity of the atoms from the trap should be @xmath30 10 m / s they would be well away from the slit in the z direction when detected .",
    "this should make it relatively easy to move the ions , in a uniform way , by an electric field pulling them into the microchannel plate with negligible variance in the time delay for all the atoms involved in the experiment . because the velocity of the accelerated ions is relatively high",
    ", the flatness and alignment of the microchannel array is not of major concern .",
    "the channels would all be connected in parallel .",
    "@xmath31 appears to be the best alkali to use because it minimizes the needed resolution of the spectrometer .",
    "the desorption time is of some concern here but with rhenium at 1400 k , @xmath32 should desorb in @xmath33 s @xcite .",
    "it would be of a modest help to use separated @xmath34 but since @xmath35 is only 7.5% of @xmath32 , it would at worst be a small addition to background .",
    "a suitable spectrum line from @xmath32 is ( 1s)@xmath25 @xmath36 ground state ( 323 nm and a lifetime of 0.8 @xmath37 10@xmath29 s ) .",
    "this would give a recoil velocity of 0.12 m / s .",
    "the lifetime gives a spread of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the photon energy ) of 1.4 @xmath37 10@xmath40 .",
    "this limits the useful resolution of the spectrometer to 7 @xmath37 10@xmath41 .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath9 is increased by the motion of the atom after it passes the slit .",
    "the dispersion in the x - velocity of the atom @xmath42 will lead to a dispersion in x of about @xmath43 , where @xmath9 is the time after the atom passes the slit .",
    "the spectral line used in this experiment must be fairly narrow or @xmath44 will be larger than the spread coming from the doppler shift of the x motion .",
    "this means excited state lifetimes of @xmath45 10@xmath29 s. such times would lead to an unacceptably large @xmath3 ( from the diffraction induced velocity ) .",
    "this can be remedied by putting the exciting beam , which moves in the - direction , between the atom trap and the slit and screening all but a few microns past the slit from the spectrometer .",
    "the consequent spread in x can thus be held to less than the slit width .",
    "there is obviously a cost for this in counting rate but it appears to be necessary .",
    "the x - dispersion from the slit shown in fig .",
    "1 should be about 0.5 @xmath37 10@xmath46 m .",
    "the dispersion of the x - position of the detector plate is taken as the same .",
    "these two folded together and with the @xmath3 from the diffractive spreading give a final @xmath3 of 1.0 @xmath37 10@xmath46 m .",
    "this width of the defining slit is very narrow and there is possible danger of it being narrowed further by accummulation of @xmath32 atoms .",
    "this could be inhibited by raising the temperatures of the slit .",
    "the spectrometer with which one infers the recoil x - velocity of the atoms by the doppler shift in the photons they emitted must have a very high resolution . in the illustrative example",
    "being given @xmath47 is taken as 7 @xmath37 10@xmath41 .",
    "there are fabry - perot cavity spectrometers of this resolution commercially available [ newport corporation super - cavity optical spectrum analyzers ] , but not yet for wave lengths as short as 323 nm .",
    "achieving the desired resolution will surely be one of the most difficult parts of this experiment .",
    "it should be pointed out that a possible solution to this problem is a spectrometer using a considerably longer fabry - perot cavity than the commercial one ( 2.5 cm ) .",
    "this would need fewer reflections than the shorter one , and might be practical in the near uv .",
    "alternatively , this long cavity might give a resolution in the visible high enough to make it possible to use a visible line from sodium.@xcite    the parameters of the experiment then are given in table i. given these parameters @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( 2 ) is 5 @xmath37 10@xmath49 m / s , the mass of the @xmath50 atom is 1.6 @xmath37 10@xmath51 kg , then @xmath52 .",
    "the conservation of momentum in atom - photon interactions has been tested well enough for the suggested dispersion product measurement ( about @xmath53 m / s ) by an experiment done by weiss , young and chu @xcite .",
    "they use atomic interferometry in an experiment where the ultimate aim was a precision measurement of the fine structure constant and they show momentum conservation to @xmath54 10@xmath55 m / s in photon interactions with @xmath56 atoms .",
    "the combination of retroactive influences and failure of retrodiction , i.e.  the failure of the second and third assumptions could lead to an arbitrary increase in the dispersion product .",
    "for example , if the detection time of the photon detector were of the order of picoseconds and the time - energy uncertainty principle applied , then the resolution of the photon spectrometer would be badly degraded , i.e.  a failure of precise retrodiction .",
    "if retroactive influence were allowed , this in turn could affect the selection of the momentum of the atom and that could produce a dispersion product @xmath4 .",
    "note that it would take a failure of both assumptions to do this .",
    "the validity of this analysis could be tested by dispersing the detector times which could sharpen the energy resolution .",
    "if the preceding two assumptions pass the test , the last assumption , the semiclassical approximation , may be inapplicable .",
    "this is almost equivalent to saying that the uncertainty relation is an absolute and at least at the present stage of knowledge is not to be questioned , but simply accepted as a foundation of physics .",
    "this is probably right but there is some obligation to continue testing foundations .",
    "this is not , however , work for people concerned with tenure .",
    "the bose - enstein condensation experiments give very high phase space densities , 10@xmath57 atoms @xmath22 ( m / s)@xmath23 and higher . specifically c.c . bradley _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite appear to have a phase space density of 2 @xmath37 10@xmath57 @xmath32 atoms , @xmath22 ( m / s)@xmath23 at a temperature of 100 nk . in the experiment",
    "being described in the present paper , the geometric volume per second passing would be given by the slit width in x , 10@xmath29 cm , the slit length in y , 10@xmath49 cm and the beam length in 1 sec for the z dimension .",
    "this last could be 100 pulses / s @xmath37 10@xmath49 cm ( @xmath30 diameter of the atomic cloud in the trap ) , i.e. 1 cm .",
    "this gives a volume of 2 @xmath37 10@xmath46 @xmath58 .",
    "the velocity corresponding to @xmath32 at 100 nk is 1.1 @xmath37 10@xmath49 m / s and is fully usable in the y and z directions , but only 1/30 is usable in the x direction because of the diffraction in that direction , so only 3 @xmath37 10@xmath29 ( m / s)@xmath59 velocity space is filled .",
    "there is a loss from spreading of the atomic beam from the trap to the slit estimated to take 0.02 seconds .",
    "the reduction of the density should be about a factor of 3 .",
    "the spectrometer accepts only @xmath60 of the sphere of photons emitted is negligible .",
    "the maximum angle from the x axis is 2.7 @xmath37 10@xmath49 and the loss in velocity , this causes 3.1 @xmath37 10@xmath61 m / s which is to be compared with @xmath62 = 5 @xmath37 10@xmath49 m / s . ] and might well lose a factor of 3 or more in passing through it .",
    "the selection of a narrow part of the decay curve could lose about a factor of 10 .",
    "the atom drifts about one lifetime ( 0.8 @xmath63sec @xmath64 10@xmath26 m/10 m / s ) and then is open toward the spectrometer for 2.10@xmath29 m which corresponds to 0.2 lifetimes .",
    "inefficiences in detectors and miscellaneous losses could be another factor of 10 .",
    "inefficiences in the excitation process and the two detectors could be still another factor of 10 .",
    "all this leads to about 1/10 photon counted / min .",
    "this could be adequate if the background were small .",
    "it should be .",
    "the most serious source of background should be scattering of light from the exciting laser on stationary objects",
    ". this would however be a very sharp line which could be avoided in the spectrometer by setting the spectrometer at a line corresponding to , say a 0.5 m / s doppler shift .",
    "moreover , scattering in general would not be in coincidence with the detection of an atom .",
    "this is clearly a very difficult experiment but the difficulties are in technical matters not in fundamental physics and should lessen with time given the role of such active fields as atom trapping and laser spectroscopy .",
