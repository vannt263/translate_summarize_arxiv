    "since about ten years when the idea of a possible existence of @xmath0 condensate type of states in @xmath1 nuclei was advanced and formulated for the first time @xcite , many exciting new results , theoretical and experimental ones , have been produced . in this contribution , we would like to assess where we stand and what possible future extensions may be .",
    "let us start with the reminder that nuclear clustering and in particular @xmath0 clustering would not exist , if we did not have in nuclear physics _",
    "four _ different types of fermions ( proton / neutron  spin up / down ) , all attracting one another",
    ". we should be aware of the fact that this is a rather singular situation in fermionic many body systems .",
    "however , the possibility of future trapping of four different kinds of cold fermionic atoms , may open a new field of cluster physics with similar features as in nuclei . in a mean field description of an isolated @xmath0 particle ( what with , e.g.",
    ", skyrme forces gives reasonable results , if the c.o.m .",
    "motion is treated correctly ) the four fermions can occupy the lowest 0s - level . would there be only neutrons",
    ", only two of them can be in the 0s - level , the other two neutrons would have to be in the energetically very penalising 0p - state .",
    "that is why @xmath0 particles exist , tetra - neutrons not .",
    "the ensuing fact is that @xmath0 particles are very strongly bound ( @xmath2 7 mev ) , almost as strong as the most bound nucleus which is @xmath3fe ( @xmath2 8 mev ) .",
    "in addition the first excited state of the @xmath0 particle ( @xmath4 20 mev ) is by factors higher than that of any other nucleus .",
    "the @xmath0 particle can , therefore , be considered as an almost inert ideal bosonic particle . as we will see in the discussion below , inspite of its strong binding",
    ", @xmath0 particle condensation can only exist in the so - called bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) phase what implies low density .",
    "there is no analogue to the bcs phase of pairing where the cooper pairs can have very large extensions , strongly overlapping with one another , still being fully antisymmetrised .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath0 condensation only can be present at low densities where the @xmath0 particles do not overlap strongly ( this holds , if the system consists of protons and neutrons and @xmath0 s . if other clusters as t , @xmath5he , d are around , the situation may change , see below ) .",
    "these considerations apply for nuclear matter as well as for finite nuclei .",
    "the hoyle state in @xmath6c which can to a good approximation be described as a product of three @xmath0 particles occupying all the lowest 0s state of their bosonic mean field has a density which is by a factor 3 - 4 lower than the one of the ground state of @xmath6c . in the ground state there exist @xmath0-type of correlations but there is no condensation phenomenon .",
    "let us start our considerations with infinite matter .",
    "the in medium four - body equation can be written in the following form    @xmath7    in total , there are six terms coming from permutations .",
    "the @xmath8 are kinetic energies plus mean field corrections ; @xmath9 are the matrixelements of the two body interaction , and @xmath10 is a fermi - dirac distribution of the uncorrelated nucleons accounting for phase space blocking .",
    "repeated indices are summed over and index numbers comprise momenta and spins .",
    "the above equation considers , therefore , _",
    "one _ quartet in a gas of uncorrelated nucleons at temperature @xmath11 . the analogous two body equation can be used to determine the critical temperature @xmath12 for the onset of superfluidity or supraconductivity where @xmath12 has to be determined so that the eigenvalue comes at two times the chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "this is the famous thouless criterion of bcs theory . in analogy with pairing",
    ", one has to find the critical temperature @xmath14 so that the eigenvalue of the four body equation ( 1 ) comes at @xmath15 .",
    "the in medium four body equation is very difficult to solve .",
    "nontheless , the solution has been found employing the faddeev - yakubovsky equations and using the malfliet - tjohn bare nucleon - nucleon interaction which yields realistic nucleon - nucleon phase shifts and properties of an isolated @xmath0 particle @xcite . to simplify the problem",
    ", we made in addition a very easy to handle variational ansatz of the four body wave function in ( 1 ) .",
    "it consists of a mean field ansatz for the @xmath0 particle projected on good total momentum . in momentum space",
    "this is    @xmath16    inserting this ansatz into ( 1 ) , one obtains a nonlinear hf - type of equation for the s - wave function @xmath17 .",
    "of course , for quartet condensation , we choose @xmath18 . with the mean field ansatz ( 2 )",
    ", one can not use a bare force .",
    "we adjusted an effective separable force with two parameters which are chosen to reproduce binding energy and radius of the free @xmath0 particle .",
    "the full faddeev - yakubovsky solution of ( 1 ) is shown for symmetric and asymmetric matter in fig .",
    "1 ( crosses ) .",
    "particle and deuteron condensation in symmetric nuclear matter as a function of @xmath13 ( a ) and density @xmath19 ( b).,width=245 ]    we see that the ansatz ( 2 ) which very much eases the otherwise difficult solution of ( 1 ) works very well ( continuous line ) .",
    "also shown is the critical temperature for deuteron condensation .",
    "the striking feature is that @xmath0 particle condensation abruptly breaks down already at very low density which approximately coincides with the point where the @xmath0 s start to overlap appreciately ( this fact was already found in @xcite using a somewhat different variational ansatz for @xmath20 ) . on",
    "the other hand deuteron condensation goes on up to very high densities and the limit is only triggered by the range of the effective force ( which has been readjusted to reproduce the deuteron properties ) .",
    "this is so for symmetric nuclear matter . for strong asymmetry ,",
    "deuteron condensation breaks down earlier than @xmath0 condensation because the @xmath0 particle according to its much stronger binding is less sensitive to asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this is the afore mentioned phenomenon that @xmath0 condensation only exists in the bec phase , i.e. , at low density , whereas deuteron continuously goes from negative to positive chemical potentials where for the latter the deuterons turn into large size cooper pairs .",
    "more on this can be found in @xcite @xcite . we should mention that our calculation of @xmath14 is only reliable rather close to the break down point . for lower densities",
    ", the @xmath14 should join the one for condensation of ideal bosons ( @xmath0 s ) . to describe this feature",
    ", one should extend our theory to the so - called nozires schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory @xcite for pairing , see also @xcite , to @xmath0 particle condensation .",
    "this , however , has not been worked out so far and remains a task for the future .    at zero temperature",
    ", there are many @xmath0 s which go into the condensate phase . for this",
    ", we have to set up an approach analogous to the nonlinear bcs theory .",
    "equation ( 1 ) corresponds to the linearised version and only describes _",
    "one _ @xmath0 particle in an otherwise uncorrelated gas ( at finite @xmath11 ) of fermions . in finite nuclei",
    ", there may exist such a situation even at zero temperature .",
    "this is the case of @xmath21po which can to a certain extent be viewed as an @xmath0 particle sitting on top of the doubly magic core of @xmath22pb which can be well described by a hf - mean field approach , i.e. a fermi gas in a container .",
    "we will come back to this later when we discuss finite nuclei .",
    "after having considered the linearised version of the equation for the quartet order parameter at the critical temperature , let us now try to write down , in analogy to the bcs case , the fully non - linear system of equations for the quartet order parameter . to clearly see the analogy to the bcs case ,",
    "let us repeat the latter equations in a slightly unusual way .",
    "the pairing order parameter allowing for non - zero c.o.m .",
    "momentum of the pairs , reads    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the usual pairing tensor ( with spin indices suppressed ) and @xmath26 are the bcs occupation numbers .",
    "the @xmath27 s are , as before , the kinetic energies , eventually including a mean field correction .",
    "the occupation numbers can be obtained from the dyson equation    @xmath28    the bcs mass operator where @xmath29 is the diagonal part of the gap for cases where the pairs are at rest . from the single particle green s function , obviously we can calculate the occupation numbers closing , thus , the typical bcs selfconsistency cycle .",
    "inspired by the bcs case , we then write for the quartet order parameter , see ( 1 )    @xmath30    with @xmath31 .",
    "again , we have to close the equation with the dyson equation for the occupation numbers .",
    "however , the massoperator now contains the quartet order parameter @xmath32 \\delta^*_{1234}}{\\omega + \\varepsilon_2+\\varepsilon_3+\\varepsilon_4}\\delta({\\bf k}_1 + { \\bf k}_2 + { \\bf k}_3 + { \\bf k}_4)\\ ] ]    with @xmath33 and @xmath34 being the uncorrelated fermi function , i.e. , the fermi step and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an effective coupling vertex linking the single particle motion to the order parameter ( for more details and derivation , see @xcite ) . before trying to solve this equation ,",
    "let us discuss the differences between the pairing and the quartet case .",
    "the first thing which strikes is that the three holes only have to have total momentum @xmath37 and , therefore , we have a remaining sum over momenta . in the pairing case with only one hole , there is no sum .",
    "furthermore in the pairing case the hole propagator has no phase space factor because forward and backward going parts add up to one : @xmath38 . in the quartet case",
    "there are three hole propagators and the corresponding sum of phase space factors does not add up to one , i.e. @xmath39 ! !",
    "this makes a dramatic difference with the pairing case . in order to understand this a little better ,",
    "let us compare the level density of a single hole with the one of three holes : @xmath40\\delta(\\omega+\\varepsilon_k ) = \\sum_k \\delta(\\omega+\\varepsilon_k)\\ ] ]    @xmath41\\delta(\\omega+\\varepsilon_{k_1}+ \\varepsilon_{k_2}+\\varepsilon_{k_3})\\ ] ]    the 3h level density is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we see that for positive @xmath13 there is a striking difference with the 1h level density . at positive",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath42 is obviously finite ( not shown ) , whereas @xmath43 goes through zero .",
    "this is because phase space constraints and energy conservation can not be fullfilled simultaneously at the fermi surface in the latter case as is easily verified .",
    "that is , in the quartet case , exactly at the point where the correlations should be built up , namely at the fermi - level , there is no level density ! as a consequence ,",
    "no quartet condensation is possible for positive @xmath13 . on the contrary for negative @xmath13 , @xmath44 and ,",
    "thus , the phase space factor in the case of @xmath45 is also equal to one and then there is no qualitative difference with the @xmath46 case .",
    "this explains in a natural way why quartet condensation is not possible at positive chemical potential .",
    "it is by the way well known that any @xmath47 level density , besides the single particle case , goes through zero at the fermi level .",
    "for example , the origin of fermions at the fermi energy having an infinite free mean path stems from the fact that the 2p-1h ( 2h-1p ) level density is zero at the fermi level what is the equivalent to the imaginary part of the optical potential being zero at that energy .",
    "also the 2p-2h level density which plays an important role for the damping of zero sound modes is zero at zero frequency .",
    "as first pointed out by landau , it approaches zero as @xmath48 . in conclusion for positive @xmath13 only pairing survives whereas quartetting breaks down and only exists in the bec phase with negative @xmath13 .",
    "the situation may be different when other light clusters are present , i.e. in a mixed gas of , e.g. , nucleons , tritons ( @xmath49he ) , deuterons .",
    "then a nucleon with momentum @xmath50 may , eventually , directly pair with , e.g. , a triton of momentum @xmath51 ( or the other way round ) , rather similar to the standard pairing situation besides the fact that now two fermions with different masses have to pair up .",
    "similar considerations hold for the pairing of two deuterons ( pairing of bosons ) . in compact star physics",
    "such situations may exist when the star is cooling down .",
    "the extension of our theory to this scenario is a task for the future .",
    "the full solution of the nonlinear set of equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) is again very much eased in taking for the order parameter the factorisation ansatz ( 2 ) .",
    "the most interesting result is that the occupation numbers , e.g .",
    ", for @xmath13 around zero is far from being close to saturation .",
    "at @xmath52 it is only approximately @xmath53 .",
    "this scenario is analogous to pairing in the bec regime .",
    "more results can be found in @xcite .",
    "as we know from pairing , a direct observation of condensation phenomena only is possible in finite nuclei . of course ,",
    "in such small systems , there can not exist a condensation in the macroscopic sense .",
    "nevertheless , as we know very well , only a handfull of cooper pairs suffices to show clear signatures of pairing in nuclei . for @xmath0 particle condensation",
    "it is the same story .",
    "we also only can expect that there exists about a handfull of @xmath0 particles , essentially in lighter @xmath1 nuclei , in a gaseous phase at low density .",
    "it is , indeed , surprising that such states at low density with about @xmath54 with @xmath55 the density at saturation , indeed exist as excited quite long lived states in those nuclei .",
    "the most fameous example is the hoyle state in @xmath6c at 7.65 mev , just about 300 kev above the 3@xmath0 threshold .",
    "we will not dwell much on the successful theoretical description of this state ( and others , e.g .",
    ", in @xmath56o ) with the thsr wave function @xcite , since this has been presented in the recent literature a great number of times @xcite .",
    "let us only make a couple of remarks .",
    "the thsr wave function is schematically written for a finite number of quartets as    @xmath57\\ ] ]    where the single @xmath0 wave function @xmath58 depends on four spatial coordinates , the spin - isospin part being suppressed .",
    "this wave function is fully antisymmetric due to the antisymmetriser @xmath59 and is analogous to the number projected bcs wave function    @xmath60\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the cooper pair wave function depending on two spatial coordinates .",
    "the calculus with the @xmath0 condensate wave function is very much facilitated with a variational ansatz where @xmath58 is split into a product of a c.o.m .",
    "gaussian with a large width parameter @xmath62 times another , intrinsic , gaussian depending only on the relative coordinates of the @xmath0 particle and having a width parameter @xmath63 which corresponds to the size of an isolated @xmath0 particle .",
    "the first important remark to be made is that this thsr wave function contains two important limits : if @xmath64 then it corresponds to a pure harmonic oscillator slater determinant .",
    "if @xmath65 , then the @xmath0 s are so distant from one another that the pauli principle among the different @xmath0 s can be neglected and , thus , the antisymmetriser be dropped .",
    "the thsr wave function is then a pure product state of @xmath0 particles , i.e. , a condensate state of ideal bosons .",
    "reality is , of course , in between those limits and one important task is to find out whether reality is closer to a slater determinant or to a bose condensate . that this question must be carefully investigated , can also be deduced from the fact that a number projected bcs wave function always leads to a non trivial pairing solution .",
    "for example for @xmath22pb , one obtains a non trivial bcs solution inspite of the fact that @xmath22pb is certainly not superfluid .",
    "only when the original particle number breaking bcs theory with @xmath66 has a non - trivial solution , we can speek of a superfluid nucleus .",
    "for @xmath22pb there is no such solution .",
    "one way to analyse whether the thsr approach leads primarily to an @xmath0 condensate or to a slater determinant , is to investigate the bosonic occupation numbers .",
    "an ideal fermi gas has occupation numbers which are one or zero . in an ideal bose condensate",
    "the bosons will occupy the lowest single particle state with 100 @xmath67 .",
    "of course , in real nuclei , neither the fermionic occupation numbers nor the bosonic occupations are the ones of an ideal gas . for nucleons ,",
    "we know that occupation numbers are around 70 - 80% down from unity . for the @xmath0 occupations in the condensate , we also have found a number around 70% , all the other occupancies being down by at least a factor of ten , whereas for the ground state the occupation numbers are almost equally distributed according to the su3 shell model scheme @xcite .",
    "this is a typical condensate situation , though not totally the one of an ideal condensate .",
    "residual antisymmetry effects between the slightly overlapping @xmath0 particles makes that with a certain probability the @xmath0 s are scattered out of the condensate .",
    "in addition there are also other correlations at work .",
    "one of the most important one is certainly the formation of @xmath68be clusters out of two @xmath0 s .",
    "it is even not clear whether an @xmath0 gas does not in reality consist out of a gas of @xmath68be s .",
    "the latter are , of course also bosons and the old question arises whether in an attractive bose gas the bosons condensate as singles or as molecules @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a very interesting question which desserves further studies in the future .",
    "many other extensions of @xmath0 condensation are presently discussed theoretically and experimentally .",
    "an intersting aspect is whether on top of the @xmath0 condensate states excited @xmath0 gas states exist .",
    "a long debate has recently been closed about the nature and existence of the second @xmath69 state close to 10 mev excitation energy in @xmath6c .",
    "very nice experimental results by m. freer , m. itoh , and m. gai have recently shown that this state is there and that it is part of a family of @xmath0 gas states @xcite@xcite .",
    "many more results , for instance , in @xmath56o are to be expected .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects is that one may be able to dismantle @xmath1 nuclei with @xmath70 a rather large number like @xmath71 or more into @xmath70 @xmath0 particles .",
    "first results in this direction have been reported at this conference with @xmath3ni , i.e. a nucleus with 14 @xmath0 particles by h. akimune",
    ". a dream would be that all @xmath0 particles be just excited to the ikeda threshold and then they disintegrate in a very slow motion as a kind of coherent state driven by the coulomb force , i.e. , it would be some kind of soft coulomb explosion .",
    "this would then be rather close to what happens with a trapped bose condensate of cold atoms upon switching off the trapping potential .",
    "other exciting perspectives are that @xmath0 particles could exist in a gaseous phase on top of an inert core .",
    "for example four @xmath0 s on top of @xmath56o in @xmath72s , or other variants , even in quite heavy nuclei .",
    "because of space restrictions , we , unfortunately , can not extend further on these exciting aspects of @xmath0 gas type of states in nuclei .    before closing",
    ", we would like to discuss , however , the question of a possible preformation of @xmath0 particles in heavy nuclei . as well known",
    ", this question is of great importance fo the description of @xmath0 decay rates .",
    "let us take the example already alluded to in the infinite matter section , namely @xmath21po . since the lead core is doubly magic , one can treat it in mean field , i.e. as a slater determinant with a suitable skyrme or gogny type of force .",
    "that is we may view @xmath21po as an @xmath0 particle on top of a finite fermi gas . if such a configuration exists , and the @xmath0 decay rate of @xmath21po suggests that , it is clear from our experience with the hoyle state that such a cluster state can not be described within the shell model alone , see @xcite @xcite . in the infinite matter section ,",
    "we have already considered a situation where a single @xmath0 particle is imbedded in an uncorrelated fermi gas .",
    "this was the case with respect to the critical temperature .",
    "for @xmath21po we can consider our treatment of the single @xmath0 case even at zero temperature .",
    "of course we can not use the ansatz ( 2 ) as is , since it corresponds to a c.o.m .",
    "wave function which is a plane wave @xmath73 . in position space",
    "( 2 ) namely reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the intrinsic wave function depending only on the relative coordinates . in a finite nucleus , instead of the plane wave",
    ", one would have to use a wave packet considering the following wave function    @xmath76    where @xmath75 and @xmath77 are to be determined variationally upon inserting ( 12 ) into eq ( 1 ) where all indices and ingredients correspond now to the mean field of @xmath22pb .",
    "for instance the @xmath8 correspond to the hf energies and the @xmath10 are to be replaced by the hf occupation numbers at @xmath78 .",
    "in addition for the @xmath75 , one could use , as for the study of the hoyle state , a gaussian wave function with the width parameter @xmath63 .",
    "then the single unknown would be the spherical wave function @xmath79 to be determined variationally where @xmath80 is the c.o.m .",
    "coordinate of the @xmath0 with respect to the center of the pb core . our knowledge",
    "that @xmath0 s only can exist at very low density incites us to believe that this @xmath77 wave function should be peaked rather far out in the surface of the pb nucleus .",
    "if true , this would be a nice explanation of a preformed @xmath0 particle in the nuclear surface .",
    "adding more than one @xmath0 to the pb core may suggest that there could exist some sort of @xmath0 condensate in the surface in a fluctuating state .",
    "however , as we know , adding more @xmath0 s to the pb core leads to deformed nuclei and the treatment of @xmath0 s in the surface becomes a much more delicate subject .",
    "as we have seen , the existence of @xmath0 gas and @xmath0 condensate states in nuclear systems where the @xmath0 s play practically the role of elementary bosons , is fascinating .",
    "nuclear physics is at the forefront of this kind of physics . in the future",
    ", experiments with cold atoms trapping four ( or more ) different kinds of fermions may also open wide perspectives in the field of cluster physics . for more reading on @xmath0 cluster states , we invite the reader to consult our review article @xcite .",
