    "in the last section `` why is the tangent space a group ? '' ( section 8) of the article by a. bellache , the tangent space in sub - riemannian geometry , the author explains a very interesting story , where names of gromov and connes appear , which is the first place , to my knowledge , where the idea of http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1520[emergent algebras ] appear .",
    "let me give the relevant passages .",
    "[ p. 73 ] \" why is the tangent space a group at regular points ? [ ... ]",
    "i have been puzzled by this question . drawing",
    "a lie algebra from the bracket structure of some @xmath0 s did not seem to me the appropriate answer .",
    "i remember having , at last , asked m. gromov about it ( 1982 ) .",
    "the answer came under the form of a little apologue :    take a map @xmath1 .",
    "define its differential as    @xmath2\\ ] ]    provided convergence holds .",
    "then @xmath3 is certainly homogeneous :    @xmath4    but it need not satisfy the additivity condition    @xmath5    [ ... ] however , if the convergence in ( 79 ) is uniform on some neghbourhood of @xmath6 [ ... ] then @xmath3 is additive , hence linear .",
    "so , uniformity was the key .",
    "the tangent space at @xmath7 is a limit , in the [ gromov-]hausdorff sense , of pointed spaces [ ... ] it certainly is a homogeneous space  in the sense of a metric space having a 1-parameter group of dilations .",
    "but when the convergence is uniform with respect to @xmath7 , which is the case near regular points , in addition , it is a group .    before giving the proof ,",
    "i want to tell of another , later , hint , coming from the work of a. connes .",
    "he has made significant use of the following observation : the tangent bundle @xmath8 to a differentiable manifold @xmath9 is , like @xmath10 , a groupoid .",
    "[ ... ] in fact tm is simply a union of groups . in [ 8 ] , ii.5",
    ", it is stated that its structure may be derived from that of @xmath10 by blowing up the diagonal in @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that , putting metrics back into the picture , one should have    @xmath11    [ ... ] in some sense to be made precise .",
    "there is still one question .",
    "since the differentiable structure of our manifold is the same as in connes picture , why do we not get the same abelian group structure ?",
    "one can answer : the differentiable structure is strongly connected to ( the equivalence class of ) riemannian metrics ; differentiable maps are locally lipschitz , and lipschitz maps are almost everywhere differentiable .",
    "there is no such connection between differentiable maps and the metric when it is sub - riemannian . put in another way ,",
    "differentiable maps have good local commutation properties with ordinary dilations , but not with sub - riemannian dilations @xmath12 .",
    "so , one should not be abused by ( 83 ) and think that the algebraic structure of @xmath13 stems from the absolutely trivial structure of @xmath10 ! it is concealed in dilations , as we shall now prove . _ \"",
    "in this section we shall see how bellache proposes to extract the algebraic structure of the metric tangent space @xmath13 at a point @xmath14 , where @xmath9 is a regular sub - riemannian manifold .",
    "the metric tangent space is defined up to arbitrary isometries fixing one point , as the limit in the gromov - hausdorff topology over isometry classes of compact pointed metric spaces    @xmath15 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0 } [ \\bar{b}(p , \\varepsilon ) , \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon } d , p]\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 $ ] is the isometry class of the compact metric space @xmath17 with a marked point @xmath18 .",
    "( bellache s notation is less precise but his previous explanations clarify that his relations ( 83 ) , ( 84 ) are meaning exactly what i have written above ) .",
    "a very important point is that moreover , this convergence is uniform with respect to the point @xmath14 . according to gromov s hint mentioned by bellache , this is the central point of the matter . by using this and the structure of the trivial pair groupoid @xmath10 , bellache proposes to recover the carnot group algebraic structure of @xmath13 .    from this point on",
    "i shall pass to a personal interpretation of the section 8.2 `` a purely metric derivation of the group structure in @xmath13 for regular @xmath7 '' of bellache article .",
    "( we do nt have to worry about `` regular '' points because i already supposed that the manifold is `` regular '' , although bellache s results are more general , in the sense that they apply also to sub - riemannian manifolds which are not regular , like the grushin plane . )    in order to exploit the limit in the sense of gromov - hausdorff , he needs first an embodiment of the abstract isometry classes of pointed metric spaces .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath19 ( but sufficiently small ) , he uses a function denoted by @xmath20 , which he states that it is defined on @xmath21 with values in @xmath9 . but",
    "doing so would be contradictory with the goal of constructing the tangent space from the structure of the trivial pair groupoid and dilations . for the moment",
    "there is no intrinsic meaning of @xmath21 , although there is one from differential geometry , which we are not allowed to use , because it is not intrinsic to the problem .",
    "nevertheless , bellache already has the functions @xmath20 , by way of his lengthy proof ( but up to date the best proof ) of the existence of adapted coordinates . for a detailed discussion",
    "see my article `` dilatation structures in sub - riemannian geometry '' http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.4298[arxiv:0708.4298 ] .",
    "moreover , later he mentions `` dilations '' , but which ones ? the natural dilations he has from the vector space structure of the tangent space in the usual differential geometric sense ?",
    "this would have no meaning , when compared to his assertion that the structure of a carnot group of the metric tangent space is concealed in dilations .",
    "the correct choice is again to use his adapted coordinate systems and use intrinsic dilations . in fewer words ,",
    "what bellache probably means is that his functions @xmath20 are also decorated with the scale parameter @xmath22 , so they should deserve the better notation @xmath23 , and that these functions behave like dilations .",
    "a natural alternative to bellache s proposal would be to use an embodiment of the isometry class @xmath24 $ ] on the space @xmath9 , instead of the differential geometric tangent space @xmath25 . with this choice",
    ", what bellache is saying is that we should consider dilation like functions @xmath26 defined locally from @xmath9 to @xmath9 such that :    1 .",
    "they preserve the point @xmath27 ( which will become the `` @xmath28 '' of the metric tangent space ) : @xmath29 2 .",
    "they form a one - parameter group with respect to the scale : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , 3 .   for any @xmath32 at a finite distance from @xmath27 ( measured with the sub - riemannian distance @xmath33 , more specifically such that @xmath34 ) we have    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is uniform w.r.t .",
    "( does not depend on ) @xmath37 in compact sets .    moreover , we have to keep in mind that the `` dilation '' @xmath26 is defined only locally , so we have to avoid to go far from @xmath27 , for example we have to avoid to apply the dilation for @xmath38 very big to points at finite distance from @xmath27 .",
    "again , the main thing to keep in mind is the uniformity assumption .",
    "the choice of the embodiment provided by `` dilations '' is not essential , we may take them otherwise as we please , with the condition that at the limit @xmath39 certain combinations of dilations converge uniformly .",
    "this idea suggested by bellache reflects the hint by gromov .",
    "in fact this is what is left from the idea of a manifold in the realm of sub - riemannian geometry ( because adapted coordinates can not be used for building manifold structures , due to the fact that `` local '' and `` infinitesimal '' are not the same in sub - riemannian geometry , a thing rather easy to misunderstand until you get used to it ) .",
    "let me come back to bellache reasoning , in the setting i just explained .",
    "his purpose is to construct the operation in the tangent space , i.e. the addition of vectors . only that the addition has to recover the structure of a carnot group , as proven by bellache",
    "this means that the addition is not a commutative , but a noncommutative nilpotent operation .",
    "ok , so we have the base point @xmath40 and two near points @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which are fixed .",
    "the problem is how to construct an intrinsic addition of @xmath41 and @xmath42 with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath43 the result we are seeking .",
    "( the link with the trivial pair groupoid is that we want to define an operation which takes @xmath44 and @xmath45 as input and spills @xmath46 as output . )",
    "the relevant figure is the following one , which is an improved version of the figure 5 , page 76 of bellache paper .",
    "bellache s recipe has to do with the points in blue .",
    "he says that first we have to go far from @xmath27 , by dilating the point @xmath42 w.r.t .",
    "the point @xmath27 , with the coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "here @xmath38 is considered to be small ( it will go to @xmath28 ) , therefore @xmath47 is big .",
    "the result is the blue point @xmath48 .",
    "then , we dilate ( or rather contract ) the point @xmath48 by the coefficient @xmath38 w.r.t . the point @xmath41 .",
    "the result is the blue point @xmath49 .",
    "bellache claims that when @xmath38 goes to @xmath28 the point @xmath49 converges to the sum @xmath43 .",
    "also , from this intrinsic definition of addition , all the other properties ( carnot group structure ) of the operation may be deduced from the uniformity of this convergence .",
    "he does not give a proof of this fact .",
    "the idea of bellache is partially correct ( in regards to the emergence of the algebraic properties of the operation from uniformity of the convergence of its definition ) and partially wrong ( this is not the correct definition of the operation ) .",
    "let me start with the second part .",
    "the definition of the operation has the obvious default that it uses the point @xmath48 which is far from @xmath27 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the local character of the definition of the metric tangent space ( and in contradiction with the local definition of dilations ) .",
    "but he is wrong from interesting reasons , as we shall see .    instead",
    ", a slightly different path could be followed , figured by the red points @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , instead of going far away first ( the blue point @xmath48 ) , then coming back at finite distance from @xmath27 ( the blue point @xmath49 ) , we may first come close to @xmath27 ( by using the red points @xmath51 ) , then inflate the point @xmath52 to finite distance from @xmath27 and get the point @xmath53 .",
    "the recipe is a bit more complicated , it involves three dilations instead of two , but i can prove that it works ( and leads to the definition of dilation structures and later to the definition of emergent algebras ) .",
    "the interesting part is that if we draw , as in the figure here , the constructions in the euclidean plane , then we get @xmath54 , so actually in this case there is no difference between the outcome of these constructions . at further examination",
    "this looks like an affine feature , right ?",
    "but in fact this is true in non - affine situations , for example in the case of intrinsic dilations in carnot groups , see the examples from the section [ secemergent ] .    let s think again about these dilations , which are central to our discussion , as being operations .",
    "we may change the notations like this :    @xmath55    then , it is easy to verify that the equality between the red point @xmath53 and the blue point @xmath49 is a consequence of the fact that in usual vector spaces ( as well as in their non - commutative version , which are carnot groups ) , the dilations , seen as operations , are self - distributive ! that is why bellache is actually right in his definition of the tangent space addition operation , provided that it is used only for self - distributive dilation operations .",
    "( but this choice limits the applications of his definition of addition operation only to carnot groups ) .",
    "[ [ remark ] ]   remark : + + + + + + + +    i was sensible to these two last sections of bellache s paper because i was prepared by one of my previous obsessions , namely how to construct differentiability only from topological data .",
    "this was the subject of my first paper , see the story told in the post `` http://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/topological-substratum-of-the-derivative/[topological substratum of the derivative ] '' , there is still some mystery to it , see http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4619[arxiv:0911.4619 ] .",
    "recall that in section [ secone ] is mentioned a paragraph by bellache , where he explains that the structure of the tangent bundle is `` concealed in dilations '' .",
    "this is now clear , i hope , but there is something left to do .",
    "bellache also mentions the classical construction of the tangent bundle made by connes , where the tangent bundle of the space @xmath56 appears as a completion of the trivial pair groupoid @xmath57 .",
    "what i want to explain now is how the dilations interact with the trivial groupoid to give the tangent bundle , in a sort of generalization of connes construction .",

    "it is important that this limit exists and that it is uniform , according to gromov s hint .",

    "nevertheless , theorem [ theo1 ] shows that the `` emergence of operations '' phenomenon is not at all specific to sub - riemannian geometry .",
    "in fact , once we get the idea of the right definition of approximate operations ( from sub - riemannian geometry ) , we can simply try to prove the theorem by `` abstract nonsense '' , i.e. algebraically , with a dash of uniform convergence at the end .    for this",
    "we have to identify the algebraic relations which are satisfied by these approximate operations .",
    "for example , is the approximate sum associative ? is the approximate difference the inverse of the approximate sum ? is the approximate inverse of an element the inverse with respect to the approximate sum ? and so on .",
    "the answer to these questions is `` approximately yes '' .",
    "it is clear that in order to find the right relations ( approximate associativity and so on ) between these approximate operations we need to reason in a more clear way . just by looking at the expressions of the operations from definition [ defi2 ] , it is obvious that if we start with a brute force `` shut up and compute '' approach then we will end rather quickly with a mess of parantheses and coefficients .",
    "there has to be a more easy way to deal with those approximate operations than brute force .",
