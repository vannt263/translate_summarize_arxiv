    "x - ray techniques have long been applied to image the electronic charge density of atoms , molecules , and materials @xcite .",
    "recently - developed x - ray free electron laser sources , which generate short ( attosecond ) , intense pulses , open up numerous potential applications for high temporal and spatial resolution studies @xcite .",
    "one exciting application is the determination of molecular structure by x - ray diffraction of nanocrystals @xcite avoiding the crystal growth process which is often the bottleneck in structure determination @xcite ; it may take decades to crystallize a complex protein .",
    "it is much easier to grow nanocrystals than the many - microns - sized samples required by conventional crystallography .",
    "this has been demonstrated experimentally in nanocrystals for the water splitting photosynthetic complex ii @xcite , a mimivirus @xcite , and a membrane protein @xcite .",
    "extending this idea all the way to the single - molecule level , totally removing  crystal \" from crystallogrpaphy is an intruiging possibility @xcite .",
    "obtaining a protein structure by scattering from a single molecule is revolutionary .",
    "many obstacles need to be overcome to accomplish this ambitious goal .",
    "for instance , the molecule will typically break down when subjected to such high fluxes .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that , for sufficiently short pulses , the scattering occurs prior to photon damage , so that this should not affect the measured charge density .",
    "this point is still under debate .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the scattering of a broad - band x - ray pulse from a system composed of a single , few , or many molecules prepared in a superposition of electronic states and show under what conditions the signal may be described solely by the time - dependent charge density .",
    "we assume that the x - ray pulse is off - resonance from any material transitions and that the pulse is sufficiently short so that the electrons in the sample do not appreciably re - arrange during the pulse time .",
    "the fluence is assumed sufficiently low so that the scattering is linear in pulse intensity .",
    "scattering off non - stationary evolving states is an area of growing interest .",
    "when the time - dependent state of matter merely follows some classical parameter ( as in the case of tracking the time - dependent melting of crystals @xcite ) no coherence of electronic states is prepared and the analysis of scattering is simplified considerably .",
    "time - dependent diffraction can then be described by simply replacing the charge density in stationary diffraction by the time - dependent charge - density .",
    "the situation is more complex in pump - probe experiments in which a superposition of electronic states is prepared by the pump and is then probed by x - ray scattering .",
    "such superpositions , which involve electronic coherence , can be prepared e.g. by inelastic stimulated raman processes @xcite , a photoionization process @xcite , off - resonant femtosecond pulses @xcite or high - intensity optical pumping @xcite .",
    "diffraction is a macroscopic , classical effect that involves the interference of wavefronts emanating from different sources treated at the level of maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "a fundamental difficulty in extending it to single molecules is that x - ray scattering ( as any light scattering ) from a single molecule may not be thought of simply as a diffraction since it has both elastic ( thompson / rayleigh ) and an inelastic ( compton / raman ) components @xcite . using a quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) approach , we discuss and analyze the single - particle vs. the cooperative contributions to the signal .",
    "we find that the two terms carry different particle form factors that permit raman scattering in different frequency ranges .",
    "simulations are presented for the scattering of a broad - band x - ray pulse from a single molecule of the amino acid cysteine either in the ground state or when prepared in a nonstationary state by a stimuated resonant x - ray raman process with various delay times between preparation and the scattering event .",
    "as the expressions developed in this paper bear a resemblence to the standard classical theory of diffraction , we review it briefly .",
    "the diffraction signal from a system initially in the ground state @xmath0 is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ground state charge density in @xmath3-space and @xmath4 is the momentum transfer ( @xmath5 is the outgoing mode and @xmath6 is the incoming mode ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath7 is the fourier transform of the charge - density operator @xmath8 equation ( [ eq : skclassic ] ) assumes that the scattering is elastic and treats the entire sample as a single system ( i.e. @xmath9 is the electron density of the entire sample ) .",
    "a common approach to understanding diffraction patterns involves making an approximation on the structure of the electron density .",
    "for example , we may presume that the complete wavefunction is built up from single - electron wavefunctions and the total electron density is the sum of the densities associated with each electon wavefunction .",
    "if the system is composed of @xmath10 identical particles and each electron is bound to a particle , then the amplitude of the signal from each particle carries a relative phase related to the particle position . the term ",
    "particle \" is used here as a generic partitioning of the system and may stand for atoms as well as large ( molecules ) or small ( unit cell ) groups of atoms . practically speaking , they should be large enough that the electron density between particles may be safely neglected and small enough that electronic structure calculations can be performed . separating single- and multi - particle contributions yields for the intensity @xcite : @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the position of particle @xmath13 relative to @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 stands for the electron density in a single particle and @xmath16 is known as the particle form factor .",
    "thus , the signal is factored into a product of the signals from the particle electron density and from the distribution of particles .",
    "the two terms in equation ( [ eq : skclassicsep ] ) both contribute linearly in @xmath10 to the integrated signal @xcite .",
    "however , the former yields a signal that is generally distributed throughout reciprocal space while the various terms in the @xmath17 summation carry different phases that cause a redistribution of the signal into points of constructive and destructive interference ( a bragg pattern for crystaline samples ) .",
    "we calculate the x - ray scattering by a sample initially prepared in a non - stationary state using a quantum description of the field , in which radiation back - reaction ( which leads to inelastic scattering ) is naturally built in .",
    "incorporation of the broad frequency bandwidth of incoming x - rays is an important point as ultra - short pulses need to outrun destruction in single - molecule scattering .",
    "we assume that the molecule is initially prepared in an arbitrary density matrix , representing a pure or mixed state such as photo - ions .",
    "we extend the quantum field formalism developed in @xcite for spontaneous emission of visible light to off - resonant x - ray scattering .",
    "our calculation starts with the minimal - coupling hamiltonian , which contains a term proportional to @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electronic current operator .",
    "the former describes instantaneous scattering where the electrons do not have the time to respond during the scattering process .",
    "the second term dominates resonant processes and allows for a delay between absorption and emission during which electronic rearrangement , ionization , and breakdown can occur . since hard x - rays",
    "are always resonant with the electronic continua representing various ionized states , the relative role of the @xmath19 term should be investigated further in order to clarify how important are these processes . in our study",
    ", we treat only off - resonant scattering and therefore focus on the @xmath21 term , which dominates such processes @xcite .    in the interaction picture ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bare field and matter hamiltonian while @xmath24 is the field - matter coupling .",
    "assuming the diffracting x - ray pulse is not resonant with any material transitions and its intensity is not too high , its interaction with the matter is given by @xcite @xmath25 we consider a sample of @xmath10 non - interacting , identical particles ( molecules or atoms ) indexed by @xmath13 with non - overlapping charge distributions so that the total charge - density operator can be partitioned as @xmath26 .",
    "the signal is given by the electric field intensity arriving at the detector and may be generally expressed as the overlap integral of a detector spectrogram ( given in terms of the detection parameters ) and a bare spectrogram ( equation [ eq : sspectrograms ] ) .",
    "the scattering signal mode is initially in the vacuum state @xmath27 .",
    "therefore an interaction on both bra and ket of the field density matrix is required to generate the state @xmath28 which gives the signal .",
    "we thus expand the signal as @xmath29 it is given in terms of the gated electric fields ( defined in appendix [ ap : gating ] ) , to second order in @xmath30 ( equation [ eq : hprime ] ) .",
    "this naturally leads to a double sum @xmath31 over the scatterers .",
    "terms with @xmath32 arise when the probe pulse is scattered off a single particle ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d].*a * ) and terms with @xmath33 describe two - particle scattering events ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d].*b * ) .",
    "the former contains @xmath10 terms which add incoherently ( at the intensity level ) , giving a virtually isotropic signal .",
    "the latter , in contrast , is governed by @xmath34 terms which carry different phase - factors and can interfere destructively or constructively ( yielding the bragg peaks in a crystalline sample or , more generally , a speckle pattern ) @xcite . in general , both contributions must be considered as it is frequently not sufficient to sample a signal only at the points of constructive interference ( bragg diffraction ) where the two - particle terms dominate @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the single - particle contribution as `` incoherent '' and the two - particle contribution as  coherent \" reflecting the way in which these contributions add ( at the intensity versus amplitude level ) . in the x - ray community ,",
    "incoherent is commonly taken to refer to inelastic contributions while coherent refers to elastic .",
    "the two nomenclatures coincide when considering scattering from the ground state because , as will be shown below , two - particle scattering from the ground state ( or any population ) is necessarily elastic while single - particle scattering from the ground state has only a single elastic term ( or one term for each initially populated state ) .",
    "two - particle scattering from a nonstationary superposition state , in contrast , has both elastic and inelastic terms which add coherently ( since they are both proportional to a spatial phase - factor @xmath35 dependent on the distance between the two particles ) .",
    "on the other hand , the elastic terms from the single - particle scattering add incoherently since their spatial phase factors are canceled by the opposite - hermiticity interactions on the ket / bra .    in the coherent terms the product of charge densities on different particles can be factorized and the signal is proportional to the modulus square of the single - particle electron density @xmath36 .",
    "such factorization is not possible for the incoherent terms where the signal is given by a correlation function of the charge density rather than the charge density itself . as discussed below",
    ", restricting attention to elastic scattering reduces the correlation function to the modulus - square result and eliminates the need to consider the correlation function .",
    "thus , the signal is expressible in terms of the charge - density alone either when the coherent contribution dominates or when attention is restricted to elastic scattering .",
    "figure [ fig:1d ] illustrates the incoherent ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d].*a * ) and coherent ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d].*b * ) scattering processes from a sample following preparation in a non - stationary electronic superposition state described by the density matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the preparation process is represented by the gray box . in this paper",
    ", we will consider a rama preparation process ( in another work , we examine the case where the preparation process is itself an off - resonant scattering process @xcite ) .",
    "after the preparation process ( which terminates at @xmath38 ) the system evolves freely until an x - ray probe pulse with an experimentally - controlled envelope centered at time @xmath39 impinges on the sample and is scattered into a signal mode that is initially in a vacuum state .",
    "this signal photon is then finally absorbed by the detector .",
    "time translation invariance of the matter correlation function implies the basic energy - conservation condition @xmath40 for an incoherent scattering event ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d].*a * ) .",
    "coherent scattering events ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d].*b * ) give two such conditions corresponding to the two diagrams @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for",
    "a broad - band pulse in which @xmath43 and @xmath44 can differ appreciably , the signal will contain contributions from paths in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 take all possible values within this bandwidth",
    ". these can be controlled by pulse - shaping techniques as well as by the choice of detection parameters @xcite .",
    "it follows from the diagrams that , since each particle must end the process in a population state and has only interactions on one side of the loop , coherent scattering from populations will always be rayleigh type while raman ( inelastic ) processes result from scattering off coherences . in contrast",
    ", the single - particle energy conservation condition for an initial population ( i.e. @xmath47 ) allows for inelastic processes .",
    "complete expressions for the signal which include arbitrary gating and pulse envelopes ( i.e. , the bare spectrograms ) are given in the appendix [ ap : barederivation ] . in this section , we discuss the simpler signal that results when no time - gating is applied .",
    "the formulas are simplest when we employ delta functions for the detector spectrograms . as shown appendix [ ap : gating ] we have separate detector spectrograms for the time - frequency gating and the space - propagation gating .",
    "as seen in appendix [ ap : barederivation ] ( equations ( [ eq : wbcohcf ] ) and ( [ eq : wbinccf ] ) ) both coherent and incoherent bare spectrograms carry the delta function factor @xmath48 .",
    "this connects @xmath49 to @xmath50 in the usual way ( though this is not automatic since the two are not a priori related in this way but rather both begin as seperate gating variables ) as well as fixing the direction of @xmath50 . for this reason ,",
    "the logical choice for the spatial - propagation detector spectrogram is @xmath51 this represents a spatially resolved signal ; that is , the location of the detection event ( the pixel location ) is resolved .",
    "all signals considered in this paper use this choice .    if the detector spectrogram does not depend on @xmath52 ( no time - gating is applied ) , we may separate the time - dependent phase factors from the auxilliary functions and carry out the time integration to give a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "the signals are therefore given by    @xmath54    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the momentum transfer , @xmath57 is the frequency gating function of appendix [ ap : gating ] and @xmath58 stands for the set of parameters that define the external pulse envelopes ( including @xmath59 ) .",
    "we approximate @xmath60 as a constant on the assumption that all pixels are roughly equidistant from the sample . in approaches to x - ray scattering",
    "that do not incorporate the detection event , the differential scattering cross section is calculated and found to be proportional to @xmath61 with @xmath62 the classical electron radius .",
    "our incorporation of the detection event included a summation over polarizations of the signal field and an averaging over initial polarizations and emission directions .",
    "this was shown to lead to the replacement @xmath63 while the use of atomic units equates @xmath64 .",
    "finally , since we calculate the signal ( defined as the expectation value of the gated electric field ) by explicitly incorporating the detection event ( which is linear in @xmath45 ) our result is proportional to @xmath65 . recalling that @xmath66 , we see that our result carries the appropriate proportionality factors compared to the usual differential scattering cross section ( @xcite ) .    that the arguments of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scohwr])-([eq : sincwr ] ) are @xmath67 and @xmath68 reflects the fact that they correspond to taking a spectrum at every pixel . since the final observed signal frequency is @xmath67 , we may as well relabel it @xmath45 to make the interpretation more intuitive . aside from the expected inverse - square dependence on @xmath69 ,",
    "the signal only depends on @xmath68 through @xmath70 , i.e. , the direction vector pointing from the sample to the pixel .",
    "since @xmath70 is the same as the direction of propagation of scattered light , this suggests representing the directional dependence by defining @xmath71 .",
    "finally , it is important to note that , althought these signals do not depend on time directly since we have assumed no time resolution ( i.e. , the pixels are simply left open to collect incoming light ) , the signal does depend parametrically on the central time of the incoming pulse through the field envelope @xmath72 which carries a phase factor @xmath73 . here",
    ", @xmath39 is the central time of the pulse envelope and the zero of time is set at the end of the state preparation process ( where the prepared state is presumed to be known ) . since @xmath39 therefore represents the time separation between state preparation and arrival of the center of the probe pulse and this is a key experimental control , we explicitly write this dependence in future expressions .      in the following ,",
    "we focus on the frequency - resolved signal because of its relative ease of interpretation .",
    "while this has not yet been demonstrated in the x - ray regime , it has been shown possible to discriminate a single wavelength component from multiwavelength scattering data in the euv range @xcite . from supplementary eqns .",
    "( [ eq : scohwr ] ) and ( [ eq : sincwr ] ) ) with @xmath74 , this signal is given by the sum of a coherent and an incoherent contribution which are related to the transition charge density @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the spectral envelope of the scattered pulse , @xmath78 are fourier transformed matrix elements of the charge - density operator and @xmath79,@xmath80,@xmath81 , and @xmath82 represent electronic states .",
    "we have also defined the momentum - transfer vector @xmath83 .",
    "the signal is not generally related to the time - dependent , single - particle charge density but rather to its correlation function @xcite .",
    "a compact expression for the total signal is @xmath84 where the correlation function of the total charge density operators may be expanded in terms of the single - particle densities as @xmath85 for a macroscopic sample initially in the ground electronic state , the standard classical theory of diffraction gives the signal as the product of the modulus square of the single - particle momentum - space electron density ( the form factor ) and a structure factor which describes the interparticle distribution ( equation ( [ eq : skclassicsep ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "this formula is used to invert the x - ray diffraction signal to obtain the ground state electron density once the  phase problem \" is resolved @xcite .",
    "substituting equation ( [ eq : cofunc ] ) into ( [ eq : stot ] ) yields a close resemblence to the classical expression for x - ray diffraction except that the coherent and incoherent terms now carry different form - factors .",
    "note that , if we restrict attention to elastic scattering , the correlation function in the incoherent term separates into a modulus square form and the two form factors are equal .",
    "cysteine is a sulfur - containing amino acid which affects the secondary structure of many protiens because of the disulfide bonds it forms .",
    "it has been implicated in biological charge transfer in respiratory complexes @xcite .",
    "we have previously explored various resonant x - ray spectroscopic signals from this molecule , including stimulated x - ray raman scattering ( sxrs ) and x - ray photon echo @xcite .",
    "below , we present calculations of off - resonant scattering from a single cysteine molecule ( chemical structure and oriention shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : gssignal]*a * and [ fig : gssignal]*b*. we also show the ground - state electron density , @xmath87 , the pulse power spectrum , and the pulse wave vector for reference .",
    "as these calculations are for a single isolated molecule , we can restrict our scattering calculations to the second ( incoherent ) term in equation ( [ eq : skmixed ] ) .",
    "we take the scattering pulse to be a transform - limited gaussian @xmath88 the center frequency @xmath89 is set to 10 kev , and we take the direction of propagation to be in the positive @xmath90 direction ( for molecule orientation , see fig .  [ fig : gssignal].*c * ) .",
    "the pulse duration is @xmath91 @xmath92 which orresponds to a fwhm bandwidth of 3.65 ev .",
    "future progress in pulse - generation may make such experiments realizable .",
    "for this frequency range , the difference between @xmath93 and @xmath94 for any two states @xmath79 and @xmath80 is negligibly small , and is ignored in the calculations presented herein .",
    "we take the signal detectors to be on square grid , 2 cm in length on each side , located 1 cm from the molecule in the positive @xmath90 direction ( i.e. we detect forward - scattered light ) .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum detected scattering angle of @xmath95 .",
    "we consider two different values for the detection frequency @xmath45 , one inside and one outside the pulse bandwidth .",
    "when we set the detection frequency equal to the pulse center frequency , we get the signal shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gssignal].*a*. this signal is dominated by the elastic scattering terms , where the scattering process does not change the state of the molecule . at this detection frequency , the elastic contribution is @xmath96 larger than the inelastic .",
    "the elastic scattering term can be eliminated by moving the detection frequency outside the pulse bandwidth . in fig .  [",

    "therefore all states with an energy between 4 and 12 ev will contribute .",
    "the scattering pattern resulting from the elastic and inelastic process are vastly different .",
    "the former is more strongly centered around the origin , corresponding to @xmath100 , and elongated in the @xmath101 direction .",

    "decay due to finite lifetime and dephasing is not included in the time - domain signals presented here .",
    "the contribution to the signal at a given detector due to a particular electronic coherence can be determined by fourier transforming with respect to the delay time .",
    "this would give information on the transition density for the contributing excited states .",

    "incoherent scattering , in contrast , generally produces both elastic and inelastic contributions regardless of the initial material state , as evident from equation ( [ eq : skmixed ] ) .",
    "thus , the coherent terms can only induce transitions between states populated by the material superposition state while the incoherent terms can induce transitions to any electronic state .",
    "notably , the incoherent and coherent signals come with different particle form factors .",

    "since light scattered from a single particle is not necessarily eleastic and can change the state of the particle , obtaining the charge density from single - particle scattering will require distinguishing between the rayleigh and raman components . furthermore , the total scattered intensity may not be fully described by the ground state charge density alone ; it requires more information about electronic excited states of the particle , i.e. the transition charge densities .",
