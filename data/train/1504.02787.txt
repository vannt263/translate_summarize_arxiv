    "tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes ( mbhs ) in galactic nuclei has been studied by theorists for over 40 years , in the context of supplying gas for accretion onto smbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "during the past sixteen years , several tidal disruption event ( tde ) candidates have been identified in the x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , ultra - violet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) bands .",

    "the advent of deeper all - sky surveys such as lsst , as well as forthcoming transient surveys in the radio and ultra - violet bands , are anticipated to considerably increase the number of tde observations .    the majority of the stars in the field , however , are in binaries , and some of the stars on a collisional course with the mbh will be members of a binary .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider an encounter between an mbh and a stellar binary , whose center of mass is approaching the mbh on a nearly parabolic orbit with the pericenter distance on the order of the tidal disruption radius of a single star . in this paper",
    "we show that such encounters often lead to the tidal disruption of both stars in sequence .",
    "we find that when the encounter between a stellar binary and an mbh leads to a tde , both members of the binary are disrupted in sequence more than 75% of the time .",
    "we estimate the frequency of such double tdes , and argue that many of them will produce light curves that are different from those of single tdes .",
    "we discuss the implications of this scenario for recent observations of double flares in sdss j015957.64 + 003310.5 @xcite and ic 3599 ( grupe et al 2015 ) .",
    "collisions between binary components caused by tidal forces from the mbh are also common @xcite .",
    "they populate the phase space of low angular momentum stars with merger products many of which will eventually be tidally disrupted .",
    "these merger products will have much larger magnetic fields than single stars @xcite .",
    "the high magnetic flux is accreted onto the mbh during a tde and can aid in generating prompt jets @xcite , such as observed in swift j164449.3 + 573451 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sec : population ] we develop a population model for the binaries approaching the mbh with small impact parameters , analytically justify why there should be a significant fraction of double tdes , and describe the setup of numerical experiments . in section [ sec : results ] we present numerical experiments in which we follow the newtonian dynamics of stars in binaries approaching the black hole , and flag tidal disruptions of individual stars and stellar collisions . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the observational implications of our findings .",
    "we are interested in binaries whose nearly radial approach to an mbh leads to a possible disruption of one or both binary companions . these binaries become tidally separated before they reach the point of closest approach @xcite .",
    "an illustration of loss - cone dynamics .",
    "the red rectangular region shows the angular momenta of individual stars which will be tidally disrupted , provided nothing changes their orbit on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the blue dashed lines indicate the loss cone for tidal separation of stellar binaries ( not to scale ) . at small radial separations , @xmath0 ,",
    "the binary loss cone is empty , so binaries like the one on the bottom are tidally disrupted before entering the regime where individual stars can be disrupted ; therefore , they can not be the source of double tdes . at larger radii @xmath1 ( top binary ) ,",
    "the loss cone is full and direct penetration into the stellar tidal disruption region is possible .",
    "double tdes originate from the full binary loss cone region . ]",
    "a star of mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 will be tidally disrupted by an mbh of mass @xmath4 if its orbit brings it within the tidal disruption radius of the mbh , [ rtidal ] r _ = r_*(m_/m_*)^1/3 ; here @xmath5 depends on the structure of the star @xcite . from here on we shall assume @xmath6 ; however , some surviving stars will , in fact , lose a fraction of their mass @xcite .",
    "a binary on a nearly parabolic orbit around the mbh whose center of mass has a periapsis @xmath7 is likely to first be tidally separated , and then to have both stars undergo sequential tidal disruptions .",
    "this happens because the component stars have specific angular momenta that are close to that of the binary s center of mass , and thus undergo a similar periapsis approach .",
    "the specific center of mass angular momentum of the binary on an orbit around the mbh with @xmath8 is l _ ~. the fractional difference in the angular momenta of the companions when the binary with semimajor axis @xmath9 is tidally separated is of order [ deltal ] ~ ~ ( ) ^1/3 , i.e. , less than one for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 au .",
    "therefore , the companion periapses will also typically be similar .",
    "the phase space where angular momenta are sufficiently low to allow for stellar tidal disruptions is marked by a solid red rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "it is non - trivial for a binary to be dynamically inserted into this region .",
    "this is because binaries will be tidally separated by the mbh whenever the binary s angular momentum around the mbh is less than l _ ~ , a region bounded by the dotted blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "therefore , to produce a double tde , a binary must enter the `` red '' region by jumping in from outside the blue lines !",
    "consider this dynamics in more detail .",
    "binaries wander stochastically in angular momentum space by gravitational scattering on other stars ; this process can be accelerated by gravitational interaction with massive perturbers outside of the mbh s sphere of influence ( soi ) @xcite and by secular gravitational torques in the near - keplerian potential deep inside the soi @xcite .",
    "if the typical change in angular momentum after one orbit is @xmath14 , the binary can never get onto a small angular momentum orbit intact . in the illustration of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , the lower binary will be tidally separated immediately upon crossing the dotted blue line and will never reach the red rectangle ; this regime is known as the empty loss cone @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "if @xmath15 , the binary can take large steps in angular momentum space , and can immediately jump anywhere within the loss cone @xmath16 ; this is more probable for binaries coming from far away from the mbh , as illustrated by the top binary of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] . in the full loss cone regime ,",
    "any angular momentum within the loss cone is nearly equally likely , and the probability that the binary ends up with a two - dimensional angular momentum @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "the dividing line between the full and empty loss cone corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "if the relaxation is governed by two - body interaction with other stars , the timescale for the angular momentum to change by the specific angular momentum of a circular orbit , @xmath20 , is _",

    "this yields the overall distribution of semimajor axes among binaries whose components can undergo individual tdes immediately following the tidal separation of the binary : [ d2n ] a^-7/(8 + 2 ) = a^-14/9 , where we assumed a bahcall - wolf cusp , @xmath30 .",
    "shallower cusps , such as the one in the galactic center @xcite , would increase the fraction of double tdes among all tdes .",
    "this estimate is simplistic , and does not take into account the detailed stellar distribution outside the soi .",
    "however , a more sophisticated analysis performed by @xcite in order to study the rate of tidal disruptions of giant stars is in agreement with our simple scaling . for a broad class of models",

    "we cut off the mass distribution for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where it is poorly observationally constrained .",
    "as discussed above , binaries of interest are distributed according to @xmath40 , so we simulate @xmath41 for binary periods @xmath42 between 0.1 day and 1000 years . approximately following @xcite",
    ", we assume that binaries with periods less than 10 days are tidally circularized , binaries with periods above 1000 days have eccentricities drawn from a thermal distribution @xmath43 , and binaries with periods between 10 and 1000 days have their eccentricity drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean 0.3 and standard deviation 0.15 , cut off at 0 and 1 .",
    "we impose the additional constraint that the initial binary periapsis must be at least twice the sum of their radii , where the stellar radii are @xmath44 , with @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 @xcite .",
