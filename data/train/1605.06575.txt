    "resonant tnos are protected from close neptune encounters and can attain high eccentricity , allowing them to be more easily detected when near perihelion .",
    "scattering tnos often approach the sun even more closely , as by definition they are required to have scattering encounters with neptune or another giant planet @xcite and thus have pericenters in the giant planet region .",

    "it became clear that no near - circular belt in the trans - neptunian region _",
    "could _ feed in jfcs without creating a scattering structure of large-@xmath10 tnos once strong encounters with neptune begin @xcite , and the discovery of the first member of this population , 1996 tl@xmath11 , was nearly simultaneous with this theory @xcite . dynamical simulations @xcite showed the surprising possibility that a non - negligible fraction ( @xmath51% ) of the initial planetesimal disk could still be in the scattering structure today ; it need not be in steady state with an eroding main kuiper belt . in this picture , the present - day structure of this scattering population is a band of objects with perihelia dominantly in the range @xmath12  au @xcite , steadily decreasing in number as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "tnos are displaced outwards almost solely by gravitational interactions with neptune ; tnos with @xmath13  au are rapidly depleted , and thus relatively rare , while tnos with @xmath14  au are extremely rare .",
    "the recognition that tnos with @xmath14  au existed , and in what must be great numbers @xcite led to the realization that the perihelion distribution must be extended to larger values @xcite .",
    "the current terminology in the literature is to use the term ` detached ' for tnos whose orbits are not today evolving due to neptune encounters @xcite , and scattering for those which are .",
    "unfortunately this does not correspond to a simple perihelion cut , although @xmath15  au is sometimes used @xcite .",
    "the existence of the detached population requires some other major process , either historical or ongoing , to produce tnos on these orbits .",

    "limits exist on the presence of distant solar system planets : analysis of data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) has shown that jupiter - mass planets can be ruled out within 26,000  au of the sun @xcite , though a superearth would be too faint in infrared wavelengths to be yet observed in the distant outer solar system ( 520  @xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have proposed a superearth on a circular orbit at roughly 250  au to explain the apparent clustering in argument of pericenter ( @xmath17 ) of a half - dozen detached tnos with large perihelia .",
    "the kozai - lidov effect and the inclination instability proposed by @xcite both demonstrate mechanisms for the clustering of @xmath17 , but tnos affected by either mechanism will continue to precess , and so naturally the orbits will separate over time .",
    "this idea is modified and expanded upon by @xcite , who find that an eccentric superearth is capable of maintaining clustering among high - pericenter tnos .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite rely on data from the minor planet center ( mpc ) database , the repository of the orbital parameters for all known tnos of which have orbits known from observation on multiple oppositions . ] , but which contains no information about observational parameters of the surveys in which these objects were discovered .",
    "the mpc tnos are from a multitude of different surveys , which largely have unreported pointings , limiting magnitudes , detection efficiencies , and tracking efficiency post - discovery ; this masks the true number of tnos in different dynamical classes @xcite .",

    "a survey with fully recorded observational biases can be properly debiased , giving the true numbers of objects required to exist in the unseen population in order to match the number of detections @xcite .",
    "we therefore select a subset of the published wide - field surveys , permitting highly precise tests of the effects of observational bias on the observability of the distant - tno orbital distributions .",

    "our goal is to see what dynamical signatures the addition of a superearth - scale planet generates within the the scattering and detached populations , and test this prediction against published , well - characterized surveys . in this paper , we measure the effect a distant superearth would have on the orbital distribution of the high-@xmath19 ( @xmath20  au ) , moderate-@xmath10 ( @xmath3  au ) component of the trans - neptunian populations , using a detailed dynamical simulation containing many thousands of test particles .",
    "we consider this population because it orbits beyond the dynamical dominance of neptune , will be gravitationally sculpted by any potential ninth planet , and has still has pericenters within the detectable range of existing surveys .",
    "we show that although the differences between the intrinsic distribution of high - pericenter tnos in models with and without a ninth planet are substantial , after observational biases are applied , the differences are currently indistinguishable .",
    "the fact that almost all known scattering objects have @xmath19=3538  au has tended to be viewed as confirmation of the baseline scattering scenario ; our results show that the detection biases in the scattering population are so strong that the @xmath14  au population could be numerous , but so weakly detectable that they are not represented in the observed sample . also using the survey simulator",
    ", we compare the predicted number of objects in the distant solar system , and find that having an additional planet requires 3 - 10 times as many objects in the moderate-@xmath10 population .",
    "in order to make a realistic model of the distant tnos as influenced by a possible superearth , we begin with the framework for building a scattering tno and oort cloud model used by @xcite , which is a modified version of the model from @xcite .",
    "our three dynamical simulations begin with a hundred thousand massless test particles distributed from 4 - 40 au , along with the 4 giant planets on their present - day orbits .",
    "the `` control '' sample is identical to that used by @xcite , while the other two simulations have an additional superearth with similar parameters to what was suggested by @xcite ( eccentric p9 : @xmath21 , @xmath22  au , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , and in the interest of completeness , what was suggested by @xcite ( circular p9 : @xmath21 , @xmath25  au , @xmath26 , @xmath24 ) .",

    "future analyses of this effect must not only demonstrate that this apparent clustering is not due merely to observational bias , but also provide an explanation for how tnos are preferentially emplaced or retained in a portion of the ninth planet s dynamical phase space that allows this shepherding effect to dominate detected tnos .",
    "the presence or absence of an additional superearth - mass planet also has important implications for the structure of the scattering tno disk and inner oort cloud .",
    "we find that the fraction of test particles that end up in the oort cloud population ( @xmath60  au and @xmath61  au ) is almost the same for each of the three surveys ( @xmath53% ) , so the presence of a distant superearth does not appear to be an important dynamical barrier to oort cloud production ( see figure  [ fig : oort ] ) .",
    "the fraction of objects that end up in the high-@xmath19 and moderate-@xmath10 population ( @xmath20  au , @xmath3  au ) , however , is significantly different for the three simulations . with an eccentric superearth ,",
    "the fraction is three times higher than the control simulation s value of 0.1% while a circular superearth produces a fraction that is nine times higher .",
    "these population ratios are largely beyond the current realm of detectability , but could provide an important diagnostic of our solar system s true planetary architecture in the future when compared with other tno populations .    using the simulations in this work , we find that a wide - field , relatively deep , off - ecliptic survey will have great power in constraining the presence or absence of an additional massive planet in our solar system because of the widely differing inclination distributions of scattering tnos produced by different solar system scenarios .",
