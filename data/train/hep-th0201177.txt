    "vacuum string field theory ( vsft ) @xcite is a candidate for the string field theory expanded around the tachyon vacuum . since there are no open string excitations in the tachyon vacuum , the vsft conjecture claims that the string field theory around the tachyon vacuum is obtained by replacing the brst charge in cubic string field theory ( csft ) @xcite by a purely ghost operator .",
    "although this sounds persuasive , we would like to know whether this conjecture is true .",
    "hence , it is very important to construct the d25-brane solution explicitly in vsft and investigate the energy density of the solution and the fluctuation spectrum around it .",
    "a translationally and lorentz invariant classical solution of vsft has been found in @xcite following earlier investigations @xcite .",
    "because this solution is believed to correspond to a d25-brane , it is expected that the energy density of the solution is equal to the d25-brane tension and the fluctuation spectrum around the solution reproduces that of the ordinary open string theory . to investigate",
    "the energy density and the fluctuation spectrum of the solution , in @xcite a tachyon wave function was constructed and the mass spectrum and the potential height are given in terms of the neumann coefficients expressing the three - string interactions . by the numerical study of @xcite , it was found that , although the tachyon mass is correctly reproduced , contrary to the expectation , the energy density is about twice the d25-brane tension .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite they evaluated these physical observables by using various identities among the neumann coefficients .",
    "the result is as follows .",
    "a neumann coefficient matrix has a twist symmetry , which causes the degeneracy of its eigenvalues . due to this degeneracy",
    ", the main constituents of the physical observables seem to vanish naively .",
    "however , actually in the numerical analysis , the observables acquire non - vanishing values , since the expressions of the physical observables behave singularly at the end of the eigenvalue distribution of the neumann coefficient @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as a breakdown of the twist symmetry and hence this phenomenon is called `` twist anomaly '' . since the calculations in @xcite have been done only by numerical method , it should be very interesting if we could evaluate the twist anomaly exactly .",
    "for such analytic calculation , we have to solve the eigenvalue problem of the neumann coefficient matrices .",
    "on the other hand , these observables in vsft are computed exactly by using boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) technique @xcite .",
    "using bcft , they showed that the tachyon mass squared is exactly equal to @xmath0 and the ratio of the energy density to the d25-brane tension is given by @xmath1 ^ 3\\simeq 2.05\\cdots$ ] , instead of the integer @xmath2 .",
    "since the correspondence between these geometric method of bcft and the algebraic one using the neumann coefficients is still not explicit , it is worth repeating exact calculations by the algebraic method .",
    "recently , an elegant paper @xcite has appeared , which solves the eigenvalue problem of the neumann coefficient matrix ( star algebra spectroscopy ) . in this paper , using the results of @xcite , we compute analytically the observables such as the tachyon mass and the energy density by the algebraic method to obtain the same results as those by the bcft method . in our analysis",
    "we adopt the regularization by cutting off the size of the neumann coefficient matrices to finite size ones .",
    "in particular , we clarify the origin of the twist anomaly in this regularization . other applications of the star algebra spectroscopy are found in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the classical solution of the vsft action , physical observables of this solution and their interpretation as twist anomaly . in sec .  3",
    ", we introduce the finite - size matrix regularization of the neumann coefficient matrices and calculate the tachyon mass by using this regularization .",
    "is devoted to the evaluation of the energy density of the solution . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize the paper and discuss some future problems . in appendix",
    "a and b , we present some technical details used in the text .",
    "in this section , we shall review how the physical observables are written in terms of the neumann coefficients . for this purpose",
    ", we shall first summarize the vsft action and the properties of the neumann coefficients , and then proceed to the construction of a classical solution and observables associated with the solution .",

    "further in @xcite , from the numerical analysis they found that this paradox emerges because the expression of @xmath53 ( [ g ] ) is singular at @xmath62 ( actually the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath26 ranges between @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite ) . due to this singularity , the expression ( [ g ] ) takes a form of the difference of two divergent quantities , and hence a careful treatment is necessary . on the basis of numerical analysis ,",

    "now we can express @xmath53 ( [ eq : gdeform ] ) in terms of the simple matrix @xmath81 and vector @xmath87 . adopting the calculation rules in @xcite , which we summarized in sec .",
    "2.2 , all we have to do is to concentrate on the most singular term .",
    "namely , we assign @xmath81 and @xmath87 their degrees of singularity @xmath60 and @xmath2 , respectively , and laurent - expand @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in @xmath53 with respect to @xmath81 around the singularity @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath62 : @xmath90 keeping only the terms with degree three , the quantity @xmath53 can be expressed as ) manifestly vanishes by naive treatment , we do not need to add it the correction term @xmath91 with degree less than three ( see sec .  3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "] @xmath92 the present expression of @xmath53 is indefinite as ever , and we have to regularize it . in the numerical analysis of the original expression of @xmath53 ( [ eq : gdeform ] ) , we adopted the level truncation , namely we cut - off all the infinite dimensional matrices into @xmath93 ones . while @xmath26 without regularization has the eigenvalue @xmath63 @xcite , in the level truncation the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath26 is lifted from @xmath63 . hence , this level truncation serves as a good regularization .    in this finite - size regularization",
    ", we have truncated the infinite - size matrices @xmath26 and @xmath28 into those of the same size @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the regularized version of the matrix @xmath95 in the denominator of ( [ gqk ] ) should be the truncation of the square of the infinite dimensional matrix , @xmath96 , since this @xmath95 originates from @xmath97 ( [ m0simk1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the regularized version of @xmath81 in the numerator of ( [ gqk ] ) , which comes from @xmath28 ( [ m1simk1 ] ) , should simply be the truncation of @xmath81 itself , @xmath98 .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us study how the degeneracy of the eigenvalues between twist - even and odd eigenvectors is lifted due to finite - size matrix regularization . here",
    "we shall change rows and columns of a generic matrix @xmath99",
    ". we shall bring rows with odd indices into the upper side and ones with even indices into the lower side , and repeat a similar manipulation for columns : @xmath100 since the matrix @xmath81 is twist - odd , @xmath101 , its diagonal blocks vanish in this representation .",
    "@xmath102 although the off - diagonal blocks are not symmetric matrices by themselves , we can give them a useful decomposition .",

    "after squaring ( [ ktruncated ] ) , we find the diagonal block symmetric .",
    "therefore , we can diagonalize it : @xmath104 where the diagonal matrix @xmath105 and the orthogonal matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 are all @xmath108 ones .",
    "note here that the eigenvalues @xmath109 of the odd - odd sector and even - even one degenerate because their eigenvalue equations are identical : @xmath110 the eigenvalue distribution of finite - size regularized matrix @xmath81 was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "they found that the spacing between the nearest eigenvalues is independent of @xmath109 and given by @xmath111 assuming that the spacing ( [ spacing ] ) applies also to two adjacent eigenvalues with opposite sign to ( 6.3 ) in @xcite supports this assumption to high precision . ] and using the facts that the eigenvalues @xmath109 and @xmath112 are always paired and that there exits no zero eigenvalue in the case @xmath113 , the eigenvalues of @xmath114 , which are the diagonal elements of @xmath105 , are given by @xmath115 note that the degeneracy in ( [ k|2l^2 ] ) always occurs for any finite - size matrix @xmath99 which is symmetric @xmath116 and twist - odd @xmath117 .",
    "using the expression ( [ k|2l^2 ] ) of @xmath118 , we find a useful decomposition for @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath119 this decomposition is unique up to the overall sign .",
    "this can be seen by counting the degrees of freedom in the matrix . each of the @xmath108 orthogonal matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 has @xmath120 degrees of freedom , and the diagonal matrix @xmath105 has @xmath121 degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the number of degrees of freedom in the rhs of ( [ k|2l ] ) is equal to @xmath122 , which agrees with that of @xmath123^t$ ] on the rhs of ( [ ktruncated ] ) .",
    "since the expression ( [ k|2l ] ) has the same number of degrees of freedom as in the original matrix ( [ ktruncated ] ) , we see that the decomposition is unique .",
    "the same argument holds for the case that the truncation level @xmath94 is an odd number @xmath124 , except that in this case we encounter rectangular matrices and a careful analysis is necessary . in this case",
    "the square of the matrix @xmath81 is @xmath125 here @xmath126 and @xmath127 are @xmath108 matrices , while @xmath128 is a @xmath129 matrix .",
    "since both the odd - odd block ( an @xmath129 matrix ) and the even - even one ( an @xmath108 matrix ) have the same rank , the former one should have an extra zero eigenvalue .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath126 is now given as @xmath130 the eigenvalue spectrum ( [ lambda2l+1 ] ) can be understood from the spacing ( [ spacing ] ) and the fact that we have a zero eigenvalue in the present case .",
    "hence , the matrix @xmath131 by itself reads @xmath132 where @xmath133 is an @xmath134 matrix with vanishing @xmath135-th column .",
    "now let us return to the expression ( [ gqk ] ) of @xmath53 . as we explained in the previous subsection , the regularized version of @xmath95 in the denominator stands for @xmath136 , namely the truncation of the square of the original infinite dimensional matrix @xmath81 .",
    "we see here how the breakdown of the twist symmetry happens in this regularization . in the original representation before changing rows and columns into ( [ moe ] ) , the difference between truncating before squaring , @xmath137 , and truncating after squaring , @xmath136 , appears only at the last @xmath138 component . as seen from ( [ k1 nm ] ) , the last component of @xmath137 is @xmath139 , while that of @xmath136 is @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath113 , since the last component in the original representation belongs to the even - even block , the odd - odd block of the matrix @xmath141 should be the same as that of @xmath118 . as for the even - even block of @xmath141 , it can be read off from another matrix @xmath142 .",
    "note that , while the odd - odd block of this matrix @xmath142 is enlarged to @xmath129 , its even - even block is of the same size @xmath108 as the even - even block of @xmath141 .",
    "since the last @xmath143 component of @xmath142 belongs to the odd - odd block , the even - even block of this matrix is the same as that of @xmath141 , which is of our interest .",

    "the eigenvector @xmath152 of @xmath81 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath109 , @xmath153 is given by ( [ fcomp ] ) .",
    "we define the twist - odd eigenvectors @xmath154 and twist - even eigenvectors @xmath155 of @xmath95 as @xmath156 for @xmath157 with integer @xmath158 and similar ones @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "the matrices @xmath106 , @xmath128 , @xmath107 and @xmath127 are expressed using these eigenvectors . introducing new symbols for these matrices to avoid cumbersome subscripts , we have @xmath162 where the vectors with a bar , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , denote the normalized ones of @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the subscripts h and i imply half - an - odd integer and integer eigenvalues ( in unit of @xmath167 ) , respectively .",

    "the norm of the eigenvectors is derived in appendix [ app : norm ] . especially for the vector in the finite @xmath94 regularization , the norm is given by ( [ norm ] ) with the delta function ( [ delta ] ) .",

    "therefore our expression for @xmath53 is reduced to @xmath179 in the limit @xmath180 , we can replace @xmath181 by @xmath182 in ( [ g=1/sinh ] ) and finally obtain the desired result : @xmath183    the reason why we have obtained a non - vanishing value of @xmath53 is that the degeneracy of eigenvalues between odd - odd and even - even sectors is lifted in the finite @xmath94 regularization as seen from ( [ k^2|2l ] ) and ( [ 1/k ] ) . as remarked below ( [ lambda2l ] ) , the degeneracy is a general property of twist - odd symmetric matrices .",
