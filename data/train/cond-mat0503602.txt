    "lateral gated devices can be defined in the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of a semiconductor heterostructure using surface gates .",
    "@xcite their tunability makes them the ideal choice for many fundamental applications , such as the implementation of solid state quantum bits ; a single electron can be isolated and probed in single and double dot devices .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , they are extremely sensitive to fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment .",
    "these fluctuations provide one of the most important obstacles to developing such devices for future applications in areas such as spin and charge qubits , where a quiet electrostatic environment is essential .",
    "while fluctuations can result from external sources such as voltage noise on a gate , which is relatively easy to remove , the main difficulties stem from noise which behaves as if it is intrinsic to the wafer .",
    "changes in impurity configurations and in the charge states of electronic traps are examples of such noise .",
    "this type of temporal fluctuation results in a random switching of device characteristics @xcite known as random telegraph noise ( rtn ) .",
    "its consequences include deterioration in the stability of the number of electrons in quantum dots and the conductance of mesoscopic conductors .    unlike in mosfet devices , where the source of rtn is better understood , @xcite",
    "no definitive conclusions have been reached to explain the origin of switching noise observed in gaas / algaas 2deg devices .",
    "there exists a long history of the study of this noise .",
    "@xcite several mechanisms have been proposed to account for rtn , as well as the related @xmath2 and lorentzian noise , including a gate leakage current through localized states , electron trapping , switching events in a remote doping layer and dx centres .",
    "nevertheless , it is well established experimentally that the noise level in gaas / algaas gated devices can be affected by a gate voltage .",
    "for example @xmath2 noise in submicron hall devices can be reduced by applying a moderate voltage on the gate @xcite and rtn in quantum dot devices can be reduced by applying a positive voltage to the gates during cooldown .",
    "@xcite the latter technique , known as bias cooling , provides a `` frozen in '' gate voltage at low temperature related to the filling of dx centres at higher temperatures .",
    "@xcite for structures with a uniform gate , the procedure was shown to affect the degree of correlations established in the doping layer between the positively charged donors and the negatively charged dx centers thereby influencing the 2deg mobility .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present a detailed study of the effect of bias cooling on the noise characteristics of gaas / algaas gated nanodevices and develop a model to explain these results . by carefully monitoring the noise level in quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) for different bias voltages applied during cool down , we find that the frequency of switching events in moderately noisy samples can be reduced to zero beyond a positive threshold bias . in one particularly noisy sample ,",
    "the noise was reduced by at least two orders of magnitude over a narrow window of positive bias .",
    "we also observed a pronounced dependence of the noise on the difference in voltage between the gates .",
    "we propose that the rtn is triggered by a small leakage current of electrons tunneling from the gate into the conduction band of the heterostructure .",
    "some electrons are trapped in long - lived localized states near the active region of the device and cause rtn before they reach the 2deg .",
    "we explain how bias cooling can suppress this leakage current through its influence on the barrier under the gate .",
    "direct evidence for the leakage current , which is an essential feature of our model , is provided by monitoring the charge trapped in a closed quantum dot .",
    "the heterostructure used in this study was grown by molecular - beam epitaxy and included a 40 nm thick @xmath3 spacer , 2 monolayers of gaas ( 5.6 ) , a 40 nm thick @xmath3 layer uniformly doped with si , capped by 15 nm of gaas .",
    "the doping density was @xmath4 .",
    "the 2deg was thus located at an interface 95.56 nm below the surface .",
    "the density and mobility of the 2deg were @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "to characterize rtn in gated structures , we fabricated quantum point contact devices .",
    "the qpc was employed as a simple but sensitive tool for monitoring changes in the local electrostatic potential caused by charge fluctuations .",
    "using the conductance of the qpc s rather than coulomb blockade peaks in lateral dots as a noise monitor has the advantage that dilution refrigerator temperatures are not required .",

    "a mechanism that explains the observed effect of bias cooling on the noise must satisfy these two , apparently conflicting , constraints .    1 .   the primary effect of a gate bias @xmath34 during the cool is to alter the ionization of donors near the surface ; it has no direct effect on the 2deg .",
    "after the bias is removed at low temperature the sample behaves as if there were a built - in gate bias of @xmath35 .",
    "the fluctuations are caused by a charge that must be trapped close enough to the qpc to modulate the conductance by around @xmath36 , and with a lifetime of around 1s .",

    "it is less than 1 nm thick .    for simplicity",
    "the sketches are drawn on the assumption of an abrupt transition between ionized and neutral regions .",
    "the neutral region is present because the wafer contains far more donors than are needed to generate the electrostatic potentials at the surface and 2deg .",
    "this is typical and is vital to our model .",

    "[ bias cool bands fig](b ) during cooling with a bias @xmath43 on the gate .",
    "donors are free to change their occupation at room temperature when the bias is first applied . the mobile charge closest to the gate responds to the bias , which therefore attracts electrons into the doped layer .",

    "there is no effect on the 2deg at all .",
    "the occupation of the donors becomes fixed when the temperature of the sample is lowered through 100k because the barriers to trapping and de - trapping become too high .",

    "now consider a negative bias applied to patterned gates so that a qpc such as the one shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ qpc cond fig ] is just cut off .",
    "suppose that the design requires @xmath46 for cutoff on layers that were cooled without bias ; this small magnitude was chosen to make the sketches clear .",
    "[ cutoff bands fig](a ) shows the conduction band along a line that goes from a gate to the channel at the midpoint of the qpc ( this line is not normal to the surface as in fig .",
    "[ bias cool bands fig ] ) .",
    "the qpc is only just cut off so the conduction band in the midpoint of the channel brushes the fermi level @xmath39 .",
    "the negative bias on the gate raises its fermi level @xmath37 by 0.4ev , which permits electrons to tunnel into the channel .",
    "this gives rise to a leakage current and ultimately to the switching noise .",
    "the leakage can be classified into three regimes .    1 .",
    "the current is tiny for small negative bias because electrons must tunnel through the full thickness of the cap , doped and spacer layers into the channel .",
    "2 .   the current starts to increase rapidly when when the bias rises to @xmath47 , because electrons need no longer tunnel through the spacer .",
    "3 .   as the bias rises further , the barrier for electrons at the fermi level @xmath37 becomes narrower until electrons need tunnel only through the cap and the shallow ionized layer of donors , less than 30 nm .",
    "the sample in fig .",
    "[ cutoff bands fig](a ) is just in this limit .",
    "this happens roughly when @xmath48 due to the `` lever - arm factor '' .",
    "any further increase in bias has a smaller effect .",
    "the rapid growth of the leakage current with increasing negative bias explains the observation in sec .",
    "[ results section ] that the noise tends to increase as more negative bias is applied .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [ cutoff bands",
    "fig](b ) shows the comparable situation for layers that were cooled under a bias of @xmath43 . there is a built - in bias of @xmath49 from the cooling",
    ", so an applied bias of only @xmath44 is needed to reach the same operating point as in fig .",
    "[ cutoff bands fig](a ) . the fermi level in the gate @xmath37",
    "is therefore raised by only 0.2ev instead of 0.4ev .",
    "leakage remains in regime 1 with tunneling all the way to the channel , nearly 100 nm .",
    "thus a positive bias cool suppresses tunneling because a smaller applied bias is needed for the same operating point .",
    "moreover , bias cooling also reduces tunneling at the _ same _ applied bias .",
    "this is because the smaller density of ionized donors causes the conduction band to fall more slowly away from the schottky barrier @xmath38 under the gate .",
    "[ bias cool bands fig](a ) and ( c ) show this at equilibrium : the barrier is more opaque in the bias cooled sample ( c ) and this feature is preserved when a negative bias is applied to the gate .",
    "we have calculated the effect of bias cooling on the current density @xmath50 from a large gate biased to the threshold voltage , using a simple wkb estimate of tunneling through uniform layers as in fig .",
    "[ bias cool bands fig ] .    * for @xmath13 the conditions at threshold lie on the crossover between regimes 1 and 2 above , giving @xmath51 . *",
    "positive bias cooling with @xmath43 brings the sample firmly into regime 1 , where electrons must tunnel from the gate all the way to the channel , and @xmath50 falls to @xmath52 . *",
    "negative bias cooling with @xmath53 leads to a narrow barrier , just the cap and shallow ionized layer of donors ( regime 3 ) .",
    "leakage rises to @xmath54 , which is consistent with our observations in sec .",
    "[ dot section ] .",
    "although the real situation in our three - dimensional devices is more complex than for this simple model , our calculation shows that the effect of bias cooling on the tunnel current is dramatic because the geometry of the barrier at threshold is greatly changed .",
    "a stronger bias is needed to deplete a device with a patterned gate and larger values of @xmath15 are therefore needed to suppress tunneling .",
    "electrons that tunnel from the gate must eventually reach the 2deg but may take many routes . if they travel entirely in the conduction band there will be no switching noise ; the observed fluctuations require a trap close to the qpc .",
    "_ @xcite observed an irreversible telegraph noise signal and argued that transport was by hopping between localized states .",
    "our signals appear to arise from independent traps and usually only one is active .",
    "we suggest that most of the transport occurs in the conduction band , although the final state before the 2deg must be a sufficiently deep trap to give fluctuations of the observed frequency .",
    "we feel that it is unlikely that electrons are trapped in their passage through most of the doped layer , despite the high density of possible traps provided by the donors .",
    "shallow levels would become ionized in the high electric field under the gate , while electrons that enter the deep dx levels would probably be trapped permanently at the low temperature of the experiment .",
    "their charge would accumulate and cause a slow shift of threshold voltages with time .",
    "such drifts have not been observed in our experiments .",
    "the localized state that gives rise to the switching noise is most likely to be in the thin layer of ionized donors next to the spacer layer .",
    "the hydrogenic level of a donor gives a binding energy of around 6mev , which is reinforced by the v - shaped potential well generated by the layer of charge , shown in fig .",
    "[ cutoff bands fig ] .",
    "electrons must tunnel through the 40 nm spacer to reach the channel and a very rough estimate of the lifetime is not inconsistent with the timescales observed in the experiments .",
    "these localized states would be present even in a perfectly clean sample .",
    "however , there may also be defects or impurities in the nominally undoped spacer or channel , which could provide further telegraph signals . on the other hand , if their lifetime is short , such impurities might instead reduce noise by providing a `` short circuit '' across the localized states among the donors .",
    "a resonant channel of this sort could explain the notch seen in the top curve in fig .",
    "[ noise frequency fig ] .    in most cases an electron will reach an open region of 2deg , from which it can return to the contacts .",
    "however , it is also possible that it might enter a confined region of 2deg , such as a quantum dot .",
    "we shall explore this in sec .",
    "[ dot section ] .",
    "our model also explains other features of the experiments .",
    "the effect of bias cooling saturates for @xmath55 because the conduction band in the cap is pulled below the fermi level in the semiconductor , @xmath39 .",
    "this results in a third channel of electrons in the cap that screens the donors from any further change in bias .",
    "secondly , a device with asymmetrically biased gates is noisier than when the same average bias is applied symmetrically , because an increase of the negative bias on one gate increases the transparency of the barrier underneath .",
    "we now provide direct evidence for the leakage current by setting up a situation where electrons tunneling from the gate enter a closed region , which acts as a `` corral '' .",
    "this is achieved by a quantum dot that can be isolated from the contacts together with a qpc charge sensor .",
    "electrons that enter this region can not be collected by the contacts and thus the number of electrons in the closed region should increase with time .",

    "it might be expected that a negative bias would repel electrons from the dot , in which case an upward step in conductance would be seen in the qpc .",
    "however , the opposite is seen : the sweep in the negative direction causes discrete _ downward _ steps of equal height .",
    "the smooth variation between steps is caused by the direct electrostatic coupling between the qpc channel and the gate .",

    "we have shown that the level of switching ( telegraph ) noise in a algaas / gaas gated device can be dramatically reduced by applying a positive gate bias while the device is cooled down and have provided a model to explain this .",
    "such a cooling bias was also found to shift the characteristics of the device as if there were a built - in gate voltage of equal magnitude but opposite sign , as we predict .",

    "<S> the key to reducing noise is to keep the barrier opaque under experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> cooling with a positive bias on the gates reduces the density of ionized donors . </S>",
    "<S> this builds in an effective negative gate voltage so that a smaller negative bias is needed to reach the desired operating point . </S>",
    "<S> this suppresses tunnelling from the gate and hence the noise . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in the density of ionized donors also strengthens the barrier to tunneling at a given applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> further support for the model comes from our direct observation of the leakage current into a closed quantum dot , around @xmath1 for this device . </S>",
    "<S> the current was detected by a neighboring quantum point contact , which showed monotonic steps in time associated with the tunneling of single electrons into the dot . </S>",
    "<S> if asymmetric gate voltages are applied , our model suggests that the noise will increase as a consequence of the more negative gate voltage applied to one of the gates to maintain the same device conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we observe exactly this behaviour in our experiments . </S>"
