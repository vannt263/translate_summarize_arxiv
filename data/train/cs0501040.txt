    "this note offers a contribution to the study of equational characterizations of the parallel composition operation modulo ( variations on ) the classic notion of bisimulation equivalence  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we provide a finite equational axiomatization of _",
    "split-2 bisimulation equivalence_a notion of bisimulation equivalence based on the assumption that actions have observable beginnings and endings  @xcite  over the recursion , relabelling and restriction free fragment of milner s ccs  @xcite enriched with an auxiliary operator proposed by hennessy in a 1981 preprint entitled _",
    "`` on the relationship between time and interleaving '' _ and its published version  @xcite .",
    "to put this contribution , and its significance , in its research context , we find it appropriate to recall briefly some of the key results in the history of the study of equational axiomatizations of parallel composition in process algebra .",
    "research on equational axiomatizations of behavioural equivalences over process algebras incorporating a notion of parallel composition can be traced at least as far back as the seminal paper  @xcite , where hennessy and milner offered , amongst a wealth of other classic results , a complete equational axiomatization of bisimulation equivalence over the recursion free fragment of ccs .",
    "( see the paper  @xcite for a more detailed historical account highlighting , e.g. , hans beki s early contributions to this field of research . )",
    "the axiomatization given by hennessy and milner in that paper dealt with parallel composition using the so - called _ expansion law_an axiom schema with a countably infinite number of instances that is essentially an equational formulation of the plotkin - style rules describing the operational semantics of parallel composition .",
    "this raised the question of whether the parallel composition operator could be axiomatized in bisimulation semantics by means of a finite collection of equations .",
    "this question was answered positively by bergstra and klop , who gave in  @xcite a finite equational axiomatization of the merge operator in terms of the auxiliary left merge and communication merge operators .",
    "moller clarified the key role played by the expansion law in the axiomatization of parallel composition over ccs by showing in  @xcite that strong bisimulation equivalence is _ not _ finitely based over ccs and pa without the left merge operator .",
    "( the process algebra pa  @xcite contains a parallel composition operator based on pure interleaving without communication and the left merge operator . )",
    "thus auxiliary operators like the ones used by bergstra and klop are indeed necessary to obtain a finite axiomatization of parallel composition .",
    "moreover , moller proved in  @xcite that his negative result holds true for each `` reasonable congruence '' that is included in standard bisimulation equivalence .",
    "in particular , this theorem of moller s applies to split-2 bisimulation equivalence since that equivalence is `` reasonable '' in moller s technical sense .    in his paper",
    "@xcite , hennessy proposed an axiomatization of observation congruence  @xcite ( also known as rooted weak bisimulation equivalence ) and timed congruence ( essentially rooted weak split-2 bisimulation equivalence ) over a ccs - like recursion , relabelling and restriction free process language .",
    "those axiomatizations used an auxiliary operator , denoted @xmath0 by hennessy , that is essentially a combination of bergstra and klop s left and communication merge operators . apart from having soundness problems ( see the reference  @xcite for a general discussion of this problem , and corrected proofs of hennessy s results ) , the proposed axiomatization of observation congruence is _ infinite _ , as it used a variant of the expansion theorem from  @xcite . confirming a conjecture by bergstra and klop in  @xcite , and answering problem  8 in  @xcite , we showed in  @xcite that the language obtained by adding hennessy s merge to ccs does _ not _ afford a finite equational axiomatization modulo bisimulation equivalence .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in strong bisimulation semantics , no finite collection of equations can express the interplay between interleaving and communication that underlies the semantics of hennessy s merge .",
    "technically , this is captured in our proof of the main result in  @xcite by showing that no finite collection of axioms that are valid in bisimulation semantics can prove all of the equations in the following family : @xmath1 in split-2 semantics , however , these equations are not sound , since they express some form of interleaving .",
    "indeed , we prove that , in sharp contrast to the situation in standard bisimulation semantics , the language with hennessy s merge _ can be finitely axiomatized _ modulo split-2 bisimulation equivalence , and its use suffices to yield a finite axiomatization of the parallel composition operation .",
    "this shows that , in contrast to the results offered in  @xcite , `` reasonable congruences '' finer than standard bisimulation equivalence can be finitely axiomatized over ccs using hennessy s merge as the single auxiliary operation ",
    "compare with the non - finite axiomatizability results for these congruences offered in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by presenting preliminaries on the language @xmath2the extension of ccs with hennessy s merge operator  and split-2 bisimulation equivalence in sect .",
    "[ sect : hccs ] .",
    "we then offer a finite equational axiom system for split-2 bisimulation equivalence over @xmath2 , and prove that it is sound and complete ( sect .",
    "[ sect : ax ] ) .",
    "this is a companion paper to  @xcite , where the interested readers may find further motivation and more references to related literature .",
