    "food production is by far the most freshwater - consuming process ( 80% of the total world water resources @xcite ) . due to population growth and economic development ,",
    "water shortage is thus subject to increasing pressure at local and global scales .",
    "several studies have recently focused on the issues of globalization of water ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the concept of virtual water ( vw ) @xcite .",
    "they have highlighted the importance of tackling water management problems not only at the basin or country scales , but rather through a worldwide perspective @xcite .",
    "nevertheless a complete statistical characterization describing the network of vw transfers on a global scale has only started @xcite and a model to explain such characteristics is still lacking .",
    "this letter deals with a novel theoretical network model that robustly describes topological and weighted properties of the global vw trade network ( gvwtn ) for the characterization of the vw flows of @xmath0 major crops ( barley , corn , rice , soy , and wheat ) and @xmath1 livestock products ( beef , poultry , and pork ) .",
    "the vw content of such commodities are calculated for each nation using a state - of - the - art global water resources model @xcite , at a spatial scale of @xmath2 .",
    "combining the model outputs with the data of the international trade of food products referred to the year 2000 @xcite , the vw flows among nations are obtained ( see @xcite and auxiliary materials for details ) and compared with model results .",
    "of particular interest is deemed our predictive use of the model to analyze the impact of future scenarios of social , economic , and climate change .",
    "here we briefly present and interpret key statistical characterizations of the gvwtn ( addressed in @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    "we discuss here the undirected network case , where @xmath3 is a symmetric matrix whose elements ( @xmath4 ) represent the total volume of vw exchanged between countries ( nodes ) and obtained by summing the corresponding import and export fluxes ( figure 1 ) . for mathematical details and analysis of the directed network see auxiliary materials .",
    "the global topology of a network is described by its degree probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 is the probability that the degree of a given node is @xmath7 @xcite ( figure 2a ) .",
    "it provides the number of edges connected to a given node regardless of the identity of the neighbors . to investigate how nodes are connected , we study the average nearest neighbor degree @xmath8 which shows a tendency of the nodes with high degree to provide connectivity to small degree nodes ( figure 2c ) . such trend ( known as disassortative behavior ) denotes , differently from purely random networks , non - trivial nodal degree correlations @xcite .",
    "another interesting indicator is the local clustering coefficient @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) which describes the ability of node @xmath11 to form cliques , i.e. triangles of connected nodes .",
    "figure 2d shows that poorly connected nations @xmath11 tends to form connected trading food sub - markets ( @xmath12 ) . on the contrary , high degree vertices",
    "@xmath13 connect otherwise disconnected regions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the average clustering coefficient is very high ( @xmath15 ) and the graph has , in analogy to many real networks @xcite , an average node - to - node topological distance ( @xmath16 ) smaller than 5 ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "the gvwtn thus exhibits a small - world network behavior @xcite , providing a quantitative measure of the globalization of water resources @xcite .",
    "the hydrological features of the network are given by its weighted properties .",
    "the total volume imported and exported by nation @xmath11 is quantified by its strength @xmath18 , defined as the total vw volume exchanged by node @xmath11 . the strength distribution shows a heavy - tailed pdf suggesting high heterogeneity of the volumes of traded vw ( figure 2b ) : only 4% of the total number of links accounts for 80% of the total flow volume @xcite , indicating established bonds among countries that rule the main fluxes in the gvwtn ( figure 1 )",
    ". strengths between neighboring nodes are correlated .",
    "in fact , the average nearest neighbor strength @xmath19 @xcite displays a decreasing trend as a function of @xmath20 ( figure 2e ) .",
    "strength - strength correlations disentangled from degrees ( @xmath21 ) @xcite are not significant , i.e. @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "a power - law relation @xmath22 with exponent @xmath23 @xcite indicates a non - trivial correlation between node degrees and strengths @xcite .",
    "the above suggests that we live in a global water world where , on average , the export of vw from few water rich countries increases the food locally available to the connected nations . at the same time , there exist preferential vw routes , mainly driven by geographical , political and economical factors , through which most of the vw volume flows .",
    "the complexity of all factors ( political , economical and environmental ) involved in shaping the gvwtn structure is remarkable , and calls for investigating whether key variables and linkages exist through which the emerging structural properties of the network could be revealed .",
    "we have developed a model that allows us to describe concisely all the above features of the gvwtn .",
    "specifically , we assume that the topological and weighted features of the network can be determined , respectively , by two external characteristics of each node : namely , the gross domestic product @xcite ( @xmath24 ) and the ( average ) yearly rainfall [ mm / yr ] on agricultural area [ km@xmath25 ( denoted by @xmath26 [ mm@xmath27km@xmath28/yr ] ) .    toward this end ,",
    "each of the 184 nodes is assigned a normalized value of the @xmath24 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath30 ) based on data from 2000 @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to these variables as fitness ( or hidden ) variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they measure the relative importance of the vertices in the gvwtn . @xmath24 and @xmath26 are assumed to be good candidates to explain the structure of the gvwtn .",
    "in fact the country @xmath24 is closely related to its trade activity @xcite , while volumes of vw traded depend on the amount of crops and meat produced in that country , that in turn depends on the @xmath26 .",
    "a good agreement between data and model results proves these facts .",
    "the fitness network - building algorithm consists of the following steps : @xmath33 we connect every couple of vertices , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , ( with @xmath34 ) with a probability @xmath35 ; @xmath36 we assign to each link between @xmath11 and @xmath13 a weight @xmath37 with value given by @xmath38 .",
    "the parameters of the model are @xmath39 and @xmath40 and they are determined by the compatibility conditions : @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the total number of edges in the network and @xmath44 the total flux .",
    "no tuning of the parameters is carried out and all results presented here correspond to the above choice for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . for details on the model and its generalization to the directed network case see appendix and auxiliary materials .",
    "the model predicts that for each country the number of food trade partners grows non linearly with its @xmath24 ( similarly to the world trade web @xcite ) , while the total exported and imported vw is found proportional to the @xmath26 .",
    "exact results are obtained on the properties related to the node strengths ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the analytical results match closely the empirical ones .",
    "in particular we find that @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 represents the ensemble average and @xmath47 is the strength of a node associated with the value @xmath30 of the normalized @xmath26 ) , @xmath48 $ ] ( where @xmath49 $ ] is the complete gamma function ) and that the pdf of the node strength is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 parameters related to the pdf of @xmath30 ( see auxiliary materials for details ) . from the empirical relation @xmath54",
    "it can be shown that the cumulative degree pdf decays exponentially as @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 summarize all the results discussed above .",
    "they show the excellent agreement of the fitness model with the empirical data .",
    "our theoretical framework is suitable to investigate future scenarios of the gvwtn structure . to this aim , we evaluate estimates of the annual rainfall for 2030 - 2050 from the a2 socio - economic scenario of the world climate research programmes ( wcrps ) coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 ( cmip3 ) multi - model dataset @xcite .",
    "the spatial mean is then calculated for each country in the network over this time horizon . then by using published projections of the @xmath24 and agricultural area @xcite for 2030 , we build the fitness functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the projections of the fitness variables at year @xmath62 .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are to be determined by the future total number of connections @xmath65 and flux @xmath66 . in our simulation we assumed that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but in general they may be part of the scenarios under study . all a2 climate change scenarios @xcite yield a decrease in rainfall at a global scale , but the total arable land is predicted by @xcite to increase around 1% , thereby leading to an increase of the total @xmath26 .",
    "figure 4 summarizes the results of the structure of the gvwtn under the driest climate change scenario .",
    "we find that the structure of the gvwtn topology is robust with respect to these particular scenarios . a heavier tail in the strengths pdf",
    "is observed suggesting a rich - gets - richer phenomenon @xcite , where the nodes with large strengths benefit from the changes in @xmath26 , becoming even stronger .",
    "we also find that the exponent in the node independent relation @xmath69 , ( where the vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the sorted degrees and strengths in the gvwtn ) increases from @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) to @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) ( see figure 3c and inset figure 4b ) .",
    "these results suggest that economic and climatic future scenarios will likely enhance the globalization of water resources , giving to water - rich countries even more inroad for reaching poorly connected nodes . at the same time",
    ", the observed rich - gets - richer phenomenon will intensify the reliance of most of the nations on the few vw hubs . as a consequence it will reduce the ability of the gvwtn to respond to disturbances whose impact may be dramatic when the vw trade supports carrying capacities beyond those supported by local resources @xcite .",
    "finally our study highlights how agricultural land management may indeed remarkably impact the future structure of the gvwtn .",
    "our work opens new quantitative and predictive perspectives in the study of stability and complexity of the gvwtn coupled to social , economic and political processes related to the international food trade .",
    "ongoing research incorporates scenarios where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are different from values of the year 2000 and reflect the evolving and dynamic character of the global network .",
    "our modelling scheme for the properties of the gvwtn employs : i ) a function describing the topological properties of the network , and ii ) a function , independent of i ) , characterizing its weights .",
    "the functional shape of @xmath76 , the probability that node @xmath11 and @xmath13  endowed respectively with fitness @xmath77 and @xmath78  are connected , is found through an entropy optimization principle and by imposing that all graphs with degree sequence @xmath79 appear in our ensemble with equal probability ( see auxiliary materials and @xcite for details ) .",
    "the result is @xmath80 the key assumption is that fitness variable @xmath77 is assumed to be the external quantity @xmath81 , determining the topological importance of node @xmath11 by driving the number of its connections . from eq .",
    "( [ pij ] ) one computes all topological properties ( defined in the auxiliary materials ) : the node degree @xmath82 ; the average degree of the nearest neighbors @xmath83 and the local clustering coefficient : @xmath84 a function @xmath85 assigns the average weight @xmath86 to the link connecting @xmath11 to @xmath13 as a function of the fitness variables @xmath30 .",
    "we interpret @xmath87 as a rank associated with the assigned link between two nodes @xmath11 and @xmath13 and its importance . by generalizing the concept of weighted configuration model @xcite ,",
    "our null hypothesis for @xmath85 is : @xmath88 where @xmath40 is the parameter controlling the total flux of the network .",
    "we choose as fitness variable @xmath30 the normalized rainfall on agricultural area @xmath89 .",
    "given the simple functional shape of eq .",
    "( [ qij ] ) , if an analytical approximation for the distribution of @xmath30 exists , exact results can be obtained on the properties involving node strengths .",
    "we find that the empirical cumulative distribution of @xmath30 is well fitted ( @xmath90 ) by a stretched exponential @xmath91 . then using the continuum approximation @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath92 , and for large enough @xmath93 one has : @xmath94\\frac{d}{ds}f^{-1}(s / n)=\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\rho(s/\\eta)$ ] , yielding : @xmath95 finally , the strength - strength correlation ia obtained as : @xmath96,\\ ] ] and it is found that it that does not depend on @xmath30 . although we are not able to repeat the same procedure for the fitness variable @xmath29 , a qualitative analytical behavior for the distribution of the node degree can be obtained by using the empirical relation @xmath97 through a derived distribution approach , i.e. @xmath98 .",
    "we then find : @xmath99 which is a compressed exponential distribution , confirming the exponential - like tail observed from the empirical analysis of the degree distribution .",
