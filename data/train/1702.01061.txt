    "diffusion is a universal phenomenon observed in diverse systems .",
    "it plays a crucial role not only in physical , chemical or biological setups but also its concept is used in socio - economical contexts in such processes like diffusion of ideas or innovations @xcite .",
    "over one hundred years ago einstein @xcite and smoluchowski @xcite formulated the theory of brownian motion which provides a link between the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopically observable diffusion . according to it , in thermal equilibrium",
    "the spreading of a cloud of independent brownian particles is more effective at higher temperature . but can diffusion even decrease with temperature ?",
    "after all , nature is prodigal in presenting sophisticated mechanisms that regulate phenomena which takes place in all scales of time and space .",
    "these control strategies reach the ultimate level of efficiency and refinement in biological systems which are responsible for the emergence of the sustainable phenomenon of life @xcite",
    ". a prominent example may be an intracellular transport mediated by molecular motors @xcite .",
    "it is an archetypal system , in which , even in the absence of externally applied bias , directed motion emerges by harvesting thermal fluctuations via the mechanism of breaking of spatio - temporal symmetries of the setup @xcite .    in view of the example considered in this paper",
    "we address the question whether it is possible to observe diffusion decreasing with temperature for the system far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "this peculiar behaviour should be clearly contrasted with the already renowned case of anomalous diffusion @xcite or the phenomenon of giant diffusion @xcite . to unravel the posed problem we study nonequilibrium dynamics of a brownian motor .",
    "the importance of the latter in science has become evident in the last two decades due to its widespread applications in both biological and non - biological , artificial systems @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 may be a non - monotonic function of temperature @xmath1 .",
    "initially @xmath0 increases as @xmath1 grows , passes through its local maximum and next starts to decrease reaching its local minimum to get larger with it later again",
    ". this counter - intuitive behaviour does not look like an exception and has been found in a variety of setups including cytoplasmic protein diffusion @xcite , zeolite - guest systems @xcite , polymer nanocomposites @xcite , @xmath2 mixtures at low temperature @xcite , nonuniform twisted vortex states in rotating superfluids @xcite , quasiparticles coupled to vibrations of a one - dimensional non - linear chain of atoms @xcite and finally extended disordered systems in contact with the phonon bath over complete range of a dissipation strength @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper with our relatively simple and clear model of a brownian motor we aim to explain the mechanism standing behind the mentioned peculiar diffusive behaviour .",
    "our finding is in some sense universal and can be realized both in classical and quantum setups ; in solid state physics as well as in soft matter ; in physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "the layout of the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe in detail a model of the periodically driven brownian motor moving on the asymmetric substrate and introduce all quantities of interest . in section iii , its deterministic counterpart is briefly analysed .",
    "for the considered parameter set , the system is non - chaotic and possesses three paramount attractors .",
    "next , in section iv , we show that for this regime , a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is observed . in section",
    "v we consider the distribution of the period averaged velocity in the regime of long time .",

    "it allows to explain the observed peculiar diffusive behaviour . to better visualize the proposed mechanism , in section vii we study spread of trajectories of the brownian motor .",

    "we consider an archetypal model of a brownian motor consisting of a classical inertial particle of mass @xmath5 , which moves in a spatially periodic ratchet - type potential @xmath6 , see .",
    "it is driven by an unbiased time periodic force @xmath7 of amplitude @xmath8 and angular frequency @xmath9 and subjected to thermal noise of intensity @xmath10 .",
    "dynamics of the particle is determined by the langevin equation , which in the dimensionless form reads @xmath11 the dot and the prime denote differentiation with respect to time @xmath12 and the particle coordinate @xmath13 , respectively . the dimensionless noise intensity @xmath14 is given by the ratio of thermal energy @xmath15 and a half of the activation energy the particle needs to overcome the original potential barrier @xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "23 for a complete overview of the scaling of the above equation .",
    "thermal fluctuations are modelled by @xmath18-correlated gaussian white noise of zero mean and unit intensity , i.e. @xmath19 the ratchet potential @xmath6 is assumed to be in the following form @xcite @xmath20 where the relative phase @xmath21 between two harmonics serves as a control parameter of the reflection - symmetry of this potential .",
    "it is reflection - symmetric when there exists a shift @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . if @xmath25 then the mirror symmetry is broken which we in turn classify as a ratchet potential .",

    "asymmetry of the potential can be controlled by the external magnetic field .",
    "we study a diffusion process of the particle position @xmath26 and the spread of trajectories .",

    "( [ model ] ) exhibits various forms of diffusion anomalies . in previous papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that for finite times , transient anomalous effects can occur .",
    "in particular , the mean square deviation @xmath36 initially evolves in a superdiffusive way , next subdiffusion is observed and finally it approaches normal diffusion behavior .",
    "it is worth to stress that lifetimes of the superdiffusion and subdiffusion can be many , many orders of magnitude longer than the characteristic time scale of the system and turns out to be extraordinarily sensitive to the system parameters like temperature or the potential asymmetry @xcite . in the the asymptotic long time limit @xmath37 , diffusion is always _",
    "normal_. in this paper , we study normal diffusion in the stationary states for @xmath37 with the well - defined diffusion coefficient @xmath0 determined by the relation ( [ d ] ) and analyze the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath0 on temperature .",
    "moreover , we reveal the mechanism standing behind the emergence of this phenomenon .    all three elements entering the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) are unbiased : the average of the potential force @xmath38 over the spatial period @xmath39 vanishes as well as that of the time dependent driving @xmath7 over a temporal period @xmath40 and also the mean value of the random force @xmath41 vanishes according to eq .",
    "( [ noise ] ) .",
    "however , due to the presence of the external driving the brownian particle is taken far away from thermal equilibrium and a time dependent nonequilibrium state is reached in the asymptotic long time regime . then the mean velocity @xmath42 takes the form of a fourier series over all possible harmonics @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the directed ( time independent ) transport velocity while @xmath45 denote time periodic higher harmonic functions of vanishing average over the fundamental period @xmath40 . in our setup , a necessary condition for the occurrence of directed transport @xmath46 is the breaking of the reflection symmetry of the potential @xmath6 @xcite which occurs for @xmath25 . due to this particular decomposition of the asymptotic long time average velocity",
    "it is useful to study also the period averaged velocity @xmath47 defined as @xmath48 which may be utilized to compute the directed transport velocity in the following way @xmath49    the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the model ( [ model ] ) can not be solved by any known analytical methods .",
    "therefore we performed comprehensive numerical simulations of the driven langevin dynamics .",

    "the three maxima in the distribution of the period averaged velocity concentrate around the deterministically coexisting attractors .",
    "this fact allows us to construct a three - state stochastic process with jumps between states induced by thermal equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "our goal is not to formulate and analyse this approximation in detail but rather to understand its basic properties . to this aim",
    ", we consider the influence of temperature variation on all transition probabilities between three states : @xmath80 , @xmath79 and @xmath82 .",
    "the notation @xmath87 is introduced for the conditional probability to remain staying in the plus state @xmath88 , next @xmath89 denotes the conditional probability of a transition between opposite running states @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the conditional probability of a transition between the plus and the zero state , @xmath92 .",
    "this naming convention is analogous for the other six conditional probabilities @xmath93 .",
    "these characteristics are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as a function of temperature of the system .",
    "we note that in the regime @xmath73 corresponding to the maximal diffusion coefficient differences between the probabilities are significant .",

    "is increased the differences between the transition probabilities are gradually disappearing and they are become equivalent",
    ". this fact again agrees with the form of the asymptotic probability distribution @xmath81 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) .",
    "then the particle frequently changes its state , however , the residence times for each of them are not sufficiently large to significantly modify spread of the trajectories and therefore the diffusion coefficient is smaller .     are depicted for different temperature of the system @xmath73 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath74 ( panel ( b ) ) . in panel",

    "now , in order to better visualize this qualitative mechanism we take a closer look at trajectories of the brownian motor .",
    "we first study the time evolution of the period averaged velocity @xmath47 . in we present an illustrative single trajectory of this observable .",
    "each dot depicts the period averaged velocity @xmath47 corresponding to the given period @xmath85 of the driving , i.e. @xmath101 . panel ( a ) pertains to the maximal diffusion coefficient for temperature @xmath73 .",
    "one can evidently notice that during the time evolution the particle stays predominantly in the plus state @xmath86 .",
    "however , from time to time it takes an excursion lasting for several dozens of the ac - driving periods to either the locked state @xmath99 or the running state @xmath100 with the opposite direction .",
    "this last situation particularly enlarges the spread of trajectories . on the other hand , in the case of high temperature @xmath74 and simultaneously minimal diffusion coefficient ( panel ( b ) ) the particle constantly jumps between these three states .",
    "while the difference between the period averaged velocities @xmath102 in two consecutive periods may be even greater than in the previous case it simply does not last sufficiently long to alter the overall spread of trajectories significantly .",
    "last but not least , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we depict various typical sample trajectories of the brownian particle coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "panel ( a ) relates to the regime of maximal diffusion coefficient for which temperature @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , one can denote there transitions between the three states @xmath82 , @xmath79 and @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , the long lasting periods of motion corresponding to the zero @xmath99 and the minus @xmath100 solutions significantly increase the overall spread of trajectories .",
    "most of the trajectories compactly follow the plus @xmath86 state but from time to time the particle jumps onto the other solution and stays there for many subsequent periods .",
    "this pictures agrees well with our previous statements deduced on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ( a ) .",
    "the situation is very different in panel ( b ) corresponding to the minimal diffusion coefficient for which temperature @xmath74 .",
    "there typical wiener process - like trajectories of infinitely many turns back and forth are observed .",
    "moreover , most of the trajectories oscillate around zero and there is no finite drift .",
    "their overall spread is also much smaller .",
    "note that scales of the vertical axes in panels ( a ) and ( b ) are different and spread of trajectories for time @xmath103 is more than 2000 in panel ( a ) and about 700 in panel ( b ) .",
    "in this work we investigated the diffusion in the archetypal model of the brownian motor , i.e the brownian particle moving in an asymmetric , one - dimensional periodic landscape of a ratchet type and subjected to an external unbiased time periodic force .",
    "we explain the mechanism standing behind the recently communicated anomaly @xcite whereby the diffusion coefficient is non - monotonic function of temperature of the system .",
    "if temperature is increased the diffusion constant describing the spreading rate of the particle cloud first increases until it reaches a local maximum and then decreases until a minimum is hit .",
    "further increase of temperature brings a continuous growth of the diffusion coefficient which eventually becomes proportional to it .    as the mechanism for this counter - intuitive diffusive behaviour",
    "we propose the temperature dependence of transitions between certain regions in the phase space dynamics of the motor .",
    "the latter contains in the deterministic case three non - chaotic attractors .",
    "two of them are running solutions corresponding to the opposite velocity @xmath104 and another one is the locked state @xmath105 .",
    "transition probabilities between these three states vary with temperature leading to the mentioned dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature .",
    "in particular , when the diffusion is maximal the particle most likely resides in the @xmath86 state .",
    "however , at the same time the transition probabilities for the particle to stay in the remaining states @xmath100 and @xmath99 are significantly larger than the rest of rates .",
    "therefore once the particle jumps from the state @xmath86 onto @xmath100 or @xmath99 it will remain there for a long time thus increasing spread of the trajectories and in turn also the diffusion coefficient . as temperature is increased the discrepancies between the transitions probabilities are gradually disappearing and they are become equivalent .",
    "then the particle jumps between the three states very frequently and the diffusion coefficient is smaller .    a similar behaviour has been recently detected in symmetric periodic systems ( sps ) @xcite .",
    "however , both systems are radically different . in ratchet systems like",
    "considered here , one can observe directed transport which is quantified by the asymptotic avegarged velocity @xmath46 while for sps there is no directed transport , i.e. the long - time averaged velocity is zero , @xmath106 . in the deterministic limit of zero temperature @xmath107 ,",
    "the system analyzed here is in a non - chaotic regime while the sps has been studied in a chaotic state indicating deterministic diffusion @xcite .",
    "the non - monotonic temperature dependence of diffusion was inseparably related to a few _ unstable _ periodic orbits embedded into a chaotic attractor together with thermal noise induced dynamical changes upon varying temperature . it should be contrasted with the operational regime of our present setup which is clearly non - chaotic with three coexisting attractors and three disjoint basins of attractions which are mutually inaccessible . in consequence ,",
    "the deterministic system is non - ergodic in the present case and transient anomalous diffusion can take place in the noisy system .",
    "therefore this paper presents an alternative mechanism standing behind this fascinating phenomenon .",
    "we note that it may occur also in symmetric systems possessing multiple deterministically coexisting attractors provided that the symmetry condition is still satisfied @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath0 on temperature has lately been studied in the system of brownian inertial particles moving in biased washboard potentials @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "locked and running states ( but only in one direction ) exist .",
    "the authors proposed a two - state theory incorporating the transition rates between the locked and running states which reproduces this non - monotonic behavior .",
    "finally , we remind that the langevin equation ( [ model ] ) has its physical realization as an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) subjected to a time - periodic current and pierced by an external magnetic flux .",
    "this asymmetric squid is formed by a superconducting loop with two resistively and capacitively shunted josephson junctions in the left arm and only one in the right arm @xcite .",
    "the quasi - classical dynamics of such systems is well known in the literature as the stewart - mccumber model @xcite .",
    "therefore our results can readily be experimentally tested with an accessible setup .",
    "we want to mention that in the previous paper @xcite , we have studied diffusion properties of the josephson phase in relation to quality of directed transport and in the chosen region of system parameters the diffusion coefficient , contrary to what is revealed this paper , is monotonically increasing function of temperature .    in view of the widespread applications of brownian motor setups and ratchet devices our research may bring along impact for further development of a working principle of a nanomotor operating on smallest scales occurring in diverse areas of science . among others ,",
    "one of the most promising aims is to harvest such nanomotors to convey powerful and efficient mechanisms that reach the ultimate effectiveness of biological systems which are responsible for the emergence and existence of the phenomenon of life .",

    "<S> we study diffusion properties of an inertial brownian motor moving on a ratchet substrate , i.e. a periodic structure with broken reflection symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the motor is driven by an unbiased time - periodic symmetric force which takes the system out of thermal equilibrium . for selected parameter sets , </S>",
    "<S> the system is in a non - chaotic regime in which we can identify a non - monotonic dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature : for low temperature , it initially increases as temperature grows , passes through its local maximum , next starts to diminish reaching its local minimum and finally it monotonically increases in accordance with the einstein linear relation . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting is the temperature interval in which diffusion is suppressed by thermal noise and we explain this effect in terms of transition rates of a three - state stochastic model .    </S>",

    "<S> our current understanding of nonequilibrium physics fundamentals still remains incomplete , undoubtedly far beyond what we know for equilibrium systems . </S>",
