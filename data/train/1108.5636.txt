    "entanglement represents the essence of quantum theory compared to the classical theories . with the development of quantum information science , entanglement",

    "the classification of entanglement is generally a mathematically difficult problem .",
    "it has been pointed out that only in a kind of tripartite system , which has a qubit as one of the subsystems ( @xmath2 ) , one may find finite number of entanglement classes @xcite .",
    "the complete entanglement classification of a @xmath2 pure system under stochastic local operation and classical communication ( slocc ) has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite , where canonical forms are constructed via jordan decomposition of the matrices .",
    "there the eigenvalues of the jordan forms serve as the continuous parameters in the entanglement classes @xcite . despite the great progress made in @xmath3 systems , in many classification schemes",
    "the classification of @xmath1 turns out to be a `` wild '' problem @xcite .",
    "attempts toward the classification of a multipartite system in literature mainly concentrate on its tensor ranks or local ranks of the tensor form of the quantum state , and there is still no systematic method for constructing the canonical form of @xmath0 under slocc in literature to our knowledge .",
    "recently , a method featured by the decomposition of the entanglement classification under local unitary transformations into different parts has been proposed @xcite . in this work , by decomposing entanglement classification into two complementary ingredients , we propose an entanglement classification scheme for a tripartite @xmath4 system under slocc .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , by representing the @xmath0 quantum state in the form of a three - way tensor , its entanglement classification under slocc is transformed into two correlated problems : the simultaneous similarity transformation of a commutating matrix pair into a canonical form and the representation of the symmetry of parameters in the canonical form . in sec .",
    "3 , a concrete example of entanglement classification for a @xmath1 system is given in which the explicit form of the symmetry property of the state is shown . a brief summary and concluding remarks are given in sec . 4 .",
    "considering a general tripartite pure quantum state with dimensions @xmath0 , the wave function can be written as @xmath5 are bases of the three parts respectively .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath6 can be treated as a three - order tensor which then turns into the form of a tuple of @xmath7 complex @xmath8 matrices , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 are @xmath8 complex matrices and have @xmath11_{jk}$ ] as their elements .",
    "a state @xmath12 is said to be slocc equivalent @xcite to @xmath13 in the case of @xmath14 here , @xmath15 ( where its elements are @xmath16 ) is an @xmath17 invertible matrix , i.e. , invertible local operator ( ilo ) acting on the first partite , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath8 ilos acting on the second and third partite , respectively .    for a tuple of matrices @xmath20 , there always exists a tuple of numbers @xmath21 @xmath22 , such that the linear combination of @xmath23s , @xmath24 gives the maximum rank , the @xmath25 .",
    "( we denote the rank of a matrix as @xmath26 hereafter . ) for every quantum state in the form of eq.([state - form - matrices ] ) , we can always transform them into the form where the @xmath27 has the maximum rank by performing the transformation @xmath15 , of which the first row is chosen to be the tuple of @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , in the following we can then restrict our discussion of the quantum state classification to that of the tuple @xmath29 , where @xmath27 has possessed the maximum rank .",
    "the strategy we adopt in the entanglement classification in this work is quite transparent , which can be roughly outlined as the manipulation of three commutative ilos @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 in different order and combination .",
    "we first transform the quantum state in a tuple of matrices according to specific rank property for each matrix by a subset of ilo @xmath15 , then obtain a canonical form by using ilos @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and finally achieve the entanglement classification by reconsidering the rest a subset of ilo @xmath15 as a degeneracy condition between the canonical forms .",
    "following , we explain in detail the classification procedures , in which two situations of matrix @xmath27 with full and nonfull ranks are discussed separately .      in this case , obviously every quantum state in form ( [ state - form - matrices ] ) can be transformed into the following form by ilos @xmath30 defined in eq.([tpq - def ] ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a unit matrix .",
    "then a subsequent ilo transformation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is one of the eigenvalues of @xmath23 , can always be applied to @xmath13 and makes @xmath35 after the transformation . by definition ,",
    "two such quantum states @xmath36 are equivalent under the transformations of ilos @xmath18 , @xmath19 if and only if @xmath37 which tells @xmath38 .",
    "equation ( [ pq - transform ] ) now turns into a simultaneous similarity relation of matrices @xmath39 , @xmath40 according to @xcite , all these kinds of problems can be transformed into the simultaneous similarity of a pair of commuting matrices , i.e. , eq.([pq - similarity ] ) is equivalent to @xmath41 where @xmath42 are composed by @xmath23 , and @xmath43=0 $ ] .",
    "this makes the entanglement classification of a @xmath1 system of great importance .",
    "the canonical form of eq.([pp - commut - pair ] ) under the similarity transformation can be written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the jordan form of @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the canonical form of @xmath48 , and @xmath49=0 $ ] .",

    "however , there still exist other transformation @xmath15s that can relate @xmath63 to another quantum state @xmath64 .",
    "the effect of the transformation @xmath15 is introducing a degeneracy on the canonical form of @xmath65 .",
    "that is , the states @xmath65 and @xmath66 with parametric difference may belong to the same entanglement class . define a set @xmath67 , which contains all the parameters in @xmath65 .",
    "the degeneracy can then be expressed as a symmetry transformation @xmath68 on the parameters of the canonical form , i.e. , @xmath69 thus , the canonical form is of the entanglement classification of the quantum state up to the symmetry @xmath68 .      in this case , all of the quantum states can be transformed into the following form by ilos @xmath30 @xmath70 here , @xmath71 has the following form : @xmath72 1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots   & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & \\cdots & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\hline 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots   & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\end{pmatrix } \\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 .",

    "can conclude that for each matrix triple @xmath90 , the following theorem holds :    the classification of @xmath0 can be represented in a triple - matrix form @xmath90 up to a parametric symmetry @xmath68 .",
    "now we note that the entanglement classification of quantum state @xmath91 under slocc can be decomposed into two problems : the simultaneous similarity transformation of a commutating matrix pair and the symmetry analysis of the corresponding canonical form .",
    "therefore the difficulty in entanglement classification then turns to that in the symmetry property study , which requires further analysis for different entanglement structures .",
    "analysis of the symmetry properties represents the essence of the entanglement class in our classification scheme . in the following",
    "we show the explicit form of symmetry in the classification of the @xmath1 quantum system , from which the symmetry nature of state @xmath92 can be figured out .",
    "in this section we give an explicit example of a @xmath1 system : @xmath93 , where @xmath94 ( full - rank case ) , and when transformed into @xmath95 via @xmath30 it has @xmath96 = 0 $ ] . from the discussion in sec .",
