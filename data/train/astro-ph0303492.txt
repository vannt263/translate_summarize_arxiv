    "the nearby ( @xmath1  pc ) binary (; ) is composed of two dm5.5e stars with similar masses and radii ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) in a highly eccentric orbit with a period of 26.5  y and a semi - major axis of @xmath4 ( @xmath5  au ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . the different radio behavior between uv cet a / b raises the obvious question of whether the x - ray properties of the two components are also different .",
    "although previous x - ray observatories lacked sufficient angular resolution to answer this question , it can now be addressed with _ chandra_. we present here the first spatially separated x - ray observation of uv ceti a / b .",
    "light curves and spectral emission lines were extracted for both components . a detailed analysis of the _ chandra _ data , and of _ xmm - newton _ and vla observations of uv ceti will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory observed the uv ceti binary for 75  ksec from 2001 november 26 at 20:55:39 ut to 2001 november 27 at 18:09:27 ut , with the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) inserted .",
    "this configuration provides grating spectra from 1.7 to 177     with a constant resolution of @xmath6     ( fwhm ) .",
    "the positive and negative order spectra are dispersed on the high - resolution camera ( hrc - s ) on each side of the focal aim point , and the latter provides a direct zeroth order image of the target in the energy range @xmath7  kev with an angular resolution of 0.4   ( fwhm ) .",
    "the hrc `` pixel '' size is @xmath8 .",
    "further details on the instruments can be found in the _",
    "chandra_.    we reduced level 2 files provided by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center , following recommended procedures with the ciao 2.2.1 software .",
    "the binary was aligned almost along the dispersion axis , and was separated in the grating spectra by about 80  m . this way , in the negative order spectrum",
    ", emission lines of uv cet a were shifted to shorter wavelengths relative to uv cet b , whereas they were shifted to longer wavelengths in the positive order .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the zeroth order image of the binary ; the astrometry is expected to be accurate within 1 .",
    "we used a sliding cell source detection algorithm with a fixed cell size of 6 pixels ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the components were separated by @xmath10 with uv ceti b lying at a position angle of @xmath11 relative to a. at the epoch of our observation , the orbital solution of @xcite gives a separation of @xmath12 and a position angle of @xmath13 , whereas the solution of @xcite gives @xmath14 and an angle of @xmath15 .",
    "our x - ray positions are therefore in excellent agreement with the expected optical positions .",
    "we extracted zeroth order light curves for each component using circular regions with radii of 5.5 pixels ( @xmath16 ) and applied dead - time corrections .",
    "the background contribution was estimated from nearby regions and was negligible ( @xmath17  ct  s@xmath18 , scaled to the source extraction region ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the x - ray light curves for both components . obviously , uv cet b was highly variable and showed at least five large flares , while uv cet a only showed a gradual rise and fall at the start of the observation .",
    "the small flare in uv cet a occurring simultaneously with the large flare in uv cet b is an artifact due to flux contamination from component b to component a. the two stars had a similar low - level x - ray count rate ( excluding the five large flares , see fig .",

    "uv cet b displayed two types of flares : the first type is characterized by a slow increase and a slow decay , with similar time scales .",
    "the second flare type is reminiscent of `` impulsive '' solar flares , with a rapid rise and a slower decay .",
    "both flare types however share similar total durations of @xmath21  s. the peak count rate of the giant flare in uv cet b is about a factor of 100 over the low - level count rate ( @xmath22  erg  s@xmath18 ; for a 1.37  kev plasma in pimms ) ; the flare has a very short rise time of 80  s , and returns to the preflare level after @xmath23  s ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a secondary peak occurs during the decay phase of the first flare , perhaps indicating the occurrence of a second flare .",
    "we present in this section a discussion of the _ chandra _ letgs spectra of uv ceti a and b. in this paper , our analysis focuses on the low - level emission ( 50.8  ksec ) , however we do note that emission lines from higher ionization stages of fe ( e.g. , and in the 10 - 12     range ) were seen during flares .",
    "the selected time intervals for the low - level emission are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the full _ chandra _ positive and negative order spectra during the low - level emission .",
    "since the latter is faint ( a total of 0.11  ct  s@xmath18   in the dispersed spectra ) , only a few bright emission lines have been positively detected .",
    "the low - level x - ray spectra of uv cet a and b are similar .",
    "they show the strongest emission in the  ly@xmath24 line .",
    "emission lines from , , , , , are also detected below 40   .",
    "the range of temperatures over which these lines form indicates that there is significant emission measure ( em ) in the range @xmath25  mk , which is confirmed by electron temperature diagnostics such as line ratios .",
    "reliable density measurements could not be obtained because of low fluxes in the closely - spaced he - like triplets and line blending ( see , e.g. , panels b and d in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . at longer wavelengths",
    "( @xmath26   ) , the signal - to - noise ratio was insufficient to significantly detect emission lines .",
    "we derived upper limits to fluxes of fe l - shell lines with typical large emissivities , such as @xmath27 93.92   , @xmath27 108.37   , @xmath27 128.73   , / @xmath27 132.85   , @xmath27 171.07   , and @xmath27 174.53   .",
    "the absence of detectable emission from these lines suggests that there is no significant em at high ( @xmath28  mk ) or low ( @xmath29  mk ) temperatures .",
    "we fitted the positive and negative order spectra simultaneously with two monochromatic emission lines per feature ( for uv cet a and b ) folded through the _ chandra _ line response function . in the negative order spectrum , the model line wavelengths were shifted by @xmath30  m   to account for the wavelength discrepancy between the positive and negative order spectra with ciao 2.2.1 .",
    "the emission lines from uv cet a and b were separated by a fixed 80  m .",
    "first order grating as provided by the letgs calibration team were used .",
    "line emissivities from apec 1.2 @xcite were used to calculate the em loci curves .",
    "we assumed that the coronal abundances in uv cet a and b were identical to the solar photospheric abundances @xcite .",
    "the line fluxes were not corrected for interstellar absorption , since it is very small ( @xmath31  @xmath32 , based on the canonical interstellar density @xmath33  @xmath34 , @xcite ) , even at the long wavelength end of the letgs ( @xmath35% absorption at 170   ) .",
    "we provide em loci of uv cet a and b in figure  [ fig5 ] ; em loci of detected fe lines ( solid curves ) and of detected other elements ( dotted curves ) are shown with 68% confidence ranges at the maximum formation temperatures ( @xmath36 ) , suggesting that ne and o are overabundant relative to fe .",
    "upper limits ( 90% confidence ranges ) for the em loci of undetected fe lines ( dashed curves ) are also shown with arrows at @xmath36 .",
    "we have checked the consistency of our upper limits with the archival _ euve _ data of uv cet . since this paper aims at presenting the new _ chandra _ results , we present here only a summary of the _ euve _ analysis .",
    "the uv cet binary was observed during a time span of 885  ksec , with an effective exposure of about 230  ksec .",
    "its deep survey ( ds ; 65190   ) light curve displayed strong variability with several short flare - like events .",
    "we extracted the short wavelength ( sw ; 70190   ) spectrum during the low - level emission ( ds count rates lower than 0.1  ct  s@xmath18 ; exposure of 188  ksec ) , and compared the line fluxes with those in the _ chandra _ letgs spectrum .",
    "we emphasize that _ euve _ could not separate the binary spatially and spectroscopically .",
    "only two lines were detected , the / @xmath27 132.85     blend , and the @xmath27 93.92     line ; their measured fluxes were @xmath37  ph  @xmath32  s@xmath18   and @xmath38  ph  @xmath32  s@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the sum of the upper limits for uv cet a / b obtained from the letgs ( @xmath27 132.85   : @xmath39 and @xmath40  ph  @xmath32  s@xmath18 , @xmath27 93.92   : @xmath41 and @xmath39  ph  @xmath32  s@xmath18 , for uv cet a and b , respectively ) are compatible with the measured fluxes in _ euve _ sw .",
    "the other fe l - shell lines formed at high or low temperature ( see previous paragraph ) remain undetected by _ euve _ , and their upper limits are also consistent with our _ chandra _ upper limits .",
    "numerous radio observations of the uv ceti binary system have shown that the coronae of both components differ significantly .",
    "the non - flaring radio emission of the primary is much weaker than that of the secondary and often remains undetected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their flares also are different : on uv cet a , flares are often highly circularly polarized , thus suggesting some coherent emission mechanism @xcite , whereas flares in uv cet b often show only weak or moderate polarizations consistent with gyrosynchrotron emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and occur more frequently than flares in the primary .",
    "the contrasting behavior in the radio is peculiar since the two stars are otherwise thought to be very similar , with almost identical masses and radii .",
    "a study of their spatially separated x - ray emissions thus promises to uncover differences in the coronal energy release behavior of the two stars .",
    "uv cet a did not display any strong x - ray variability , while uv cet b was on average twice as luminous as the primary , essentially because it displayed a higher flare rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , top panel ) .",
    "the radio emission is due to the production of high - energy electrons during the flare process .",
    "gyrosynchrotron emission would , under solar - like conditions , decay rapidly due to radiation and collisional losses ( within minutes ) .",
    "however , if extended , weak magnetic fields were present , then part of the relativistic electron population produced during the detected large x - ray flares could be efficiently trapped for durations much longer than the characteristic time between large flares since @xmath42 for synchrotron losses .",
    "spatially resolved vlba observations support such a model for uv cet b ( whereas no extended structure was identified in the primary ) .",
    "@xcite inferred magnetospheric structures around uv cet b several times larger than the star , and from the decay time of a gradual flare ( @xmath43  s ) they inferred magnetic field strengths of only a few tens of gauss . based on this observation , @xcite further proposed a magnetic trap model that would at the same time explain steady radio and x - ray emission .",
    "in contrast to the quasi - steady radio emission of each component , the quasi - steady x - ray count rates of the two components are similar",
    ". a closer look at the _ chandra _ low - level light curve of uv cet b ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , middle panel ) shows that its `` quiescent '' emission is in fact flickering and is composed of numerous temporally resolved flares , with a possible quasi - steady emission not exceeding 0.01  ct  s@xmath18   or 30% of the average low - level emission .",
    "it may well be that the entire x - ray emission is a superposition of the detected flare decays , including very small events .",
    "this could be similar for the x - ray emission of uv cet a ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) . accelerated electrons from these flares can further add to the quasi - steady radio emission , but they are particularly well trapped in the extended magnetosphere of uv cet b. _ xmm - newton _ data of the dm5.5e star proxima centauri have yielded similar results ; its quiescent x - ray emission was temporally resolved into a continual sequence of weak flares @xcite . these results provide strong support for the hypothesis that low - energy flares contribute significantly to the coronal heating in stars @xcite .",
    "in the sun , flares with small energies contribute a significant amount to the total coronal heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in conclusion , the radio and x - ray behaviors of uv cet a and b are strikingly different .",
    "vlba measurements have revealed an extended magnetosphere around uv cet b only , and _ chandra _ shows that the b component displays a harder distribution of x - ray flares .",
    "such flares may repeatedly produce and trap electrons in the extended magnetosphere at a rate sufficient to sustain the quasi - steady radio emission .",
    "given the similar masses and spectral types of the binary components , it is yet unclear why their coronal behavior should differ .",
    "stellar rotation may play an important role , since coronal activity is roughly proportional to the rotation rate .",
    "infrared spectroscopy has recently shown that uv cet a rotates relatively fast ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath18 ; @xcite ) , but no measurement is yet available , to our knowledge , for uv cet b. the physical causes responsible for the disparate coronal behaviors of these two stars remain yet unexplained , however the answer to this question may provide important information on the generation and sustainment of magnetic fields in late - type stars .",
