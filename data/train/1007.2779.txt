    "our understanding of the structuring of the penumbral magnetic field has increased significantly over the last two decades .",
    "three seminal works were published back in 1993 . using filter magnetograms",
    ", @xcite found that the magnetic field inclination fluctuated by as much as @xmath118 degrees ( rms ) on azimuthal paths around the spot center .",
    "@xcite , using spectropolarimetric data , identified the same fluctuations in the magnetic field , but this time in both inclination and field strength .",
    "the sense of the correlation found was that horizontal field lines tended to a have a weaker field strength . in both works ,",
    "the well known evershed flow was observed to be concentrated in the horizontal component .",
    "simultaneously , @xcite proposed a model , commonly referred to as the uncombed model , of vertically interlaced magnetic field components to explain the properties of the observed net circular polarization .",
    "the discovery of dark cored penumbral filaments by @xcite , once a resolution of @xmath201 was reached , led to the development of new models trying to explain the structure of penumbral filaments . among them we can cite the flux pumping mechanism @xcite , the misma model @xcite , and the `` gappy '' model @xcite .",
    "for a detailed overview we refer to recent reviews of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "many penumbral models @xcite share the geometry of the uncombed penumbral model : nearly horizontal magnetic flux tubes embedded in a stronger and more vertical background field . throughout the article we will refer them as the uncombed scenario . in the frame of this scenario , several observational properties of sunspot penumbrae , like the filamentary structure , the strong evershed outflow , and the uncombed geometry can be easily explained . besides , it explains the properties of the observed net circular polarization @xcite .",
    "recently the uncombed scenario has been modified , see @xcite , to make it compatible with a possible existence of convective motions inside penumbral filaments as pointed out by recent observations @xcite .",
    "one open question in the uncombed scenario is how the penumbral continuum intensity can be as large as 75% of the normal quiet sun brightness ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is interesting to note that the simulations by @xcite can explain up to 50 % of the quiet sun intensity if the evershed flow consists of horizontal flow channels with a length of several mm that bring hot material from deeper layers .",
    "indeed , the problem of the penumbral heating was a strong motivation for @xcite and @xcite to propose the gappy penumbral model , in which field - free overturning convection occurs inside the penumbra and efficiently heats its atmosphere .",
    "however , this model has not yet been confronted to spectropolarimetric observations . in particular , it is unclear if this model is able to reproduce the observed net circular polarization .",
    "however , for that to happen , the magnetic field inside the filaments should be around 1000 g , which seems to be incompatible with the concept of a field - free gap @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed the possibility of strongly reduced ( although non - zero ) magnetic field inside the field - free gap .",
    "these modifications of both scenarios , uncombed ( including convection inside flux tubes ) and gappy ( including significant magnetic field inside the field - free gaps ) , could in the end produce similar observational effects , although they are based on different physical mechanisms .",
    "simulations based on radiative magneto - convection in inclined magnetic fields can help to shed light on open questions .",
    "first attempts to simulate penumbral structure in small slab - like sections of sunspots @xcite resulted in rather narrow penumbral regions .",
    "recent numerical simulations by @xcite seem to reproduce many observational properties of penumbral filaments : e.g. the filamentary structure of the penumbra , the evershed flow , some supersonic velocities ( although the observed ones are certainly more complex , see e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the correlation between inclination and strength of the magnetic field , and the penumbral brightness . nevertheless , the resulting penumbra is still somewhat immature , revealing too short and too fragmented filaments .",
    "dark lanes along bright filaments observationally found by @xcite form only occasionally . at present , these simulations do not allow a direct comparison with spectropolarimetric observations , since up to our knowledge no synthesized spectra are available . surprisingly , the simulated penumbrae share some properties with both the uncombed and the gappy scenarios : i.e. convective motions inside zones harboring nearly horizontal and relatively strong ( around 1 kg ) magnetic fields . the vertical slices across a penumbral filament taken from a snapshot of rempel et al s simulations and presented in figure 1 of @xcite point to the co - existence of significant magnetic fields _ and _ overturning velocities .",
    "observationally , 3d visualizations of penumbral filaments can only be obtained from inversions of spectropolarimetric data ( in the absence of robust results from local helioseismology , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while milne - eddington inversions only yield the physical parameters at an average optical depth @xcite , more sophisticated inversion codes like sir @xcite or spinor @xcite provide the stratification of physical parameters in an optical depth scale .",
    "several 3d optical depth models have been published in the recent past ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the highest spatial resolution input data for this endeavor are currently provided by the crisp imaging spectropolarimeter ( crisp , * ? ? ? * ) and by the hinode / sp spectropolarimeter ( lites et al .",
    "2001 , see also tsuneta et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the near future",
    "the gregor fabry perot interferometer ( gfpi , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its full stokes polarimeter @xcite @xmath3 reveal spectropolarimetric data at even higher spatial resolution once gregor @xcite is in operation .",
    "the ground based 2d observations take advantage of image reconstruction techniques ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to improve spatial resolution and to reduce spatial crosstalk from variable seeing .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have carried out inversions of hinode data and found an atmosphere that is basically consistent with the uncombed scenario : horizontal channels carrying the evershed flow are substantially magnetized .",
    "these channels appear at large optical depths , but no information about geometrical heights is obtained .    given the highly fluctuating densities that are expected in the penumbra , the interpretation of an optical depth scale as a good approach for geometrical heights can be misleading and a reliable transformation to geometrical heights is mandatory .",
    "besides , to establish a geometric height scale is important for the determination of the electrical current vector @xmath4 that is crucial for the determination of ohmic energy dissipation , and for a test of the reliability of _ ab initio _ mhd simulations .",
    "while traditionally in quiet sun the transformation from an optical depth scale to a geometric one has been done by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is not justified in the magnetized penumbra .",
    "the force balance in this case must include magnetic forces which require the calculation of horizontal _ and _ vertical spatial derivatives of the magnetic field .",
    "an absolute geometrical height scale for penumbrae has been derived by @xcite from a spectropolarimetric inversion under the misma hypothesis by imposing equal total pressure between adjacent pixels , although neglecting the magnetic tension in the lorentz force .",
    "@xcite obtained the stratification of physical quantities in geometrical height applying a neural network inversion technique based on mhd simulations of quiet sun .",
    "the application of this technique on sunspot penumbrae might be straight forward , using e.g. the simulations of @xcite as input .",
    "the main objective of the work presented here is to infer a 3d geometrical model of the penumbra by imposing the solenoidality of the magnetic field and the dynamic equilibrium including the lorentz force .",
    "this model allows the determination of the wilson depression at each pixel , the correlation of physical quantities at each height , and the evaluation of the energy budget transferred by mass motions .",
    "the active region ar 10953 near solar disk center was observed using the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) on - board the hinode spacecraft on the 1@xmath5 of may 2007 , between 10:46 and 12:25 ut . the region was scanned with a step size of 0148 and a slit width corresponding to 0158 , recording the full stokes vector of the pair of the neutral iron lines at 630 nm with a spectral sampling of 21.53 m .",
    "the spatial resolution was about 032 .",
    "the integration time was 4.8s , resulting in a noise level of approximately 1.2@xmath610@xmath7 .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done assuming that the average umbral profile does not exhibit velocities .    for reasons of simplicity",
    "this article centers on a section of the inner penumbra of the large sunspot presented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the analyzed area is marked by a white rectangle centered at an heliocentric angle @xmath8=4.63@xmath9 .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction to disk center . in figure",
    "coordinates , the disk center would be at @xmath10=-5.5 mm and @xmath11=74 mm .",
    "this area has been chosen because it consists of homogeneous and radial aligned filaments . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the map of stokes v at + 286 m   from the line center . in this map ,",
    "the black points correspond to pixels in which the magnetic field shows a reverse polarity and harbors strong downflows @xcite .",
    "the area analyzed in this paper does not include such points .",
    "nevertheless , provided that these strong downflows are mainly located in the mid and outer penumbra , the results of this paper can be considered representative for the inner penumbra . in a posterior paper",
    "we will apply the method described in this article to the entire sunspot .",
    "to derive the physical parameters of the solar atmosphere as a function of continuum optical depth , i.e. temperature @xmath12 ) , magnetic field strength @xmath13 , field inclination @xmath14 , field azimuth @xmath15 , and line of sight velocity @xmath16 , the sir inversion code @xcite was applied on the spectropolarimetric data set . in the region of the inner center - side penumbra under study ,",
    "all stokes profiles are slightly asymmetric , are not multi - lobed and do not show strong displacements .",
    "consequently , there is not sufficient information to obtain a two - component atmosphere unambiguously .",
    "therefore , we use an one - component inversion to obtain the stratification of plasma parameters in each pixel .",
    "the same procedure has already been applied on sunspot penumbral data observed with the hinode / sp by e.g. @xcite .",
    "the spectropolarimeter on - board hinode allows us to distinguish the fine structure of the penumbra with a resolution of 03 .",
    "the dark cored penumbral filaments discovered by @xcite , with a typical size less than 01 , could indicate the existence of smaller physical structures , but could also be generated by temperature differences present in iso - tau layers above large structures like flux tubes @xcite or field - free gaps @xcite . in any case ,",
    "our results have to be interpreted as the averaged properties of structures on a scale of 03 .",
    "the free physical parameters are calculated by sir at different optical depth points ( nodes ) .",
    "we have chosen 5 nodes in @xmath17 , 3 nodes in @xmath13 and @xmath16 , and 2 nodes in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the final temperature stratification is obtained by spline interpolation .",
    "we have used a parabolic interpolation for @xmath13 and @xmath16 and linear interpolation in case of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . we have neither considered microturbulent velocities nor stray light contamination .",

    "the error bars calculated at the different nodes are also shown .",
    "the sunspot has negative polarity ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we do not perform any correction of the azimuth to solve the 180@xmath9 ambiguity , since all resulting azimuth values are in the range between @xmath9 and 90@xmath9 showing a smooth spatial variation across the field of view ( fov ) .",

    "clearly , the visible lines used in this work are nearly insensible to physical parameters at layers deeper than -75 km , i.e. , the stratification of temperature , density , pressure and velocity at such layers result from linear extrapolations ( in the original log(@xmath38 ) scale ) ; and so the results at these layers can be considered only qualitatively . in panel",
    "( a ) of figure  [ flujomedio ] we plot the energy flux carried by the vertical motion of the solar plasma between -225 km and 200 km , averaged over the penumbral region studied here .",
    "the total contribution of the energy flux in the full height range amounts to 78.7% of the solar flux , a value near the average brightness of a sunspot penumbra .",
    "the contribution to the energy flux of layers probed by the visible lines is also plotted ( in blue ) . at these layers ,",
    "the error bars have been calculated by a monte carlo simulation from the uncertainties of the physical quantities produced by the inversion method and the genetic algorithm . in order to understand why only layers between -180 km and 20 km appreciatively contribute to the energy flux , we plot in panel ( b ) of figure  [ flujomedio ] the mean temperature gradient ( black ) and the mean adiabatic temperature gradient ( red ) averaged over the region under study .",
    "the strong increase of the uncertainties of these gradients with depth reflects the above mentioned insensitivity of the lines under study at deeper layers .",
    "nevertheless , below 0 km the temperature gradient is seen to be steeper than the adiabatic one , thus at these layers the ascending matter transfers energy to the surroundings .",
    "apart from temperature gradients , it is necessary to take into account density , vertical velocity and specific heat stratification : in panel ( c ) of figure  [ flujomedio ] , we plot @xmath132@xmath135@xmath51 ( black ) , i.e. the height derivative of the energy flux carried by the vertical component of the plasma motion under constant pressure conditions .",

    "we can understand in the light of this figure why layers above -200 km are heated by the ascending material .        in panel ( d ) of figure",
    "[ flujomedio ] , we present the height derivative of the energy flux carried by the vertical component of the plasma motion in units of the solar flux evaluated as the difference between the black and red line of panel ( c ) , which is essentially the average of equation  ( [ fe ] ) .    another important parameter , which can be evaluated once the absolute geometrical height scale is known , is the wilson depression , i.e. the depth where the continuum optical depth equals 1 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath52 allows us to study which penumbral features are elevated or depressed . in figure",
    "[ zw ] we present the map of @xmath52 .",
    "areas harboring significant up - flows ( enclosed by the iso - velocity lines ) correspond to elevated structures ( @xmath52@xmath132100 km ) .",
    "when comparing with figure  [ paramphys ] , a good correlation with the different physical quantities is apparent . for a quantitative analysis of this correlation",
    ", scatter plots of @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath23 _ vs. _ the wilson depression are depicted in figure  [ scatter_zw ] for several geometrical heights .",
    "we observe a strong correlation between temperature @xmath22 and @xmath52 : in places with higher @xmath22 , @xmath27=0 is displaced to upper layers due to the strong dependence of opacity with temperature ( in agreement with the results found by * ? ? ?",
    "note that , as stated above , the @xmath0=200 km layer is nearly isotherm .",
    "furthermore , for depressed areas ( e.g. @xmath52@xmath51150 km ) the difference in temperature between the heights of 0 km and 200 km is only @xmath2500k , while for elevated areas ( e.g. @xmath52@xmath1320 km ) , temperature differences of the order of 2000k between both layers are reached .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath24 shows a very weak correlation with @xmath52 : lower @xmath52 tends to be related to weaker magnetic fields . nevertheless , we find clear trends between field inclination @xmath25 and the wilson depression , at all layers .",
    "the same behavior is observed in case of the vertical component of velocity @xmath60 . in figure  [ paramphys ]",
    "we have plotted the points corresponding to pixels harboring significant upflows ( in red ) .",
    "focusing on the distribution of red points throughout the panels , we can conclude that the evershed flow corresponds to areas with decreased wilson depression ( elevated structures ) , hotter temperatures , and weaker and more horizontal magnetic fields . the mean value and the standard deviation of the wilson depression in areas with stronger ascending velocities ( @xmath119@xmath510.3kms@xmath120 ) , amount to 34km@xmath157 km , while in the remaining areas values of 122km@xmath182 km are retrieved : i.e. features harboring the evershed flow are in average clearly elevated .",
    "the zero in the @xmath0-scale ( and consequently the zero of the wilson depression ) is arbitrary .",
    "since the area where the genetic algorithm has been applied did not include the surroundings of the spot , an absolute scale with respect to the quiet photosphere was not directly inferred from our analysis .",
    "however , such an absolute scale can be established in the following way .",
    "if we assume that the central part of the umbra has a wilson depression of 600 km @xcite with an inclination of 180 degrees , a linear continuation of the data points in the third panel of the upper row in figure  [ scatter_zw ] ( see linear fit ) establishes our mean umbral @xmath38=1 level at 500 km , suggesting that our 0 km reference level is @xmath2100 km depressed with respect to the normal quiet sun .",
    "this indicates that our mean wilson depression over the fov ( 94@xmath186 km in our scale ) corresponds to a depression of @xmath2194 km with respect to the surrounding quiet sun atmosphere .",
    "this value is in agreement with previous estimates of the wilson depression at the inner penumbra @xcite .",
    "using a genetic algorithm we have established a common geometrical height scale for photospheric penumbral models resulting from sir inversions of hinode data . although the genetic algorithm only minimizes @xmath55 and the deviations from static equilibrium in the equation of motion at a height of 200 km , the resulting atmospheric model , interpolated to a common @xmath0-scale , shows very small @xmath55 values ( and in any case , always inside the calculated error bars ) in a height range from 50 km to 200 km .",
    "the horizontal derivatives of the divergence are of similar magnitude to that of the vertical one .",
    "however , the latter has a mean value ( 0.2g / km ) that can not be compensated by the mean values of the horizontal derivatives .",
    "this shows that , even at hinode resolutions of 0.3 ( 200 km ) , the penumbra displays unresolved structure .",
    "this unresolved structure can be present in both horizontal and vertical directions . in the first case , improved spatial resolution should reduce the mean value of the vertical derivative . in the second case , the only way to achieve better resolution in the @xmath0-direction , would be by including more spectral lines in the inversion .",
    "having at our disposal a common geometrical height scale , we can evaluate e.g. electric currents ( which will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper ) , the wilson depression , and in general the three dimensional structure of penumbral features .",
    "the results show a significant correlation between the different physical quantities . owing to the visible photospheric lines used , we are only able to reliably probe the penumbra in the range from @xmath20 km to @xmath2200 km . at deep layers , strong spatial contrast in all parameters",
    "is found , whereas at the highest layers both velocities and temperatures are nearly spatially homogeneous .",
    "penumbral filaments with strong upflows have a weaker and more horizontal magnetic field , are hotter and more dense and exhibit a @xmath38=1 surface displaced to higher layers .",
    "all these properties fit into the picture proposed by the uncombed scenario .",
    "we point out that at the resolution of the hinode / sp there is no trace of field - free regions in the penumbral volume retrieved by observations ( pixel volume of @xmath2200@xmath137km@xmath137 ) .",
    "our inversions show kg field strength at all points inside this penumbral volume .",
    "we do not find traces of overturning convection in the inner penumbral area analyzed : the mass flow evaluated at three different height layers is clearly dominated by upflows , the amount of ascending material being five times larger than the descending one .",
    "this results might certainly change when analyzing the mid and outer penumbra due to the presence of strong downflow patches as found by @xcite .    besides , the observed upward motion , here identified as the vertical component of the evershed flow , seems to carry enough energy to explain the brightness of the penumbra if the physical quantities below @xmath0=-75 km are extrapolated from the results of the inversion .    as the method presented here has been applied so far only on a small penumbral region its extension on the entire sunspot penumbra , including the umbra and moat regions , will be addressed in a future work . +",

    "<S> we do not find evidence of overturning convection or field free regions in the inner penumbral area analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the penumbral brightness can be explained by the energy transfer of the ascending mass carried by the evershed flow , if the physical quantities below @xmath0=-75 km are extrapolated from the results of the inversion . </S>"
