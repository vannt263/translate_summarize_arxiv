    "optical and hi studies of interacting galaxies ( e.g. hibbard & van gorkom 1996 , duc & mirabel 1998 ) have shown that dwarf galaxies may be produced during galactic collisions .",
    "duc & mirabel ( 1998 ) have presented an especially convincing case of ngc 5291 , where more than ten star - forming high - metallicity dwarf galaxies may have been formed in a recent merger .",
    "these newly formed tidal - dwarf galaxies may be good sites to study galaxy formation in the nearby universe .",
    "although the concept of the formation of self - gravitating objects in tidal tails is an old one , considered by zwicky as early as in 1956 , it is only recently that these objects have received more attention and have been searched for systematically .",
    "hi observations have so far been the principal means used in searches of tidal dwarf galaxies since these are usually gas - rich systems .",
    "hi maps can reach large radii but have the disadvantage of being ( mostly ) of too poor spatial resolution for a direct investigation of the velocity field of the spatially - small and low - velocity - dispersion objects ( typically 5 - 20 arcsec in extent , and velocity gradients of 2  20 km s@xmath3 arcsec@xmath3 ; duc , 1995 ) .",
    "the study of the kinematics of the _ ionized _ gas of a galaxy , when it is present , with high spatial and spectral resolution velocity maps , can alternatively provide a useful tool to probe the nature of the candidate dwarf galaxies at small scales , complementing the lower - resolution radio studies .",
    "this paper presents new data on the kinematics of the ionized gas for seven star - forming tidal dwarf galaxy candidates and many other giant hii regions of stephan s quintet .",
    "combining fabry perot h@xmath0 maps with deep b and r images , we study the photometric and kinematic properties of 23 emission - line regions of the group .",
    "stephan s quintet ( arp 319 , vv288 , hcg 92 ) has been the subject of studies in x - rays , radio continuum , hi and h@xmath0 .",
    "most of its gaseous material is not concentrated around the bright galaxies but in the intragroup medium , suggesting that collisions among the group members may have taken place .",
    "arp ( 1973 ) was the first to obtain an h@xmath0 image of the group and to identify hii regions around galaxies n7318a , b , n7319 and n7320 .",
    "as part of an imaging survey of compact groups , in the r band , hunsberger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) identified 27 tidal dwarf galaxy candidates possibly associated with n7318a , b and n7319 .",
    "one of these regions was observed by xu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to be a bright infrared source , when observed with the iso satellite ( their source a ) .",
    "xu et al . ( 1999 ) also presented h@xmath0 + [ nii ] images of the group highlighting the spatial overlap of the two emission clouds of ionized gas in the intragroup medium centered around 5700 km s@xmath3 and 6700 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a similar result was found by plana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on fabry - perot h@xmath0 maps .",
    "an interesting possible scenario for the interaction history of stephan s quintet has been put forward by shostak et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and refined by moles et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the scenario is based on the analysis of optical images of the quintet , spectroscopy of a number of systems ( moles et al .",
    "1998 ) and hi maps which show three velocity components associated with the group , at @xmath6 5700 km s@xmath3 , 6000 km s@xmath3 and 6700 km s@xmath3 ( balkowski et al .",
    "1973 , allen & sullivan 1980 , shostak et al .",
    "1984 ) . in their scenario ,",
    "one or more major collisions occurred between n7320c and n7319 ( at velocities @xmath6 6000 km s@xmath3 and @xmath6 6700 km s@xmath3 respectively ) , which may have resulted in the removal of the hi gas from the inner parts of n7319 .",
    "more recently , stephan s quintet would have received a new member , n7318b ( it has a radial velocity of 5774 km s@xmath3 while the other core - group members , n7317 , n7318a and n7319 , have a mean velocity of 6664 km s@xmath3 , hickson et al .",
    "n7318b would be entering the group for the first time and it would be colliding with the intragroup medium ( moles et al .",
    "we identify a number of possible tidal dwarf galaxy candidates most probably formed as a result of the ongoing collision that involves n7318b .",
    "only one of the candidates studied here may be associated with the collision n7320c  n7319 and hence the hi cloud removed from the center of n7319 .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the latter originated from n7318a ( see sections 4.7 and 4.8 ) .",
    "all the regions we measure in this work have been previously identified as hii regions by arp ( 1973 ) .",
    "a number of them have also been listed by hunsberger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as tidal dwarf galaxy candidates and gallagher et al .",
    "( 2000 , using hst images ) as massive cluster candidates . however , these studies did not have velocity information .",
    "radial velocity information for some of the regions is summarized in table 1 of plana et al .",
    "determination of the velocity gradients within the regions is the main contribution of the present work .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and reduction procedure . in section 3",
    ", we present the new photometric and kinematic results . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the results and section 5 summarizes the paper . throughout this paper h@xmath9",
    "is the hubble constant in units of h@xmath13 = 75 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "we assume that all the regions are at the same distance , and the differences in cz are just kinematical . for the figures and the determination of the star - formation rates we assumed a distance to the group of 80 mpc , for an average velocity of 6000 km s@xmath3 and a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "the observations were carried out with a scanning fabry - perot instrument mounted on the canada - france - hawaii 3.6 m telescope ( cfht ) and the russian sao 6 m telescopes .",
    "the observations and characteristics of the set - ups are summarized in table 1 . during the cfht",

    "we , therefore , did not detect the 6700 km s@xmath3 velocity component of the group .",

    "the motion observed in hi encompasses an area that goes from the base of the northern tail of n7318b to our region 1 and it has a very similar mean radial velocity ( @xmath6 6000 km s@xmath3 ) to that of the h@xmath0 emission in complex 25 .",

    "the ratio v@xmath54/v@xmath43 is , then , well below 2.5 for both galaxies , indicating that they may develop tidal tails during collisions .",

    "although the complex of regions 25 may not survive as a single entity ( the tidal mass is very large mainly because of the large radius of the complex ) , it may be split into several smaller candidates which could then survive the tidal forces exerted by n7318b .",
    "the hi map of stephan s quintet presented by williams et al .",
    "( 1999 , their fig .",
    "5 ) shows that the hi component at velocity 66006700 km s@xmath3 is distributed along a fragmented ring around the galaxy n7319 , possibly formed after a tidal interaction with n7320c .",
    "such hi rings have previously been observed in other interacting systems like e.g. n5291 ( malphrus et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the northwestern side of the hi ring overlaps with the dwarf galaxy candidate identified as region 6 .",
    "it is possible that there are other tidal dwarf galaxy candidates along what would be the continuation of the ring , to the north , beyond region 6 , north of n7319 , where hi is not measured by williams et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "comparing the eastern side of the hi ring with an optical image of the quintet we notice that the end of the tidal tail of n7319 that points to n7320c ( in the southeastern side of the group ) has a number of optical condensations ( hunsberger et al .",
    "1996 , gallagher et al .",
    "2000 ) that overlaps with maxima in the hi distribution .",
    "these regions probably have similar velocities to that of the hi gas ( 6700 km s@xmath3 ) and are most likely tidal dwarf candidates formed during a past encounter between n7319 and n7320c .",
    "other faint condensations can be seen in this region , between n7319 and n7320c .",
    "the velocities of these objects have to be measured in order to confirm their nature .",
    "what is very intriguing at first is the exact superposition of the hi component at 6700 km s@xmath3 with the galaxy ngc 7320 , at 800 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this superposition may be understood if the following is considered .",
    "moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) noted that while in a narrow - band image ( e.g. h@xmath0 ) the galaxy ngc 7320 appeared symmetric , in a broad - band image it appeared very asymmetric , showing an extension to its northwest .",
    "in fact , what may appear to be the northwestern extension of the nearby galaxy n7320 in broad - band images may be in reality a chain of smaller background objects ( perhaps other tidal dwarf galaxy candidates ? ) superimposed on the line of sight , but with velocities that coincide with that of the hi component at 6700 km s@xmath3 .",
    "other regions may have velocities of @xmath6 5700 km s@xmath55 ( possibly associated with n7318b ) .",
    "support for this scenario comes from the mix of velocities measured in this region by moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . again",
    ", more velocity measurements of the condensations present in this region are needed .",
    "other tidal dwarf galaxies may be associated with n7318a .",
    "although moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) did not consider this galaxy in the interacting history of the quintet , it must have been part of collisions given the peculiar pattern of dust seen in the hst image ( charlton et al .",
    "2000 ) and due to the several linear features that seem to emanate from the galaxy .",
    "these were marked with arrows in fig .",
    "a few of these could be projected material from n7318a into the intragroup medium , in the same way it has been observed for arp 105 by duc ( 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively it could be material in the process of re - accretion onto the parent galaxy after an interaction .",
    "there seems to be two different types of linear features , a few that are long and filamentary , with very low surface brightnesses and others that are small and have high surface brightnesses .",
    "perhaps also region 6 may be born out of gas from n7318a and not of n7319 as it has been assumed throughout this paper .",
    "this would be a specially appealing scenario if we could confirm that there is material in between galaxy n7318a and region 6 at a common velocity ( of @xmath6 6700 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , it is more probable ( see fig . 2 of xu et al .",
    "1999 ) that the apparent optical connection between regions 8 and 4 ( seen as a filament in the hst image ) is at a lower velocity of 59006000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "also important would be to confirm if the features marked in fig .",
    "1c coincide with the velocity of n7318a .",
    "we would also like to point out that the emission detected in regions 7 and 9 and in the features in between these two regions might be associated with the higher velocity component of the group at 6700 km s@xmath3 instead of being related to the lower velocity component ( as it has been assumed in this paper ) .",
    "this is supported by the h@xmath0[nii ] map presented by xu et al .",
    "( 1999 , their fig .",
    "2 ) , which shows clearly that these regions are dominated by emission from the high - velocity component .",
    "further indirect evidence is their low h@xmath0 content despite their high optical luminosities ( see fig . 1a and 1c ) , which suggests that the emission from this area may perhaps fall at the very edge of the cfht filter , where the transmission is minimum .",
    "these regions would not have been detected in the lower s / n data taken with the sao 6 m , where only very bright sources like region 6 were detected . as can be seen from fig .",
    "1c the _ optical _ luminosities of the sources in the area in between regions 7 and 9 are comparable to those of other regions identified by us .",
    "this only illustrates the incredible mixture of matter at two different velocities in this group .",
    "we assumed in the previous sections that region 6 is formed of remnant gas from n7319 ( moles et al .",
    "we favored this scenario based on the evidence from the hi observations ( fig . 5 from williams et al .",
    "1999 ) which showed a structure similar to a ring ( an hi incomplete ring ) around galaxy n7319 .",
    "the hi gas associated with region 6 seems to be part of this large ring , in which case region 6 would be formed from gas originally in n7319 . on the other hand , there is also the possibility that region 6 was formed from gas spelled from n7318a .",
    "support for this is given by fig .",
    "1c , where linear features apparently associated with n7318a are seen . in this scenario region 6",
    "might be located at the tip of a tidal tail that may originate at the northern arm of n7318a .",
    "we need new velocity measurements of the region to decide between the two scenarios .    in the following",
    "we give the parameters for region 6 in the case where it is physically associated with n7318a : ( 1 ) it would be at a distance of 25 h@xmath7 kpc to the parent galaxy ; ( 2 ) it would have a tidal mass of 6 @xmath1 10@xmath56 m@xmath35 , smaller than its inferred mass ; ( 3 ) the difference between its radial velocity and that of the parent galaxy is still lower than the escape velocity of the parent galaxy ; ( 4 ) its inclination ( 60@xmath41 15 ) would still be similar to ( within the errors ) to that measured for the parent galaxy ( 49 , value taken from the lyon - meudon extragalactic database , leda ) .",
    "we presented b and r photometry and a fabry - perot h@xmath0 map of 23 emission - line regions in stephan s quintet .",
    "all but one region may be associated with n7318b ( region 6 may be attached either to n7319 or to n7318a ) .",
    "* we find that seven of the regions have velocity gradients greater than 8 h@xmath9 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 .",
    "we classify those as tidal dwarf galaxy candidates . *",
    "two tidal dwarf candidates may be located at the edge of a tidal tail , one within a tail and for four others there is no obvious stellar / gaseous bridge between them and the parent galaxy .",
    "* two of the candidates are associated with hi clouds , one of which is , in addition , associated with a co cloud . *",
    "the tidal dwarf candidates have low continuum fluxes and high h@xmath0 luminosity densities of f(h@xmath0 ) = 1  60 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , magnitudes of m@xmath5 16.1 to 12.6 , sizes of typically @xmath6 3.5 h@xmath7 kpc , colors @xmath25 between 0.3 and 1.3 , gas velocity gradients of @xmath6 8  26 h@xmath9 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 , sfr(h@xmath57)/sfr(@xmath58 ) between @xmath6 1100 and 6000 , masses of @xmath6 2 @xmath1 10@xmath10 to 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 and a median mass - to - light ratio of 7 m@xmath12/l@xmath12 . * the lower limits of the masses of the candidate tidal dwarf galaxies determined from their rotation curves ( assuming that they are pure rotators ) are in two cases larger than their tidal masses . *",
    "two out of the seven candidates may have velocities such that they can escape the gravitational field of the parent galaxy . * possible streaming motions within the tails",
    "may not have significantly affected the observed velocity gradients of those tidal dwarf candidates that are located within tails . * the dynamical criterion for formation of tidal tails during a collision v@xmath54/v@xmath43 @xmath16 2.5 is followed by galaxies ngc 7319 and ngc 7318b .",
