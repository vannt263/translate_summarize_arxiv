    "in light nuclei , some of negative - parity rotational bands with high @xmath10 quanta are discussed in relation with specific symmetry of intrinsic states .",
    "one of the famous examples is the @xmath11 state at @xmath12 mev in @xmath1c , which has been discussed for a long time in connection to an equilateral triangle configuration of @xmath6 cluster structure .",
    "the @xmath11 state is the lowest negative - parity state , and its spin is contradict to the naive expectation from shell model calculations .",
    "the reason for the low - lying @xmath11 state is understood by the point group @xmath13 symmetry of the equilateral triangle @xmath6 cluster structure  @xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : penta](a ) ] , which is characterized by the @xmath14-fold symmetry with @xmath15 of the intrinsic structure .",
    "the @xmath11 state is interpreted as the band head of the @xmath3 band constructed by the parity and total - angular - momentum projection from the @xmath13 symmetry of the intrinsic state .",
    "although the @xmath16 state in the @xmath3 band has not yet confirmed , a possible assignment @xmath16 for the level at @xmath17 mev was suggested  @xcite . in microscopic @xmath6 cluster models ,",
    "the @xmath3 band is considered to form a parity doublet with the @xmath4 ground band  @xcite .    in @xmath0si , the @xmath2 rotational band starting from the @xmath18 state at @xmath19 mev was reported in @xmath20-ray measurements by glatz et al .",

    "[ fig : penta](b ) ] .",
    "since a @xmath2 band can be constructed from the @xmath21 symmetry of the intrinsic state , the existing @xmath2 band might be an indirect evidence of the pentagon shape and may be regarded as the parity partner of the @xmath4 ground state .    in spite of the reasonable description of the @xmath2 band in @xmath0si with the @xmath5 cluster model ,",
    "the bb @xmath7-cluster model is too simple to quantitatively describe low - lying energy spectra of @xmath0si  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the validity of the ansatz that @xmath0si consists of seven @xmath7 clusters is not obvious but it should be checked with frameworks without any cluster assumptions because @xmath7 clusters might be dissociated or melted down due to the spin - orbit force in @xmath22-shell nuclei  @xcite .    recently , more sophisticated calculations of @xmath0si were performed by one of the authors with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd )  @xcite , which is a framework free from cluster assumptions .",
    "the calculations reproduce well low - lying positive - parity levels of the oblate ground band and the excited prolate band by incorporating the spin - orbit force with a proper strength .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath2 band is constructed from the oblate state with a pentagon shape even though existence of any clusters is not assumed in the calculations  @xcite .",
    "this means that the pentagon shape can be induced by @xmath7 cluster correlation in the oblate intrinsic state of @xmath0si .    from the viewpoint of the symmetry breaking , the pentagon shape in the intrinsic state",
    "is regarded as the spontaneous breaking of the axial symmetry .",
    "the surface density is oscillating along the edge of the oblate shape , that is , the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) occurs in the rotational invariance around the symmetric axis . in relation to the ssb concerning density ,",
    "this structure is associated with density wave ( dw ) in a nuclear matter , in which the ssb of the translational invariance occurs .",
    "the dw in nuclear matter has been discussed for a long time  @xcite , and it was suggested that the one - dimensional dw could be stable in a low density nuclear matter  @xcite . the nonuniform nuclear matter with density oscillation has also been investigated with cluster models as the @xmath7-cluster matter  @xcite . in analogy to the nuclear matter dw , the pentagon shape can be interpreted as the static one - dimensional dw at the edge of the oblate state .",
    "our aim is to give description of the pentagon and triangle shapes in terms of the dw with the wave number five and three to discuss the relation of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 cluster structures with the static edge dw , i.e. , the spontaneous axial symmetry breaking of the oblate states .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the amd calculations of @xmath0si while focusing on the pentagon shape in the oblate states . in analysis of single - particle wave functions of the obtained amd wave functions ,",
    "we show that the pentagon shape is expressed by one - particle and one - hole excitations having the wave number five on the oblate state and it can be interpreted as the one - dimensional dw . to see the instability of the axial symmetry with respect to the pentagon shape",
    ", analyses of ideal cluster models using bb wave functions are performed .",
    "similarly , focusing on the triangle shape of the @xmath6 cluster structure , structures of @xmath1c are also discussed .",
    "we introduce a simplified model for the one - dimensional dw in the oblate state by truncating active orbits for particle and hole states , and show that the proton - neutron coherent dws in @xmath8 nuclei promote the instability of the oblate states with respect to the pentagon and triangle shapes .",
    "the suppression mechanism of cluster structures in neutron - rich nuclei is discussed from the viewpoint of proton dw with excess neutrons .",
