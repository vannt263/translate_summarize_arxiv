    "more specifically , erds showed that a @xmath7 integer lattice determines @xmath8 distinct distances ( for more details , see section [ sec : structure ] ) . though almost 70 years have passed since erds considered this lattice structure , no configuration that determines an asymptotically smaller number of distinct distances",
    "was discovered .    for the celebrations of his 80th birthday , erds compiled a survey of his favorite contributions to mathematics @xcite , in which he wrote    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  my most striking contribution to geometry is , no doubt , my problem on the number of distinct distances .",

    "since the problem is almost completely solved , one might wonder what is the purpose of this document .",
    "the answer is that there are many challenging variants of the distinct distances problem that are still wide open ( many of those posed by erds ) .",
    "for some of these variants , such as the ones presented in section [ sec : structure ] , even after several decades of work hardly anything non - trivial is known .",

    "in this section we discuss characterizing the point sets that determine a small number of distinct distances .",
    "this seems to be the family of problems for which we know the least ; even after decades of studying them , hardly anything is known .",
    "we say that a set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points in the plane is _ optimal _ if @xmath17 . since the asymptotic value of @xmath5 is still unknown , we consider sets @xmath0 of @xmath1 points that satisfy @xmath18 , and refer to such sets as _ near - optimal_. all the point sets in this section are planar .",
    "erds asked whether every optimal ( or near - optimal ) set  has lattice structure \" @xcite . to make this question clearer , let us first consider some of the known near - optimal sets",
    ". in the introduction we already mentioned that the @xmath7 integer lattice ( e.g. , see figure [ fi : grids](a ) ) determines @xmath19 distinct distances .",
    "this was observed by erds , who noticed that this is an immediate corollary of the following theorem from number theory .",
    "[ th : landram ] * ( landau - ramanujan @xcite ) * the number of positive integers smaller than @xmath1 that are the sum of two squares is @xmath8 .",
    "every distance in the @xmath7 integer lattice is the square root of a sum of two squares between 0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , theorem [ th : landram ] implies that the number of distinct distances in this case is @xmath8 .",
    "the above implies that the @xmath7 integer lattice is a near - optimal set .",
    "more generally , for any integer @xmath20 , every @xmath1 point subset of the @xmath21 integer lattice is a near - optimal set ( since we can still apply theorem [ th : landram ] in such cases ) , and so are translations , rotations , and uniform scalings of such lattices . for example , the lattice in figure [ fi : grids](b ) can be obtained either by rotating and scaling the @xmath7 integer lattice , or by removing from the @xmath22 integer lattice every point whose coordinates sum to an odd number .",
    "we can further generalize the above .",
    "for any integer @xmath23 , we define the rectangular lattice @xmath24 the points of any such @xmath25 span @xmath8 distinct distances ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . by applying various transformations to these rectangular lattices ,",
    "we get more near - optimal lattices . for example , the triangular lattice , which corresponds to the vertices in a tiling of equilateral triangles ( e.g. , see figure [ fi : grids](c ) ) , can be obtained by taking a rectangular lattice and removing every other vertex . after obtaining optimal sets for a few small values of @xmath1 , erds and",
    "fishburn @xcite conjectured that , for infinitely many values of @xmath1 , there is an @xmath1-point subset of the triangular lattice that is optimal ( that is , not just near - optimal ) .    for",
    "now , hardly anything is known regarding erds s conjecture that every near - optimal set has a lattice structure . as a first step",
    ", erds @xcite suggested to determine whether every near - optimal point set contains @xmath26 points on a line , and thus most of the set can be covered by a small number of lines .",
    "since this also appears to be quite difficult , erds asked whether there exists a line with @xmath27 points of the set .",
    "embarrassingly , even this weaker variant remains open .",
    "[ pr : online ] * ( erds @xcite ) * prove or disprove : for a sufficiently small @xmath28 , every near - optimal point set contains @xmath27 points on a common line .",
    "the current best bound is that for every near - optimal set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points , there exists a line @xmath29 such that @xmath30 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "a recent result @xcite states that for every near - optimal set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points and @xmath31 , either there exists a line or a circle that contains @xmath32 points of @xmath0 , or there exist @xmath33 distinct lines that contain @xmath34 points of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , one way to solve problem [ pr : online ] might be to prove that for any point set @xmath0 with many lines that contain @xmath34 points of @xmath0 ( and @xmath0 being near optimal ) , there exists a line containing @xmath35 points of @xmath0 .",
    "sheffer , zahl , and de zeeuw @xcite considered the complement problem  proving that no line can contain many points of a near - optimal set .",
    "specifically , they proved that for every near - optimal set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points , every line contains @xmath36 points of @xmath0 .",
