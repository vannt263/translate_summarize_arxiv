    "one of the most fundamental problem in dealing with conscious experiences and consciousness is the following : if i am able to completely describe the physical state of my brain ( conceding that all the physics necessary to such description is already known ) , may i safely say to have completely described my mental state , my subjective experience too ?",
    "the point is that my subjective experiences , like for example those of pain , joy or smell ( generally referred to as _ qualia _ ) , seem not to get exhausted in a physical - functional description of my cerebral states , even in the most complete description we are able to imagine to .",
    "actually , the description of the physical processes which take place in my brain , when i experience pain for example , seems not to be a complete description of my subjective experience of pain ; at most , it seems to be only a complete description of the cerebral states of my brain _ during _ my pain experience .    in other words",
    ", it seems that a barrier , impassable to every physical theory , forbids any complete objective description of subjective experience , or , at least , every complete objective description of a subjective experience simply does not include the subjective experience itself .",
    "the objective description and the subjective experience seem to belong to different and ` orthogonal ' dimensions , the _ outside _ and the _",
    "inside_.    what i have described above briefly summarizes the well - known _ mind - body problem _ , the main ingredient of the philosophical investigations of the mind and a thorn in the side of physicalism , namely of those who believe in a complete reduction of consciousness to peculiar physical processes of the brain ( for accessible and exhaustive reviews of the mind - body problem see , for example , nagel  @xcite and chalmers  @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper i provide an equivalent formulation of the mind  body problem , which i will call the ` brain duplication ' argument , and i will show that if we assume that consciousness is in any case a physical process which takes place in the physical world , in the most general sense of these terms , namely that it does not transcend physical reality , then the human brain , in giving rise to the mind , might be characterized by the astonishing property of an extensive interdependence with the _ whole _ surrounding physical world .",
    "for the sake of thought experiment , let us suppose that we manage to create an exact , physically identical duplicate of my brain , as it is in this precise moment .",
    "actually , it does not matter whether we do not known operatively how to do it .",
    "the point is that since at least a brain exists physically , then nothing forbids us to imagine an identical physical duplicate of it , as well as nothing forbids us to imagine an identical physical duplicate , atom by atom , of the sheet of paper on which these words are written , just for the fact that such sheet of paper exists , even if probably we will never be able to do the actual duplicate .",
    "now , just after the creation of this duplicate , how would my own consciousness react ?",
    "as everyone of you can experience directly , one of the leading characteristics of consciousness is the perception of its own uniqueness , the uniqueness of oneself and of its own conscious experience , and , in addition , the perception of the persistence of such uniqueness ( i feel to be myself also in different periods and different places ) .",
    "therefore , if i were able to exactly duplicate my brain , would my own consciousness change ? and",
    "if it changes , how does it change ?",
    "would i feel to be here , where i was before the duplication , but at the same time would i feel to be there , where my brain duplicate is now ?",
    "i believe that the most natural answer for everyone is that i will continue to be myself as i was before the duplication .",
    "but then , _ who _ or _ what _ is my exact physical duplicate ? if the two brains are physically identical and their consciousnesses are different , in what do they differ ? here two possible approaches to the problem are presented .",
    "consciousness is not physically reproducible in the reality .",
    "namely it does not depend on physical reality and it is in some sense ` outside ' it : thus , distinct conscious experiences and consciousnesses may even be attached to two physically identical brains , or only one of these brains may be conscious ( and the other one may not ; the duplicate brain , for example , might be a so - called _ zombie _ ) .",
    "if it is so , there is not much to do ; as a matter of fact , consciousness would constitute a _ prime _ and _ alien _ property , to be added to the rest of the physical properties of the brain .",
    "however , such hypothesis seems to be scientifically frustrating and , after all , not particularly reasonable .",
    "i guess that not many researchers would honestly feel up to deny any link between consciousness and the physical world ( even if such link is not completely clear from a scientific point of view ) .",
    "even if we assume that the existence of the brain is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the presence of consciousness , the latter must necessarily have a physical interaction with the brain , otherwise it would not even make sense to talk about brain as necessary condition , without speaking about the substantial amount of data achieved nowadays in the neurosciences on the _ neural correlates _ of consciousness . moreover , matter can act on mind and consciousness , as any physical and chemical interferences on our state of consciousness can easily demonstrate .",
    "so , matter , mind and consciousness have to speak the same ` language ' . and",
    "therefore consciousness must be a physically characterizable , a physically tractable entity",
    ".    such physical entity might be completely internal or external ( partially or totally ) to the brain . in the first case we just would have that the exact physical reproduction of one s brain would give _ tout court _ the consciousness of that person ( and hence , the brain duplication dilemma ) .",
    "if , on the contrary , this entity were external , it might be one and unique , or there might be many , one of them corresponding to each consciousness currently existing in the world . yet",
    ", this further distinction is not important in our case : plausibly , two physically identical brains would always interact in the same way with the same external physical agent ( like two equally tuned radio receivers ` interact ' always with the same radio station , although there are a lot of different radio frequencies in the air ) , and again the brain duplication dilemma would be left untouched",
    ". however , i believe that now this dilemma is ready to be tackled with the possible physical explanation described in the next section .",
    "let us suppose instead that consciousness depends on physical reality , namely on the peculiar organization of physical matter and energy , in the most general sense of these terms , and also let us do not exclude the possibility , suggested in the previous section , that consciousness originates not only in the physics of the brain but also through the interaction with an external physical process .",
    "a possible explanation of the seemingly paradoxical picture originated in the brain duplication argument is that ( the evolution of ) the cerebral processes involved in the rise of consciousness might physically depend not only on the physics of the brain itself but actually also on _ all _ the things which physically surround such brain , in the sense that it depends on the organization of _ all _ the surrounding physical matter and energy .    in such framework",
    ", the physically exact copy of my brain , which is in the region of the space @xmath0 , interacts with all the surrounding physical world , and thus also with my original brain which is in the region of space @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , my own original brain , which is in the region of space @xmath1 , interacts with all the surrounding physical world , and thus also with the physically exact copy of my brain , which is in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is clear ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) that the _ boundary conditions _ for the two identical brains _ are not identical _ , and the evolution of cerebral states , as well as consciousness , might not be identical ( although the memory of all the past experiences might be the same in every details for both brains ) . a similar conclusion on the possibility of an extensive physical interdependence of the human brain with the whole surrounding physical world in giving rise to mind has been drawn in another thought experiment ( dabramo  @xcite ) but through a different approach involving the notion of algorithmic complexity .",
    "note that any finite version of this approach , i.e.  that the suggested physical dependence is only on a finite portion of the surrounding physical world , does not change much the point . as a matter of fact",
    ", the brain+`finite portion of physical world ' must be a physically isolated system , i.e.  a totally isolated system . for",
    "if it were not , two such systems within two different environments would eventually lead to the same dilemma on consciousness as before , since the same consciousness will eventually experience different environments at the same time . hence , even in any finite approach , the finite portion of the surrounding physical world is in fact _ all _ the surrounding physical world .",
    "now , whether there are spatial limits to be understood in the word `` _ all _ '' used before , and whether they are posed by the concept of _ visible universe _ and finite speed of light , the discussion of this is beyond the scope of the present note .",
    "thus , the brain might be far from being a semi - closed box , opened only to the five senses , and the common perception that our brain does not continuously interact at a deeper physical level with the rest of the physical world might be simply wrong . as a loose analogy ,",
    "if the physical reality were the water of a sea , our brain would not be like a submarine guided by sonar , rather it would be more like a soaked sponge .",
    "so far , we have never made mention to _ how _ consciousness rises , or to _ which _ are the specific physical ` mechanisms ' at the basis of consciousness , but this was not the topic of our paper , other than being a very complicated and long - standing issue ( irresolvable at the moment , i think ) .",
    "rather , i have proposed a possible physical characterization of consciousness and mind : the uniqueness of conscious experience and consciousness might depend also on the _ whole _ surrounding physical world , in the sense of the organization of its physical matter and energy .",
    "but , if this were the case , it would be very strange if the rise itself of consciousness and mind did not depend on the extensive interaction of the brain with _ whole _ surrounding physical world .    by the way",
    ", if we do not accept the picture of the extensive physical interaction between brain and the whole surrounding physical world , but want to maintain the dependence of mind and consciousness on physical reality , and thus that mind and consciousness completely arise from the physical organization of the brain alone , all this would inevitably result in another type of ` extensive interdependence ' , a sort of non - locality : as a matter of fact , after the brain duplication , the very same mind ( the very same person ) could be in two very distant places at the same time .",
    "i believe that talking about the necessary physical mechanisms responsible for the suggested extensive interaction , and actually talking about the detailed physical dynamics and evolution of such interaction , is premature at the moment .",
    "it might be said ( and it was actually said already ) that the human brain may be assimilated to a complex dynamical system , extremely sensitive to all the surrounding physical conditions ( in such case we should mention the so - called _ deterministic chaos _ ; see for example newman  @xcite ) , or that quantum mechanics may be deeply involved ( many people have proposed various quantum mechanisms to explain consciousness , so to compile a complete list of references on this topic is hopeless ; see for example bohm  @xcite and references therein ) , or , most probably , that a new kind of physics is needed .",
    "however , although such aspect of the problem is obviously essential in the study of the origin of consciousness , it is secondary in the present context .",
    "i wish to thank alessandro silvestrini for having brought to my attention the ` brain duplication ' argument , during a conversation around a coffee table . by the way , the name of the caf was ` mir ' , thus for the sake of joke , i suggest to call the argument of this paper ` the mir hypothesis ' .",
    "i am also grateful to william a.  adams for insightful comments on this paper .",
    "i wish to thank herbert f.  muller for having posted a previous version of this paper on the karl jaspers forum website .",
