    "ultrathin ferromagnetic films grown on nonmagnetic substrate show peculiar magnetic behavior @xcite .",
    "one of the unique phenomena which is observed in the ultrathin ni films on cu(001 ) substrate is the spin direction reorientation transition ( srt ) from an in - plane to out - of - plane magnetization direction when the ni - overlayer thickness is increased @xcite .",
    "it is very important for the spintronic magnetic device applications and its microscopic understanding attracted recently both experimental and theoretical @xcite interest .",
    "the gas adsorption on magnetic film provides the way to monitor the surface magnetic properties resulting in strong influence on the srt critical thickness @xmath0 . for ni / cu(001 ) films",
    ", the hydrogen adsorption is observed to reduce @xmath0 by @xmath1 4 monolayers ( ml ) from its value of @xmath1 11 ml for the vacuum / ni / cu - films @xcite .    the key quantity which drives the srt in ultrathin magnetic films is the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) .",
    "it determines the preferred film magnetization orientation by minimizing the free energy of the system . for the free - standing ni / cu(001 )",
    "films , the @xmath0 is found to be determined @xcite by competition of the uniaxial mae due to the tetragonal distortion of ni - films ( so called  volume \" mae ) and the surface mae .",
    "the adsorption of a gas produces non - trivial changes in geometrical structure as well as magnetic properties of ni films @xcite influencing both volume and surface mae , and results in change of the srt critical thickness .    in recent years",
    "it has become possible to make use of _ ab initio _ density functional theory to predict the mae in ultra - thin films @xcite . from theoretical and computational point of view , the mae calculations are extremely difficult due to the very high energy resolution in the range of few @xmath2ev which is required . for the h",
    "/ ni / cu(001 ) films , the problem becomes even more complex due to the need of accurate account of structural relaxation .",
    "it requires us to use the most accurate total energy full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( fp - lapw ) @xcite in order to account simultaneously on equilibrium geometrical and magnetic structures .",
    "the experiments show that h@xmath3 adsorbs dissociatively on ni(001 ) surface in fourfold hollow sites @xcite . therefore , as a structural model for _ ab - initio _ calculations we use free - standing ni - films ( h / ni@xmath4/h , @xmath5 = 1 - 11 ) and ni - films on cu - substrate ( h / ni@xmath4/cu@xmath6/ni@xmath4/h , @xmath5 = 16 ) with ordered @xmath7h adsorbate overlayer as shown in fig . 1 .    the in - plane experimental lattice constant of cu @xmath8   @xcite is used which remains unchanged in the calculations .",
    "all interlayer spacings @xmath9 ( see fig . 1 ) are relaxed to the equilibrium values . in order to determine the equilibrium slab geometry we employ the fp - lapw method in flair implementation ( unpublished improved and rewritten version of the original flapw codes @xcite ) .",
    "the scalar - relativistic atomic force technique is employed for the total energy minimization . here",
    ", the perdew and wang @xcite approximation for exchange - correlation potential is used with the plane wave energy cutoff @xmath10 of 13 ry , and the 28 special k - points in the 1/8th irreducible part of 2-dimensional brillouin zone ( 2d bz ) are used for the bz integrations .",
    "the convergence better than 1 @xmath11 10@xmath12 e/(a.u.)@xmath13 is achieved for charge / spin densities , and better than 0.2 mry / a.u . for the atomic force acting on individual atom .",
    "the relaxed interlayer distances for different free - standing films ( h / ni@xmath14/cu@xmath6/ni@xmath14/h , @xmath15 = 36 ) are shown in fig . 2 and compared with the relaxation of tetragonal @xmath7h ni(100 ) surface .",
    "clearly , we can distinguish the outward relaxation of top ni layer as well as the strong influence of ni / cu interface on inter - layer distances in the close vicinity of the interface .",
    "the relaxation of ni / cu subsurface is different only for 5 ml ni .",
    "the deeper interlayer distances ( thicker film ) approach the bulk value .       the layer - resolved spin magnetic moments",
    "@xmath16 for these systems are shown in table 2 .",
    "these values correspond to the magnetic moments in the ni  muffin - tin \" spheres ( @xmath17  a.u . ) .",
    "it is seen that there is strong reduction of the spin magnetization for the top ni - layer due to the interaction with the h - adlayer .",
    "the strong hybridization of the h _ s _ state with the filled majority ni _",
    "band changes the band structure and the surface density of states ( sdos ) leading to the decrease of spin - majority and increase of the spin - minority sdos .",
    "away from the interface , the spin magnetic moments are slowly converging to their bulk values . the layer - resolved magnetic moments for different h / ni@xmath14/cu@xmath6-films ( @xmath15 = 36 ) on cu - substrate are shown in fig .",
    "we note that for very thin h / ni@xmath14/cu@xmath6-films with n=1,2 the ni - local moments disappear and the system becomes non - magnetic . with the increase of the ni - film thickness",
    ", the local ni @xmath16 of 0.24 @xmath18 is formed at the ni - interface and then increases away from the h / ni interface . when approaching the ni / cu interface , the ni - atom magnetic moments start to decrease again and become @xmath1 for ni / cu interface layer ( depending of the ni - film thickness ) .",
    "where , @xmath20 terms are 2nd and 4th - order volume - type anisotropy constants , @xmath21 terms are surface / interface - type 2nd and 4th - order anisotropy constants , @xmath22 are magnetization cosines with respect to the crystal axes , and @xmath5 is a thickness of magnetic film .",
    "we assume that the 4th - order terms in eq.(1 ) are significantly smaller than 2nd - order uniaxial anisotropy constant @xmath23 , and neglect them .",
    "the mae then can be characterized with the difference in the total energy when magnetization is oriented along [ 100 ] ( in - plane , @xmath24 ) and [ 001 ] ( out - of - plane , @xmath25 ) axes ( mae = @xmath26 \\ ; - \\ ; e[001]$ ] ) .",
    "we use the relativistic version @xcite of the fp - lapw method to solve self - consistently the kohn - sham - dirac equations with spin - orbit coupling included to obtain the ground state charge and spin densities for the magnetization directed along [ 001]-axis .",
    "the fully optimized interlayer distances as discussed above are used for free - standing ni - films and ni - films on cu - substrate with h - adlayer .",
    "the mae is obtained by applying the force theorem to the spin - axis rotation @xcite : from the self - consistent ground state charge and spin density obtained for the [ 001 ] spin axis , a calculation of the band structure for [ 100 ] spin axis orientation is performed , and difference of the single particle eigenvalue sums is then taken to be the mae . for the mae calculations the k - points mesh equivalent to 6400 k - points in the full 2d bz is used guaranteeing the mae convergence better than 10 @xmath27ev .",
    "the mae as a function of the ni - film thickness for the h / ni@xmath4/h films with @xmath5 = 3,5,7,9 ml is shown in fig .",
    "4 . for the @xmath28 we found small and negative mae keeping the ni - film magnetization in [ 100 ] plane . it becomes positive for the @xmath29 ( 0.432 mev ) resulting in the out - of - plane magnetization switching .",
    "the mae is positive with further increase of @xmath5 and shows pronounced oscillations .",
    "the linear interpolation mae = @xmath30 yields the estimates for the  volume \" @xmath31= 0.106 mev / atom and  interface \" @xmath32=-0.127 mev / atom mae contributions .",
    "the calculated  volume \" mae agrees well with @xmath31= 0.0835 mev / atom calculated for free - standing unrelaxed ni - films without h - adlayer @xcite and extrapolated to t=0 k experimental value of 0.072 mev / atom of ref .",
    "the h / ni  interface \" @xmath32 is calculated to be substantially smaller than vacuum / ni  surface \" @xmath33 = -0.447 mev / atom @xcite for free - standing ni - films and extrapolated to t=0 k experimental value of -0.7 mev / atom @xcite .",
    "we note that for the very thin ni - films considered here , validity of the linear fit for the mae and its separation into  volume \" and  surface \" contributions is _ not well justified _ due to the strong dependence of the ni - film magnetic properties on the thickness of the film , especially in the presence of the h - adlayer .    in order to estimate the @xmath0 critical thickness for srt",
    ", we take into account the shape anisotropy energy ( sae ) due to the magnetic dipole interaction , which provides additional in - plane anisotropy .",
    "this anisotropy is estimated using the relation sae = @xmath34 to the spin magnetization density m ( in cgs units ) .",
    "it yields for the sae the values of -0.016 mev , -0.032 mev , -0.055 mev and -0.073 mev corresponding respectively to the h / ni@xmath4/h films with @xmath5 = 3,5,7,9 layers ( which are consistent with experimentally derived sae / ni atom of -0.0075 mev @xcite ) .",
    "this additional negative sae slightly shifts the mae in fig .",
    "4 downwards yielding the @xmath0 = 4 .    indeed",
    ", the h / ni@xmath4/h model is a way too simple to describe quantitatively the srt in in ni / cu layers with h - adlayer . as it was already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite the ni / cu interface can play an important role . in order to evaluate the influence of ni / cu interface on srt",
    "we perform the calculations for h / ni@xmath4/cu@xmath35/ni@xmath4/h ( @xmath5 = 3,4 ) films , where the 5 cu layers play a role of the substrate .",
    "the use of 5 ml of cu layers instead of 7 ml allows to reduce computational effort without producing any significant impact on the magnetic properties and the mae of h / ni / cu - films , since they are originated from ni magnetic film and not the cu non - magnetic substrate , and the relaxed cu - interlayer distance below the ni - interface is found to be very close to its bulk value of 3.427 a.u .",
    "for the @xmath28 we found negative mae of -0.192 mev and sae of -0.036 mev keeping the ni - film magnetization in [ 100 ] plane .",
    "already for @xmath36 the mae becomes positive 0.543 mev while the sae is small and negative -0.052 mev .",
    "again as in the case of free - standing h / ni@xmath4/h films we get the srt critical thickness @xmath37 .",
    "to summarize , we found that hydrogen adsorption for the ni films on cu substrate yields the reduction of the srt critical thickness .",
    "the calculated @xmath37 for both h / ni@xmath4/h and h / ni@xmath4/cu@xmath35/ni@xmath4/h films agrees well with the experimental @xmath0 of 7 ml @xcite .",
    "we show that the mae has strong and oscillatory dependence on the ni - film thickness which deviates substantially from the linear fit .",
    "we attribute the decrease of the @xmath0 due to the h adsorption to originate from strong reduction of the magnitude for the ni  surface \" mae contribution . in turn",
    ", this is caused by strong decrease of the exchange splitting at the h / ni interface due to the strong hybridization of the h @xmath38 state with the ni - bands .",
