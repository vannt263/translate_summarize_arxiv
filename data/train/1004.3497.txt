    "many physical properties of continuous media at low temperatures can be described in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "the dispersion relation of superfluid helium is non - monotonic and the quasiparticles that correspond to different monotonic regions of the dispersion curve are called phonons , @xmath0 rotons , and @xmath1 rotons ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 rotons have negative group velocity , i.e. their momentum is directed opposite to their group velocity . the phonons and rotons",
    "are observed in many experiments , such as in neutron scattering in helium @xcite and in the direct experiments @xcite , where beams of superfluid helium quasiparticles are created by a heated solid .",
    "the quasiparticles propagate in the helium , interact and reflect from different surfaces and quantum evaporate helium atoms from the free surface .",
    "these processes have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath0 rotons were not detected in direct experiments until 1999 , when they were finally created by a specially constructed source @xcite and observed by quantum evaporation .",
    "all the earlier attempts to create @xmath0 , with ordinary solid heaters and bolometers , were unsuccessful .",
    "he  ii quasiparticles interact with the interface and can cause their transmission , reflection , and conversion into each other ( i.e. mode change ) .",
    "these are the fundamental elementary processes that determine heat exchange between he  ii and a solid , and cause phenomena such as the kapitza temperature jump at a solid - liquid helium interface .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "the phonons are long wavelength fluctuations of density , with the same nature as longitudinal phonons in a solid , and in the long wavelength limit , the problem of their interaction with an interface with a solid , is reduced to the problem of transmission of waves with some constant frequency through this interface .",
    "this problem can be found in textbooks on acoustics .",
    "the theory can be generalized to take into account the structure of real solids @xcite and the structure of the real interfaces ( see @xcite ) .    for short - wave excitations , rotons , there are still various models and views regarding their nature ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , and the problem of their interaction with the interface is of significant interest .",
    "the first work in this direction was @xcite .",
    "however , the method used there did not take into account the possibility of simultaneous creation of phonons and @xmath1 and @xmath0 rotons on the interface , and it could not distinguish between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 rotons .    in the current work we consider the problem of the interaction of superfluid helium quasiparticles with interfaces in a consistent and unified way .",
    "we use the approach that describes a quantum fluid as a continuous medium at the length scales that include the average interatomic distance , in terms of dispersive hydrodynamics ( see ) .",
    "this was developed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "such an approach is feasible because in a quantum fluid the atoms are delocalised , as the thermal de broglie wavelength is much larger than @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the atom number density in the liquid .",
    "the idea to describe superfluid helium as a continuous medium at microscopic scales has been successfully used for decades .",
    "atkins @xcite used it in the 1950s to describe the mobility of electrons and ions in he  ii . in ref .",
    "@xcite , nonlocal hydrodynamics was introduced to describe small oscillations in superfluid helium , and in it was used to describe ripplon - roton hybridization . the density functional approach",
    "( see for example @xcite ) also utilizes this idea .",
    "however , the theoretical justification of this approach remained on the intuitive level until the work @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality in the theory allows one to describe a medium with an arbitrary nonlinear dispersion relation @xmath4 , which appears explicitly in its equations and is the only input `` parameter '' in the theory .",
    "the possibility of using nonlocal hydrodynamics to describe a medium with an arbitrary dispersion relation is discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "both phonons and rotons are considered as purely longitudinal excitations of the same nature , only with different wavelengths .",
    "the quasiparticles are described as wave packets in a continuous medium which has nonlocal bonds and nonlinear dispersion .",
    "the problem of their reflection or transmission through the interface is reduced to the problem of the interaction of the eigenmodes of the equations of the continuous medium with the interface .    as an intermediate step to solving the problem for all the quasiparticles of superfluid helium",
    ", we considered different special cases of @xmath4 .",
    "first , the monotonic dispersion relation @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , was analyzed in one - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite cases . in these references , the solutions of the nonlocal equations of dispersive hydrodynamics in the half - space were obtained , and different effects of nonlinearity of @xmath4 on the problem of waves transmission through the interface were distinguished .    then in @xcite the dispersion relation such that @xmath7 is a cubic polynomial of @xmath8 was considered .",
    "it is the simplest expression that can approximate the distinctive dispersion relation of superfluid helium , in both the phonon and roton regions .",
    "the problem of the simultaneous creation of phonons and rotons on the interface was solved and the interaction of all he ii quasiparticles with the interface was described in a unified way .",
    "the failures of attempts to detect @xmath0 rotons , before the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , were explained , and predictions were made for new experiments on the interaction of phonons and rotons with a solid .",
    "however , the use of a simple cubic approximation for the dispersion relation of superfluid helium restricted the results obtained in @xcite to qualitative or semi - quantitative .    in the current work we present the consistent solution of the problem of the interaction of quasiparticles with an interface for the case when their dispersion relation is arbitrary and non - monotonic , so that @xmath7 is a polynomial of arbitrarily large degree @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of the creation of each quasiparticle at the interface is derived for all cases .",
    "this work includes and generalizes the results of works @xcite-@xcite , and in the special cases discussed previously , the expressions obtained here transform into the ones obtained earlier .",
    "so all results are now presented in a unified way .",
    "the exact expressions for the quasiparticles creation probabilities on the interface are derived analytically .",
    "those expressions are valid for all energies and angles of incidence of the quasiparticles that are incident on the interface .",
    "they are also valid for monotonic and non - monotonic dispersion relation , and for interfaces with a solid or for the free surface .",
    "all the qualitative results of @xcite with regard to superfluid helium , including the explanation why @xmath0 rotons were not detected in direct experiments until @xcite , are confirmed .",
    "the dispersion relation of surface excitations of he  ii , ripplons , can also be investigated in the same framework , but is not considered in this work , and is the subject of another investigation @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we consider the equations of the quantum fluid in a half - space and the boundary conditions that apply on the interface .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the solution of the equations , and in section 4 we discuss some general consequences of the solution s structure and of the use of boundary conditions with regard to the problem of waves interacting with interfaces .",
    "those include a generalization of snell s law and a realization of backward reflection and refraction for @xmath0 rotons .    in section 5",
    "we consider the process of a phonon in the solid which is incident on the interface , and derive the reflection and transmission coefficients . in the next section",
    "we calculate the partial transmission coefficients for the waves created in quantum fluid ( for the case when there are more than one ) , which are the creation probabilities of the corresponding quasiparticles created in the process . in section 7",
    "we derive all the creation probabilities in the process of a quasiparticle of the quantum fluid incident on the interface , i.e. phonon or @xmath0 roton or @xmath1 roton for the dispersion of superfluid helium .",
    "we discuss the peculiarities of the coefficients frequency and angular dependencies and refine the curves , obtained in @xcite for the coefficients calculated in a rough approximation .",
    "let us consider the half - space @xmath10 filled by a quantum fluid with equilibrium density @xmath11 and dispersion relation @xmath4 . according to the approach of @xcite",
    ", we introduce the variables of continuous medium : the velocity @xmath12 , and the deviations of pressure @xmath13 and density @xmath14 from their respective equilibrium values .",
    "these quantities must obey the laws of mass and momentum conservation ; therefore the excitations of small amplitude are described by ordinary linearised equations of an ideal liquid , but the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath13 is non - local , defined by some difference kernel @xmath15 . the problem in terms of pressure @xmath13 can be expressed as a nonlocal wave equation . when solving the problem in the half - space , the integration domain is limited to this half - space @xcite and the problem",
    "can be brought to the form @xmath16 where the dots denote derivatives with respect to time .",
    "we assume that the interface is sharp enough to consider that the kernel @xmath17 is the same in the presence of the interface as it is in the bulk medium .    in the infinite medium , the integration and definition domains of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) are infinite , its right - hand part is a convolution , and the kernel is related to the dispersion relation of the bulk excitations @xmath4 through its fourier transform ( see @xcite ) @xmath18    thus the equation ( [ eqp ] ) describes a continuous medium with dispersion relation @xmath4 , which fills the half - space @xmath10 .",
    "we do not try to find @xmath4 from microscopics , but rather use the experimentally measured curve as the `` input parameter '' of the theory and thus determine the kernel @xmath17 .",
    "this approach implicitly contains the inner structure of the fluid .",
    "the dispersion @xmath4 can be arbitrary .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the case , when it approximates to the distinctive dispersion relation of superfluid helium ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .    the equation ( [ eqp ] ) is supplemented by the boundary conditions on the interface @xmath19 .",
    "as the local equations of continuous medium hold on both sides of the interface , the boundary conditions , also local , are obtained from their integral forms in the usual way , using the theory of a continuous medium .",
    "if we consider the interface with a solid , the boundary conditions will have the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-component of the velocity of the continuous medium .",
    "if we consider the free surface of superfluid helium , with surface tension @xmath23 , then the pressure at the surface should be the laplace pressure , and for small deviations of the surface from equilibrium position can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath22-coordinate of the points of the surface ( see for example or ) .",
    "the real interface between helium and a solid or helium and vacuum is , of course , not infinitely sharp ; for quasiparticles , the interface can only approximately be considered flat since their wave - length may be comparable with the size of the microstructure of the solid surface .",
    "this especially concerns rotons , as their wave - length is comparable with the interatomic distances .",
    "the possible effects of taking this into account are discussed at the end of section 7 .",
    "the equation ( [ eqp ] ) was solved with the help of the wiener and hopf method in @xcite in the one - dimensional case , for the situation when the function @xmath7 is an arbitrary but monotonic polynomial at @xmath26 ; then generalized in @xcite to three dimensions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the case of nonmonotonic @xmath27 of degree @xmath28 was analyzed in detail .",
    "the nonmonotonic cubic polynomial is the simplest function that can approximate the distinctive dispersion relation of superfluid helium .",
    "therefore the use of this approximation allowed the authors in @xcite to solve the problem of superfluid helium phonons and rotons interaction with an interface , and in particular to derive the reflection and transmission coefficients for them in terms of roots of the corresponding cubic equation .",
    "however , due to the simplicity of the approximation , the results obtained were limited to semi - quantitative , especially for energies close to and higher than maxon the energy range below energies where the third degree polynomial starts to deviate from the @xmath1 roton part of helium spectrum significantly ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .    in the current work we use the solution of ( [ eqp ] ) for @xmath27 a polynomial of arbitrary power .",
    "the physical consequences of @xmath4 being essentially nonlinear were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "those include the presence in the solution of exponentially damped waves that correspond to complex roots of equation @xmath29 with regard to @xmath30 ; complex amplitude coefficients of transmission and reflection , the frequency dependencies of the coefficients , the angles of transmission and angles of full internal reflection .",
    "the consequences of non - monotonicity of @xmath4 were studied in detail in @xcite and these include , among others , multiple critical angles and backward reflection for @xmath0 rotons .",
    "now we have accumulated enough understanding of the problem to show what happens in the general case .",
    "the wiener and hopf method ( see for example @xcite , ) can be used to solve the eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) for the function @xmath4 of rather general form .",
    "its idea is to transform to new functions , to turn the right - hand part of ( [ eqp ] ) into a convolution and after the fourier transform by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , to reduce the problem to the homogeneous riemann boundary value problem ( see for example @xcite ) in the plane of complex variable @xmath33 ( see appendix for more detail ) .",
    "the problem is completely determined by its  density \" @xmath34 where @xmath35 is frequency , @xmath36 is the wave vector and @xmath37 its projection on the plane @xmath38 .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem is standard when @xmath39 is differentiable and does not become zero on the real axis of variable @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "however it can be generalised for our case when it has zeros in the real roots of equation @xmath41 with regard to @xmath33 , and is always zero when @xmath42 ( see appendix ) .    the simplest way to bypass",
    "the first limitation is to shift the real roots into the complex plane , while preserving the index of density @xmath39 .",
    "the index of @xmath39 is the key parameter of the riemann boundary problem , which can be calculated as the difference between the number of plain zeros of eq .",

    "@xmath45 is an even function and the index is zero",
    ". different ways of shifting the roots lead to different boundary problems ( more details below ) .",
    "the general solution is rather complicated . in order to make the inverse fourier transforms and",

    "each of the roots @xmath57 in the upper half - plane of @xmath33 gives a summand in ( [ solutionr ] ) and ( [ solutionr - v ] ) , so the solution @xmath54 in the quantum fluid will contain @xmath84 traveling waves and @xmath87 damped waves . in terms of the problem of quasiparticles interaction with the interface , as will be shown below in more detail , this leads to the following : when any quasiparticle is incident , all the quasiparticles that can be created on the interface , which conserve energy and tangential component of momentum , will be created with corresponding non - zero probabilities .",
    "in the next sections we consider the problem of quasiparticles interaction with the interface ,  their reflection , transmission and mode change . we treat quasiparticles as wave packets , so , as the problem is linear , it is reduced to the problem of plane waves interaction with the interface .",
    "however , when calculating energy transmission coefficients , we have to take into account that energy ( as any other quantity quadratic on amplitude ) is carried in a wave packet with its group velocity .    the solutions both in @xmath10 and @xmath88 consist of waves with given @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore in order for the boundary conditions to be satisfied for all @xmath32 in all the points of the interface @xmath38 , the frequencies @xmath35 and tangential components of wave vectors @xmath37 on both sides of the interface must be equal . in terms of quasiparticles",
    "this means that energy and the tangential component of momentum are conserved in the processes of quasiparticle destruction and creation at the interface .",
    "this leads to several general consequences .",
    "* the wave vectors of all the incident , transmitted and reflected waves lie in one plane , which we may denote by @xmath89 , and thus the problem is reduced to two - dimensional .",
    "the same consideration applies to the case of the free surface .",
    "* @xmath0 rotons have negative group velocity @xmath90 , or `` negative dispersion '' , i.e. their group and phase velocities are antiparallel .",
    "therefore for them the effects of backward reflection and refraction are realized , which were predicted and described by mandelstam @xcite for a hypothetical ( at that time ) fluid with negative group velocity .",
    "if the direction of propagation along the plane @xmath38 of all the quasiparticles with positive group velocities ( i.e. all except @xmath0 rotons ) , incident or created on the interface , is along the vector @xmath37 , the @xmath0 rotons will propagate in the opposite direction .",
    "the effect is analogous to andreev reflection of the quasiparticles on the interface of normal and superconductive phases of a supercunductor , with change of signs of electric charge and effective mass @xcite .",
    "two examples are shown on fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "+   two examples of backward refraction ( on the left ) and reflection ( on the right ) of @xmath0 rotons .",
    "the scheme on the left shows a phonon in the solid incident on the interface , and on the right a phonon of the quantum fluid is incident .",
    "the directions of propagation of the quasiparticles ( along their group velocities ) are shown by big arrows , and the small arrows beside them are their wave vectors .",
    "the directions are determined by the condition that the projections of all wave vectors onto the plane of the interface are equal to @xmath37.,width=325 ] * a form of snell s law holds for all the traveling waves involved in the process  incident , reflected and transmitted , so that the quantity @xmath91 is the same for all @xmath92 .",

    "thus all the angles of incidence , reflection and transmission are related through ( [ snell ] ) , and it also determines the number of traveling waves in each process .",

    "the partial transmission coefficients for @xmath98 are @xmath212 . in the most interesting case @xmath157",
    "then we obtain @xmath213    the asymptotes of the frequency dependencies of the transmission coefficients , at @xmath35 close to the roton minimum @xmath117 or maxon maximum @xmath118 , are determined by the factors that are functions of @xmath214 only . when @xmath215 , the small parameter is @xmath216 , and @xmath217 , therefore @xmath218 .",

    "the wave vectors of the traveling waves of superfluid helium are concentrated in a narrow cone around the normal : @xmath233 , and so @xmath234 for @xmath98 .",
    "therefore in the zero approximation of the small parameter @xmath235 , the angular dependencies of transmission coefficients are reduced to the multiplier @xmath236 @xmath237 and thus eq . ( [ d2 ] ) holds for any angles of incidence .    in terms of quasiparticles",
    "this result means that a phonon in the solid , incident on the interface with superfluid helium , creates @xmath0 rotons with much smaller probability than it creates phonons and @xmath1 rotons in the helium ( those probabilities are small themselves , too , due to the small coefficient of transmission of the wave at the interface ) .",

    "there , the @xmath0 rotons were created by collisions in the bulk liquid .",
    "let us consider the problem of a helium quasiparticle of type @xmath97 incident on the interface . it can be a phonon @xmath238 , @xmath0 roton @xmath239 or @xmath1 roton @xmath240 .",

    "the graphs of the four reflection coefficients as functions of the corresponding angles of incidence , at a fixed frequency @xmath340k and @xmath171 , are shown on fig.[fig6 ] and illustrate the peculiarities of angular dependencies of @xmath304 .",
    "coefficients @xmath341 and @xmath342 as functions incidence angles @xmath343 and @xmath344 respectively , @xmath340 k , @xmath171 .",
    "the curves are denoted by their respective pairs of subscripts @xmath334 , and the dashed line shows @xmath345 obtained in @xcite.,width=325 ]    comparing with the previous results @xcite , we see that the qualitative behavior of the probability curves is the same , but the numerical values differ by @xmath346% , with the exception of the curves for @xmath347 and @xmath315 .",
    "the probability @xmath347 is on average almost twice as large as its preliminary value , and @xmath315 is almost twice as small .",
    "this difference is clearly caused by the roughness of the approximation for the @xmath1 roton branch in @xcite .    from ( [ rij ] )",
    "we see that @xmath348 for @xmath307 .",
    "therefore for @xmath349 , when the incidence angle is close to @xmath350 , @xmath351 and the coefficient @xmath304 tends to zero as @xmath352 ; for @xmath246 , when the incidence angle is close to the critical angle @xmath279 , @xmath353 and the coefficient @xmath304 tends to zero as @xmath354 .",
    "this gives the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath355 at angles of incidence close to @xmath350 and of @xmath356 at incident angles close to the corresponding critical angles ( @xmath304 and @xmath357 are the same functions of @xmath35 and @xmath83 but different functions of respective incident angles @xmath338 and @xmath242 ) .",
    "we see that at grazing incidence , the only coefficients that do not tend to zero are @xmath358 and so the dominating processes are specular ( mirror ) reflections ; in the limit @xmath160 the transmission coefficients are zero and so @xmath359 .    when the incident angle for some quasiparticle @xmath92 increases and becomes greater that one of the critical angles @xmath279 ( @xmath360 ) , the root @xmath251 changes from being real to imaginary .",
    "therefore the structure of the coefficients @xmath304 changes even for those of them that do not tend to zero or unity .",
    "thus , if we consider an @xmath0 roton incident , when @xmath361 , @xmath362 tends to zero and @xmath363 have kinks .",
    "the numerator of a factor of @xmath364 in ( [ rij ] ) is @xmath365 , equal to @xmath366 .",
    "as @xmath182 changes from being real to imaginary , the real part of @xmath367 turns to zero . in the most simple case @xmath28 , which was analyzed in @xcite , the imaginary part without @xmath182 is @xmath368 and is of the order of the exponent of the one - dimensional kernel @xmath369 , which replaces @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) after fourier transforms by @xmath370 and @xmath371 .",
    "this exponent determines the effective correlation length in the @xmath22-direction for given @xmath83 .",
    "it was shown , that there is an angle @xmath372 a little greater than @xmath373 , for which @xmath367 tends to zero , and this corresponds to the penetration depth of the phonon wave @xmath374 being of the order of the effective one - dimensional correlation length in the quantum fluid .",
    "for this angle @xmath375 we have @xmath376 because @xmath377 , and also @xmath378 .",
    "therefore @xmath379 and the @xmath0 rotons are specularly reflected .",
    "the existence of such an angle enabled the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to suggest an experiment for detection of @xmath0 rotons by measuring the negative pressure that an @xmath0 roton beam would exert on a membrane .",
    "the absolute value of the pressure is greatest when the @xmath0 rotons are specularly reflected from it , without mode change , and this condition is satisfied for the incidence angle equal to @xmath375 .    in the general case ,",
    "the effective one - dimensional kernel is a sum of many exponents , which are now also functions of @xmath35 , but the combination of @xmath57 that enters the numerator @xmath367 still plays the role of some effective exponent .",
    "so @xmath345 will turn to unity if the penetration depth of the phonon wave becomes equal to the corresponding effective correlation length .",
    "we can see in fig.[fig6 ] , that this angle @xmath375 indeed exists for the @xmath4 that well approximates the dispersion relation of superfluid helium , as opposed to the rough approximation with @xmath28 used in @xcite .",
    "its value is about @xmath380 , as opposed to the previous result @xmath381 , the peak is not as sharp , and at larger angles @xmath345 is quite close to unity .",
    "this means that we only need to provide @xmath382 for the negative pressure of the @xmath0 roton beam to be measurable , though best results would be at @xmath383 .    comparing the graphs in fig.[fig6 ] with the analogous graphs of @xcite shows , that at angles less than the critical angle the difference is small , but when the incidence angle is greater than the critical angle , the difference increases . for comparison",
    ", the dashed line shows @xmath345 from @xcite .",
    "if we consider reflection from the free surface , then the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) are replaced by ( [ boundary - landau ] ) . for a solution",
    "@xmath384 , this expression turns into @xmath385 .",
    "the @xmath22-component of velocity of the surface in this case is @xmath386 , and therefore we have @xmath387 thus the ratio @xmath388 at @xmath19 is given not by ( [ pvin0- ] ) , but by ( [ bcfree ] ) .",
    "therefore the reflection coefficients from the free surface of superfluid helium are obtained by formally replacing @xmath298 in eqs .",
    "( [ rii]-[rij ] ) by @xmath389 the quantity @xmath390 is imaginary , so the structure of the coefficients is the same as when @xmath169 , and @xmath391 .",
    "the transition layer of helium atoms at the interface can be treated in the usual approach as multiple layers of continuous media with corresponding equilibrium densities and equations of state .",
    "this turns the problem into one of passing waves through this multilayered structure .",
    "then the solution in the outmost `` layer '' , the bulk fluid , is composed of @xmath113 , @xmath392 , @xmath393 and @xmath394 . the one thing that changes is the boundary conditions on the interface between this `` layer '' and the next , which alters the relative amplitudes of the four solutions in the particular solution .",
    "this is due to changes in @xmath139 ( [ z ] ) , or equivalently , @xmath298 ( [ knew ] ) ( or @xmath395 in ( [ kf ] ) ) , so the transmission ( [ d ] ) and reflection ( [ rii]-[rij ] ) coefficients also will change through the replacement of @xmath139 by some effective quantity .",
    "however , when considering the process of a solid s phonon incident on the interface , the solution in the fluid can only be @xmath113 , as it is the unique eigensolution that describes the fluid s reaction to outside influence ( with new effective @xmath139 ) . so the relative transmission coefficients , i.e. the ratios @xmath396 and @xmath397 , which are functions only of @xmath99 , stay exactly the same as derived in this paper and eq .",
    "( [ dpartial ] ) holds exactly quantitatively .",
    "thus the result on the weak creation and detection of @xmath398 rotons also holds .",
    "likewise there are no changes to the derived asymptotes and qualitative behavior of the reflection coefficients @xmath304 , as well as the critical angles @xmath279 , which depend only on the frequency and angular dependences of @xmath214 , and thus only on the dispersion relation of the bulk fluid .",
    "the influence of the microstructures of the interface can be taken into account by introducing the effective roughness of a solid surface .",
    "estimates were made in @xcite ( for phonons ) and show that this roughness does not change the results significantly .",
    "it can be noted , that it is also possible to take into account the layer of weakly - adsorbed atoms on the interface , see @xcite .",
    "incorporation of this analysis into our model would also lead to a change of the effective impedance @xmath139 ( [ z ] ) , in the way similar to the multilayered problem discussed above , with analogous consequences .",
    "in the current work we solve the problem of the interaction of superfluid helium phonons and rotons with interfaces in a consistent and unified way .",
    "we describe the quantum fluid in the dispersive ( nonlocal ) hydrodynamics approach , in which a medium s dispersion relation @xmath4 enters the equations explicitly and serves as the only input `` parameter '' .",
    "we present the consistent solution of the problem of the interaction of quasiparticles with the interface , for the case when their dispersion relation is arbitrary and nonmonotonic , so that @xmath7 is a polynomial of some degree @xmath9 .",
    "we solve the equations of nonlocal hydrodynamics in the half - space and discuss some general consequences of the solution s structure with regard to the problem of quasiparticles creation on interface .",
    "these are a generalization of snell s law ( [ snell ] ) with phase velocities as functions of frequency , the realization of backward reflection and backward refraction for @xmath0 rotons , existence of multiple critical angles corresponding to each pair of modes in the two the adjacent media .",
    "the creation probabilities , at the interface , of each quasiparticle of both media , phonons in the solid and phonons , @xmath0 rotons and @xmath1 rotons in the superfluid helium , are derived when any of them are incident on the interface ( [ d ] ) , ( [ dpartial ] ) , ( [ rii ] ) , ( [ rij ] ) .",
    "the obtained expressions are valid for all frequencies , below and above the roton gap , any incident angle , and effectively arbitrary dispersion relation of the quantum fluid .",
    "the peculiarities and asymptotic behaviour of the probabilities as functions of frequency and angles are analysed .",
    "this work includes and generalizes the results of refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , in which different specific special cases of dispersion relation were considered , and in the corresponding special cases , the expressions obtained here turn into the ones obtained earlier , so they are now presented from a single point of view .",
    "all the qualitative results of @xcite with regard to superfluid helium are confirmed , including the explanation why @xmath0 rotons were not detected in experiments until @xcite . for the suggestion of new experiments on @xmath0 rotons detection",
    ", we have adjusted the optimal angle of incidence .",
    "the general expressions obtained for the transmission and reflection coefficients allowed us to refine the dependencies obtained in @xcite for the superfluid helium - solid interface .",
    "we hope that the obtained results stimulate new experiments on the interaction of helium phonons and rotons with interfaces .",
    "let us show how the integro - differential equation ( [ eqp ] ) is brought to a riemann boundary value problem ( also called riemann - hilbert problem ) .",
    "the idea of this transition is called the wiener and hopf method .",
    "likewise we demand for the second function @xmath403 and at @xmath186 it will be defined so that the equation @xmath404 where integration now is made over the infinite space , should hold true on @xmath186 . at @xmath185",
    "it holds automatically .",
    "we are interested in @xmath407 as functions of @xmath33 , while @xmath35 and @xmath408 act as parameters . due to the demands ( [ a - p- > ] ) and ( [ a - p+ > ] ) , for the functions @xmath409 that grow not faster than power law at infinity , their fourier images ( [ a - ppmk ] ) @xmath410 and @xmath411 are analytical in the upper and lower half - plane of the complex plane of variable @xmath33 respectively .",
    "so the upper index indicates the half - plane of the complex plane @xmath33 , in which the respective function is analytical .",
    "( [ a - riemann ] ) holds for real @xmath33 , so in detailed notation we have @xmath412    this equality gives a linear relation on the real line between the limit values of functions @xmath410 and @xmath411 on it , which are analytical in the upper and lower half - planes of the complex variable @xmath33 respectively .",
    "therefore it defines a homogeneous riemann boundary value problem on the real line ( see for example @xcite ) with `` density ''",
    "@xmath413 its key parameter is the density s index , which can be calculated as difference between the number of plain zeros of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq ] ) in the upper half - plane @xmath43 of @xmath33 and the lower half - plane @xmath44 . as the function @xmath414 is even , the index of @xmath39 ( [ a - densityg ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "the riemann boundary problem with density @xmath39 , that is differentiable on the contour ( in our case it is the real line ) , does not tend to zero on it and has zero index , has a unique solution to within a multiplicative constant , provided that there is an additional condition on its asymptotic behaviour at infinity @xcite .",
    "our problem has two complications with regard to this standard case .",
    "first , @xmath39 has zeros in the real roots of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq ] ) , and second , it is unbounded at zero when @xmath42 .",
    "the detailed solution of this problem in the case of monotonic dispersion is given in appendix to @xcite , in the one - dimensional case , when @xmath42 .",
    "it was shown there , that the singularity of @xmath39 in zero changes the structure of the solution , which is still unique if we demand that @xmath129 is bounded at @xmath10 .",
    "as the three - dimensional solution has to turn into the one - dimensional one when @xmath42 , it has the same structure , notwithstanding the fact that the singularity takes place for a single value of the parameter @xmath83 .    the simplest way to bypass",
    "the first complication is to shift the real roots into the complex plane , while preserving the index of density @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath4 is monotonic , there are two real roots and so two ways of shifting while preserving the index .",
    "thus we obtain two linear - independent solutions , that play the same role as plane waves with positive and negative @xmath33 in the usual case of linear dispersion . when @xmath4 in non - monotonic , the situation is more complex . in @xcite the eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) , with the corresponding kernel , was solved explicitly by using a different method , for the special case when @xmath7 is a cubic polynomial and there are three positive roots of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq ] ) with regard to @xmath56 .",
    "it was shown there , that there are four linear - independent solutions with given @xmath35 and @xmath37 , and the general solution is their linear combination .",
    "it can be also shown , that these four solutions can be obtained by the wiener and hopf method by selecting appropriately which three of the six real roots of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq ] ) with regard to @xmath33 should be shifted up ( or , equivalently , down ) from the real line .",
    "all the rest of the @xmath415 solutions obtained this way are linear combinations of the four . as the structure and dimension of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) with given @xmath35 and @xmath37 can only depend on the number of possible traveling waves in them , we use the same scheme of roots shifting to derive all the linear - independent solutions of ( [ eqp ] ) in the case of arbitrary @xmath4 , which leads us to ( [ solution ] ) .",
