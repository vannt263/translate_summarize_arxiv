    "ordinary differential equations are one way physicists model physical phenomena . to solve them , a great variety of analytical and numerical methods are available in the literature @xcite",
    ".    trough this article we wish to solve some problems that arise in vibration theory making an analogy of them with a system of particles , a well known issue treated in statistical mechanics .",
    "if this analogy is made , all the tools used in statistical mechanics are available for tackling these type of problems .",
    "for example , one is able to calculate the entropy or the specific heat of the system , something which is , at least , difficult to imagine in a typical vibration problem . from a more general perspective , we extend the same analogy and apply it to find the solutions of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) of general type ( see section [ sec : mathematicalp ] ) .    the general method proposed here",
    "could be resumed in the following way . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the solution of an ode from the minimization of a functional . on the other hand ,",
    "a thermodynamic potential is represented by a functional .",
    "we connect these two notions , proposing the functional which leads to the solution of an ode , to be the interaction potential energy or thermodynamic potential of an equivalent particle problem .",
    "therefore , solving this statistical mechanics problem amounts to solve the ode . for the case where only one solution exists , the method allows to obtain the unique solution of the ode .",
    "clearly , when we treat vibrational problems , an eigenvalue equation must be solved with infinite possible solutions .",
    "this case our method is capable of obtaining the fundamental mode or absolute minimum of the corresponding functional .",
    "the principal aim of our work is to show ( a ) how the previously proposed correspondence is used to attain the solution of ordinary differential equations , ( b ) the theoretical basis upon which it is sustained and ( c ) the way it can be treated within a stochastic framework .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mathematicalp ] , we show how the problem of solving a general kind of ode can be transformed to a problem of minimization of a functional ( weak solution of the differential equation @xcite ) .",
    "section [ sec : statisticalt ] presents the foundations of equilibrium statistical analysis viewed as a minimization of a thermodynamic potential .",
    "this provides the theoretical the basis of our developed method .",
    "section [ sec : proposeda ] describes the general aspects of the numerical scheme and algorithm implementation .",
    "section [ sec : langevina ] is devoted to find the solution of an ode employing a stochastic framework .",
    "this method allow us to solve the ode proposing an equivalent langevin ( stochastic ) equation . at the end , in section",
    "[ sec : numericals ] , several numerical experiments which will sustain our theoretical hypothesis will be developed and solved .",
    "finally , some conclusions will be outlined .",
    "there are many possible approaches to find the solution of odes @xcite . from all of them , we are interested in that one which transforms the problem of finding the solution of an ode into the minimization of a functional . to do this we must recall some results of functional analysis .",
    "the most general form of an ode of order @xmath1 can be written as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an element of a hilbert space @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the derivative of order @xmath7 of @xmath3 .",
    "also @xmath8 ( @xmath9 hilbert space of functions square integrable in the domain @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 are functions continuous with their derivatives up to the @xmath12 order inclusive in the closed interval @xmath13 $ ] which satisfy @xmath14 , \\",
    "i=0,1, ... ,k-1\\ ] ] @xmath15 , \\ p = const.\\ ] ] for the rest of the paper , homogeneous boundary conditions will be considered with no loss of generality .",
    "then , it is possible to look for the generalized solution @xmath16 of equation ( [ eq : ode ] ) as that element which minimizes the functional @xmath17    in the corresponding hilbert space @xmath4 , where operator @xmath18 is defined .",
    "there exists a requirement of positive definiteness of operator @xmath18 that ensures that the extreme value of ( [ eq : funct ] ) or ( [ eq : eigen - funct ] ) is the desired solution @xmath16 of the problem .    for the eigenvalue problem , @xmath19 ,",
    "the functional to be minimized coincides with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath20 and it reduces to @xmath21 in this case , infinite minima exist , each of them corresponding to the associated eigenvalues @xmath22 equation ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) states that the first ( or fundamental ) eigenvalue @xmath23 is the minimum possible eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction is @xmath24 ; i. e. @xmath25 is the absolute minimum of @xmath26 @xcite .    summing up",
    ", a differential operator can be transformed into a functional so that minimizing this functional equals to solving the ode .",
    "as a second step towards attaining the solution of odes , we must adequate the problem to be treated as a standard particle problem in statistical mechanics . to this end , we must think on a @xmath27 particle system in a one dimensional box of size @xmath28 , where a point in the @xmath27 dimensional configurational phase space can be denoted by @xmath29 , being @xmath30 the position of particle @xmath31 .",
    "now , a link between the representation of this system in configurational phase space @xmath32 with the description of possible candidate solutions of the ode @xmath3 ( see equation [ eq : ode ] ) is proposed through an adequate discretization of @xmath3 .",
    "consider now any possible candidate to the solution of a particular kind of ode , named @xmath3 .",
    "this continuous function is an element in the corresponding hilbert space @xmath33 where operator @xmath18 is defined , and belongs to the domain of the functional @xmath26 .",
    "the proposed discretization of @xmath34 will be settled from the consideration of @xmath27 sites labelled with the discrete index @xmath35 of a 1 dimensional lattice .",
    "then , the function @xmath3 is taken as the limit @xmath36 from the field functions @xmath37 .",
    "so the link between our system of particles and that element @xmath3 is naturally settled as @xmath38 .",
    "each @xmath39 can take any value between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . a possible configuration of our @xmath27 particle system",
    "is then considered by specifying the value of @xmath39 at each site @xmath35 or simply the lattice vector @xmath42 . through this connection",
    ", it is possible to apply the whole statistical framework to treat this equivalent new problem .",
    "+      the next step is to formulate the problem as in standard statistical mechanics . to do this",
    ", we will consider our particle system in the canonical ensemble .",
    "so far we have made a connection between the domain of the functional @xmath26 with the microstates of a thermal system , represented by @xmath32 . with this in mind , and using the expression for the probability density in the canonical ensemble @xmath43 , our proposal is to define an equivalent problem , such that the hamiltonian @xmath44 is replaced by our functional @xmath45 i. e. @xmath46 here , as well as in standard statistical mechanics @xmath47 represents the partition function ( this time @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 can be considered a parameter equivalent to the temperature .",
    "automatically , this probability density maximizes a new  entropy \" , and lead us to pose an equivalent state equation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 can be thought as the corresponding helmholtz potential of the equivalent problem . in case of solving the eigenvalue problem in vibration theory , for example , @xmath45 turns to be rayleigh s quotient @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "a briefly mathematical support is given in appendix [ ap:1 ] which assures the mathematical possibility of the probability density proposed .",
    "summarizing , since our problem of solving the ode has been transformed into an equivalent thermal system , all the mathematical framework of statistical mechanics could be applied .",
    "for the sake of brevity , here we only outline how several typical thermodynamical equilibrium variables such as entropy and specific heat , could be calculated using previous relations . for example , for the specific heat @xmath53 we have , by definition    @xmath54}{t^2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 means equilibrium or ensemble average and could be calculated for each @xmath56 by monte - carlo sampling ( see section [ sec : proposeda ] ) .",
    "also the entropy could be obtained in the same form applying the well known relation @xmath57 which integrated , using equation ( [ eq : calor - especifico ] ) , give us @xmath58}{t'^3 } dt'\\ ] ] +",
    "having established this new equivalent problem , we apply the whole framework of equilibrium statistical analysis to obtain the extreme value of @xmath45 .",
    "our main tool for solving problems through this paper is based on metropolis monte - carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "briefly , this algorithm ensures a way to sample canonical ensemble proposing a transition probability @xmath59 which satisfies detailed balance . for our case",
    ", it takes the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 .    with this transition probability",
    ", we construct an algorithm that can sample our @xmath63__dimensional _ _ configurational phase space @xmath64 , whose limit as @xmath65 tends to hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "each equilibrium state , which can be reached by waiting sufficient time ( monte - carlo steps ) , is a function of parameter @xmath56 in which all possible configurations differ from each other in @xmath66 .",
    "obviously , this also means that for a given @xmath67 there exist many equilibrium configurations and only for @xmath68 it reduces to one .",
    "the proposed algorithm takes the previous idea and uses it in the same way as in standard simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "we ve just exposed that equilibrium states are governed by parameter @xmath56 .",
    "so , if one diminishes its value in a way so as to go through successive equilibrium states , then , the most representative points of the ensemble will be sampled . in the limit as @xmath69 ,",
    "each different configuration will differ from each other in an infinitesimal quantity which means , from the notion of a variation of a functional , that we reach a minimum @xmath70 ( solution of the ode ) . by this way",
    ", the algorithm is supposed to be capable of avoiding relative minima , providing the absolute minimum of the functional . for the eigenvalue problem , this allows only to obtain the fundamental mode and lowest eigenvalue .",
    "however , higher modes which correspond to relative minima , could be obtained in principle if we impose restrictions to the functional , such as symmetry or number of nodes ; these topics will be explored in future works .      here",
    ", we address the problem of generating candidate solutions @xmath71 from an existing one @xmath32 ( solution generation scheme ) . to attempt this end",
    ", we will first make a brief survey of the calculus of variations @xcite .",
    "the variation of a functional @xmath72 which depends on the function @xmath3 and its derivatives of order @xmath73 , @xmath74 is @xmath75    where by definition + @xmath76   \\delta u dx\\ ] ]    and @xmath77 is the variation of the function @xmath3 and is equal to @xmath78 , @xmath79 ; also @xmath80 is an arbitrary function satisfying sufficiently smooth conditions @xcite .",
    "our solution generation scheme starts generating a markov chain in which the next iterate is built from the previous one making the change @xmath81 .",
    "the proposal consists in taking @xmath82 in agreement with the master equation @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath83 steps ( fixed number of steps ) for a given @xmath56 .",
    "for the transition probability to have a value of 1/2 we set @xmath84 ; then , @xmath85 where equation ( [ eq : var - func ] ) has been used .",
    "now , it is possible to calculate @xmath86 considering the integral in ( [ eq : var - func ] ) as a sum over the @xmath27 sites of the lattice . according to this , and considering every @xmath87 identical and independent of @xmath88",
    ", we can calculate an estimation of the jump @xmath89 that satisfies ( [ eq : jumpq ] )    @xmath90    then , @xmath91 .",
    "this form of calculating @xmath92 is one possible way of setting an estimation to the jump to build the next iterate . of course , other possibilities are feasible to be implemented . however , it has the advantage of efficiently exploring configurational phase space in order to reach equilibrium states avoiding local minima ( if there exists one ) .",
    "it is a relevant problem to determine the initial temperature @xmath93 to start the algorithm .",
    "the one proposed by kirkpatrick @xcite for initial temperature guesses in standard simulated annealing technique ( sa ) , proves to be simple and very effective .",
    "obviously , other means are possible but we chose it for simplicity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it consists of conducting a pilot survey of the solution space in which all increases in the objective function ( the functional @xmath26 ) are accepted .",
    "the initial temperature is then calculated from ( [ eq : probtrans ] ) , once the initial transition probability @xmath94 has been given ( @xmath95 commonly selected ) , according to @xmath96 where @xmath97 is an average increase in the objective function , @xmath26 .",
    "according to this formula it is then possible to initiate the algorithm . to trigger it for the first time ,",
    "a high @xmath56 is chosen .",
    "then , compute @xmath98 for the first hundred of attempts and apply ( [ eq : inittemp ] ) .",
    "+ in the implementation of the algorithm , we decided to lower the temperature @xmath56 half an order of magnitude between different equilibrium states . then , we perform @xmath99 runs to compute different equilibrium averages for a given temperature to ensure we reach equilibrium . + since it is impossible to reach absolute zero as a limiting value of the temperature @xmath56 , a stopping criteria must be used as @xmath69 .",
    "this criteria could be condensed in the following way : the process of cooling of the system ends when , making a choice of a significative digit of the value of the functional being minimized , this digit averages to zero during the cooling procedure , while the other , more significative digits do nt change .",
    "an alternative treatment of the problem is to present it within a stochastic framework . to this end , we propose to model the system with the langevin equation .",
    "the use of langevin equation to stochastically sample an arbitrary field is not a new idea @xcite .",
    "however , the authors ignore that the same approach have been attempted to find solutions of odes . briefly , langevin equation is a stochastic differential equation whose coefficients are random with given stochastic properties @xcite .",
    "it defines @xmath100 as a stochastic process provided that an initial condition is added , @xmath101 .",
    "the developed method to solve odes consists of proposing a langevin equation for the scalar field @xmath3 in the simulation time @xmath102 , this is @xmath103 } { \\delta      u}+ \\eta(x , t)\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is a gaussian thermal noise with zero mean and that satisfies @xmath105 there is a certain arbitrariness on the selection of @xmath106 and @xmath107 but the product @xmath108 must satisfy einstein relation , i.e. @xmath109 to give the correct thermodynamical averages .",
    "it can be proved that the probability distribution @xmath110 approaches the equilibrium distribution @xmath111 as @xmath112 @xcite . to obtain the minimum of @xmath26 and consequently the solution of the ode",
    ", we must solve ( [ eq : langevin ] ) starting at a high temperature @xmath93 and then slowing it down gradually , which means passing through successive equilibria , until we reach a temperature near zero .",
    "following the same reasoning as before we will obtain , by this way , the absolute minimum of the functional .",
    "of course , the implementation of this cooling schedule is analogous to the previously developed procedure , so there is no need to go into detail again .    in the end , to make possible a numerical solution of the field equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) , we work with the same discretization scheme as above .",
    "this time , langevin equation for the scalar lattice field",
    "@xmath37 looks like @xmath113 } { \\delta      u_l(x_l)}+ \\eta(x_l , t ) \\hspace{0.2 in } l=1 .. n\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we present several odes which were solved applying the previously developed methods .",
    "the cases under study are three    * case 1 : helmholtz equation . * case 2 : fourth order beam equation . * case 3 : fourth order beam deflection under static load .",
    "the proposed methods provide , for the eigenvalue problem ( cases 1 and 2 ) , the absolute minimum of the functional ( lowest eigenvalue ) and the corresponding eigenfunction ( fundamental mode ) . for case 3 , this situation no longer exists since there is only one minimum of the functional and this represents the unique solution of the ode .      for the case of helmholtz equation , @xmath114",
    ", the corresponding functional @xmath26 reduces to    @xmath115    this result is obtained from equation ( [ eq : eigen - funct ] ) after an easy manipulation .",
    "fixed boundary conditions will be considered in this case , this means @xmath116 .",
    "the functional is named rayleigh quotient @xmath52 , as said before .",
    "physically , it can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy since , if the total energy of the system remains constant , one can assure that @xmath117 .    for a vibrating system ,",
    "let @xmath118 ; that is , @xmath119 is the maximum kinetic energy of the system during a cycle of motion , with the square of the natural frequency , @xmath120 , factored out .",
    "thus , from the total constant energy requirement , one can write    @xmath121    which is exactly ( [ eq : functhelmholtz ] ) with @xmath122 .    for the algorithm implementation , we start with a random function @xmath123 and then applies the solution generation routine and the transition probability @xmath59 of ( [ eq : probtrans ] ) together with the cooling schedule till the final temperature criterion is reached . for this case",
    "we have discretized the 1 dimensional lattice in 16 sites , i. e. @xmath124 .",
    "however , to compute the functional values @xmath26 , we have employed a cubic spline interpolation scheme using @xmath125 routines between @xmath39 s values which smooths the representation of @xmath3 to calculate @xmath26 .",
    "+ for the algorithm to perform the iterations over different configurations , new configurations are settled from old ones with a jump estimation @xmath126 that is calculated from equation ( [ eq : jumpu ] )    @xmath127    where @xmath128 represents galerkin s error function and @xmath129 . here",
    "@xmath130 as can be seen by comparing equations ( [ eq : deltauhelm ] ) and ( [ eq : jumpu ] ) . obviously , @xmath131 is only satisfied by the solution of the ode @xmath16 .",

    "the difference between the exact and final solution is below 3% .",
    "a statistical approximation to the solution of odes were presented , in particular we solved some problems related with vibration theory .",
    "the developed method establishes a way to attain the solution of an ode proposed to solve physical problems , from statistical mechanics .",
    "the developed idea consists of thinking the domain of any functional ( representing the ode ) as microstates of a thermal system ( particle system ) in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath56 , that interacts trough a thermodynamic potential represented by the functional .",
    "then , obtaining the minimum of the thermodynamic potential of this equivalent problem when @xmath133 is the same as to get the solution of the ode .",
    "if only one solution exists , our method provides the unique solution of the ode . in case",
    "we treat an eigenvalue equation , where infinite solutions exist , we obtain the absolute minimum of the corresponding functional or fundamental mode , as well as the fundamental eigenvalue .",
    "three examples have been provided to show the convergence of method to the solution of the odes ; the first two of them , represents a typical eigenvalue problem , as it is the case for the helmholtz equation and the fourth order beam equation , with infinite possible solutions . in these cases",
    "the method have shown to converge to the fundamental mode . for the third case ,",
    "the beam equation under a static load , the method converge to its unique solution .",
    "additionally , a resizing of the corresponding one dimensional lattice called  stable rezising \" , which increases the discretization , was used to provide further reductions of the functional accelerating its convergence and improving its precision .    in the same spirit , a general approach to the problem within an stochastic framework was presented with similar success .",
    "we proposed an equivalent langevin equation for the scalar field @xmath34 in its way to find the minimum of the functional , solution of the ode .",
    "numerical experiments have been run that showed that the method also converges to the exact solution for the helmholtz equation .",
    "of course , the other two cases , analyzed with the first developed method , can be treated within the same scheme but , for the sake of brevity , we postpone them for future works .    summarizing , the present article does not pretend to claim a place as an alternative method to other numerical , probably faster and more precise , methods .",
    "its virtue consists in that it is possible to establish a link between the problem of finding the solution of odes and an interacting particle system which can be treated by statistical mechanics ; in this sense , we showed that some typical thermodynamical equilibrium variables , such as entropy and specific heat , could be in principle calculated .",
    "this provides a different perspective and new insights in solving odes .",
