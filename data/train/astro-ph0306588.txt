    "our understanding of the baryon abundance has increased dramatically over the last few years .",
    "this improvement comes from two independent paths , namely big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "absorption features from high - redshift quasars allow to measure precisely the deuterium abundance , d / h . combined with bbn calculations ,",
    "this provides a reliable estimate of the baryon to photon ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "an independent determination of the baryon content of the universe from cmb anisotropies comes from the increasingly precise measurements of the acoustic peaks , which bear a characteristic signature of the photon - baryon fluid oscillations .",
    "the agreement between these two completely different approaches is both remarkable and impressive ( see details below ) .",
    "the time is therefore ripe to proceed and test the agreement between other light elements which are also probed both with bbn and cmb .",
    "the helium abundance has been measured for many years from astrophysical systems . however , the error - bars are seemingly dominated by systematic errors which are hard to assess .",
    "fortunately , the dependence of the helium mass fraction on the cmb anisotropies provides an independent way to measure @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this work is to present the first determination of the helium abundance from cmb alone , and to clarify the future potential of this method .",
    "the latest cmb data are precise enough to allow taking this further step , and in view of the emerging `` baryon tension '' between bbn predictions from observations of different light elements  @xcite possibly requires taking such a step .",
    "the advantage of using cmb anisotropies rather than the traditional astrophysical measurements , is that cmb provide a clear measurement of the primordial helium fraction before it could be changed by any astrophysical process . on the other hand",
    "the dependence of the cmb power spectrum on @xmath0 is rather mild , a fact which makes it presently safe to fix the value of the helium mass fraction with zero uncertainity for the purpose of cmb data analysis of other cosmological parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : bbn ] we review the standard big bang nucleosynthesis scenario .",
    "section  [ sec : cmb ] discusses the role of the helium mass fraction for cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the methods used and results .",
    "we discuss our forecast for future cmb observations in section  [ sec : future ] , and offer our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) has only one free parameter , namely the baryon to photon ratio @xmath4 , which for long has been known to be in the range @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "thus by observing just one primordial light element one can predict the abundances of all the other light elements .",
    "the deuterium to hydrogen abundance , d / h , is observed by ly-@xmath6 features in several quasar absorption systems at high red - shift , @xmath7  @xcite , which in sbbn translates into the baryon abundance , @xmath8 . using sbbn one",
    "thus predicts the helium mass fraction to be in the range @xmath9 .",
    "the dispersion in various deuterium observations is , however , still rather large , ranging from @xmath10  @xcite to @xmath11  @xcite , which most probably indicates underestimated systematic errors .",
    "the observed helium mass fraction comes from the study of extragalactic hii regions in blue compact galaxies .",
    "one careful study  @xcite gives the value @xmath12 ; however , also here there is a large scatter in the various observed values , ranging from @xmath13  @xcite over @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "besides the large scatter there is also the problem that the helium mass fraction predicted from observation of deuterium combined with sbbn , @xmath17 , is larger than ( and seems almost in disagreement with ) most of the observed helium abundances , which probably points towards underestimated systematic errors , rather than the need for new physics  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : compilation ] is a compilation of the above measurements , and offers a direct comparison with the current ( large ) errors from cmb observations ( presented in section iii below ) and with the potential of future cmb measurements ( discussed in section iii d ) .",
    "the observed abundance of primordial @xmath18 using the spite plateau is possibly spoiled by various systematic effects  @xcite . therefore it is more appropriate to use the sbbn predictions together with observations to estimate the depletion factor @xmath19 instead of using @xmath20 to infer the value of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the numerical predictions of standard bbn ( as well as various non - standard scenarios ) have reached a high level of accuracy  @xcite , and the precision of these codes is well beyond the systematic errors discussed above .      if the cmb - determined helium mass fraction turns out to be as high as suggested by sbbn calculations together with the cmb observation of @xmath21 ( as discussed above )",
    ", this could indicate a systematic error in the present direct astrophysical helium observations .",
    "alternatively , if the cmb could independently determine the helium value with sufficient precision to confirm the present helium observations , then this would be a smoking gun for new physics .",
    "in fact , one could easily imagine non - standard bbn scenarios which would agree with present observations of @xmath22 , while having a low helium mass fraction .",
    "all that is needed is additional non - equilibrium electron neutrinos produced at the time of neutrino decoupling which would alter the @xmath23 reaction .",
    "this could alter the resulting helium mass fraction while leaving the deuterium abundance unchanged .",
    "one such possibility would be a heavy sterile neutrino whose decay products include @xmath24 . a sterile neutrino with life - time of @xmath25 sec and with decay channel @xmath26 with @xmath27 a light scalar ( like a majoron ) , would leave the deuterium abundance roughly untouched , but can change the helium mass fraction between @xmath28 and @xmath29 if the sterile neutrino mass is in the range @xmath30 mev  @xcite",
    ". a simpler model would be standard neutrino oscillation between a sterile neutrino and the electron neutrino .",
    "the lifetime is about 1 sec when the sterile state has mass about 10 mev , and the decay channel is @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 any light lepton ) , and such masses and life - times are still unconstrained for large mixing angle  @xcite ( related bbn issues are discussed in refs .",
    "such possibilities are hard to constrain without an independent measurement of the helium mass fraction .",
    "another much studied effect of neutrinos is the increased expansion rate of the universe if additional degrees of freedom are present ( for bbn ) , and the degeneracy between the total density in matter and relativistic particles ( for cmb ) .",
    "this issue has recently been studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite in view of the new wmap results , and we need not discuss this further here .",
    "we thus fix @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "also an electron neutrino chemical potential could potentially alter the bbn predictions  @xcite , however , with the observed neutrino oscillation parameters the different neutrino chemical potentials would equilibrate before the onset of bbn  @xcite , hence virtually excluding this possibility ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "the recent wmap data allow one to determine with very high precision the epoch of photon decoupling , @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e.  _ the epoch at which the ionized electron fraction , @xmath35 , has dropped from 1 to its residual value of order @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the number density of free electrons , while @xmath38 is the total number density of h atoms ( both ionized and recombined ) . after this moment , photons are no longer coupled to electrons ( last scattering ) , and they free stream .",
    "the redshift of decoupling has been determined to be @xmath39 @xcite , which corresponds to a temperature of about 0.25 ev . helium recombines earlier than hydrogen , roughly in two steps : around redshift @xmath40 heiii recombines to heii , while heii to hei recombination begins around @xmath41 and finishes just after the start of h recombination  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    denoting by @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 the number densities per m@xmath44 of he atoms and baryons , respectively , the helium mass fraction is defined as @xmath45 .",
    "the baryon number density is related to the baryon energy density today , @xmath46 , by @xmath47 and we have @xmath48 . usually , the ionization history is described in terms of @xmath49 . however , for the purpose of discussing the role of @xmath0 , it is more convenient to consider the quantity @xmath50 instead , the ratio of free electrons to the total number of baryons . for brevity , we will call @xmath51 the free electron fraction . once the baryon number density has been set by fixing @xmath46 , one can think of @xmath0 as an additional parameter which controls the number of free electrons available in the tight coupling regime .",
    "the cmb power spectrum depends on the full detailed evolution of the free electron fraction , but we can qualitatively describe the role of helium in four different phases of the ionization / recombination history ( see fig .  [",
    "f : ionhist ] ) .    * before heiii recombination all electrons are free , therefore @xmath52 .",
    "* heii progressively recombines and just before h recombination begins , @xmath51 has dropped to the value @xmath53 . * after decoupling , a residual fraction of free electrons freezes out , giving @xmath54 . *",
    "reionization of all the h atoms gives @xmath55 .    during phase ( a )",
    ", the photon - baryons fluid is in the tight coupling regime .",
    "however the presence of ionized he increases diffusion damping , therefore having an impact on the damping scale in the acoustic peaks region . when the detailed energy levels structure of heii is taken into account  @xcite , the transition to phase ( b ) is smoother than in the saha equation approximation .",
    "therefore the plateau with @xmath56 is not visible in fig .",
    "[ f : ionhist ] . before h recombination",
    ", he atoms remain tightly coupled to h atoms through collisions , with the same dynamical behaviour .",
    "in particular , it is the total @xmath46 which determines the amount of gravitational pressure on the photon - baryons fluid , and which sets the acoustic peak enhancement / suppression .",
    "hence we do not expect the value of @xmath0 to have any influence on the boosting ( suppression ) of odd ( even ) peaks .",
    "the redshift of decoupling ( transition between ( b ) and ( c ) ) depends mildly on @xmath0 in a correlated way with @xmath46 , since the number density of free electrons in the tight coupling regime ( just before h recombination ) scales as @xmath57 .",
    "hence an increase in @xmath46 can be compensated by allowing for a larger helium fraction .",
    "an analytical estimate along the same lines as in e.g.  @xcite indicates that a @xmath58 change in @xmath0 affects @xmath59 by roughly @xmath60 , which corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "this is of the same order as the current 1-@xmath62 errors on @xmath59 , obtained by fixing @xmath63 .",
    "after h recombination , the residual ionized electron fraction @xmath64 does not depend on @xmath0 , but is inversely proportional to the total baryon density ( phase ( c ) ) .",
    "as the cmb photons propagate , they are occasionally rescattered by the residual free electrons .",
    "the corresponding optical depth , @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 performing the integral we can safely neglect the contribution of the cosmological constant at small redshift , since @xmath67 . retaining only the leading term , the approximated optical depth from the residual ionization fraction is estimated to be @xmath68 _ independent _ of the cosmological parameters and of the helium fraction . therefore after last scattering we do not expect any significant effect on cmb anisotropies coming from the primordial helium fraction , until the reionization epoch .",
    "fairly little is known about the exact reionization mechanism and its redshift dependence ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "observation of gunn - peterson troughs indicate that the universe was completely ionized after redshift @xmath69 , when the universe seemingly completed the reionization  @xcite , possibly for the second time  @xcite .",
    "if temperature information only is available , cmb anisotropies are sensitive only to the integrated reionized fraction , represented by the optical depth , independent of the specific reionization history . however , specific signatures are imprinted on the e - polarization and et - cross correlation power spectra by the detailed shape of the reionization history ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several physically motivated reionization scenarios , which however can not be clearly distinguished at present @xcite . in this work",
    "we use the most simple model , the sudden reionization scenario : we assume that at the reionization redshift @xmath70 all the hydrogen was quickly reionized , thus producing a sharp rise of @xmath37 from its residual value to @xmath38 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath70 is the redshift at which @xmath71 . in our treatment",
    "we neglect heii reionization , for which there is evidence at a redshift @xmath72 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this effect is small , since the extra electron released at @xmath73 would change the reionization optical depth by about only @xmath74 .",
    "we also neglect the increase of the helium fraction due to non - primordial helium production , which has a negligible effect on cmb anisotropies .",
    "those approximations do not affect the results at today s level of sensitivity of cmb data : for wmap noise levels , even inclusion of the polarization spectra is not enough to distinguish between a sudden reionization scenario and a more complex reionization history . at the level of planck a more refined modelling of the reionization mechanism will be necessary  @xcite .    in the sudden reionization scenario adopted here ,",
    "the relation between reionization redshift and reionization optical depth , @xmath75 , is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is physical time , @xmath3 is conformal time and @xmath78 the scale factor . here again , since the number density of reionized electrons scales as @xmath79 , the redshift of reionization is positively correlated with @xmath0 ( for fixed optical depth and baryon density ) .    as a result of the physical mechanism described above , a @xmath58 change in @xmath0",
    "has a net impact on the cmb power spectrum at the percent level .",
    "the impact on the cmb temperature and polarization power spectra is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : effect ] .    cdm model .",

    "polarization is induced by the temperature quadrupole component at last scattering .",
    "when reionization occurs , there is a generation of polarized power on the scale corresponding to the acoustic horizon size at the reionization redshift .",
    "this particular signature is called the `` reionization bump '' , and is clearly visible in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : effect ] in the @xmath81 region .",
    "the position of the bump in multipole space scales as @xmath82  @xcite . as discussed above , a change in the helium fraction implies a shift of the redshift of reionization for a given ( fixed ) optical depth , therefore the value of @xmath0 has an effect on the position of the reionization bump in the polarization power spectrum , but not on its height , which is controlled by the optical depth and is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "this effect is highlighted in the bottom panel : a 10% change in @xmath0 induces roughly a 10% change in the position of the bump .",
    "the subsequent two oscillatory features for @xmath84 reflect the displacement of further secondary , reionization induced polarization oscillations . however , since the value of polarized power is very low in that region , such secondary oscillations are very hard to detect precisely . in principle , given an accurate knowledge of the reionization history , the effect of @xmath0 on the polarization bump would assist into determining the helium abundance",
    ". however , our ignorance of the reionization history prevents us from recovering useful information out of the measured reionization bump .",
    "the displacement induced by @xmath0 is in fact degenerate with a partial reionization , or with other , more complex reionization mechanisms ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "hence constraints on @xmath0 come effectively from the damping tail in the @xmath85 region of the temperature spectrum , which needs to be measured with very high accuracy .",
    "other light elements like deuterium and helium-3 are much less abundant , and will therefore have even smaller effect on the cmb power spectrum , at the order of @xmath86 .",

    "we make use of the cbi @xcite and of the decorrelated acbar  @xcite band powers above @xmath94 to cover the small angular scale region of the power spectrum .    since @xmath0 is a rather flat direction in parameter space with present - day data , we find that a much larger number of samples is needed in order to achieve good mixing and convergence of the chains in the full 7d space .",
    "we use @xmath95 chains , each containing approximately @xmath96 samples .",
    "the mixing diagnostic is done on the same lines as in @xcite , by means of the gelman and rubin criterion @xcite .",
    "the burn - in of the chains also takes longer than in the case where @xmath0 is held fixed , and we discard 6000 samples per chain .",

    "thus , for the first time the primordial helium mass fraction has been observed using the cosmic microwave background .",

    "baryons and helium appear to be anticorrelated simply because present - day wmap data do not map the peaks structure to sufficiently high @xmath105 .",
    "precise measurements in the small angular scale region should reveal the expected positive correlation between the baryon and helium abundances , which is potentially important in order to correctly combine bbn predictions and cmb measurements of the baryon abundance .",

    "we can also easily impose a prior knowledge of the helium fraction , by fixing the value of @xmath0 , as it is usually done in present cmb analysis , and investigate how this modifies the expected error on the the baryon density .",
    "we numerically compute double sided derivative of the power spectrum around the fiducial model with cosmological parameters given in table  [ t : fiducial ] .",

    "we perform the fma for the expected capabilities of planck s high frequency instrument ( hfi ) and for an ideal cmb measurement which would be cosmic variance limited ( cvl ) both in temperature and in e - polarization ( and we do not consider the b - polarization spectrum ) , and therefore represents the best possible parameter measurement from cmb anisotropies alone .",
    "the complicated issues coming from foreground removals , point source subtractions , etc . are assumed to be already ( roughly ) taken into account in the experimental parameters for the experiment .",
    "those are the effective percentual sky coverage @xmath146 , the number of channels , the sensitivity of each channel @xmath147 for temperature ( t ) and e - polarization ( e ) in @xmath148k and the angular resolution @xmath149 ( in arcmin ) . for planck hfi",
    ", we take the 3 channels with frequencies 100 , 143 and 217 ghz , with respectively @xmath150 and @xmath151 and we have @xmath152 @xcite since the cvl is an ideal experiment , we put its noise to zero and assume perfect foregrounds removal , so that @xmath153 . in order to test the accuracy of our predictions and compare present - day results with the forecasts , we also perform an fma with wmap first year parameters , obtaining excellent agreement between the fma results and the error - bars from actual data .",

    "inclusion of the helium fraction increases the error on @xmath109 by roughly @xmath189 , from @xmath190 to @xmath191 .",
    "the correlation between the two parameters will have to be taken into account , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fmaypob ] .",
    "the expected correlation coefficient is @xmath192 for planck ( for cvl ) .",
    "the expected @xmath193 error on @xmath0 is about @xmath2 for planck , or @xmath194 .",
    "this is of the same order as the spread in current astrophysical measurements .",
    "we conclude that in planck - accuracy data analysis it will be necessary to include the uncertainty in the determination of the helium mass fraction , at least in the form of a gaussian prior over @xmath0 of the type we used in the cmb data analysis presented above .",
    "finally , measuring cmb temperature and polarization with cosmic variance accuracy would allow to constrain @xmath0 to within @xmath195 , or @xmath196 ( assuming flatness ) .",

    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the standard deviation on @xmath0 for planck is estimated to be @xmath197 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also consider an experiment ( cmbpol ) with characteristics similar to our cvl , for which they forecast @xmath198 , again in close agreement with our result . an earlier work  @xcite found for planck ( temperature and polarization ) @xmath199 , in satisfactory concordance with our result .",
    "it should be noticed that the forecast reported for map in table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath200 , is nothing but the gaussian prior @xmath201 which was assumed in their analysis .",
    "the main source of improvement for the determination of @xmath0 will be the better sampling of the temperature damping tail provided by planck and the cvl .",
    "polarization measurements have mainly the effect of reducing the errors on other parameters .",
    "in fact , we have checked that excluding from our fma the @xmath202 region of the e - polarization and et - correlation spectra changes the forecast precision on @xmath0 less than about 10 - 15% for planck and less than a few percent for cvl .",
    "this supports the conclusion that the low-@xmath105 reionization bump is not very useful in measuring the helium abundance , because of the degeneracy with @xmath70 .",
    "we have analysed the ability of cmb observations to determine the helium mass fraction , @xmath0 .",
    "we find that present data only allow a marginal detection , @xmath203 at 68% c.l .. this determination is completely independent from the usual astrophysical observations and uses cmb data only .",
    "we discuss degeneracies between @xmath0 and other cosmological parameters , most notably the baryon abundance , the redshift and optical depth of reionization and the spectral index .",
    "we conclude that present - day cmb data accuracy does not require the inclusion of @xmath0 as a free parameter .",
    "we find that planck will determine the helium mass fraction within @xmath2 ( or @xmath204 ) , which however will only allow a marginal discrimination between different astrophysical measurements .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that the uncertainty of the helium fraction will have to be taken into account in order to correctly estimate the errors on the baryon density from planck . to determine",
    "if the emerging baryon tension ( from bbn ) is related to underestimated systematic error - bars or whether it is an indication of new physics , cmb observation will have to be pushed very close to the cosmic variance limit in both temperature and polarization .",
