    "indeed , both exhibit a very similar behavior once more supporting the kondo - effect at the ruthenium site to be responsible for the heavy - fermion properties of lacu@xmath1ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "one could infer that moriya s spin - fluctuation theory @xcite accounts for the electronic mass enhancement in lacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 .",
    "in that case one would expect a divergence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate close to the magnetic instability,@xcite which in lacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 coincides with the mit .",
    "however , such a divergent behavior is not observed in the magnetic resonance experiments presented here .",
    "therefore , the kondo - effect appears to be the most applicable scenario in these ruthenates under investigation .",
    "to conclude , we have compared magnetic , thermodynamic , and transport properties of lacu@xmath1ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 with @xmath45cu , @xmath43ru , and @xmath44la nmr / nqr as well as gd@xmath50 esr to analyze the heavy - fermion behavior at the ru - rich side of the phase diagram above the metal - to - insulator transition @xmath170 .",
    "the quadratic low - temperature behavior of the electrical resistivity , the enhanced sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat , and the large pauli - like low - temperature susceptibility characterize the compounds with high ruthenium content @xmath171 as heavy - fermions with moderately enhanced effective masses .",
    "the corresponding wilson and kadowaki - woods ratios are comparable to those of canonical @xmath9-based heavy - fermion compounds . in the adjacent regime of intermediate ruthenium content @xmath172 the coherent heavy - fermion state breaks down giving rise to a kondo - like increase of the resistivity on decreasing temperature as typically observed in canonical @xmath9-based kondo lattices on dilution of the kondo ions .",
    "this observation suggests the spin fluctuations of the @xmath125 ru@xmath29 ions due to their screening by the conduction electrons to be responsible for the heavy - fermion formation .",
    "this hypothesis is corroborated by the nmr and esr measurements probing the local susceptibility at different lattice sites : while valence fluctuations strongly reduce the @xmath43ru - nmr line shift in cacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 , the unreduced shift proves the stability of the ruthenium valence in lacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 down to lowest temperatures . at the same time",
    "the @xmath45cu line shift is comparable in both compounds .",
    "however , the line shift at the lanthanum site in lacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 reproduces the curie - weiss behavior of the static susceptibility with a tendency for saturation below 50  k in agreement with the coherent fermi - liquid state at @xmath173 . from the nqr spin - lattice relaxation rates at the different lattice sites",
    "analogous information is obtained : while the @xmath45cu @xmath47 is not significantly enhanced with respect to normal metals , the @xmath163ru @xmath47 appears to be enormously enhanced - in the la compound even stronger than in the ca compound - as ru nmr spectra could be only obtained at lowest temperature in lacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 due to fast relaxation .",
    "substitution of ruthenium by titanium does not affect the slow @xmath45cu @xmath47 spin - lattice relaxation rate indicating the copper site to be nearly decoupled from the processes at the ruthenium site .",
    "finally , gd - esr at the lanthanum site yields the spin - lattice relaxation rate gd@xmath50 @xmath47 typical for a heavy - fermion system with @xmath174k proportional to the local susceptibility . on substitution of ruthenium by titanium this relaxation contribution",
    "is gradually diminished , once more proving the ruthenium ions to be responsible for heavy - fermion formation .",
    "these combined experiments allow identifying the kondo effect and resulting spin flucuations of the localized ru@xmath29 spins to be the source of heavy - fermion formation in lacu@xmath1ru@xmath14o@xmath4 .",
    "the localized nature of the ruthenium spins is supported by the local properties proven by nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance .",
    "this resembles the very similar behavior observed in @xmath9 based intermetallic kondo - lattice compounds .",
    "frustration as a source of heavy - fermion behavior can be ruled out , since the ru sites form a simple cubic sublattice .",
    "dilution of the ru@xmath29 kondo lattice by nonmagnetic ti@xmath29 results in single - ion kondo properties , which gradually weaken with increasing ti concentration and finally are suppressed at the metal - to - insulator transition , where the itinerant electrons localize at the cu sites .",
    "in addition , this localization gives rise to the quantum phase transition into the spin - glass state without any mass enhancement , ruling out the metal - to - insulator transition as source of heavy - fermion formation .",
