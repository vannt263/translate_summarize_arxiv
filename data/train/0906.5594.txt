    "the relatively nearby bright gamma ray burst ( grb ) 090618 that was discovered by the swift broad alert telescope ( bat ) on june 16 , 2009 at 08:28:29 ut ( schady et al .",
    "2009a ) provides another good opportunity to investigate the association of long duration grbs with supernova explosions and to test theoretical models of long grbs ( e.g. malesani 2009 , dado and dar 2009 ) .",
    "two such models have been used extensively to analyze grbs and their afterglows ( ags ) , the fireball ( fb ) model ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , mszros  2006 ; zhang  2007 ) and the cannonball ( cb ) model ( e.g. dado & dar & de rjula 2002 , hereafter ddd002 , dar & de rjula  2004 , hereafter dd2004 ; dado & dar & de rjula 2009a , b , hereafter ddd2009a , b , and references therein ) .",
    "the two models are quite different and at most only one can correctly describe grbs . until recently , the fb model has been widely accepted as that one . however , the rich data on grbs and their afterglow accumulated from space based observations , in particular from the swift and fermi satellites , from early time observations with ground based robotic telescopes and from late - time follow - up observations with large telescopes , have challenged this prevailing view ( ddd2009a and references therein ) : synchrotron radiation ( sr ) , the only radiation mechanism in the original fb model , can not explain simultaneously the prompt optical emission and the hard x - ray and gamma - ray emission from grbs which were both well measured in some bright grbs such as 990123 and 080319b .",
    "the prompt hard x - ray and gamma - ray pulses can not be explained by synchrotron radiation from internal shocks generated by collisions between conical shells .",
    "neither can sr explain their typical energy , spectrum , spectral evolution , pulse - shape , rapid spectral softening during their fast decay phase and the established correlations between various observables .",
    "moreover , the early time high energy emission is uncorrelated to the prompt kev - mev emission and lags behind it . as for grb afterglow ( ag ) , contrary to the predictions of the fb model , the broad band ag of grbs is highly chromatic at early times , the ags of the brightest grbs do not show jet breaks , and , in canonical ags where breaks are present , they are usually chromatic and do not satisfy the closure relations expected from fb model jet breaks .    the situation concerning the cb model is different .",
    "the predictions of the model which were derived in fair approximations from its underlying assumptions were shown to describe correctly the main observed properties of grbs and to reproduce successfully the diverse broadband lightcurves of large representative sets of both long grbs and xrfs ( e.g. , ddd2009a and references therein ) and short hard bursts ( ddd2009b ) , in particular of relatively nearby bright grbs with precise and well sampled lightcurves . here",
    "we repeat the exercise of predicting from early time observations the entire late time behaviour of the afterglow of the recent , relatively nearby , bright long grb 090618 and the emergence of a photometric and spectroscopic signature of an sn akin to sn1998bw in its lightcurve before their observations .",
    "at 08:28:29 ut , the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggered and located the bright long duration gamma ray burst ( grb ) 090618 ( schady et al .",
    "2009a ) at redshift @xmath1=0.54 ( cenko et al .",
    "2009b ) . about 90% of the grb energy measured by bat was emitted within t90=113s ( baumgartner et al .",
    "the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began follow up observations of its x - ray lightcurve ( see fig .  1 ) 124",
    "s after the bat trigger and its uvo telescope detected its optical ag 129s after trigger ( schady et al .",
    "the burst was detected also by agile ( longo et al .",
    "2009 ) , fermi gbm ( mcbreen et al .  2009 ) , suzaku wam ( kono et al .  2009 ) , konus - wind and konus - rf ( golenetskii et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the burst light curve showed a smooth multipeak structure with 4 prominent peaks ( one followed by three much brighter overlapping peaks ) with a total duration of  160 s. significant spectral evolution was observed during the burst .",
    "the spectrum at the maximum count rate , measured from t+62.720 to t+64.0 s , was well fitted ( golenetskii et al .",
    "2009 ) in the 20 kev - 2 mev range by the band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) with a low - energy photon index -0.99 ( -0.06 , + 0.07 ) , a high energy photon index -2.29(-0.5 , + 0.23 ) , and peak energy ep=440@xmath270 kev while the time integrated spectrum had a low - energy photon index -@xmath3 a high energy photon index -2.66(-0.2 , + 0.14 ) , and a peak energy ep=186@xmath48 kev .",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy in the 8 - 1000 kev band was @xmath5 erg ( standard cosmology ) .",
    "the bright optical afterglow of grb090618 was first detected by the rotse iii robotic telescope 23.9 s after the bat trigger ( rujopakarn et al .",
    "2009 ) and by the palomar 60-inch telescope ( cenko et al .",
    "2009a ) , the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( perley et al .  2009 , li et al .  2009 ) and the uvo telescope aboard swift ( schady et al .",
    "2009a ) within 2 minutes after trigger .",
    "absorption features which were detected in its bright optical ag with the 3 m shajn telescope at lick observatory yielded a redshift of @xmath1=0.54 .",
    "its optical ag was followed up by many telescope and reported shortly after in gcn circulars ( see table i ) .",
    "its r band light curve reported in these gcn circulars before june 27 , 2009 is shown in fig .  2  .",
    "in the cannonball ( cb ) model ( ddd2002 , dd2004 , ddd2009a , and references therein ) long - duration grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of highly relativistic cbs of ordinary matter which are ejected ( shaviv & dar  1995 , dar & plaga  1999 ) in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions akin to sn 1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "their prompt mev gamma - rays and hard x - rays are produced by the thermal electrons in the cbs plasma by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of glory photons - photons emitted / scattered into a cavity created by the wind / ejecta blown from the progenitor star prior to the sn .",
    "when the cbs cross the wind / ejecta and coast through the interstellar medium ( ism ) behind it , the electrons of the ionized gas in front of them that are swept in and fermi accelerated by the cbs turbulent magnetic fields emit synchrotron radiation ( sr ) which dominates the ` prompt ' optical emission and the broad band afterglow emission .",
    "ics of the sr radiation by these electrons and the decay of @xmath6 s produced in collision between the swept - in wind and ism protons and the ambient cb protons produce the ` prompt ' high energy emission simultaneously with the optical emission . within the cb model ,",
    "the above radiation mechanisms with the burst environment suffice to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the observed radiations from grbs at all times and all detected wavelengths .      in the cb model , the observed optical light has three origins : the ejected cbs , the sn explosion , and the host galaxy .",
    "the optical light curve is the sum of their energy flux density : @xmath7 = f_{cb}[\\nu , t ] + f_{sn}[\\nu , t ] + f_{hg}[\\nu , t]\\ , .",

    "a faint object is visible in the sdss r and i frames at the position of the optical afterglow , likely its host galaxy .",
    "compared to nearby sdss stars , its r magnitude was estimated by malesani ( 2009 ) to be @xmath9 .",

    "the scarcity of data points during the rise part of the peaks allows for other equally good fits .",
    "a careful subtraction of the host galaxy contribution from the optical lightcurve of grb090618 measured with large telescopes of good spatial resolution should have shown already ( on june 29 , 2009 ) spectroscopic and photometric evidence for an underlying supernova if its brightness is similar to that of sn1998bw . as of today",

    "the detailed data on the broadband afterglow of grb090618 , which is less bright than that of grb030329 , can still provide another useful test of the long - duration grb - sn association and of grb models .",
