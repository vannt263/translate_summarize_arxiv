    "three - dimensional relativistic fermionic systems have extensively been investigated in the literature in a variety of scenarios . on the one hand , they are per se interesting field theories with unconventional features , on the other hand they allow for fascinating applications to condensed - matter systems .",
    "in particular , three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath1 ) or the thirring model @xcite are actively discussed , e.g. , as effective theories describing different regions of the phase diagram of high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors @xcite and , recently , the electronic properties of graphene @xcite . especially graphene since its first synthesis in 2004 @xcite is being lively discussed in the rapidly growing literature on this subject , also because it offers the appealing opportunity of a comparatively simple experimental realization of some up to now unobserved quantum relativistic phenomena , such as the klein paradox @xcite or zitterbewegung @xcite ; for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "more exotically , some features of 3@xmath3 relativistic fermion systems can serve as toy models , e.g. , for the standard model of particle physics @xcite , or a possible candidate for a `` theory of everything '' @xcite .",
    "however , qed@xmath1 @xcite and the three - dimensional thirring model @xcite are likewise intrinsically interesting , in particular because the ground states in these theories are expected to show a sensitivity to the number of fermion flavors @xmath0 .",
    "several approximate solutions of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) predict that chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath4sb ) is prohibited once @xmath0 is larger than a critical value @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a similar quantum critical phenomenon has also been identified in many - flavor qcd@xmath6 @xcite , being currently under intense investigation also because of its potential relevance for technicolor scenarios @xcite and its implications for the thermal phase boundary @xcite .",
    "the search for the quantum critical point in the thirring model has so far been rather challenging : different dse approaches , e.g. , have yielded values between @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recent extensive lattice simulations now point to @xmath9 @xcite . for physical graphene and cuprates , the number of flavors is @xmath10 , such that the true value of @xmath5 may be of profound importance for physical effects corresponding to chiral symmetry breaking in the effective theories .",
    "in fact , a dynamically induced mass gap in the band structure of graphene , corresponding to a semimetal - mott insulator quantum phase transition , could provide extraordinary applications for graphene - based electronics , offering a possible new candidate material to take over from si - based technology @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we take a more fundamental viewpoint in order to investigate the amount of universality that can be attached to a possible value for @xmath5 .",
    "naively , a universal answer for @xmath5 may not be apparent as 3@xmath3 fermion models are perturbatively nonrenormalizable .",
    "nevertheless , renormalizability of the 3@xmath3 thirring model to any order in a large-@xmath0 expansion has been shown in @xcite , with a diagrammar being very similar to qed@xmath1 .",
    "this has been taken as an indication that the thirring model can indeed by defined nonperturbatively in 3@xmath3 , providing the same amount of universality as any perturbatively renormalizable theory .",
    "universality and , more profoundly , uv completeness can , in fact , be analyzed within weinberg s scenario of asymptotic safety @xcite , in which a uv complete infinite - cutoff limit can be taken at a potentially non - gauian fixed point .",
    "the resulting theories are predictive and exhibit universality , if the number of rg relevant directions at the fixed point are finite . in this work ,",
    "we re - examine renormalizability of the 3@xmath3 thirring model from this viewpoint by means of the functional renormalization group formulated in terms of the wetterich equation @xcite . using a purely fermionic rg as a first step ,",
    "the uv fixed - point structure can indeed be mapped out , on the one hand confirming the large-@xmath0 results , but also revealing interesting deviations from the large-@xmath0 asymptotics .",
    "for instance , we can identify a non - gauian uv fixed point that defines a `` thirring universality class '' which , however , corresponds to a pure thirring coupling only in the strict large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "in addition , we find further fixed points which may be associated with phase transitions ( and corresponding new universality classes ) , e.g. , towards a parity broken phase .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetries ] , we analyze the discrete and continuous symmetries of the classical theory .",
    "we classify the different possible mass terms as well as all possible fermionic interaction channels in the point - like four - fermion limit . with the aid of the functional rg",

    "[ sec : rg - flow ] , followed by an analysis of the fixed - point structure of the given class of models for varying number of fermion flavors in sec .  [ sec : fixed - points ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we classify the resulting rg trajectories to the long - range physics , pointing to the existence of various phases with dynamical mass generation , and obtain a first glance at a possible mechanism for the formation of a critical flavor number , above which chiral symmetry breaking disappears .",

    ", we expect the flow to be dominated by the vector channel @xmath200 which agrees precisely with the dominant bosonic degree of freedom in a large-@xmath0 analysis @xcite .",
    "as there is no chiral symmetry breaking at large @xmath0 , it is natural to expect a quantum phase transition to occur for increasing @xmath0 while the line @xmath198 undergoes a transition from the njl - regime @xmath201 to the large-@xmath0 regime where @xmath176 .",
    "unfortunately , a more quantitative picture of this quantum phase transition is difficult to obtain in the purely fermionic language .",
    "a quantitative rg analysis requires the inclusion of dynamical chiral ( i.e. , njl - type ) and vector bosonic degrees of freedom in order to study the interplay of these competing orders as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this is left for future work .",
    "fixed - point positions and separatrices in the ( @xmath202 ) coupling plane as a function of flavor number for @xmath203 .",

    "let us determine the flavor number where the separatrix @xmath198 is half way in - between the generalized njl model on the one hand and the pure thirring coupling on the other hand .",
    "this value of @xmath0 follows from @xmath204 and is given by @xmath205 .",
    "we stress that this number should not be viewed as a direct estimate of @xmath5 , as the onset of true critical behavior can easily provide further correction factors of order @xmath206 .",
    "comparison of non - universal critical thirring couplings from different methods .",
    "solid lines display the critical couplings from this work taken as the @xmath171 coordinate of the intersection point of the separatrix  @xmath207 with the thirring axis @xmath199 for the sharp cutoff ( upper solid / brown line ) or the linear regulator ( lower solid / red line ) .",
    "dotted : monte carlo results ( magenta with circles : @xcite , purple with squares : @xcite ) . dashed : dse approaches ( from right to left : green @xcite , cyan @xcite and blue @xcite ) . ]",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with those obtained by other methods such as monte carlo simulations or truncated dses .",
    "a variety of studies have computed the modulus of the critical thirring coupling which is a necessarily required for chiral symmetry breaking ( but not sufficient beyond the critical flavor number ) .",
    "two cautionary remarks are in order : first of all , these critical couplings similarly as the fixed - point values are not universal , such that the choice of the regularization scheme can have a strong quantitative influence on the estimated values .",
    "second , most other studies have defined the microscopic thirring model exactly on the thirring axis @xmath176 ; in principle , the full coupling plane has to be considered such that the critical coupling on the axis may be different ( larger in modulus ) from a corresponding estimate directly at the fixed point .    to circumvent the second caveat",
    ", we also consider the coupling on the thirring axis @xmath199 with an initial value of the coupling @xmath171 above the separatrix which interpolates between the fixed points @xmath175 and @xmath46 .",
    "then the theory is in the region i or iiia , depending on the sign of @xmath171 , such that the rg flow drives the couplings to the free theory at gauian fixed point @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of the @xmath171 coordinate of the intersection point of this separatrix with the thirring axis provides a lower bound for the absolute value of the critical coupling @xmath208 at which the @xmath4sb phase transition occurs .",
    "we compare this lower bound for different regulator functions @xmath117 with the values of the critical coupling obtained by monte carlo simulations @xcite and different sequences of truncated dse approaches @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crit - coupling ] , we plot this inverse coupling @xmath209 for varying number of flavors @xmath210 . for the sharp cut - off as well as for the linear cut - off",
    "our results lie well above the values obtained by dse approaches but below the values from lattice - regularized monte carlo simulations .",
    "note that similar to the lattice and one of the dse results , we do not observe a sharp decay of the inverse critical coupling .",
    "this behavior would indicate a sharp growth of @xmath208 above a certain number of flavors , corresponding to a critical flavor number in the infinite coupling limit .",
    "instead , we observe a rather smooth dependence on @xmath0 as on the lattice for @xmath211 , which is compatible with our expectation that the quantum phase transition towards the chirally symmetric phase occurs because of competing large-@xmath0 degrees of freedom and not because of a change in the uv critical structure .",
    "in this work , we have investigated 3@xmath3 relativistic fermionic models in a theory space , defined by chiral and a set of discrete symmetries and point - like interactions . even though the construction of these models has been inspired by the uniquely fixed 2@xmath3 thirring model ,",
    "the corresponding 3@xmath3 symmetries involving a reducible 4-component dirac spinor representation enlarge the minimal coupling space and give room for a larger fixed - point structure and thus for different microscopic realizations of such fermion models .",
    "we have classified all point - like interactions satisfying the symmetry constraints and determined their rg flow in a systematic next - to - leading order derivative expansion .",
    "the fact that leading - order and next - to - leading order results are identical as the anomalous dimension remains zero can be interpreted as a signature for the convergence of the expansion , as long as no further composite channels develop a strong rg flow .",
    "the resulting flow equations for the two independent fermionic couplings generate a fixed - point structure of one trivial gauian and three interacting fixed points @xmath168 which can be classified by their critical exponents .",
    "we associate all rg trajectories emanating from the fixed point @xmath46 with fully renormalized uv complete versions of the 3@xmath3 thirring model ; as this fixed point has one rg relevant direction , fixing one physical scale suffices to obtain a fully ir predictive quantum field theory in the thirring universality class .",
    "fixed point @xmath172 which , incidentally , lives in an rg invariant sub - manifold of theory space ( defined by @xmath212 ) is also characterized by only one rg relevant direction . from the nature of the scalar channel associated with this coupling direction ,",
    "we conjecture that this fixed point can be related to a critical point of a 2nd order phase transition to a phase with broken parity .",
    "the third interacting fixed point @xmath175 has two relevant directions ; depending on the initial conditions , theories emanating from this fixed point can flow to the thirring phase as well as to the parity - broken or symmetric phases .",
    "unfortunately , our purely fermionic rg analysis does so far not permit us to reliably run towards or into the symmetry - broken phases .",
    "such a quantitative description is required in order to analyze the true ir behavior of the thirring phase . from the structure of the fermionic flow , in particular , from the behavior of the separatrix @xmath198",
    ", we conjecture that the long - range dynamics is characterized by a competition between njl - type chiral condensation channels on the one hand and large-@xmath0-type vector bosons on the other hand .",
    "as the vector - boson fluctuations generically inhibit chiral symmetry breaking , we expect the occurrence of a quantum phase transition of the thirring model at a critical flavor number @xmath5 , separating a broken phase for small @xmath0 from a disordered phase for large @xmath0 .",
    "our very rough estimate of the transition region in any case is compatible with the findings from lattice simulations indicating that @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "our results on the position of the thirring fixed point @xmath46 being actually away from the pure thirring axis @xmath176 for any finite @xmath0 provokes an important comment : both lattice simulations as well as dse studies build on a microscopic definition of the 3@xmath3 thirring model which is fixed only with the thirring coupling , i.e. , by a pure bare thirring - like action .",
    "our fixed - point results indeed provide a fundamental justification for this , as the thirring fixed point indeed is characterized by only one relevant direction . as long as the microscopic actions chosen in other formulations are in a sufficiently attractive domain of the thirring fixed point , universality guarantees",
    "that the long - range physics is indeed purely governed by the thirring fixed point .",
    "we expect this to hold also for the determination of the critical flavor number ( there is no universality for quantities such as the scheme - dependent critical coupling , see fig .",
    "[ fig : crit - coupling ] ) . nevertheless , one caveat should be emphasized : this conclusion about universality only holds , as long as the microscopic bare actions indeed are in the attractive domain of the thirring fixed point .",
    "for instance , if by accident a lattice formulation turned out to be influenced by fixed point @xmath175 , the simulation would simply describe a model different from the thirring model potentially exhibiting a different quantum phase transition as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "as the fixed - point positions are not universal , our results are unfortunately not directly transferable to the lattice theory space .",
    "however , provided that the fixed - point structure is qualitatively similar , our results can be taken as a support for the implicit assumption that the lattice simulations have indeed been performed in the real thirring universality class .",
    "given the importance of the quantitative value of the critical flavor number @xmath5 of the thirring model in the light of condensed - matter applications , a natural next step of our studies will be the inclusion of composite degrees of freedom in order to study the competition among the various bosonic channels .",
    "within the functional rg , this can conveniently be investigated by means of partial or dynamical bosonization @xcite . as the problem of competing order is a paradigmatic one in ( quantum ) critical phenomena and statistical physics @xcite , we consider the relativistic 3@xmath3 thirring model as an ideal test case .",
    "let @xmath213 define an inner product on the space of @xmath16 dirac matrices .",
    "the @xmath84 matrices @xmath214 in eq .",
    "are orthogonal with respect to this product , @xmath215 and thus define a complete basis of the @xmath16 dirac matrices ( which generically have @xmath84 independent matrix elements ) , @xmath216 the fierz transformations are straightforwardly obtained by multiplying the completeness relation by each of the 4-fermi terms @xmath217 and , where appropriate , decomposing multiple products of dirac matrices into basis elements @xmath218 .",

    "<S> we investigate the uv fixed - point structure of the three - dimensional thirring model by means of the functional renormalization group ( rg ) . </S>",
    "<S> we classify all possible 4-fermi interactions compatible with the present chiral and discrete symmetries and calculate the purely fermionic rg flow using a full basis of fermionic four - point functions in the point - like limit . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the uv complete ( asymptotically safe ) thirring model lies in a two - dimensional coupling plane which reduces to the conventional thirring coupling only in the strict large-@xmath0 limit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the thirring universality class which is characterized by one relevant direction ( also at finite @xmath0 ) , two further interacting fixed points occur which may define new universality classes of second - order phase transitions also involving parity - broken phases . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-dependence of the thirring fixed point sheds further light on the existence of an @xmath0-controlled quantum phase transition above which chiral symmetry remains unbroken for arbitrary large coupling , even though a definite answer will require a direct computation of competing orders . </S>"
