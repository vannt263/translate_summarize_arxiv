    "in 1930  exactly 75 years ago , the existence of solid dust particles in interstellar space was by the first time firmly established , based on the discovery of color excesses ( trumpler 1930 ) .",
    "but the history of the interstellar dust - related studies is a much longer and complex subject , and can be dated back to the late 18th century when herschel ( 1785 ) described the dark markings and patches in the sky as `` holes in the heavens '' .",
    "below is a summary of the highlights of this history . for a more detailed record of the historical development of dust astronomy ,",
    "i refer the interested readers to aiello & cecchi - pestellini ( 2000 ) , dorschner ( 2003 ) , li & greenberg ( 2003 ) , and verschuur ( 2003 ) .",
    "+    * as early as 1785 , sir william herschel noticed that the sky looks patchy with stars unevenly distributed and some regions are particularly `` devoid '' of stars .",
    "he described these dark regions ( `` star voids '' ) as `` * holes in the heavens * '' .",
    "* at the beginning of the 20th century , astronomers started to recognize that the `` starless holes '' were real physical structures in front of the stars , containing * dark obscuring masses of matter * able to absorb starlight ( clerke 1903 ; barnard 1919 ) , largely thanks to the new technology of photography which made the photographic survey of the dark markings possible .",
    "sir harold spencer jones ( 1914 ) also attributed the dark lanes seen in photographs of edge - on spiral galaxies to obscuring matter . whether the dark lanes in the milky way is caused by obscuring material was one of the points of contention in the curtis - shapley debate ( shapley & curtis 1921 ) . * wilhelm struve ( 1847 ) noticed that the apparent number of stars per unit volume of space declines in all directions receding from the sun .",
    "he attributed this effect to * interstellar absorption*. from his analysis of star counts he deduced an visual extinction of @xmath0 .",
    "many years later , jacobus kapteyn ( 1904 ) estimated the interstellar absorption to be @xmath1 , in order for the observed distribution of stars in space to be consistent with his assumption of a constant stellar density .",
    "this value was amazingly close to the current estimates of @xmath2 .",
    "max wolf ( 1904 ) demonstrated the existence of discrete clouds of interstellar matter by comparing the star counts for regions containing obscuring matter with those for neighbouring undimmed regions . * in 1912 , vesto slipher discovered * reflection nebulae * from an analysis of the spectrum of the nebulosity in the pleiades cluster which he found was identical to that of the illuminating stars .",
    "it was later recognized that the nebulosity was created by the scattering of light from an intrinsically luminous star by the dust particles in the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "* henry n. russell ( 1922 ) argued that * dark clouds accounted for the obscuration and this obscuring matter had to be in the form of millimeter - sized fine dust*. anton pannekoek ( 1920 ) recognized that the obscuration can not be caused by the rayleigh scattering of gas , otherwise one would require unrealistically high masses for the dark nebulae .",
    "he also noticed that , as suggested by willem de sitter , the cloud mass problem can be vanished if the extinction is due to dust grains with a size comparable to the wavelength of visible light . * in 1922 , mary l. heger observed two broad absorption features at 5780@xmath3 and 5797@xmath3 , conspicuously broader than atomic interstellar absorption lines . the interstellar nature of these absorption features was established 12 years later by paul w. merrill ( 1934 ) .",
    "these mysterious lines  known as the * diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) * , still remain unidentified . * in 1930 , a real breakthrough was made by * robert j. trumpler who provided the first unambiguous evidence for interstellar absorption and reddening which led to the general establishment of the existence of interstellar dust*. trumpler ( 1930 ) based this on a comparison between the photometric distances and geometrical distances of 100 open clusters .",
    "if there was no interstellar absorption , the two distances should be in agreement .",
    "however , trumpler ( 1930 ) found that the photometric distances are systematically larger than the geometrical distances , indicating that the premise of a transparent ism was incorrect . using this direct and compelling method",
    "he was able to find both absorption and selective absorption or color excess with increasing distance.0.3@xmath4 between the photographic ( with an effective wavelength @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) and visual ( @xmath8@xmath6@xmath9 ) bands , and a general ( visual ) absorption of @xmath101.0@xmath4 . ] trumpler ( 1930 ) also concluded that * the observed color excess could only be accounted for by `` fine cosmic dust''*. * in 1932 , jan h. oort demonstrated that the space between the stars must contain a considerable amount of matter .",
    "he derived an * upper limit ( `` oort limit '' ) on the total mass of the matter ( including both stars and interstellar matter ) * in the solar neighbourhood from an analysis of the motions of k giants perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy ( the @xmath11-direction ) .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath10@xmath12 on the total mass density was obtained from measuring the gravitational acceleration in the @xmath11-direction .",
    "the oort limit has important implications : ( 1 ) * there has to be more material in the galactic plane than could be seen in stars * since the mass density of known stars is only @xmath10@xmath13 ; and ( 2 ) * the upper limit of @xmath10@xmath14 on the mass density of the interstellar matter in the solar neighbourhood places severe restrictions on the source of the obscuration * : what kind of material distributed with this density with what mass absorption coefficient could give rise to the observed visual extinction of about @xmath15 ?",
    "apparently , only with small dust grains could so much extinction by so little mass ( and the @xmath16 wavelength dependence ; see below ) be explained . * in 1936 , rudnick by the first time measured the wavelength dependence of extinction in the wavelength range 40006300@xmath3 based on differential spectrophotometric observations of reddened and unreddened stars of the same spectral type .",
    "rudnick ( 1936 ) found that the measured * extinction curve was inconsistent with rayleigh scattering * ( which has a @xmath17 wavelength dependence ) .",
    "this so - called `` * pair - match",
    "* '' method remains the most common way of deriving an interstellar extinction curve .",
    "* by the end of the 1930s , a * @xmath16 extinction law in the wavelength range 13@xmath18 * had been well established ( hall 1937 ; greenstein 1938 ; stebbins , huffer , & whitford 1939 ) , thanks to the advent of the photoelectric photometry , excluding free electrons , atoms , molecules , and solid grains much larger or much smaller than the wavelength of visible light , leaving solids with a size comparable to the wavelength as the sole possibility . * in 1936 , struve & elvey demonstrated the scattering of general starlight by interstellar clouds based on a series of observations of the dark cloud barnard  15 , the core of which is appreciably darker than the rim , although the latter is about opaque as the former .",
    "they attributed the increased brightness of the outer region to * interstellar scattering*. * in 1941 , henyey & greenstein confirmed the existence of * diffuse interstellar radiation * ( which was originally detected by van rhijn [ 1921 ] ) in the photographic wavelength region .",
    "they interpreted the observed intensity of diffuse light as scattered stellar radiation by * interstellar grains which are strongly forward scattering and have a high albedo ( higher than @xmath100.3)*. * in 1943 , with the advent of the six - colour photometry ( at 3530@xmath3@xmath19@xmath20@xmath1910300@xmath3 ) stebbins & whitford found that the extinction curve exhibits curvature at the near infrared ( ir ; @xmath21 m ) and ultraviolet ( uv ; @xmath22 m ) regions , * deviating from the simple @xmath16 law*. * in 1953 , morgan , harris , & johnson estimated the ratio of total visual extinction to color excess to be @xmath23 .",
    "this was supported by a more detailed study carried out by whitford ( 1958 ) , who argued that there appeared to be a `` very close approach to uniformity of the reddening law '' in most directions . *",
    "a uniform extinction curve with a constant @xmath24 * was welcomed by the astronomical community  at that early stage , interstellar dust was mainly regarded as an annoying mere extinguisher of starlight which prevented an accurate measurement of distances to stars .",
    "the proposal of `` a uniform extinction curve with a constant @xmath24 '' made it easier to correct photometric distances for the effects of absorption ( also because the determination of the color excess @xmath25 for early - type stars was relatively straightforward ) .",
    "* in 1955 , based on the ubv photometry of early o stars in a region in cygnus , johnson & morgan noted that there may exist * regional variations * in the interstellar extinction curve .",
    "the * nonuniformity nature of the interstellar extinction curve * was later confirmed in cygnus , orion , perseus , cepheus and ngc2244 by johnson & borgman ( 1963 ) , nandy ( 1964 ) , and johnson ( 1965 ) .",
    "those authors also found a wide variety of @xmath24 values ( ranging from @xmath103.0 to @xmath107.4 ) in different regions .",
    "wampler ( 1961 ) found a systematic variation with galactic longitude of @xmath26 , the ratio of slopes in the blue to those in the visible region .",
    "* in the 1960s and early 1970s , the extension of the extinction curve toward the middle and far uv ( @xmath16@xmath27@xmath28 ) was made possible by rocket and satellite observations , including the rocket - based photoelectric photometry at @xmath29 and 2200@xmath3 ( boggess & borgman 1964 ) ; the _ aerobee _ rocket spectrophotometry at 1200@xmath3@xmath30@xmath20@xmath303000@xmath3 ( stecher 1965 ) ; the _ orbiting astronomical satellite _ ( oao-2 ) spectrophotometry at 1100@xmath3@xmath30@xmath20@xmath30@xmath31 ( bless & savage 1972 ) ; and the _ copernicus _ satellite spectrophotometry at 1000@xmath3@xmath30@xmath20@xmath30@xmath32 ( york et al .",
    "* by 1973 , the interstellar extinction curve had been determined over the whole wavelength range from 0.2@xmath33 to 10@xmath33*. * in 1965 , the * 2175@xmath3 extinction bump was detected * by stecher ( 1965 ) . shortly after its detection",
    ", it was attributed to graphite ( stecher & donn 1965 ) .",
    "it was later found that the strength and width of this bump vary with environment while its peak position is quite invariant .",
    "* cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) found that the optical / uv extinction curve in the wavelength range of 0.125@xmath34@xmath20@xmath34@xmath35 which shows considerable regional variations can be approximated by an analytical formula involving only one free parameter : the total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath36@xmath37@xmath24 , whereas the near - ir extinction curve ( 0.9@xmath38@xmath34@xmath20@xmath34@xmath35 ) can be fitted reasonably well by a power law @xmath39@xmath40@xmath41 , showing little environmental variations .",

    "( 2005 ) found that the ccm prediction for short - wavelengths ( @xmath42 ) is not valid for all sightlines . ]",
    "+   + * in the 1930s , small * metallic particles * were proposed to be responsible for the interstellar extinction , partly because meteoritic particles ( predominantly metallic ) and interstellar grains were then thought to have the same origin .",
    "reasonably good fits to the @xmath16 extinction law were obtained in terms of small metallic grains with a dominant size of @xmath100.05@xmath38 ( schaln 1936 ) or a power - law size distribution @xmath43@xmath10@xmath44 in the size range @xmath45@xmath30@xmath46@xmath30@xmath47 ( greenstein 1938 ) . * in 1935 , based on the correlation between gas concentration and extinction , bertil lindblad suggested that * interstellar grains were formed by condensation from the interstellar gas through random accretion of gas atoms * , as speculated by sir arthur eddington ( 1926 ) that it was so cold in space that virtually all gaseous atoms and ions which hit a solid particle would freeze down upon it.5@xmath48 .",
    "] however , it was found later that in typical interstellar conditions , the lindblad condensation theory would result in a complete disappearance of all condensable gases and the grains would grow to sizes ( @xmath1010@xmath38 ) well beyond those which could account for the interstellar extinction . * in 1946 , by introducing a grain destruction process caused by grain - grain collisions as a consequence of interstellar cloud encounters , jan h. oort and hendrik c. van de hulst further developed the interstellar condensation theory and led to the * `` dirty ice '' model consisting of saturated molecules * such as h@xmath49o , ch@xmath50 , and nh@xmath51 with an equilibrium size distribution which could be roughly approximated by a functional form @xmath52@xmath10@xmath53 $ ] and an average size of @xmath100.15@xmath38 .",
    "what might be the condensation nulcei was unclear at that time . * in 1946 , van de hulst by the first time made * realistic estimations of 1020@xmath48 for grain temperatures*. before that , it was long thought that they had a black - body temperature of @xmath103.2@xmath48 ( eddington 1926 ) .",
    "van de hulst ( 1946 ) noted that interstellar grains are much warmer than a 3.2@xmath48 black - body because they do not radiate effectively at long wavelengths . * in 1949 , hall and hiltner independently discovered the general * interstellar linear polarization * by incident  their original objective was to look for intrinsic stellar polarization from eclipsing binaries .",
    "the interstellar origin of this polarization was indicated by the correlation of the degree of polarization with reddening and the fact that the direction of polarization is generally parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "the interstellar polarization was attributed to the * differential extinction of starlight by nonspherical grains aligned to a small degree with respect to the galactic plane*. * in 1951 , davis & greenstein suggested that interstellar grains could be aligned with respect to the interstellar magnetic field by the paramagnetic relaxation mechanism . * the variation of interstellar polarization with wavelength was first revealed by behr ( 1959 ) and gehrels ( 1960 ) .",
    "it was later shown that the * wavelength dependence of polarization * is well approximated by an empirical formula , often known as the * serkowski law * ( serkowski 1973 ; coyne , gehrels , & serkowski 1974 ; wilking et al .",
    "1980).=@xmath54 $ ] is determined by only one parameter : @xmath55  the wavelength where the maximum polarization @xmath56 occurs ; the width parameter @xmath57 is related to @xmath55 through @xmath57@xmath6@xmath58 + 0.01 .",
    "the peak wavelength @xmath55 is indicative of grain size and correlated with @xmath36 : @xmath59 ( @xmath55 is in micron ; see whittet 2003 ) . ] but the near - ir ( 1.64@xmath38@xmath19@xmath20@xmath19@xmath60 ) polarization is better approximated by a power law @xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 , with @xmath64@xmath65@xmath66 , independent of @xmath67 ( martin & whittet 1990 , martin et al .",
    "1992 ) . * in 1972 , the interstellar * circular polarization * which arises from the interstellar birefringence ( martin 1972 ) as originally predicted by van de hulst ( 1957 ) , was first detected along the lines of sight to the crab nebula by martin , illing , & angel ( 1972 ) and to six early - type stars by kemp & wolstencroft ( 1972 ) . * in early 1950s  soon after the discovery of interstellar polarization , the validity of the ice model seemed doubtful since * ice grains are an inefficient polarizer * , and therefore it would be difficult for them to explain the observed rather high degree of polarization relative to extinction ( van de hulst 1950 ; spitzer & tukey 1951 ; cayrel & schatzman 1954 ) . * in 1954 , cayrel & schatzman suggested that * graphite grains * , comprising a small component of the total mass of interstellar dust , could account for the observed polarization - to - extinction ratio because of their strong optical anisotropy . * in 1962 , hoyle & wickramasinghe proposed that * graphite grains of sizes a few times 0.01@xmath38 could condense in the atmospheres of cool n - type carbon stars * , and these grains will subsequently be driven out of the stellar atmospheres and * injected into interstellar space * by the stellar radiation pressure .",
