    "the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) is probably one of the most important operators in modern science .",
    "it is omnipresent in various fields of discrete mathematics and engineering , including combinatorics , number theory , computer science and , last but probably not least , digital signal processing . formally , the dft is a family @xmath4 of unitary operators , where each @xmath5 acts on the hilbert space @xmath6 by the formula    @xmath7 \\left ( w\\right ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum \\limits_{t\\in % tcimacro{\\u{2124 } } % % beginexpansion \\mathbb{z } % endexpansion /n%",
    "% tcimacro{\\u{2124 } } % % beginexpansion \\mathbb{z } % endexpansion } e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{n}wt}f\\left ( t\\right ) .\\ ] ]    although , so widely used , the spectral properties of the dft remains to some extent still mysterious .",
    "for example , the calculation of the multiplicities of its eigenvalues , which was first carried out by gauss , is quite involved and requires a multiple of number theoretic manipulations @xcite .",
    "a primary motivation for studying the eigenvectors of the dft comes from digital signal processing . here",
    ", a function is considered in two basic realizations : the time realization and the frequency realization .",
    "each realization , yields information on different attributes of the function .",
    "the dft operator acts as a dictionary between these two realizations @xmath8    from this point of view , it is natural to look for a diagonalization basis , namely , a basis of eigenvectors ( eigen modes ) for @xmath5 . in this regard ,",
    "the main conceptual difficulty comes from the fact that the diagonalization problem is ill - defined , since , @xmath5 is an operator of order 4 , i.e. , @xmath9 , which means that it has at most four eigenvalues @xmath10,@xmath11 , therefore each appears with large multiplicity ( we assume @xmath12 ) .",
    "an interesting approach to the resolution of this difficulty , motivated from results in continuous fourier analysis , was developed by grnbaum in g. in that approach , a tridiagonal operator @xmath13 which commutes with @xmath14 and admits a simple spectrum is introduced .",
    "this enable him to give a basis of eigenfunctions for the dft .",
    "specifically , @xmath13 appears as a certain discrete analogue of the differential operator @xmath15 which commutes with the continuous fourier transform .      in this paper",
    "we describe a representation theoretic approach to the diagonalization problem of the dft in the case when @xmath1 is an odd prime number .",
    "our approach , puts to the forefront the weil representation @xcite of the finite symplectic group @xmath16 as the fundamental object underlying harmonic analysis in the finite setting .",
    "specifically , we exhibit a canonical basis @xmath17 of eigenvectors for the dft .",
    "we also describe the transition matrix @xmath18 from the standard basis to @xmath17 , which we call the _ discrete oscillator transform _ ( dot for short ) .",
    "in addition , in the case @xmath19mod @xmath20 , we describe a fast algorithm for computing @xmath18 ( fot for short ) .",
    "it is our general feeling that the weil representation yields a transparent explanation to many classical results in finite harmonic analysis . to justify this claim ,",
    "we describe an alternative method for calculating the multiplicities of the eigenvalues for the dft , a method we believe is more suggestive then the classical calculations .",
    "the rest of the introduction is devoted to a more detailed account of the main ideas and results of this paper .",
    "let us fix an odd prime number @xmath21 and for the rest of the introduction suppress the subscript @xmath21 from all notations . generally , when a ( diagonalizable ) linear operator @xmath22 has eigenvalues admitting large multiplicities , it suggest that there exists a group @xmath23 of `` hidden '' symmetries consisting of operators which commute with @xmath22 .  alas ,",
    "usually the problem of computing the group @xmath24 is formidable and , in fact , equivalent to the problem of diagonalizing @xmath22 .",
    "if the operator @xmath22  arise `` naturally '' , there is a chance that the group @xmath24 can be effectively described . in preferred situations , @xmath24 is commutative and large enough so that all degeneracies are resolved and the spaces of common eigenvectors with respect to @xmath24 are one - dimensional .",
    "the basis of common eigenvectors with respect to @xmath24 establishes a distinguish choice of eigenvectors for @xmath22 .",
    "philosophically , we can say that it  is more correct to consider from start the group @xmath24 instead of the single operator @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , the dft operator @xmath25 admits a natural group of symmetries @xmath26 , which , in addition , can be effectively described using the weil representation . for the sake of the introduction",
    ", it is enough to know that the weil representation in this setting is a unitary representation @xmath27 and the key observation is that @xmath28 is proportional to a single operator @xmath29 the group @xmath26 is the image under @xmath30 of the centralizer subgroup @xmath31 of in @xmath32      the subgroup @xmath31 can be computed explicitly and is of a very `` nice '' type , it consists of rational points of a maximal algebraic torus in @xmath33 which in plain language means that it is maximal commutative subgroup in @xmath34 , consisting of elements which are diagonalizable over some field extension . restricting the weil representation to the subgroup @xmath35 yields a collection @xmath36 of commuting operators , each acts unitarily on the hilbert space @xmath37 and commutes with @xmath28 .",
    "this , in turn , yields a decomposition , stable under fourier transform , into character spaces    @xmath38    where @xmath39 runs in the set of ( complex valued ) characters of @xmath40 , namely , if @xmath41 then @xmath42 . the main technical statement of this paper , theorem 3 , roughly says that @xmath43 for every @xmath39 which appears in ( [ dec1_eq ] ) . choosing a unit representative @xmath44 for every @xmath39 ,",
    "gives the canonical basis @xmath45 of eigenvectors for @xmath28 .",
    "the oscillator transform @xmath46 sends a function @xmath47 to the coefficients in the unique expansion @xmath48 the fine behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath46 is governed by the  ( split type ) structure of @xmath31 , which changes depending on the value of the prime @xmath21 modulo @xmath49 .",
    "this phenomena has several consequences .",
    "in particular , it gives a transparent explanation to the precise way the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of @xmath28 depend on the prime @xmath21 .",
    "another , algorithmic , consequence is related to the existence of a fast algorithm for computing @xmath50 .",
    "the character vectors @xmath51 satisfy many interesting properties and are objects of study in their own right . a comprehensive treatment of this aspect of the theory appears in @xcite .",
    "all the results in this paper were stated for the basic finite field @xmath52 , for the reason of making the terminology more accessible .",
    "in fact , all the results can be stated and proved for any field extension of the form @xmath53 , @xmath54 . in most places",
    "one should only need to replace @xmath21 by @xmath55 .",
    "we begin by discussing the finite heisenberg group and the heisenberg representation .",
    "next we introduce the weil representation of the finite symplectic group , first it is described in abstract terms and then more explicitly invoking the idea of invariant presentation of an operator .",
    "we proceed to discuss the theory of tori in the one - dimensional weil representation , we explain how to associate to a maximal torus @xmath56 , a transform @xmath57 called the oscillator transform . we describe a fast algorithm for computing @xmath58 in the case @xmath59 is a split torus . the theory is then applied to the specific torus associated with the dft operator .",
    "we finish with a treatment of the multiplicity problem for the dft , from the representation theoretic perspective .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank j. bernstein for his interest and guidance .",
    "we acknowledge r. howe for sharing with us some unpublished results of his .",
    "we appreciate several discussions we had with a. grnbaum , w. kahan , b. parlett , b. porat , a. sahai on the dft .",

    "finally , we thank p. diaconis , k. ribet , b. poonen , m. haiman and m. gu for the opportunities to present this work in the msri , number theory , representation theory and scientific computing seminars at berkeley during february 2008 .",
