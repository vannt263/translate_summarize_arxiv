    "technological advances in telescope and instrument design during the last ten years , coupled with the exponential increase in computer and communications capability , have caused a _",
    "dramatic and irreversible change in the character of astronomical research .",
    "_ large scale surveys of the sky from space and ground are being initiated at wavelengths from radio to x - ray , thereby generating vast amounts of high quality irreplaceable data .",
    "_ the potential for scientific discovery afforded by these new surveys is enormous .",
    "_ entirely new and unexpected scientific results of major significance will emerge from the combined use of the resulting datasets , science that would not be possible from such sets used singly . however , their large size and complexity require tools and structures to discover the complex phenomena encoded within them .",
    "we propose establishing a * national virtual observatory * that can meet these needs through the coordination of diverse efforts already in existence as well as providing focus for the development of capabilities that do not yet exist .",
    "the nvo will act as an enabling and coordinating entity to foster the development of tools , protocols , and collaborations necessary to realize the full scientific potential of astronomical databases in the coming decade .",
    "when fully implemented , the nvo will serve as _ an engine of discovery for astronomy .",
    "_    the new scientific capabilities that will be enabled by the nvo are essential to realize the full value of the terabyte and petabyte datasets that are in hand or soon to be created .",
    "rapid querying of large scale catalogs , establishment of statistical correlations , discovery of new data patterns and temporal variations , and confrontation with sophisticated numerical simulations are all avenues for new science that will be made possible through the nvo . in addition , the nvo and its data archives will require _ collaborations with the computer science community , _ will provide opportunity for collaboration with other disciplines facing similar challenges , and will be _ a venue for educational outreach . _",
    "three examples of scientific programs involving active galactic nuclei , the large scale structure of the universe , and the structure of our galaxy illustrate the scientific promise of the nvo .",
    "_ the nvo will be technology - enabled , but science - driven .",
    "_    implementation of the nvo involves significant technical challenges .",
    "these include both the incorporation of existing data archiving efforts in astronomy as well as the development of new capabilities and structures .",
    "major technical components to the nvo include archives , metadata standards , a data access layer , query and computing services , and data mining applications .",
    "development of these capabilities will require close interaction and collaboration with the information technology community .",
    "the implementation plan for the nvo is defined by four phases , beginning with activities initiated prior to the establishment of the nvo and leading to the fully operational phase of the nvo four  five years after its inception .",
    "this implementation plan is designed to begin placement of deliverables and capability to the community at the earliest possible time .",
    "this early functionality is essential to the success of the nvo .",
    "for over two hundred years , the usual mode of carrying out astronomical research has been that of a single astronomer or small group of astronomers performing observations of a small number of objects . in the past",
    ", entire careers have been spent in the acquisition of enough data to barely enable statistically significant conclusions to be drawn . moreover , because observing time with the most powerful facilities is very limited , many astrophysical questions that require a large amount of data for their resolution simply could not be addressed .",
    "this approach is now undergoing a dramatic and very rapid change .",
    "the transformation is being driven by technological developments over the last decade that are without precedent .",
    "the major areas of change upon which this revolution in astronomy rests are advances in telescope design and fabrication , the development of large scale detector arrays , the exponential growth of computing capability , and the ever expanding coverage and capacity of communications networks .    the advances in telescope design and fabrication have made possible the great space based observatories , opening new vistas in gamma ray , x - ray , optical and infrared astronomy .",
    "advanced technology has also made possible the establishment of a new generation of large aperture ground based optical and ir telescopes as well as the design and construction of single dish and multi element arrays operating at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths . at optical and infrared wavelengths these advances",
    "have been coupled with the development of extremely sensitive , high resolution detector arrays of ever increasing size , and the ability to mosaic these arrays has resulted in instruments with fields of view of order 30 arcminutes and with @xmath0 pixels per image .",
    "these technical developments continue to mature , with more sophisticated and larger aperture telescopes being planned in space and on the ground , using ever larger and more capable arrays of detectors incorporated into advanced instrumentation .",
    "just as moore s law reflects the exponential increase in computing capability with time , the technological developments in observational astronomy over the last decade have in effect introduced _ a moore s law for astronomy as well .",
    "_    the emergence of more astronomical facilities , on the ground and in space , with larger apertures and more sophisticated instrumentation , will have a critical and inevitable consequence : an enormously increased flow of data .",
    "for example , the current data production rate of hst is about 5 gigabytes per day ; but a facility recently recommended for construction by the aasc decadal survey  the large - aperture synoptic survey telescope  could produce up to 10 terabytes per day !",
    "in addition to this increased data rate , _ the manner in which observations are being made is also changing . _",
    "although the new observatories in space and on the ground still devote a significant fraction of their time to research in the `` single observer / single program '' mode where small blocks of time are allocated to many specifically targeted research programs , more time is now being devoted to large scale surveys of the sky , often at multiple wavelengths , that involve large numbers of collaborators .",
    "these large survey programs will produce coherent blocks of data obtained with uniform standards , and with the amount of data often measured in terabytes .",
    "this _ paradigm shift _ has been made possible not only by the increased capabilities of the new facilities that permit much faster acquisition of data , but also by the availability of computational hardware and software that make it possible to acquire , reduce , and archive this data .",
    "a major technological development that will change the character of astronomical research is the advent of high speed information transfer networks with broad coverage . although the rapid transfer of large amounts of data over common networks is currently unacceptably slow ( over 20 _ days _ to transfer a 1 terabyte data set ) , future networks will be much faster .",
    "the availability of these data rates , together with the high efficiency of data acquisition at both ground and space based facilities , will make possible the efficient transmission of large amounts of data to many different sites .",
    "this technology will also enable access to specific subsets of data by an extensive user community that prior to this had no readily available access to these data ; the potential scientific yield resulting from this accessibility will be enormous .",
    "it is clear that all of these technological drivers will result in _ an unprecedented flow of astronomical data _ in the coming years .",
    "moreover , _",
    "these data sets will be very different , _ in that most of them will be in the form of coherent surveys , often at multiple wavelengths , over significant portions of the sky .",
    "hence they will have _ a richness and depth that is unprecedented , _ and they will present unique opportunities for application to a variety of scientific programs by a wide range of users . this aspect alone makes the systematic archiving of these data essential .",
    "in addition , the data will be obtained through use of costly state of the art facilities that will be highly oversubscribed , and this will essentially preclude repetitions of observations previously made ; this also argues for a general archiving of these data .",
    "the existence of such archives , containing multiwavelength data on hundreds of millions of objects , will clearly create a demand within the astronomical community for access to the archives and for the tools necessary to analyze the data they contain .",
    "opportunities for data mining , for sophisticated pattern recognition , for large scale statistical cross correlations , and for the discovery of rare objects and temporal variations all become apparent .    in addition , for the first time in the history of astronomy , such data sets will allow meaningful comparisons to be made between sophisticated numerical simulations and statistically complete multivariate bodies of data . the rapid growth of high speed and widely distributed networks",
    "means that all of these scientific endeavors will be made available to the community of astronomers throughout the us and in other countries .",
    "these technological developments have converged in the last few years , and they will _ completely alter the manner in which most observational astronomy is carried out . _ these changes are inevitable and irreversible , and they will have dramatic effects on the sociology of astronomy itself . moreover , there is a growing awareness , both in this country and abroad , that the acquisition , organization , analysis and dissemination of scientific data are essential elements to _ a continuing robust growth of science and technology . _",
    "these factors make it imperative to provide a structure that will enable the most efficient and effective synthesis of these technological capabilities .",
    "hence there is a need now for an entity such as a national virtual observatory to oversee the rational disposition of the growing body of astronomical data .",
    "the nvo is an entity that will enable advances in astronomy and astrophysics previously unattainable .",
    "it will be a key ingredient in establishing a new age of discovery in astronomy . with its conjugation of terabyte data archives , image libraries of millions of objects at wavelengths from gamma rays to radio frequencies , sophisticated data mining and analysis tools , access to terascale supercomputing facilities with petabyte storage capacities , and very high speed connectivity among major astronomical centers",
    ", the nvo will be unique .",
    "it will make possible rapid querying of individual terabyte archives by thousands of researchers , enable visualization of multivariate patterns embedded in large catalog and image databases , enhance discovery of complex patterns or rare phenomena , encourage real time collaborations among multiple research groups , and allow large statistical studies that will for the first time permit confrontation between databases and sophisticated numerical simulations .",
    "it will facilitate our understanding of many of the astrophysical processes that determine the evolution of the universe .",
    "it will enable new science , better science , and more cost effective science .",
    "the nvo will act as a coordinating and enabling entity to foster the development of tools , protocols , and collaborations necessary to realize the full scientific potential of astronomical databases in the coming decade .",
    "_ it will be an engine of discovery for astronomy_.    to accomplish this , the nvo will first and foremost be built as a science driven , community effort with a major fraction of the funding disbursed via a peer review process .",
    "this would be accomplished through regular announcements of opportunity for both software projects that develop nvo infrastructure and for science activities that utilize the nvo . more specifically , nvo activities to fulfill its role would include :    * establishment of a common systems approach to data pipelining , archiving and retrieval that will ensure easy access by a large and diverse community of users and that will minimize costs and times to completion ; * enabling the distributed development of a suite of commonly usable new software tools to make possible the querying , correlation , visualization and statistical comparisons described above ; * coordinating the establishment of high speed data transfer networks that are essential to providing the connectivity among archives , terascale computing facilities , and the widespread community of users ; * facilitating productive collaborations among astronomy centers and major academic institutions , both national and international , in order to maximize productivity and minimize infrastructure costs ; * ensuring communication and possible collaborations with scientists in other disciplines facing similar problems , and with the private sector ; * maintaining a continuing program of public and educational outreach that capitalizes upon the unique resources , in both data and software , of the nvo to provide a unique window into astronomy and scientific methodology .",
    "the nvo will be a unique entity , primarily because its operation will be distributed and will be based upon rapidly developing technologies in communication and computer science . in order to ensure its continuing vitality",
    ", the nvo must embrace several major themes .",
    "* the nvo must be * evolutionary*. from its inception , this evolutionary nature and will enable the nvo to respond quickly to changing technical and scientific opportunities and community requirements .",
    "because of the continuing evolution in technical capabilities , this evolutionary nature will be an integral part of the nvo throughout its existence .",
    "an immediate consequence of this agility is the need for a management structure that both manages the distributed development efforts of the nvo and that moves quickly to exploit new possibilities .",
    "management and oversight must be effective , efficient , visionary , and accountable to the community , yet minimize overhead and inertia .",
    "* the nvo must be * distributed * in nature .",
    "significant amounts of expertise are already in place at existing centers , and full advantage will be taken of this from the outset .",
    "in addition , the most economical and effective progress toward the goals of the nvo may well be realized in its operational phase through a distributed approach .",
    "this would entail location at existing centers and at future data centers those key areas of nvo functions that are most effectively carried out at those centers .",
    "* the nvo must be * integrated*. complementary to its distributed structure will be an enduring theme of integration as the nvo evolves . in order for the nvo to be most effective in facilitating scientific advances , the information technology functions must be integrated over all wavelengths and over space based and ground based facilities .",
    "in addition , integration with developments in computer science and information technology will be an essential element of the nvo .",
    "* the nvo must provide * outreach*. the vast datasets and the accompanying analysis tools that will be available through the nvo provide an opportunity for educational and public outreach on a level that has not been possible in the past . an active outreach program that takes full advantage of the educational potential of the nvo resources",
    "must be implemented at all stages of the nvo development .",
    "* the nvo must be * globally oriented*. a continuing aspect of the nvo will be its international links to similar efforts in other countries . though it will not initially be an international collaboration itself ,",
    "it is clear that the nvo must maintain communication , and collaborations when appropriate , at all levels with these other activities .",
    "it seems inevitable that nvo engendered activities will become a worldwide phenomenon .",
    "* the nvo must * provide a path to the future*. the vision of nvo described here is primarily that of a catalytic and enabling entity , with minimal structure and enormous connectivity",
    ". a direct product of this will be the enhancement of scientific productivity in astronomy to new levels .",
    "however , a larger and perhaps more enduring legacy of the nvo will be its role in the establishment of an * astronomy information infrastructure * within the us and throughout the world .",
    "the growth of this infrastructure , expedited by the nvo , will provide unprecedented new vistas and opportunities for astronomical research in the future .",
    "as we look ahead , the astronomical community stands poised to take advantage of the breathtaking advances in computational speed , storage media and detector technology in two ways : ( 1 ) by carrying out new generation surveys spanning a wide range of wavelengths and optimized to exploit these advances fully ; and ( 2 ) by developing the software tools to enable discovery of new patterns in the multi - terabyte ( and later petabyte ) databases that represent the legacies of these surveys . in combination , new generation surveys and software tools can provide the basis for enabling science of a qualitatively different nature .",
    "moreover , _ the inherent richness of these databases promises scientific returns reaching far beyond the primary objectives of the survey : _ for example , repeated imaging surveys aimed at developing a census of kuiper belt objects can provide the basis for discovering supernovae at @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the multiplier effects of survey databases are enormous as exemplified by the world - wide explosion of research ignited by the hubble deep field",
    ".    we now have the tools to carry out surveys over nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum on a variety of spatial scales and over multiple epochs , all with well - defined selection criteria and well - understood limits . the ability to create panchromatic images , and in some cases digital movies of the universe , provide _ unprecedented opportunities for discovering new phenomena and patterns that can fundamentally alter our understanding . _ in the past , a panchromatic view of the same region of sky at optical and radio wavelengths led to the discovery of quasars .",
    "the availability of infrared data led to the discovery of obscured active galactic nuclei and star - forming regions unsuspected from visible images .",
    "repeated images of the sky have led to the discovery of transient phenomena  supernovae , and more recently , micro - lensing events  as well as deeper understanding of synoptic phenomena .",
    "the joining together of various large scale digital surveys will make possible new explorations of parameter space , such as the low surface brightness universe at all wavelengths .    _",
    "the challenges of discovering new patterns and phenomena in huge astronomical databases find parallels in the medical , biological and earth sciences_. for example , the size of the human genome is roughly 3 gb , while a digital all sky survey will be about 10 tb in size .",
    "the development of tools and techniques to handle astronomical datasets of this size will clearly have to call upon new developments in computer science and will , when developed , have applications to fields outside astronomy . in all cases ,",
    "the full power of these databases can not be tapped without the development of new tools and new institutional structures that can consolidate disparate databases and catalogs , enable access to them , and place analysis tools in the hands of a broad community of imaginative scientists .",
    "it is this vision that motivates the creation of the nvo .",
    "the major capabilities of the nvo that need to be established in order to enable its scientific goals include the ability to :    * federate existing large databases at multiple wavelengths and create tools to query them in both the catalog and the pixel domain ; * develop universal standards for archiving future large databases ; * provide a framework for incorporating new databases , thus minimizing the cost of new surveys and experiments and maximizing their scientific return ; * develop analysis tools for discovery in catalog datasets and for statistical analysis of resulting joint datasets ; * develop tools for object classification in the image datasets ; * develop tools for visualization in both catalog and image databases ; * develop new approaches to querying image databases and for image analysis and pattern recognition ; * incorporate the results of sophisticated numerical simulations and develop a statistical `` toolbox '' for confronting these simulations with data ; and * link with existing and future digital libraries and journals .",
    "all of the above are possible , and all are qualitatively different from what we now do because of size , dimensionality , and complexity . over time , the nvo can evolve to carry out all these functions .",
    "however , while enabled by technology , the nvo is not driven by technology . instead , its structure and evolution are fundamentally driven by science and the needs of the scientific community . a major tool for guiding decisions about developing an nvo capability and the pace of implementing these capabilities will be that of a community - developed `` science reference mission '' ( srm ) for nvo .",
    "we envision a structured process to develop the srm for nvo comprising :    * a broad community discussion at a workshop to be held in pasadena during 1316 june , 2000 ; * discussion among multiple community working groups identified at the pasadena workshop and charged with developing : 1 .",
    "the details of a major scientific program enabled by the technical possibilities outlined above ; 2 .",
    "an explanation of the scientific merit of the program as well as a discussion of the difficulty of accomplishing the same result without the nvo ; 3 .",
    "an understanding of the flowdown from the needs of the science program to archive , archive access , and software tool requirements ; and 4 .",
    "prioritization of requirements . * a meeting among the chairs of the community working groups and the interim nvo steering committee to combine the input from the working groups into a coherent srm , complete with a science - to - requirements flowdown for nvo .    in preparation for this process",
    ", we have developed a few examples of science programs that give both a sense of the possibilities for discovery enabled by the nvo and of the initial basis for defining a framework and cadence for their implementation .",
    "we caution that these examples are as yet incomplete , and that they will require substantial community effort and input to convincingly demonstrate the potential power of the nvo and its required functions . in the material presented here , we emphasize the flowdown from science to capabilities because we believe that this step is necessary to understand how a complete description of the nvo will be obtained .",
    "* example # 1 : a panchromatic census of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) *    _ background : _ an understanding of the nature and characteristics of agn is important both because their luminosities make them visible to large cosmological distances , and because they represent a fundamental stage in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "observationally , agn are distinguishable from stars in that their spectral energy distributions are much broader than black - body functions .",
    "however , redshift , variability , ( possibly large ) obscuration , and a range of intrinsic spectral shapes and characteristics result in a great range of `` colors '' over wavelength ranges from x - ray to radio .    _",
    "scientific goals : _ this project aims to construct a complete sample of agn in order to :    * test the idea that observable properties are determined by extrinsic factors such as orientation or obscuration ( so - called unification models ) . *",

    "* understand the evolution of the agn luminosity function , and , in particular , separate number evolution from luminosity evolution . *",
    "construct the agn luminosity function for different wavelengths in order to understand the evolution of agn properties in a statistical sense .",

    "note that confirmation may require new observations the process might be carried out as a statistical one , resulting in a probability that any particular object is an agn .",
    "use catalog properties and/or further measurements from image databases to address science questions .",
    "_ nvo functionality required : _    * federation of relevant surveys including cross - identification of objects in multi - wavelength surveys and interchange / merging of metadata . * cluster analysis to identify `` clouds '' and `` sequences '' .",

    "these models can be tested by comparing their predictions with observed mass and luminosity functions of clusters .",
    "_ scientific goals : _ this project aims to construct an unbiased sample of clusters of galaxies over a cosmologically significant redshift range in order to test various structure formation and evolution models by comparison with evolution of the observed mass and luminosity functions with redshift .",

    "these are the fossil tracers of the formation processes .",

    "we emphasize again that these projects are meant to be illustrative of the kind of science , previously very difficult , that could be accomplished using capabilities that we foresee for the nvo .",
    "as the nvo comes into being , it is clear that more highly defined and diverse sets of projects will be developed as a result of community input and discussion .",
    "in assessing the current state of north american astronomy , the following resources are already in place to support the emerging nvo :    * _ data centers and supercomputer centers . _",
    "some tens of terabytes of data products ( catalogs , images , and spectra ) already exist for various space missions , public telescopes , and surveys ; this will expand to a petabyte or more of data by the end of the decade .",
    "archive and data analysis capabilities exist at the major nasa centers ( stsci , ipac , heasarc , and cxc ) and at the cadc ( canada ) ; many smaller or more focused archives exist as well .",
    "supercomputer centers such as the sdsc and ncsa are available for addressing large scale computational problems .",
    "a high performance national networking infrastructure is already in place . *",
    "_ astronomical information services .",
    "_ information services such as the ads , ned , and simbad exist for name resolution and cross - referencing of galactic and extragalactic objects , and are providing increasingly sophisticated levels of interlinking between bibliographic information , the refereed and preprint literature , and the archival data centers . * _ data analysis software . _ various software packages such as aips , aips++ , iraf , idl , ftools , skyview , _ etc . _  , exist for the general analysis of astronomical data .",
    "the development of sophisticated software for large scale data mining is still in its infancy , although new initiatives such as the npaci - sponsored digital sky and the ipac infrared science archive are showing the potential of such facilities and have prototyped the technology required to correlate and mine such data archives .",
    "although these resources are significant , anyone who has tried to perform multiwavelength data analysis or large scale statistical studies combining several different catalogs , with the data involved being available from widely distributed and dissimilar archives , will appreciate how far we have to go to implement the vision of the nvo .",
    "ground - based o / ir and radio data need to be pipeline - processed and archived routinely as space - based data are now .",
    "standards and protocols need to be developed to allow widely distributed archives to interoperate and exchange data .",
    "astronomical data analysis software needs to evolve to be able to access data in distributed multiwavelength archives as easily as local datasets are accessed now .",
    "new algorithms , applications , and toolkits need to be developed to mine multi - terabyte data archives .",
    "supercomputer - class computational systems need to be developed to enable large scale statistical studies of massive , multiwavelength distributed data archives .",
    "the data , software , and computational resources need to be interconnected at the highest available network bandwidths .",
    "any consideration of the science to be performed by the nvo , or the technical issues involved in implementing the nvo , must start with the _",
    "data_. although the data from most nasa missions have been routinely archived for over a decade , relatively little data from ground based telescopes is currently available online , other than for a few major surveys . with modern wide - field and multispectra instruments on ground - based telescopes producing ever larger quantities of data , and with ground - based survey projects becoming almost as common as classical observing ,",
    "_ there is an acute need to archive and publish high quality datasets from ground - based instruments and surveys_. the science promised by the nvo will not be possible unless the nvo succeeds in creating true , panchromatic images and catalogs , seamlessly integrating data from both ground- and space - based archives , and thereby enabling exploration of astrophysical phenomena over most of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "experience over the past decade has shown that astronomical archives are complex and diverse , never stop growing , and are best maintained by those close to the data who know it well . in practice",
    "this has meant that most data are put online either by individual large survey projects , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) or the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , or by discipline specific archive centers which serve a given community . to address the need to move to large scale archiving of ground - based astronomical data , archiving facilities will need to be established at the national centers ( noao , nrao , nso , naic ) , and partnerships will need to be formed with the major private and university - operated facilities .",
    "the major national data centers for ground- and space - based data will comprise the principle nodes of the distributed nvo data system in the u.s .",
    "given archival quality data from all branches of astronomy , physically distributed at 1020 major archive centers and any number of ancillary datasets together with a distributed community of thousands of scientific users , one can define what new software and services will be required to implement the nvo .",
    "analysis of the data will be complex , due to the heterogeneous nature of datasets from the different branches of astronomy and due to the use of increasingly complex data structures ( within the general framework of the fits data format standard ) to accommodate the increasing levels of sophistication of modern astronomical instrumentation .",
    "the sheer scale of the problem is daunting , with catalog sizes approaching the terabyte range and the total data volume in the petabyte range .",
    "however , an _ even more serious challenge comes from the complexity of these datasets , _ with tens or hundreds of attributes being measured for each of ten million or more objects .",
    "this is _ a crucial new aspect to the data mining issue , _ and multivariate correlation of such large catalogs is a massive computational problem .",
    "if pixel level analysis of candidate objects is required the computational problem can be even more massive .",
    "it is important to recognize that current brute - force analysis techniques do not scale to problems of this size !",
    "multidisciplinary research in areas such as metadata representation and handling , large scale statistical analysis and correlations , and distributed parallel computational techniques will be required to address the unprecedented data access and computational problems faced by the nvo .    fortunately , astronomy is not alone in facing this problem . _",
    "the technological challenges for the nvo are similar to those facing other branches of science , _ such as high energy physics , computational genomics , global climate studies , and oceanography .",
    "research and development of information systems technology is already underway in areas such as statistical analysis and data mining of large archives , distributed computational grids , data intensive grid computing ( data grids ) , and management of structured digital information ( digital libraries ) .",
    "much of this research is relevant to the problems faced by the nvo .",
    "information technology and data management throughout the sciences will both advance , and be advanced by , the nvo .",
    "the large dataset size and geographic distribution of users and resources also presents major challenges in connectivity .",
    "next generation networking providing cross - continental bandwidths of 100 mb / sec is now available and currently underutilized , but this situation will change rapidly",
    ". it will be essential for the major nvo data centers to be interconnected with very high speed networks , and to utilize intelligent server - side software agents in order to make the most efficient use of the network when interacting with end - users .",
    "the technical challenge of implementing the nvo is a study in contrasts .",
    "while data will be widely distributed , the large studies at the cutting edge of the science to be enabled by the nvo will need massive computational resources and fast local access to data .",
    "while sophisticated metadata standards and access protocols will be required to link together distributed archives and network services , the effort required to interface a small archive to the nvo must be minimized to encourage publication of new data collections by the community .",
    "while data collections and compute services will be widely distributed , users will need a straightforward interface to the system which makes the location and storage representation of data and services as transparent as possible .    to meet this wide range of requirements",
    ", the nvo needs a distributed system architecture that provides uniform and efficient access to data and services irrespective of location or implementation . _",
    "data archives _ are assumed to already exist and will vary considerably in implementation and access policy .",
    "_ metadata standards _ will be devised to provide a well defined means to describe archives , data collections , and services .",
    "a _ data access layer _ will provide a single uniform interface to all data and services , and will be used both to link archives and services within the framework of nvo , and to allow user applications to access nvo resources .",
    "_ query and compute services _ will provide the tools for information discovery and large scale correlation and analysis of disparate datasets .",
    "_ data mining applications _",
    ", running on a user workstation at their home institution , as applets within a web browser , or at a major nvo data center , will provide the main user interface to enable science with the nvo .",
    "data archives store _ datasets _ ( _ e.g. _ ,  catalogs , images , and spectra ) organized into logically related _ data collections _ , as well as _",
    "metadata _ describing the archive and its data holdings .",
    "access is provided in various ways such as via a structured web interface , via a standard file - oriented interface such as ftp , or via other access protocols which may vary from archive to archive .",
    "nvo will place no requirements on data archives other than that they be made accessible to nvo via the data access layer ( dal ) , which serves as the portal by which nvo gains access to the archive . in the simplest cases interfacing an archive to nvo will be little more than a matter of installing the data access layer software and modifying a few configuration files to reflect the data holdings and access permissions of the local archive , much as one would install a web server .",
    "more sophisticated installations may provide expanded support for metadata access and server - side functions , as outlined in the discussion of the data access layer below .",
    "metadata ( literally , `` data about data '' ) is structured information describing some element of the nvo .",
    "metadata will be required to describe archives , the services provided by those archives , the data collections available from an archive , the structure and semantics ( meaning ) of individual data collections , and the structure and semantics of individual datasets within a collection .",
    "typical astronomical datasets are data objects such as catalogs , images , or spectra . as an example , the semantic metadata for a typical astronomical image is the logical content of the fits header of the image .",
    "metadata describing astronomical data is essential to enable _ data discovery _ and _ data interoperability_. metadata describing archives and services is necessary to allow the components of nvo to interoperate in an automated fashion .",
    "_ metadata standards _ are desirable to make these problems more tractable . in practice",
    "there are limits to what can be done to standardize dataset specific metadata , but mediation techniques such as those being developed by the digital library community provide ways to combine metadata dialects developed by different communities for similar types of data .",
    "current projects such as astrobrowse and isaia ( interoperable systems for archival information access ) represent initial efforts within the astronomical community to establish metadata standards .      the data access layer ( dal )",
    "will provide a uniform interface to all data , metadata , and compute services within nvo . at the lowest level the data access layer",
    "is a standard _",
    "protocol _ defining how the software components of the nvo talk to each other .",
    "reference grade software implementing the protocol will also be provided , which can either be used directly or taken as the basis for further development by the community .",
    "this software will include server - side software used to interface archives and compute services to the nvo , and client - side applications programming interfaces ( apis ) , which can be used to write nvo - aware distributed data mining applications . since the dal is fundamentally a protocol , multiple apis will be possible , _ e.g.",
    "_ ,  to support legacy software or multiple language environments .",
    "the key aspect of the data access layer is that it provides a uniform interface to _ all _ data and services within nvo .",
    "user applications use the data access layer to access nvo data and services , and archives and compute services _ within _ the nvo use the data access layer internally to access data or services in other archives , potentially generating a cascade of such references .",
    "nvo is thus an inherently hierarchical , distributed system , which nonetheless has a simple structure since all components share the same interface . in addition to such _",
    "location transparency _ , the data access layer will provide _ storage transparency _ , hiding the details of how data are stored within an archive . finally , the data access layer protocol will define standard data models ( at the protocol level ) for astronomical data objects such as images and spectra .",
    "archive maintainers will provide server - side modules to perform _ data model translation _ when data objects are accessed , allowing applications to process remote data regardless of its source or how it is stored within a particular archive .",
    "often a client program using the data access layer will not need an entire dataset , but only a portion . _ server - side functions _ will permit subsetting , filtering , and data model translation of individual datasets . in some cases",
    "_ user defined functions _ may be downloaded and applied to the data to compute the result returned to the remote client .",
    "this is critical to reduce network loading and distribute computation .    since the data access layer can be used to read both metadata and actual datasets from a remote archive , _ dataset replication",
    "_ becomes possible , allowing a _",
    "local data cache _ to be maintained .",
    "this is critical to optimizing data access throughout the nvo , and will be necessary to even attempt many large scale statistical studies and correlations .",
    "dataset replication also makes it possible to replicate entire data collections , and to migrate data archives forward in time .",
    "metadata replication and ingest makes it possible for a central site to automatically index entire remote archives .",
    "while the data access layer and metadata standards will allow the nvo to link archives and access data , _ query and compute services _ will be required to support information discovery and provide the statistical correlation and image analysis capabilities required for data mining .",
    "while most archives will provide basic query services for the data collections they support , large scale data mining does not become possible until multiple catalogs are combined ( correlated ) to search for objects matching some statistical signature .",
    "the larger nvo data centers will provide the data and computational resources required to support such _ large scale correlations_. while a query or correlation may result in subqueries to remote archives , extensive use of dataset replication and caching will be employed to optimize queries for commonly accessed catalogs or archives .",
    "sophisticated metadata mediation techniques will be required to combine the results from different catalogs .    in some cases pixel - level analysis of the original processed data , using an algorithmic function downloaded by the user ,",
    "may be required to compute new object parameters to refine a parametric search ( in effect this operation is dynamically adding columns to an existing catalog , an extremely powerful technique ) . since with nvo candidate object lists may contain several hundred million objects , this is a massively parallel problem such as might require a terascale supercomputer to address .",
    "even in the case of large scale statistical studies , distributed computing techniques and fast networks may allow the user to work from their home institution , but some form of peer reviewed time allocation may be required to allocate the necessary computational and storage resources . for some larger studies users may need to visit a nvo data center in order to have efficient access to personnel as well as data , software , and computational resources .",
    "the field of data mining , including visualization and statistical analysis of large multivariate datasets , is still in its infancy .",
    "this will be an area of active research for many years to come .",
    "most current astronomical data analysis software will need to be upgraded to become `` nvo - aware '' , able to be used equally well on both local and remote data .",
    "new applications will be developed as part of ongoing research into data mining techniques . while nvo should provide the interfaces and toolkits required to support this development , as well as some initial data mining applications from the major nvo centers , the open - ended nature of the problem",
    "suggests the need for a multidisciplinary data mining research grants program once nvo becomes operational .      in all areas",
    " storage technology , information management , data handling , distributed and parallel computing , high speed networking , data visualization , data mining ",
    "nvo will push the limits of current technology .",
    "partnerships with academia and industry will be necessary to research and develop the informations systems technology necessary to implement nvo .",
    "collaborations with other branches of science and with the national supercomputer centers will be required to develop standards for metadata handling , data handling and distributed computing .",
    "data mining is an inherently multidisciplinary problem which will require the partnership of astronomers , computer scientists , mathematicians , and software professionals to address .    a next generation , high speed national research internet is already in place , but is underutilized at present due to the lack of credible academic applications designed to make use of high performance networking .",
    "nvo would be a prime example of a creative new way to use wide area high performance networking for academic research .      given the wealth of real science data the nvo will make freely available via the internet , and the keen interest of the public in astronomy , _ the nvo will be uniquely suited for education and advancing science literacy . _",
    "the intrinsic internet - based nature of the nvo lends itself to a variety of high - quality science popularization and education methods with _ an unprecedented social and geographical outreach . _",
    "we anticipate that education and outreach professionals ( educators , staff members of planetaria , science museums , popular science writers and journalists , _ etc . _  )",
    "would become actively involved in utilizing this remarkable set of resources , creating of popular science websites , course materials ( from elementary to graduate school ) , and sophisticated demonstrations .",
    "schools with modest science education resources would be able to find hands - on demonstrations on line .",
    "applet software running in commodity web browsers will permit nvo data to be accessed and visualized by the public , allowing virtual observations to be taken and the resultant data analyzed and interpreted .",
    "we expect that _ a range of outreach partnerships will be developed with the nvo as a centerpiece and as a catalyst .",
    "_    the nvo is especially interesting as a science and technology education focus because _ it bridges a physical science ( astronomy ) and applied computer science . _",
    "it thus employs a range of technologies and skills relevant to many aspects of the economy and society as a whole in the 21st century .",
    "real - life examples of the use of such methodologies can be a powerful way to teach material that may otherwise be a very dry or difficult .",
    "for example , we note the great popular success of the seti@home project ; one can envision more sophisticated examples where data mining techniques are used by large numbers of people on comparably exciting problems spawned within the nvo .",
    "previous sections have described the technological changes that will enable a `` new astronomy '' and the characteristics of an nvo that can capitalize and build upon those changes to enable new and more cost effective science than would otherwise be possible .    the fundamental basis for the nvo management activities will be to recognize the science driven nature of the nvo and to maximize the community participation in the nvo effort .",
    "there will be three levels of activity and funding .",
    "these are structured to ensure that there is a usable and well documented infrastructure , that the software projects are science driven , and that bulk of the funding is dispersed to well focused science based proposals that are peer reviewed .    1 .",
    "the highest priority is to build the archive infrastructure and well documented protocols to access the data .",
    "these will be standards for data access that the community can rely on to build higher level tools .",
    "these would evolve as the technology advances , but should always be backward compatible .",
    "this infrastructure is funded via a base budget and is developed and maintained by the major nvo distributed sites .",
    "2 .   there will be regular `` aos '' for opportunities to build `` software tools '' that utilize the infrastructure .",
    "they would be delivered to the nvo for wider use by the community and would follow standards defined by the nvo .",
    "it is important that these tool building opportunities cover a wide range of possibilities and engage a large part of the community .",
    "a strong science enabling case for each software tool must be made , but they will be general user facilities that the entire community can use to do research .",
    "3 .   there are regular `` aos '' to use the nvo",
    ". these would be more specific research projects with a well defined goal , that might include software development .",
    "( this would be similar to the current nasa adp program )",
    ". these would be much less structured in the sense of being grants and with the deliverable being a paper to a journal .",
    "implementation of the nvo would occur in several stages , from preliminary preparation to fully operational stages . _",
    "a major objective of the implementation plan is to begin providing some levels of functionality as quickly as possible through use of existing tools and services_.        * develop relevant position papers , supporting documents , and a `` science reference mission '' which identifies the key science goals for the nvo ; * initiate work within participating organizations to ensure accessibility of data and the establishment of archives ; * develop essential enabling technologies , such as information exchange protocols and metadata standards ; * establish catalog search and/or image data retrieval capability for selected data subsets at all major sites ; * initiate community involvement through meetings and workshops ; and * open lines of communication with the international community concerning general nvo initiative .        *",
    "expand and formalize the data discovery and data delivery systems , including establishment of metadata standards , transport protocols , and presentation services ; * continue to work with all sites to improve access to online services ; * plan for eventual network connectivity and computational requirements ; * deploy small scale cross - correlation capabilities and visualization tools ; * prototype large scale cross - correlation facilities ; * continue community involvement through meetings , workshops , and the establishment of a users committee and a visiting committee ; * establish core technology and management groups and establish reporting and accountability procedures ; * identify subsets of nvo functionality that can be most effectively developed by existing data centers or other entities ; * establish an outreach program ; * move forward in the design and establishment of an international information infrastructure for astronomy ; and * foster communication and collaborations with efforts to advance information technology in other fields .",
    "* begin putting network and associated computing facilities in place ; * develop and deploy visualization tools for complex datasets ; * develop and make initial deployment of the data access layer ( dal ) ; * ensure that the data discovery and comparison tools are now mature and in routine operation ; * establish partnerships with international organizations to assure interoperability of us and non - us facilities and services ; * management structure and advisory committees now in routine operation .",
    "* breadth of data services extended to additional facilities , including international collaborators ; * data access layer deployed and in routine operation ; * support user - defined portable processing agents ; * establish support of higher level data products , such as pre - prepared cross identifications .",
    "this implementation timetable is only approximate and will naturally evolve as the problems become more well defined and as the level of support for the nvo becomes clearer . however , this timetable is `` optimal '' in that it reflects estimates of an ideal implementation path for the nvo functionality .",
    "services are estimated to be implemented as rapidly as is feasible from a technical point of view ; restricted funding levels below the optimal level would clearly slow this process ."
