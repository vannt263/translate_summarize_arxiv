    "this ansatz reduces an original partial differential equation ( pde ) model to a few degrees of freedom establishing equations describing the approximate dynamics appropriately projected into the solution space spanned by the ansatz . the variational approximation ( va ) method projects the high - dimensional dynamics to a low - dimensional dynamical system for the time - dependent parameters that encapsulate the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the original complex system",
    "it is important to note that there is an intrinsic drawback of va methods in that they have a strong restriction when projecting the infinite - dimensional dynamics of the original pde to a small finite - dimensional ansatz subspace .",
    "this projection is known to potentially lead to invalid results  @xcite , a feature which is naturally expected ( given the large reduction in the number of degrees of freedom ) when the full pde dynamics ceases to be well - described by the selected ansatz .",
    "nonetheless , there have been some efforts to control the corrections of the va to increase the accuracy of the results  @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , the variational method relies on the existence of a lagrangian or hamiltonian structure from which the euler - lagrange equations can be derived .",
    "this prerequisite limits the application of the variational approach to conservative , _",
    "closed systems_.    the recent work by galley  @xcite offers a new perspective to the classical mechanical formulations by recognizing that the hamilton - lagrangian formulation has the key feature of being a boundary value problem in time although it is used to derive equations of motion that are solved with initial data . by treating the extremization problem as an initial value problem",
    ", variational calculus can be applied to non - conservative systems .",
    "although galley s proposal was for classical mechanical , few - degree - of - freedom systems , i.e. , systems described by ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , it paved the way for its application to dispersive nonlinear pdes . the relevance and validity of the extension of galley s method to nonlinear pdes was showcased in the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite where examples cases based on a @xmath0-symmetric sine - gordon and @xmath1 models were presented .",
    "this work recognized that not only can the method be utilized for infinite degree - of - freedom systems , but its lagrangian underpinning enables a variational approach to be developed for non - conservative pde systems .",
    "@xcite illustrated very good agreement between the original pde dynamics and the reduced ode model , obtained from the corresponding non - conservation variational approximation ( ncva ) .    in this manuscript",
    "we present the extension of this ncva method for the specific , but broadly important / applicable case of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . the latter model and its variants are of principal interest to applications from optical physics  @xcite , atomic physics  @xcite and other areas of mathematical physics  @xcite , not only in their conservative , but also in dissipative variants of the model  @xcite .",

    "then , we extend this methodology to the nls equation and compare it to the perturbative variational approximations , examined previously .",
    "we , in fact , prove that these different methods , within the nls setting , are equivalent . in sec .",
    "[ sec : aps ] we present a few examples of nls settings including non - hamiltonian terms .",

    "subsequently , we will use the ncva to study the dynamical characteristics of nonlinear waves in the perturbed nls model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , galley highlights that the time - symmetric and conservative dynamics in hamiltonian systems is due to the boundary value form of the action extremization problem . as such",
    ", the original formalism based on extremization of an action functional is predicated on the conservative nature of the system .",
    "therefore , a direct application of action extremization when the system includes non - conservative terms is , by construction , not viable . as galley points out , in simple classical mechanics cases where the dissipation forces are local in time and _ linear _ in the velocities",
    ", it is possible to employ rayleigh s dissipation function  @xcite .",
    "however , this formulation can not be applied to systems with more general dissipative forces such as nonlocal or _ nonlinear _ ones .",
    "therefore , in order to treat systems with general forces , galley proposed to consider the extremization problem as an _ initial value problem _ instead .",
    "the method is based on considering two sets of variables , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and applying variational calculus for the non - conservative system provided @xmath4 after the variation . consider the path @xmath5 passing through the ( fixed ) boundary values @xmath6 at @xmath7 ( initial ) and @xmath8 at @xmath9 ( final ) .",
    "suppose that the system trajectories are described by the following set of @xmath10 generalized coordinates and velocities : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "let us now double both sets of quantities , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and parametrize both coordinate paths : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the coordinates of two stationary paths ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 are arbitrary virtual displacements .",
    "the following equality conditions are required for varying the action such that the endpoints coincide : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 therefore , the equality condition does not fix either value at the final time .",

    "similarly , in the @xmath38 , the euler - lagrange equations yield to the equations of motion .",

    "( [ el1 ] ) and ( [ el2 ] ) .",
    "since in our considerations below we are concerned with complex non - conservative forces , the non - conservative term @xmath22 will be complex as well .",
    "the terms in @xmath22 are precisely responsible for coupling both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 paths to each other .",
    "it is important to note that the complex conjugate of the functional terms in @xmath43 are necessary for solving the euler - lagrange equations when considering coordinates containing complex terms which is precisely the case for the nls under consideration . in the physical limit ,",
    "only the euler - lagrange equation for the @xmath44 variables survives .",
    "therefore , expanding the action in powers of @xmath45 the equations of motion follow the variational principle : @xmath46 } { \\delta \\vec{q}_- ( t)}\\bigg]_{\\rm pl } = 0.\\ ] ] this also has the consequence that only terms in the new action that are perturbatively linear in @xmath45 contribute to physical forces .",
    "let us now extend the ncva formalism for the nls equation .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this stage that the nls equation is , arguably , a prototypical nonlinear pde that supports travelling envelope waves .",

    "it is possible to reduce the original infinite - dimensional dynamics to a system of ordinary differential equations on the ansatz parameters .",
    "we show that the resulting non - conservative variational method for the nonlinear schrdinger equation is equivalent to the ( linear ) perturbative variational method .",

    "we also showcase the application of this method to exciton - polariton condensates that are inherently lossy and need a pumping term to balance losses . in all cases",
    "we see a very good qualitative and also , in principle , quantitative agreement ( with the partial exception of the exciton - polariton condensate ) between the original dynamics and statics for the nonlinear schrdinger equation and its corresponding reduced non - conservative variational counterpart .",
    "this agreement seems to be preserved even when the non - conservative terms are of the same order of magnitude as the other ( conservative ) terms .",
    "this is in contrast with perturbation methods that intrinsically rely on the non - conserved terms being small when compared to the conserved ones",
    ".    it would be interesting to apply in more detail the non - conservative variational methodology studied here further to exciton - polariton condensates more specifically that are , intrinsically , open systems of high interest and significant impact to ongoing experimental efforts .",
    "in particular , such an approach would be valuable towards detecting the boundaries for stability inversion reported in ref .",
    "it was noted in that work that , surprisingly , for some parameters values , the ( originally ) `` excited '' dark soliton state ( with one nodal point ) becomes stable in favor of the nodeless cloud state ( the state without the dark soliton corresponding to the original ground state of the system in the absence on non - conservative terms ) which in turn loses its stability . a systematic study of the dark soliton and its stability in such condensates can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . also valuable would be to extend this approach to the two - dimensional case where the equivalent stability inversion for vortices and rotating lattices has also been reported  @xcite .",
    "this work opens , more broadly , a few interesting avenues for future explorations . in particular , it opens the possibility to apply a similar methodology to other models described by partial differential equations which contain non - conservative terms .",
    "the non - conservative variational methodology could prove very useful in cases where traditional perturbative techniques , relying on the smallness of the non - conserved terms , fail due to the magnitude of the perturbations .",
