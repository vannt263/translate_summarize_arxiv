    "high temperature superconducting ( hts ) wires with long lengths composed of y - based or rare - earth - based superconductors have been developed and have recently become commercially available .",
    "these hts wires , called coated conductors , are in the form of a tape with a width of several millimetres and include a superconducting ( sc ) layer with a thickness of a few micrometers . since the aspect ratio of the cross section of the sc layer , which is defined as the ratio of the width to the thickness , is more than 1000 , and also , these superconductors themselves have a layered crystal structure , the electromagnetic properties such as critical current density and ac loss have an anisotropy and depend on the direction of an externally applied magnetic field , as well as its magnitude .",
    "hts magnets wound with coated conductors are also expected to be operated , not only by immersion cooling with liquid helium or nitrogen , but also by conduction cooling with a cryocooler .",
    "therefore , evaluation of the ac losses during the charging up or down of the hts magnets cooled using cryocoolers has become very important in order to prevent thermal runaway of the magnets .",
    "this is because the thermal runaway is caused by excess heating power that is beyond the cooling power of the cryocoolers .",
    "it has also become well known that the transport current flowing in the coated conductor itself affects the ac loss property in an externally applied cyclic magnetic field  @xcite . currently , there is no useful expression to evaluate the magnitude of ac loss in coated conductors that are exposed to both external magnetic fields and transport currents varying at constant sweep rates .",
    "a set of recent reports have estimated ac losses in hts insert coils wound with coated conductors for a 32-t high field magnet  @xcite .",
    "since these hts inserts are immersed in liquid helium , the total amount of ac losses during the charging or discharging process is focused there . in the case of an hts insert coil",
    "cooled using a cryocooler , however , it may be necessary to evaluate the magnitude of the instantaneous ac loss .",
    "the proposed expression to estimate the ac losses in the hts inserts for the 32-t magnet is also applicable to the case where the radial component of a local magnetic field , applied to every part of the windings in solenoid coils , is larger than the full penetration field .",
    "however , such a situation can not be realized for an hts insert in a high field magnet with a relatively large height .",
    "it is well known that , if the magnitude of the local magnetic field does not exceed the full penetration field , the magnetic interactions between the sc wires strongly affect the ac loss properties , for example , for coils wound with nbti wires  @xcite , stacks of bscco tapes  @xcite , and stacks of coated conductors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although numerical analyses of ac loss in bundles of coated conductors have been carried out for their stacks  @xcite , single pancake coils  @xcite , racetrack coils  @xcite , and power transmission cables  @xcite , the numbers of coated conductors used for numerical modelling are limited to less than 200 .    in this paper ,",
    "ac losses in an hts insert coil designed for a high field magnet  @xcite are numerically evaluated .",
    "it is assumed that the hts insert is composed of a stack of single pancake coils wound using coated conductors and energized up to a rated current at a constant ramping rate under conduction cooling using cryocoolers .",
    "the influences of the magnitudes and orientations of locally applied magnetic fields , magnetic interactions between turns , and transport currents flowing in the windings are taken into account in the calculations of the ac losses .",
    "a 25-t - class cryogen - free sc magnet has recently been designed  @xcite .",
    "an hts insert coil is located coaxially inside six low temperature superconducting ( lts ) outsert coils .",
    "the combination of lts coils wound using nbti or nb@xmath0sn wire generates a central magnetic field of 14.0  t. the specifications of the hts insert are listed in .",
    "gd - based coated conductors with a width of 5.00  mm and a thickness of 0.13  mm are wound into 68 single pancakes with 438 turns .",
    "the inner radius , outer radius , and height of the hts insert are 48.0  mm , 140  mm , and 394.4  mm , respectively .",
    "this hts insert is operated at 135  a and generates a central magnetic field of 11.5  t. therefore , the total central field generated by the combination of the hts insert and the lts coils becomes 25.5  t. the hts insert and the lts coils are cooled individually using cryocoolers .",
    "two 2-stage gifford - mcmahon cryocoolers with 1.5  w at 4.2  k are used for the cooling of the hts insert .",
    "the energizing time of up to 25.5  t is set to less than 60  min .",
    "shows the numerical results of profiles of magnetic fields inside the upper half of the hts insert coil combined with the lts outsert coils .",
    "all the coils generate a total central field of 25.5  t. figures [ fig1](a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) plot the contour maps of the radial , @xmath1  ( t ) , and axial , @xmath2  ( t ) , components of the local magnetic field , its magnitude @xmath3  ( t ) , and angle @xmath4  ( deg . ) , respectively .",

    "it can be seen in that the inner product of the two vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which is used to evaluate the area of the magnetization loop , is deformed into the sum of two components , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "although the components @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the magnetization are generally given as a function of the local magnetic field , @xmath23 , the first and second terms in could correspond to the contributions of the parallel and perpendicular components , respectively , if it is assumed that @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend only on @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 could be given by the simple sum of the individual contributions of the parallel - field loss , @xmath26 , ( due to the parallel field @xmath24 ) and a perpendicular - field loss , @xmath27 , ( due to the perpendicular field @xmath25 ) .    by extending the above - mentioned idea to evaluate ac losses in a solenoid magnet composed of pancake coils wound using coated conductors ,",
    "the total loss , @xmath28 , in the magnet can be expressed by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of single pancakes and @xmath31 is the number of turns per single pancake .",
    "means that the ac losses in the individual turns are estimated and summed .",
    "the local magnetic field , @xmath23 , exposed to one turn under consideration , has axial and radial components @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , which are directed parallel and perpendicular to the wide surface of the hts tape wound flatwise , respectively .",
    "thus , means that the ac loss of the @xmath34-th turn can be obtained simply by adding the parallel - field loss , @xmath35 , determined by the axial field , @xmath32 , and the perpendicular - field loss , @xmath36 , determined by the radial field , @xmath33 .",

    ", the dependence of the critical current density , @xmath40 , on the local magnetic field has to be taken into account .",

    "in order to evaluate the influence of magnetic interaction between sc tapes , ac losses in thin strips are numerically calculated by means of a one - dimensional finite element method formulated using only a current vector potential , @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "let us consider sc strips with an infinite length in the @xmath56-direction , of which the thickness , @xmath38 , in the @xmath57-direction is much smaller than the width , @xmath39 , in the @xmath58-direction .",
    "the @xmath31 strips are also stacked face - to - face at even intervals of @xmath59 in the @xmath57direction , and one of the strips under consideration is exposed to an external magnetic field , @xmath60 , in the @xmath57-direction . in this case , a local current density , @xmath61 , in the strip under consideration has only the @xmath56-component @xmath62 as a function of the position @xmath58 , and the current vector potential , @xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 , has only the @xmath57-component @xmath65 .",

    "<S> ac losses in a high temperature superconducting ( hts ) insert coil for a 25-t cryogen - free superconducting magnet are numerically calculated during its energization , assuming slab approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the hts insert coil consists of 68 single pancakes wound with coated conductors and generating a central magnetic field of 11.5  t , in addition to a contribution of 14.0  t from a set of low temperature superconducting ( lts ) outsert coils . </S>",
    "<S> both the hts and lts coils are cooled using cryocoolers , and energized simultaneously up to 25.5  t with a constant ramp rate for 60  min . </S>",
    "<S> the influences of the magnitudes and orientations of the locally applied magnetic fields , magnetic interactions between turns , and the transport currents flowing in the windings are taken into account in the ac loss calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the locally applied fields are separated into axial and radial components , and the individual contributions of these field components to the ac losses are summed simply to obtain the total losses . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the axial field component to the total ac loss is large at the early stages of the energization , whereas the total losses monotonically increase with time after the contribution of the radial field component becomes sufficiently large . </S>"
