    "the one - loop effective action plays a central role in quantum field theories . however , the explicit evaluation of it is usually very difficult and analytic results are known only in limited cases .    recently there has been a significant progress in this problem when background fields have radial symmetry , using the partial wave analysis@xcite .",
    "introduction of a cut - off in the partial wave sum and separation of the sum into two parts is a key of the idea .",
    "a radial wkb expansion which is uniformly valid for the large angular momentum part is developed .",
    "proper renormalization counterterms are taken into account there .",
    "combination of the leading terms of this wkb expansion and the contributions from the low angular momentum part provides us a finite renormalized value in the limit of large cutoff value .",
    "it also turns out that the inclusion of higher order terms in the uniform radial wkb expansion greatly improves the rate of convergence in the infinite sum@xcite .    in this work",

    "here @xmath3 is a radial potential vanishing sufficiently fast at infinity . using the partial wave analysis ,",

    "the associated radial differential operator@xmath7 is given by @xmath8 with the effective potential @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the individual radial determinant ratio @xmath12 in ( [ detlsum ] ) can be evaluated easily by using the gelfand - yaglom method@xcite @xmath13 where the wave functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the solutions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively and both of them behave as @xmath18 near @xmath19 .    the infinite sum in ( [ detlsum ] ) is formally divergent .",
    "this problem is related to renormalization .",
    "there exists an elegant way to extract the renormalized quantity @xmath20 from @xmath21@xcite .",
    "another problem is the slow rate of convergence of the @xmath5-sum .",
    "both of these problems can be solved by splitting the sum into two pieces : the low angular momentum part @xmath22 and the high angular momentum part @xmath23 as @xmath24 here we introduce a cut - off @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the ` conventional ' renormalization counterterm .",
    "each @xmath12 in the part @xmath22 can be evaluated using the above gelfand - yaglom method .",
    "since @xmath12 behaves like @xmath27 for large @xmath5 and @xmath28 increases as @xmath29 , @xmath22 behaves like @xmath30 for @xmath31 in the large @xmath25 limit .",
    "( this reveals the divergent structures in the formal expression in ( [ detlsum ] ) ) . as for the part @xmath23",
    ", we can evaluate it _ analytically _ in a uniform asymptotic series of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 s may have an implicit @xmath25 dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 behaves as @xmath36 in the large @xmath25 limit .",
    "one can find explicit forms of the @xmath37 s with derivation in a recent work@xcite .",
    "now let us consider the case with very large value of @xmath25 .",
    "note that , as @xmath38 , unsuppressed terms in the expansion ( [ asympl ] ) may grow but they match precisely the divergences coming from @xmath22 with the opposite sign .",

    "but we still have a practical problem related with the convergence rate .    with a finite value of @xmath25 , we can write the following formula for @xmath20 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 refers to the order of truncation . in this formula",
    "the error is indicated by the last term and it is totally under control .",
    "it is apparent that we get a more accurate value of @xmath20 by taking into account more @xmath42-suppressed terms for a given value of the cutoff @xmath25 . in the subsequent sections , by applying this method to the evaluation of the instanton determinant , we demonstrate the power of our method .",
    "we apply our method to the case of the instanton determinant with @xmath43 where an exact computation is possible@xcite . now the partial derivative @xmath44 in @xmath45 should be replaced with @xmath46 . here",
