    "the important subclass of those @xmath26 that satisfy a doubling condition will be denoted by @xmath27 : @xmath28    clearly , if @xmath29 , the same inequality will hold ( with some other constant ) if 2 is replaced by any other @xmath30 .",

    "it is well known that a set of hausdorff dimension @xmath2 can have zero , positive or infinite @xmath2-dimensional measure .",
    "the desirable situation , in general , is to work with a set which is _ truly _ @xmath2-dimensional , that is , it has positive and finite @xmath2-dimensional measure . in this case",
    "we refer to this set as an @xmath2-set .",
    "now , given an @xmath2-dimensional set @xmath15 without this last property , one could expect to find in the class @xmath37 an appropriate function @xmath8 to detect the precise  size \" of it . by",

    "the conjecture was proven by davies @xcite in @xmath16 and remains open for higher dimensions . since in the class of planar kakeya sets",
    "there are several distinct types of two dimensional sets ( i.e. with positive or null lebesgue measure ) , one would like to associate a dimension function to the whole class . a dimension function @xmath26 will be called the exact hausdorff dimension function of the class of sets @xmath39 if    * for every set @xmath15 in the class @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "* there are sets @xmath41 with @xmath42 .    in the direction of finding the exact dimension of the class of kakeya sets in @xmath16 , keich @xcite",

    "this notion of speed of convergence to zero will allow us to define a partial order between dimension functions that extends the usual order on the power laws ( see ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the problem of studying the exact hausdorff dimension of the class of furstenberg - type sets ( for the precise definition , see ) .",
    "we are able to find lower bounds for the dimension function , i.e. for a given class of furstenberg - type sets , we find a dimension function @xmath8 with the property that any set in the class has positive @xmath31-measure",

    "moreover , the authors prove that this is also a dimensionless set , i.e. there is no @xmath48 such that @xmath49 ( equivalently , for any dimension function @xmath8 , one has @xmath50 ) . in that direction ,",
    "further improvements are due to elekes and keleti @xcite .",

    "so in particular they answer the more interesting question that there is no exact hausdorff - dimension function for @xmath47 even in the stronger sense when requiring only sigma - finiteness instead of finiteness .",

    "on the other hand , the latter says that it is sufficient that @xmath8 satisfies the bound @xmath318 for @xmath198 . in both cases",
    "we prove that an @xmath315-set must have hausdorff dimension at least 1 , but gives a better estimate on the logarithmic gap .",
    "in this section we look at a class of very small furstenberg sets .",
    "we will study , roughly speaking , the extremal case of @xmath319-sets and ask ourselves if inequality can be extended to this class . according to the definition of @xmath17-sets",
    ", this class should be the one formed by sets having a zero dimensional linear set in every direction .",
    "we will call a dimension function @xmath56 `` zero dimensional '' if @xmath320 for all @xmath98 .",
    "let us introduce the following subclasses of @xmath319 :    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     our approach to the problem , using dimension functions , allows us to tackle the problem about the dimensionality of these sets in some cases .",
    "we study the case of @xmath57-sets associated to one particular choice of @xmath56 .",
    "we will look at the function @xmath321 as a model of  zero dimensional \" dimension function .",
    "our next theorem will show that in this case inequality can indeed be extended .",
    "the trick here will be to replace the dyadic scale on the radii in @xmath132 with a faster decreasing sequence @xmath322 .",
    "the main difference will be in the estimate of the quantity of lines in @xmath241-separated directions that intersect two balls of level @xmath132 with a fixed distance @xmath246 between them .",
    "this estimate is given by .",
    "we can prove the next theorem , which provide a class of examples of zero dimensional @xmath57-sets .",
    "let @xmath323 and let @xmath15 be an @xmath57-set",
    ". then @xmath324 .",
    "take a non - negative sequence @xmath325 which will be determined later .",
    "we will apply the splitting as in the previous section . for this , take @xmath274 as in associated to the sequence @xmath326 .",
    "now , for a given generic @xmath118-covering of @xmath15 with @xmath327 , we use to obtain a decomposition @xmath281 with @xmath328 where @xmath329 , @xmath330 is the partition of the radii associated to @xmath325 and @xmath331 is a suitable constant .",
    "we apply the splitting to @xmath283 to obtain two @xmath332-separated intervals @xmath333 and @xmath334 with @xmath335 .",
    "now , let @xmath336 be a @xmath241-separated subset of @xmath136 .",
    "therefore @xmath337 .",
    "we also define , as in , @xmath338 and @xmath339    by , we obtain @xmath340 and the same calculations as in ( inequality ) yield @xmath341    now we estimate a sum like . for @xmath342 we have @xmath343 in the last inequality we use that the terms are all non - negative . the goal now is to take some rapidly decreasing sequence such that the factor @xmath344 beats the factor @xmath345 .",
    "let us take @xmath346 and consider the hyperdyadic scale @xmath347 . with this choice , we have @xmath348 replacing this in inequality we obtain @xmath349 finally , since by the positivity of @xmath350 the double exponential in the numerator grows much faster than the denominator , we obtain @xmath351 and therefore @xmath352    let @xmath353 . if @xmath15 is an @xmath57-set with @xmath354 then @xmath324 .",
    "this follows immediately , since in this case the only change will be @xmath355 so the double exponential still grows faster and therefore @xmath356    this shows that there is a whole class of @xmath319-sets that must be at least @xmath357-dimensional .",
    "now , in the opposite direction , we will show some examples of very small @xmath319-sets .",
    "the first observation is that it is possible to construct @xmath358-sets and even @xmath359-sets with hausdorff dimension not exceeding @xmath357 .",
    "this can be done with some suitable modifications of the construction made in @xcite , remark 1.5 , ( p. 10 ) . there , for each @xmath360 , an @xmath17-set is constructed whose dimension is not greater than @xmath361 .",
    "it is straightforward to modify that construction for it to hold even at the endpoint @xmath13 .",
    "we also include the following example of an @xmath362-set @xmath363 of dimension zero .",
