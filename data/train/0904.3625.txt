    "the recently discovered feas - based superconductors inspired study , as their superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical magnetic fields reach the values which are higher than those of mgb@xmath2 and comparable to those of the cuprate based superconductors ( cbs ) @xcite .",
    "one of interesting characteristics is that they show layered structure with conducting layers of feas and charge reservoir layers of reo , where re is a rare earth element @xcite .",
    "this layered structure is very similar to that of cbs , and suggests that the superconducting behaviors may have similarities to those of cbs .",
    "the vortex dynamics of cbs have been widely studied in theories and experiments @xcite . according to the theory , the thermally activated flux flow ( taff ) resistivity",
    "is expressed as @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is an attempt frequency for a flux bundle hopping , @xmath5 the hopping distance , @xmath6 the magnetic induction , @xmath7 the applied current density , @xmath8 the critical current density in the absence of flux creep , @xmath9 the bundle volume , and @xmath10 the temperature . if @xmath7 is small enough and @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the thermally activated energy ( tae ) , and @xmath14 . equation ( [ eq1 ] ) simply means that the prefactor @xmath15 is temperature and magnetic field dependent .",
    "generally , the tae of cbs is analyzed by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) using an assumption that the prefactor @xmath15 is temperature independent , and @xmath16 linearly depends on @xmath17 with the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath20 [ note that @xmath21 is the @xmath22 value for @xmath23 , @xmath24 the constant , @xmath25 the tae for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the importance is that the analysis leads to @xmath28 , and the apparent activate energy @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xcite . by drawing resistivity data in the so - called arrhenius plot with a relation @xmath31",
    ", one can easily determine @xmath32 with its corresponding slope in a low resistivity range .",
    "however , @xmath28 may not be true in reality , when a local slope of @xmath33 vs @xmath17 in the arrhenius plot shows a round curvature . as a result",
    ", the corresponding apparent activated energy @xmath34 shows a sharp increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "the phenomena means @xmath35 , @xmath36 const , and the determination of @xmath32 from the slopes is a problem . in the early stage of the discovery of cbs , the experimental observation of the abnormal phenomena had been reported by palstra _",
    "et al _ @xcite without solution .",
    "et al _ @xcite suggested that the temperature dependent of the prefactor in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) must be taken into account in the analysis . by using this suggestion to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath37 , the derivative , @xmath38 [ 1+q t/(1-t ) ] , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 has a value in the range from 0.5 to 2 , and @xmath30 .    in this paper , taff resistivity of smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( sfaof )",
    "is studied with magnetic fields up to 9.0 t. by using the assumption @xmath40 const , and @xmath28 , the taff behaviors were first analyzed in the arrhenius plot .",
    "after that , by using the assumption that the prefactor @xmath15 is temperature dependent , and @xmath41 is not temperature dependent , the taff resistivity is analyzed in the other method in which equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is employed to determine @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath32 determinations from both methods are discussed and compared .",
    "we suggest that the second method shall be instead of the first in the analysis of taff characteristics of other superconductors .",
    "in addition , the vortex glass transition , zero resistivity temperature , and the temperature dependents of the critical fields determined from different resistivity criteria values in the superconducting transition regime are presented .",
    "the sfaof sample was prepared by a high - pressure synthesis method .",
    "smas powder ( pre - sintered ) and as , fe , fe@xmath2o@xmath42 , fef@xmath2 powders ( the purities of all starting chemicals are better than 99.99% ) were mixed together with the nominal stoichiometric ratio of sm[o@xmath43f@xmath44feas , then ground thoroughly and pressed into small pellets .",
    "the pellet was sealed in boron nitride crucibles and sintered in a high pressure synthesis apparatus under the pressure of 6.0 gpa and temperature of 1250@xmath45 c for two hours .",
    "the x - ray diffraction analysis showed that the main phase is laofeas structure with some impurity phases @xcite .",
    "it was cut into a rectangular shape with dimensions of 4.20 mm(length)@xmath46 1.60 mm(width ) @xmath46 1.08 mm(thickness ) .",
    "the standard four probe technique was used for resistivity @xmath47 measurements .",
    "bipolar pulsed dc current with an amplitude of 5.0 ma ( corresponding to the current density about @xmath480.29 a/@xmath49 ) was applied to it .",
    "the measurements were performed on a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) with the magnetic field up to 9 t. from the zero field @xmath50 data , we find that the superconducting transition width is about 1.7 k ( defined by the superconducting transition from 10% to 90% of the normal resistivity ) , and the zero resistant temperature @xmath51 is 52.2 k ( determined by the criterion of 0.1 @xmath52 cm ) .",
    "figure [ f1](a)-(c ) , respectively , show @xmath47 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 data with different symbols for 0.0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 7.0 , and 9.0 t fields .",
    "one shall notice that the suppression of the superconductivity at 9.0 t field is comparable to that of low anisotropic cbs , e.g. yba@xmath2cu@xmath42o@xmath55 ( ybco ) , and suggests that the anisotropy is similar to ybco .",
    "the so - called apparent activated energy @xmath56 data were generally used to analyze tae @xcite , and the derivative @xmath54 data is always used to analysis the vortex glass transition boundary @xcite .",
    "below , we will present our analysis .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the arrhenius plot of its resistivity in magnetic fields of @xmath57 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 7.0 , and 9.0 t with different symbols .",
    "the solid lines plot linear regressions in the low resistivity range . according to the conventional analysis method ,",
    "these linear fits are based on the assumption @xmath58 , where each @xmath32 was determined by using each slope .",
    "note that there is a cross point where all the linear fitting lines approximately focus together except for the line for zero field , and this point leads to @xmath59 k. the inset shows @xmath60 data and the corresponding solid line with the linear fitting @xmath61 . from the fitting",
    ", we determined @xmath62 m@xmath63 cm , and @xmath64 k which coincides with the value of @xmath65 .",
    "using the @xmath24 , @xmath27 , and @xmath32 data , we regressed the @xmath47 data as shown in figure [ f1](a ) with solid lines .",
    "since the assumption of @xmath58 leads to @xmath66 , we present @xmath32 data in figure [ f1](b ) with horizontal solid lines where each of them has a limited length .",
    "each length covers the temperature interval which corresponds to the interval of the reciprocal temperature for determining @xmath32 in the arrhenius plot . for decreasing temperature , note that each @xmath67 dataset approximately intersects its horizontal @xmath32 line center with a divergent trend in the temperature interval .",
    "this means that each @xmath32 approximates to the average value of its @xmath56 in the temperature interval .",
    "the similar divergent trends were also observed in ybco @xcite .",
    "the analysis indicates that the tae determined from the conventional method may have problems in characteristics , and the method suggested by zhang _ et al _ @xcite ought to be taken into consideration .    in figure [ f1](b )",
    ", one may have noticed that each @xmath68 set can be divided into five regimes : ( i ) the normal state regime at high temperature , where @xmath68 is almost temperature - and magnetic - field - independent ; ( ii ) the primary superconducting transition regime , where @xmath56 quickly increases and the resistivity begins sharply decreasing ( see figure [ f1](a ) ) ; ( iii ) the platform regime , where @xmath68 for each field measurement show a step structure ( see figure [ f1](b ) ) ; ( iv ) the second sharply increasing regime , where @xmath56 quickly increases into a high value range and @xmath69 data show a linear type ( see figure [ f1](c ) ) ; ( v ) the strong fluctuation regime , where @xmath67 curve shows an irregular shape due to the resistivity reaching the low measurable range .    for analyzing taff behaviors with the second analytic method",
    ", the first thing is to validate one or two regimes which relate to the taff behaviors .",
    "apparently , the data in regimes ( i ) and ( ii ) do not relate to taff behaviors , as the data are in the normal state in regime ( i ) and in the flux flow regime in regime ( ii ) .",
    "the data show a platform structure and possibly relate to taff behaviors in regime ( iii ) .",
    "note that resistivity data in the regime are only about one order of magnitude less than that in regime ( i ) ( where the resistivity is in the normal state ) [ see figure [ f1](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the data in regime ( iii ) are not in the taff regime @xcite . in regime ( iv ) , the resistivity is about 2 and 3 orders of magnitude less than that in regime ( i ) .",
    "the resistivity in this range , as suggested by palstra _",
    "et al _ @xcite , relates to taff behavior .",
    "according to the vortex glass transition theory , the linear ( ohmic ) resistivity ought to linearly vanish in a form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the vortex glass transition temperature @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath72 @xcite . in figure [ f1](b ) , one will easily find that @xmath73 curves show approximately linear curvatures in regime ( iv ) .",
    "the data in the regime ( v ) show irregular trend , as the resistivity is going to a deeply superconducting state where the resistivity may be dominated by non - ohmic characteristics ; besides , the measuring voltmeter reached its low measuring limitation in experiments .",
    "the analysis concludes that the taff resistivity is in regime ( iv ) .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows @xmath32 determined by the first analytic method with circles and by the second with triangles .",
    "the stars show corresponding @xmath74 for the second method .",
    "all the dash lines in figures [ f1](a ) and ( b ) , and figure [ f2 ] are regression curves with the regression parameters of @xmath32 and @xmath74 in figure [ f3 ] . in the analysis of these data with the second method , we first derived @xmath25 with equation ( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath25 is the only free parameter in the equation except for @xmath39 .",
    "we found that the energy relation , @xmath75 with @xmath76 , leads to good consistency to the experimental data , where @xmath30 , and @xmath77 k. after determination of each @xmath32 , each @xmath74 can be easily determined by fitting equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "one will find that all the regressions ( dashed lines ) in figure [ f1](a ) , figure [ f1](b ) , and figure [ f2 ] are in good agreement with experimental data and confirm the correctness of the analytic method .",
    "note that , although each temperature interval in regime ( iv ) , which we used to determine @xmath32 with the second analytic method , is somewhat less than that we used to determine @xmath32 with the first analytic method ( see figure [ f1](b ) and ( c ) ) , the regressions of the second method are still given better fitting results .    for magnetic field above 1.0 t , we find that @xmath78 for the data derived from arrhenius plot with the first method , and @xmath79 with the second method .",
    "note that the tae determined by the second method is about one order larger than that determined from the first as shown in the figure .",
    "the reason of the large difference between the two analytic methods is due to that the first method not taking into account the temperature dependent relation of the prefactor in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , while the second method takes into consideration .",
    "apparently , the second method is closer to the theoretical description .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows the vortex glass transition boundary @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84,where @xmath71 is the glass transition temperature , @xmath51 the zero resistance temperature , @xmath85 the 10% of the normal state resistivity temperature , @xmath86 the 50% and @xmath87 the 90% . here",
    ", @xmath80 was determined by using the @xmath88 relation [ dash lines in figure [ f2](c ) ] .",
    "we find that the data can be fitted by a relation @xmath89 , where @xmath90 t. the @xmath91 value may not be true in zero temperature , but it leads to a conclusion that the vortex melting field is very large for sfaof superconductor when the temperature approaches to zero .",
    "a similar characteristic can be also observed for @xmath81 data , since each @xmath92 is slightly higher than that @xmath93 .",
    "the normalized transition widths ( defined as @xmath94 are comparable to ybco , and thus suggest that the anisotropy of the sfaof is similar to ybco .",
    "the @xmath84 curve shows a steep increase indicating that the upper critical magnetic field of the superconductor is very high in low temperature .",
    "one may notice that the transition widths between @xmath92 and @xmath95 are comparable to that between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , suggesting that superconductor may have better analysis results when further improving the quality of the superconductor .    in comparisons ,",
    "a sample that was prepared in the same sample batch was used in ac susceptibility measurements with magnetic fields up to 7.0 t , and frequencies up to 1.11 khz .",
    "we found that @xmath93 is somewhat larger than the corresponding temperature of the peak in the imaginary component in ac susceptibility measurement .",
    "however , the similar @xmath97 increasing trends were also found in the ac measurement .",
    "besides , we found that the onset temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath98 of ac susceptibility measurement is somewhat higher than that of @xmath92 .",
    "detailed analysis of the ac measurement is just ongoing .",
    "in summary , we analyze the resistive taff behavior of sfaof with two theoretical analysis . for the first method , @xmath99 const and @xmath28 were assumed , and thus arrhenius plot was employed in analysis .",
    "this method is simple and easy in analysis , but the analysis results remain inconsistency to experimental data .",
    "the second method assumes that the prefactor @xmath15 is temperature dependent , while @xmath41 is not temperature dependent . by using the second method , equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "is obtained .",
    "the second method results in the regressions are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the tae analysis shows @xmath100 for magnetic field above 1.0 t. the second method is also simple and easy , since only two free parameters in analysis .",
    "we suggest that the second method shall be instead of the first for the analysis of taff behaviors of other superconductors .",
    "the study shows that critical magnetic fields of sfaof may have large values in low temperature and comparable to cbs .",
