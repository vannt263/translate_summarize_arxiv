    "hierarchical structure formation models are predicated on the assumption that structures grow via the gravitational collapse of small inhomogeneities in a gaussian random field .",
    "within such a model it is expected that galaxies and larger scale structures will form at local maxima of the density field @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities in such over - dense regions , that will go on to become the most massive rich clusters at the present day , tend to collapse earlier than similar inhomogeneities in less - dense regions @xcite .",
    "moreover , although the power spectrum of the fluctuations in these models are scale free , detailed numerical simulations show that they naturally create large - scale filamentary structures with the most massive bound systems , such as rich clusters , forming at intersections and junctions of these filaments @xcite .",
    "there is expected to be considerable cross - talk between structures forming on different scales in these models : with galaxy halos growing through major mergers within the larger - scale filaments and streaming down these into the forming cluster .",
    "these galaxies are most naturally identified as the progenitors of the homogeneous population of old , luminous elliptical galaxies which reside in rich clusters at the present day .",
    "these models thus predict that the forming elliptical galaxies should be distributed in a highly anisotropic fashion around the collapsing protocluster @xcite .",
    "to test these predictions requires observations in a waveband sensitive to massive star formation at high redshifts .",
    "recent progress in submillimeter astronomy has shown that star formation in massive galaxies at high redshifts is not a luminous phenomenon at optical wavelengths because of the obscuring effect of dust @xcite .",
    "the reprocessed starlight peaks at far - infrared wavelengths in the rest frame of the source and is shifted into the submillimeter waveband at @xmath2 . we also require a method of identifying an over - dense region of the early universe .",
    "one method is to target powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "submillimeter images of the @xmath3  mpc - scale fields around such agn ( high - redshift radio galaxies  hzrgs ) at @xmath4 show extended dust emission associated with the agn , and luminous submillimeter companions @xcite , several of which are confirmed to be at the same redshifts as the radio galaxies @xcite . while these results provide support for models of biased galaxy formation , they relate only to a very rare class of tracer galaxies , powerful hzrgs at @xmath5 . therefore ,",
    "if we are to investigate the formation of structures the size of typical clusters then less extreme , lower mass signpost agn at lower redshifts must be identified and their environments mapped at submillimeter wavelengths . with these points in mind",
    "we have initiated a programme to image the fields around @xmath6 qsos detected in the submillimeter waveband @xcite . here",
    "we report the first submillimeter imaging observations of one of these qsos , rxj094144.51 + 385434.8 at @xmath7 .",
    "a hubble constant @xmath8  kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 and density parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are assumed throughout this letter .",
    "observations were made with scuba @xcite at the jcmt in 2003 february and march . during all three nights",
    "on which data were gathered , weather conditions were in the top quartile of those experienced on mauna kea .",
    "we used ` jiggle - map ' mode to make simultaneous maps at 450 and 850  @xmath12 m .",
    "the secondary mirror was chopped @xmath13 in right ascension , and the antenna was nodded every 16 seconds .",
    "the resulting maps thus show the negative off - positions of real sources ( they have not been ` cleaned ' ) .",
    "the atmospheric opacity was monitored with regular skydips , and flux density calibration was made on each night with jiggle - map observations of the standard source crl618 .",
    "data were analysed with the starlink package , surf .",
    "data were first corrected for beam - switching , flat - fielded and extinction corrected .",
    "we then removed residual sky emission and clipped each bolometer at the 5-@xmath14 level before resampling the data onto a ra / dec grid and despiking at the 3-@xmath14 level .",
    "pointing drifts were corrected for with linear interpolation between the measured offsets ( in all cases less than @xmath15 ) .",
    "after flux density calibration , the data were rebinned to make the final signal and noise maps . for this process we used an adapted version of the surf task , rebin  the standard deviation of the signal for each bolometer in each observation",
    "was first calculated , the data were then rebinned onto a @xmath16 grid in ra / dec coordinates , and the standard deviations were used to create weighted signal and weighted noise maps .",
    "these maps were subsequently smoothed with a @xmath17 ( at 850  @xmath12 m ) or @xmath18 ( at 450  @xmath12 m ) gaussian .",
    "an @xmath19-band image of a @xmath20 region centered on the qso was taken at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) using the prime focus imaging camera on the night of 2003 may 28 .",
    "the total integration time was 3.7ks , the seeing was 1.0@xmath21 and the conditions were photometric .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf scripts and calibrated using landolt faint standards @xcite .",
    "the 5-@xmath14 limiting magnitude for a point - source in our @xmath22 aperture is @xmath23 .",
    "a @xmath24-band exposure of the central @xmath25 part of the field was obtained in photometric conditions with the ufti imager on the united kingdom infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) on 2003 may 24 .",
    "the total exposure time was 7.7ks in 0.6@xmath21 seeing yielding a 5-@xmath14 limiting magnitude of @xmath26 .",
    "the data were reduced using the orac - dr pipeline and the resulting mosaics combined with starlink ccdpack tasks .",
    "the data were calibrated with observations of the ukirt faint standard fs127 @xcite .",
    "galaxies were identified on the @xmath24-band frame using sextractor @xcite and total magnitudes estimated from best_mag .",
    "the positions were then used to measure colors within @xmath22 diameter apertures from the seeing - matched @xmath19/@xmath24 frames .",
    "the 450- and 850-@xmath12 m images reveal a remarkable structure of submillimeter sources in the field of the qso , particularly striking at 450@xmath12 m ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for the high redshift ( @xmath5 ) objects targeted to date @xcite ,",
    "the slightly different negative k - corrections that act on the 850- and 450-@xmath12 m flux densities have resulted in poor quality 450-@xmath12 m images .",
    "this is because , while the 850-@xmath12 m datum is shifted along the steep rayleigh - jeans tail of the dust emission , effectively canceling out the cosmological dimming , the 450-@xmath12 m datum is shifted close to the peak of this emission giving a marked fall - off of the flux density with redshift . in this respect ,",
    "the lower redshift of rxj094144.51 + 385434.8 has worked to our advantage , providing us with an image of the submillimeter dust emission with unprecedented resolution ( @xmath27 , equivalent to @xmath2870  kpc at @xmath0 ) .",
    "we identify six sources with peak signal - noise greater than 3 in the 450-@xmath12 m image ; they trace a ` chain ' of submillimeter galaxies with an extent of at least 400  kpc ( if at @xmath0 ) .",
    "source names , coordinates and physical quantities calculated from the images are presented in table  1 . at 450  @xmath12",
    "m the sources are well enough separated to allow good estimation of their individual flux densities ; this is not the case at 850@xmath12 m where we give combined flux densities for nos 1,2 ( the qso ) and 4,5 .",
    "quoted errors do not include the calibration uncertainties which are about 10% at 850  @xmath12 m and 1520% at 450  @xmath12 m .",
    "dust masses are calculated from the 450  @xmath12 m flux densities in the standard manner @xcite , adopting a value for the dust mass absorption coefficient @xmath29m@xmath30kg@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "far - infrared luminosities ( @xmath31 ) are calculated by scaling the 450  @xmath12 m emission with that of mrk  231 which has @xmath32 ( calculated from a grey - body fit to the far - infrared  millimeter sed - the fitted dust temperature is 42  k ) .",
    "using arp220 as a template reduces the @xmath31 estimates by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "the star - formation rates are calculated from sfr(m@xmath34/yr)@xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "each galaxy in this filament is itself a very massive ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) producing stars at a rate sufficient to build a massive spheroid in @xmath36 gyr .",
    "let us assess the significance of this structure .",
    "the density of 450-@xmath12 m sources in this field is 1.4@xmath370.6  arcmin@xmath38 , disregarding the qso which was already known to be a submillimeter source .",
    "the corresponding density of sources found in ` blank field ' surveys with 450-@xmath12 m flux densities in excess of 30 mjy is uncertain , but best estimates lie in the range",
    "@xmath39  arcmin@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "these figures thus imply an order of magnitude over - density of luminous star - forming galaxies in the @xmath40  arcmin@xmath38 field around rxj094144.51 + 385434.8 .",
    "we can investigate the statistical significance of this over - density by calculating the combined probability that these sources each exist at a distance , @xmath41 , from the qso given the expectation from the known surface density of blank field objects .",
    "the high end of the range given above , i.e. @xmath42  arcmin@xmath38 , gives the most pessimistic estimate of this probability ( given by @xmath43 for each source ) .",
    "we find @xmath44 that the structure we observe is a chance superposition of field objects ( @xmath45 if source 2 is excluded ) .",
    "this result provides very strong evidence that the companion galaxies lie at the same redshift and in the same structure as the qso . assuming this to be true",
    ", the star formation rate density calculated in a 500 kpc cube centered on this structure is @xmath46  m@xmath34  yr@xmath9mpc@xmath47 , about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than found in unbiased optical , infrared and submillimeter surveys @xcite .",
    "this field thus provides a striking demonstration of the filamentary distribution of forming galaxies in a high - density region at high redshift .",
    "can we find further support for the hierarchical model in our data ?",
    "in the high resolution 450-@xmath12 m image , the central qso and at least one of the spatially distinct submillimeter sources have complex morphologies , indicative of either merging or interacting systems .",
    "these characteristics are analogous to those observed in local ulirgs @xcite although these have more compact millimeter / submillimeter emission @xcite than observed here at higher redshift .",
    "moreover , these mergers must be occurring between similarly massive ( table  1 ) and gas rich systems , indicating that this activity is arising from major , rather than minor , mergers .",
    "images of the rxj094144.51 + 385434.8 field in the @xmath19- and @xmath24-band are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the submillimeter galaxies rxj094144smm3 , rxj094144smm4/5 and rxj094144smm6 all have counterparts identified as extremely red objects ( eros ) @xcite  defined as having @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "these objects are often found as counterparts to submillimeter galaxies discovered in blank field surveys @xcite .",
    "the counterpart of rxj094144smm6 is particularly interesting ; it has the appearance of an advanced merger and is a blue / red composite source , again similar to many counterparts of blank - field submillimeter galaxies @xcite .",
    "similar evidence for a merger origin of submillimeter galaxies has been seen in _",
    "observations which show them to be coincident with two or three x - ray sources  interpreted as obscured agn buried in merging star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "if the submillimeter - detected galaxies are proto - ellipticals then at @xmath49 they should contain growing black holes which shine as agn @xcite .",
    "however , the _ rosat _ data for this field show that the qso is the only luminous x - ray source amongst them .",
    "if the other dusty galaxies contain agn then they have to be of lower luminosity or more highly obscured or both .",
    "observations with the new generation of x - ray telescopes will allow us to probe the evolutionary state of the black holes in these systems @xcite .",
    "these images are the first to be made of a high redshift , x - ray absorbed qso at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the importance of these objects relative to their better studied x - ray unabsorbed ( or optically selected ) counterparts is only just becoming clear .",
    "for matched ( @xmath50 ) samples selected close to the break of the x - ray luminosity function , the latter are about one order of magnitude less luminous at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the most likely interpretation is that the x - ray absorption in these objects is not linked with orientation dependent obscuration - the ` unified scheme ' @xcite - but rather with the evolutionary state of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "our submillimeter images indicate that this is indeed the case for rxj094144.51 + 385434.8  its submillimeter luminosity appears to originate in large scale star formation associated with a major galaxy merger .",
    "finally , let us consider the fate of this structure .",
    "deep _ hst _ images of the fields around qsos @xcite suggest that their typical environments are galaxy clusters of abell richness class 0 @xcite . at the present day",
    "such clusters contain within their virial radius of order 10 galaxies with luminosity greater than or equal to l@xmath51 @xcite .",
    "if the 6 submillimeter luminous galaxies in the protocluster around rxj094144.51 + 385434.8 continue to form stars at the rates inferred from their submillimeter luminosities ( table  1 ) then their transformation into l@xmath51 ellipticals will be complete within in a fraction of a gyr .",
    "we can thus conclude that the coeval stellar populations of the luminous cluster galaxies will be in place by redshift 1.7 .",
    "their subsequent passive luminosity evolution will naturally result in a population of ellipticals with properties that match the core regions of today s rich galaxy clusters .",
