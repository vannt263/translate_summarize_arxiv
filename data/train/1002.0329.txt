    "we are entering exciting times in particle physics : the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is setting a new landmark at the high - energy frontier and probes , through the collision of multi - tev protons , the structure of matter and space - time at an unprecedented level .",
    "there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that the physics at the tev scale exploited at lhc will bring decisive insights into fundamental questions such as the origin of particle masses , the nature of dark matter in the universe , and the unification of all forces , including gravity .",
    "indeed , most proposals to embed the standard model of particle physics into a more general , unified framework , notably the ones based on string theory or its low energy incarnations , supergravity and supersymmetry , predict new heavy , @xmath0  gev , particles which may be searched for at tev colliders .",
    "some of these particles , prominent examples being neutralinos , are natural candidates for the constituents of cold dark matter in the form of so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )",
    ".    however , there is also evidence that there is fundamental physics at the sub - ev scale . indeed ,",
    "atmospheric , reactor , and solar neutrino data strongly support the hypothesis that neutrinos have masses in the sub - ev range .",
    "moreover , the vacuum energy density of the universe , as inferred from cosmological observations , points to the sub - ev range , @xmath1 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "many of the above mentioned extensions of the standard model not only predict wimps , but also wisps  very weakly interacting sub - ev particles .",
    "prominent candidates for such particles go under the names axions and axion - like particles , often arising as nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the breakdown of global symmetries .",
    "further wisp candidates are massless or light extra , hidden u(1 ) gauge bosons as well as light , chiral fermions charged under this hidden u(1 ) .",
    "these particles are frequently encountered in string embeddings of the standard model .",
    "the latter potentially contain also light moduli fields and light gravitinos as further wisp candidates .    unlike for wimps ,",
    "tev colliders are not the best means to search for wisps . for this purpose ,",
    "low energy experiments exploiting lasers , microwave cavities , strong electromagnetic fields , torsion balances etc .",
    "seem to be superior .",
    "it is the purpose of this review to present the physics case and a status report of this emerging low - energy frontier of fundamental physics .",
    "the organization of this review is as follows . in the following sect .",
    "[ physicscase ] we will argue that many extensions of the standard model predict new particles and phenomena at low energies . on the one hand new light particles are suggested to solve puzzling experimental results but on the other hand they also appear to be a generic feature of underlying fundamental theories such as string theory . in sect .",
    "[ astro ] we will turn to current constraints from astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "moreover , we will discuss a few interesting observations that could be explained by invoking wisps .",
    "then , in sect .  [ searches ] , we will explore how wisps can be searched for in a variety of controlled laboratory experiments .",
    "we discuss the advantages of these experiments as well as the challenges they face . finally in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] we will summarize the current situation and give an outlook towards the future .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the non - abelian gauge theory describing strong interactions , allows for a cp - violating term in the lagrangian , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gluonic field strength .",
    "similar to the strong coupling constant @xmath4 , the fundamental parameter @xmath5 has to be determined experimentally .",
    "one of the most sensitive probes for it is the electric dipole moment of the neutron , arising from the cp - violating term given in eq .",
    "( [ topterm ] ) .",
    "it should be of order @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the neutron ( a light - quark mass ) , @xmath9 is the unit electric charge , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the quark mass matrix .",
    "@xmath12 is the actual physical cp - violating parameter in the standard model .",
    "the current experimental upper bound on @xmath13 cm  @xcite places an extremely stringent limit on @xmath14 the strong cp problem is the lack of an explanation why the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 , a sum of two contribution of very different origins , is so unnaturally small .",
    "the axion occurs in course of a possible solution of this problem .",
    "in essence , the proposal of peccei and quinn  @xcite was to promote @xmath5 to a dynamical field which can relax spontaneously to zero .",
    "the axion field @xmath16 is introduced as a dynamical @xmath5 parameter , which has a shift symmetry , @xmath17 broken only by the anomalous cp - violating terms , i.e. its low - energy effective lagrangian is parametrized as @xmath18 , \\label{axion_leff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a model dependent parameter , @xmath20 is the electromagnetic field strength , and @xmath21 denotes generic standard model fields .",
    "the dimensionful axion decay constant @xmath22 determines the strength of the interaction of the axion with the standard model particles .",
    "the @xmath5-term in the qcd lagrangian can then be eliminated by absorbing it into the axion field , @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the topological charge density @xmath24 , induced by topological fluctuations of the gluon fields such as qcd instantons , provides a nontrivial potential for the axion field",
    "@xmath25 which is minimized at zero expectation value , @xmath26 : thus , the @xmath12 dependence is wiped out by the axion field , providing a natural explanation why the electric dipole moment of the neutron is so small . the nontrivial potential around @xmath26",
    "promotes the elementary particle excitation of the axion field , the axion , to a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite ( which we will now again denote by @xmath16 ) with a non - vanishing , but parametrically small mass .",
    "this mass can be calculated via current algebra and expressed in terms of the light ( @xmath27 ) quark masses , the pion mass @xmath28 and the pion decay constant @xmath29  @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) , @xmath30 for large axion decay constant @xmath22 , we see that the axion is a prime example for a wisp  @xcite : it is a very weakly interacting ( cf .",

    "in particular , its coupling to photons , which for an axion , like for any other pseudo - scalar , should be of the form , @xmath31 is very much suppressed  @xcite , @xmath32    although expected to be small , the guaranteed coupling of axions to photons , eq .",
    "( [ axionphotoncoupling ] ) , may result , if axions exist , in observable consequences from processes involving large electromagnetic fields .",
    "these often occur in astrophysical and cosmological environments ( cf .",
    "[ astro ] ) and can be prepared in laboratory experiments ( cf .",
    ".  [ searches ] ) .",
    "the proposal of an anomalous peccei - quinn shift symmetry is motivated to provide for a solution of the strong cp problem .",
    "this concept has been generalized to other similar wisp candidates  axion - like particles ( alps )  which may arise as ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone bosons from the breaking of other global symmetries such as , for example , family symmetries",
    ". however , in contrast to axions , for generic alps a non - zero coupling @xmath33 to photons is not guaranteed .",
    "moreover , for them a predictive relation between @xmath33 and the mass is missing .",
    "correspondingly , alp searches , exploiting their interactions with photons , should try to cover the entire parameter space spanned by @xmath33 and the mass of the alp and not only the restricted parameter space , eqs .",
    "( [ axionmass ] ) and ( [ axionphotoncoupling ] ) , predicted for axions .",
    "the existence of axions and alps can also be strongly motivated from a top - down point of view .",
    "in fact , when compactifying the six extra spatial dimensions of string theory they arise quite naturally as kaluza - klein zero modes of antisymmetric tensor fields , which are generically present in all string theories . moreover , the ( chern - simons ) couplings of these form fields to the gauge fields , which are crucially determined by anomaly cancelation conditions , result in the anomalous cp violating couplings in the low - energy effective lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ axion_leff ] ) , necessary for the solution of the strong cp problem .",
    "thus , string compactifications suggest plenty of candidates for axions and axion - like wisps  @xcite .",

    "only the ones which escape these mechanisms are wisp candidates .    in the compactification of the",

    "correspondingly , their properties depend much more on the details of the compactification .",
    "nevertheless , a recent exhaustive study has elucidated  @xcite that also in this case the axion decay constant can not be smaller than @xmath52  gev .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn for the axions in strongly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite .",
    "these findings can be easily understood physically : it is the string scale @xmath53 which mainly determines the axion decay constant  @xcite . and in the heterotic case , this scale is large , e.g. @xmath54 , for the weakly coupled heterotic string ( cf .",
    "( [ heterotic_couplings ] ) )",
    ".        this may be different in compactifications of type ii string theories which give rise to  intersecting brane worlds \" .",
    "in these theories , the standard model lives on a stack of d@xmath55-branes which are extended along the 3 + 1 non - compact dimensions and wrap @xmath56-dimensional topologically non - trivial submanifolds in the compactification manifold , while gravity propagates in the bulk , leading to a possibly smaller string scale at the expense of a larger compactification volume , @xmath57 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : type_ii_comp ] ) . in type ii string theory ,",
    "the axions come from the massless excitations of the ( ramond - ramond ) @xmath56-form gauge field @xmath58 .",
    "the precise predictions depend on the particular embedding of the standard model , but generically one finds that the axion decay constant can be substantially lower than in the heterotic case , varying between  @xcite @xmath59 corresponding to a variation of the string scale between the tev and the gut scale .",
    "apart from possibly light pseudoscalars , string compactifications generically also predict scalar particles  the dilaton and large numbers of moduli  which appear also massless at the compactification scale .",
    "essentially massless scalar fields are also often invoked by cosmologists in the context of dark energy .",
    "in fact , a plausible explanation for the apparent acceleration of the cosmic expansion rate of the universe is provided by the presence of a spatially homogeneous scalar field which is rolling down a very flat potential  @xcite .",
    "interactions of very light scalar fields with ordinary matter are strongly constrained by the non - observation of  fifth force \" effects leading to _ e.g. _  violations of the equivalence principle ( cf .",
    "[ sec : fifth_force ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , if such particles exist , the forces mediated by them should be either much weaker than gravity or short - ranged in the laboratory .",
    "the latter occurs in theories where the mass of the scalar field depends effectively on the local density of matter  in so - called chameleon field theories  @xcite .",
    "depending on the non - linear field self - interactions and on the interactions with the ambient matter , the chameleon may have a large mass in regions of high density ( like the earth ) , while it has a small mass in regions of low density ( like interstellar space ) .",
    "since such particles are able to hide so well from observations and experiments , they have been named  chameleons \" .",
    "similar to axions and axion - like particles , additional hidden sector u(1 ) gauge bosons are also a generic feature arising in string compactifications .",
    "these are therefore well motivated wisp candidates .",
    "in fact , in the standard compactification of the @xmath40 supergravity based on the heterotic string on a smooth ( calabi - yau ) manifold , the standard model gauge group is embedded in the first @xmath60 factor , whereas the second @xmath60 factor comprises a  hidden gauge group \" , which interacts with the first @xmath60 factor only gravitationally  @xcite . this second @xmath60 factor may be broken in the course of compactification to products of non - abelian and u(1 ) gauge groups .",
    "the occurrence of hidden u(1)s can be studied quite exhaustively in toroidal orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string , which allow for a systematic scanning of possible gauge group factors and particles after compactification . requiring a realistic visible sector",

    "@xcite , @xmath61 .\\ ] ]    compactifications of type ii string theory also suggest the existence of hidden u(1)s , be it as kaluza - klein zero modes of the previously mentioned ( ramond - ramond ) form fields or as massless excitations of branes .",
    "in fact , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : type_ii_comp ] , type ii compactifications generically involve space - time filling hidden sector branes not intersecting with the standard model branes , often also for global consistency requirements .",
    "some of these hidden u(1)s may remain unbroken down to very small energy scales . in this case",
    "their dominant interaction with the photon , which is encoded in the low - energy effective lagrangian , @xmath62 with @xmath63 denoting the hidden u(1 ) field with field strength @xmath64 and gauge coupling @xmath65 , will be through kinetic mixing  @xcite , with mixing parameter @xmath66 . therefore ,",
    "light hidden u(1)s (  hidden photons \" ) are well motivated wisp candidates , since @xmath66 is expected to be small .",
    "in fact , kinetic mixing is generated at one - loop by the exchange of heavy messengers that couple both to the visible u(1 ) as well as to the hidden u(1 ) . in the context of compactifications of the heterotic string",
    ", its size has been estimated as  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68  gev is the possible range of mass splitting in the messenger sector once supersymmetry is broken .",
    "a great variety for possible values of @xmath66 can also be accommodated in type ii compactifications for the mixing between brane - localized hidden u(1)s and the visible u(1 ) . here",
    ", kinetic mixing can be understood as originating from the exchange of closed strings through the bulk  @xcite .",
    "generically , one finds  @xcite @xmath69 where the size of the hidden sector gauge coupling @xmath70 depends on the @xmath56-dimensional volume ( @xmath71 ) of the cycle which the hidden brane wraps , @xmath72 leading to a quite large range of possible values for the kinetic mixing , @xmath73 for the string scale varying between a tev scale and the gut scale .",
    "smaller values of kinetic mixing can be obtained in these setups in special cases where the one - loop contribution is cancelled or vanishes . moreover , exponentially suppressed values can be naturally obtained in flux compactifications with warped throats  @xcite .",
    "masses for the hidden photons can arise via the standard higgs mechanism but also via a stueckelberg mechanism . in large volume compactifications",
    "small , even sub - ev , masses arise quite naturally  @xcite .",
    "if the masses arise from a stueckelberg mechanism , mass and size of the kinetic mixing are typically linked through one scale , the string scale , and therefore related to each other .",
    "depending on the specific way in which the cycles wrap the singularities one obtains expressions for the masses like @xmath74 for example in the case @xmath75 we obtain for a string scale of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and , from eqs .",
    ", , a mixing of @xmath78 .    the predictions for masses arising from the higgs mechanism are less precise , however , they can also be tiny , if the supersymmetry breaking scale in the hidden sector is much smaller than in the visible sector .    occasionally , there is also light hidden matter charged under the hidden u(1)s .",
    "after diagonalization of the gauge kinetic terms by a shift @xmath79 and a multiplicative hypercharge renormalization , one observes that the hidden sector particles acquire a minihypercharge @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "in particular , also an eventual hidden higgs particle may be searched for by exploiting its effective minihypercharge  @xcite . in a similar way",
    "minicharged particles can also arise from hidden sector magnetic monopoles if the gauge fields mix via a non - diagonal @xmath5-term  @xcite .",
    "therefore , light minicharged particles ( mcps ) are also very well motivated wisp candidates .",
    "as we have reviewed in the last section , there is a strong physics case for the possible existence of wisps .",
    "moreover , their possible masses and couplings span a very wide range in parameter space .",
    "correspondingly , searches for signatures of wisps have to exploit a wide variety of observational and experimental techniques , ranging from cosmology and astrophysics to terrestrial laboratory experiments .",
    "as reviewed in this section , the strongest bounds on the existence of wisps presently often come from stellar evolution and cosmology , where to the best of our knowledge observations seem to agree with the standard budget of elementary particles .",

    "production of wisps in stars would substantially affect stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "wisps are only rarely produced in the dense plasmas of stellar interiors , but they will easily escape , contributing directly to the total energy loss of the star .",

    "in fact , for very weak coupling , i.e. large decay constant @xmath22 , the ultra - light axions are produced non - thermally in the early universe . at early times , at temperatures well above the qcd phase transition , the axion is effectively massless and the corresponding field can take any value , parameterized by the  misalignment angle \" @xmath118 .",
    "later , as the temperature of the primordial plasma falls below the hadronic scale , @xmath119  gev , the axion develops its mass @xmath120 due to non - perturbative ( topological instanton ) effects .",
    "when the mass @xmath120 becomes of order the hubble expansion rate , the axion field will start to oscillate around its mean value @xmath121 .",
    "these coherent and spatially uniform oscillations correspond to a coherent state of non - relativistic axion particles , whose contribution to today s energy density , in terms of the critical energy density , can be estimated as  @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath123  few",
    ". therefore , for generic values of the misalignment angle , @xmath124 , the axion could be the main constituent of cdm in the universe , @xmath125 , if its decay constant is of order @xmath126  gev , corresponding to a mass in the @xmath127ev range .",
    "larger values of @xmath22 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : axions_astro ] ( top ) ; labeled  cdm \" ) are excluded because they would lead to an overclosure of the universe .",
    "however , if the initial @xmath118 is small , values of @xmath22 near the gut or planck scale are still possible .",
    "this could be due to a finetuning but also due to anthropic selection  @xcite .",
    "axion dark matter may indeed explain two additional puzzling observations : firstly there is an interesting alignment in the multipoles of the cmb anisotropies  @xcite and secondly the rotational curves of a number of galaxies provides evidence for an additional structure in the galactic halo , so - called caustic rings  @xcite .",
    "both observations may be explained by bose - einstein condensation of dark matter axions  @xcite .    finally , in the context of dark matter it should be noted that axions could also contribute a hot dark matter component . as for neutrinos",
    "the fraction of this hot dark matter is proportional to the mass of the axion .",
    "recent constraints on the size of a possible hot dark matter component provide a bound of @xmath128 ( see fig .",

    "but , apart from the obvious possibility that a more conventional explanation may be found for this non - standard energy loss , it should be noted that this could also be explained in terms of hidden photons coupling via non - renormalizable operators to electrons , cf .",

    "fortunately , as we will see in the next section , this region of parameter space is not completely off the possibilities to be checked in a controlled laboratory experiment based on photon regeneration .",
    "it has been argued that recent observations in tev gamma astronomy may point towards the existence of alps or at least will help to give sensible new constraints on their existence .",
    "quite distant astrophysical sources have been observed in tev gamma rays by h.e.s.s . and",
    "this appeared to be quite puzzling , since the gamma ray absorption rate due to electron / positron pair production off the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) was believed to be too strong to allow for their observation  @xcite .",
    "clearly , a conventional explanation is either that the ebl is less dense than expected and/or that the source spectra are harder as previously thought .",
    "alternatively , such a high transparency of the universe may also be explained by the conversion of gamma rays into alps in the magnetic fields around the gamma ray sources .",
    "these alps would travel then unimpeded until they reach our galaxy and reconvert into photons in the galactic magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the conversion / reconversion could take place in the intergalactic magnetic fields  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive bibliography and the current status ) .",
    "the intergalactic magnetic fields are not well known but the assumption of being organized in randomly oriented patches would produce a characteristic scatter in luminosity relations . a powerful signature of cosmic photon regeneration could therefore emerge if the reconstructed ebl along different lines of sight towards different tev gamma sources were to display such a characteristic scatter  @xcite .",
    "alps may also leave their imprints in luminosity relations of active galactic nuclei .",
    "in fact , mixing between photons and alps in the random magnetic fields in galaxy clusters may induce a characteristic scatter in the relations of x - ray vs. optical luminosities of compact sources in these clusters .",
    "evidence for such an effect has recently been found in an analysis of luminosity relations of about two hundred active galactic nuclei , providing a strong hint for the possible existence of a very light axion - like particle  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , photon - alp mixing could also explain the puzzling origin of the ( debated ) correlation of arrival directions of ultra high energy cosmic rays and bl - lac objects observed by agasa and hires  @xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "moreover , the observed alignment of the polarization vectors of very distant quasars may also be explained by selective photon disappearance from photon - alp oscillations  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is also worth nothing that very similar alps have been invoked to solve some problematic aspects of the x - ray activity of the sun , the longstanding corona problem and the triggering of solar flares  @xcite .",

    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ lswresult ] .",
    "the bounds are in the @xmath168 range for alps and the kinetic mixing and minicharges probed are typically of the order of @xmath169 .",
    "although , this is not yet competitive with the astrophysical and cosmological arguments  except for the case of hidden photons in the mev mass range ( cf .",
    "[ lswresult ] ( c ) )  it should be noted that these bounds are less model - dependent ( cf .",

    "using cavities on both sides  @xcite could lead to significant improvements in the near future .",
    "however , it should be noted that this presents a technological challenge  @xcite because the cavities have to be tuned to be resonant with each other ( and , of course , a better quality of the cavity reduces the bandwidth making this even more difficult ) .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that this methods paves the way to beat for the first time the astrophysical bound on the alp - photon coupling .",
    "moreover , it can even reach the alp benchmark point ( [ g_benchmark_alp_transp ] ) , @xmath170  gev@xmath171 , for small enough alp mass , therefore possibly testing the alp interpretation of the reported hints of cosmic photon regeneration ( cf . sect .",
    "[ sec : hints_cosmic ] ) . in order to probe the axion benchmark point ( [ fa_benchmark_axion_wd ] )",
    ", however , one needs further ingredients in order to access also higher masses : one possibility is to exploit alternating magnetic field directions  @xcite , another is to use phase shift plates  @xcite .",
    "higher masses could also be accessed by exploiting kev photons from x - ray free - electron lasers or synchrotron radiation sources  @xcite . however , presently the photon fluxes from these sources appear to be too small to be competitive with optical photons .",
    "further improvement in the sensitivity at low masses could also come from experiments that employ electromagnetic waves in the radiofrequency range instead of laser light in the visible regime  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such `` microwave shining through walls '' is threefold .",
    "first , microwave cavities can be constructed such that the light is effectively reflected back and forth inside the cavities up to @xmath172 times .",
    "this allows for a significant improvement compared to the currently best optical cavities where the light can be reflected only up to @xmath173 times .",
    "second , although still a technological challenge the tuning of the cavities to resonance is simplified by the fact that extremely frequency - stable cavities exist in the microwave regime . finally , using the phase information of the generator to distinguish between signal and background one can detect microwaves with intensities less than @xmath174 with commercially available technology . with currently available technology , sensitivities of the order @xmath175 seem achievable .",
    "the price to pay is that due to the lower frequency / energy of the microwaves , the sensitive range is typically restricted to particle masses less than @xmath176 .",
    "several of these experiments are currently under construction or in planning stages  @xcite .",
    "finally another variant of the lsw idea is to use static magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the setup consists of a highly sensitive magnetometer inside a superconducting shielding .",
    "this is then placed inside a strong ( but sub - critical ) magnetic field . in ordinary electrodynamics",
    "the magnetic field can not permeate the superconductor and no field should register on the magnetometer . however , photon  hidden - sector photon ",
    "photon oscillations would allow to penetrate the superconductor and the magnetic field would  leak \" into the shielded volume and register on the magnetometer .",
    "compared to the classic lsw setup there are two crucial differences . first , the fields are ( nearly ) static and the photons involved are virtual .",
    "second , the magnetometer directly measures the field - strength and not a probability .",
    "correspondingly , the signal is suppressed only quadratically , @xmath177 , instead of quartically . for hidden photon masses in the range 0.002 - 200 mev",
    "the projected sensitivity for the mixing parameter lies in the @xmath178 to @xmath179 range .      for chameleon particles ( s. sect .",
    "[ chameleonsect ] ) and in general particles whose mass increases with the local matter / energy density  @xcite , lsw experiments do not always work .",
    "the reason is that the high ( compared to the vacuum ) density inside the wall increases the mass of the produced wisp and therefore creates a high potential barrier on which the particle is reflected .",
    "however , this reflection can actually be used in a slightly different type of experiment  @xcite .",
    "if the production zone is enclosed by suitably dense walls on all sides ( transparent windows let the photons into the production zone but they are typically too dense to let chameleons escape ) the chameleons produced are trapped inside the production zone and accumulate over time . after some time the laser is switched off .",
    "now the accumulated chameleons can reconvert into photons which escape through the windows .",
    "hence , there is an `` afterglow '' after the laser has been switched off .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "such an experiment has been performed by the gammev collaboration  @xcite and allows to exclude sub - mev ( vacuum mass ) chameleons with couplings in the range @xmath180 .",
    "improvements planned by the gammev collaboration  @xcite will further increase the sensitivity .",
    "moreover , by driving the admx cavity with an external generator and looking for a `` microwave afterglow '' the admx collaboration has performed a small test experiment for chameleons with masses around @xmath181ev  @xcite .      as already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ stellar ] wisps can also be produced inside the sun .",
    "this can either occur via the same interactions that lead to the oscillation phenomena described above or via additional derivative interactions with matter ( e.g. for axions ) . in any case due to the high number of photons inside the sun and the high total number of interactions ,",
    "this typically would lead to the production of a huge number of wisps .",
    "helioscopes try to detect these wisps on earth  @xcite .",
    "basically helioscopes employ the same idea as an lsw experiment . however , the production side is replaced by the wisp production inside the sun .",
    "the regeneration side is the same as for a completely laboratory based lsw experiment with the detector pointing towards the sun .",
    "the wall is simply everything in between the solar core and the regeneration side ( the rest of the sun , the atmosphere , the walls of the experimental hall etc . ) .",
    "the enormous total number of interactions inside the sun leads to a large wisp flux even if the coupling is tiny .",
    "this make helioscopes an extremely powerful tool to search for wisps , however , the same caveats discussed in sect .",
    "[ stellar ] apply : if somehow the production of wisps inside the sun is suppressed , helioscopes loose their sensitivity .",
    "the typical energy of photons inside the sun is in the kev range , accordingly this is also the typical energy of wisps produced inside the sun .",
    "currently two axion helioscopes are running , cast and sumico  @xcite .",
    "the two experiments employ large magnets .",
    "therefore , they are sensitive to alps as well as hidden photons ( with and without additional mcps ) .",
    "both experiments have performed searches for wisps with kev energies leading to x - ray photons inside the detector .",
    "in addition , cast has also searched for wisps in the ev regime  @xcite which gives weaker but less model dependent constraints on wisps ( cf .",

    "alternatively , one could also replace the sun as the source of axions with other cosmic sources  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us turn to another type of photon regeneration experiment that employs an external source of wisps : axion dark matter searches .",
    "as the name suggests these experiments are mainly focussed on axions .    as described in sect .",
    "[ axiondm ] axions are produced in the early universe and can form all or part of the dark matter .",
    "one can now place the regeneration side of an lsw experiment ( with magnet ) on earth and wait for dark matter axions to enter the experiment and be converted into photons .",
    "this is the basic idea of an axion dark matter experiment also called axion haloscope  @xcite . in principle",
    "this type of experiment is also sensitive to other types of wisps such as hidden photons .",
    "however , due to their different production mechanisms these typically can only form a small part of the dark matter ( which itself puts a constraint on their existence ) which , in addition is typically rather hot , somewhat limiting the sensitivity of haloscope searches for non - axion wisps .",
    "( but a final analysis is still outstanding . )    the admx  @xcite and carrack  @xcite collaborations are currently operating axion haloscopes . since the typical masses / energies expected for axion dark matter lie in the @xmath182ev range this experiment uses microwave cavities for resonant regeneration ( cf .",
    "[ lswexperiments ] ) . since",
    "dark matter axions are very cold , i.e. their kinetic energy is very small compared to their mass , the energy of the regenerated photons is basically given by the axion mass . to achieve resonant regeneration the axion mass therefore has to lie within the bandwidth of the microwave cavities .",
    "since the axion mass is unknown such an experiment scans through a range of masses by changing the resonance frequency of the cavity .",
    "all in all , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : axions_astro ] , admx achieves enormous sensitivity but currently only for a relatively limited range of axion masses . yet",

    "it should be noted , however , that regeneration experiments for dark matter axions work only in presence of a background of axions .",
    "usually , the latter is assumed to be of the size of the local dark matter density and the admx bound given in fig .",
    "[ fig : axions_astro ] is obtained under this assumption .    as an alternative to a microwave cavity experiment",
    "one could also search for dark matter axions using optical cavities filled with laser light .",
    "photons absorbing dark matter axions would lead to sidebands in the spectrum of the laser light  @xcite .    at very small masses ( in the finetuning or anthropic region where the initial value of the axion field needs to be small ( cf .",

    "the experiments described in the previous section search for regenerated photons as a signature of wisps .",
    "an alternative is to search for the _ disappearance _ or phase modifications of photons that would signify the real and virtual production of wisps  @xcite .",
    "this idea is realized in laser polarization experiments . in these experiments ( linearly )",
    "polarized laser light is shone through a magnetic field and changes in the polarization are searched for .",
    "the detectable changes are a rotation of the linearly polarized light and also a phase shift between different polarization directions that modifies linear polarized light into elliptically polarized light .",
    "however , changes in the overall magnitude of the laser field are typically not detectable .    as an example",
    "the relevant processes for alps and minicharged particles are depicted in fig .",
    "[ polarization ] .    to calculate the relevant changes in phase and amplitude one can use the same equations of motion as in the previous subsection . instead of the photon to wisp transition",
    "amplitude the relevant quantity is now the photon to photon amplitude and the corresponding probability @xmath185 .",
    "note that in order to obtain an observable effect the changes in the amplitude and phase of the photons must be different for the different polarizations since changes in the overall magnitude of the laser field are not detectable .",

    "currently a variety of these experiments have already finished data taking , are running , in construction or in preparation  @xcite .",
    "although their basic principle is the same they differ in that they use pulsed or constant lasers and or magnetic fields .    the polarization experiments described in this section typically only measure the difference in the speed of light between the two polarization directions . however , using an interferometer where one arm is placed in a magnetic field allows to measure the change in the speed of light for both polarizations individually .",
    "one interesting possibility for this is to equip one arm of a gravitational wave detector with pulsed magnetic fields  @xcite .    in an inhomogeneous magnetic field axions",
    "would cause one polarization direction of the laser beam to be split into two parts ( similar to a stern - gerlach experiment ) .",
    "potentially this could also be exploited experimentally to search for axions  @xcite .",
    "so far we have described the propagation of light using linear equations of motion .",
    "all ( possibly non - linear ) effects of background fields were included in effective mass matrices that lead to small modifications of the propagation in vacuum .",
    "however , in strong electromagnetic fields non - linear quantum effects can lead to entirely new processes such as , e.g. schwinger pair production  @xcite . in presence of light particles interacting with the electromagnetic field",
    "these effects may set in at much smaller fields than in ordinary qed where the critical field strength for such effects is set by the electron mass @xmath190 .",
    "this can be used to search for wisps . as an example",
    "let us consider how minicharged particles can be searched for using schwinger pair production .",
    "the basic setup @xcite is depicted in fig .",
    "[ acdc ] . in a strong electric field",
    "a vacuum pair of charged particles gains energy if the particles are separated by a distance along the lines of the electric field .",
    "if the electric field is strong enough ( or the distance large enough ) the energy gain can overcome the rest mass , i.e. the virtual particles turn into real particles .",
    "this is the famous schwinger pair production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "after their production the electric field accelerates the particles and antiparticles according to their charge in opposite directions .",
    "this leads to an electric current ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ acdc ] ) .",
    "if the current is made up of minicharged particles the individual particles have very small charges and interact only very weakly with ordinary matter . therefore , they can pass even through thick walls nearly unhindered .",
    "an electron current , however , would be stopped .",
    "after passage through the wall we can then place an ampere meter to detect the minicharged particle current .",
    "typical accelerator cavities achieve field strengths of @xmath191 and their size is typically of the order of tens of centimeters .",
    "precision ampere meters can certainly measure currents as small as @xmath192 and even smaller currents of the order of @xmath193 seem feasible . using the schwinger pair production rate we",
    "can then estimate the expected sensitivity for such an experiment to be @xmath194 therefore such an experiment has the potential for significant improvement over the currently best laboratory bounds  @xcite , @xmath195 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mcp_astro ] ) .",
    "some of the wisp candidates discussed here , such as scalar alps or hidden photons , mediate long range forces between macroscopic bodies .",
    "therefore , on account of the cumulative effect of a macroscopic amount of particles , experiments testing the inverse square law of the newton and coulomb forces offer very sensititve probes of wisps in a certain mass range  @xcite .",
    "note , that in our discussions of fifth forces we concentrate on wisps that interact with photons .",
    "however , searches for non - newtonian forces are also sensitive to a whole variety of wisps that interact gravitationally or with very weak ( effective ) yukawa interactions .",

    "for particle physicists the term `` low energy physics '' is usually used for physics below the current high energy frontier , today roughly the electroweak scale @xmath205 .",
    "currently , three areas of `` low energy physics '' are proving to be fruitful grounds to explore fundamental physics .",
    "first there are experiments just below the electroweak scale , in the regime of roughly @xmath206-@xmath207 .",
    "this energy range is particularly interesting for high precision flavor physics but it could also provide insight into so - called `` dark forces '' that have recently attracted a lot of attention in order to resolve puzzling astrophysical observations ( cf .",
    "[ sec : dm_hidden ] ) .",
    "the second area of interest is to use low energy experiments and observations to test fundamental symmetries , such as e.g. lorentz symmetry , to an incredibly high precision ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that there exist new particles with very small masses ( possibly even sub - ev ) but also very weak interactions with the known standard model particles .",
    "this is the case discussed in this review .",
    "light weakly coupled particles with masses below an ev , so - called weakly interacting sub - ev particles ( wisps ) , are strongly motivated both from top down as well as from bottom - up considerations .",
    "a classic example for a wisp is the axion ( cf .",
    "[ sec : qcd_axion ] ) . from a bottom - up point of view",
    "the axion is predicted as a consequence of the peccei - quinn solution of the strong cp problem .",
    "a new global symmetry is introduced which is spontaneously broken at a very high energy scale @xmath208 . as a consequence , the axion as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of this symmetry has both small mass , @xmath209 , and coupling to two photons , @xmath210 .",
    "taking , on the other hand , a top - down approach , in string theory particles with couplings similar to axions , axion - like particles , seem to be a natural consequence of the compactification of extra dimensions ( cf .",
    "[ sec : axions_string ] ) .",
    "again , their small couplings arise from the large energy scales involved , the string scale ( possibly also the sizes of the extra dimensions ) .",
    "searching for such particles is thereby a way to probe very high energy scales far beyond the energy scale in colliders such as lhc .",
    "axions are by far not the only possible wisp candidates .",
    "string models often contain also additional u(1 ) gauge groups and matter charged under them ( cf .",
    "[ sec : hidden_string ] ) .",
    "the corresponding extra `` hidden '' photons can mix kinetically with the ordinary electromagnetic photon .",
    "small mixing angles and corresponding small interactions with ordinary matter arise from high energy scales involved and from the fact that the additional gauge factors are  far away \" in the extra dimensions .",
    "roughly speaking probing small couplings allows us look beyond our immediate neighborhood and probe the global structure of the compactification .",
    "for extra photons ( and matter charged under them ) small masses are possible but not necessary .",
    "astrophysics and cosmology already provide a powerful tool to constrain wisps and in many regions of parameter space this sets the standard against which laboratory tests have to measure up ( cf .",
    "[ astro ] ) .",
    "the rapidly increasing amount of available data will hopefully further improve the situation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    beyond this",
    "some astrophysical and cosmological observations even provide suggestive hints for the existence of wisps ( cf .",
    "[ hints ] ) .",
    "importantly , both axions as well as hidden photons ( or particles related to them ) may contribute all or part of the dark matter .",
    "in addition to the above there is a number of astrophysical puzzles that can be solved by the presence of wisps such as , e.g. , the possible observations of high and very high energy cosmic photon regeneration , the observed alignment of the polarization vectors of very distant quasars , the energy loss of white dwarfs , and a slight excess in the effective number of neutrino species in the cmb measurements .",
    "these interpretations can and should be tested in the laboratory .",
    "one of the most important features of the wisps described above is that they have ( very weak ) interactions with photons . in combination with their small mass",
    "this allows to search for them in photon regeneration experiments , in laser polarisation experiments , in experiments exploiting strong electromagnetic fields , and also in fifth force experiments .",
    "currently , considerable activity takes place in the field of laser light shining through a wall experiments ( cf . sect .",
    "[ lswexperiments ] ) , which is now entering a new generation .",
    "important advances in laser technology appear to pave the way to beat the sensitivity of current wisp helioscopes and to probe the above mentioned explanations of astrophysical puzzles in terms of photon @xmath211 wisp oscillations .",
    "pioneering experiments exploiting instead high - quality microwave cavities for the generation and regeneration of wisps are in the commissioning phase .",
    "the microwave cavity search for dark matter axions probes a complementary region in parameter space compared to the other photon regeneration experiments and should provide a definitive answer whether axions are the dominant part of cold dark matter within the current decade .",
    "laser polarisation experiments ( cf . sect .",
    "[ laserpolarisation ] ) will continue their quest to detect the qed birefringence . at the same time they will also considerably improve the bounds they place on wisps .",
    "they will also further help to develop the optical techniques , such as cavities that are used in light shining through a wall experiments .",
    "moreover , experiments analyzing the spectrum of laser light in an interferometer also seem to be a promising tool to search for dark matter axions .",
    "fifth force experiments ( cf . sect .",
    "[ sec : fifth_force ] ) , in particular searches for deviations from the gravitational inverse square law are already an established tool to test fundamental physics which will continue to improve significantly , thereby providing new bounds on a variety of wisps , in particular light scalar fields .",
    "other wisps such as hidden photons and minicharged partcles can be probed with high sensitivities by testing for deviations from coulomb s law .",
    "although tests of coulomb s law are already at an impressive precision the currently best available bounds in the length range of meters are nearly 40 years old .",
    "it stands to hope that with current technology considerable improvements are possible .",
    "all in all using low energy experiments with photons to search for wisps may give important information about fundamental particle physics complementary to the one obtainable at high energy colliders .",
    "already today these experiments provide very strong bounds on light weakly interacting particles .",
    "but even more excitingly the next few years are likely to bring considerable advances and huge discovery potential for new physics .",
