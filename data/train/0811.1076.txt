    "to shape the beam so that it matches the characteristics of the specific treatment in radiation therapy ( thus achieving the delivery of the prescribed dose to the target ( tumour ) and maximal protection of the surrounding healthy tissue and vital organs ) , beam - limiting and beam - shaping devices ( bl / bsds ) are routinely used .",
    "generally speaking , the beam is first restricted ( in size ) by the primary collimator , a beam - limiting device giving it a rectangular shape .",
    "the beam may subsequently encounter the multi - leaf collimator ( mlc ) , which may be static or dynamic ( i.e. , undergoing software - controlled motion during the treatment session ) .",
    "more frequently than not , the desirable beam shaping is achieved by inserting a metallic piece ( with the appropriate aperture and thickness ) into the beamline , directly in front of the patient ; this last beam - shaping device is called a patient collimator or simply a block .",
    "being positioned close to the patient , the block achieves efficient fall - off of the dose ( sharp penumbra ) outside the target area .",
    "( the simultaneous use of mlc and block is not common . )    to provide efficient attenuation of the beam outside the irradiated volume , the bl / bsds are made of high-@xmath1 materials .",
    "the primary collimator and the mlc are fixed parts of the treatment machine , whereas the block not only depends on the particular patient , but also on the direction from which the target is irradiated .",
    "therefore , there may be several blocks in one treatment plan , not necessarily corresponding to the same thickness or ( perhaps ) material .",
    "the presence of bl / bsds in treatment plans induces three types of physical effects :    * \\a ) confinement of the beam to the area corresponding to full transmission ( i.e. , to the aperture of the device ) . *",
    "\\b ) effects associated with the nonzero thickness of the device ( geometrical effects ) . *",
    "\\c ) effects relating to the scattering of the beam off the material of the device .",
    "type-(a ) effects ( direct blocking of the beam ) are dominant and have always been taken into account .",
    "the standard way to do this is by reducing the bl / bsd into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) object ( i.e. , by disregarding its thickness ) and assuming no transmission of the beam outside its aperture .",
    "type-(b ) and type-(c ) effects induce corrections which , albeit at a few - percent level of the prescribed dose , may represent a sizable fraction of the _ local _ dose ; due to their complexity and to time restrictions during the planning phase , these corrections have ( so far ) been omitted in clinical applications .",
    "the subject of the slit scattering in beam collimation was first addressed by courant ( 1951 ) .",
    "courant extracted analytical solutions for the effective increase in the slit width ( attributable to scattering ) by solving the diffusion equation inside the collimator . to fulfill the boundary conditions , he introduced the negative - image technique , which was later criticised ( e.g. , by burge and smith ( 1962 ) ) . despite the debatable usefulness of the practical use of courant s work , that article set forth definitions which were employed in future research ; for example , by categorising the scattered particles as :    * those impinging upon the upstream face of the collimator and emerging from its inner surface ( bore ) , * those entering the bore and scattering out of it , and * those entering the bore and leaving the downstream face of the collimator .",
    "in the present paper , courant s type-1 particles will correspond to our ` outer tracks ' ( ots ) , type-2 particles to our ` bore - scattered inner tracks ' ( bsits ) , and type-3 particles to our ` going - through inner tracks ' ( gtits ) , see fig .  [",
    "fig : model1 ] . the tracks which do not hit the block will comprise the ` pristine ' beam .",
    "aiming at the determination of the optimal material for proton - beam collimation and intending to provide data for experiments at the linear accelerator of the national institute for research in nuclear science ( nirns ) at harwell , burge and smith ( 1962 ) re - addressed the slit - scattering problem and obtained a solution via the numerical integration of the diffusion equation .",
    "burge and smith reported considerable differences to courant s results . in the last section of their article",
    ", the authors discussed alternative approaches to the slit - scattering problem .",
    "a monte - carlo ( mc ) method , as a means to study the collimator - scattering effects , was introduced by paganetti ( 1998 ) . using the geant code to simulate a proton beamline at the hahn - meitner institut ( hmi ) in berlin , paganetti introduced simple parameterisations to account for the changes in the energy and angular divergence of the beam as it traverses the various beamline elements . judging from fig .",
    "6 of that paper , one expects the scattering effects to be around the @xmath2 level .",
    "in the last section of his article , paganetti correctly predicted that ` monte - carlo methods will become important for providing proton phase - space distributions for input to treatment - planning routines , though the calculation of the target dose will still be done analytically . '",
    "our strategy is similar to that of paganetti : the dose , delivered by the pristine beam , will be corrected for scattering effects on the basis of results obtained via mc runs prior to planning ( actually , when the particular proton - treatment machine is configured ) .",
    "block scattering was also investigated , along the general lines of paganetti s paper , in the work of van luijk ( 2001 ) .",
    "the ( same version of the ) geant code was used , to simulate a proton beamline at kernfysisch versneller instituut ( kvi ) in groningen , and the characteristics of the scattered protons were studied . to validate their approach ,",
    "the authors obtained dose measurements for several field sizes and at several distances from the block . unlike other works",
    ", the effect of scattering in air was also included in that study , and turned out to be more significant than previously thought ( its contribution to the angular divergence of the beam exceeded @xmath3 mrad per @xmath3 m of air ) .",
    "one of the interesting conclusions of that paper was that the penumbra of the dose distribution is mostly accounted for by the lateral spread of the undisturbed beam ; that conclusion somewhat allayed former fears that the extraction of the effective - source size ( @xmath4 ) and of the effective source - axis distance ( sad ) , both obtained from measurements conducted in the presence of a block , might be seriously affected by block - scattering contributions .",
    "finally , the paper addressed the asymmetries induced by a misalignment of the block , concluding that they might be sizable .    in their recent work , kimstrand ( 2008 ) put the emphasis on the scattering off the multi - leaf collimator ( mlc ) . in their approach , they also obtain the values of the parameters ( involved in their corrections ) by using a mc geant - based method . in their section ` discussion and conclusions ' , the authors , setting forth the future perspectives , mention that ` a challenge  is to implement collimator scatter for a pencil beam kernel dose calculation engine . '",
    "we agree on this being ` a challenge ' .",
    "the authors then advance to pre - empt that `  the methods presented  can straightforwardly be applied to arbitrary shaped collimators of different materials , such as moulded patient - specific collimators used in passively scattered proton beams . '",
    "one should at least remark that their paper does not contain adequate information supporting the thesis that the proposed approach is of practical use in a domain where the execution time is a important factor .",
    "in the present paper , the standard icru ( 1987 ) coordinate system will be used ; in beam s eye view , the @xmath5 axis points to the right , @xmath6 upward , and @xmath7 toward the source . the origin of the coordinate system is the isocentre .      assuming vanishing transmission outside the aperture of the bl / bsd , all relevant contributions to the fluence involve 2d integrals over its area .",
    "the evaluation of such integrals is time - consuming ; at a time when serious efforts are made to reduce the overall time allotted to each patient , the generous allocation of resources in the evaluation and application of _ corrections _ to the primary dose is unacceptable . to expedite the extraction of these corrections",
    ", one must find a fast way to decompose the effects of a 2d object ( e.g. , of the aperture of the bl / bsd ) into one - dimensional , easily - calculable , easily - applicable contributions .",
    "an example of one such 2d object is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniblock1 ] ; the area b represents the aperture ( corresponding to full transmission of the beam ) and is separated from the area a , representing the ( high-@xmath1 ) material , via the contour c. full attenuation of the beam is assumed in the area a. the contour c and the ` outer ' contour of the area a ( which is not shown ) may have any arbitrary shape ( e.g. , rectangular , circular , etc . ) ; the only requirement is that the contour c be contained within the contour of the area a.    let us assume that the aim is to derive the influence of the bl / bsd at one point q ( fig .  [",
    "fig : miniblock2 ] ) ; the point q is projected to the point p , on the bl / bsd plane .",
    "the point p may be contained in the interior or the exterior of the area b.      to enable the evaluation of the effects of the bl / bsd at the point q , a set of @xmath8 directions on the bl / bsd plane , intersecting at the point p , are chosen ; an example with @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniblock3 ] .",
    "the effects of the bl / bsd at the point q will be evaluated from the elementary contributions of the line segments corresponding to the intersection of @xmath8 straight lines with the contour c. these line segments , which are contained within the area b and are bound by the contour c , will be called _ miniblocks_. the effect of the bl / bsd at the point q will be evaluated by averaging the elementary contributions of the miniblocks created around the point p. in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniblock3 ] , one of these miniblocks is represented by the line segment @xmath10 .",
    "obviously , the number of miniblocks in each direction depends on the number of intersections of the straight line ( drawn through the point p , parallel to the chosen direction ) and the contour c.      as in the previous section , a set of @xmath8 directions , intersecting at the point p , are chosen ; an example with @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniblock4 ] .",
    "again , the effects of the bl / bsd at the point q will be evaluated on the basis of the elementary contributions in these @xmath8 directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniblock4 ] , one of the miniblocks is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "evidently , the number of directions @xmath8 is arbitrary . for fixed @xmath8 ,",
    "the accuracy of the evaluation depends on the details of the contour c and on the proximity of the point p to it .",
    "the reliability of the estimation is expected to increase with @xmath8 .",
    "( the evaluation is exact for @xmath12 . )",
    "there is one difference between the cases described in sections [ sec : within ] and [ sec : without ] . in case",
    "that the point p lies within the area b , there will always be at least one miniblock per direction ; if the point p lies outside the area b , there might be no intersections with the contour c in some directions ( in which case , the corresponding elementary contributions vanish ) .",
    "let us assume that the physical characteristics of the beam ( lateral spread , angular divergence , energy , etc . ) and the entire geometry ( also involving the bl / bsd ) are fixed .",
    "apart from the original point q , the elementary contributions will involve ( the coordinates of ) three additional points : the two end points of the particular miniblock and the point p. due to the fact that the @xmath8 directions are created around the point p , the two end points of every miniblock and the point p will always lie on one straight line . if the point p lies within the area b , it may lie within or outside a miniblock . on the other hand ,",
    "if the point p lies outside the area b , it will always lie outside any corresponding miniblock . in any case",
    ", the elementary contribution of a miniblock will generally be a function of the distance of its two end points to the point p. additionally , the elementary contribution of a miniblock to the point q will also involve the distance of the point q to the bl / bsd plane , denoted as @xmath7 in fig .  [",
    "fig : miniblock2 ] .",
    "a few remarks are worth making .",
    "* the angle between consecutive directions may be constant or variable .",
    "if the angle is not constant , weights ( to the elementary contributions ) have to be applied . * the values of @xmath8 in sections [ sec : within ] and [ sec : without ] do not have to be the same .",
    "furthermore , different values of @xmath8 might be used for the points which are projected onto the interior ( or exterior ) of the area b , e.g. , depending on the proximity of the point p to the contour c.    at present , the method of this paper applies only to bl / bsds with a constant aperture profile throughout their thickness ; to derive the corrections in case of other shapes ( e.g. , for bl / bsds with a tapered aperture profile ) , substantial modifications are required .",
    "the approach is applicable to any type of bl / bsd , be it the primary collimator , the mlc , or the block ; to derive the corrections , the only input pieces are the physical characteristics of the material ( of which the bl / bsd is made ) and , naturally , geometrical details . from now on ,",
    "however , we will restrict ourselves to the effects induced by the block , which ( given its proximity to the patient ) are expected to be of greater interest and importance in clinical applications .",
    "this choice , meant to emphasise importance , should not be seen as a restriction of the method .      a method for the evaluation of the thickness corrections",
    "was recently proposed by slopsema and kooy ( 2006 ) ; we will follow their terminology . thus , ` downstream ( upstream ) projection ' will indicate the projection of the downstream ( upstream ) face of the block on the ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) plane at the specified @xmath7 position ( depth ) . similarly , the ` extension ' of the block will correspond to the physical block translated in space ( from its actual position to the specified depth , parallel to the central beam axis ) .    in medical applications , the formal beam - shaper object ( e.g. , the so - called dicom block ) , which is created at planning time to represent the physical block , comprises the projection of the _ downstream face _ ( of the block ) to a plane ( perpendicular to the beam ) at isocentre depth . the physical block ( extension )",
    "is therefore obtained via a simple scaling involving the source - axis and block - isocentre ( ibd ) distances .",
    "having retrieved the extension of the block , it is straightforward to obtain the downstream projection at any @xmath7 ; in order to obtain the upstream projections , one has to use , in addition to the aforementioned quantities , the block thickness ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the relation between the dicom block , the extension , and the downstream projection at a specified @xmath7 position is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry1 ] .",
    "the upstream projection is obtained by projecting the extension from depth @xmath14 .",
    "the thin - block approximation , which is currently used in clinical applications when evaluating the dose , corresponds to @xmath15 mm ( the downstream and upstream projections coincide at all @xmath7 values ) .    assuming that the coordinates of the projected ( downstream- or upstream - face , as the case might be ) ends of a miniblock are denoted as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the contribution of the miniblock to the fluence at a point @xmath18 ( lying on the straight line defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) on the calculation plane is given by the formula @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the error function and @xmath21 stand for the rms ( lateral ) spreads of the beam at the specified depth .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 are obtained via source mirroring according to the method of slopsema and kooy ( 2006 ) ; as points on the downstream or upstream faces of the block are used , the resulting @xmath22 values in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dcontributions ] ) are equal only when one block face is involved in the mirroring process .    one simple example of the projections on the calculation plane is shown in fig .  [ fig : geometry2 ] ; the block extension is contained within the downstream projection , which ( in turn ) is contained within the upstream projection .",
    "in reality , depending on the complexity of the shape of the block aperture and on the relative position of the central beam axis , these three contours might intersect one another .",
    "the central beam axis intersects the calculation plane at the origin of the ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) coordinate system .",
    "one miniblock is shown ( the line segment contained within the block extension ) , along with two points , one within the miniblock ( p ) , another outside the miniblock ( p@xmath23 ) .",
    "the fluence contributions to both points may be evaluated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dcontributions ] ) with the appropriate @xmath24 and @xmath21 values .",
    "the essentials for the evaluation of the contribution of a miniblock to the fluence at a specified point on the calculation plane are to be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry3 ] .",
    "although , in the general case , the miniblock does not contain the intersection of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes of fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry2 ] , all lengths ( which are important to our purpose ) scale by the same factor , thus enabling the simplified picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry3 ] .    according to slopsema and kooy ( 2006 ) ,",
    "the source is mirrored onto the calculation plane by using points either on the downstream or on the upstream face of the block .",
    "the values of the mirrored - source size , corresponding to these two options , are given by @xmath25 and @xmath26    the coordinates of the projected points @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are obtained on the basis of fig .  [ fig : geometry3 ] via simple operations .",
    "the last item needed to derive the contributions to the fluence may be found on page 5444 of the paper of slopsema and kooy ( 2006 ) : ` protons whose tracks project inside the aperture extension onto the plane of interest see the upstream face as the limiting boundary . only for protons",
    "whose tracks end up outside the aperture on the plane of interest is the downstream face the limiting aperture boundary . ' in fact , this statement applies to the case of a half - block ( one - sided block ) .",
    "the modification , however , in case of a miniblock is straightforward .",
    "* points within the extension of the aperture see the upstream face of the miniblock as the limiting boundary .",
    "* points outside the extension of the miniblock see one upstream _ and one downstream _ edge as limiting boundaries .    obviously , in order to evaluate the fluence at the point p ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry3 ] ) , one has to use the coordinates of the projected points @xmath27 and @xmath30 , along with @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dcontributions ] ) . on the other hand , to evaluate the fluence at p@xmath23 , one has to use @xmath27 along with @xmath31 ( contribution of the ` left ' part of the miniblock ) and @xmath29 along with @xmath32 ( contribution of the ` right ' part of the miniblock ) .",
    "this simplified picture , featuring what a point ` perceives ' as limiting boundaries , suffices in obtaining the appropriate fluence contributions .    finally , the number of contributions which a point will receive depends on the geometry and on the shape of the block .",
    "one example of a point receiving two contributions in a given direction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry4 ] ; the point p lies within the extension of the miniblock on the left and outside the extension of the miniblock on the right .",
    "additionally , one might have to deal with a block with more than one apertures ( hence contours ) . to determine in the present work the appropriate thickness corrections for arbitrary block - aperture shape and beamline geometry , dedicated software was developed .      before entering the details of the derivation of the scattering corrections",
    ", it is worth providing a concise outline of our approach .",
    "first of all , our aim is to obtain a _ fast and reliable _ solution to the scattering problem ; exact analytical solutions are welcome as long as they fulfill this requirement .",
    "second , the solution has to be general enough for direct application to all proton - treatment machines .    to expedite the derivation and application of the corrections at planning time",
    ", we will introduce a two - step approach .",
    "* all the parameters which are independent of the specific details of plans will be evaluated during the beam - configuration phase ; given a fixed ( hardware ) setup , every treatment machine is configured only once . * the corrections for each particular plan",
    "will be derived ( at planning time ) from the existing results ( i.e. , those obtained at beam - configuration phase ) via simple interpolations .",
    "given that the physics of multiple scattering is known , it is possible to obtain the exact solution for the relevant beam properties ( lateral spread , angular divergence ) from the beamline characteristics of each treatment machine .",
    "however , it is unrealistic to introduce a dedicated process for each supported machine , especially in order to derive corrections to the delivered dose .",
    "additionally , if a dedicated ( per - case ) approach is implemented in a software product which is intended to support a variety of machine manufacturers , one has to be prepared to allot the necessary resources whenever a new product appears . to avoid these problems and to retain the generality of the approach , one has no other choice but to introduce a simple , adjustable model to account for the beam optics .",
    "the model of the present paper has only one parameter , which will be fixed from half - block fluence measurements .",
    "the parameters which achieve the description of the various distributions of the scattered protons are determined via mc runs .",
    "these runs take account of the variability in the block material , block thickness , incident energy ( energy at nozzle entrance ) , and nozzle - equivalent thickness ( net ) for all the options ( combinations of the hardware components of the beamline , leading to ranges of available energies and of nets , as well as imposing restrictions on the field size ) for which a machine is configured . to enable the easy use of the results ,",
    "the output is put in the form of expansion parameters in two geometrical quantities which are involved in the description of the scattering effects .",
    "the scattering corrections for all the blocks in a plan are determined ( at planning time ) from the aforementioned results via simple interpolations .",
    "the application of the corrections involves the concept of miniblocks , as they have been introduced in section [ sec : miniblocks ] of this paper .",
    "one model which is frequently used in beam optics features the bivariate gaussian distribution in the lateral direction @xmath6 ( distance to the central beam axis ) and the ( small ) angle @xmath33 ( with respect to that axis ) .",
    "( rotational symmetry is assumed here . )",
    "@xmath34 with @xmath35 the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent twice the variance in @xmath6 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the ( @xmath6,@xmath33 ) correlation is defined as @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 ( which is bound between @xmath40 and @xmath3 ) is a measure of the focusing in the beam .",
    "positive @xmath39 values indicate a defocusing system , negative a focusing one ; this becomes obvious after one puts eq .",

    "( [ eq : abcz ] ) have to be modified accordingly , to take account of the beam broadening due to multiple scattering .",
    "the accurate modelling of the beam may be obtained on the basis of formulae such as those given in the previous section . in section [ sec : scattering ] , however , we reasoned that a simplified parameterisation of the beamline is desirable ; one additional argument may be put forth .    currently , as far as proton therapy is concerned , four dose - delivery techniques are in use : single - scattering , double - scattering , uniform - scanning ( formerly known as wobbling ) , and modulated - scanning ( formerly simply known as scanning ) . in the modulated - scanning technique ,",
    "magnets deflect a narrow beam onto a sequence of pre - established points ( spots ) on the patient ( for pre - determined optimal times ) , thus ` scanning ' the ( cross section of the ) region of interest .",
    "uniform scanning involves the spread - out of the beam using fast magnetic switching .",
    "the broadening of the beam in the single - scattering technique is achieved by one scatterer , made of a high-@xmath1 material and placed close to the entrance of the nozzle .",
    "currently , the most ` popular ' technique involves a double - scattering system .    in a double - scattering system ,",
    "a second scatterer is placed downstream of the first scatterer in order to achieve efficient broadening of the beam ; studies of the effects of the second scatterer may be found in the literature , e.g. , see takada ( 2002 ) and more recent reports by the same author and gottschalk .",
    "the second scatterer is usually made of two materials : a high-@xmath1 ( such as lead ) material at the centre ( i.e. , close to the central beam axis ) , surrounded by a low-@xmath1 ( such as aluminium , lexan , etc . )",

    "it is not difficult to prove that , given the aforementioned rules for generating the ( @xmath6,@xmath33 ) events , the open - field fluence at a lateral position @xmath6 at depth @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "it has to be emphasised that this definition of the fluence does not involve an overall @xmath64-factor ( @xmath65 being the distance between the calculation plane and the source ) ; therefore , this formula is compatible with the format in which the lateral fluence measurements , used during the beam - configuration phase , appear .    it can be shown that the only modification in case that a half - block is inserted into the beamline ( e.g. , as shown in fig .",

    "the elements needed for the description of the passage of particles through matter may be found ( in a concise form ) in yao ( 2006 ) , starting on page 258 ; most of the deflection of a charged particle traversing a medium is due to coulomb scattering off nuclei . despite its incompleteness ( e.g. ,",

    "nevertheless , to retain simplicity , we will assume that the energy distribution of all inner tracks follows the formula @xmath172 .",
    "* the energy distribution of the ots is strongly smeared toward low @xmath171 values .",
    "the ots lose a significant amount of their energy when traversing the material of the block ; as shown in fig .  [",

    ", we used the empirical formula @xmath176 where the parameter @xmath177 turns out to be around @xmath178 to @xmath179 ; the constant of proportionality is obtained from the normalisation of the probability distribution .",
    "courant s effective - size corrections , corresponding to the three aforementioned cases , are : @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 mm . at small aperture sizes ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the fluence ( of the scattered protons ) originates from ots ; the inner tracks dominate at high aperture values .",
    "the crossover is energy - dependent , ranging from about @xmath129 ( option-@xmath3 result ) to @xmath183 mm ( option-@xmath136 result ) .",
    "the absolute yields of the different types of the scattered protons are given in table [ tab : yields ] for an aperture size ( i.e. , the diameter , assuming circular shape ) of @xmath133 mm .",
    "we observe that the absolute yield of the ots increases by a factor of about @xmath178 between @xmath168 and @xmath169 mev , and by more than @xmath184 between @xmath169 and @xmath170 mev . at @xmath168 mev ,",
    "the bsits account for more than @xmath79 of the total yield of the scattered protons .",

    "the verification of the method of the present paper should obviously involve the reproduction of dedicated dose measurements obtained in some material which , as far as the stopping power for protons is concerned , resembles human tissue , e.g. , in water .",
    "the measurements should cover the region around the isocentre , where the tumour is usually placed , and , in order that the approach be validated also in the entrance region , they should extend to small distances from ( the downstream face of ) the block . finally , the method must be validated for a range of depth values ( associated with the energy at nozzle exit ) .    at present ,",
    "given the lack of dedicated dose measurements , the only possibility for verification rests on re - using the calibration data ( i.e. , the half - block fluence measurements described in section [ sec : measurements ] ) .",
    "we are aware of the fact that using the same data for configuring a system and for validating its output does not constitute an acceptable practice .",

    "alternative options have been established ( e.g. , the @xmath102-index approach of low ( 1998 ) ) , but have not been tried in this work .",
    "one has to bear in mind that the block - scattering contributions are larger at small distances from the block and in the area neighbouring its extension ; at large distances , the distributions of the scattered protons broaden as a result of the angular divergence of the scattered beam and , less importantly , of scattering in air ( an effect which has not been included in this paper ) .",
    "evidently , the assessment of the goodness of the reproduction of the data , paying no attention to the characteristics of the effect in terms of the depth @xmath7 , makes little sense .",

    "( a review article , providing the details of the dose evaluation in proton therapy , as well as its implementation in eclipse , will appear soon , see ulmer ( 2009 ) . )",
    "a simple rectangular water phantom was created , within which a planning treatment volume ( ptv ) of @xmath207 was arbitrarily outlined .",
    "four one - field treatment plans were subsequently created as follows :    * \\a ) a plan without block - relating corrections , * \\b ) a plan with block - thickness corrections , * \\c ) a plan with block - scattering corrections , and * \\d ) a plan with both block - relating corrections  .    in each of these plans ,",
    "a brass block was inserted and fitted to the cross section of the ptv .",
    "subsequently , a dose of @xmath133 gy was delivered to the ptv , using the double - scattering technique of the ncc machine .",
    "the block - relating corrections were estimated on the basis of @xmath208 ; in fact , the results are practically insensitive to the value of @xmath8 , for @xmath209 .",
    "finally , the resulting dose maps were compared ; the dose differences of plans ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) to plan ( a ) were estimated and compared ( figs .  [",
    "fig : eclipse1 ] and [ fig : eclipse2 ] ) , leading to the following conclusions .    * as expected , the application of the block - thickness corrections results in lower dose values .",
    "this is due to the fact that part of the incident flux is blocked as a result of the nonzero thickness of the block . *",
    "as expected , the application of the block - scattering corrections leads to higher dose values .",
    "this is because some protons , which would otherwise fail to contribute to the fluence ( as they impinge upon the block ) , scatter off the material of the block and ` re - emerge ' at positions in the bore or on the downstream face of the block . *",
    "as far as the delivered dose is concerned , the effects of the block thickness and block scattering ` compete ' one another . in the water phantom used in this section , the block - thickness corrections dominate .",
    "* the presence of the block in the plan of the water phantom used in this section induces effects which amount to a few percent of the prescribed dose ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eclipse2 ] ) .",
    "the largest effects appear in the area neighbouring the border of the block .",
    "it is also worth noticing the characteristic contributions of the scattered protons in the entrance region in the frontal and sagittal views in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse2 ] ; the largest part of the dose in the entrance region corresponds to the low - energy component of the scattered beam . as the _ local _ dose , delivered in the entrance region , is significantly smaller than the corresponding value delivered to the target ( which , in fact , is an agrument in favour of the use of protons in radiation therapy ) , the corrections which one has to apply to it , though representing a small fraction of the _ prescribed _ dose , are sizable",
    "the present work deals with corrections which are due to the presence of beam - limiting and beam - shaping devices in proton planning .",
    "the application of these corrections is greatly facilitated by decomposing the effects of two - dimensional objects into one - dimensional , easily - calculable contributions ( miniblocks ) .    in the derivation of the thickness corrections , we follow the strategy of slopsema and kooy ( 2006 ) . given the time restrictions during the planning , the derivation of the scattering corrections necessitates the introduction of a two - step approach .",
    "the first step occurs at the beam - configuration phase . at first",
    ", the value of the only parameter of our model ( @xmath58 ) is extracted from the half - block fluence measurements .",
    "a number of monte - carlo runs follow , the output of which consists of the parameters pertaining to convenient parameterisations of the fluence contributions of the scattered protons .",
    "these runs take account of the variability in the block material and thickness , incident energy , and nozzle - equivalent thickness in all the options for which a proton - treatment machine is configured . to enable the easy use of the mc results , the output is put in the form of expansion parameters in two geometrical quantities which are involved in the description of the scattering effects .",
    "the scattering corrections for all the blocks in a particular plan are determined from the results , obtained at beam - configuration phase , via simple interpolations .",
    "the verification of the method should involve the reproduction of dedicated dose measurements . at present , given the lack of such measurements , the only possibility for verification rested on re - using the half - block fluence measurements , formerly analysed to extract the @xmath58 value ; this is a valid option because parts of the input data had been removed from the database to suppress the ( present in the measurements ) block - scattering contributions .",
    "we investigated the goodness of the reproduction of the measurements on the basis of the @xmath153 function and concluded that the inclusion of the scattering effects leads to substantial improvement .",
    "the method presented in this paper was applied to one plan involving a simple water phantom ; the different contributions from the two block - relating effects have been separately presented and compared .",
    "these effects amount to a few percent of the prescribed dose and are significant in the entrance region and in the area neighbouring the border of the block .",
    "the author acknowledges helpful discussions with barbara schaffner concerning the optimal implementation of the method in eclipse .",
    "barbara also modelled and implemented in eclipse the important ( in the entrance region ) dose contributions of the low - energy scattered protons ( i.e. , those with energies below the lowest value used in the particular plan to ` spread out ' the bragg peak ) .",
