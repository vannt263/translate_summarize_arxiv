    "relativistic quantum effects , in particular , electron - positron pair creation , in superstrong coulomb field attract attention of physicists already for a long time .",

    ". we also realize that a solution of the latter problem marks only the beginning of constructing qed with superstrong coulomb field .",
    "it should be noted that just after the dirac equation was established , a number of physicists tried to comment on and solve this spectral problem making sometimes contradictory conclusions .",
    "it seems that there is no consesus on this problem even at present .",

    ", the lowest discrete level passes into the lower continuum for @xmath44 . and again the applicability of the dirac equation now for nonpoint nuclei with charges @xmath45 was called into question .",
    "it was supposed that the new difficulties are connected with a many - particle character of the problem under consideration , in particular , with a possible @xmath46 pair creation by a nucleus with the charge @xmath44 . since that time almost all researchers in this area repeated this point of view in their publications",
    ". however , recently , there appeared a publication @xcite where this conclusion was recognized to be wrong . for us , after a rehabilitation of the electron spectrum in the coulomb field of a point nucleus , it would be very strange to accept the fact that a removal of the singularity of the coulomb potential at the origin ( after a cutoff ) makes a situation with the spectrum not better , but worse . in view of a great importance of all the details of the spectral problem for constructing a corresponding secondly quantized theory , we turn to the spectral problem with a cutoff once again .",
