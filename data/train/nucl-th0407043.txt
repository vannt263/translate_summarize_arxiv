    "the nuclear level density is an important ingredient in the prediction of nuclear reaction rates in astrophysics . so far",
    ", most theoretical , global calculations of astrophysical rates assume an equal distribution of the state parities at all energies .",
    "it is obvious that this assumption is not valid at low excitation energies of a nucleus .",
    "however , a globally applicable recipe was lacking . for nuclei far from stability , where no experimental information on excited states is available , a large effect of the parity dependence on predicted cross sections can be expected .",
    "single particle levels are divided into two groups , according to the individual parities .",
    "the group which has the smaller average occupation number is denoted by @xmath0 . assuming that nucleons occupy the single - particle orbitals independently and randomly , the occupancy @xmath1 of the @xmath0-parity orbits is given @xcite by a poisson distribution , @xmath2 [ eq:1 ] where @xmath3 is the average occupancy of orbits with parity @xmath0 .",
    "then the ratio of the odd - parity to the even - parity probabilities is given by @xcite @xmath4 in nuclei , @xmath3 has to be replaced by the sum of individual contributions from neutrons and protons . to calculate the total partition function @xmath5 we use the macroscopic - microscopic nuclear level density of @xcite .",
    "the average occupancy @xmath3 is computed from bcs occupation numbers based on single particle levels from an axially symmetric deformed saxon - woods potential @xcite with parameters from @xcite which reproduce experimental data well @xcite . all major shells up to @xmath6 were included which allows to extend our calculations way beyond the previously studied @xmath7 shell . using @xmath8 and eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , we can thus determine @xmath9 and calculate the thermal energies for even- and odd parity states .",
    "canonical entropies , heat capacities , and the parity projected level densities at a given excitation energy , are derived from standard thermodynamic relations .",
    "typical results for nuclei in the fe - region are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "on can see that the assumption of equally distributed state parities is not fulfilled . even at excitation energies of 10 - 15 mev ,",
    "the parity ratio is not yet equilibrated .    the evolution of the parity ratios within an isotopic chain is shown in fig .",
    "2 . starting with @xmath10zn , where the @xmath11-shell is filled in neutrons only to 20 % , and stopping with @xmath12zn , where the next major shell has started to be populated , one can see that the ratio approaches unity for lower values of the excitation energy as one approaches the @xmath13 shell closure .",
    "as the parity can only be changed by excitations from the @xmath11 to the @xmath14 shell , the ratio will equilibrate faster with increasing neutron number as the gap between the last occupied orbit in the @xmath11-shell and the @xmath14-shell will decrease . for @xmath15zn , where the @xmath11-shell is completely filled",
    ", a pronounced peak around 6 mev shows up , which might be understood as follows : as the @xmath11-shell is completely filled , the parity of the system will be changed by any neutron excitation , resulting in a dominance of negative parity states at the energies for which the peak appears . however , as shown below , this effect strongly depends on the inputs and has to be interpreted with caution .",
    "there are two essential inputs to our calculations : the total level density @xmath16 which is used to calculate the total partition function utilized in eq.([eq:1 ] ) and the single particle levels from the deformed saxon - woods potential needed to compute the average occupancy @xmath3 .",
    "both inputs are prone to possible uncertainties .",
    "we explored the sensitivity to these uncertainties by simulating the combined effects of uncertainties in both inputs by variation of only the total level density @xmath16 and keeping the saxon - woods parameters unchanged .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the impact of varying the level density parameter @xmath17 in the range of @xmath18 mev@xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath20 % variation of the standard parameter @xmath17 and implies a change in @xmath16 of up to a factor of 5 at an excitation energy of 6 mev .",
    "it has to be emphasized once more that this large variation of the level density is not due to the uncertainty of @xmath16 alone but rather is supposed to contain the combined uncertainties in @xmath16 _ and _ the single particle levels .",
    "[ fig:3 ] clearly shows the need for improved consistency within the inputs , especially at shell closures .",
    "we have shown that the assumption of equally distributed state parities is only justified for high excitation energies . for lower energies , even still at particle separation energies which are in the order of several mev ,",
    "this assumption is clearly not fulfilled .",
    "further investigations are needed to arrive at an understanding of the peak - strengths found at shell closures .",
    "work is in progress to calculate the parity distribution for a large number of nuclei far from stability on the proton as well as neutron rich side .",
    "influences on nucleosynthesis calculations will be studied .",
