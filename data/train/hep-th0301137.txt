    "the physical problem which we would like to address in a series of papers is a time dependence of the tension of an unstable non - bps d - brane in the process of its decay .",
    "it is expected that starting from its maximal value , equal to the density of the vacuum energy , the tension of an unstable non - bps d - brane becomes zero when the tachyon field approaches the true vacuum . in this paper",
    "we start with study of classical time dependent solutions describing a motion of the tachyon on an unstable non - bps d - brane within level truncation scheme in cubic open superstring field theory . in the next paper we will take into account higher level fields including vector fields and study a dynamics of a d - brane tension .    the tachyon potential and various classical solutions in sft on an unstable d - brane system",
    "have been intensively studied in the last two years ( see @xcite , reviews @xcite and references therein ) . in the beginning only time independent solutions representing either the tachyon vacuum or static d - branes of lower dimension have been examined .",
    "the process of production and decay of unstable branes can be described as a space - like d - brane @xcite . for earlier study of the tachyon dynamics on brane - antibrane system see , for example , @xcite .",
    "recently , sen has proposed to study the classical decay process of an unstable d - brane in the framework of sft @xcite .",
    "as compare to the usual local field theory the time dependent equation of sft containing a tachyon has special features .",
    "first , this equation involves infinite number of other fields .",
    "second , the string field theory action contains infinite number of time derivatives , and hence the initial value problem seems to be not well - defined . nevertheless , sen @xcite has shown that it is possible to construct a family of classical solutions to the string field theory equations of motion characterized by the initial position and velocity of the tachyon field .",
    "there are at least two different ways to construct time dependent solutions within sft :    * one can study solutions to sft equation of motion @xmath0 perturbatively , specifying some initial data .",
    "this way has been followed in the background approach to scattering theory in sft in @xcite as well as in sen s paper @xcite .",
    "* one can also study a tachyon dynamics within the level truncation scheme . as it has been noted in @xcite",
    "there are many similarities between the tachyon equation of motion obtained in sft via the level truncation and the p - adic string equation of motion @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the tachyon dynamics in ssft on a non - bps d - brane within the level truncation scheme @xcite .",
    "we derive the equation of motion for the tachyon in the first nontrivial approximation .",
    "we construct a special time dependent solution to this equation which starts from the perturbative vacuum and approaches one of stable vacua .",
    "to construct this solution we consider it as a positive time part of a solution that interpolates between two non - perturbative vacua . as in the case of the p - adic string @xcite to perform numerical study of the ssft tachyon equation of motion with boundary conditions on @xmath1 infinities , it is useful to deal with the integral form of the equation of motion .",
    "the integral form of the tachyon equation of motion in ssft is similar to the integral form of the tachyon equation of motion in the p - adic string @xcite for @xmath2 while the integral form of the bosonic sft is similar to one of the p - adic string for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to p - adic case , kernels of the integral equations describing sft and ssft tachyons are not positively defined and application of an iteration procedure is more subtle . by our request",
    "these simulations have been performed in @xcite and we will use these results in the paper .",
    "numerical analysis @xcite is based on an iteration procedure of solving nonlinear integral equations .",
    "it is interesting to note that sft and ssft tachyons equations can be considered as perturbations of the corresponding p - adic string equations of motion .",
    "the superstring interpolating tachyon solution can be obtained in a linear approximation around the corresponding p - adic ( p=3 ) solution .",
    "this approximation rather well reproduces results of numerical calculations .    in order to understand qualitative properties of solutions",
    "we write down the conserved energy functional .",
    "the energy @xmath4 is the sum of three terms , namely the kinetic term @xmath5 , the potential term @xmath6 and the non - local term @xmath7 .",
    "there are no difficulties to study numerically the kinetic @xmath5 and potential @xmath6 terms . to investigate numerically contribution of the non - local term @xmath7 we write it in a special form admitting an integral representation .",
    "the pressure is also the sum of three terms @xmath8 the non - local term @xmath9 is just a part of the non - local term @xmath7 contributing to the energy @xmath4 .",
    "we show that for large time @xmath10 while for @xmath11 , under a special approximation for the tachyon solution to the ssft equations of motion ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , @xmath12 .",
    "the energy @xmath4 is equal to the tachyon potential minimum and according to sen s conjecture the tension of the non - bps d - brane compensates this energy and the total energy of a system is equal to zero .",
    "this compensation has been checked for cubic ssft with rather good accuracy @xcite . since the total energy is equal to zero the total pressure also vanishes at large time for our solution .",
    "we also show that the pressure for this solution has its minimum at zero time and goes to minus energy at infinite time .",
    "let us also note that there are other approaches to study rolling tachyons .",
    "one of them is related to cft description of a non - bps d - brane dynamics .",
    "sen has noted @xcite ( and refs .",
    "therein ) that dynamics of a tachyon on an unstable d - brane can be described by an effective born - infeld action with an exponentially decreasing potential .",
    "though this action can not be derived from first principles it has some features desirable in a classical dynamics of open sft around the tachyon vacuum .",
    "namely , in this effective field theory there are solutions with fixed energy density and asymptotically vanishing pressure .",
    "these solutions are also interesting from cosmological point of view , see @xcite for details .",
    "let us note that it would be interesting to see more relations between sft and the effective born - infeld action .",
    "an incorporation of vector field could clarify this problem .",
    "this hope is supported by the observation that an incorporation of vector fields , apparently , reproduces the born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce a general setup , namely the cubic superstring field theory action for a description of an open superstring living on a non - bps d - brane . within the level truncation scheme we get from this action tachyon equations of motion .",
    "in fact in this paper we restrict ourself to the first non - trivial approximation which includes the tachyon field and one auxiliary field . under an assumption that even derivatives of the auxiliary field vary slowly we get an approximate version of the tachyon equation of motion .",
    "then we rewrite differential equations in the integral form . in section  3",
    "we present results of numeric study of the equations obtained in section  2 .    in section  4 functionals of the energy and pressure",
    "are studied .",
    "conservation of energy is calculated explicitly . for the pressure",
    "it is shown that it has minimum at zero time and equal to minus energy at infinite time .",
    "to perform actual calculations the level truncation scheme is employed .",
    "let us denote by @xmath28 the subset of vertex operators of ghost number @xmath29 and picture @xmath30 , created by the matter stress tensor @xmath31 , matter supercurrent @xmath32 and the ghost fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we restrict the string fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be in this subspace @xmath28 .",
    "next we expand @xmath40 in a basis of @xmath41 eigenstates , and write the action ( [ action7 ] ) in terms of space - time component fields .",
    "the string field is now a series with each term being a vertex operator from @xmath28 multiplied by a space - time component field .",
    "we define the level @xmath42 of string field s component @xmath43 to be @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the conformal dimension of the vertex operator multiplied by @xmath43 , i.e. by this convention the tachyon is taken to have level @xmath46 . to compose the action truncated at level",

    "there are small oscillations with decreasing amplitudes around the solutions to equation ( [ p=3 ] ) .",
    "the presence of this oscillations ( in fact oscillations with a complex frequency ) results from the presence of infinite number of derivatives in a linear equation describing a deviation of @xmath136 from @xmath138 .",
    "in this section we derive functional expressions for energy for tachyon equations ( [ 18 ] ) and for approximate equation ( [ psi - ap1 ] ) .",
