    "the ideas of kaluza and klein @xcite , advocating the physical possibility of extra dimensions in order to achieve the unification of different field theories can be considered as a landmark in quantum field theory .",
    "such an importance grew specially half a century after the original works , in the framework of supergravity and string theories . in the latter ,",
    "the existence of extra dimensions is actually enforced by consistency .",
    "furthermore , new possibilities to realize the extra dimensions permitted to explore new mechanisms of explaining unified field theories .",
    "the possibility of explaining hierarchies in such a context is specially appealing and has been confirmed in the works of arkani - hamed and others @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy between the electro - weak ( @xmath2 ) and the planck ( @xmath3 ) scales has been focused by means of the consideration of extra dimensions at a submilimeter size , which shows up in a theory of two extra dimensions connecting both scales .",
    "such an idea replaces the usual one where extra dimensions should only show up at the planck scale , and the tower of massive particles thus generated is above that level and has a wider validity , including cosmology @xcite .",
    "such size constraints on the size of the extra dimensions constitute drawbacks in the formulation of the theory .",
    "more recently , randall and sundrum @xcite proposed a model -or rather a class of models- where there is a warp factor in the metric , such that even infinitely large extra dimensions are allowed .",
    "the existence of large extra dimensions with a warp factor naturally raises the question of whether information can follow a shorter path outside the brane riding on gravitons @xcite .",
    "we proposed a simple calculation to establish the shortest path followed by a graviton @xcite , which propagating in all dimensions in the so called bulk , could in principle follow a path which decouples from the brane , that is , from our universe , returning later to another point , advanced in time with respect to a photon , which by construction must follow a path in the brane , thus being delayed . in our previous paper",
    "we considered a model constructed in @xcite which was basically a generalized friedmann - robertson - walker universe with cosmological constant , with different scenarios in the brane ( where are living the standard model fields ) and in the bulk .",
    "the result was actually a negative one , that is , the shortest path followed by the graviton was the same as the one followed by the photon , namely , inside the brane .    in a model introduced by cski et .",
    "@xcite the speed of light along flat four dimensional sections varies over the extra dimensions due to different warp factors for the space and time coordinates , a construction similar to the one of randall and sundrum .",
    "thus the authors proposed that gravitational waves might travel faster than photons , which remain in the brane .",
    "the delay between electromagnetic and gravity waves may be experimentally detected with the gravitational waves detectors under way @xcite .",
    "the models are basically ads - schwarzschild or ads - reissner - nordstrm black holes in the bulk .",
    "brane models in ads space with schwarzschild singularities have been used to understand the ads / cft correspondence and looks like a promising theoretical model @xcite .",
    "they are based on the randall - sundrum scheme @xcite , where a large mass hierarchy is obtained with uncompactified dimensions from solutions of einstein equations in higher dimensions ( i.e. , in the bulk ) with two separated branes .",
    "the four dimensional part of the metric is multiplied by a `` warp '' factor which is a rapidly changing function of the additional dimension .    in this paper",
    "we consider a six - dimensional model and look for possible shortcuts for ads - schwarzschild and ads - reissner - nordstrm bulk configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe a general six - dimensional model , derive einstein equations , and find the israel conditions the metric has to satisfy due to the brane embedding . at this point",
    "we choose a metric describing a six - dimensional black hole and add a @xmath4 symmetry . in section 3",
    "we find the euler - lagrange equations which define the graviton path in this model .",
    "section 4 is devoted to study the numerical solutions of these equations in the context of ads - schwarzschild bulk finding certain analytical requirements for the existence of shortcuts .",
    "the ads - reissner - nordstrm bulk is studied in section 5 , where we perform an analytical discussion to impose a set of conditions under which shortcuts can coexist with shielded singularities .",
    "finally , consequences are discussed in section 6 .",
    "we consider a six - dimensional model , such as the one constructed by kanti et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "we also search for a solution of six - dimensional einstein equation in ads space of the form    @xmath5    where @xmath6 represents the metric of the three dimensional spatial sections with @xmath7 corresponding to a hyperbolic , a flat and an elliptic space , respectively .",
    "the components of the einstein tensor read    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    the total energy - momentum tensor can be decomposed in two parts corresponding to the bulk and the brane as @xmath15 where the brane contribution can be written as @xmath16    in order to have a well - defined geometry , the metric must be continuous across the brane ; however , its derivatives with respect to @xmath1 can be discontinuous at the position of the brane , generating a dirac @xmath17-function in the second derivatives of the metric with respect to @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "furthermore , let us notice that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the null geodesic equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively obtained from @xmath48 thus , a null curve is extreme if and only if it is a null geodesic .",

    "then as @xmath78 goes to @xmath83 at the origin , the conditions @xmath84 and @xmath85 are necessary and , in fact , enough to have a horizon and assure that the brane lies after it .",

    "however , the condition is also satisfied with @xmath88 if we require @xmath89 and @xmath90    if we follow both ( [ schomega ] ) and ( [ schbpos ] ) together with the fine - tunning for the energy ( [ 6dmqadssch2 ] ) , we will have several shortcuts in ads - schwarzschild bulks with shielded singularity . in figures [ 6dadssch1 ] and [ 6dadssch2 ]",
    "we illustrate an example with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",

    "from the israel conditions ( [ bhisrael ] ) we will have for the black hole mass and charge , @xmath100    at this stage it is convenient to carefully study the possibility of existence of shortcuts for every value of @xmath101 .",
    "as it was found in the ads - schwarzschild case , ( [ f ] ) determines the existence of shortcuts . using ( [ hrn ] )",
    "we see that ( [ f ] ) has a zero in @xmath102 when @xmath103 if @xmath31 , we have a real root in @xmath104 if @xmath72 , we have two roots in @xmath105 finally , if @xmath70 , we have @xmath106    notice that @xmath107 has at most one real and positive zero if @xmath108 and at most two positive zeros if @xmath72 .    analyzing @xmath78 and its derivative",
    "we see that @xmath78 tends to @xmath109 both at the singularity and at infinity , while @xmath80 tends to @xmath83 at the singularity and to @xmath109 at infinity .",
    "the horizons occur at the zeros of @xmath78 , or equivalently , at the zeros of @xmath110    on the other hand , the non - vanishing zeros of @xmath80 occur when @xmath111 this polynom grows at infinity being negative at the origin .",
    "its derivative has non - vanishing roots when @xmath112 for @xmath82 this equation is never satisfied .",
    "thus , as the derivative of ( [ dpolz ] ) does not vanish and is positive outside the origin , the polynom ( [ dpolz ] ) grows monotonically and has just one root .",
    "the zeros of this polynom are all non - vanishing zeros of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for positive mass there is just one zero for @xmath80 , and hence , at most two horizons for @xmath78 .    when there is one horizon , @xmath80 is negative before it and positive after , crossing @xmath78 at the very horizon .",
    "if there are two horizons , @xmath80 vanishes at a point between cauchy and event horizons , being negative before this point and positive after , while @xmath78 is positive at all points except between both horizons .",
    "taking into account both the sign and zeros of these functions , @xmath80 crosses @xmath78 between the cauchy horizon and the point at which @xmath80 vanishes .",
    "since @xmath113 has the same sign as @xmath80 and vanishes at the same point , and in the same way @xmath114 has the same sign of @xmath78 and vanishes at the same points , we conclude that , existing horizons , @xmath107 necessarily vanishes at some point @xmath115 such that @xmath116 .",
    "however , as we pointed out before , for @xmath31 or @xmath70 there is only one positive root of @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath117 for @xmath118 , then @xmath71 for @xmath119 .",
    "thus , because @xmath120 , @xmath71 for @xmath121 contrary to what was required in ( [ f ] ) .",
    "this implies that there are no shortcuts with @xmath31 or @xmath70 when horizons exist .    in five dimensions",
    "the proof is very similar and we arrive to the same conclusion .      as we saw in the previous section , @xmath107 has two real , positive and distinct roots for @xmath72 , @xmath122 this is the only situation where the shortcuts can coexist with a shielded singularity .",
    "in fact , this situation necessarily requires the second root of @xmath107 being at some point before the brane position @xmath123 .",
    "this also implies @xmath124 .",
    "in addition , we must have both @xmath125 and @xmath51 positive .",
    "given the fact that we have horizons , if the brane is not between them or at a horizon position , then @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , in order to guarantee that the brane is located after the event horizon , we also need @xmath127 .    from the discussion in the previous section",
    "we will have one or two horizons if and only if @xmath128 .    in summary , shortcuts in bulks with shielded singularities can occur only if @xmath72 and also if the following conditions are supplied ,    1 .",

    "for our purposes it will be enough to require @xmath155 using ( [ root1 ] ) this implies @xmath156 this condition is necessary but not enough to have horizons .",
    "however , this restriction added to the others developed in this section will be enough to construct shortcuts with horizons as we will see . notice that this condition is stronger than that one assumed before , @xmath157 .    using ( [ 6dmqadsrn ] ) in ( [ mq1 ] ) , @xmath158    we know from ( [ ep1 ] ) that @xmath159 must be negative .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the shortest graviton path is governed by just one equation involving the `` radial '' extra coordinate .",
    "we have also seen that a symmetry in the `` angular '' extra coordinate has permitted us to consider curved spatial sections .",

    "we should also notice that the energy is already fine - tunned from the israel conditions in the case of the ads - schwarzschild bulk .",
    "hence , it is interesting to notice that despite the fact that the charge contributes to have a negative @xmath218 and thus facilitates the existence of shortcuts , there are more restrictive conditions for the energy coming from @xmath130 and from the horizons equation ( [ x ] ) which do not appear in the uncharged case . in this way",

    "we should notice that our set of conditions to obtain shortcuts in ads - schwarzschild and ads - reissner - nordstrm bulks with protected singularities impose a restriction on the size of the universe , namely @xmath219 , which corresponds to a primeval universe .",
    "so the results shown in the present paper could contribute to the solution of this important problem .",
    "we can also point out experimental consequences .",
    "in particular , gravitational waves advanced with respect to photons might be found in the proposed gravitational antennas under way , in case we find a model for the universe with a physical size ."
