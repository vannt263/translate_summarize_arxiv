    "they are comparable to those obtained using the ausmdv scheme . based on this comparison",
    ", we anticipate that all finite volume codes in which the treatment of the shock relies on an upwind technique are likely to share the same difficulty : quantities produced at the shock location , such as vorticity and entropy waves , or the reflected acoustic wave , are computed with a first order accuracy with respect to the mesh size .",
    "likewise , we anticipate that all finite volume codes will suffer from the presence of spurious high frequency oscillations similar to those described above .",
    "it is indeed well known that such codes are subject to this problem , especially in the case of standing shocks , as was reported by @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the problem is made worse by the interaction between the shock and the sound wave ( in the absence of the latter , we barely detected high frequency oscillations , with an amplitude of the order of @xmath99 of the amplitude of the reflected entropy wave ) .",
    "as described by @xcite , any additional source of dissipation ( artificial viscosity , grid translation ) will result in a decrease of the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "for example , with ramses , the use of the monotonised central slope limiter @xcite , which is known to be less dissipative than minmod , resulted in the amplitude of the oscillations being about three times larger .",
    "however , the complete stabilisation of the oscillations ( through the use of artificial viscosity for example ) would most probably come at the cost of reducing the growth rate , which we show in sect .  5 not to be affected by the oscillations .",

    "one difficulty for this simulation is the numerical relaxation of the unperturbed flow on the computational grid , which can result in a slow drift of the shock .",

    "the linear evolution is dominated by the mode @xmath42 , as expected from the linear stability analysis . the comparison with the perturbative calculation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_full ] .",
    "the oscillation frequency and growth rate , determined numerically , are accurate to about @xmath109 for @xmath110 , suggesting that the spurious high frequency oscillations revealed in sect .",
    "3.4 and 4.2 have a minor effect on the eigenfrequency of the most unstable mode . the slight excess of the growth rate @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig_full ] may be related to the fact that entropy and vorticity pertrubations are slightly overproduced at the shock , as seen in fig .  5 for problem  2 .",
    "this effect , however , should be partially compensated by the slight underproduction of the acoustic feedback in problem  1 ( fig .",
    "+ a significant damping of the instability ( @xmath112 ) occurs if the grid is too coarse @xmath113 but even then , the oscillation frequency is accurate within @xmath109 .",
    "the surprising accuracy of the oscillation frequency can be understood by the fact that the oscillation timescale is closely related to the timescale , for an advective - acoustic cycle between the shock and the deceleration region . since the position of the acoustic feedback",
    "is set by the external potential in our toy model , this timescale barely depends on the numerical resolution .",
    "one must keep in mind that in a realistic flow where gradients are due to cooling processes , a change of numerical resolution could influence the position of the deceleration region , and could thus affect the oscillation timescale of the instability .",
    "the results of our numerical experiments can be helpful to choose the mesh size in future simulations of a collapsing stellar core , both at the shock and near the neutron star , in order to make sure that the physics of sasi is correctly treated , at least in the linear regime .",
    "of course , the influence of sasi on the mechanism of core - collapse supernovae depends on non - linear quantities such as the amplitude of the shock oscillations , the advection time through the gain region , or the spectral distribution of energy below the shock .",
    "characterising which of the non - linear properties of sasi are most sensitive to the numerical technique is beyond the scope of the present study , and will be investigated in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we believe however that the coupling between entropy , vorticity and pressure is likely to play an important role even in the non linear regime of sasi , both through the flow gradients and at the shock . the wide range of frequencies involved in the non linear evolution of sasi ( e.g. yoshida et al .",
    "2007 ) suggests that the accuracy of the numerical treatment should not be limited to the low frequency of the most unstable mode . in this sense",
    ", the numerical constraints deduced from our linear analysis should be considered as a minimum requirement , even - though some non - linear consequences of sasi may be less sensitive to numerical resolution than others : the addition of numerical errors with opposite signs , mentioned in sect .  5 , may contribute to the complex , non monotonic dependence of the explosion time with respect to the numerical resolution , observed by murphy & burrows ( 2008 ) .      when the shock stalls above the proto - neutron star , the flow deceleration close to the neutron star is dominated by cooling processes much more than by gravity , and the advective - acoustic coupling there is not adiabatic . by making the choice of simplicity ,",
    "our toy model does not aim at reproducing quantitatively the efficiency of the acoustic feedback in a non - adiabatic flow .",
    "it helps understand that a simulation with a coarse grid in the vicinity of the neutron star may be unable to take into account a possible acoustic feedback from this region , simply because advected perturbations are numerically damped before reaching it .",
    "let us consider a numerical simulation of an advective - acoustic cycle dominated by the oscillation frequency @xmath41 .",
    "the choice of the mesh size close to the surface of the neutron star is not obvious because the wavelength of advected perturbations @xmath114 shrinks as the gas is decelerated .",
    "fortunately , an accurate advection of this perturbation is needed only down to the region where most of the acoustic feedback is generated , adiabatic or not . since the timescale of the advective - acoustic cycle is larger than the advection timescale , and comparable to the oscillation timescale @xmath115 of the fundamental mode , the region of feedback is necessarily above the radius @xmath116 reached by the gas during one sasi oscillation . according to figs .  4 and 5 of fgsj07 ,",
    "the dominant mode is the fundamental one ( @xmath117 ) if the shock is close to the neutron star , or the first harmonic ( @xmath118 ) if the shock distance is large enough .",
    "@xmath116 is thus defined by : @xmath119 a possible strategy to choose the mesh size @xmath120 in the inner region of the flow could be to make sure that the advected perturbations are correctly advected down to this radius @xmath116 . denoting by @xmath121 the number of grid zones per wavelength required for an accurate advection and acoustic coupling of vorticity perturbations ,",

    "we have proposed a conservative estimate of the desired mesh size close to the neutron star , which guarantees that the dominant acoustic feedback from advected perturbations is correctly taken into account . *",
    "the difficulties associated with the numerical treatment of the shock have direct consequences on the accuracy with which the flow resulting from sasi is calculated : without a special numerical effort , the convergence of the computation of the growth time and oscillation frequency of sasi is reduced to first order even if the numerical scheme converges with a higher order away from the shock . among the published simulations of sasi , only the 2d simulations with the finest grid seem to be able to estimate the entropy and vorticity production at the shock with a @xmath138 accuracy .",
    "the importance of an accurate treatment of sasi in the core - collapse problem may make it worth implementing advanced techniques for the numerical treatment of the shock in future simulations , such as the level set method for example @xcite .",
