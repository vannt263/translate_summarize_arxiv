    "gas flows in the vicinity of a compact object , particularly black hole and neutron star , are expected to be highly relativistic .",
    "however , far away of it , when infalling matter comes off , e.g. , a companion star , flows are rather non - relativistic . therefore , during accretion of matter from a large distance",
    ", flows should transit from the non - relativistic to relativistic regime while reaching the vicinity of the black hole horizon or the neutron star surface , when flow is expected to be sub - keplerian in nature .",
    "indeed , it is generally believed that the velocity and temperature at the inner edge of accretion disk are very high . not only the cases in accretion , highly relativistic flows are involved in astrophysical jets from galactic , extragalactic black holes , gamma - ray bursts etc .",
    "( e.g. zensus 1997 ; mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ; mszros 2002 ) , with the velocity @xmath4 times the speed of light .",
    "the collimated dipolar outflows emerging from deep inside collapsars , according to the collapsar model of gamma - ray burst ( woosley 1993 ) , are expected to achieve a lorentz factor more than @xmath5 .",
    "as the accretion and outflow / jet are expected to be coupled ( influencing each other ; bhattacharya , ghosh & mukhopadhyay 2010 ) , any change / transition ( e.g. as mentioned above ) in the accretion flow would influence the jet and hence the underlying inferences .",
    "when the velocity varies from the non - relativistic to relativistic ( ultra - relativistic ) regime , the corresponding polytropic index ( @xmath1 ) in the equation of state ( eos ) , i.e. the ratio of gas to total pressure ( @xmath0 ) in the present context , should not remain constant .",
    "note that @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be approximated as constant only if the flow remains non - relativistic or ultra - relativistic throughout .",
    "therefore , the existing solutions for such flows with a fixed @xmath1 need to be verified and corrected if necessary with a relativistically correct eos ( see e.g. chandrasekhar 1938 ) .",
    "most of the studies of accretion disks around compact objects have approximated @xmath1 to be constant throughout the flow , which can not be the correct description for the reasons described above .",
    "blumenthal & mathews ( 1976 ) introduced , for the first time to best of our knowledge , variable @xmath1 and proposed an appropriate eos in obtaining solutions for spherical accretion and wind around schwarzschild black holes .",
    "recently , meliani et al . (",
    "2004 ) used their eos and obtained the general solutions for the relativistic parker winds incorporating varying @xmath1 according to the nature of the flow .",
    "ryu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed a new eos suitable for non - relativistic and relativistic regimes with varying @xmath1 , to implement in the simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "very recently , chattopadhyay & ryu ( 2009 ) showed that composition of the fluid plays an important role to determine the value of @xmath1 and then solutions of inviscid spherical flows around black holes .",
    "this would have impact on a hot accretion disk as well which was shown to exhibit significant nuclear burning , producing the variation of compositions in the disk ( chakrabarti & mukhopadhyay 1999 , mukhopadhyay & chakrabarti 2000 ) .",
    "earlier , while chen & taam ( 1993 ) discussed structure and stability of the transonic optically thick accretion disks without restricting the gas and radiation content therein , did not show the actual variation of the gas / radiation content as a function of radial coordinate and then its impact to the solutions .",
    "the present work introduces a self - consistent variation of @xmath1 in solving viscous flows in the accretion disk around black holes .",
    "we essentially concentrate on the region of the flows which is expected to be sub - keplerian in nature .",
    "therefore , following previous work ( muchotrzeb & paczynski 1982 ; abramowicz et al . 1988 ; chakrabarti 1996 ; mukhopadhyay & ghosh 2003 ; rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010a ) we model the flow from the keplerian to sub - keplerian transition radius ( @xmath6 ) to the black hole event horizon ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we plan to concentrate , in particular , the class of flows which is not geometrically very thick , yet sub - keplerian in nature including a nonzero component of advection and gradient of pressure in general . hence , the underlying equations can be integrated / averaged vertically without losing important physics , in obtaining the solutions .",
    "therefore , following previous work ( muchotrzeb & paczynski 1982 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; chakrabarti 1996 ; mukhopadhyay & ghosh 2003 ; rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010a , 2010b ) , we consider vertically integrated infall consisting of gas and radiation . while the flow around @xmath6 might be non - relativistic with a high @xmath1 ( depending on the size of the disk ) , as it advances towards @xmath7 , @xmath1 must be varying .",
    "we plan to investigate , how the self - consistent variation of @xmath1 over the disk radii affects the established solutions with a fixed @xmath1 .    in the next section",
    "we establish the model equations describing flows .",
    "subsequently , we discuss solutions in  3 and finally summarize the results in  4 .",
    "the basic equations describing conservations of mass and momentum in the vertically integrated disk remain same as of earlier works which assumed @xmath1 and then @xmath0 to be constant throughout ( e.g. abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; chakrabarti 1996 ; rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010b ) .",
    "abramowicz et al . (",
    "1988 ) also showed that the geometrically slimmer flow is stable for @xmath8 . for simplicity , following e.g. narayan & yi ( 1994 ) and chakrabarti ( 1996 ) , we assume that the heat radiated out to be proportional to the heat generated by viscous dissipation .",
    "hence , following the same authors , we define a parameter @xmath9 determining the fraction of matter advected in . therefore , we recall the equation describing conservation of energy in the vertically integrated disk from chakrabarti ( 1996 ) and mukhopadhyay & ghosh ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , in reality , @xmath9 should be determined , rather fixing , selfconsistently as done by rajesh & mukhopadhyay ( 2010a ) very recently for hot optically thin flows around black holes . for the present purpose , all the above mentioned equations of conservation",
    "are supplemented by an equation describing the variation of @xmath0 as a function of radial coordinate , assuming a single temperature fluid .",
    "earlier authors ( e.g. chen , abramowicz & lasota 1997 ) already formulated single temperature optically thin disk flows including bremsstrahlung cooling for constant @xmath0 . therefore , without repeating the description of equations of conservation , assuming the flow to be a mixture of perfect gas and radiation ( abramowicz et al .",

    "note that , in the first approximation ( rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010b ) , we do not consider other radiation mechanisms which could be effective in optically thin flows . in a future work ,",
    "such effects e.g. synchrotron radiation , inverse - comptonization could be included , once the present results confirm such a study worth pursuing . with the choice of @xmath26 ( mukhopadhyay & ghosh 2003 ) , we further write @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sound speed of the flow .",

    "however , note importantly that the value of @xmath9 is not arbitrary , rather should be chosen according to the nature of the flow ; whether it is gas dominated or radiation dominated , optically thin or thick .",

    "however , as the flow advances in , the gas flow starts becoming relativistic , rendering the increase of apparent content of radiation which decreases @xmath0 . at @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath0 decreases by @xmath79 , while @xmath1 by @xmath80 .",
    "however , as @xmath81 and then @xmath82 decreases , their variation decreases as well . for @xmath83 , its variation during infall",
    "is only @xmath84 , while for a smaller @xmath81 variation is negligible .",
    "therefore , for a gas dominated flow , the solutions of accretion flows , particularly for vertically integrated geometrically thin / slim disks , with a constant @xmath0 and then @xmath1 as discussed in the existing literature , appear to be incorrect which need to be revised .",
    "figures [ figbeta]c , d show how the variation of @xmath0 affects the disk thermo - hydrodynamics , particularly for gas dominated flows . in general , as @xmath0 decreases at a large distance from the black hole , the content of radiation in the flow increases which leads to a smaller @xmath37 therein .",
    "this is because , the increase of radiation makes the flow to be radiatively more efficient , rendering the disk to be geometrically thinner and then more centrifugally dominated .",
    "hence , ignoring the variation of @xmath0 , when @xmath81 and @xmath59 are high , would make the disk to be gas pressure dominated geometrically thick and quasi - spherical throughout which could reflect a wrong picture . however , at the inner region of the disk , @xmath37 profiles for all @xmath0 merge .",
    "this is because the flow therein is practically controlled by the black hole s gravity .",
    "interestingly , while the flow with a constant @xmath0 ( @xmath85 ) would have a physical solution ( dot - dashed line ) for @xmath86 , the variation of @xmath0 ( with @xmath87 ) , when other initial parameters remain unchanged , leads to an unphysical solution ( solid line ) with an o - type critical point which does not continue from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . however , if @xmath62 decreases slightly ( to , e.g. , @xmath88 ) , then the flow with varying @xmath0 again exhibits a physical solution ( long - short - dashed line ) .",
    "figure [ figbeta]e shows how the relation between @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath28 , i.e. eos , changes with the variation of @xmath0 in the flow",
    ". clearly @xmath89 ( which is practically true for the present purposes ) does not vary linearly with @xmath90 , unlike the cases modeled in the existing literature based on constant @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ figalfa ] we compare the change of variation of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and then corresponding @xmath37 , with the change of @xmath41 .",
    "it is found that the effect of variation of @xmath0 on disk thermo - hydrodynamics is stronger for a lower viscosity . if @xmath59 is fixed , then @xmath0 is higher and its variation is steeper for a lower @xmath41 at a large distance .",
    "higher the @xmath0 , higher the @xmath1 in the flow is , inducing a quasi - spherical gas flow with a faster radial infall which may lead to an unstable / unphysical flow solution at a low @xmath41 . in other words",
    ", a lower @xmath41 corresponds to a lower rate of energy - momentum transfer in the disk .",
    "hence , to describe a steady infall , @xmath0 has to be larger , particularly at a large @xmath31 , which implies a quasi - spherical faster inflow of gas .",
    "therefore , the assumption of a constant @xmath0 and then @xmath1 ( @xmath91 ) would reflect an incorrect solution of the disk flow , particularly for a gas dominated flow .",
    "figures [ figalfa]c , d show that physically interesting solutions , exhibiting flows coming from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , require a smaller @xmath62 than that considered in the literature based on a constant @xmath0 .",
    "this supports quasi - spherical flows .",
    "figure [ figalfa]e compares solutions with different sets of @xmath59 and @xmath41 , and shows that the physical solution is achieved for a smaller @xmath59 , when @xmath41 is lower .    from fig .",
    "[ figa ] we understand how the variation of kerr parameter affects the solutions with varying @xmath0 .",
    "first we consider the maximum possible @xmath62 obtained with constant @xmath0 ( rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010a ) for the respective cases of @xmath19 . interestingly , while the physical solution around a co - rotating ( prograde ) black hole is available ( solid line ) with varying @xmath0 for the same set of parameters as of constant @xmath0 , @xmath62 has to be smaller for a counter - rotating ( retrograde ) black hole ( dotted and dashed lines ) .",
    "this is because a high @xmath81 renders a quasi - spherical gas flow , which requires a smaller @xmath38 allowing the matter to fall inwards .",
    "note that while the maximum possible @xmath62 for a co - rotating black hole itself is smaller , for a counter - rotating black hole it is much larger .",
    "hence , the allowed range of @xmath62 is shrunk for a counter - rotating black hole compared to that inferred from the analysis based on a constant @xmath0 . for clarity , in figs .",
    "[ figa]c , d we also show the @xmath37 and @xmath38 profiles for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( respectively dot - long - dashed and dashed - long - dashed lines ) with a constant @xmath0 for maximum possible values of @xmath62 . figure [ figa]e shows how the eos changes with the variation of @xmath19 , when @xmath0 varies in the flow .",
    "clearly @xmath94 does not vary linearly with @xmath90 , unlike the cases with constant @xmath1 .",
    "note that dashed and dashed - long - dashed lines practically overlap each other , implying that the solution with a constant @xmath0 is recovered by decreasing @xmath62 in the case of varying @xmath0 .",
    "we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ figbeta ] that the variation of @xmath0 is negligible for the radiation dominated flows .",
    "this is because a small @xmath0 corresponds to a radiatively efficient geometrically thinner flow , which effectively corresponds to a relativistic flow of radiation throughout .",
    "therefore , as the matter advances , the black hole s gravity has nothing to affect especially .",
    "however , close to the black hole , @xmath37 increases noticeably and the corresponding infall time scale of the matter decreases significantly , rendering a quasi - spherical flow which increases @xmath0 by @xmath95 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figrad ] .",
    "figure [ figradcomf ] shows that the variation of @xmath9 keeping other parameters intact does not affect hydrodynamic properties , e.g. mach number , significantly .",
    "however , as @xmath9 increases , the flow tends to become radiatively inefficient , rendering an increase in @xmath0 significantly close to the black hole .",
    "therefore , any ( observed ) property related to the inner accretion flow must be influenced by @xmath9 and hence the variation of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a stronger variation of @xmath0 and then @xmath1 in optically thin flows , compared to its optically thick counter parts . as seen in fig .",
    "[ figbr1 ] , while for a high @xmath81 , the variation of @xmath0 could be @xmath96 and of @xmath1 be @xmath97 , for a low @xmath81 , the respective variations are much higher , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in all the cases depicted here , as @xmath38 decreases around @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ figbr1]d ) , rendering the flow to be quasi - spherical , @xmath0 increases as the flow advances in .",
    "subsequently , centrifugal force starts increasing , which renders the increase of @xmath38 and rate of cooling , which decreases @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , close to the black hole , due to the dominance of gravitational force , matter falls very fast , rendering the flows , irrespective of @xmath81 , to be quasi - spherical with high @xmath0 . therefore , unlike our conventional thought that highly relativistic flow in the vicinity of a black hole may exhibit low @xmath0 and then @xmath1 as seen in optically thick flows , in optically thin cases with bremsstrahlung radiation the situation is different . this is because the inefficient / incomplete cooling process ( rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010a ) keeps the flow to be very hot and then quasi - spherical until inner edge when the infall time is very short .",
    "it is very clear from eoss shown in fig .",
    "[ figbr1]e that @xmath94 does not vary linearly with @xmath90 , unlike the conventional cases .",
    "figure [ figbr2 ] shows that the self - consistent inclusion of variation of @xmath0 and then @xmath1 , for both the gas and radiation dominated flows , renders the unphysical solutions ( solid lines ) , when the corresponding solutions with constant @xmath0 and then @xmath1 ( dotted lines ) appear physical .",
    "it is very clear that at around @xmath98 , the value of @xmath1 varies sharply with radius , rendering the flow to be gas dominated quasi - spherical with an unphysical o - type critical radius .",
    "however , the flow with a smaller @xmath62 ( dashed lines ) , keeping other parameters unchanged , exhibits the physical solution , even with varying @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the decrease of @xmath38 favors the quasi - spherical nature of gas dominated flow at around @xmath99 , giving rise to a physical solution . in general , the specific angular momentum of the flow , more specifically @xmath62 , is smaller in a realistic flow with varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 than that with the idealistic choice of constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ figgascomf ] shows that the variation of @xmath9 keeping other parameters intact neither affects hydrodynamic properties nor @xmath0 profiles .",
    "however , at a very high @xmath9 ( @xmath100 , advection dominated flow ) , other parameters should not be kept same and @xmath0 must be larger .",
    "such a flow is represented by long - dashed lines . however , this still does not alter the mach number profile significantly . note also that the flow with @xmath101 strictly at a large distance does not exhibit any variation of @xmath0 even at a smaller radius , which renders the corresponding @xmath102 , to be ratio of specific heats throughout .",
    "therefore a strict adaf solution remains unaltered .",

    "we have , in one hand , considered radiation to be optically thick blackbody in the geometrically thin / slim vertically integrated disks . on the other hand ,",
    "we have also considered optically thin geometrically thicker flows in the assumption of bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "hence , as matter advances towards a black hole , the ratio of the gas pressure to total pressure and the corresponding polytropic index vary significantly with the radial coordinate . we have found that in several occasions , the accretion solutions as obtained with a constant @xmath0 by the earlier models do not exist when @xmath0 is allowed to vary self - consistently .",
    "it has a very important implication when most of the existing models of accretion disks assume @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be constant throughout the flow .",
    "for example , an advection dominated class of solution , namely adaf ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; quataert & narayan 1999 ) , has been modeled based on gas dominated flows with a constant @xmath1 ( @xmath107 ) throughout , when @xmath1 is chosen to be ratio of specific heats .",
    "other models ( e.g. abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; chakrabarti 1996 ; rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010a ) , describing gas dominated optically thin flows , as well have assumed @xmath1 , which is polytropic index therein , to be constant . in the present work",
    ", the impact of varying @xmath1 has been particularly demonstrated in the framework of later model .",
    "note , however , that polytropic index turns out to be a ratio of specific heats only when the flow is of pure gas with @xmath102 .",
    "the results argue for correction to the earlier models based on constant @xmath0 , when particularly @xmath0 varies more than @xmath108 during the infall of an optically thin gas dominated matter .",
    "hence , the present results imply that the entire branch of optically thin hot solutions of accretion disk needs to be re - investigated including appropriate variation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . however , for simplicity we have considered the optically thin radiation arising due to bremsstrahlung mechanism only , neglecting synchrotron , inverse - comptonization which are likely to operate in the inner hot regime of the flow .",
    "however , inclusion of such effects would only favor the present results . in future",
    ", we have plan to include such physics in studying very hot flows .",

    "<S> we investigate the variation of the gas and the radiation pressure in accretion disks during the infall of matter to the black hole and its effect to the flow . while the flow far away from the black hole might be non - relativistic , in the vicinity of the black hole it is expected to be relativistic behaving more like radiation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure ( @xmath0 ) and the underlying polytropic index ( @xmath1 ) should not be constant throughout the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that accretion flows exhibit significant variation of @xmath0 and then @xmath1 , which affects solutions described in the standard literature based on constant @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> certain solutions for a particular set of initial parameters with a constant @xmath0 do not exist when the variation of @xmath0 is incorporated appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> we model the viscous sub - keplerian accretion disk with a nonzero component of advection and pressure gradient around black holes by preserving the conservations of mass , momentum , energy , supplemented by the evolution of @xmath0 . by solving the set of five coupled differential equations , we obtain the thermo - hydrodynamical properties of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we show that during infall , @xmath0 of the flow could vary upto @xmath2 , while @xmath1 upto @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this might have a significant impact to the disk solutions in explaining observed data , e.g. super - luminal jets from disks , luminosity , and then extracting fundamental properties from them . hence any conclusion based on constant @xmath1 and @xmath0 should be taken with caution and corrected .    ,    accretion , accretion disk  black hole physics  equation of state  gravitation  hydrodynamics </S>"
