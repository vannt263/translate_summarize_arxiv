    "in the past decade untargeted ( `` blind '' ) surveys revealed the existence of new types of transients .",
    "a good example is the case of superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) : despite of being at least an order of magnitude brighter than `` normal '' supernovae @xcite , slsne were not discovered before 2005 , presumably because of the absence of their birthplaces ( low - luminosity galaxies and/or galaxy cores ) in the pre - selected target lists of earlier transient surveys @xcite .    the texas supernova search ( * ? ?",
    "* tss ) discovered the first two slsne , sn  2005ap @xcite and sn  2006gy @xcite that became prototypes of two distinct subclasses within slsne ( see @xcite for details on discoveries ) .",
    "its successor , the rotse supernova verification project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rsvp ) , continued to find slsne , e.g. sn  2008am @xcite or sn  2008es @xcite . both surveys used most extensively the 0.45-m rotse - iiib telescope at mcdonald observatory , texas . although the target fields covered mostly rich galaxy clusters closer than @xmath4 mpc , the majority of the discovered transients ( @xmath5 to date ) occured in significantly more distant , background galaxies .",
    "the details of the search and detection strategies are described in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of yet another unusual transient , detected with rotse - iiib in the course of rsvp in 2009 .",
    "the internal name of the transient was _ dougie _ , but sometimes it was also designated as rotse3j120847.9 + 430121 .",
    "although the early light curve ( lc ) and the first spectra taken with the 9.2-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) suggested a new slsn , follow - up spectroscopic observations did not reveal any broad spectral features , which is unusual even among slsne that sometimes show peculiar spectral evolution .",
    "instead , the spectra continued to show only a smooth , cooling continuum up to a month after discovery . at the last epochs when the transient was detected , narrow features due to the presumed host galaxy started to appear , then the transient faded below the het detection limit .    subsequent spectroscopic observations with the keck telescope confirmed the existence of the host galaxy at redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "this redshift corresponds to a distance of @xmath6 mpc , which , when combined with photometric data , implies an observed absolute peak brightness of @xmath7 mag , similar to that of the brightest slsne ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) . here",
    "we present a detailed account of the unique observational properties of _ dougie _ as well as an in depth description of various model alternatives for its origin .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 the photometric and spectroscopic observations for both the transient and the host galaxy are presented . in ",
    "3 four alternatives for _ dougie _ s origin are explored : a core - collapse supernova , a ns - ns merger , a grb jet observed off - axis and a tidal disruption of a low - mass stellar object by the central supermassive black hole , the latter of which is favored by the data .",
    "finally , in  4 we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "during its normal course of operation at mcdonald observatory , texas , rotse - iiib detected a new object at r.a.= @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , dec.= @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the first detection occured on mjd 54852.31 ( 2009 jan 21 ut 07h 26 m 24s ; ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , supplemented by the next detection at ut 07h 52 m 24s confirming the presence of the new object . at the time of discovery the apparent brightness of the transient was @xmath12 mag ( all rotse - iiib unfiltered magnitudes",

    "the flux depression between 2500 - 3000   appearing after + 25 d might be due to the broad uv - features observed in the spectra of the slsn ps1 - 10bzj @xcite and the tde candidate ps1 - 11af @xcite ; however , the resolution provided by the broadband _ swift _ uv filters are not adequate to unambiguously identify these features .",

    "contrary to the early - phase spectrum in the left panel , this late - phase spectrum of _ dougie _ is redder than the other slsne at similar post - peak phases .",

    "the broad sn features might have appeared only at later times when the transient faded below the het detection limit .",

    "we then register the _ swift _ frames to the sdss r - band frame of the same area by matching the positions of common point sources on both frames .",
    "next , we determine the coordinates of _ dougie _ on the registered _ swift _ frames and compared them to those of the photometric centroid of the host galaxy as measured on the sdss r - band frame . the results are shown in fig .",

    "appears to be systematically offset , about 1.2 `` east and 0.4 '' south from the center of the host , in both observed epochs . adopting the wcs of the sdss frame",
    ", we measure the final position of _ dougie _ as r.a.= @xmath57 ( @xmath9 ) , dec.= @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we note that the uncertainties for _ dougie _ plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pos ] are conservative @xmath60-pixel errors of the _ swift _ frames that may overestimate the true errors of the photo - centers .",
    "the coordinate uncertainties given above are in between the @xmath60-pixel errors and the measured frame - to - frame shift of the photometric center of the ot ( @xmath61 pixel ) on the _ swift _ frames .",
    "based on our _ swift _ observations , we infer that _ dougie _ appears to be slightly off - center from its host galaxy .",
    "the total angular distance from the photo - center of the host is @xmath62 arcsec , corresponding to @xmath63 kpc linear distance for the adopted redshift ( @xmath28 ,  2.4 ) .",
    "the bolometric lightcurve ( lc ) of the transient was assembled by integrating the host - corrected uv+optical seds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) over wavelength .",
    "the fluxes in the far - uv were estimated by linearly extrapolating the spectrum until 1000  . in the ir ( longward of 8000  ) ,",
    "a rayleigh - jeans tail starting from the reddest observed flux was assumed to calculate the integrated ir contribution to the total quasi - bolometric flux .    the temporal coverage of the lc was refined by adding more data points from the rotse @xmath13-band and swift @xmath24-band lcs ( fig .  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "this was justified by the close similarity between the shape of the lcs at optical wavelengths . to do this , the observed rotse- and swift magnitudes",
    "were converted to absolute magnitudes using a @xmath29 mpc luminosity distance , then the luminosity curve was calculated from these absolute magnitudes as if they were bolometric magnitudes , which is equivalent of assuming bc = 0 mag bolometric correction .",
    "although this seems like a rather crude approximation , the resulting lc ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bolom ] ) looks consistent with those obtained from sed integration .",
    "the peak bolometric luminosity of _ dougie _ is thus estimated to be @xmath64 erg s@xmath32 , while the integrated radiated energy is calculated to be @xmath65 erg .",
    "in this section we consider four models for the origin of _ dougie _ : core collapse supernova , merging neutron stars , off - axis grb models and the tidal disruption of a star by the central supermassive black hole .",
    "these are presented in detail in the following subsections .",
    "although the lack of sn features in the optical spectra does not support the core collapse hypothesis , the lc look rather similar to those of slsne . for this reason , in the absence of spectral information",
    "one could have naturally deduced that _ dougie _ might have resulted from the death of a massive star that was recently formed in the host galaxy .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bolom ] we compare the bolometric lcs of _ dougie _ with those of several slsne .",
    "the data of the latter objects were analyzed by @xcite where the reader may find the references to the data .",
    "it is seen that _ dougie _ showed faster lc evolution than most of the well - observed slsne .",
    "the rise - time to peak , @xmath66 days , was similar to that of ptf09uj , a luminous type iin sn @xcite .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ fig : bolom ] shows , the peak luminosity of _ dougie _ clearly puts it into the slsn regime .",
    "in this subsection we make an effort to describe the lc using simple sn radiative diffusion models to ascertain whether or not they can provide a reasonable description of the bolometric lc . following the formalism developed by @xcite , we test three different core collapse scenarios : a _ ni - co _ radioactive decay model , a magnetar model @xcite and a shocked , circumstellar medium ( csm ) model .",
    "the best - fit representations of the lc are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bolom ] .",
    "all three models assume that the energy is deposited at the center of an optically - thick sphere , promptly thermalized , and then slowly transported out by photon diffusion . in the radioactive decay and magnetar modes we assume homologous expansion of the sn ejecta ( which is taken into account when solving the diffusion equation ) , while in the csm model we assume a fixed , opaque csm cloud whose interior is thermalized at a designated time .",
    "the fast rise and decay of the observed lc can be fit only using a relatively short effective diffusion timescale , which corresponds to a low ejecta mass in all three scenarios .",
    "the high peak luminosity , on the other hand , requires very large internal energy to be readily available . in the radioactive decay model ,",
    "in particular , the derived diffusion timescale , @xmath67 days , implies @xmath68 for @xmath69 @xmath70  g@xmath32 and @xmath71 km  s@xmath32 , while the large peak luminosity demands a ni - mass @xmath72 . in the magnetar model",
    ", the early peak requires a short ( @xmath73 days ) spin - down timescale which , in turn , requires a relatively large magnetic field strength of about @xmath74 g for an initial 10 ms spin period .",
    "moreover , the magnetar model also needs a relatively low - mass ejecta ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) , but a very extended initial radius of @xmath77 cm .",
    "in addition , this model requires the internal energy to be injected near the edge of the very tenuous sn ejecta to avoid significant adiabatic degradation .",
    "the csm model gives a more physically consistent picture with a required total shocked energy of about @xmath78 erg ( compatible with the explosion energy of a typical sn ) deposited within a csm cloud of about @xmath79 @xmath76 . in this scenario",
    "_ dougie _ resembles to ptf09uj @xcite , i.e. the luminosity is due to the conversion of shock kinetic energy into thermal energy within the opaque , dense csm .",
    "the higher luminosity of _ dougie _ might be explained by the larger kinetic energy and denser , more massive csm than in the case of ptf09uj .",
    "however , the weakness of this hypothesis is that , unlike in ptf09uj , there is no indication for any shock - generated emission lines in the spectra of _ dougie _ , which are ubiquitously observed in interacting type iin sne . in principle",
    ", the lack of hydrogen and/or helium emission lines might be consistent with the presence of a h / he - free , o - rich csm around the transient , but the lack of _ any _ kind of spectral feature during the whole observed period makes this hypothesis less feasible .",
    "the other important observational constraint that argues against the core - collapse slsn scenario is the nature of the host galaxy (  2.5 ) .",
    "there is growing evidence that h - free slsne tend to appear in metal - poor , dwarf galaxies that show intense star formation rates and extremely strong emission lines @xcite .",
    "since the host of _ dougie _ appears to be dominated by older populations of stars without any sign of enhanced star formation , these observed properties of the host galaxy strongly argue against the slsn nature of _",
    "dougie_.      merging neutron stars ( ns - ns mergers , or `` merger - novae '' )",
    "are thought to be promising candidates for producing fast , luminous transients @xcite .",
    "recently , the rapid optical transient ptf11agg @xcite was proposed to be due to such a phenomenon @xcite . in this model",
    "the merging of two neutron stars due to gravitational wave radiation is speculated to produce , in some cases , a rapidly spinning , hypermassive , magnetized neutron star @xcite surrounded by a more - or - less spherical , fast - expanding ( @xmath80 ) envelope , the mass of which is @xmath81 @xmath76 .",
    "the magnetar wind is assumed to efficiently dissipate poynting flux within the expanding envelope , heating it and accelerating it to relativistic speed ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the dilution of the envelope due to expansion causes the thermalized photons to escape on timescales anywhere between hours and days depending primarily on the mass of the surrounding envelope and its expansion velocity .",
    "thus , the basic physical configuration , to some extent , is similar to the magnetar model considered in  3.1 .",
    "the main difference being the mass of the ejected envelope , which in the sn model is at least an order of magnitude larger .",
    "while the stable , hypermassive neutron stars model could produce lcs with shapes that are qualitatively similar to that of _ dougie _ , i.e. rapid rise followed by slower decline , the calculations by e.g. @xcite and @xcite show rise times that are significantly shorter ( typically between 10 hours - 1 day ) than the @xmath0 days observed rise time of _ dougie_. this is essentially due to the smaller ejected mass in the ns - ns merger systems and its corresponding higher expansion velocity . as it was shown in  3.1 , the observed lc of _ dougie _",
    "needs @xmath83 days , which is almost a factor of 10 longer than the typical diffusion timescales expected in ns - ns merger systems .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the predictions of the merger model are not compatible with the observed lc of _",
    "dougie_.      given that most gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are collimated into narrow jets , their observed properties will unavoidably vary depending on the angle @xmath84 from their symmetry axis at which they are observed . if _",
    "dougie _ were a grb , then at least its gamma - ray emission directed at us was certainly extremely weak .",
    "a plausible interpretation might be that the _ dougie _ was a typical grb seen at an angle , @xmath84 , larger than the opening angle of the central jet , @xmath85 .",
    "if we assume a homogeneous sharp - edged jet , the burst seen by all observers located within the initial jet aperture , @xmath86 , is practically the same , but beyond the edges of the jet the emission declines precipitously @xcite . when @xmath87 , there is no detectable prompt emission and the accompanying early afterglow is weak , owing to relativistic beaming of photons away from the line of sight . as the lorentz factor decreases with time",
    ", an off - axis observer will see a rising afterglow light curve at early times peaking when the jet lorentz factor reaches @xmath88 and approaching that seen by an on - axis observer at later times .",
    "this is because an observer will receive most emission from those portions of a grb blast wave that are within an angle 1/@xmath89 to the direction to the line of sight such that the emission for an off - axis observer will remain at a very low level until the doppler cone of the beam intersects the observer s line of sight .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the @xmath86 and @xmath90 light curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : oag ] .",
    "the off - axis grb interpretation of _ dougie _ requires the viewing angle to have been @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oag ] ) , similar to the parameters determined by @xcite for ptf11-agg . the afterglow light curves at @xmath92 hz presented here",
    "are calculated using the afterglow models of @xcite by applying the boxfit code . in these models ,",
    "the expansion of the grb jet in a uniform medium with density @xmath93 is calculated using relativistic hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the local emissivity is computed using the conventional assumptions of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons that are accelerated behind the shock into a power - law distribution ( @xmath94 ) , where the electrons and the magnetic field hold fractions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , of the internal energy of the shocked fluid @xcite .",
    "one question that naturally arises is whether the observed multi - wavelength evolution can be explained within the framework of this model .",
    "even though the model fits the optical light curves moderately well , it is inconsistent with the observed sed and , in addition , predicts significantly higher x - ray fluxes when compared with the _ swift_/xrt upper limits .",

    "dougie_.      the tidal disruption of an approaching star by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) has become a popular mechanism for explaining the bright , slowly evolving x - ray / uv / optical `` flares '' from luminous transients ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "tdes are characterized by the following basic quantities : smbh mass @xmath97 , stellar mass @xmath98 , stellar radius @xmath99 , and the impact parameter , the ratio of the tidal radius @xmath100 to the distance of the closest approach @xmath101 , as @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "when the debris from a disrupted star falls back to the smbh , it first forms an elliptical accretion disk from which matter circularizes via a combination of mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the fallback rate @xmath103 is thought to be characterized by a range of power law values @xmath104 , where @xmath105 depends on the star s structure and the impact parameter @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the conversion of the fallback into light is not expected to directly follow @xmath103 , especially for individual bands @xcite . as gas accretes onto the black hole",
    ", radiation pressure may expel some fraction of the mass if the accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit of the black hole , @xmath107 .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , a wind may be produced that carries a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy @xcite . for cases in which the accretion rate remains sub - eddington , the disk component likely becomes the dominant source of radiation , peaking in the far uv to soft x - ray bands ; however , previous tde candidates have shown evidence of significant reprocessing of the emergent light into longer wavelengths with an sed characterized by a single blackbody , rather than the sum of blackbodies expected for an accretion disk @xcite .    even in the observed bands , which do not include the peak in the sed at early times ( see fig",
    "[ fig : sp ] ) , the peak luminosity of dougie , @xmath108 ergs s@xmath32 , is larger than the eddington limit of a @xmath109 black hole . additionally , dougie s time of peak is significantly shorter than the time of peak predicted from @xmath103 alone , which for a @xmath110 black hole is on the order of a month for main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "both of these aspects suggest that if _ dougie _",
    "is indeed a tidal disruption event , its observational appearance near peak must be dominated by a wind component whose functional form may not directly reflect @xmath103 .    to model",
    "_ dougie _ , we modified the tdefit code initially described in @xcite to include a wind component that can carry a significant fraction of the accretion energy .",
    "the appearance of a tde when its accretion rate exceeds eddington has been explored by a number of authors @xcite . for super - eddington accretion rates ,",
    "these models presume a fraction of the incoming mass is ejected in the form of a wind , which moves out at some velocity that is comparable to the orbital velocity at the tidal disruption radius",
    ". if the majority of the energy carried by the wind is internal , the radiative output can be significantly less than the energy input , as much of the energy will be expended as work as the wind expands @xcite .",
    "if the excess energy is instead mostly carried kinetically , but then dissipates near the photosphere , the radiative output can be comparable to the energy input .    while these works provide descriptions of the relevant wind physics in the decline phase , they do not provide formalisms that are general enough to model _ dougie _ over its full evolution : rise , peak , and decline .",
    "additionally , each model has a particular prediction for the power - law relationship between @xmath103 and the photosphere s properties .",
    "as an example , _ dougie _ shows a clear decrease in temperature as a function of time after peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] ) , whereas @xcite and @xcite predict a temperature increase until the event drops below the eddington limit .",
    "@xcite , by contrast , do predict a slight temperature decrease after peak .",
    "[ fig : tdelc ] shows the comparison of the r - band lc of _ dougie _ with that of another tde - candidate , ps1 - 10jh @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the two events had markedly different light curves : _ dougie _ showed a much faster and more energetic outburst than ps1 - 10jh .",
    "modeling of ps1 - 10jh has shown that a standard thin - disk alone is not capable of fitting the event s light curve @xcite , but that a large fraction of the disk s light needs to be intercepted by a reprocessing region to adequately match observations .",
    "we propose that the reprocessing region intercepts a fraction , @xmath111 , of the disk radiation .",
    "the reprocessing region is likely to be hydrostatic when the accretion rate is sub  eddington , but to become dynamic and unbound when the eddington limit is exceeded .",
    "the subsequent dynamic expansion then releases energy that originates from a combination of the radiation from the disk and radiation from the expanding reprocessing region , @xmath112 we assume @xmath113 is capped at the eddington luminosity , and @xmath114 is equal to the fraction of reprocessed disk light plus a fraction @xmath115 of the eddington excess , @xmath116 where we have presumed that the maximum amount of energy released in the form of an outflow is given by the energy release at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , @xmath117 , where the black hole efficiency @xmath118 depends solely on the black hole s spin parameter @xmath119 . as in @xcite",
    ", we do not presume an _ a priori _ time - dependence of the photosphere on @xmath103 , its optical depth @xmath120 , its size @xmath121 , or its temperature @xmath122 , but rather leave these as free parameters . because this model does not presume a particular power - law relationship between @xmath103 and the reprocessing region s properities",
    ", the model space includes the specific power - law index proposed in @xcite and @xcite , which would be favored by the markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) optimization if they are able to reproduce dougie s observed evolution .",
    "one simplification made here is that we presume the power - law relationship between @xmath103 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is constant throughout the event , regardless of whether the event is above or below the eddington limit , whereas @xcite and @xcite advocated a transition at the eddington limit .",
    "we find that such a transition is not necessary to produce satisfactory fits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tde1 ] ) , but relaxing this assumption may improve fit quality .    beside the parameters described above ( @xmath123 , @xmath98 , @xmath106 , @xmath119 , @xmath121 , @xmath120 and @xmath115 ) the model also includes the following additional parameters",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for more complete description ) : the power - law index @xmath124 in the relationship @xmath125 ; the disk inclination angle @xmath126 ( @xmath127 indicating face - on ) ; the disk viscosity parameter @xmath128 ; the polytropic index @xmath129 of the disrupted star ( either @xmath130 or @xmath131 ) ; the hydrogen column density @xmath132 within the host galaxy ; the reddening - law parameter @xmath133 .",
    "we assumed that the time - lag between the disruption and the first detection is @xmath134 ( in days ) , and we added @xmath135 variance ( in magnitudes ) to the model light curves .      in table",
    "[ tab : tde ] we show the median values resulting from our maximum - likelihood analysis .",
    "as expected , the short peak timescale and high luminosity of _ dougie _ favors a low mass black hole , although there is very large scatter in the favored black hole mass ( @xmath136 ) so that the black hole mass might be as large as @xmath137 .",
    "if we assume that the host galaxy s light is dominated by a bulge component , the black hole mass it would possess based on the @xcite relation would be @xmath138 ; however as the galaxy is sb type , its bulge fraction may be as low as @xmath139 @xcite , suggesting a central black hole mass of a few @xmath110 .",
    "this value is within the scatter of the black hole mass distribution found here .",
    "another possibility is that the tidal disruption occurred about a secondary , smaller black hole in the process of merging with galaxy s primary black hole , which would also explain the tde s slight offset from the host s center .",
    "lower mass ( @xmath140 - @xmath141 @xmath76 ) black holes , even off - center ones , although rare , are not unprecedented .",
    "a good example is in ngc  3341 , where recent merging resulted in two off - center nuclear sources ( at @xmath73 and @xmath142 kpc from the center of the massive disk galaxy ) , one of them being a seyfert-2 nucleus @xcite .",
    "another lower mass accreting bh ( @xmath143 @xmath76 ) was recently discovered in the central region of the dwarf starburst galaxy henize 2 - 10 @xcite .",
    "the more recent detection of a radio outburst from the ultra - luminous x - ray source hlx-1 in eso 243 - 49 may be due to a jet ejection from an intermediate - mass ( @xmath144 - @xmath145 @xmath76 ) bh @xcite .",
    "as illustrated by these examples , the off - center position ( @xmath146 kpc ) of _ dougie _ , as well as the bh mass derived in the tde - model , are not unrealistic , and may be consistent with the tde - hypothesis .    a number of differences in _ dougie _ s highest - likelihood parameters are apparent when comparing to fits of ps1 - 10jh .",

    "the observed lc suggested a peak luminosity of @xmath205 erg s@xmath32 , which is similar to those of the most luminous slsne .",
    "simultaneous x - ray observations with _ swift _ resulted in no detected x - ray emission on the co - added _ xrt _ frames spanning the whole duration of the follow - up observations .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up observations showed that the spectra of the transient were unusual : between 4000 and 9000   it did not show any spectral feature that could be attributed to the transient , during the whole observed interval .",
    "the weak narrow features in the late - time spectra were identified as due to the host galaxy . at early times",
    "the spectra consisted of a hot , blue continuum ( @xmath206 k ) , which later cooled down , but could not be described as a single blackbody from the uv to the red .",
    "the softening of the spectra suggested a cooling , expanding , sn - like ejecta , but the lack of spectral features during the entire observed time domain argued against the sn - hypothesis .",
    "the proposed host galaxy , sdss j120847.77 + 4320.1 , is a faint sb - type galaxy , without any previously detected uv / x - ray emission , and without any sign of ongoing star formation .",
    "the transient appeared @xmath62 arcsec off - center , corresponding @xmath207 kpc linear distance from the photo - center of the host ( 2@xmath191 ) .",
    "despite the similar peak luminosity , it is unlikely that the transient was a super - luminous supernova .",

    "the magnetar - powered , and the csm - interaction - powered slsn models can be tweaked to produce a similar lc , but the difference between the usual spectra of these kind of transients and that of _ dougie _ does not support the slsn hypothesis . also , the lack of ongoing star formation within the host galaxy is not typical for galaxies producing h - poor slsne , as those slsne tend to appear in metal - poor hosts showing intense star formation .",

    "the tidal disruption scenario was explored by fitting the event to an amended version of the model presented in @xcite .",
