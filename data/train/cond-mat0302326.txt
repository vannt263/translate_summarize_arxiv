    "charge ordering is a general phenomenon in condensed matter physics that has been recently observed in a variety of compounds including rare earth manganites@xcite , quasi - one - dimensional @xmath4 conductors@xcite , cuprate or nickelate materials@xcite .",
    "a very particular form of charge order in these latter materials is the formation of _ charge stripes _ , that are domain walls between hole rich and hole poor regions . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "charge ordering is a crystallization of the electron liquid which occurs when long - range coulomb repulsion@xcite dominates over kinetic energy . in one dimension ,",
    "charge ordering and more generally metal - insulator transitions can be studied in great details due to the existence of powerful analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite methods . in the case of a one - dimensional system ,",
    "the simplest model@xcite of interacting electrons that allows for charge ordering is the hubbard model extended with an additional nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath5 .",
    "studies of the metal insulator transition in one dimension show that charge ordered or mott insulating states can form at commensurate fillings for sufficiently strong repulsion@xcite . in relation with organic compounds , the quarter - filled extended hubbard model on a single chain has been studied in details@xcite . as a first step towards understanding charge ordering and stripe formation in strongly correlated electron models ,",
    "numerical studies of coupled chain systems at commensurate fillings @xcite ( ladders ) have also been performed .",
    "half filled ladder systems are mott insulators that display a spin gap analogous to the haldane gap in spin-1 chains@xcite when made of an even number of coupled chains .",
    "ladder models are not only of theoretical interest .",
    "quite a few half - filled ladder systems have been synthesized both organic and inorganic and the spin gap behavior has been characterized in great details  @xcite .",
    "away from half - filling and more generally commensurate filling , ladders are expected to be conducting .",
    "the persistence of the spin gap away from half - filling has been proposed to give rise to a paring mechanism and to superconductivity@xcite .",
    "this suggestion has given rise to intense theoretical studies both analytical@xcite and numerical @xcite that confirmed the presence of superconducting correlations at incommensurate fillings .",
    "experimentally , the two - leg ladder compound @xmath6@xcite can be doped away from half filling and under pressure displays a superconducting transition .",
    "recently , the compound @xmath7 , initially identified as an inorganic spin peierls compound@xcite , was shown to be a quarter - filled ladder@xcite , that undergoes a transition at @xmath8 corresponding to the formation of a charge ordered state with a zig - zag charge pattern and the opening of a spin gap@xcite .",
    "this has prompted numerical studies of quarter - filled extended hubbard two - leg ladder systems@xcite that exhibit the formation of a zig - zag charge ordered state at large repulsion .",
    "interestingly , the charge ordered state of the two - leg ladder at quarter filling presents a spin gap in contrast to the single chain .",
    "analytic studies of insulating states on a two - leg ladder have been mostly confined to the half - filled case@xcite or to mean field@xcite approximations and strong coupling expansions@xcite in the quarter - filled case . in the present paper",
    "we analyze the phase diagram of the quarter - filled two - leg hubbard ladder with interchain coulomb repulsion @xmath1 and exchange coupling @xmath0 , by using bosonization and renormalization group ( rg ) methods .",
    "focusing on the regime of strong repulsion , we discuss charge orders and the elementary excitations of the insulating phase .",
    "due to the presence of a spin gap , the competing ground states are bond - order wave states ( bow ) and charge density wave states ( cdw ) .",
    "we analyze the phase transitions between these states using a perturbative renormalization group approach and a mapping of spin excitations to a majorana fermion theory .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] we introduce the model and discuss the physics of two simple limits , the large on - site repulsion and the large interchain exchange limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonization ] we give the details of the bosonization treatment and of the derivation of the renormalization group ( rg ) equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] we introduce the order parameters of the insulating phases and the describe the charge ordered ground states obtained by the values of the phase fields that minimize the energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : excitations ] we describe the elementary charge and spin excitations of each ground state and discuss the analogy with kondo - heisenberg - hubbard chain in a particular case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we discuss the nature of the transitions among the various phases in the antisymmetric charge sector and the spin sector .",
    "this is partially accomplished by a mapping to a theory of majorana fermions and by a mapping to an effective quantum ising model in the limit of strong interchain repulsion .",
    "finally , we discuss the results of the phase diagram obtained by the numerical integration of the rg equations .",
    "we also briefly discuss the commensurate - incommensurate transitions produced by the application of a magnetic field or by doping away from quarter - filling .",
    "we consider the quarter - filled extended hubbard model on a two leg ladder .",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the site index , @xmath13 the chain index , @xmath14 the intrachain hopping , @xmath15 the interchain hopping , @xmath16 the on - site repulsion , @xmath17 the nearest - neighbor repulsion , and @xmath1 the interchain repulsion .",
    "since we will be focusing on the case of very strongly repulsive interactions , the single - particle interchain hopping term @xmath15 will be irrelevant in this regime .",
    "however , it is well known that even when @xmath15 is irrelevant , it generates an interchain exchange term in the hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : latt - hubbard ] ) should also include an interchain exchange term , @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in the limit of @xmath20 , @xmath0",
    "is estimated to second order perturbation theory in @xmath21 as @xmath22 . in the following",
    ", we will consider the hamiltonian ( [ eq : latt - hubbard ] ) completed by the term ( [ eq : interchain - exchange ] ) and neglect altogether the interchain hopping @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , another model of interest is the two leg t - j ladder at quarter filling .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model reads : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an operator that projects onto singly occupied states@xcite .",
    "we will thus treat @xmath0 as a parameter independent of @xmath25 in ( [ eq : latt - hubbard ] ) in order to be able to discuss also results relevant to the two - leg @xmath26 ladder model . in the rest of the present section",
    ", we will illustrate two simple limiting cases of the problem defined by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : latt - hubbard])  ( [ eq : interchain - exchange ] ) which display insulating charge ordered ground states .",
    "let us begin by considering the limit @xmath27 in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : latt - hubbard])([eq : interchain - exchange ] ) .",
    "in this limit , it is not possible to put two fermions on the same site even when they have opposite spins and from the point of view of charge excitations , the system behaves as if it was made of spinless fermions with a fermi wavevector @xmath28 twice the one of the spinful fermions at @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the original spinful fermions system being quarter - filled , the spinless fermions system is half - filled and its effective hamiltonian reads : @xmath30 where now @xmath31 .",
    "the bosonization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : latt - tv ] ) is straightforward .",
    "the relevant formulas can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "we obtain the following bosonized hamiltonian : @xmath32 where @xmath33 represent the intrachain umklapp interactions .",
    "let us first consider the case in which these processes are irrelevant ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : latt - tv ] ) has then a luttinger liquid ground state for @xmath34 , and the renormalized luttinger exponent @xmath36 can be obtained from studies of the @xmath37 model @xcite as : @xmath38 in the luttinger liquid regime , we can set @xmath39 and replace @xmath40 by @xmath36 in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : bosonized - spinless ] ) provided @xmath1 is sufficiently small .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : bosonized - spinless ] ) , is then decoupled by introducing the fields @xmath41 leading to the following hamiltonian : @xmath42 + \\frac{2v_\\perp a } { ( 2 \\pi a)^2 } \\int dx   \\cos \\sqrt{8 } \\phi_r,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and : @xmath44 for @xmath45 , the term @xmath46 is relevant and opens a gap in the charge modes .",
    "if @xmath47 , this implies that the gap opens as soon as @xmath48 , whereas the intrachain umklapp processes become relevant only for @xmath49 .",
    "we thus see that for a wide range of @xmath50 , although intrachain repulsion @xmath17 alone is too weak to open a charge gap by itself , the existence of a nonzero interchain repulsion is sufficient to induce an insulating ground state .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical observation of a charge gap state forming for @xmath51 and @xmath52 at large @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that insulating state",
    ", the charge gap should vary as @xmath53 .",
    "+ we note from ( [ eq : k - v - t ] ) that @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 , i.e. the hamiltonian ( [ eq : decoupled - spinless ] ) is identical to the bosonized hamiltonian of the half - filled 1d hubbard chain , @xmath56 playing the role of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 playing the role of @xmath59 . as a result , although the total charge mode is gapful , the antisymmetric charge mode remains gapless .",
    "this insulating state presents the same @xmath60 symmetry as the hubbard model .",
    "in particular , the gapped charge excitations behave like those of the half - filled hubbard model and the charge gap is @xmath61 .    to determine the long range order that is realized in the ground state , we need to fix the values of @xmath62 that minimize the classical ground state energy , i. e.",
    "require that @xmath63 is negative .",
    "since the density of the spinless fermions reads : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the chain index , this leads to two out of phase charge density waves of wavevector @xmath66 on chains 1 and 2 , i.e. a zig - zag charge ordering .",
    "this ordering is represented on figure  [ fig : zig - zag ] .",
    "we note that in ref .  , it was found that the charge ordering was formed for @xmath67 only when @xmath68 although a charge gap was obtained for @xmath51 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy in ref .   could be the presence of @xmath69 . turning to transport properties , from ( [ eq : spinless - density ] ) the long wavelength density on chain",
    "@xmath13 is @xmath70 . by considering the topological charge of the sine - gordon models ( [ eq : decoupled - spinless ] ) , one easily obtains that a charge solitons carries the electrical charge @xmath71 .",
    "the a.c . electrical conductivity of this system can be obtained from the form factor expansion @xcite .    when @xmath72 , the interchain umklapp processes become relevant and induce the formation of charge density waves on each chain@xcite .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 is to lock the respective phases of these charge density waves into a zig - zag pattern .",
    "zig - zag charge ordering is thus ubiquitous in the limit @xmath67 .      in the limit",
    "in which @xmath73 in ( [ eq : latt - hubbard])  ( [ eq : interchain - exchange ] ) or in ( [ eq : tj - hamiltonian ] ) , it is again possible to derive a simplified hamiltonian in a low - energy subspace .",
    "namely , one can restrict to a subspace in which fermions form spin singlet pairs on the same rung .",
    "these pairs can then be treated as hardcore bosons@xcite moving on a single chain and carrying a charge @xmath74 . for a quarter",
    "filled fermion system , the effective boson system is at half - filling .",
    "the effective bosonic hamiltonian reads : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , annihilates a singlet pair on site @xmath12 . in the limit @xmath77",
    ", the coefficients @xmath78 can be obtain from second order perturbation theory as @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : eff - large - jp ] ) is solved exactly by the bethe ansatz@xcite , and its spectrum has a gap for @xmath51 .",
    "a bosonization description@xcite of the low energy excitations of this system gives : @xmath81 -\\frac{2\\delta}{(2\\pi a)^2 } \\int dx \\cos 4\\phi_b,\\ ] ] where the mode @xmath82 describes the charge excitations of the hardcore boson system .",
    "the electrical charge density is given by : @xmath83 in the gapped regime , @xmath84 , and the ground state of this system is formed of singlet pairs in a charge ordered state as represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : pizerocdw ] .",
    "we therefore see that in the regime of strong interaction , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 will induce a charge ordering .",
    "however , @xmath0 favors a phase with stripes formed along the rungs of the system , whereas @xmath1 favors a zig - zag charge ordering . as a result",
    ", the competition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 induces a frustration in the system that can lead to a variety of charge ordering patterns .",
    "in the present section , we derive a bosonized representation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : latt - hubbard])([eq : interchain - exchange ] ) in the limit @xmath85 . for @xmath86 , the chains are decoupled , and the hamiltonian describing their low energy , long wavelength excitations reads : @xmath87 \\\\ \\label{eq : decoupled - spin }   h_{\\sigma ,",

    "the most relevant umklapp operator compatible with this symmetry is @xmath123 , and it should be the operator responsible for the opening of the gap in the charge modes at quarter - filling . as a result ,",

    "concerning the intrachain umklapp terms , they are of the form @xcite @xmath125 and become relevant only for @xmath126 .",

    "this term reads : @xmath423    if all the fermions belong to the same chain(@xmath424 ) , one recovers the term @xmath425 derived in ref .  . for the case",

    "let us begin with @xmath435 .",
    "if we have a system of fermions with both spins up and down , we can write the following expression@xcite for the spin density : @xmath436 expressing these quantities in terms of @xmath437 , forming the difference and taking into account the term @xmath438 in the hamiltonian , we obtain the expression : @xmath439 since the hamiltonian of spin excitations contains a term @xmath438 , new terms will be generated by fusion of this operator with @xmath435 . for @xmath440 odd",

    "we see easily that by fusion with @xmath452 , the terms in @xmath453 with @xmath450 odd will be reduced to @xmath454 while the terms with @xmath450 even will be reduced to @xmath368 .",
    "the expression of @xmath455 therefore reduces to : @xmath456 we can check that the expressions we have obtained lead to rotational invariant expression of the spin correlations for @xmath92 , provided that @xmath457 for all @xmath440 .",
    "( [ eq : s - z - phen])-([eq : splus - phen ] ) can also be derived from a more physical argument .",
    "the ogata - shiba wavefunction tell us that in the limit of @xmath94 , the spin excitations can be described as a `` squeezed '' antiferromagnetic spin chains , the spins being carried by the electrons@xcite .",
    "the spin density should therefore be described by the following expression :",
    "@xmath458 where the @xmath459 are the positions of the electrons along the chain , labelled in such way that @xmath460 .",
    "the vector @xmath461 can be decomposed into a staggered and a uniform component as @xmath462 .",
    "we will assume that both @xmath463 and @xmath464 are slowly varying at the scale of the average interparticle distance so that we can write : @xmath465 , @xmath466 , the functions @xmath467 , @xmath468 varying smoothly between the points @xmath469 .",
    "we note that the integral from @xmath470 to @xmath471 of @xmath472 is the total magnetization operator and also the generator of the rotations .",

    "the corresponding expression reads : @xmath475 let us now introduce a function @xmath476 such that @xmath477 .",
    "we can rewrite the delta function as : @xmath478 and we have : @xmath479 .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath480 since @xmath476 must be @xmath481 each time that there is a particle , we have that @xmath482 , from which we easily obtain : @xmath483 . using the bosonized expressions  ( [ eq : spinchain ] ) of @xmath472 and @xmath473 in terms of @xmath453 the expressions ( [ eq : s - z - phen])-  ( [ eq : splus - phen ] )",
    "are then easily seen to be equivalent to ( [ eq : spin - pheno ] ) . applying the expression ( [ eq : spin - pheno ] ) to our problem",
    "we see that the terms coming from the @xmath93 component of the spin density are less relevant and read : @xmath484 the contribution of these terms to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : full ] ) can thus usually be neglected being less relevant .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath0 sufficiently large , a gap may be formed in the modes @xmath485 at higher energy scale than in @xmath486 . in that case , the terms we have derived can lead to a modification of the coefficient @xmath114 of the term @xmath128 in ( [ eq : charge - hamiltonian ] ) and a change of the ground state expectation value of @xmath111 from @xmath487 to @xmath488 if @xmath0 is large enough .",
