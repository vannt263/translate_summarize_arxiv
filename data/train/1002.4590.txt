    "the interest in the problem of position - dependent mass ( pdm ) systems has been growing in the last years , both from the non - relativistic and the relativistic point of view @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , there are many applications to different problems of physics like quantum dots @xcite , compositional graded crystals @xcite , quantum liquids @xcite , metal clusters @xcite , neutron stars @xcite , among others . in particular , recently the wigner function for some classes of position - dependent schroedinger equations were constructed and analyzed in the one - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "the approach used in that work is capable to generate a class of position - dependent mass systems , which is isospectral to a given exactly solvable potential with constant mass . in this work",
    ", we will extend that approach to higher dimensions",
    ". moreover , as far as we know , the majority part of the works dedicated to the research of pdm systems @xcite , deals with one - dimensional systems .",
    "although , there are physical systems like those where a magnetic field @xcite is present , which leads naturally to the need of a two - dimensional analysis . finally , to our knowledge , no work in this subject has discussed the case of pdm in the presence of magnetic fields . in this work",
    ", we intend to partially fill this gap .",
    "the method will be applied to the case of the anisotropic two - dimensional harmonic oscillator as well as in the case of those systems under the influence of some non - homogenous external magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath0 coherent states will be constructed for a number of systems which we choose to illustrate our results .    in order to get the exact solutions for the two - dimensional schroedinger equation we trace two routes .",
    "we begin by performing a general spatial variables change in the case of systems which are not under the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "then , in the case of magnetic interaction , we begin by performing a time - dependent variable transformation followed by the spatial transformation . in the first case",
    ", we consider three examples of real variable transformations , which are respectively : the so - called polynomial one , the one using elliptic cylindrical coordinates and , finally , the bipolar coordinates transformation .",
    "once we have the exact solutions for the eigenstates of the schroedinger equation , we proceed with the construction of the @xmath0 coherent states @xcite .",
    "these last allow us to acquire a notion of the respective classical behavior of those position - dependent massive particles , similarly to what happens with the wigner functions in one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in the section 2 we present the approach we are going to use . then , in the section 3 we apply it to some special mass dependencies , constructing classes of two - dimensional pdm systems which are isospectral to the anisotropic bi - dimensional harmonic oscillator . in the section 4 ,",
    "the case of magnetic field is taken into account .",
    "finally we trace our final comments in the section 5 .",
    "in this section we present the approach which is capable to generate a class of models with position - dependent masses from a constant one , and which can also include the interaction with a magnetic field . in this case",
    "the two - dimensional schroedinger equation is given by @xmath1 where the constant @xmath2 is the mass of the particle in the original system , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the corresponding spatial coordinates , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the respective momenta .",
    "furthermore , we will work with magnetic fields in the coulomb gauge , where @xmath7 .",
    "now , performing a general variable transformation in the spatial coordinates as @xmath8 one gets @xmath9 which can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the jacobian matrix , and its jacobian is @xmath12 , from which it can be written that @xmath13 after straightforward calculations , one can obtain the following expression for the laplace operator in the transformed coordinates , @xmath14 +   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{j}\\left [ g_{v}\\,\\partial _ { u}\\left ( \\frac{g_{v}}{j}\\right ) -g_{u}\\,\\partial _ { v}\\left ( \\frac{g_{v}}{j}\\right ) + f_{v}\\,\\partial _ { u}\\left ( \\frac{f_{v}}{j}\\right )",

    "note that the equation ( [ eq4p ] ) once solved leads to @xmath20 provided that @xmath21 . by substituting ( [ eq4r ] ) in ( [ eq4q ] ) , one gets @xmath22 thus , from ( [ eq4s ] ) we conclude that @xmath23 substituting ( [ eq4 t ] ) in ( [ eq4r ] ) , one obtains @xmath24    in fact , in all the cases considered here , the terms linear in the derivatives in the transformed laplace operator ( [ eq4o ] ) vanish .",
    "moreover , the transformation will keep @xmath7  for all the cases considered .",
    "thus the schroedinger equation in those transformed variables is written as @xmath25 \\psi \\left ( u , v\\right ) = e~\\psi \\left ( u , v\\right ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath26    with @xmath27 .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we will first deal with two - dimensional position - dependent systems which are isospectral to the anisotropic harmonic oscillator and , then , with the ones which are isospectral to the case of a isotropic harmonic oscillator under the influence of homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "as advertised , the first example which we will present here is the one of the anisotropic oscillator with constant mass governed by the equation @xmath28    in this case the eigenfunctions can be straightforwardly obtained , and are given by    @xmath29 ,   \\label{eq4tt3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    at this point",
    "we could make a study of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the pdm systems which are isospectral to this one .",
    "however , we prefer to construct the so - called @xmath0 coherent states , as defined in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "those states present the interesting feature of having their highest probability density over a trajectory which corresponds to the classical one when @xmath34 . furthermore , as the eigenstates , they are stationary wave - functions in contrast with the usual coherent states . as we are going to see , they will lead us to the conclusion that the isospectral pdm states will present a behavior which is very similar to the one of their  parent \" anisotropic harmonic oscillator . those coherent states can be written by using the definition introduced by chen et al . @xcite-@xcite    @xmath35    where the quantum numbers are defined as @xmath36 @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 being integer numbers . the complex parameter is such that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , written in terms of polar coordinates , is used in order to make the connection with the classical trajectory .    from now on , we will devote this section to develop explicit examples . as our first example of transformation functions , we deal with the second degree polynomials like    @xmath43    after imposing the restrictions ( [ eq4p ] ) and ( 8) , we are led to    @xmath44    where one can see that only four arbitrary constants are left , and one have that    @xmath45    and the laplace operator becomes    @xmath46 = \\frac{1}{(c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2})(u^{^{2}}+v^{2})}(\\partial _ { u}^{2}+\\partial _ { v}^{2 } ) ,   \\label{eq4m1}\\ ] ]",

    "moreover , we conduce our study by computing the so called @xmath106 coherent states , which are specially interesting wave - packets which present their maximum of probability over the classical trajectory juliano2,1chen2003,3chen2003,chen2004 . as particular examples of variable transformation , we used a polynomial example as well as the cases of the cylindrical elliptical and the bipolar coordinates .    in the case of a charged particle under the effect of pure homogeneous external magnetic field",
    ", despite the fact that the we are dealing with time - dependent wave - function solutions , it was verified that the corresponding @xmath0 coherent states do not present dependence in the time variable . in that case , the maximum of the probability density is over a circle .",
