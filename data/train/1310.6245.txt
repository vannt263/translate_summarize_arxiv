    "the main drawback of the analysis is their dismissal of the radiative levitation of silicon . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the radiative levitation of silicon in the atmospheres of da white dwarfs with 17,000  k @xmath3,000  k could affect the determination of accretion rates in white dwarfs when one uses the accretion - diffusion model . by carrying out time - dependent diffusion calculations that included radiative levitation and accretion",

    "a steady - state is reached when the number of silicon atoms that are accreted is equal to the number of atoms that diffuse downward .",
    "a silicon abundance equilibrium is reached at each depth even though the atoms continue to diffuse downward .",
    "this abundance equilibrium is possible , because silicon atoms are continuously replenished by accretion as they diffuse downward .",
    "the dotted curves show that the abundances depend on the accretion rates , so a measure of the abundance at the surface of a white dwarf can be related directly to the accretion rate . by performing a linear interpolation on the accretion rates at the abundances observed in wd  0421 + 162 and",
    "wd  0431 + 126 , i estimated accretion rates of @xmath38 and 4.9 , respectively .",
    "these accretion rates are essentially equal to those of determined by assuming the accretion - diffusion model .    in the presence of radiative levitation ,",
    "however , the observed silicon abundances can not be simply related to the accretion rates .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ wd_comp_acc ] by the solid curves that give the steady - state abundances computed in the presence of accretion and radiative levitation .",
    "the difference between the dotted and solid curves is obvious above the depths @xmath14 , where the radiative support is important .",
    "the main difference is the appearance of a silicon reservoir that results from the equilibrium between the upward radiative acceleration and the downward gravitational acceleration of silicon . at low accretion rates ,",
    "the equilibrium abundances are essentially given by the radiative levitation alone .",
    "in particular , the lower panel of figure  [ wd_comp_acc ] shows that the surface abundance predicted by the radiative levitation matches the silicon abundance observed in the atmosphere of wd  0431 + 126 . the abundance predicted by the radiative levitation holds on even in the presence of accretion with rates up to @xmath39 ( g  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ wd_comp_acc ] shows , on the other hand , that the radiative levitation alone can not explain the observed silicon abundance in wd  0421 + 162 .",
    "the figure shows that the radiative levitation can support an abundance close to @xmath40 , which is much lower than the observed abundance .",
    "the figure indicates that an accretion rate of @xmath41 is necessary to maintain the observed silicon abundance .",
    "it is noteworthy that this accretion rate is smaller than the accretion rate ( @xmath38 ) needed when the radiative levitation is neglected .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the effects of the radiative levitation on the downward diffusion of silicon .",
    "as silicon is accreted and diffuses downward , the radiative levitation slows down its downward diffusion and helps to maintain a larger amount of silicon in the upper layers of the star .",
    "after having demonstrated that radiative levitation has an impact on the calculations of silicon accretion rates in stars such as wd  0421 + 162 and wd  0431 + 126 , we can address the issues that raised with the interpretation of the radiative levitation .",
    "we will review their arguments and see whether they are appropriate in the light of the current and past calculations .",
    "their first argument against radiative levitation was the fact that the cooler of the two stars had a higher silicon abundance , in contrast to the prediction of the levitation theory .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ wd_comp_acc ] shows that radiative levitation alone can not support the whole amount of silicon that is maintained in the atmosphere of wd  0421 + 162 .",
    "accretion must be at work to supply the additional silicon .",
    "this instance demonstrates that both accretion and radiative levitation are at work simultaneously to maintain silicon in the atmosphere of the star . in this case , even though accretion is the dominant mechanism to maintain silicon , radiative levitation nevertheless contributes to the support of silicon .",
    "the second problem that raised concerns the low silicon abundances that are observed in seven stars , which are part of their cos snapshot survey ( gnsicke et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to , these stars have silicon abundances @xmath42 and should have a greater radiative support than the one predicted in the stars wd  0421 + 162 and wd  0431 + 126 .",
    "it is difficult to comment on these stars , because did not give any specific informations on the uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "@xcite report the silicon abundances , but do not provide any information on the stars atmospheric parameters .",
    "what i can say , though , is that the silicon abundances predicted by the radiative levitation theory are sensitive to temperature and gravity , especially in the temperature range of the two hyades white dwarfs . in this temperature range ,",
    "the predicted silicon abundances decrease rapidly as the temperature decreases .",
    "a slight change in temperature or gravity could change significantly the predicted silicon abundances .",
    "therefore , detailed radiative levitation calculations that include uncertainties on the stellar atmospheric parameters could shed light on this issue .",
    "the observations of the seven stars for which the abundances are lower than the predicted abundances could also indicate that other phenomena are at work at the surface of the stars .",
    "for example , the assumption that accretion is spherically symmetric could be wrong .",
    "we could imagine matter that is accreted and forced to follow a star s magnetic field .",
    "this matter would then pile up at its magnetic poles . in this case ,",
    "measured abundances would be underestimated and would not match predicted abundances . another plausible phenomenon that could have an effect on predicted abundances is turbulence .",
    "although turbulence is not well understood at the surface of white dwarfs , its effect would disrupt radiative levitation , and consequently , affect predicted abundances .",
    "s third argument concerns the presence of silicon during the earlier phases of the two hyades white dwarfs .",
    "argue that silicon was not supported by radiative levitation during the whole cooling period of the stars , and therefore it must be external .",
    "the calculations carried out in  [ diff_calculations ] demonstrate that silicon does not need to be primordial in order to be supported by radiative levitation .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ wd_comp_acc ] shows that very low accretion rates can provide the necessary silicon .",
    "for low accretion rates , the predicted abundance in a star such as wd  0431 + 126 will be the abundance maintained by radiative levitation",
    ". figures  [ sigrad ] and [ wd_comp_acc ] show that whether silicon is external or primordial , once it is in the atmospheres of the two white dwarfs , it will definitely be subject to radiative levitation .    finally , mention that previous results from radiative levitation have not yet been quantitatively successful for white dwarfs with @xmath43,000  k. indeed , @xcite concluded that the equilibrium radiative levitation theory fails to account for the observed abundances .",
    "this conclusion lead @xcite to point out , however , that other mechanisms must be simultaneously at work in these stars .",
    "they suggested mechanisms such as weak stellar winds , turbulence , and accretion that could compete with gravitational settling and radiative levitation .",
    "they emphasized that in spite of the failure of the equilibrium radiative levitation theory at explaining the observed abundances , radiative levitation can not be ignored in hot white dwarfs and must be included as a basic ingredient in more elaborated models . as we have seen in ",
    "[ silicon ] , this fact applies to silicon in wd  0421 + 162 and wd  0431 + 126 .",
    "according to models presented here , the silicon abundances observed in the atmospheres of the da white dwarfs wd  0421 + 162 and wd  0431 + 126 can not be directly related to the composition of the accreted matter , because radiative levitation plays an important role in supporting silicon .",
    "the amount of silicon observed in the atmosphere of wd  0431 + 126 could be entirely supported by radiative levitation , although a small amount of silicon could be accreted . in the star wd  0421 + 162 ,",
    "the observed silicon abundance is significantly higher than the abundance predicted by the radiative levitation , so accretion of silicon must be invoked . as silicon",
