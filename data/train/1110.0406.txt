    "recent experiments on ultracold fermi gases @xcite , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms , have shifted our perspective on superfluidity and confirmed earlier ideas about fermionic paring @xcite .",
    "the extent of possible experimental control in these gases has led to a large body of experimental work on fermionic pairing phenomena .",
    "most notable is the ability to apply a controlled magnetic field to tune the strength of the attractions @xcite . in balanced mixtures of fermions ,",
    "this tunability is exploited to study the crossover from a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecules to a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid @xcite .",
    "the bcs regime involves a small negative scattering length wherein fermions form weakly bound cooper pairs , while in the bec regime the scattering length is positive and particles form tightly bound molecular pairs .",
    "however , in the case of imbalanced mixtures of spin - polarized fermi gases @xcite , the study of the phase diagram is more interesting @xcite . in this case , many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have been reported . in the experiments ,",
    "a controllable number of atoms prepared in one spin state can transfer to the opposite spin state by applying a radio - frequency pulse . in these polarized systems ,",
    "all atoms in the less populated spin state are found to pair up with atoms in the opposite spin state , constituting a molecular condensate that coexists with the remaining fermi sea of the unpaired atoms .",
    "as the repulsive interaction between these atoms and the molecules increases , a phase separation occurs between the superfluid ( sf ) and the normal ( n ) phase @xcite .",
    "such a phase - separation scenario had been proposed by clogston @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite long ago , who predicted the occurrence of a first - order transition from the n to the sf state .",
    "since the existence of a n - sf interface may settle some important questions regarding polarized fermi mixtures , serious research has been focused on this subject @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been established @xcite that a temperature difference between the two phases can appear as a consequence of the blockage of energy transfer across the n - sf interface .",
    "this blockage is due to a sf gap , which causes low - energy normal particles to be reflected from the interface . by studying particle scattering off the interface ,",
    "the heat conductivity has been also calculated .",
    "we may mention in passing that the heat conductivity has been calculated in other polarized fermi systems , such as the spin - polarized superfluid fermi liquid @xcite , where a phase separation does not occur .    in this article",
    "we examine the n - sf interface of a polarized fermi gas in the presence of a weak orbital magnetic field , which is produced fictitiously , for example , by rotating the gas @xcite . under rotation",
    ", the neutral system behaves like a charged system in a magnetic field .",
    "another way to produce fictitious magnetic fields is via vortex nucleation @xcite .",
    "also , when a neutral system moves in a suitably designed laser field , it can mimic the dynamics of a charged particle in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we use perturbation theory to solve the bogoiubov equations and obtain the wave functions .",
    "we consider the various scattering regions of the bcs regime associated with different energies of the incident particle / hole and analytically obtain the transmission coefficients and the heat conductivity across the interface . for definite choices of the field , considering various values of the scattering length in the bcs range and taking andreev",
    "reflection into account , we describe how the heat conductivity is affected by the orbital field and the species population imbalance .",
    "in particular , we show that the additional heat conductivity due to the orbital field increases with the species imbalance at higher temperatures .",
    "our results indicate how the heat conductivity may be controlled , which is relevant to sensitive magnetic field sensors / regulators at the interface .",
    "we consider a fermi gas consisting of two imbalanced species @xmath2 and @xmath3 , each with mass @xmath4 , effective charge @xmath5 and chemical potential @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "( the external trapping potential is assumed to be zero . )",
    "the hamiltonian operator in the presence of the orbital magnetic field is ( @xmath8 ) @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the average and the species - imbalance chemical potentials , respectively . treating the vector potential as a perturbation",
    ", we may use the first order perturbation theory to solve the bogoliubov equations @xcite . denoting the particle - like and hole - like solutions by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the solutions to the unperturbed ( @xmath17 ) bogoliubov equations and @xmath18 is the pair potential .",
    "we use the approximation that @xmath19 is independent of @xmath20 and by suitable choice of @xmath21 ( see later ) the contribution of its component perpendicular to the sf boundary can be made negligible .",
    "thus , and using the london gauge ( @xmath22 ) , one finds that @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the bogoliubov equations then read : @xmath24 the second set of bogoliubov equations is obtained by simply interchanging @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear from these equations that the incoming @xmath2-particles are coupled to @xmath3-holes and vice versa . to proceed ,",
    "let us take the n - sf interface to be in the @xmath25 plane . introducing the superscript @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) for the solutions in the sf ( n ) phase , we expand @xmath28 in terms of the unperturbed eigenfunctions .",
    "the latter are @xmath29 $ ] for the n phase , and @xmath30 $ ] for the sf phase , where @xmath31 refers to particle , hole and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) denotes the component of the wave vector @xmath34 parallel ( perpendicular ) to the interface .",
    "notice that @xmath35 appears as a subscript ( superscript ) for the n ( sf ) phase throughout our notation . from the unperturbed bogoliubov equations we have the usual relations @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "thus , for the n phase , we write @xmath38 as for the sf phase , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 . substituting ( [ expn ] ) into ( [ bogo ] )",
    ", we can use the orthonormality of @xmath43 s to extract the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain , after some calculations , @xmath46 where @xmath47\\cdot \\bm{a } \\nonumber \\\\ f_\\pm^{(q)}=e+h\\pm[\\mu-\\frac{1}{2m}(k_\\parallel^2+k^{(q)^2})].\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our calculations we have naturally supposed that for @xmath48 , @xmath49\\cdot \\bm{a } = 0.\\ ] ] ( the integrand , then , does not pertain to a single entity ( particle / hole ) and is thus irrelevant as far as the transmission of particles / holes is concerned . )",
    "the amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 are to be determined by matching the wave functions and their derivatives at @xmath25 , of course .",
    "this is deferred to the next section .",
    "consider an incoming @xmath2-particle from the n side with energy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . because there is no correction to the energy to lowest order in @xmath21 @xcite , in view of ( [ k ] )",
    ", there are different scattering regimes involved in the @xmath54 plane .",
    "these regimes are obtained by the crossover of either of the @xmath55 or @xmath32 from real to imaginary values ( or vice versa ) , signifying a change in the scattering mechanism as described below @xcite :    \\i ) for @xmath56 , the incoming particle has insufficient energy to excite the sf side . in this case",
    "we have total reflection .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the incoming particle is reflected .",
    "\\iii ) for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , only quasi - particles are excited in the sf .",
    "\\iv ) for @xmath61 , particle - like and hole - like excitations both occur in the sf side but andreev reflection @xcite is forbidden .",
    "\\v ) for @xmath62 , we have particle - like and hole - like excitations as well as normal and andreev reflections .    because in regions i and ii the particle has insufficient energy to excite the sf side , the transmission coefficients in these regions vanish .",
    "moreover , our focus is on energies slightly above the transmission threshold ( @xmath63 ) , because we are considering low temperatures ( see later ) .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on regions iv and v. we proceed to obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 by matching the wave functions and their derivatives . for region",
    "iv we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 similar equations are obtained for region v. these equations yield the scattering amplitudes @xmath66 for general @xmath67 . denoting the @xmath68-component of the current density by @xmath69 ,",
    "the transmission coefficient is given by @xmath70 , where the superscripts t and i refer to the transmitted and incident quasi - particle current densities , respectively .",
    "the general form of @xmath71 ( for channel @xmath72 ) is @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{e}{m}[u^\\star_a(\\bm{r})u_a(\\bm{r})+v^\\star_b(\\bm{r})v_b(\\bm{r})]\\bm{a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using ( [ n ] ) and ( [ expn ] ) we obtain , to first oder in the perturbation , @xmath74 \\label{w}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the transmission coefficient in the absence of the vector potential and @xmath76 in the computations ( which are performed analytically throughout ) we use @xmath77 as we are considering the @xmath72 channel .",
    "note that only energies slightly above the transmission threshold contribute to the first integral , which affects the region of integration .",
    "we also need to make a definite choice for @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ matrix ] ) then yields very complicated analytical expressions for the scattering amplitudes that reduce to the results of @xcite in the absence of the vector potential .",
    "substituting these in ( [ a ] ) gives the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we take @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constants .",
    "( this particular choice renders analytical computation possible . ) equation ( [ w ] ) leads to @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) refers to region iv ( v ) . @xmath85",
    "coincide with the results of @xcite in the absence of the vector potential ( @xmath86 ) , which are also proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "we remark that only a tiny portion of region iv ( corresponding to @xmath88 slightly above @xmath89 and , of course , @xmath90 slightly above @xmath91 ) contributes to @xmath83 .",
    "similarly for holes , we obtain results for the region v with @xmath92 .",
    "this is because from our calculations , holes incident on the interface can only transmit in region v.    analogous procedure applied to incoming @xmath3-particles and @xmath2-holes ( the @xmath93 channel ) yields identical results to the above but with @xmath94 .",
    "for each channel , the heat conductivity is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is fermi - dirac distribution , which , for sufficiently low temperatures @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) , reduces to @xmath99 ( up to a proportionality constant ) .",
    "this implies that the relevant range of energies is only slightly above the threshold @xmath100 , as mentioned before .    using ( [ cond ] )",
    "we find @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the heat conductivity in the absence of the external field and @xmath103 is the additional term due to the vector potential in the sf side .",
    "the effect of the vector potential in the n side on @xmath103 is of second order and , therefore , negligible .",
    "its effect on @xmath102 is to add a small term proportional to @xmath102 itself .",
    "this does not change the temperature dependence of @xmath102 and only causes a small shift in the @xmath104 curve ( figure 3 of reference @xcite ) , which we neglect .",
    "also , in our calculations we have neglected the energy carried by the @xmath93-channel because it is quite lower than that carried by the @xmath72-channel .",
    "our final expression for @xmath103 is @xmath105    by fixing the values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 using the gap and number equations @xcite , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath108 ( @xmath109 , heat conductivity in the normal phase ) as a function of @xmath110 in the bcs regime ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .",
    "the effect of the vector potential is simply a shift of the heat conductivity curve .",
    "we have plotted the figure in the range @xmath113 , where the shift is more pronounced . also in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot @xmath114 versus @xmath110 , for various values of @xmath79 .      as seen , at fixed @xmath115 , the larger the value of @xmath79 , the larger is the heat conductivity .",
    "however , at temperatures roughly below @xmath116 the effect of the vector potential is negligible .",
    "moreover , the curves show an increasing heat conductivity , with a rate that decreases substantially after around @xmath117 . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the dependence of @xmath114 on @xmath107 at fixed temperature for various values of @xmath110 .      to obtain this plot ,",
    "we have first fixed @xmath118 ( @xmath2 , the scattering length ) . using the gap and number equations ,",
    "we then fix @xmath119 ( such that it lies in the bcs range ) which fixes the values of @xmath107 , @xmath106 and @xmath120 .",
    "as seen , in the specified temperature range , @xmath103 does not change significantly with @xmath107 at lower temperatures but decreases as the temperature is raised .",
    "notice also the ( almost ) collapse of the data points , showing that the graph is roughly independent of the temperature as long it is high enough .",
    "we also show , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the dependence of @xmath114 on @xmath106 at fixed temperature for various values of @xmath110 .",
    "again , @xmath103 does not change significantly at lower temperatures but now increases ( in contrast to the previous figure ) as the temperature is raised .",
    "similarly , the graph is roughly independent of the temperature for high enough values . since @xmath106 can be controlled by the species population imbalance ,",
    "the graph shows how the effect of the weak magnetic field on the heat conductivity may be controlled .      widest label l. luo , b. clancy , j. joseph , j. kinast and j.e .",
