    "the formation of solute - rich precipitates in a super - saturated solid solution is a process of great technological importance because it gives raise to precipitation hardening in a wide class of alloys . among the precipitation hardened al alloys ,",
    "the al - mg - si ( 6xxx ) alloys belong to the most studied with regards to their precipitation sequences , see ref .   and references therein .",
    "they often display a complex sequence of metastable phases forming under different conditions ( time , temperature and composition ) .",
    "the structures of almost all of these phases are known in detail from transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) studies . however , such techniques give no direct information about the energetics of the phases of interest .",
    "first - principles calculations can provide vital new information in this respect , as has recently been demonstrated in the case of the al - mg - si system , see work by derlet _",
    "et al_@xcite and ravi and wolverton.@xcite thus , by means of solving the schrdinger equation within the density functional theory ( dft ) , one can obtain enthalpies , and study relaxation and binding , in phases which are meta - stable and only exist as nano - sized particles within the host matrix .",
    "a limitation of direct first - principles calculations is that , in practice , the structure has to be specified in advance .",
    "a central and unresolved question in the case of the al - mg - si system is the structure of the first precipitates that form from solid solution , i.e. , the guinier - preston ( gp ) zones.@xcite    in order to be able to study coherent precipitate phases within the al matrix , and to model the disordered phase and the nucleation process , we have utilized a ternary cluster expansion ( ce ) description of the al - mg - si system . in this model , a set of atoms within a lattice structure is denoted by @xmath5 , and the total energy of such a configuration can be written as a sum of `` cluster functions '' , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 we derive the cluster interaction parameters @xmath8 from a set of first - principles calculations using an approach based on the structure inversion method ( sim).@xcite once these parameters have been obtained , it is a relatively inexpensive operation to sum up the total energy .",
    "a complication that arises is that the effective cluster interactions are in principle volume dependent,@xcite but since the concentration of mg and si in typical al - mg - si alloys is @xmath9% , we have done all calculations at volumes corresponding to the al equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "we have focused on the two main candidates for early precipitate structures , or gp - zones , in the al - mg - si system .",
    "these are , the mg@xmath0si@xmath0 l@xmath1 structure proposed by matsuda _ et al_,@xcite here referred to as the matsuda structure , and the so called pre-@xmath4-phase which was proposed by marioara _",
    "et al_.@xcite by testing a large number of structures related to the pre-@xmath4 structure , we conclude that the matsuda - phase is the energetically most stable precipitate phase .",
    "we then proceed with studying the stability of the matsuda and pre-@xmath4 structures and find that the former structure is dynamically unstable , so that the vibrational free energy is undefined .",
    "this implies that it can only exist within a surrounding stabilizing lattice , the al lattice in this case .",
    "that this system exhibits instabilities is not surprising since fcc si is dynamically unstable.@xcite for certain local concentrations of si we therefore expect the lattice to be significantly softened , which lowers the gibbs free energy , and may lead to structural transformations .",
    "the ce method also allows for large - scale monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to be performed , either for finding ground - state structures ( using , e.g. , simulated annealing ) or to study finite - temperature thermodynamic properties of an alloy .",
    "our mc calculations using the present ce parameters show that decomposition typically occurs in the form of spherical precipitates with the matsuda structure .",
    "mc simulations in combination with thermodynamic integration are used to calculate the solvus phase boundary in the al rich end of the phase diagram .",
    "we also use kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations to study clustering in the disordered phase .",
    "such studies are of current interest because modern experimental techniques , i.e. , high- resolution transmision electron microscopy and 3d atom probe tomography , are capable of studying small , coherent clusters at an atomic scale.@xcite therefore , increased understanding of atomic level processes that preceed nucleation can be expected and a much more detailed comparison with modelling and simulation is possible.@xcite    the paper is disposed as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the two gp - zone models considered in this work . in sec .",
    "iii we review the theory of ternary ce , and we also detail the first - principles calculations that form the basis for the present work . the results of the fitting procedure , and of the ce calculations for different gp - zone structures are presented in section iv .",
    "the calculation of the solvus boundary for mg@xmath0si@xmath0 and simulations of the early stage of clustering are presented in the same section . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the present results in the light of what is experimentally known about gp - zone formation in al - mg - si , and conclusions follow in sec .",
    "currently there are two generally accepted models of the early precipitate phases , or gp - zones , in the al - mg - si alloys .",
    "the first structure , an mg@xmath0si@xmath0 l@xmath1 phase ( see fig [ fig : gp]b ) was observed by matsuda and co - workers  @xcite in samples with a solute concentration of 1.55 at.% and with a mg : si ratio of 2:1 . the samples had been aged and then heat - treated at 343 k. this phase will be referred to as the matsuda phase .",
    "the other structure , the pre-@xmath4 in fig .  [ fig : gp]a was proposed by marioara et al .",
    "@xcite based on tem observations of samples that had been homogenized at 843 k and heat treated at 450 k. the mg : si ratio in these samples was 5:6 .",
    "the @xmath4 structure is the most efficient hardening phase in the 6xxx alloys .",
    "the fact that gp - zones have been observed to have the same symmetry as the @xmath4 phase , motivated the structural model of gp - zones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gp]a.@xcite its structural relationship with the @xmath4 phase can be understood in the following way . if the @xmath10 mg atom in fig .",
    "[ fig : gp]a is displaced @xmath11 in the normal ( @xmath12 ) direction , one obtains a structural model of the @xmath4 phase .",
    "the latter phase is in turn needle - shaped , and often observed to be coherent in the @xmath13 plane and semi - coherent in the @xmath12 ( needle ) direction .     in the @xmath12-direction , with respect to the white atoms .",

    "b ) the matsuda l@xmath1 structure with composition mg@xmath0si@xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]",
    "the general theory for multicomponent ce was developed by sanches , ducastelle and gratias.@xcite in the present work we use the following notations .",
    "a lattice site @xmath14 can be occupied by an atom of type @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 , indicated by an occupation variable , @xmath18 , taking the value @xmath19 , 0 , or @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "hence , given an underlying lattice , the alloy structure can be defined by a set of occupation variables , @xmath21 .",
    "linearly independent basis vectors describing the occupation are then @xmath22 a cluster @xmath23 is defined as a set of lattice sites @xmath24 . given a cluster @xmath23 , a cluster function is defined as the the product of the basis vectors , @xmath25 where the sequence @xmath26 is called `` decoration '' , which in the ternary case will consist of 1:s and 2:s .",
    "the total energy is given by , and by considering the average of cluster functions for symmetry - equivalent cluster - decoration pairs , @xmath27 , the total energy can be re - written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a reference energy and @xmath27 is an average , defined as @xmath30 the sum goes over all @xmath31 pairs related to @xmath32 through lattice symmetry operations .",
    "@xmath33 is the number of such cluster functions per lattice site , and @xmath34 is the total number of lattice sites .    in the structure inversion method one",
    "calculates the @xmath35:s by minimizing @xmath36 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes a list of @xmath38 input structures and @xmath39 their corresponding total energies . the choice of input structures is arbitrary",
    "as long as they contain information about all cluster functions , and an advantage with the sim is that the @xmath5:s can consist of small unit cells in a super - cell approach , for which the total energy , may be efficiently calculated using dft methods .    in order to select cluster functions to be used in the fitting , we used cross - validation,@xcite with the intention to obtain an optimal fit , while at the same time avoid over - fitting .",
    "it is applied to ce by defining a hierarchy of clusters , were a cluster is included only if all its sub - clusters are included , and short range clusters are prioritized over long - range clusters .",
    "then , by choosing clusters in this way , the aim is to minimize the cross - validation score @xmath40 here , @xmath41 denotes the predicted energy of structure @xmath14 , using parameters @xmath8 obtained _ without _ structure @xmath14 included in the fit .",
    "thus , the cv - score measures the ability of the ce , with a given set of cluster functions , to predict the energy of new structures .",
    "we note that all @xmath38 structures are included in the fit in eq .  .",
    "we have used the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp),@xcite a plane - wave pseudo potential implementation of the dft method , in the present electronic structure calculations .",
    "for the exchange - correlation approximation we used the perdew - wang implementation of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the built - in ultra - soft pseudo potentials by vanderbilt _",
    "were used.@xcite @xmath42-points were chosen according to the monkhorst - pack scheme in meshes corresponding to @xmath43 points for the conventional fcc unit cell , or denser .",
    "tests showed that using a mesh corresponding to @xmath44 @xmath42-points changed the energy with typically 1 - 2 mev / atom .",
    "the atomic structure was relaxed at constant volume using a conjugate gradient technique , or in some cases a damped molecular dynamics algorithm .",
    "we found that both methods led to the same relaxed state .",
    "we note that during the relaxation , the symmetry is preserved .",
    "this means that if the relaxation starts at a saddle point in the potential energy landscape , the system may stay at this saddle point due to symmetry restrictions .",
    "in particular , pure si in the fcc structure is unstable with respect to tetragonal shear,@xcite but this relaxation mode is not taken into account in our calculations .",
    "the computational study of the thermodynamic properties of the al - mg - si system requires to take configurational space properly into account . to this end",
    "we use the standard metropolis@xcite monte carlo sampling technique , generating a sequence of configurations being boltzmann - distributed with respect to the system temperature and configurational energy .",
    "we have held the alloy constituent concentrations unchanged during the simulations .",
    "hence , as the trial - changes we simply choose a random pair of atoms to be exchanged with each - other .",
    "one mc step is defined as one such trial - echange per atom .",
    "a technical aspect of our implementation is that the cluster functions are defined in the so called canonical basis rather than the orthogonal basis ( eq : s ) .",
    "that means that the cluster functions are products of integers rather than real numbers , and their evaluation becomes more efficient .    in order to simulate kinetic processes ( e.g. , nucleation ) we have utilized a kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) algorithm .",
    "the important additional constraint added to a kmc algorithm , as compared to the ordinary mc dito , is that the ( trial- ) changes made to the system are selected in a way correspondig to the effect of some physical process occurring .",
    "the physical process being most important during aging or phase transformations in our al - mg - si alloy system , is the mass transport via atomic diffusion .",
    "the atomic diffusion process was modelled by attempted interchange of two randomly choosen nearest neighbor atoms , and accepting the interchange according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "this model is also known as kawasaki - dynamics.@xcite    to provide an estimate of the time - scale of the simulated diffusion process , we use an experimental value of the aluminum self diffusion coefficient@xcite as input . the experimental input which implicitly contain information about diffusion hop - rates and vacancy concentrations ,",
    "will relate the monte carlo steps to physical time as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the physical time scale of giving all the atoms in the system a chance to diffuse , @xmath47 being the al lattice contant , and @xmath48 is the experimentally determined diffusion coefficient .",
    "the factor @xmath49 accounts for the supersaturation of vacancies that is present , e.g. , after a quench .",
    "we used the kmc method to study the early stage of clustering in al - mg - si .",
    "our definition of a cluster is then that each solute atom ( mg or si ) belonging to a given cluster is nearest neighbour to at least one more solute atom in the same cluster .",
    "the phase diagram , and the underlying free - energy differences between various phases determine the driving force , e.g. , for precipitate formation . in order to calculate the phase boundary between disoerdered and a two - phase region",
    ", one must know the free energy of the disordered phase . in the present work",
    ", it was calculated in the following way .",
    "the energy as a function of temperature was determined for a set of compositions in standard mc simulations .",
    "this was done by slowly decreasing the temperature and the system was then kept in the disorderd state .",
    "a corresponding simulation where the temperature is increased from a low temperature shows a clear hysteresis and the point where the two curves meet can be taken as a rough estimate of the phase boundary .",
    "the entropy in the disordered state was determined using thermodynamic integration of the relation @xmath50 the remaining constant of intgration was taken from the expression for the entropy of a ternary system in the ideal solution model @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the respective atomic concentrations .",
    "this expression is which is valid at sufficiently high temperature . in the present work ,",
    "we integrated from @xmath55 .",
    "to choose input structures for the sim , we started with 8 binary structures and 34 ternary structures in refs . and , respectively .",
    "those structures have been shown to be the only distinct structures that can be obtained if one assumes only up to next - nearest neighbor pair interactions .",
    "( in the ternary case , this has not been strictly proven , but it seems plausible . ) taking into account the structures obtained when the occupation of a , b or c atoms in the generic structures are permuted , one ends up with 148 symmetrically distinct structures .",
    "in addition , we used some low - concentration structures , e.g. , an isolated impurity in a 32 lp cell , see appendix a. further , we excluded some structures , e.g. , pure mg , that had a large static ( positive or negative ) internal pressure . in total",
    ", we ended up with 154 structures .",
    "these structures were used as input to the fitting of the cluster interaction parameters in eq .  .",
    "when selecting clusters , we minimized the cross - validation score given by eq .  .",
    "in the procedure we included pairs , triplets and quadruplets in a hierarchical order , see fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] and table [ tb:1 ] for an explanation of the clusters used .",
    "we found that a good fit was obtained if we included pairs up to fourth nearest neighbor , and the triplets t1 , t2 and t4 ( see table  [ tb:1 ] ) .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath56 parameters @xmath8 that were minimized .",
    "the resulting cv - score is @xmath57  7.1  mev / atom .",
    "convergence of the cv - score ( circles ) and the mean - square deviation between predicted and calculated energies of the input structures ( squares ) , as a function of included clusters ; pairs ( p ) , three - point clusters ( t ) , and four - point clusters ( q ) .",

    "therefore , in order to explain the nucleation mechanism of gp - zones and the @xmath4 phase , we suggest the following possibilities .",
    "either , vibrational entropy effects or vacancies stabilize an ordered pre-@xmath4 based structure , which then transforms into the @xmath4 structure , or the structural transition takes place in the disordered phase , in a mg - si rich cluster with the right local configuration .",
    "recent tem observations clearly indicate that the gp - zones are ordered , fcc - based , structures.@xcite thus , the former explanation seems more likely . in either case",
    ", there is a substantial gain in energy connected to the transition to the @xmath4 structure .",
    "finally , we remark that it is likely that quenched - in vacancies play a direct role in the nucleation of the @xmath4 phase . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", vacancies may faciliate a structural transition from the pre-@xmath4 to the @xmath4 phase simply by providing the extra space needed for the ( 0,0,0 ) mg atom to move @xmath120 lattice vector in the @xmath12-direction . including vacancies in the ce description",
    "is formally straight - forward , however , in practice it would increase the complexity in the ce and lead to other technical complications .",
    "we have investigated the formation of gp - zones in the al - mg - si system using a ce of the total energy .",
    "dft pseudo - potential calculations of 154 fcc - based pure , binary and ternary structures were used to parameterize the energy by the sim .",
    "which cluster functions to include was chosen according to the cross - validation criterion , with the intension to avoid over - fitting .",
    "the method successfully reproduces the total energy of 10 structures based on the suggested pre-@xmath4 structure . regarding the formation of gp - zones ,",
    "the ce calculations shows that the mg@xmath0si@xmath0 l@xmath1 structure suggested by matsuda _",
    "is the most energetically stable phase .",
    "this is also confirmed in direct dft calculations .",
    "our results are in fair agreement with the dft calculations presented by ravi and wolverton,@xcite where one should compare with their _ constrained _ gga results for pre-@xmath4 structures . regarding the formation of the pre-@xmath4 and @xmath4 structures , we outline two possible nucleation mechanisms .",
    "either , the vibrational entropy ( @xmath107 ) term , or the presence of vacancies serve to stabilize the structures preceding the @xmath4 phase , which then transforms to the meta - stable @xmath4 phase .",
