    "the desert  i.e. no new physics in colliders between the tev and the gut scales @xcite  is a realistic but disappointing scenario feared in the context of the recent lhc results @xcite .",
    "however , some high - precision experiments at low energy could detect signatures of gut scale and beyond .",
    "for instance , neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) nedm or proton decay @xcite are such signatures . as a consequence , prospecting for new low - energy tests of physics beyond the standard model is of crucial interest .",
    "it offers an alternative and additional route to colliders to probe new physics with experiments at quite low cost .",
    "moreover , many works domainwall , first , origin , e8e8,branevsdw , rsi , rsii , extradbranreview , ekpy , pyro , branedark,6d , review , m4xz2,pheno , npm , npmth , exp , ftl , dgs , twogen , chungfreese describe our visible universe  our visible world  as a domain wall domainwall , branevsdw ( i.e. a 3-brane ) inside a higher dimensional bulk , generally with five @xcite or sometimes six dimensions @xcite .",
    "some models also consider that many braneworlds could coexist within the bulk e8e8,rsi , ekpy , pyro , branedark , review , m4xz2,pheno , npm , npmth , exp , ftl , chungfreese .",
    "the interest for such many - world scenarios traces back to the hoava - witten @xcite approach linking the @xmath5 heterotic superstring theory in ten dimensions to eleven - dimensional supergravity on the orbifold @xmath6 . assuming a six - dimensional compactification on a calabi - yau manifold , this model leads to a @xmath7 universe ( i.e. a five - dimensional bulk with a compactified extra dimension ) in which ordinary and hidden - sector particles live on two different 3-branes ( or braneworlds ) located at each boundaries of the orbifold . along this line of thought , many models emerge such as the randall and sundrum s solution of the hierarchy problem ( randall - sundrum type i scenario , or rsi ) @xcite , or the so call ekpyrotic @xcite and pyrotechnic @xcite universes as alternatives to cosmic inflation or to explain dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "then , the bulk metric can be warped or not @xcite .",
    "these frameworks have been also extended for a non - compact fifth dimension rsi , rsii , extradbranreview , ekpy , pyro , dgs , twogen , chungfreese .",
    "thus , it is a major concern to put experimental constraints on those braneworld scenarios either at a cosmological scale or in particle physics .",
    "the present paper is located at the crossroads of experimental expectations between braneworld scenarios and low - energy physics .",
    "although high - energy phenomena are often considered when dealing with braneworld phenomenology , it was shown in the last decade that matter exchange must occur at low energy between the closest braneworlds in the bulk @xcite .",
    "for instance , neutron swapping is allowed between our visible universe and a parallel one hidden in the bulk @xcite .",
    "such an effect is probed in some experiments involving search for passing - through - walls neutrons in the vicinity of a nuclear reactor @xcite or search for unusual leaks when dealing with ultracold neutron storage @xcite .",
    "the ability for a neutron to leap from our visible world into a hidden braneworld ( or reciprocally ) is given by a swapping probability @xmath8 @xcite which can be experimentally probed directly @xcite .",
    "the study of this phenomenology is made possible by the fact that any universe with two braneworlds  regardless of the underlying model  is equivalent to a fictive noncommutative two - sheeted spacetime @xmath9 when one follows the dynamics of particles at low energies below the gev scale @xcite .",
    "although many braneworlds can coexist within the bulk , in a first approximation , one can consider a two - brane universe consisting of two copies of the standard model , localized in two adjacent 3d branes . while these two branes are mutually invisible to each other at the zeroth - order approximation , matter fields in separate branes mix at the first - order approximation mainly through @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the dirac fermionic fields in each braneworld",
    " denoted @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is the two - brane or interbrane coupling constant and can be related to the swapping probability such that @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , branes in the bulk are described by @xmath15-thick domain walls ( with a brane energy scale @xmath16 ) , which are kink or antikink solitons of scalar fields allowing fermions  or gauge bosons  trapping on the 4d world @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the equivalence between two - brane models and the noncommutative two - sheeted spacetime approach is general and neither relies on the domain walls features or on the bulk properties ( dimensionality , number of compact dimensions , and metric ) @xcite . as a consequence , in the @xmath17 model",
    ", the fundamental parameter @xmath2 is a black box which implicitly contains the bulk properties , the distance @xmath18 between branes in the bulk , but also their thickness @xmath15 and some properties of the states localized on each brane @xcite .    from the derivation of the @xmath17 model of the two - brane universe",
    ", it was shown that @xmath2 can be explicitly computed against brane and bulk parameters @xcite .",
    "but for an illustrative purpose , and for the sake of simplicity , a simple scenario was considered @xcite , with a flat @xmath19 bulk with fermions trapped along two thick domain walls . in this naive scenario - where the mass of the fermions on each brane is only related to kaluza - klein states -",
    "the interbrane coupling is well approximated by @xcite : @xmath20it is worth noting that the brane energy scale could be as high as the planck scale , i.e. well beyond the reach of direct searches at high energy with particle colliders .",
    "nevertheless , depending on the ratio @xmath21 , @xmath2 can still reach values permitting to explore the braneworld through matter swapping at low energy @xcite .",
    "this motivating result is at the origin of the present paper .    to go further",
    ", realistic braneworld models should not only consider brane thickness through a domain wall approach but also warped metrics and/or compact extra dimensions .",
    "models with more than one extra dimension should be also considered . as a consequence ,",
    "it is crucial to derive expressions of @xmath2 for various braneworld scenarios , but also for more realistic situations , here for a neutron which is not a kaluza - klein state .",
    "nevertheless , a full computation of @xmath2 seems basically out of reach for now .",
    "indeed , strictly speaking , a full description of the neutron would need a description of the standard model on the branes solving equations to give birth to the neutron .",
    "then , a phenomenological approach is required to estimate @xmath2 for a neutron against the bulk metric and dimensionality , the brane energy scale , and interbrane distance .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper . in section",
    "ii , we recall more details of the basic framework which motivates the present work . in section iii , we introduce the phenomenological approach which allows us to address the problem of the computation of @xmath2 for the neutron for two thick branes in a 5d bulk . at last , in section iv , considering the brane energy scale ( i.e. its thickness ) , the interbrane distance , and the bulk metric , we cross our results with existing experimental constraints to get bounds on @xmath2 and discuss this in the context of future experiments .",
    "as explained here above , whatever the high - energy theory of a two - brane universe ( i.e. whatever the number or properties of the bulk scalar fields responsible for particle trapping on branes , the number of extra dimensions or the bulk metric , etc . ) , the fermions dynamics on each brane at low energy corresponds to the dynamics of fermions in a @xmath17 spacetime in the context of the noncommutative geometry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in an illustrative purpose ,",
    "let us first consider two braneworlds described by two topological defects in the bulk .",
    "for instance , we can consider two domain walls corresponding to a kink  anti - kink pair of solitons in a @xmath19 flat 5d bulk .",
    "a simple lagrangian for such a system is :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is a @xmath24 bulk gauge field .",
    "@xmath25 is the scalar field .",
    "the potential @xmath26 is assumed to ensure the existence of kink - like solutions , i.e. of domain walls by following the rubakov - shaposhnikov concept @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 is the massless fermionic matter field .",
    "@xmath27 is coupled to the scalar field @xmath28 through a yukawa coupling term @xmath29 with @xmath30 the coupling constant .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath31 reduces to the effective lagrangian @xmath32 for energies below the gev scale .",
    "then , the effective phenomenological discrete two - point space @xmath33 replaces the continuous real extra dimension @xmath34 . at each point along the discrete extra dimension @xmath33 there is then a four - dimensional spacetime @xmath35 with its own metric .",
    "each @xmath35 sheet describes each braneworld then considered as being separated by a phenomenological distance @xmath36 .",
    "this result is obtained from an approach inspired by the construction of molecular orbitals in quantum chemistry , here extended to fermionic bound states on branes .",
    "then , @xmath2 is proportional to an overlap integral of the fermionic wave functions of each @xmath4-brane over the extra dimension @xmath34 m4xz2 .    then , the effective @xmath17 lagrangian for the fermion dynamics in a two - brane universe is @xcite : @xmath37labeling @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath13 ) our brane ( respectively the hidden brane ) , we write : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the wave functions in the branes @xmath41 and : @xmath42@xmath43 are the electromagnetic four - potentials on each brane @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the mass of the bound fermion on a brane .",
    "the off - diagonal mass term @xmath46 results from the two - domain wall universe @xcite .",
    "the derivative operator is then : @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and@xmath49 , and the dirac operator is defined as @xmath50 where : @xmath51  and  @xmath52 . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the usual dirac matrices and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) the pauli matrices .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) is typical of noncommutative @xmath57 two - sheeted spacetimes @xcite .",
    "regarding the electromagnetic field , it was shown @xcite that the five - dimensional @xmath58 bulk gauge field must be substituted by an effective @xmath59 gauge field in the @xmath17 spacetime .",
    "the dvali - gabadadze - shifman mechanism @xcite leading to the gauge field localization on the branes , @xmath60 are the gauge groups of the photon fields on each brane and the bulk gauge field @xmath23 splits into @xmath61 .",
    "the electromagnetic field @xmath62 is then introduced in the dirac equation through @xmath63 .    in this approach",
    ", it must be noted that the mass @xmath45 corresponds to a kaluza - klein state @xcite and @xmath2 is given by eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) .",
    "so , in order to address the behaviour of a particle related to the standard model , we must consider the fundamental state of the kaluza - klein corresponding to a massless state .",
    "such a state must be `` dressed '' to induce the expected standard mass on the brane . indeed , considering the neutron for instance",
    ", its mass mainly arises from the interaction energy between quarks related to the strong force .",
    "the higgs field contributes to the quarks masses .",
    "strictly speaking , the whole standard model should be introduced - in the braneworld model - with the mechanisms needed to confine it on each brane @xcite .",
    "many fermions must be introduced , not only to get quarks and leptons , but also because at least two fermionic fields are required to get both chirality states on the brane when considering the fundamental kaluza - klein state @xcite . finally , the metric field must be also considered .",
    "anyway , this task is daunting , and since there is possibly many ways to induce the standard model on a brane , a more phenomenological approach would probably be more relevant to address the main features of the coupling constant @xmath2 when dealing with neutron and various metric fields and bulk dimensionality .",
    "this is this the mainspring of the following approach .",
    "and a bulk fermion field @xmath64 .",
    "brane thickness is introduced through the brane energy scale @xmath65.,width=5 ]    in our first approach to derive the @xmath17 model of a two - brane universe , only one fermionic field was considered .",
    "this field was trapped along both branes thanks to a scalar field , with no propagation along extra dimensions . instead ,",
    "in the present phenomenological model , we consider a string - inspired approach @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we consider two fermionic fields existing only on the branes ( like the open strings on a brane ) and one bulk fermionic field ( like the closed strings free to propagate in the bulk ) .",
    "the exact mechanisms responsible for the fermion ( and gauge bosons ) trapping on the branes are not under consideration .",
    "one can also introduce the fermion mass on each brane in an _ ad hoc _ manner without the need for knowledge of the mechanisms inducing mass on the brane .",
    "we consider that fermion field on a brane describes a standard model particle or the neutron field . as a strong hypothesis of our phenomenological model , we assume that the bulk fermion field can carry neutron quantum numbers through the bulk . in this approach ,",
    "the fermion fields on each brane are source terms for the fermionic bulk field .    as an illustration",
    ", we consider the following metric for the bulk : @xmath66with @xmath67 here , we do not consider the rsi scenario . indeed , while the rsi - tev brane sustains the standard model @xcite , it is not the case of the rsi - planck brane .",
    "since our approach considers coupling between branes endowed with their own copy of the standard model , rsi and similar scenarios are not concerned .",
    "instead , we consider a metric inspired by the chung - freese scenario @xcite . in the following ,",
    "when we refer to @xmath68 , it denotes the usual 4d spacetime components while @xmath69 is the fifth extra dimension along which the branes are located .",
    "the whole problem is described by the full action @xmath70 which contains the four terms described hereafter .",
    "the bulk fermion field @xmath71 follows the action : @xmath72where the dirac matrices @xmath73 follow the relationship @xmath74 .",
    "by contrast , we define the `` flat '' dirac matrices @xmath75 through : @xmath76 with @xmath77 the minkowski metric with a @xmath78 signature .",
    "the five dimensional dirac matrices in curved spacetime take the form : @xmath79where @xmath80 defines the vielbein according to : @xmath81the spin connection must satisfy the expression : @xmath82 ,   \\label{connexion}\\]]where @xmath83 are the christoffel symbols for the metric field under consideration .    for each brane located on @xmath84 ,",
    "the actions for the fermion fields @xmath85 are : @xmath86where @xmath87 ( respectively @xmath88 ) are the usual 4d spinors ( respectively the induced metric tensors ) on each brane . @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath90  are the spin connection and the dirac matrices taken on the branes .",
    "@xmath45 is the mass of the particle induced on each brane .",
    "@xmath43 are the electromagnetic potentials on each branes , with @xmath91 for the neutron .",
    "the expression of @xmath92 corresponds to infinitely thin branes .",
    "that means one expects that gauge fields and fermions of the standard models are contained in the thickness @xmath15 of the brane , i.e. they do not spread beyond @xmath93 . as a consequence , the brane thickness is assumed to be small compared to the interbrane distance @xmath18 .",
    "since the fermion fields on each brane are source terms for the fermionic bulk field , the coupling between the brane fields and the bulk field occurs naturally as a 4d mass coupling , and we get:@xmath94 in the domain wall approach @xmath95 and @xmath40 are fundamentally the same fields , reason why we use the simple mass mixing implying @xmath45 , as the coupling occurs only on each brane .",
    "now , though the expression of @xmath96 corresponds to infinitely thin branes , @xmath97 introduces the finite thickness @xmath98 of the branes . in the domain wall approach , due to normalization ,",
    "one gets : @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 with @xmath101 the brane energy scale .",
    "the way @xmath65 appears in eq .",
    "( [ lcoupling ] ) allows for the rescaling of the terms depending on @xmath69  while considering them on the branes  to obtain the relevant 4d coupling .",
    "let us now consider the equation of motion for the bulk field from @xmath102 .",
    "the bulk field simply follows the relationship:@xmath103which is the expected @xmath104-dimensional dirac equation supplemented by the source terms induced by the boundary conditions on the branes . due to mass shell constraint on the branes ,",

    "( [ coupling ] ) , self - coupling terms of the form @xmath121 are not considered . indeed , in the present approach ,",
    "although each braneworld possesses a thickness ( described through @xmath65 ) , they are mathematically described as sheets with a null thickness .",
    "this is valid only if we consider effects due to a brane far from this brane , i.e. at a distance larger than the brane thickness .",
    "by contrast , self - coupling terms are extra - dimensional corrections of a brane on itself , i.e. at null distance where the approximation is not valid .",
    "this is why self - coupling terms are rejected .",

    "( [ g ] ) could be the typical mass of the quarks , i.e. @xmath151 mev , instead of the mass of the full neutron .",
    "the resulting coupling constant is shown in fig .",
    "3 . yet , except for the tev scale given here as an illustration , the gut and the planck scales correspond to values of the coupling constant which could be experimentally probed .",
    "in the context of the @xmath17 low - energy description of a two - brane universe , we have computed the explicit expression of the coupling constant @xmath2 between a neutron in our visible braneworld and a hidden neutron in the hidden braneworld .",

    "while colliders tend to reject new physics at tev and beyond , it is shown that even if the brane energy scale corresponds to the gut or planck scale , @xmath2 can reach values motivating new passing - through - walls - neutron experiments made to detect neutron swapping between braneworlds @xcite .",
    "while we focus here on a 5d bulk , our approach could be extended to a 6d bulk and beyond , compact or non compact , warped or not , and for various metrics .",

    "<S> indeed , any universe with two braneworlds at least  related to two topological defects in the bulk  is equivalent to a fictive noncommutative two - sheeted spacetime @xmath1 when one follows the dynamics of particles below the gev - scale . </S>",
    "<S> this enables a new kind of high - precision experiments at low energy where neutron disappearance ( reappearance ) toward ( from ) a hidden brane is tested to constrain the coupling constant @xmath2 between the visible and hidden sectors of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath2 is a phenomenological constant which must depend on the brane energy scale ( i.e. its thickness ) , the interbrane distance , the bulk dimensionality and metric , and the nature of the particle . as a consequence , knowing the behaviour of @xmath2 against these parameters is fundamental to put constraints on specific braneworld scenarios according to experimental data . here , </S>",
    "<S> we report a general phenomenological way to compute @xmath2  for a neutron  for two braneworlds in the bulk endowed with their own copy of the standard model . for a 5d bulk , </S>",
    "<S> we show that forthcoming passing - through - walls - neutron experiments could detect neutron disappearance / reappearance for branes at gut or planck scales , provided the interbrane distance is lower than @xmath4 fm for the later . </S>"
