    "disks around young stars are a natural part of the star formation process and , as the likely site of planet formation , have generated much interest .",
    "a considerable amount has been learned about the structure of circumstellar disks through the study of dust emission and detailed modeling of the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of these stars .",
    "however , if we assume the standard gas - to - dust ratio for the interstellar medium , dust makes up only 1% of the mass of the disk .",
    "thus there is an interest in developing direct tracers of the gas component .",
    "studies of gas in disks have so far focused mainly on gas at either large radii ( @xmath5 au ) , using observations at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite , or small radii , using observations of near - infrared co lines @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared spectral diagnostics may probe disks at intermediate radii ( 1 - 10 au ) @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen diagnostics are promising because they trace the dominant constituent of the disk and so do not rely on conversion factors to determine the mass of the emitting gas .",
    "h@xmath0 has been observed in circumstellar environments at ultraviolet @xcite and near - infrared @xcite wavelengths .",
    "these observations trace hot circumstellar gas , or gas excited by fluorescent processes , and are therefore difficult to translate into gas masses .",
    "the pure rotational mid - infrared h@xmath0 lines are useful probes because the level populations should be in lte at the local gas temperature , and so line ratios allow determination of the excitation temperature and mass of the warm gas",
    ". the line ratios of the three low - j lines accessible from the ground are sensitive to gas at temperatures of 200 - 800 k. other lines in the mid - infrared such as [ neii ] at 12.8 @xmath6 m @xcite , [ si ] at 25.2 @xmath6 m and [ feii ] at 26 @xmath6 m @xcite should be useful probes of gas in disks but their interpretation requires detailed modeling . molecular hydrogen emission does not trace the cold , optically thick regions of disks , and therefore estimates of the amount of warm gas based on h@xmath0 emission represent a lower limit to the total disk mass . in order to see h@xmath0 emission arising from a disk ,",
    "the warm gas must be either physically separated from optically thick dust or at a different temperature .",
    "these conditions can be met in the disk surface layer or in gaps or holes in the disk . in either case ,",
    "gas can be physically separated ( due to dust settling or clearing ) as well as thermally decoupled ( due to lower densities ) from the dust and heated to a higher temperature by x - ray and uv radiation @xcite .    from the ground , three h@xmath0 mid - infrared rotational lines are accessible : s(1 )  ( @xmath7 m ) , s(2 )  ( @xmath8 m ) , and s(4 )  ( @xmath9 m ) . the high spectral resolution achievable with the texas echelon cross echelle spectrograph ( texes ; lacy et al .",
    "2002 ) is crucial for these observations in order to separate the lines from nearby telluric features and to maximize the line contrast against the dust continuum .",
    "observations at high spectral resolution also have the advantage that , when coupled with information about the disk inclination , they allow an estimate for the location of the emitting gas . for emission lines with small equivalent width , ground - based observations with texes can be more sensitive than _ spitzer _ irs observations .",
    "ab aur is one of the brightest and thus one of the most well - studied of the herbig ae stars .",
    "it is located at a distance of 144 pc based on hipparcos measurements @xcite , has a spectral type of a0-a1 @xcite and is surrounded by a disk / envelope structure that extends to at least @xmath10 au @xcite .",
    "observations at 11.7 and 18.7 @xmath6 m by @xcite show that ab aur varies in the mid - infrared .",
    "the mass of the star is 2.4 m@xmath11 with an age of 2 - 4 myr @xcite .",
    "ab aur has a sed which is well - fit by the passive irradiated disk with puffed - up inner rim model of @xcite .",
    "there have been a wide range of inclination estimates for ab aur ( see brittain et al .",
    "2003 for an extended discussion of this issue ) .",
    "recent results by @xcite derive an inclination of @xmath12 deg for the ab aur system by modeling millimeter observations .",
    "we will assume this value for analysis of our data .",
    "several attempts have been made to observe molecular hydrogen emission from the disk of ab aur .",
    "@xcite claimed the detection of h@xmath0 s(0 )  and s(1 )  emission associated with the ab aur system using the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ , but subsequent observations from the ground with improved spatial resolution were unable to confirm the emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite saw some evidence of emission in the s(2 )  line but the data quality was such that a definitive statement could not be made .",
    "they saw no evidence of the s(1 )  line . in this paper , we present definite detections of the s(1 ) , s(2 ) , and s(4 )  lines .",
    "all of the data were acquired using texes in its high - resolution mode on the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) between december 2002 and october 2004 and on gemini north in november 2006 under program i d gn-2006b - q-42 .",
    "table  1 lists details of the observations .",
    "we nodded the source along the slit to remove background sky emission .",
    "we observed flux and telluric standards at each setting .",
    "other calibration files taken include blank sky and an ambient temperature blackbody used to calibrate the wavelength and to flatfield the data .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard texes pipeline @xcite which produces wavelength - calibrated one dimensional spectra .",
    "the texes pipeline data reduction gives a first order flux calibration .",
    "however , because of the different slit illumination of the ambient temperature blackbody and point sources , we observed flux standards to determine a correction factor .",
    "we assumed that the slit illumination was the same for the target as for the flux standard .",
    "guiding and seeing variations can introduce uncertainty into our flux calibration .",
    "figure  [ 3linefit - fig ] shows flux - calibrated spectra for all three settings taken at the gemini north observatory .",
    "overplotted on each spectrum is a gaussian with integrated line flux equal to that derived from the best - fit model assuming the emission arises from an isothermal mass of optically thin h@xmath0 gas .",
    "the three lines were fit simultaneously while varying the temperature and mass of the emitting gas in the model .",
    "for the simultaneous fitting , we adopted the fwhm and centroid of the s(2 )  line for all three lines .",
    "the quoted errors for the temperature and mass are 1-@xmath13 based on the contour plot of the @xmath14 values .",
    "our best - fit model based on gemini data has t  @xmath15 k and m  @xmath16  m@xmath3 . a similar analysis of our irtf data , which consisted of a detection at s(2 )  and upper limits for s(1 )  and s(4 ) , gives t  @xmath17 k and m  @xmath18  m@xmath3 .",
    "though within 2-@xmath13 uncertainties , the lower measured s(2 )  flux observed at gemini than from the irtf combined with the fact that our slit is smaller on the sky at gemini suggests we may be resolving out some of the flux we see at the irtf . to investigate this possibility , we examined spatial plots of our 2-d echellograms but found no clear evidence for the existence of spatially resolved line emission .",
    "table  2 contains a summary of our results .",
    "we fit each line individually with a gaussian to determine centroid , fwhm , and flux values .",
    "the lines are all centered near the systemic velocity of ab aur and have fwhm @xmath1910 km s@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite find a@xmath20 = 0.25 for ab aur , so we assume no extinction at our wavelengths .",
    "we quote equivalent widths in addition to line fluxes due to uncertainty in the determination of the continuum level . in an attempt to test",
    "how sensitive our temperature and mass estimates are to errors in the flux calibration , we fit our data after normalizing to the continuum flux values from iso sws observations of ab aur @xcite .",
    "the resulting temperature and mass do not differ significantly from the values based on our internal flux calibration .",
    "we derive t @xmath21 k and m @xmath22  m@xmath3 when normalizing to the iso continuum values of 13.1 jy at 8 @xmath6 m , 21.0 jy at 12 @xmath6 m , and 30.8 jy at 17 @xmath6 m before fitting .",
    "the upper limits for s(1 )  and s(4 )  from the irtf quoted in table  2 are based on a gaussian fit at the expected position of each line plus a 1-@xmath13 error .",
    "the 1-@xmath13 line flux errors were computed by summing over the number of pixels corresponding to the fwhm of the lines in regions of the spectrum with similar atmospheric transmission .",
    "figure  [ popdia - fig ] shows a population diagram based on our observations .",
    "the points marked are based on the line fluxes derived from gemini observations listed in table  2 , and the error bars are 1-@xmath13 .",
    "the overplotted solid line is not a fit to the population diagram ; rather it is based on the best - fit model temperature and mass .",
    "even though we only have three points , the deviation from a single temperature ( a straight line on this plot ) is significant and may indicate that the emission is coming from a mix of temperatures , as expected for a disk with a radial temperature gradient .",
    "we note that curvature in the population diagram can also occur if the ortho - to - para ( otp ) ratio is different from our assumed value of 3 .",
    "@xcite derived a an otp ratio between 1.5 - 2 for h@xmath0 in a photodissociation region with gas temperatures of 300 - 700 k. however , the sense of the curvature in our population diagram would require an otp ratio greater than 3 to explain the increased s(1 )  flux , which seems unlikely .",
    "we discuss the derived temperature of the gas and its location in the next section .",
    "we have detected all three mid - ir h@xmath0 lines with good signal to noise .",
    "the results are consistent with the previous upper limits and the 2-@xmath13 detection of the s(2 )  line @xcite . our observations of all three lines allow us to put tighter constraints on the temperature and mass of the emitting gas .",
    "the analysis of our data has three components .",
    "first , we determine a characteristic temperature of the emitting gas by fitting a simple model to the three lines .",
    "second , we locate the position in the disk where the emission arises by comparing our observed line profiles to line profiles calculated from a keplerian disk model . finally , in order to comment on the structure of the disk , we compare our results to the predictions of a well - established disk structure model which assumes well - mixed gas and dust at the same temperature and find that , under such assumptions , we do not reproduce our observations .",
    "this argues for the need for additional gas heating mechanisms which may come in the form of x - ray and uv heating .",
    "the importance of uv and x - ray heating in the surface layers of disks has been demonstrated observationally by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the procedure used to derive a temperature of t  @xmath15 k and mass of m  @xmath23  m@xmath3 from a simulaneous fit to the h@xmath0 s(1 ) , s(2 ) , and s(4 )  lines assumes the gas is optically thin and in lte at a single temperature .",
    "if the emission arises in the atmosphere of a disk where radial and vertical temperature gradients exist , the derived temperature should be considered a characteristic or average temperature .",
    "in fact , figure  [ popdia - fig ] shows evidence that the emission arises in gas at a mix of temperatures .",
    "it should be noted that radial temperature gradients in a disk also affect the detectability of various lines .",
    "since we are most sensitive to narrow emission lines , the s(1 )  line , originating in cooler gas farther out in the disk , is easier to detect than emission in the s(4 )  line .",
    "emission arising very close to the star from the inner rim of the disk would be more difficult for us to detect at our high spectral resolution due to line broadening .",
    "our derived temperature , 670 k , is in agreement with the temperature found by @xcite who derived t @xmath24 k based on s(2 )  and the upper limit on s(1 ) .",
    "@xcite made observations toward ab aur at 4.7 @xmath6 m of @xmath25co v = 1 - 0 emission .",
    "the low - j lines in the resulting population diagram have a steeper slope , interpreted as emission coming from cooler gas than the high - j lines .",
    "fits to the population diagrams assuming lte gas give t @xmath26 k for the cool gas and t @xmath27 k for the hot gas .",
    "the authors explain the hot co emission as coming from the inner rim of the disk , while the cool emission originates in the outer flared part of the disk after it emerges from the inner rim s shadow .",
    "@xcite also observed 4.7 @xmath6 m co emission from ab aur .",
    "isothermal fits with t @xmath28 k are able to reproduce their line fluxes .",
    "the line widths for the co lines are generally broader than what we observed , suggesting that the co emission comes from smaller radii or outflowing gas @xcite .",
    "our derived mass , 0.52  m@xmath3 , is four orders of magnitude less than the total disk mass of ab aur @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that ab aur s disk is optically thick at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "most of the gas in the disk is hidden by optically thick dust and is also too cool to emit at our wavelengths .",
    "the mass we derive should therefore be interpreted as a lower limit to the amount of warm gas on the surface of the disk facing us .    by comparing the fwhm of our observed s(2 )  line profile with computed line profiles from a simple keplerian disk model ,",
    "we derive an estimate of where the line emission originates .",
    "we generate line profiles under the assumption of emission from a keplerian disk inclined at @xmath29 @xcite orbiting a 2.4 m@xmath11 star @xcite with equal emissivity at all points within an annulus 2 au in extent .",
    "we convolve the line profiles with our instrumental broadening function plus a thermal broadening function based on our derived temperature , t = 670 k , and compare the resulting fwhm of the line profiles to our observed s(2 )  line . under these assumptions ,",
    "the line profiles imply that our emission arises near 18 au in the disk .",
    "we used parameters for the disk based on the fit to ab aurigae s sed from @xcite as input to the vertical disk structure model of @xcite in order to derive a grid of temperature and density values as a function of disk radius and height above the midplane .",
    "the @xcite model does an excellent job fitting the sed , although we note that their derived inclination angle , @xmath30 , is significantly larger than our assumed value of @xmath29 . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "the large discrepancy between their derived inclination and what most observations suggest is probably due to the inclusion in their sed model of a perfectly vertical inner rim which may not be physically accurate .",
    "we input this radial and vertical temperature and density profile into an lte radiative transfer program .",
    "we assume the gas is in lte with the dust and compute the emergent spectrum .",
    "the emission lines produced by our model under these conditions are much weaker than our observations .",
    "this is not especially surprising given our assumption of well - mixed gas and dust at the same temperature and suggests the need for additional gas heating mechanisms .",
    "the vertical structure model of @xcite is mainly concerned with modeling the dust emission from disks . by assuming equal gas and dust temperature",
    ", the gas only reaches a temperature of @xmath19 260 k at the top of the disk at 18 au , much cooler than our derived temperature of 670 k. to explain the observed emission , an additional mechanism is needed to heat the gas .",
    "x - ray and uv heating are likely possibilities which can heat the gas to temperatures significantly hotter than the dust .",
    "@xcite computed the gas temperature in x - ray irradiated disks around t tauri stars . at 20 au , the temperature can reach over 3000 k at the top of the disk before dropping to 500 - 2000 k in a transition zone and then to much cooler temperatures deep in the disk .",
    "@xcite considered uv heating of protoplanetary disks and the resulting molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "the temperature in their model at 10 au reaches over 1000 k and predicts an h@xmath0 s(2 )  line flux of @xmath31 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath32 , somewhat lower than our observed flux , but their model was for a less massive star and disk .",
    "h@xmath0 emission could also arise in regions where there is spatial separation of the gas from the dust due to dust settling or coagulation of dust into larger particles .",
    "the sed of ab aur shows no evidence for gaps in the ab aur disk and we are unable to make definitive statements based on our observations .",
    "a uv - heated h@xmath0 layer in a protostellar disk ought to exhibit at least some similarities to the comparable hot layer at the surface of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) with high densities and strong radiation fields .",
    "we therefore compare our observations of ab aur with earlier mid - ir h@xmath0 spectroscopy of the orion bar pdr .",
    "the uv field expressed in terms of the mean interstellar radiation field that was adopted by @xcite ( @xmath33 ) is somewhat smaller than that expected at 18 au around an a0 star ( @xmath34 ) . @xcite",
    "have computed the strength of the uv field throughout a disk around a herbig ae star finding values between @xmath35 - @xmath36 near the disk surface at 20 au .",
    "our derived temperature , 670 k , is in the range of temperatures ( 400 - 700 k ) derived for the orion bar pdr based on the h@xmath0 s(1 ) , s(2 ) , and s(4 )  lines @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the line ratios are determined by a complex mix of the temperature gradient , h@xmath0 abundance and dust properties . as another check of the plausibility that the surface of ab aur s disk is similar to a pdr , we computed the surface brightnesses of our three lines . assuming our observed emission arises from an annulus 2 au in extent centered at 18 au",
    ", we derive surface brightnesses of @xmath37 ergs @xmath32 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 , roughly an order of magnitude lower than those seen by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite estimated that their line intensities were brightened by a factor of 10 since the orion bar pdr is seen nearly edge - on making our surface brightnesses consistent with each other .",
