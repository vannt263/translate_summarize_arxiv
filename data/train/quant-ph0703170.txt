    "surely there must be a sort of bottleneck that impedes the unification of both the quantum and the gravitation theories . in the mainstream opinion ,",
    "the bottleneck is the concept of gravity rather than the concept of quantum , possibly we have to reformulate our concept of spacetime and introduce sophisticated representations of the geometry . in a sidestream opinion ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) , the bottleneck is within the concept of quantum theory , maybe in the notorious concept of wave function collapse which blocks our progress to a unified quantum gravity .",
    "if we support this sidestream opinion , it deserves a look at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] of the physics building @xcite .",
    "it might well be that the path upto a relativistic theory of a quantized universe goes through the non - relativistic theory of newtonian quantum gravity explaining    @xmath2velocity of light , @xmath3newton s gravitational constant , @xmath4planck constant .",
    "the corners of the triangle represent the three fundamental theories , the sides correspond to partially unified theories while the middle symbolizes the fully unified theory . ]    the quantized motion of common macroscopic objects .",
    "if the conflict of wave function collapse with the concept of gravity is indeed the bottleneck then , in the newtonian limit , the resolution should come in the form of a gravity - related ( but non - hamiltonian ) theory of spontaneous ( i.e. non - environmental ) _ decoherence and collapse _ of macro - objects wave function .",
    "this task is complex and maybe too elusive .",
    "it is , therefore , in tradition that we focus on the quantized motion of a rigid massive ball prepared in a so - called schrdinger cat state and we suppose a certain newton - gravity - related decoherence for it .",
    "we are going to adopt this focused discussion of the quantized motion of massive objects , which might eventually clear a path to the relativistic unification of the quantum and gravity .",
    "our macroscopic system is a rigid homogenous ball .",
    "initially we start from a schrdinger cat state .",
    "it means that the c.o.m .",
    "wave function of the ball is a balanced superposition of two distant wave packets .",
    "we postulate a quick universal ( non - environmental ) decoherence - collapse mechanism which destroys the superposition in a short time @xmath6 ( decoherence ) , also drops one of the wave packets and retains the other at random ( collapse ) . this way the initial macroscopic ( i.e. : large - distance ) superposition    the schrdinger cat state ( upper part ) decoheres and collapses to one of the two wave packets ( middle part ) and a localized pointer state is formed ultimately ( lower part ) .",
    "]    has disappeared .",
    "the local superpositions ( i.e. : internal to one wave packet ) survive and , according to a further assumption , become uniform later when the wave packet takes a steady shape .",
    "we call this ultimate state _ pointer state_. this qualitative picture of the process two - packets  one - packet  one - pointer - state , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , if it were real , would relax the controversy between quantum mechanics and macroscopic physics .",
    "anyway , it deserves the concrete study : are there simple equations at all , to model the postulated scenario ?    due to the extreme simplification of the system , we can use transparent equations .",
    "all equations will contain the same newtonian structure .",
    "formally , this structure is just the newtonian self - interaction potential of two hypothetical interpenetrating copies of our rigid ball centered at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively : @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the newton constant , @xmath10 is the mass density at @xmath11 of the homogeneous rigid ball of mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 , @xmath14 stands for the step function .",
    "this potential takes the standard elementary form for large separations and it becomes a quadratic potential for small separations @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the frequency of the corresponding hypothetic oscillator .",
    "this @xmath5 will be utilized in various equations below , namely , in the equation of the c.o.m .",
    "decoherence , in the equation of the pointer states , and in the equation of both .",
    "before we suggest any differential equation for the process of decoherence , we restrict ourselves to the equation of the decoherence time @xmath17 which is needed to collapse the macroscopic superposition , cf . the step from the upper stage to the middle one on fig .  2 .",
    "the suggested general expression reads @xcite : @xmath18 for distant superposition , like the schrdinger cat state on fig .  2",
    ", we get : @xmath19 for atomic masses , @xmath17 is extremely long and the corresponding decoherence effect is irrelevant . for nano - objects ,",
    "@xmath17 is shorter and the postulated universal decoherence may compete with the inevitable environmental decoherence",
    ". this would be the regime of experimental interest . for large macro - objects , @xmath17 is unrealistically short , i.e. , they would never form a schrdinger cat state  which is just the consequence we desire .    hence ,",
    "( [ t_g ] ) yields a plausible scale of spontaneous decoherence .",
    "there is a serious problem , however . for a point - like massive ball",
    "@xmath20 as well as for any object containing point - like massive constituents @xmath21 is @xmath22 therefore @xmath17 would be zero !",
    "this can not be physical , we can not suppose infinite fast decoherence in any case .",
    "therefore , the eq .",
    "( [ t_g ] ) can not be universally valid unless , e.g. , we introduce a cutoff to resolve the issue that the decoherence speed @xmath23 diverges for point - like objects .",
    "let us anticipate that the simple form ( [ t_g ] ) of the decoherence - collapse time induces a natural form for the differential equation of the detailed stochastic process .",

    "the approximation @xmath27 is valid if @xmath28 cm and @xmath29 g .",
    "then @xmath30 and the sne reduces to : @xmath31 if there is no external potential , the exact ground state solution is easy because in the special framework @xmath32 the equation describes a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath12 and frequency @xmath33 .",
    "we can just read out the ground state wave function of the oscillator from a textbook : @xmath34    the sne ( [ sne ] ) is a non - linear and reversible .",
    "contrary to the decoherence - collapse speed @xmath23 , the sne remains regular for @xmath35 , i.e. , for point - like objects or constituents as well .",

    "a further technical difference consists of the trivial new term with @xmath38 , that assures the normalization of the state .",
    "we expect that the ground state solution is a standing soliton of width @xmath26 of the same order like for the sne , and galilean translations - boosts yield the overcomplete set of pointer states .    for atomic particles , similarly to the sne ,",
    "@xmath26 is extremely large and can not represent any significant localization . for nano - objects",
    "the localization becomes significant . for a rigid ball of common density",
    "the approximation @xmath27 applies if @xmath28 cm and @xmath29 g .",
    "then @xmath30 and the frsne reduces to : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "if there is no external potential , the exact ground state solution is simple : @xmath41 as we see , the ground state is identical with the ground state ( [ snesol ] ) of the sne provided we replace @xmath0 by @xmath1 .",
    "the non - linear frsne ( [ sne ] ) is , contrary to the sne , not reversible .",
    "the frsne keeps to be regular for @xmath35 . when we generated the pointer states by the sne in sec .",
    "[ sec_sne ] it was not clear `` how the wave function would reduce to these pointer states and whether the sne has any role in the _ process _ of reduction '' .",
    "the frsne is on the positive side now : its role in the process of reduction is clear .",
    "at least there is a natural choice for the stochastic dynamics , see sec .",
    "[ sec_match ] .",
    "as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_decoh ] , there is a straightforward mathematical model @xcite of the decoherence - collapse process that emerges directly from the decoherence - collapse speed @xmath23 defined by ( [ t_g ] ) .",
    "the central structure of the model is the standard von neumann equation of motion for the c.o.m .",

    "this von neumann  newton equation ( vnne ) , see originally in @xcite , describes decoherence but it does not yet describe collapse and the subsequent reduction to a pointer state either . nonetheless , there is a natural stochastic modification ( also called unraveling ) of the vnne which can do it : @xmath45\\rho({{\\bf x}},{{\\bf x}}')\\\\                            & + & \\frac{1}{\\hbar}[w_t({{\\bf x}})+w_t({{\\bf x}}')-2\\langle w_t\\rangle]\\rho({{\\bf x}},{{\\bf x}}')~,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 itself is a white - noise field with spatial correlation : @xmath48=-\\hbar u({{\\bf x}}-{{\\bf x}}')\\delta(t - t')$ ] .    after long time",
    ", this stochastic differential equation drives any initial state @xmath42 into a localized pure state  the pointer state  while the stochastic differential equation reduces to the following stochastic wave equation : @xmath49\\psi({{\\bf x}})\\nonumber\\\\                            & + & \\frac{1}{\\hbar}[w_t({{\\bf x}})-\\langle w_t\\rangle]\\psi({{\\bf x}})~.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can recognize the frsne plus a stochastic term ! ( the change @xmath50/2 $ ] of the trivial renormalizing term compensates the contribution of the singular stochastic term . )",
    "we are not able to solve this equation in the general case",
    ". we can do it in the limit where the c.o.m .",
    "is already well localized with respect to the size @xmath13 of the ball . in this limit",
    "the equation reads : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is standard white - noise of correlation @xmath53=\\delta(t - t')$ ] .",
    "if there is no external potential , the exact steady shape solutions of this equation are the pointer state solutions of the frsne and the effect of the stochastic term only contributes to the random walk of the steady wave packet .",
    "my work advocates the frictional alternative of the sne instead of the sne itself .",
    "the latter has been studied in a number of works including physics and mathematical ones @xcite .",
    "the frictional alternative attracted less attention although the special case ( [ frsnequad ] ) with the quadratic imaginary potential had been studied @xcite and was already utilized to generate pointer states longtime ago @xcite .",
    "that time , however , it was not quite clear to me why just frictional equations were better pointer state generators than others , and only after many years could kiefer and i analyze the complexity of the issue @xcite .",
    "future investigation of the mathematical properties of the frsne is of interest .",
    "finally , i would like to comment on the historic context .",
    "penrose and myself got the same form ( [ t_g ] ) of the decoherence - collapse time @xmath17 .",
    "( former discrepancies have been clarified in @xcite . )",
    "i derived this equation from the vnne ( [ vnne ] ) and for quite a long time i did not see why penrose did never buy the straightforward construction of the vnne from @xmath17 .",
    "later i understood his reservation .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_decoh ] , too , the form ( [ t_g ] ) yields a divergent @xmath23 for @xmath54 and this divergence is inherited by the vnne .",
    "this is indeed a serious problem and we do not exactly know what to do with it , see @xcite and references therein . for point - like particles the decoherence speed @xmath23 would become infinite and the width of the wave function would tend to zero .",
    "but we do not expect the process of reduction to end up with singular wave functions rather we expect it ends up with localized `` pointer states '' of a certain finite width .",
    "penrose defines the set of pointer states , independently of the equation ( [ t_g ] ) of @xmath17 , as the ground state solitons of the sne .",
    "so we have decent pointer states even for point - like structures and",
    "we may get some hint how to cure the divergence of @xmath23 .",
    "i suggest warily : the hint might come from the stochastic wave equation ( [ stwe ] ) which unifies the complete scenario of fig .  2 in one equation .",
    "section [ sec_match ] invokes ref .",
    "@xcite to claim the stochastic wave equation follows naturally from the eq .",
    "( [ t_g ] ) of @xmath17 .",
    "the deterministic part of ( [ stwe ] ) is regular for @xmath35 , only its stochastic part is divergent .",
    "shall gravity make a loophole somehow ?",
    "we do nt yet know .",
    "it is , nonetheless , remarkable that the deterministic part is the frictional schrdinger ",
    "newton equation .",
    "the frsne has thus been in business already , and also independent arguments @xcite favor this class of _ irreversible _ modifications of the schrdinger equation to generate robust pointer states , see also @xcite .",
