    "recently , the belle collaboration performed precise measurements of the @xmath0 reaction cross section for pion - pair invariant masses @xmath1 ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 gev @xcite . owing to the huge statistics and good energy resolution ,",
    "a clear signal from the @xmath3 resonance was first discovered with the belle detector .",
    "evidences for the @xmath3 production in @xmath5 collisions obtained in a series of previous measurements @xcite were essentially less conclusive .",
    "the @xmath3 signal observed in the belle experiment turned out to be rather small .",
    "this feature is in good qualitative agreement with the prediction of the four - quark model @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the preliminary belle data @xcite in the @xmath3 region was performed in ref .",
    "in particular , it was found @xcite that the magnitude and shape of the @xmath3 peak observed in the @xmath0 reaction cross section excellently agree with the @xmath9 loop mechanism of the @xmath3 production , @xmath15 .",
    "this result is one of many in favor of the four - quark nature of the @xmath3 state @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we clarify the current situation around the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 resonances in the reactions @xmath10 by analyzing the final belle data @xcite on the @xmath0 cross section in the region @xmath16 gev , together with the crystal ball data @xcite on the reaction @xmath12 for @xmath17 gev . as the first step , in sec .",
    "ii , the pure born cross sections and those involving the @xmath18 wave born contributions modified by strong final - state interactions are compared with the available data on the reactions @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such a comparison is very useful because it enables us to gain some idea of the scope and shape of other possible contributions to the cross sections .",
    "the scheme taking into account the @xmath18 wave final - state interactions between pions and kaons , in which the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances take part , is presented in sec .",
    "iii . in this scheme",
    "we essentially use the results of the simultaneous analysis of the data on the @xmath19 decay , @xmath11 scattering , and reaction @xmath20 @xcite , as well as the results of the previous analyses of the @xmath10 reaction mechanisms @xcite . in secs .",
    "iv and v , tentative values of the direct coupling constants of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances to @xmath5 are determined from the belle and crystal ball data .",
    "it is important that these constants turn out to be small , and consequently , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays are , in fact , the four - quark transitions caused by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 loop mechanisms , respectively .",
    "the chiral shielding of the @xmath2 resonance takes place in the reactions @xmath10 @xcite as well as in @xmath11 scattering @xcite .",
    "in addition , in sec .",
    "v , we make some comments on the difficulties of interpreting the experimental measurements for @xmath12 production in the @xmath4 resonance region . here",
    "we also point to a possible way out and announce some preliminary results of a simultaneous description of the @xmath0 data and the latest , very high statistics belle data on the @xmath12 reaction cross section .",
    "the estimates for the @xmath13 decay width are also given .",
    "conclusions are shortly formulated in sec .",
    "the mark ii @xcite , cello @xcite , and belle @xcite data on the cross section for the reaction @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "all the data correspond to a limited angular range of the registration of the charged pions , such that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the polar angle of the produced @xmath23 meson in the center - of - mass system of two initial photons .",
    "the belle data are represented with statistical errors only , the relative values of which are approximately equal to 0.5%1.5% .",
    "the @xmath1 bin size in the belle experiment has been chosen to be 5 mev , with the mass resolution of about 2 mev .",
    "figure 1(a ) also represents the comparison between the data and theoretical curves corresponding to the pure born cross sections for the process @xmath0 for @xmath24 : the total integrated cross section @xmath25 and the integrated cross sections @xmath26 , where @xmath27 or 2 is the absolute value of the photon helicity difference . according the low theorem ,",
    "the born contributions give the exact physical amplitude of the crossing reaction @xmath28 near its threshold .",
    "if strong interactions of pions near the @xmath11 threshold are not too large ( this is the case owing to chiral symmetry ) , then the born contributions have to dominate near the threshold of the reaction @xmath0 as well . as is seen from fig .",
    "1(a ) , this expectation does not contradict the data existing in the threshold region , though their errors are very large as yet .",
    "moreover , the born amplitudes can be used as a quite reasonable approximation of the primary background ( nonresonance ) contributions in the reaction @xmath0 up to the @xmath4 resonance region , as well as a reasonable foundation for constructing the amplitudes involving the strong final - state interactions ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the pure born contributions have the following features .",
    "first , @xmath25 reaches its maximum at @xmath29 gev , in the vicinity of which @xmath30 .",
    "however , @xmath31 involving the @xmath18 wave contribution decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath1 so that @xmath25 is fully dominated by the contribution from @xmath32 for @xmath33 gev ; see fig .",
    "second , though @xmath32 is determined essentially by the @xmath34 wave contribution with @xmath35 , the differential cross section @xmath36 in the region @xmath24 changes very weakly ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , and it becomes more and more flat in this region of @xmath37 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "therefore , in analyzing the data corresponding to this angular range , one should be very careful to make a definite conclusion about the partial wave structure of the smooth background .",
    "in other words , the above example hints that the assumption of the @xmath18 wave dominance @xcite may be completely unjustified in reality .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows only the belle data in the region @xmath38 to illustrate clearly the discovered signal from the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the visible height of the @xmath3 peak is of about 15 nb over the overall smooth background of the order of 100 nb , and its visible ( effective ) width is of about @xmath39 mev .",
    "it is natural to consider that the large background under the @xmath3 resonance is mainly caused by the contributions from the born amplitude with @xmath35 and the @xmath4 resonance production amplitude also with @xmath35 .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows the theoretical curves for the total integrated cross section @xmath40 and the integrated ones @xmath41 and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the @xmath0 cross section with @xmath27 in which the contributions of the @xmath18 wave born amplitude are modified by the strong final - state interactions .",
    "all the higher partial waves , @xmath34 , @xmath42 , etc .",
    ", in @xmath41 are taken in the born approximation @xcite .",
    "the above modification leads to a signal from the @xmath3 resonance in @xmath41 whose magnitude and shape are in surprising agreement with the belle data ; see fig .",
    "an explicit form for @xmath41 will be given below .",
    "the comparison of the curves in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(a ) shows that the @xmath18 wave contribution to @xmath43 is small for @xmath33 in any case .",
    "certainly , the @xmath4 resonance contribution is an important component needed for the description of the belle data in the whole region of @xmath1 from 0.8 to 1.5 gev .    , and from crystal ball @xcite on the cross section for @xmath12 .",
    "the theoretical curves correspond to the pure born cross sections , as well as the born cross sections modified for strong final - state interactions in the @xmath18 wave .",
    "see the text for details . ]",
    "the incorporation of final - state interactions in the @xmath18 wave born amplitude @xmath0 leads to a striking prediction for the @xmath18 wave amplitude @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "figure 1(d ) demonstrates the comparison of the @xmath18 wave partial cross section for the reaction @xmath44 , @xmath45 , calculated in the way outlined above , with the crystal ball data @xcite . since @xmath45 does not contain any fitting parameter , the agreement with experiment in the region @xmath46 gev is quite reasonable .",
    "note that , in the crystal ball experiments @xcite , the @xmath12 cross section was scanned with a 50-mev - wide step , and therefore the narrow @xmath3 structure could not be resolved .",
    "it is also clear that in the reaction @xmath12 , as well as in @xmath0 , the @xmath4 resonance manifestation domain begins for @xmath47 gev .",

    "@xcite , the majority of current investigations of the mass spectra in scalar channels do not study particle production mechanisms .",

    ", the very first estimate of the @xmath78 coupling to the photons via a two - pion intermediate state @xcite was restricted to the case of the `` bare '' ( without any background ) @xmath78 meson , which contradicts the low energy chiral dynamics , and the recent estimates of the @xmath7 decay width @xcite have not taken into account the rapidly changing @xmath9 loop production mechanism of the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the progress in understanding the particle production mechanisms could essentially help us reveal the light scalar meson nature .",
    "to estimate the @xmath13 decay width , @xmath174 , from the data on @xmath10 , it is usually assumed that the @xmath4 decay occurs mostly into @xmath5 states with @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "different assumptions about the background amplitudes in the @xmath4 region have been used in the literature @xcite . in so doing ,",

    "the authors of the belle experiment presented `` a consistency check '' of their data in the @xmath4 region with this estimate .",

    "iv ) . let us stress , however , that the very fact of the suppression of the direct @xmath2 and @xmath3 couplings to photons ( corresponding widths are much less than 1 kev ) can be considered to be well established .",
    "in addition , it appears from the new belle data that @xmath223 is about a factor of 1.5 higher than the estimate quoted by the pdg @xcite .",

    "we verified that the parametrization of the @xmath4 contribution used by the belle collaboration @xcite leads to a similar resonance pattern . to improve the description of the available data on the reaction @xmath12 , it is necessary to raise the left wing of the @xmath4 resonance and to lower its right one @xcite , i.e. , to change the @xmath4 resonance shape in comparison with that established from the @xmath0 data .",

    "<S> new high statistics belle data on the @xmath0 reaction cross section measured in the range of pion - pair invariant masses @xmath1 between 0.8 gev and 1.5 gev are analyzed to clarify the current situation around the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 resonances in @xmath5 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis shows that the direct coupling constants of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances to @xmath5 are small , and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays are four - quark transitions caused by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 loop mechanisms , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral shielding of the @xmath2 resonance takes place in the reactions @xmath10 as well as in @xmath11 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> some results of a simultaneous description of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 belle data are also presented . in particular , the following tentative estimate of the @xmath13 decay width is obtained : @xmath14 kev . </S>"
