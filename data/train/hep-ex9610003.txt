    "fermilab experiment 789 is a study of two - prong decays of beauty and charm which took data during the 1990/1 fixed - target run .",
    "e789 has published the most precise measurement of the charm production cross section and its @xmath4 dependence in 800gev proton collisions,@xcite as well as novel measurements at very forward @xmath5 of the @xmath2 production cross section and its @xmath4 dependence using our beam dump ( or a beryllium insert just upstream of the beam dump ) as the target.@xcite more recent results include the only measurement to date of the cross section for beauty production in proton collisions at fixed - target energy,@xcite observed via the process @xmath6 , and high - statistics studies of @xmath2 and @xmath3 production.@xcite",
    "the e789 apparatus ( shown schematically in fig .  [ fig : e789 ] ) has been described in detail elsewhere@xcite ; we summarize briefly here .",
    "it is based on the pre - existing e605/772 spectrometer,@xcite upgraded for this run by the addition of two silicon - microstrip vertex telescopes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssd789 ] ) , one above and one below the beam , replacement of the station-1 mwpcs with drift chambers , and a tenfold increase in data - recording capacity ( to 50mb / spill ) .",
    "wire - like targets were used to localize the primary - interaction vertex in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , so that only the decay vertex need be reconstructed .",
    "= 2.87 in    = 2.54 in    the spectrometer features two large analysis magnets , sm12 and sm3 , which deflect charged particles in opposite directions in @xmath7 .",
    "a water - cooled copper beam dump suspended within sm12 absorbs non - interacting beam protons as well as secondaries emitted within @xmath9@xmath10mr of the beam in @xmath7 . shielding within and around sm12 absorbs neutral secondaries .",
    "this geometry limits the pair acceptance to @xmath91% but allows operation at high interaction rates .",
    "the vertex telescopes and the 23 planes of scintillation - counter hodoscopes and drift chambers at stations 1 , 2 , and 3 measure the tracks of charged particles passing above or below the beam dump . the sm3 magnet serves to remeasure charged - particle momenta and thus to confirm the target origin of tracks , allowing the copious background of muons created within the beam dump to be rejected .",
    "particles are identified by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , scintillation - hodoscope and proportional - tube muon detectors , and a ring - imaging cherenkov counter . in most events",
    "only two oppositely - charged particle tracks traversing the spectrometer are fully reconstructed , one passing through each vertex telescope .",
    "data were taken separately in charm and beauty spectrometer settings . in the charm running we were able to operate the spectrometer at interaction rates up to 5mhz , using an on - line vertex trigger processor@xcite to reject @xmath1180% of hadron pairs from the target .",
    "the higher sm12 current used in the beauty setting allowed @xmath2 and @xmath3 data to be taken at a 50mhz interaction rate , with no on - line vertex cut needed .",
    "we have measured differential cross sections for charm@xcite and charmonium@xcite production .",
    "charm data were taken using gold and beryllium targets at sm12 currents of 900 and 1000 amperes .",
    "[ fig : d - peak ] shows the observed hadron - pair mass distributions ( under the @xmath12 and @xmath13 assumptions mass region and was not used in this analysis . ]  ) for the various e789 charm data samples , using two different decay - vertex cuts .",
    "clear @xmath14 signals stand out above the dihadron background .",
    "the looser vertex cuts ( @xmath15 ) were found to optimize the statistical significance of the signal and were used in the cross - section and @xmath4-dependence analyses .",
    "= 2.4 in = 2.65 in    our narrow range of acceptance in the longitudinal momentum of the pair ( due to the beam - dump and shielding geometry ) precludes a direct measurement of total cross section .",
    "we measure@xcite the @xmath16 differential cross section @xmath17b / nucleon at @xmath18 .",
    "this can be extrapolated over all @xmath5 ( using the @xmath5 shape measured by previous experiments@xcite ) to give a total @xmath16 cross section @xmath19b / nucleon.@xcite averaging with previous measurements using 800gev proton beams@xcite gives @xmath20b / nucleon , consistent with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd predictions@xcite within the broad range of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "[ fig : mumu - mass ] also shows the dimuon mass distribution from the beauty running , and figs .",
    "[ fig : psi - pt ] and [ fig : psip - pt ] compare our measured @xmath2 and @xmath3 differential cross sections with qcd predictions.@xcite here there is little uncertainty in the extrapolation over @xmath5 , with the @xmath5 shape well determined both by these  open - aperture \" data alone and in combination with our beam - dump data,@xcite as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi - xf ] . as at the tevatron",
    "collider,@xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 production are substantially underestimated in the qcd calculation , with phenomenological  @xmath21 factors \" of 7 and 25 ( respectively ) required to give agreement in magnitude between data and theory . note that the model calculation includes only contributions from color - singlet charmonium states and neglects possible contributions from color - octet charmonium components@xcite and from postulated states above @xmath22 threshold.@xcite ( these discrepancies have been the subject of much attention and are discussed further in sec .  5 .",

    "nuclear dependences of production cross sections can shed light on production mechanisms and thus are of intrinsic interest .",
    "in addition , suppression of charmonium production in nucleus - nucleus collisions has been proposed as a signature for quark - gluon - plasma formation,@xcite so it is important to study processes responsible for charmonium suppression in proton - nucleus collisions , which might present a background to a quark - gluon - plasma signal .",
    "the production of heavy quarks is naively expected to depend linearly on the atomic weight ( @xmath4 ) of the target nucleus , since the dominant qcd mechanisms ( gluon - gluon fusion and @xmath26 annihilation ) involve hard partons.@xcite however , in fermilab e772 we showed@xcite that charmonium production in proton - nucleus collisions in fact has a complicated dependence on @xmath4 , parametrized as @xmath27 , suggesting that other processes are at work in addition to those of perturbative qcd .    the concentration of our charm sample in a narrow range of feynman-@xmath28 results in the most precise determination to date of the charm - production nuclear dependence at a point in @xmath5 , allowing a precise comparison to be made between open - charm and charmonium production . to augment the forward-@xmath5 @xmath4-dependence measurements of e772",
    ", we took additional @xmath2 data in e789 , using a rotating wheel of beryllium , carbon , and tungsten targets placed 1.27 m downstream of the usual target position in order increase the acceptance near @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig : negjpsi ] shows the dimuon mass distributions thus obtained and the resulting @xmath4-dependence exponent @xmath30 _ vs.  _",
    "@xmath5 for @xmath2 compared with that for @xmath31 .",
    "we see that ( at least at small @xmath5 ) @xmath30 is significantly lower for charmonium than for charm : @xmath31 production depends linearly on @xmath4 ( @xmath32 at @xmath33),@xcite while for the @xmath2 , @xmath34.@xcite    = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    the increased nuclear suppression at low @xmath5 of charmonium as compared to charm is consistent with models in which charmonium production is suppressed in nuclei due to dissociation by interaction with co - moving partons.@xcite models in which the nuclear suppression of charmonium production is an initial - state effect ( _ e.g .  _ due to possible shadowing or nuclear modification of the gluon structure function ) are disfavored , since they would predict similar nuclear dependences for @xmath2 and @xmath35 production .",
    "effects on charmonium production at large @xmath5 due to intrinsic charm@xcite ( the presence of virtual @xmath36 pairs in the nucleon sea ) and initial - state parton energy loss@xcite have also been postulated .",
    "the predictions of the intrinsic - charm model have not been borne out by our data since they feature significantly larger ( and more strongly @xmath4-dependent ) cross - section contributions at the largest @xmath5 than are seen.@xcite the qualitative trend we observe at large @xmath5 ( nuclear suppression increasing with @xmath5 ) is successfully accomodated in models which take account of parton energy loss@xcite in traversing nuclear matter . since gluons should interact more strongly with matter than quarks , the parton energy - loss model makes the intriguing prediction that at the highest feynman-@xmath28 ( where @xmath37 annihilation dominates over gluon - gluon fusion ) , the nuclear suppression should decrease.@xcite the apparent increase of @xmath30 at @xmath38 suggests that this may be occurring , but better statistics are needed for confirmation ; these should be forthcoming from fermilab e866 , which is to take data during the 1996/7 fixed - target run .",
    "production of charm@xcite and beauty@xcite quarks is in reasonable agreement with perturbative qcd calculations . on the other hand , production of charm and beauty _ quarkonia _",
    "are observed at rates from one to two orders of magnitude higher than naively predicted .",
    "the experimental facts of enhanced quarkonium production in fixed - target experiments are not new , dating back to the mid-1970s when @xmath2 hadroproduction was first observed . at that time",
    "it was realized that lowest - order production of @xmath36 in a color - singlet state ( via one intermediate virtual photon or three virtual gluons ) had difficulty accounting for the large cross sections measured,@xcite and the  color evaporation\"@xcite ( or local - duality ) mechanism achieved currency : the @xmath36 pair could be produced in a colored state and later emit a soft gluon to neutralize its color at little or no cost in probability .",
    "recent advances in perturbative qcd have made the predictions of the color - singlet model computable with no free parameters,@xcite allowing it to be definitively ruled out by both fixed - target and collider@xcite measurements . in the regime accessible to fixed - target experiments , questions may still remain as to the applicability of factorization and the role of intrinsic parton @xmath39 .",
    "but the collider data in the previously - inaccessible regime of @xmath40 ( where perturbative calculations ought to be most trustworthy ) have forced theorists to consider seriously additional non - perturbative mechanisms . as a result , the leading candidate models which have emerged are the color - octet model@xcite and an updated color - evaporation model.@xcite these models , while less predictive than the color - singlet model , nevertheless make strong predictions ( for example , that @xmath2 s should be highly polarized at high @xmath41 ) , which can be tested in detail in upcoming experiments . in this connection",
    "we mention fermilab e866 , which should record @xmath42 @xmath1 decays ( in closed aperture ) in the upcoming run , as well as the c0 charm project,@xcite in which a sample of @xmath43 @xmath2 decays could be accumulated , with ( due to the open geometry ) most final - state particles accompanying the @xmath2 also measured .",
    "thus c0 charm holds the possibility of high - statistics measurements of @xmath44 ( as well as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and open - charm ) production at fixed - target energy",
    ".    further data on @xmath4 dependences could also be useful .",
    "energy loss in nuclear matter may be a means to distinguish color - singlet and color - octet charmonium states , since the color - octet state has gluonic quantum numbers and may be strongly absorbed.@xcite distinguishing initial- and final - state @xmath4-dependence mechanisms calls for more data on the @xmath4 dependence of open - charm production at large @xmath5 , another area in which c0 charm could contribute .",
