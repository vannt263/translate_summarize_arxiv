    "quicksort@xcite is one of the most efficient and widely used sorting algorithms .",
    "the major drawback of quicksort is that worst case time complexity of naive implementations of quicksort is @xmath1 with input size @xmath2 . in order to avoid this worst case behavior ,",
    "a variant of quicksort , so - called introsort@xcite , is often used .",
    "there exists another solution to keep the worst case complexity of quicksort @xmath0 .",
    "this is the use of median - of - medians or blum - floyd - pratt - rivest - tarjan ( bfprt ) algorithm  the pivot selection algorithm in the linear median finding algorithm@xcite . despite the theoretical importance of this scheme , because of its somewhat large constant factor , this method have been considered impractical to use as a pivot selection algorithm in quicksort .    in this article ,",
    "contrary to the above widespread view , we show that using bfprt in quicksort is not inefficient , and moreover , considered practical .",
    "indeed , we find that quicksort with median - of - medians shows comparable performance to the well - known optimized quicksort implementations@xcite for random sequence . we also show that the technique for improving performance is not only for the bfprt but also available for other pivoting methods .",
    "the main idea of this article is thinning out the input elements of each pivot selection .",
    "the outline of this idea is given in algorithm [ alg : select - pivot - bfprt ] .",
    "here we thin out the input array @xmath3 and apply the bfprt on only @xmath4 of @xmath3 .",
    "this bfprt based pivot selection method guarantees the total time complexity of sorting to be @xmath5 , even in the case of @xmath6 . we can show this briefly as follows .",
    "bfprt guarantees that @xmath7 of input elements are lesser than the output pivot , and other @xmath7 are greater@xcite .",
    "thus , at least @xmath8 in @xmath3 with length @xmath2 are lesser and other @xmath8 are greater .",
    "this yields that one partition operation reduces the length of @xmath3 from @xmath2 to @xmath9n$ ] even in the worst case .",
    "the total time complexity of sorting is then asymptotically @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "( apply bfprt on @xmath13 , \\bm{a}[s ] , \\bm{a}[2s ] , \\dots , \\bm{a}[(m-1)s]\\right\\}$ ] ) .",
    "the constant factor in the worst case of quicksort with the above method is estimated as follows .",

    "the constant @xmath18 represents the cost of the pivot selection and the partitioning .",
    "if the bound of the complexity of bfprt is @xmath19 , @xmath20 can be bound as @xmath21 because the partitioning requires @xmath22 comparisons in this article . ] .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath23 is then @xmath24 . if @xmath25 then @xmath26 , for example . the lower bound of @xmath23 can be estimated in the same way : @xmath27 .",
    "the idea of thinning out can be applicable for another pivot selection scheme , as long as it takes linear time .",
    "for example , median - of - three@xcite method and median - of - three - medians - of - three ( pseudo - median - of - nine or _",
    "tukey s ninther_)@xcite are widely used pivot selection method . as the extreme case of these strategies , pseudo - median of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) can be considered . here",
    "we introduce another type of thinning method upon the pseudo - median of @xmath28 , as described in algorithm [ alg : select - pivot - pmed3l ] .",

    "[ alg : select - pivot - pmed3l ] is estimated as the following . if @xmath36 and the length of the target array is @xmath28 , alg .",
    "[ alg : select - pivot - pmed3l ] guarantees that at least @xmath37 of the elements are lesser than the selected pivot and other @xmath37 are greater .",
    "thus , for a large array with length @xmath2 , alg .",
    "[ alg : select - pivot - pmed3l ] guarantees that @xmath38 of the elements are greater than the pivot and @xmath38 are lesser .",
    "the depth of recursion @xmath39 for the worst case is then estimated as @xmath40 therefore , the worst case bound of quicksort with alg .",
    "[ alg : select - pivot - pmed3l ] is bound by @xmath41 . because the averaged required comparison in a pivot selection for an array with length @xmath2 is @xmath42 , the lower bound of the complexity of quicksort with this method in the best case is estimated as @xmath43 .",
    "we carried out a numerical experiment to estimate the coefficients of the quicksort with alg .",
    "[ alg : select - pivot - bfprt ] ( t - bfprt ) and alg .",
    "[ alg : select - pivot - pmed3l ] ( t - pmed@xmath28 ) .",
    "we used the standard single pivot partitioning@xcite and the original bfprt algorithm@xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we did not change to another sorting algorithm such as heapsort or insertion sort to sort small subarrays .",
    "we also measured quicksort with random pivot picking ( hoare s original method ) ( rand ) , median - of - three ( med3 ) , and pseudo - median - of - nine ( pmed9 ) for benchmarking our strategy .",
    "we used random sequences of distinct integers as target arrays .",
    "we executed 100 times of sorting by each scheme , obtained the mean and unbiased variance of required count of comparisons , and calculated their coefficients via least squares fittings .    ) . ]    .",
    "we do not plot the line of pmed9 because it almost overlaps that of t - pmed@xmath28(@xmath25 ) . ]",

    "we can see that the performance of t - bfprt with @xmath36 or t - pmed@xmath28 with @xmath46 is not good because of its expensive pivot selection procedure . on the other hand , t - bfprt or t - pmed@xmath28 with @xmath25 exhibits excellent result ; both method beat that of med3 .",
    "table [ tbl : coefficient - by - fitting ] shows the fitting result to the function @xmath47 .",
    "we can see that t - bfprt and t - pmed@xmath28 with large @xmath10 clearly outperform med3 and exhibit comparable result to pmed9 .",
    "figure [ fig : s - dependence ] shows the dependence of the coefficients on @xmath10 . in both methods , the larger @xmath10 is , the more improved the asymptotic behavior is .",
    "because the larger @xmath10 makes the upper bound of the comparison count worse , @xmath10 within the range @xmath48 is probably the best choice in this configuration .",
    "note that the above discussion only considers the number of comparisons and the execution time is another question . as for t - pmed@xmath28",
    ", there is no swapping in pivot selection phase . therefore ,",
    "unless the effect of the memory cache and cost of function calls are not negligible , the execution time shows the same tendency of the comparison count . on the other hand ,",
    "t - bfprt involves data modifications in the pivot selection . in our environment",
    ", it showed the similar tendency of the comparison count .",
    "however , further accurate investigations should be required anyway .",
    "in this article , we show that the use of median - of - medians as a pivot selection algorithm in quicksort is not always inefficient ; it works very well on random sequences , but still requires only @xmath0 comparisons in the worst case .",
    "we also show that the technique of thinning out can also be usable for other pivoting method , and can improve the worst case behavior with keeping good performance for random input",
    ".    there can be many other methods to thinning out the input of pivoting algorithm .",
    "it is easy to make a bad input for alg .",
    "[ alg : select - pivot - bfprt ] ( setting larger elements at the multiple of @xmath49 and last @xmath50 elements ) , but for another thinning method making a bad input may not be as easy as this . also , the methods in this article perform well on neither increasing nor decreasing sequence because of its naive behavior for small subarrays . to fix this , equipping adaptive features ( e.g. , median - of - three for small input ( typically @xmath51 for t - bfprt and @xmath52 for t - pmed@xmath28 ) and the main method for large input ) is effective .",
