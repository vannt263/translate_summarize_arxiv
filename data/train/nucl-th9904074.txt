    "recently , there has been growing interest about the possibility of the formation of a disoriented chiral condensate ( d@xmath1c ) in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision",
    ", some region may thermalize at a temperature high enough so that chiral symmetry is restored in the region . as the system cools sufficiently rapidly back through the transition temperature ,",
    "the chiral restored state is unstable as small fluctuations in any chiral direction ( @xmath8 ) will grow exponentially .",
    "this can create regions where the pion field has a macroscopic occupation number . it should be stressed that this scenario is not derivable directly from the underlying theory of qcd and contains a number of untested dynamical assumptions , principally that the cooling is rapid .",
    "while the failure of the system to form a d@xmath1c can not be used to rule out that the system has reached the chiral restoration temperature ( as the scenario described above is not derivable directly from qcd ) , observation of d@xmath1c formation would be a clear signal for chiral restoration at high temperature .",
    "there are clear signatures of d@xmath1c formation provided a single large domain is formed , containing a large number of pions .",
    "for example , one expects an excess in low @xmath3 pion production as the characteristic momentum of a pion from a large region is small .",
    "such a signal works even if multiple regions of d@xmath1c are formed provided each region is large , but it is not decisive since one could imagine some other collective low energy effects which produce low @xmath3 pions . on the other hand ,",
    "since the pions formed in a d@xmath1c , being essentially classical , form a coherent state , this coherent state has some orientation in isospace , and all of the pions in the domain are essentially maximally aligned ( given the constraints of quantum mechanics ) and point in the same isospin direction .",
    "if there are a large number of pions in the domain , this implies a distinctive distribution of @xmath0 , the ratio of neutral to total pions in the domain @xcite : @xmath9 in contrast , the distribution from uncorrelated emissions is narrowly peaked about @xmath5 with a variance , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of pions , and approaches a delta function at @xmath12 when @xmath13 . since these two distributions are dramatically different , this provides a clear signature for single domain d@xmath1c formation , provided one can kinematically separate the pions from the d@xmath1c from other pions in the system .",
    "unfortunately , this signature depends critically on the assumption that a single large domain of d@xmath1c is formed , which is _ a priori _ rather unlikely .",
    "one expects the domains are of characteristic size @xmath14 , the exponential growth time of the pion fluctuation in the unstable chiral restored state@xcite . since the size of the fireball is much larger than typical qcd length scales , it seems unlikely that @xmath14 would be of the size of the fireball , and thus formation of a single d@xmath1c domain is improbable .",
    "formation of multiple domains of d@xmath1c , however , tends to wash out the @xmath0 distribution described by eq .",
    "( [ pofr ] ) .",
    "as the pions emerging from different domains can not be distinguished kinematically , by the central limit theorem the @xmath0 distribution will approach a normal distribution peaked at @xmath12 .",
    "this normal distribution may be distinguished from the normal distribution arising from uncorrelated emission ; the case of multiple domains of d@xmath1c will have a substantially larger variance .",
    "unfortunately , there is an important practical limitation which makes it difficult to exploit the @xmath0 distribution as a signature . even under the most optimistic of scenarios ,",
    "the total number of pions coming from d@xmath1c s will be a small fraction of the total number of pions .",
    "if one includes all pions produced in the reaction , the signal due to the pions from the d@xmath1c will presumably be overwhelmed .",
    "one can apply a low @xmath3 cut to suppress the noise due to incoherently emitted pions .",
    "however , even with the low @xmath3 cut , the noise may still be severe , as both the signal and the noise peak at @xmath12 . in this paper",
    ", we suggest cuts which may dramatically enhance the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we study the conditional probability distribution of @xmath0 given only for the events in which the @xmath2 pions with the lowest @xmath3 are all neutral , and we will show that the expectation value of @xmath0 is shifted away from @xmath5 . since incoherent emission will result in a very narrow peak around @xmath12 , any such shifts should be easily observable .",
    "moreover , one can make successive cuts by increasing the value of @xmath2 , and enhance the signal in each successive step .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will start with the simple scenario and study single domain d@xmath1c formation in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii the effects of multi - domain formation and the noises due to incoherently emitted pions will be studied , while potential experimental application and limitations will be discussed in sec .",
    "we are going to start with an unrealistic simple scenario and make it more realistic later on in our discussion .",
    "we will consider a single domain which is described by an isosinglet density matrix .",
    "( in general , a d@xmath1c is not a pure state ; the wavefunction of the pion coherent state at the core of the `` fireball '' of the heavy ion collision is entangled with the energetic emission at the edge of the `` fireball '' . ) such a state can be written as @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath17 are real , positive and do not depend on @xmath18 ( as the full state is assumed to be isoscalar ) .",
    "the probability distribution of such a mixed state in the isospace is is much less than @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 where the angles @xmath21 are defined such that a unit vector in isospace is @xmath22 .",
    "the probability distribution is uniform , as the condensate is equally likely to point at any direction on the two - dimensional sphere , as demanded by isospin symmetry .",
    "the number operator of neutral pions in the condensate is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 is a vector of hermitian annihilation operators which annihilate @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 is the expected number of pions . since @xmath29 , .",
    "] one can easily calculate the probability distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath30 by defining @xmath31 ( the subscript `` 0 '' stands for @xmath32 ) , one has , in the limit that @xmath19 is large , @xmath33 recovering eq .",
    "( [ pofr ] ) . the distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the shape is qualitatively different from the poisson ",
    "gaussian distribution due to incoherent emissions .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath0 is @xmath5 , @xmath34 which has the simple interpretation that it is equally likely for the pion to be a @xmath27 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 , and hence on average a third of the pions are neutral .",
    "this distribution is a consequence of the fact that we have assumed the d@xmath1c to be an isosinglet , a reasonable assumption on physical grounds .",
    "however , let s consider the distribution of @xmath0 after the d@xmath1c emits a single @xmath27 . the density matrix after the emission , which can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a normalization constant , @xmath39 is the density matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ domain ] ) and @xmath40 annihilates a neutral pion .",
    "this new density matrix is not an isosinglet .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the probability distribution for this state is @xmath41 or equivalently , @xmath42 the distribution @xmath43 is plotted in fig .  1b , which is drastically different from @xmath44 .",
    "the distribution is skewed towards the high end , while @xmath44 is skewed towards the low end .",
    "moreover , the expectation value of @xmath0 is clearly pushed up : @xmath45 so we have arrived at the intriguing conclusion that , if the `` first pion '' emitted from a isosinglet d@xmath1c is neutral , 60% of the pions subsequently emitted from the d@xmath1c are neutral , a huge enhancement from the original expectation of 33% .",
    "1b    fig .",
    "1d    this extraordinary statement certainly deserves more discussion .",
    "first , what is our criterion to decide which is the `` first pion '' ?",
    "the answer is simple : it can be any criterion .",
    "it does not matter as long as it is _ a priori _ equally likely to be a @xmath27 , a @xmath35 or a @xmath36 .",
    "the derivation just depends on our removing a neutral pion from the isosinglet d@xmath1c .",
    "it can be the first pion emitted in time , or the last one emitted in time , or even the 17th emitted in time .",
    "the criterion can also be unrelated to the order of emission .",
    "for example , we can choose the `` first pion '' to be the one with the smallest polar angle .",
    "one can use any of these criteria to identify the `` first pion '' , and if it turns out to be neutral , then the @xmath0 distribution of subsequent emissions is always given by @xmath43 , provided we are in the large number limit .",
    "however , this is only true in this idealized scenario , when all the pions are coming from a simple d@xmath1c domain . in reality , some of the pions come from incoherent emission , and if the `` first pion '' turns out to be incoherently emitted , the expectation value of @xmath0 of the remaining pions is still going to be @xmath5 , not @xmath6 . as a result",
    ", we want to choose our criterion in such a way that the `` first pion '' is likely to originate from the d@xmath1c and not from incoherent emissions . since d@xmath1c pions by hypothesis have low @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the size of the domain , a natural choice is to use the pion with the lowest @xmath3 as our `` first pion '' .    after clarifying the meaning of the term `` first pion ''",
    ", we move on to discuss the physical origin of the modification of the probability distribution of @xmath0 . in a nutshell",
    ", we are seeing the physics of ( iso)spin alignment due to bose condensation . to illustrate the point ,",
    "let us first consider the following apparently unrelated stern ",
    "gerlach experiment .",
    "consider a large number of massive spin-1 particles , which for concreteness will be called deuterons .",
    "initially they are all polarized along a randomly chosen direction @xmath48 , which is _ a priori _ equally likely to be any direction in three dimensional space . in other words , @xmath49 for all the deuterons .",
    "now let us pick one of these deuterons and pass it through a stern  gerlach spectrometer which measures @xmath50 , the spin along the @xmath51-axis .",
    "what is the probability that the measurement gives @xmath52 ?",
    "the answer is clearly @xmath5 , as the cases for @xmath53 , 0 and @xmath54 are equally likely . on the other hand , if the measurement on the first deuteron gives @xmath52 , what is the conditional probability for the next deuteron to pass through the stern ",
    "gerlach spectrometer also to be measured to have @xmath52 ?",
    "the answer this time is no longer @xmath5 .",
    "the spins of all the deuterons are aligned along the same direction @xmath48 , and that the first deuteron is measured to have @xmath52 suggests @xmath48 is more probable to be more or less aligned along @xmath55 than otherwise . as a result , the conditional probability is no longer @xmath5 , but can be easily shown to be @xmath6 , which is exactly the predicted value for @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ 3/5 ] ) .",
    "the situation for a single domain of d@xmath1c is analogous , with isospin aligned pions instead of spin aligned deuterons . by construction , the pions in a d@xmath1c domain are isospin aligned , and by the same analysis",
    ", we have shown that the knowledge of the `` first pion '' being neutral can dramatically modify the conditional probability distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "one can also consider the conditional probability distribution of @xmath0 in the case that the `` first pion '' is charged .",
    "note that @xmath57 and hence , since @xmath58 , @xmath59 the expectation value of @xmath0 , given that the `` first pion '' is charged , can be easily shown to be @xmath60 . as a consistency check",
    ", one can calculate @xmath4 , the expectation value of @xmath0 regardless of the species of the `` first pion '' .",
    "since the `` first pion '' is twice as likely to be charged as to be neutral , @xmath61 agreeing with eq .",
    "( [ 1/3 ] ) .",
    "lastly , we will study the conditional probability distribution of @xmath0 given that the @xmath2 pions with the lowest @xmath3 , which will be hereafter referred to as the `` first @xmath2 pions '' , are all neutral .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in this case @xmath62 and @xmath63 the distributions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are plotted in fig .",
    "1c and d , respectively .",
    "one can see that as @xmath2 increases , the distribution is more and more skewed towards the high end . as a result , the expectation value of @xmath0 increases with @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath66 it is useful to define @xmath67 as the ratio of the number of @xmath35 to the number of total pions emitted . by symmetry",
    "it is also the ratio of the number of @xmath36 to the number of total pions emitted , and since @xmath68 , @xmath69    from the above analysis , the prescription to enhance the collective signal is quite clear .",
    "one should make successive cuts on the data sample on the condition that the @xmath2 pions with the lowest @xmath3 are all neutral , and measure @xmath70 after each cut to see if it increases as predicted in eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) .",
    "this result , however , depends on the assumption that we have only a single domain of d@xmath1c without any contamination due to incoherent pion emissions .",
    "since this assumption is unrealistic for heavy ion collision experiments , the scenario we studied in this section is only an idealized situation . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss more realistic scenarios .",
    "the scenario considered in the last section is highly unrealistic in at least two ways .",
    "first , as discussed in the introduction , single domain d@xmath1c formation is highly unlikely . for a realistic treatment",
    "one must study d@xmath1c formation with more than one domain , each pointing in a different direction in the isospace .",
    "moreover , we have neglected the effect of incoherently emitted pions , which have very important effects .",
    "if the neutral `` first pion '' is incoherently emitted , the @xmath0 distribution of the remaining pions is described by @xmath44 , instead of @xmath43 when the `` first pion '' comes from the d@xmath1c . in this section",
    ", we will incorporate these two effects and see how the predictions above are modified .",
    "we will study the expectation value of @xmath0 , or equivalently the expectation of @xmath67 , for a situation described by the following parameters .",
    "the coherent fraction @xmath1 is the fraction of pions which originate from d@xmath1c domains , so that when @xmath71 , all pions are coherently emitted , and when @xmath72 , all pions are incoherently emitted .",
    "we will consider the case where there are @xmath73 domains , all containing an equal number of pions , which will be assumed to be large .",
    "each domain is described by an isosinglet density matrix , but the isospins of pions in different domains are uncorrelated .",
    "now the question is : if the `` first @xmath2 pions '' in this channel are all neutral , what are the expectation values of @xmath0 and @xmath67 among the rest of the pions ?    the answer turns out to be the following expression :    @xmath74    the shift @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 [ result ]    each term in this formula has a simple interpretation :    @xmath78 the expectation value @xmath4 is always @xmath5 for the incoherently emitted pions .",
    "only the pions coming from the domains are affected by isospin alignment ; hence the outstanding factor of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath78 each coherently emitted pion comes from one of the domains , which will be called domain x. how many of the `` first @xmath2 pions '' also come from domain x ?",
    "the probability for each pion coming from domain x is @xmath79 , and the probability that @xmath80 of the `` first @xmath2 pions '' coming from domain x is @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath78 given that @xmath80 of the `` first @xmath2 pions '' is coming from domain x , the conditional expectation value of @xmath67 decreases from @xmath5 to @xmath82 , while the conditional expectation value of @xmath0 increases by twice the above quantity .    in passing ,",

    "we have made contour plots of @xmath85 ( such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , for @xmath88 in the @xmath89 parameter space .",
    "the horizontal axis is the coherent fraction @xmath1 while the vertical axis is @xmath90 where @xmath73 is the number of domains .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath90 range from 0 to 1 .",
    "thus , for example , with 3 domains and @xmath91 , in order to have @xmath92 we must have @xmath93 .",
    "equations ( [ result ] ) illustrate the main results of this paper .",
    "one can see that , without any d@xmath1c formation , @xmath72 ( corresponding to the left edge of fig .  2 ) , @xmath75 vanishes , and @xmath94 as expected .",
    "the bottom edge of the plot corresponds to @xmath95 and also gives @xmath96 for any finite value of @xmath2 .",
    "the shift @xmath75 is largest for a single domain of d@xmath1c without any noise due to incoherently emitted pions , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath97 ( the top right corner of the contour plots ) , giving @xmath98 and reproducing eqs .",

    "@xmath90    @xmath1    one expects that when the number of d@xmath1c domains is large ( @xmath101 ) or when most of the pions are incoherently emitted ( @xmath102 ) , it will be difficult to observe clear signals of d@xmath1c formation .",
    "however , in such situations @xmath103 is small and @xmath75 is dominated by the @xmath104 term ( the @xmath105 term always identically vanishes ) and @xmath106 thus a large @xmath2 may make up for a small coherent fraction @xmath1 , or a large number of domains @xmath73 , and enhance @xmath75 , which describes the shift of @xmath4 and @xmath107 from @xmath5 , to an experimentally measurable magnitude . from the form of eq .",
    "( [ small ] ) , one expects this shift to be substantial whenever @xmath108 .",
    "however , even for a value of @xmath2 as small as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , which translates to @xmath111 and @xmath87  a substantial deviation from the incoherent case .",
    "this suggests one should make successive cuts for events where the @xmath2 pions with lowest @xmath3 are all neutral , and study @xmath4 after each cut .",
    "an increase of @xmath4 with @xmath2 would suggest that d@xmath1c domains are formed .",
    "equation ( [ small ] ) appears to suggest that one can increase @xmath75 to an arbitrarily large magnitude by choosing a sufficiently large value of @xmath2 .",
    "of course this is not true .",
    "equation ( [ small ] ) is obtained as the leading term in a @xmath103 expansion , but when @xmath112 , this expansion breaks down as terms of higher order in @xmath103 are enhanced by factors of @xmath113 .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath114 in other words , our signal enhancement scheme is fundamentally limited by the amount of noise due to incoherently emitted pions .",
    "when @xmath1 is small , most of the pions are incoherently emitted , and for them , @xmath4 is always around @xmath5 regardless of what cuts one makes . on the other hand , the large @xmath2 limit of @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath73 , the number of d@xmath1c domains . recall that we have several distinctive signatures , like the @xmath0 distribution in eq .",
    "( [ pofr ] ) and the conditional expectation values for @xmath0 described in the previous section , for a single domain of d@xmath1c , where all the pions in the d@xmath1c are isospin aligned . with multi - domain formation , where the pions in different domains may point to different directions in isospace , the effect of isospin alignment is greatly washed out . however , given that the `` first @xmath2 pions '' are all neutral with @xmath115 , it is probabilistically extremely likely that each of the @xmath73 domains is the origin of some of these `` first @xmath2 pions '' . as a result ,",
    "each of these @xmath73 domains are well - aligned along the @xmath27 direction , and hence also well - aligned with each other . as @xmath116 , the @xmath73 domains look more and more like a single big domain in the @xmath27 direction , which is the case where the signature is the most dramatic . in short , with large @xmath2 , our cuts are picking out the events where the signals are the strongest , and hence resulting in a large signal - to - noise ratio .    in above we have assumed the sizes of all @xmath73 domains are identical for illustrative purposes .",
    "a more realistic treatment would have @xmath73 domains , each with different sizes @xmath117 , @xmath118 , such that @xmath119 .",
    "( the size of a domain is defined to be the fraction of pions which originate from this particular domain . ) then eqs .",
    "( [ result ] ) are generalized to @xmath120 in the weak signal limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , when all the @xmath117 s are small , eq .  ( [ small ] ) gets modified to @xmath121 where @xmath122 has the following nice interpretation : @xmath123 is the average over all pions ( both coherently and incoherently emitted ) of the sizes of the originating domains , which is @xmath117 for a pion from domain @xmath124 and zero for an incoherently emitted pion .",
    "for @xmath73 domains of equal sizes , @xmath125 and eq .",
    "( [ small ] ) is recovered .",
    "again we see that @xmath75 grows linearly with @xmath2 in the weak signal limit . as @xmath116 the shift @xmath75",
    "is again limited by the bound ( [ limit ] ) , which applies also for the cases of unequal domain sizes .",
    "to recapitulate , we suggest the following experimental procedures :                    @xmath78 repeat the above prescription of making successive cuts to retain only events in which the pion with the next lowest @xmath3 is also neutral , and calculate @xmath4 for each rapidity window after each cut .",
    "if we find @xmath4 deviates from @xmath5 then we are seeing signatures from d@xmath1cs .",
    "note that this prescription requires reconstructions of @xmath3 s of individual pions , both charged and neutral .",
    "we have also presumed that the coherent fraction @xmath1 and the number of domains formed @xmath73 are roughly the same for each event .",
    "( more specifically , the probability distributions for @xmath1 and @xmath73 are narrow peaked . )    by applying these successive cuts , we are retaining the events with d@xmath1c formation _ and _ most of the pions are well - aligned along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "what is being cut are the events with d@xmath1c formation but most of the pions are well - aligned along the @xmath126 or @xmath127 directions , and the events where there are incoherent pions with very low @xmath3 , which is the main source of noise to our signal . as a result",
    ", these successive cuts are substantially improving the signal - to - noise ratio , making it easier to observe d@xmath1c formation . on the other hand , just like any other cuts on data to suppress the noises , we are giving up on statistics .",
    "moreover , for large @xmath2 we are cutting on rare events so the loss in statistics can be severe .",
    "for the cases where the signal is weak ( small coherent fraction @xmath102 or large number of domains @xmath128 ) on each cut we are losing about two - thirds of the events .    in conclusion , we have devised new cuts to enhance the signal in searches for d@xmath1c .",
    "these cuts retain only events where the @xmath2 pions with lowest @xmath3 are all neutral .",
    "we have shown that , after these cuts , the fraction of neutral pions within the remaining sample is substantially larger if d@xmath1cs are formed in the heavy ion collision .",

    "<S> for example , for a single d@xmath1c domain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions , @xmath4 is @xmath6 given the pion with lowest @xmath3 is neutral , and @xmath7 given the two pions with lowest @xmath3 are both neutral , _ </S>",
