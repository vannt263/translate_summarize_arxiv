    "in addition , they are expected to include dusty gas - rich systems with an impulsive , very intense star - formation activity ( i.e. starbursts ) , and the early , dusty post - starburst phases of galaxy formation that started at @xmath28 ( pierini et al .",
    "2004a ) .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the observed _ extremely red galaxies _ ( with e.g. @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) are very heterogeneous ( smail et al . 2002 ; yan & thompson 2003 ; cimatti et al . 2003 ; stevens et al . 2003 ; gilbank et al . 2003 ; moustakas et al . 2004 ; see mccarthy 2004 for a review ) .",
    "morphological classifications using surface brightness profile - fitting ( cimatti et al .",

    "they also confirm that a further 3037 per cent is made of spheroidal or compact systems ( see yan & thompson 2003 ) , while at least 15 per cent is made of disturbed or irregular objects .",

    "for all these reasons , it is puzzling that extremely red optical / near - ir colours are never achieved by models of an evolving , dusty sb - type galaxy at @xmath34 , according to visnen & johansson ( 2004 ) .",
    "interestingly , 40 per cent of the yan & thompson ( 2003 ) disky systems ( i.e. either disk - dominated or bulge - less ) with @xmath13 and @xmath14 are viewed almost edge on ( i.e. at an inclination of @xmath5 90 ) .",
    "their extremely red colours are tentatively attributed to the attenuation of stellar light by dust distributed in their disks . according to yan & thompson ,",

    "all 6 large disk - like galaxies have a `` red '' nucleus , while their optical / near - ir colours become bluer in the outer parts .",
    "labb et al .",
    "( 2003 ) can not provide a definitive interpretation of these observables , but suggest several ones : more dust , higher age , emission - line contamination , or a combination of effects , in the galaxy centres .",

    "thus , they have been called _ distant red galaxies _ ( van dokkum et al .",

    "this key assumption for the sed modeling is questionable . in the local universe ,",
    "the characteristics of dust attenuation are different between starbursts , normal star - forming ( i.e. non starburst ) disk galaxies ( bell 2002 ; gordon et al .",

    "therefore , it is fundamental to understand if the optical / near - ir colours of drdgs and erdgs are due either to the luminosity - weighted age of the stellar populations present in the system or to reddening by internal dust .    to this purpose",
    ", we combine evolutionary synthesis models of stellar populations ( maraston 1998 , 2005 ) with models of radiative transfer of the stellar and scattered radiation through the dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) of a disk system ( ferrara et al .",
    "1999 ; pierini et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "the stellar population evolutionary synthesis models used here include the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase for intermediate - mass ( 25 @xmath54 ) stars , at variance with all others ( maraston 2005 ) .",
    "this phase is fundamental for computing correctly the seds of intermediate - age ( i.e. between 0.2 and 12 gyr ) stellar populations ( see maraston 1998 , 2005 ) .",
    "the radiative transfer models ( including multiple scattering ) for the disk geometry used here describe how the attenuation function changes in absolute value and shape with total amount of dust and inclination of the disk , for different dust / stars configurations and different structures of the dusty ism .",
    "we assume that stellar populations are formed starting from an initial star - formation redshift @xmath55 equal to 10 .",
    "this value is between the two redshifts considered by ciardi & madau ( 2003 ) as markers of the epoch of reionization breakthrough in their `` late reionization '' and `` early reionization '' scenarios .",
    "we assume the so - called @xmath56cdm `` concordance '' cosmological model ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) with hubble constant @xmath59 , consistent with the main _ wmap _ results ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , in order to link age ( i.e. the time that has elapsed since star formation started ) and redshift .    observed red disk - like galaxies span the redshift range 0.73 , so that we consider six representative redshifts for candidate drdgs and erdgs , i.e. @xmath60 , 1.07 , 1.39 , 1.85 , 2.59 , and 3.19 , that correspond to maximum ages of the stellar populations equal to 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , and 1.5 gyr , respectively , for @xmath61 .",
    "we compute additional models , where the stellar populations have a maximum age of 0.6 gyr for any of the previous 6 redshifts , with the intent of constraining the lowest value of the parameter @xmath55 that is necessary to reproduce the observed optical / near - ir colours of drdgs and erdgs .",
    "we model the intrinsic ( i.e. non attenuated by internal dust ) sed of a dusty , bulge - less disk galaxy as a composite stellar population with solar metallicity ( @xmath62 ) and a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and @xmath63 .",
    "solar metallicities seem to be present in massive , star - forming galaxies at @xmath22 ( shapley et al .",
    "2004 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "a `` normal '' imf seems to be established when the ism metallicity reaches a value of @xmath64 ( schneider et al .",
    "furthermore , the salpeter imf describes in a consistent way different properties of the universe at least up to @xmath38 ( renzini 2004 ) .",
    "the intrinsic seds of the composite stellar populations are computed with the evolutionary synthesis code of maraston ( 1998 , 2005 ) .",
    "the models include the contribution by the tp - agb phase .",
    "tp - agb stars are cool giants exhibiting very red optical / near - ir colours ( e.g. persson et al .",
    "they provide about 40 per cent of the bolometric luminosity and up to 80 per cent of the rest - frame k - band luminosity of an intermediate - age simple stellar population ( ssp ) ( maraston 1998 , 2005 ) .",
    "they are expected to play a significant role in the near - ir emission of galaxies containing 1 gyr - old stellar populations , since the fuel consumption during the tp - agb phase is maximum around this age ( maraston 1998 , 2005 ) .",
    "more generally , these stars must be included in any realistic modeling of stellar populations , since intermediate - mass stars do unavoidably experience the tp - agb phase .    in the framework of this study",
    ", the effect of the tp - agb stars will matter when the r , i , j , and k bands ( i.e. those used to select high-@xmath1 red galaxies ) map the rest - frame near - ir .",
    "therefore the lower redshift bins will be affected .",
    "since the tp - agb phase is usually not included in population synthesis models ( see maraston 2005 for examples ) , we have considered also some models in which the tp - agb phase is neglected .",
    "this allows us to compare our results with others in the literature . with respect to the latter",
    ", we will show in sect .",
    "3.2.2 that the physically - motivated presence of tp - agb stars softens the need either of dominant , old , passively evolving stellar populations or of large , arbitrary values of reddening by dust associated with high sfrs to explain the observed red optical / near - ir colours of high-@xmath1 galaxies .    the time dependence of the sfrmaraston",

    "star - formation time scales as short as 3 gyr may sound atypical , if one wants to describe properties of local , `` quiescent '' star - forming galaxies ( see kong et al .",

    "hence , a sfr e - folding time ( eq .",
    "1 ) or a sfr characteristic time scale ( eq .",

    "the bulge - less hypothesis is explored because of the observational evidences reported in sect .",
    "1 . in addition",
    ", we note that hints come from recent evolutionary models of star - forming , gas - rich disks ( immeli et al .",
    "2004 ) that these systems may remain bulge - less for a large part of the hubble time , if the energy dissipation of the cold cloud component is inefficient . in this case",
    ", the global sfr has a time dependence that is broadly analogous in shape to that given by eq .",
    "2 , with a time scale longer than about 2 gyr . we may then expect that at least disk - galaxy models with @xmath84 given by eq . 2 and @xmath71 set equal to 35 remain bulge - less within the redshift range under study .",
    "we postulate that this is so also for models where @xmath84 is given by eq . 1 with @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that the high-@xmath1 , red disk - like galaxies are axially symmetric systems , where the 3-d distribution either of stars or of dust can be parameterized by a doubly exponential law .",
    "the dust / stars configuration is preserved , whether the average disk size ( for fixed luminosity ) changes as a function of redshift or not ( cf .",
    "ferguson et al . 2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ; ravindranath et al .",

    "the dust / stars configuration and the properties of the dusty ism of high-@xmath1 galaxies are not well constrained by existing observations .",
    "therefore , we adopt two different sets of monte carlo calculations of radiative transfer for the disk geometry , that embrace most of the parameter space defined by dust / stars configuration , structure of the dusty ism , and dust type , that is either explored in the literature ( see bianchi 2004 for a recent review ) or known from observations of normal star - forming disk galaxies in the local universe ( white , keel , & conselice 2000 ; keel & white 2001 ; dalcanton , yoachim , & bernstein 2004 ; whittet 2003 and references therein ) .    the first set of simulations is taken from pierini et al .",
    "( 2004b ) ; it illustrates results from radiative transfer models for the bulge and disk components of a late - type galaxy , based on the dirty code ( gordon et al .",
    "these models have been applied successfully to interpret multiwavelength photometry of edge - on late - type galaxies in the local universe ( kuchinski et al .",
    "1998 ) . here",
    "we summarize their relevant features .",
    "the radial distribution is the same for stars and dust , while the scale height of the stellar component decreases with decreasing wavelength of the stellar emission .",
    "the young stars responsible of the bulk uv emission are the most embedded in the large - scale dust distribution , that can be considered analogous to a geometrically - thin dust lane . as for the structure of the dusty ism , this can be either homogeneous ( i.e. diffuse ) or two - phase , clumpy ( i.e. the ism contains diffuse gas plus molecular clouds ) .",
    "dust clumps are distributed stochastically with respect to each other and to the bluest stars ; the most opaque ones are located in the inner disk .",
    "the physical properties of the dust grains are assumed to be the same as those in the diffuse ism of the milky way ( from witt & gordon 2000 ) .",
    "the opacity of the disk is equal to @xmath88 , with @xmath89 equal to 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 . for reference , the opacity of local disks ranges between 0.5 and 2 ( kuchinski et al .",
    "finally , only three values for the inclination @xmath90 of the disk are explored here ( 0 , 70 , and 90 degrees ) , since reddening changes slowly with @xmath90 , for @xmath91(e.g .",

    "2004b ) .",
    "the second set of simulations is taken from ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . there",
    ", the scale height of the stellar distribution does not depend on the wavelength of the tracing photons , and both the scale height and the scale length of the dust distribution are allowed to be larger than those of the stellar distribution .",
    "as these authors discuss , the dust - to - stars scale - height ratio has a larger effect on the attenuation function than the dust - to - stars scale - length ratio .",
    "therefore , we consider three dust / stars configurations , where dust and stars have the same scale length , and the dust - to - stars scale - height ratio is equal to 0.4 ( corresponding to a geometrically - thin dust lane ) , 1 , or 2.5 .",
    "ferrara et al .",
    "consider only the presence of a dusty , diffuse ( or homogeneous ) ism , but with two choices for the mixture of dust grains , namely like in the milky way ( mw ) or in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , as given by gordon , calzetti , & witt ( 1997 ) .",
    "the two dust types produce very different extinction curves at rest - frame wavelengths shorter than @xmath92 , which impacts on the observed @xmath93 and @xmath94 magnitudes of objects with redshift down to 2.5 and 1.7 , respectively .",
    "the continuum of observed dust extinction curves is possibly caused by the environmental stresses of nearby star - formation activity ( gordon et al .",
    "finally , we consider @xmath89 equal to 0.05 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2.5 , and 5 , and set @xmath90 equal to 9.3 , 70 , and 90 degrees .",
    "both sets of monte carlo computations of radiative transfer assume that the dustiest region of a disk is its centre .",
    "hence , they consider the hypothesis that the nuclear , redder seds of the 6 high-@xmath1 , large disk - like galaxies discovered by labb et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are due to a larger dust attenuation .",
    "conversely , these calculations do not take into account the existence of a radial gradient in the distribution of the stellar populations , a second possibility suggested by labb et al . as a cause for the colour gradients existing between the inner and outer regions of their sample galaxies .",
    "we do not apply corrections for dimming due either to continuum and line absorption by atomic hydrogen ( hi ) , or to line absorption by metals , or to continuum absorption by dust , where the hi gas , metals , and dust are distributed in foreground media ( clumpy or diffuse ) of galactic or intergalactic nature .",
    "hereafter we explain our reasons .    for @xmath95 (",
    "i.e. the maximum redshift considered for our models ) , the hi ly@xmath96 transition at @xmath97 ( rest frame ) is red - shifted to @xmath98 , thus shortward of the wavelength domain probed by the @xmath94 broad - band filter .",
    "hence , the effects of the stochastic attenuation produced by intervening hi gas ( madau 1995 ) do not affect at all the computation of the observed @xmath94 magnitude and , a fortiori , of the other observed magnitudes considered in this study ( see tab .",
    "on the other hand , metal - line absorption associated with foreground systems ( e.g. the damped ly@xmath96 systems , see dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2004 ) is expected to affect in a negligible way the observed optical / near - ir magnitudes and colours of galaxies at @xmath0 . the cumulative effect on the optical / near - ir broad - band photometry of galaxies at these redshifts due to absorption by dust associated with",
    "individual damped ly@xmath96 systems , stochastically distributed along the line of sight , is also expected to be very small for the dust - to - gas ratios typically inferred in these systems ( see charlot & fall 1991 ; haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "however , continuum absorption by dust distributed in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be a source of concern especially for the observed @xmath94 and @xmath93 magnitudes and , thus , for the observed @xmath8 and @xmath99 colours of objects at @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , this is true if the amount of igm dust is close to the maximum value estimated by inoue & kamaya ( 2004 ) , which is constrained by extinction and reddening of distant type ia supernovae and by the thermal history of the igm affected by dust photoelectric heating .",
    "the physics of the ejection of dust from the ism of a galaxy to the igm is complex ( aguirre 1999 ; bianchi & ferrara 2005 and references therein ) and opens quite different possibilities as for the igm extinction law ( see aguirre 1999 ; inoue & kamaya 2004 ; bianchi & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , if only grains with sizes larger than @xmath100 populate the igm with an abundance large enough to account for the observed type ia supernova dimming at @xmath101 ( aguirre 1999 ) , we expect the observed @xmath8 and @xmath99 colours computed for our models with @xmath15 to be underestimated by up to a few tenths of a magnitude",
    ". this underestimate would be important , if true .",
    "however , the preferred interpretation for the dimming of type ia supernovae is the cosmological origin ( see de bernardis et al . 2000 ; spergel et al . 2003 ) . furthermore ,",
    "despite the present knowledge of the dusty igm is poor , a dynamical model for the metal enrichment of the igm at @xmath102 through dust sputtering ( bianchi & ferrara 2005 ) suggests that extinction and gas photoelectric heating effects due to igm dust grains are well below current detection limits .    in conclusion ,",
    "the computed @xmath94 , @xmath93 , j , and k magnitudes , and @xmath8 , @xmath99 , and @xmath25 colours reflect directly the properties assumed either for the stellar populations or for the dusty ism of the high-@xmath1 disks .",

    "the explanation of this apparent paradox is the following . for an edge - on disk with @xmath111 ,",
    "the dust column density along the line of sight , averaged over the projection of the stellar disk onto the sky plane , is lower the larger the dust - to - stars scale - height ratio .",
    "in addition , scattering on dust grains is directed forward at the rest - frame uv ",

    "a similar explanation applies to the behaviour of the observed k magnitude .",
    "dust grains not only absorb less but also scatter less and at a wide angle at the rest - frame visual  near - ir wavelengths probed by the k band . hence , for an edge - on disk with @xmath111 , more ( rest - frame ) visual  near - ir photons will be returned to the observer s line of sight , traveling through the dusty disk along different directions initially , the larger the dust - to - stars scale - height ratio .",
    "figure 3 shows that a change in the extinction law has a relevant impact on the @xmath94 magnitude when the @xmath94 band maps rest - frame uv wavelengths .",
    "for instance , for @xmath95 , smc - type dust produces a fainter @xmath94 magnitude with respect to mw - type dust , the relative dimming being of 0.60.8 mag at maximum , as a function of inclination , for the models with dust - to - stars scale - height ratio equal to 2.5 and @xmath113 gyr reproduced there .",
    "this differential effect is reduced for @xmath114 , when the red - shifted @xmath115-absorption feature of mw - type dust falls inside the @xmath94 band ; it amounts up to 0.3 mag for lower redshifts of the models .",
    "smc - type dust produces also a slightly fainter k magnitude , by 0.25 mag at maximum , with respect to mw - type dust . in conclusion , studies aimed at unraveling the extinction curves of high-@xmath1 objects are urged ( e.g. hirashita et al . 2005 ) .    as it can be inferred from fig .",

    "as often discussed in the literature , an alternative explanation for the red colours of real , star - forming disk galaxies at high @xmath1 is that they are not pure disks , but do contain a bulge .",
    "besides usually containing older stellar populations , a bulge suffers from a larger dust attenuation at rest - frame optical / near - ir wavelengths than a disk , for intermediate / low inclinations .",
    "the latter property is a consequence of the difference in dust / stars configuration for the two components ( see ferrara et at . 1999 ; tuffs et al . 2004 ; pierini et al .",
    "however before relying on this solution , one has possibly to check the morphology .",
    "for instance , only a small fraction of the 24 @xmath37-selected objects of the yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample seems to be bulge - dominated . on the other hand , of the 24 @xmath159-selected objects with @xmath160 visually classified in both the r and @xmath39 images simultaneously by sawicki et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , eleven show clear evidence for the presence of disks , and 10 of the latter eleven exhibit a bulge .",

    "when the youngest stars are assumed to be the most embedded in geometrically - thin lanes with e.g. mw - type dust ( models a1 through b2 ) , edge - on disk models can exhibit both @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath161 and @xmath15 , or even @xmath2 for @xmath122 and @xmath162 ( see fig .",

    "disk galaxies with geometrically - thin dust lanes seem to have rotational velocities higher than @xmath166 ( dalcanton et al .",

    "the disk is prone to fragmentation and gravitational collapse along spiral arms .",
    "if these results apply to high-@xmath1 disk - like galaxies with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , these objects can be expected to experience a relatively efficient , rapid star - formation activity .",
    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath167 exhibit @xmath168 ( sawicki & yee 1998 ) .",
    "their optical and near - ir colours are reproduced fairly well by the starburst models of vijh , witt , & gordon ( 2003 ) , and seem to be due to reddening by smc - type dust .    however , our models of dusty , continuously star - forming disks with ages of 1.52 gyr at @xmath15 exhibit @xmath169 , for a wide region of the explored parameter space ( cf .",
    "fig . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "they exhibit bluer near - ir colours ( down to @xmath170 ) , if their stellar populations have maximum ages of about 0.6 gyr ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "this suggests that some of the lbgs with the reddest near - ir colours at @xmath167 can be dusty star - forming disks with a prolonged star - formation activity ( i.e. with intermediate - age / old stellar populations ) and not dusty young starbursts .",
    "an accurate determination of the dynamical mass or , in its absence , of the stellar mass for lbgs at @xmath167 can tell if the reddest ones are relatively low - mass starburst systems or massive systems still in the making .",
    "an alternative discriminating tool is mid - ir ( observed frame ) spectroscopy , since the rest - frame visual  near - ir sed of an intermediate - age ssp is characterized by molecular absorption bands originated in the atmospheres of tp - agb stars ( maraston 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "sub - mm galaxies ( smgs , or `` scuba sources '' ) with confirmed counterparts ( based on accurate positions from radio , co , and/or millimeter continuum interferometric observations ) exhibit a median @xmath171 ( frayer et al .",

    "however , the smg investigated by greve , ivison , & papadopoulos ( 2003 ) seems to be a very large ( several tens of kiloparsecs ) system where the dust distribution is more extended than the stellar one , maybe owing to the presence of strong galactic winds .",
    "this dust / stars configuration is reminiscent of the ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) configuration s01_me25 ( or s01_se25 ) that is included in models b5 ( or b8 , see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this analogy is intriguing .",

    "therefore , it is important to realize that , according to our models , drdgs may have near - ir colours as red as those of some smgs , without being necessarily much dustier than the milky way .",
    "however , none of our models achieves the reddest near - ir colours observed so far ( @xmath1204 , maihara et al .",

    "the adoption of arbitrary , single - colour selection criteria introduces a bias not only in redshift but also in the intrinsic properties of the selected objects , as intended at least in part ( see yan & thompson 2003 ; pierini et al . 2004a ; daddi et al . 2004 ; yan et al . 2004 ) .",
    "theoretically , this bias arises from the combination of the different rest - frame wavelength ranges probed by the individual broad - band filters with the intrinsic properties ( stellar populations and dusty ism ) of the high-@xmath1 systems .",
    "we illustrate these combined effects through the following example based on our models of dusty , continuously star - forming disks at @xmath0 .    down to a fixed k - magnitude limit",
    ", the @xmath2 colour - selection criterion drops more ( edge - on ) disk models than the @xmath3 colour - selection criterion . for an aging ,",

    "in fact , the difference in attenuation at the two neighboring rest - frame wavelengths probed by the @xmath94 and @xmath93 filters diminishes when either the inclination or the opacity increases ( see ferrara et al .",

    "this is so even if the extinction law is of mw type , i.e. has a local absorption peak at @xmath115 . as a result ,",
    "an aging , dusty star - forming disk at @xmath183 turns out to be `` too blue '' for the @xmath2 colour - selection criterion .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath177 , the age of the model is about 5.3 gyr and the exact value of the sfr e - folding time becomes important , since now the @xmath94 filter probes also rest - frame near - uv wavelengths , while the @xmath93 filter probes rest - frame wavelengths around the @xmath27-break .",
    "the previous considerations on dust attenuation still apply however . as a result ,",
    "an aging , dusty , star - forming disk at @xmath38 turns out to be `` red enough '' for the @xmath3 colour - selection criterion .",

    "disks represent the building blocks of all galaxies with a spheroidal component if the hierarchical galaxy - formation theory holds ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "they also represent the ancestors of bulge@xmath20disk galaxies at @xmath74 for the different scenarios of the so - called `` secular evolution '' of the bulge - to - disk hubble sequence , that explain the formation of the bulge component via different mechanisms of disk instability ( see combes 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore under which conditions of dust attenuation and stellar populations , models with exponentially declining star - formation histories ( like those of disks in the local universe ) and without a bulge meet the above mentioned colour - selection criteria .",
    "these disk models start forming stars at @xmath61 and at redshifts between 3.2 and 0.8 have ages between 1.56 gyr , solar metallicity , and salpeter imf . at variance with other stellar population models ,",
    "the evolutionary synthesis code used here ( maraston 1998 , 2005 ) includes the contribution of the thermally pulsating phase of an intermediate - mass ( 25 m@xmath185 ) star along the asymptotic giant branch ( i.e. the tp - agb phase ) .",
    "the tp - agb stars are fundamental for computing correctly the emission contribution from intermediate - age ( between 0.2 and 12 gyr old ) , simple stellar populations longward of the rest - frame v band .",
    "the properties of dust attenuation are described by monte carlo calculations of radiative transfer of the stellar and scattered radiation through different dusty ism for a doubly exponential disk geometry ( ferrara et al .",

    "therefore the present study complement the others in the literature in which the so - called `` calzetti law '' ( calzetti et al . 2000 ) for starbursts is assumed in order to describe dust attenuation in all star - forming systems at high @xmath1 .    as a first main result",
    ", our synthetic , dusty , star - forming disks at @xmath0 can exhibit red optical / near - ir colours because of reddening by dust , but only if they have been forming stars for more than @xmath5 1 gyr . otherwise , one has to resort to different characteristics of dust attenuation from those of disks in the local universe , and/or to star - formation time scales much shorter than 3 gyr , and/or to the existence of an additional bulge component .",
    "moreover , our disk models barely exhibit @xmath2 at @xmath9 .",

    "<S> we investigate which conditions of dust attenuation and stellar populations allow models of dusty , continuously star - forming , bulge - less disk galaxies at @xmath0 to meet the different colour selection criteria of high-@xmath1 `` red '' galaxies ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) . as a main novelty , </S>",
    "<S> we use stellar population models that include the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase of stellar evolution . the star formation rate of the models declines exponentially as a function of time , the e - folding time being longer than 3 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we use calculations of radiative transfer of the stellar and scattered radiation through different dusty interstellar media in order to explore the wide parameter space of dust attenuation . we find that synthetic disks can exhibit red optical / near - infrared colours because of reddening by dust , but only if they have been forming stars for at least @xmath5 1 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> extremely few models barely exhibit @xmath2 , if the inclination @xmath6and if the opacity @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath8-selected galaxies at @xmath9 most probably are either systems with an old , passively evolving bulge or starbursts . synthetic disks at @xmath9 exhibit @xmath10 , if they are seen edge on ( i.e. at @xmath11 ) and if @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the large fraction of observed , edge - on disk - like galaxies with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , models with @xmath15 exhibit @xmath16 , with no bias towards @xmath11and for a large range in opacity ( e.g. @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) . in conclusion , red disk - like galaxies at @xmath0 may not necessarily be dustier than nearby disk galaxies ( with @xmath19 ) and/or much older than @xmath5 1 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> this result is due both to a realistic description of dust attenuation and to the emission contribution by tp - agb stars , with ages of 0.2 to 12 gyr and intrinsically red colours .    </S>",
