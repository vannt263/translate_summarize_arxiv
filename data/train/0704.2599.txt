    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd suggests that the total widths of heavy quarkonium states should be calculable using perturbation theory .",
    "the earliest calculations of the widths of @xmath3-wave quarkonium states using perturbative qcd were plagued with infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "the calculations were based on a factorization assumption that the width could be expressed as the product of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the derivative of the radial wave function at the origin , and a perturbatively calculable coefficient .",
    "however the coefficients were found to be infrared divergent at leading order in @xmath6 for the spin-1 states and at next - to - leading order in @xmath6 for the spin-0 and spin-2 states .",
    "the infrared divergences were often expressed in terms of a logarithmic dependence on the binding energy of the quarkonium , a quantity that is not calculable using perturbation theory .",
    "however the correct interpretation of the infrared divergences is that they reveal the failure of the factorization assumption .",
    "this problem was overcome in 1992 when bodwin , braaten , and lepage showed that the infrared divergences could be absorbed into the probability for the heavy - quark - antiquark ( @xmath7 ) pair to be at the same point in a color - octet state @xcite .",
    "they used a nonrelativistic effective field theory for the @xmath7 sector of qcd called nrqcd to derive a general factorization formula for inclusive quarkonium decay rates @xcite .",
    "a @xmath3-wave multiplet consists of four heavy quarkonium states : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 with @xmath12 quantum numbers @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively . at leading order in the velocity @xmath17 of the heavy quark or antiquark in the quarkonium rest frame",
    ", there are only two independent nonperturbative factors in the annihilation decay rates of all four states in the @xmath3-wave multiplet : @xmath18 , which is proportional to @xmath4 , and @xmath19 , which is proportional to the probability for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be at the same point in a color - octet state .",
    "these nonperturbative factors can be expressed as matrix elements of local four - quark operators in nrqcd .",
    "the short - distance coefficients of the nrqcd matrix elements can be calculated as power series in the qcd coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "the widths of all four states in a @xmath3-wave multiplet can be calculated by using the nrqcd factorization formula , once the two nonperturbative factors @xmath22 and @xmath19 have been determined .",
    "these matrix elements can be calculated by using lattice simulations of nrqcd .",
    "an alternative is to estimate the color - singlet matrix element @xmath23 by using potential models and to determine the color - octet matrix element @xmath19 phenomenologically .",
    "the phenomenological determination of @xmath19 requires the measurement of an observable that is sensitive to this matrix element . in the case of bottomonium ,",
    "one such observable is the inclusive rate for charm production in decays of the spin - triplet @xmath3-wave states @xmath0 .",
    "this rate is sensitive to @xmath19 because the production of charm quarks from @xmath1 annihilation in the color - singlet channel is suppressed by a factor of @xmath6 , relative to production in the color - octet channel .",
    "there has been little previous work on open charm production in bottomonium decays . in 1978 , fritzsch and streng calculated the decay rate of @xmath24 into charm at leading order in @xmath6 @xcite . in 1979 , barbieri , caffo , and remiddi calculated the decay rates of the @xmath3-wave bottomonium states into charm at leading order in @xmath6 under the assumption that the rates could be expressed as products of @xmath4 and a perturbatively calculable coefficient @xcite . in the case of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the coefficients contained infrared divergences that were expressed in terms of logarithms of the binding energy .",
    "however , as we have mentioned , the correct interpretation of the infrared divergences is that they are contained in the probability to find the @xmath27 pair at a point in a color - octet state . by making use of the nrqcd factorization formalism",
    ", one can now carry out rigorous calculations of inclusive charm production from @xmath0 decays .",
    "in their 1979 paper , barbieri , caffo , and remiddi calculated the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath28 pair in @xmath0 decays . in order to make contact with experiment",
    ", one might be tempted to identify this distribution with the invariant mass distribution of pairs of charm hadrons .",
    "however that distribution can not be measured easily because the probability of identifying both charm hadrons is very low .",
    "furthermore , the effects of the hadronization of the charm quark into a charm hadron have a large effect on the distribution .",
    "these effects can not be calculated perturbatively , and they would also be very difficult to measure . a more useful quantity to calculate is the momentum distribution of the charm quark in @xmath0 decays .",
    "this can not be compared directly with the momentum distribution of the charm hadrons because of the effects of hadronization .",
    "however , the effects of hadronization can be determined experimentally by measuring the momentum distribution of charm hadrons in @xmath29 annihilation .    on the experimental side , the spin - triplet members of two multiplets of @xmath3-wave bottomonium states have been discovered : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the only properties of these states that have been measured thus far are their masses and their radiative branching fractions into the @xmath32-wave bottomonium states @xmath33 .",
