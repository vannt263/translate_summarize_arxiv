    "the precise alignment of the odcs with respect to the jet was determined by checking the consistency between tracks reconstructed by jet and hit points measured by odcs . in order to minimize the effect of multiple scattering in the detector material , we selected events whose rigidity was measured to be higher than 4  gv by jet and idcs .",

    "the change of the spectrum is less than 5  % for protons and helium nuclei below 1  tv , and for muons below 400  gv . the upward and downward triangles show the spectrum deformation when odcs are artificially displaced by @xmath32 m .",
