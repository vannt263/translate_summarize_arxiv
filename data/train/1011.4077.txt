    "bright granules containing hot ascending gas are observed separated by intergranular lanes of cool descending gas .",
    "the correlation between temperature and velocity fields , as well as the granule / intergranule contrast in velocity and intensity , shape the spectral features so that the line cores of disk - integrated profiles are shifted with respect to their rest wavelengths and the line profiles are asymmetric ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "three - dimensional model atmospheres for the sun , procyon , and k - dwarfs have been tested against high quality spectroscopic data @xcite , showing in general good agreement .",
    "these tests are crucial because they validate the models and allow us to use them with confidence to estimate the impact of `` 3d effects '' on stellar abundance and parameter determinations @xcite",
    ".    the most extreme abundance corrections proposed in connection with granulation effects occur at low metallicities .",
    "this is mainly because the difference between the 1d and 3d predictions for the mean temperature of the outer layers of metal - poor stars is very large , on the order of 1000k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this large temperature difference is very important for the formation of features that are temperature sensitive .",
    "for example , @xcite report 3d corrections of @xmath10dex ( i.e. , one order of magnitude ) for the abundance of nitrogen and oxygen as determined from molecular features , similar to the corrections required for the iron abundance determined from low excitation potential fei  lines .",
    "they also estimate a correction of about + 0.4dex for the iron abundance determined from feii  lines .",
    "we can only rely on the corrections suggested by 3d models if the hydrodynamic simulations are realistic",
    ". tests of the hydrodynamic simulations include measurements of the profiles of stellar absorption lines both with respect to shape and absolute wavelength . in this _ letter _ , we present new spectroscopic observations for the very metal - poor red giant star hd122563 and compare them to state - of - the - art 3d model predictions .",
    "we observed hd122563 on june 2125 , 2010 with the robert  g.  tull coud spectrograph on the 2.7 m harlan  j.  smith telescope at mcdonald observatory . using a narrow slit ( 0.34arcsec ) , the spectral resolution is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the wavelength coverage of a single exposure consists of 16 non - overlapping pieces of @xmath12  each . to increase wavelength coverage we rotated the spectrograph grating to three different positions ( setups ) . in this way we were able to cover about 70% of the 4425 to 5575  spectral window . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath13 ) , multiple 20-minute exposures of each setup ( from 8 to 16 , depending on the setup )",
    "were acquired .",
    "the total exposure time for all setups was about 10.5 hours .",
    "the @xmath13 of the coadded spectrum increases from about 180 at 4425  to 440 at 5575 , with a median @xmath14 .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced and coadded as in @xcite .",
    "the rms of the wavelength calibration for each exposure is about @xmath15  ( @xmath16ms@xmath4 ) .",
    "continuum normalization was done by fitting polynomials to the upper envelope of the data , first in the direction of dispersion and then perpendicular to it , as in @xcite .",
    "the barycentric correction was determined with a precision better than 1ms@xmath4  using a program by s.  els ( private communication ) .",
    "a radial velocity correction was applied to each setup by comparing the observed core wavelength shift versus line strength relation with the theoretical one ( cf .  sect .",

    "the uncertainty in this velocity is most likely due to instrumental and temperature / pressure instabilities ( the r.  g.  tull spectrograph is not in a vacuum ) .",
    "we identified 58 unblended fei  lines in our hd122563 spectrum .",

    "[ s : hydro ] ) by first resampling the spectral lines , using cubic spline interpolations , to iso - flux points on both wings of the lines .",
    "the midpoints of horizontal segments across the spectral line wings , which define the line bisector , were then computed .",
    "the wavelengths of observed spectral line cores were determined using the 7 data points closest to the flux minimum , which corresponds to a window of about 3.8  kms@xmath4 , and fitting a fourth order polynomial .",
    "core wavelength shifts ( hereafter given as a velocity , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the speed of light and @xmath24 ) were then derived using the adopted laboratory wavelengths .",

    "a number of tests were performed with a higher - resolution grid of @xmath32 points to ensure that this had no significant impact on the shapes of the synthetic line profiles .",
    "the synthetic 3d profiles were convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile of @xmath33  kms@xmath4 , which corresponds to the spectral resolution of our data . from a @xmath34 line profile fitting of about 30 fei  lines with the highest local @xmath13 , with @xmath35 and iron abundance as free parameters",

    "is low , the spectral lines are severely blended , or the granulation signatures are too weak ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ]",
    "the average difference in bisector velocities ( model minus observations for all 58 fei  lines ) is @xmath41ms@xmath4  ( hereafter , error bars correspond to the 1@xmath18 scatter ) .",
    "this number , however , depends on the relative flux .",
    "near the continuum , the bisector point - by - point difference is about @xmath42  ms@xmath4  while it is @xmath43  ms@xmath4  at a residual flux of about 0.2 . at all flux",
    "values the difference is consistent with zero within the @xmath44 scatter .",
    "the formal error in the observed bisector velocities shows a residual flux dependency remarkably similar to that described above ; i.e. , it ranges from about 30 to 150  ms@xmath4  from core to continuum .",
    "thus , the scatter seen in the differences between theoretical and observed bisectors is fully compatible with the @xmath44 observational errors .",
    "measurements of core wavelength shifts ( @xmath45 ) are in principle more precise than line bisectors , since only a small portion of the line profile is examined , thus lowering the probability of being affected by blends . in fig .",
    "[ f : shifts ] we show the relation between @xmath45 and line strength .",
    "the so - called `` third signature '' of stellar granulation @xcite , i.e. , the increased blueshift with decreasing line strength , is clearly detected in the data and very closely reproduced by the 3d model .",
    "the third signature is due to the fact that weaker lines form in deeper layers , where the granulation velocities and intensity contrast are larger .",
    "the line - to - line scatter seen in fig .",
    "[ f : shifts ] increases towards weaker lines , an effect that is present also in the 3d model predictions .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that this increased scatter is real , but given the timescale of the evolution of granules in comparison with the duration of the simulation and the possibility that line cores of weaker lines are more difficult to measure ( but see below ) , we must refrain from making a strong statement about this finding . note also that the variation of the continuous opacity over the wavelength range covered by our data is substantial , which introduces wavelength dependent shifts that might contribute to the observed scatter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the difference between observations and model predictions for @xmath45 has a 1@xmath18 scatter of 104ms@xmath4 .    to estimate the error in the measured @xmath45 values we artificially introduced gaussian noise to the theoretical profiles to simulate the local @xmath13 of the data .",
    "we took into account the variation of the @xmath13 across the line profile since it varies according to the amount of flux detected at each wavelength and it is therefore lower at the line core compared to the local continuum .",
    "this experiment was performed after degrading the theoretical profiles to the spectral resolution of our data and convolving it with a rotational profile with the @xmath35 we derived for hd122563 . finally , for each line tested we added in quadrature the error introduced by the uncertainty in the measured laboratory wavelengths ( 20ms@xmath4 ) and the estimated error of the wavelength calibration of the data ( 30ms@xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 values obtained from 1,000 of these tests , averaged over the 58 fei  lines , have a @xmath44 scatter of @xmath46  ms@xmath4 , nearly independent of line strength but mildly dependent on wavelength , reflecting the variation of the @xmath13 across our observed spectrum .",
    "this estimated observational error is very similar to the scatter seen in the comparison of model predictions and observations .",
    "we have observed the very metal - poor red giant star hd122563 , a primer for studies of the galactic stellar halo , at very high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the high quality of our data allowed us to measure the asymmetries and core wavelength shifts of a number of fei  lines , which clearly revealed the signatures of granulation .",
    "a state - of - the - art 3d lte radiative - hydrodynamic simulation was used to synthesize the same set of lines . using line profile fitting we derived a projected rotational velocity @xmath36  kms@xmath4 while the analysis of core wavelength shifts allowed us to infer an absolute radial velocity @xmath17  kms@xmath4 .",
    "the line bisectors and core wavelength shifts computed from the 3d model predictions agree with the observations of hd122563 remarkably well .",
    "the average difference between observations and model is consistent with zero within the estimated @xmath44 observational errors .",
    "this suggests that the 3d model contains realistic information regarding the atmospheric structure and velocity fields of hd122563 .",
    "abundance analyses of hd122563 using our 3d model show that standard 1d estimates of elemental abundances can be off by up to one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar results have been obtained with a simulation computed by an independent group @xcite , although their abundance corrections tend to be smaller .",
    "the large 3d corrections will have an impact on our interpretations of stellar abundance data for halo stars and may lead us to revise their connection with early enrichment of the galaxy , supernovae yields , and internal mixing processes .",
    "the observations presented in this _ letter _ and",
    "their comparison to the 3d model predictions suggest that such large 3d effects are reliable and must therefore be seriously considered in all studies of metal - poor stellar abundances .",
    "admittedly , the largest 3d corrections apply to abundances derived from molecular features whereas we have analyzed only fei  lines .",
    "the fei  lines provide one sampling of the atmospheric structure with a particular weighting over the different structures and velocity fields .",
    "other species , particularly the molecules , will provide different weighting and should in principle be investigated before claiming that the 3d models are adequately justified for all abundance analyses .",
    "unfortunately , in our spectral range the molecular lines are too weak for this type of work .",
    "we note , however , that our fei  lines form over a wide range of depths , spanning a large portion of the photosphere , including the regions of formation of molecular lines typically used in abundance work ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "both our 3d model and line synthesis assumed lte , yet the impact of departures from the lte approximation is likely to be very important at low metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to first order , however , non - lte affects the abundances but not the shapes of line profiles .",
