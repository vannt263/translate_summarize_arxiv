    "the mechanical model of a particle trapped in a nonlinear confining potential and subject to external noise has been widely studied to illustrate the interplay between randomness and nonlinearity in a classical dynamical system @xcite . because of the external noise ,",
    "some parameters of the system fluctuate with time and the equation of motion becomes a stochastic differential equation with multiplicative ( _ i.e. _ , parametric ) noise .",
    "models with multiplicative noise can undergo purely noise - induced phase transitions @xcite that can be realized experimentally , for example , in nonlinear electronic circuits @xcite or in systems with hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite .",
    "besides , the presence of multiplicative noise provides a microscopic model for the anomalous diffusion of a particle in a fluctuating field of force in the limit of vanishing damping rate @xcite .",
    "when the external randomness is represented by a gaussian white noise , many analytical results can be derived from the fokker - planck equation .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we have calculated the growth exponents and the associated generalized diffusion constants of a nonlinear oscillator with random frequency in the limit of vanishing damping rate .",
    "the key feature of the method is to derive an effective first order langevin equation for the action variable by averaging out the fast angular motion .",
    "the effective low dimensional problem can then be solved analytically . however",
    ", this method fails for colored noise .",
    "in fact , when the noise is colored , a new time scale , the coherence time of the noise , appears in the problem and straightforward averaging over the fast angular variable leads to erroneous results because correlation terms between the noise and the fast variable are eliminated .",
    "we could analyze only qualitatively @xcite through self - consistent scaling arguments the long time behavior of a nonlinear oscillator subject to colored parametric noise and found that it is radically different from that observed with white noise .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a consistent adiabatic averaging procedure that allows us to derive analytical results for the general nonlinear oscillator subject to an ornstein - uhlenbeck parametric noise .",
    "we calculate , in the long time limit , the probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) and derive explicit formulae for the mean values of physical observables such as the energy , the velocity - square , the amplitude - square .",
    "the method we describe here is a generalization of the averaging technique introduced in @xcite for the classical pendulum with fluctuating frequency .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model under study and review results that have been obtained in previous works  : we write the dynamical equation in terms of energy and angle coordinates and observe that a separation between fast and slow variables occurs in the long time limit .",
    "we then give the analytical expression of the p.d.f . and",
    "the scaling of physical observables in the white noise case . in section 3 ,",
    "we first recall the scaling behavior observed when the noise is colored and show explicitly that the standard averaging method fails in this case .",
    "we then develop an averaging method that allows us to deal with an ornstein - uhlenbeck noise .",
    "this technique is based on a recursive transformation of coordinates where the noise itself is treated as a dynamical variable .",
    "an effective langevin dynamics is derived for the slow variable that leads to an analytic expression for the p.d.f . and allows us to calculate the behavior of physical observables in the long time limit .",
    "our results are finally extended to include the effect of a small dissipation in the system .",
    "in this section , we review previously derived results that will be relevant for our present work .      we consider a nonlinear oscillator of amplitude @xmath0 , trapped in a confining potential @xmath1 and subject to a multiplicative noise @xmath2  : @xmath3 the statistical properties of the random function @xmath2 need",

    "we then elaborate an averaging scheme that allows us to derive the long time behavior of the nonlinear oscillator subject to multiplicative ornstein - uhlenbeck noise  : in subsection [ sec : transformation ] , we define a new set of variables on the three dimensional phase space @xmath48 that retains the relevant correlations between the noise and the fast angular variable . in subsections [ sec : averagingfp ] and",

    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of a nonlinear oscillator subject to a multiplicative ornstein - uhlenbeck noise is investigated . when the dynamics is expressed in terms of energy - angle coordinates </S>",
    "<S> , it is observed that the angle is a fast variable as compared to the energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an effective stochastic dynamics for the energy can be derived if the angular variable is averaged out . </S>",
    "<S> however , the standard elimination procedure , performed earlier for a gaussian white noise , fails when the noise is colored because of correlations between the noise and the fast angular variable . </S>",
    "<S> we develop here a specific averaging scheme that retains these correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to calculate the probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) of the system and to derive the behavior of physical observables in the long time limit . </S>"
