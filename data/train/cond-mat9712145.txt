    "therefore the measured jumps in the specific heat and in the entropy per molar volume , when plotted against the melting temperature , will be identical for the different angles .",
    "this prediction is fulfilled to within experimental error in recent measurements by schilling.@xcite    to understand this result in more detail , we now consider the results for the jumps ( [ eq : entjump ] ) and ( [ eq : cbcorr ] ) .",
    "notice that both of these results are of the form @xmath201 .",
    "the scaling rule ( [ eq : anis ] ) tells us that at fixed @xmath108 , the reduced variables @xmath41 and @xmath202 at melting are independent of @xmath186 .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the angular dependence of @xmath99 . in the isotropic system , @xmath203 . however , the three perpendicular dimensions of @xmath99 will scale differently with @xmath186 . if the field lies in the @xmath204-@xmath70 plane then @xmath205 , whereas the lengths in the plane of rotation scale as,@xcite @xmath206 therefore , at fixed temperature , but scaling the magnetic field as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmscal ] ) , we find that the volume per degree of freedom stays constant , @xmath207 so we see that it is because the volume per vortex degree of freedom is independent of @xmath186 at the melting field of a fixed temperature that @xmath208 and @xmath209 are also independent of @xmath186 .",
    "we now consider the case of fixing the magnetic field , and comparing the jumps at different melting temperatures as the angle of the field is rotated . in this case",
    ", the field scales to a _ different _",
    "value , @xmath210 , in the isotropic system for different values of @xmath186 .",
    "the melting temperature is , @xmath211 this equation differs from ( [ eq : hmscal ] ) in that we need to know the full melting curve in the isotropic case to find the angular dependence of the melting temperature .",
    "similarly , to determine the angular dependence of the entropy jump as a function of @xmath25 from ( [ eq : delsofttheta ] ) , we need to know the full function @xmath212 and the melting curve @xmath213 .",
    "however , in the case of no @xmath4 corrections we have an analytic form for the melting curve , @xmath214 , and in this limit we can find the angular scaling at the same values of @xmath25 .",
    "when we stay on the melting line at the same @xmath215 , the volume @xmath216 scales as @xmath217 if the jump in the entropy and the heat capacity were constant per vortex degree of freedom then this equation implies that the jumps would scale proportional to @xmath218 , as is stated in ref .  . however , we showed in section  [ sec : heat ] that the temperature dependence of @xmath38 gives a non - trivial temperature dependence to the jumps per vortex degree of freedom .",
    "in the limiting case of no @xmath4 corrections , the jump in entropy density is @xmath219 and the jump in heat capacity is @xmath220 .",
    "this leads to the angular scaling @xmath221 for the general case when @xmath4 corrections are included , there is no such simple form .",
    "however , the more general angular scaling of the jumps ( [ eq : delsofttheta ] ) still holds and it is straightforward to find @xmath222 and @xmath223 numerically .",
    "we have not in this paper considered the case of the strongly layered high-@xmath44 superconductors such as biscco , where the low melting field @xmath224 means that the scaling form of ( [ eq : scaling ] ) does not apply .",
    "still , in ref .  , we successfully determined the magnetization jump in biscco using dimensional estimates , together with a lindemann analysis of the melting line .",
    "the reason this works , while simple estimates for the entropy jump do not , is that the induction is a derivative of the gibbs free energy with respect to @xmath25 ( rather than @xmath108 as for the entropy ) and the @xmath25 dependence of the vortex parameters is much weaker than the @xmath108 dependence .",
    "the entropy jump for biscco could then be found by combining our result for @xmath106 with the melting line and the clausius",
    " clapeyron relation ( [ eq : cc ] ) .",
    "it is not possible to simply follow this procedure to find @xmath0 using the relation ( [ eq : cc3 ] ) , as the simple estimates will be incorrect for @xmath146 .",
    "it is also interesting to consider whether the conditions for the calorimetric jumps to be the same in a constant @xmath14 system and in a constant @xmath25 system , derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : mag ] , hold at these low fields .",
    "the melting field in biscco is of the order of the bulk lower critical field @xmath135 , which is also the size of the magnetization : @xmath225 . therefore the slopes @xmath226 and @xmath227 will be of a similar size so that the condition ( [ eq : conddelb ] ) is not fulfilled and the rhs of ( [ eq : again ] ) is not small .",
    "in experimental measurements on biscco ( at constant @xmath25 ) there will be a significant contribution to the entropy and specific heat jumps that is not present in a system of fixed flux density @xmath14 .    to summarize",
    ", we have calculated the specific heat jump at the melting transition of the vortex lattice for ybco , using the scaling form of the london model at high fields and numerical results from recent simulations .",
    "we find a jump with the same magnitude as the measured experimental values .",
    "we have used analogous relations to the clausius ",
    "clapeyron equation to find the jumps in the magnetization slopes , and these are also consistent with measured values for ybco .",
    "a careful analysis was made to make sure that the jumps in the entropy and in the specific heat are the same for a system at constant @xmath14 and at constant @xmath25 .",
    "we have constructed the relevant conditions and have verified that they are satisfied at the vortex  lattice melting line in ybco .",
    "we have analyzed the changes to the jumps when the field angle is rotated with respect to the crystal and thereby explain the recently measured angular scaling of the entropy and specific heat jumps in ybco.@xcite in conclusion , we find that the london model with temperature and field dependent parameters gives a consistent picture of the first  order transition observed in ybco.@xcite                                        e.h .",
