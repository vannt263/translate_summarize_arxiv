    "integral - field - unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy is a very powerful technique , allowing complex processes , both physical , chemical and kinematic , be probed with the same angular resolution as with conventional imaging data . as well as the ability to take spectra of contiguous areas ,",
    "the now well - known advantages of ifu spectroscopy also include the elimination of slit losses and the relative ease of target acquisition . in the near - infrared , it is key to understanding the distribution , excitation and kinematics of gas and/or stars in objects ranging from obscured protostellar complexes to morphologically peculiar high - redshift galaxies .",
    "since many important advances will come from the study of statistical samples of faint astrophysical objects , simultaneous integral - field spectroscopy of several sources in a single field will greatly increase the efficient use of the precious vlt resource .",
    "the 2k @xmath4 2k pixels available in foreseeable infrared arrays means that fully covering the focal plane of an 8m - class telescope with an ifu capable of fine spatial sampling will remain impracticable for many years . to allow high - spatial - resolution integral - field spectroscopy of several targets within a field ,",
    "we therefore need the ability to position a number of small - field ifus anywhere within a larger patrol field , a non - trivial task .",
    "the capability to work at wavelengths longer than 1.7@xmath1 m , where thermal emission dominates the background , is crucial .",
    "for example , the study of h@xmath7 emission in galaxies at @xmath8 , or using co , hei and heii lines to probe heavily obscured proto - stars all require integral - field spectroscopy with @xmath9@xmath1 m .",
    "the challenges of cryogenically cooling the optics and the deployment mechanism therefore have to be solved .",
    "we have developed a concept for a modular instrument with deployable optics to position 32 ifu fields over a 10@xmath0 field .",
    "we summarise the science drivers to estimate the required number of ifu fields and present strawman functional requirements for the instrument .",
    "finally , we then describe the results of our design study .",
    "extremely deep optical and infrared surveys  the hubble deep fields ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) and their ilk  are revolutionising the study of galaxy evolution by providing large samples of galaxies at a range of redshifts for which detailed comparison of the distribution , excitation and kinematics of the gas and stars with nearby analogues may be made .",
    "radio , x - ray and submm surveys ( using scuba , mambo , vla , _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ , and future missions such as blast , _ sirtf _ and _ herschel _ ) are providing large , complementary samples of x - ray- and radio - loud agn and distant starbursts , many severely obscured by dust ( e.g.  smail et al .  1997 ; richards 2000 ) .",

    "eros with @xmath15 , some associated with the scuba galaxies , are circled . ]",
    "one of the defining characteristics of highly - obscured agn and star - forming galaxies is their red colours in the rest - frame optical and near - infrared . by their very nature",
    "these galaxies are difficult to identify in optical surveys",
    ". a few examples of such extremely red objects ( eros  hu & ridgway 1994 ) turned up through deep near - infrared surveys , but these were viewed as little more than curiosities .",
    "a number of recent developments have forced a reassessment of this situation and it now appears that highly - obscured sources may host power sources which dominate the extragalactic background light in the hard x - ray and submm bands ( smail et al .",
    "1999 ) . under half of the ero population has been identified with obscured starbursts , the rest with massive elliptical galaxies at @xmath16 12 whose red colours arise from their evolved stellar populations .",
    "the long - term goals of these studies are to constrain the early formation of massive galaxies at high redshifts and to derive the relative histories of obscured star formation and accretion activity to test models of galaxy and black hole evolution .",
    "knowledge of the redshift distribution is crucial ",
    "@xmath17 breaks degeneracies in the models and allows the mass and luminosity of the sources to be explored , e.g.  via observations of co. near - infrared ifu spectroscopy can also provide extinction estimates , independent star - formation rates , and probe for signs of agn activity ( e.g.  broad h@xmath7 emission , ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) .    at @xmath18",
    "the surface density of @xmath15 eros is @xmath2360degree@xmath13 , and so we immediately see the benefit of spectroscopic multiplexing .",
    "the surface density of submm galaxies above 2mjy at 850@xmath1 m is @xmath19degree@xmath13 with at least half expected to be associated with eros . a multiplexing factor of @xmath230 may thus be appropriate to take advantage of upcoming surveys .",
    "it is difficult , however , to predict this factor precisely , which is an excellent reason to build a modular instrument (  3.3 ) .",
    "studies of galaxy evolution ultimately require full two - dimensional spectroscopy in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath6 bands for meaningful samples of sources , to cover the key rest - frame optical diagnostic lines at @xmath22",
    ". virtually all galaxies are spatially resolved in the best vlt @xmath6-band seeing , and many will have complex morphologies  the result of interactions and mergers for the obscured systems , the result of rotation for some of the field galaxy population .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy will be essential to determine their detailed internal properties .",
    "other obvious astrophysical applications for near - infrared multiple - ifu spectroscopy include investigating the build - up of spiral disks , exploiting gravitational amplification of distant galaxies by foreground cluster lenses probing and investigating young globulars in starburst galaxies .",

    "< , < \" , ]     [ tab1a ]    our instrument concept can provide a maximum number of pick - offs of about 32 . to use all 32 pick - offs , the mean surface density of randomly - distributed sources needs to be 0.52arcmin@xmath13 for a patrol field of 510arcmin , i.e.  about 40 per field .",
    "this is because the pick - off mechanism inevitably vignettes a small fraction of the field . from table  1",
    "it is obvious that about 30 deployable ifus are needed for the science  there is no strong case for hundreds of simultaneous measurements , and too few ifus would not provide optimum efficiency .",
    "based on the science drivers , we concluded that the instrument should have the following capabilities :    * 12.5@xmath1 m  coverage , fully cryogenic for good @xmath6-band performance ; * patrol field of 510arcmin diameter ; * approximately 30 individual deployable fields ; * spatial sampling in the ifus should be 0.2arcsecpixel@xmath5 to capitalise on the best seeing conditions at @xmath6 ; * field of an ifu should be around 4 @xmath4 4arcsec so that for most sources some sky area is included ; * a spectral resolution of @xmath23 3000 to work effectively between oh lines ; * 2k @xmath4 2k detectors were assumed , with up to 8 needed for a full set of 32 deployable units ; * the deployment mechanism must be capable of positioning an ifu to within 1/5 of an ifu field . since the field of the ifu and the size of the array mean that there is no cross dispersion , if accurate relative astrometry is needed across the full spectral range then the @xmath24 spectra must be obtained before reconfiguring the field .",
    "there are two basic approaches to deploying reflective image slicers  physically move them in the focal plane , or tilt / move a pick - off mirror to direct the desired field into a fixed image slicer . moving",
    "the ifu means that the position of the spectra on the detector will vary depending on the position of the ifu in the field , and the design of a cryogenic mechanism which does not obstruct the moving modules is very difficult .",
    "a simpler method is to use a pick - off mirror system to steer the desired field area into a fixed array of image slicers .",
    "this also has the advantage of producing a fixed spectrum on the detector(s ) .",
    "additional goals for the design of the pick - off mechanism were to use proven technologies , stepper motors and gears for the moving parts , and so a small pick - off mirror is preferred to a heavier image slicer .",
    "an articulated arm carries relay optics to feed small portions of the focal plane to each ifu which are at fixed locations in the instrument . the focal plane ( where the pick - offs move )",
    "should ideally be flat to remove the need for a focus mechanism for each and every pick - off .",
    "it is also telecentric , which avoids pupil motion dependent on field position .",
    "field correction is achieved by lenses that form the cryostat window .",
    "the principle of operation of the pick - off arm concept is shown in figure  2 .",
    "a potential difficulty of using steerable mirrors  the need to compensate for changes in the optical path length between the focal plane and the spectrograph  is avoided because a collimated beam is passed around the elbow and shoulder and so no other mechanisms are required .",
    "although simple in theory , the articulated arm has a number of complexities in its engineering : it must be light and stiff , compact and protected against control failure .",
    "the end result , shown in figure  3 , is therefore quite complex .",
    "both the necessary rotations are produced by stepping motors which drive worm and wheel mechanisms . in the event of a malfunction in the control chain ,",
    "a stopwork prevents the shoulder from turning more than @xmath2555@xmath26 by stalling the motor .",
    "the elbow rotation has two stages of gear reduction  an initial worm and wheel identical to ( and concentric with ) the shoulder drive , followed by a gear and sector reduction to give a fine motion to the prism at the far end of the main arm .",
    "an additional benefit is that the weight of the elbow drive motor is not carried by the shoulder bearings or any of the moving support structures .",
    "this layout does mean , however , that a rotation of the shoulder induces a rotation of the elbow . to keep the main arm parallel to its original orientation as the shoulder moves",
    ", both shoulder and elbow drives must operate .",
    "if the elbow drive fails for any reason , it must be possible to drive the shoulder ( if only to retract the arm from the field of view ) without damaging the elbow joint .",
    "consequently , the main arm is mounted so that it is driven positively in one direction but via a spring in the other direction .",
    "this gives the freedom to deal with such a failure of the elbow motor , or a clash between an arm and its neighbours .",
    "a stopwork similar to that on the shoulder drive prevents excessive rotation of the elbow .          rather than building a single large spectrograph ,",
    "the instrument is instead designed to be highly modular with a number of identical spectrographs each fed by only a small number of ifus .",
    "there are several variations possible , ranging from 1 ifu  1 spectrograph  1 array to 4 ifus  1 spectrograph  1 array .",
    "the selection of one these options will ultimately depend on the number of arrays available and a more detailed science trade - off between the ifu fields and number of spectral elements .",
    "since much of the mass and space envelope for the instrument is occupied by the ifu deployment mechanisms , the spectrograph modules must be compact and simple .",
    "the maxiumum number of pick - off fields of view is provided by the solution in which 4 integral fields feed 1 spectrograph , as shown in figure  4 .",
    "small image slicers such as those described in content et al .",
    "1997 or wells et al.2000 are packaged in groups of four to provide a compact unit at the end of the feed arms an optical design has been developed for a compact 2 mirror plus 1 grating spectrograph that has 2 slits at the entrance aperture .",
    "each slit is covers 2k pixels and is formed by two of the four image slicers ; the spectra cover 1k pixels .",
    "if only half the arms are used , it would be possible in principal to obtain spectra covering 2k pixels .      to provide 32 simultaneously addressable integral fields of 4@xmath3 @xmath4 4@xmath3 covering a total 10-arcmin field ,",
    "the instrument consists of 8 unit spectrographs , as described above , each of which has 4 movable arms and 4 image slicers .",
    "the overall dimensions of the instrument are 1.5 m diameter and 2.5 m long for the packaging shown in figure  5 .",
    "the mass of all the cold hardware is 700 kg , and the total instrument mass will be about 2tonnes , including cryostat , electronics , etc .",
    "this very modular concept allows considerable freedom in the detailed design .",
    "for example , it would be possible for one of the unit spectrographs to have a different spectral resolution , or to dedicate some arms to @xmath6-only spectroscopy and others exclusively to @xmath20 .",
    "equally important , the modular design would enable a modular development of the whole instrument . to build and test one unit spectrograph with 4 deployable fields",
    "is not a very big engineering step from existing cryogenic ir spectrographs .",
    "this unit could , of course , be used for science while the others were being built .",
    "the instrument concept described here was based on design studies carried out at the uk atc and the university of durham .",
