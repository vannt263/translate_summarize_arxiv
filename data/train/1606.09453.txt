    "in previous work we studied the singularity structure of a braneworld model consisting of a flat @xmath0-brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk space filled with an analogue of a perfect fluid ( the fifth coordinate @xmath1 playing the role of time ) .",
    "the perfect fluid satisfied a linear equation of state with a constant parameter @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ` pressure ' and @xmath5 is the ` density ' . in @xcite",
    "we showed that for a flat brane there exist singularities that appear within finite distance @xmath6 from the position of the brane supposedly located at the origin , for all values of @xmath2 . a way to avoid such singularities",
    "is to exploit the natural @xmath7 symmetry introduced by the existence of the brane by cutting the bulk space and considering a slice of it which is free from finite - distance singularities .",
    "although this matching mechanism is possible for all values of @xmath2 , the requirement for localised gravity on the brane restricts @xmath2 in the interval @xmath8 . on the other hand , further requirements for physical conditions , such as energy conditions ,",
    "restrict @xmath2 in values greater than @xmath9 .",
    "therefore within the framework of our flat brane model it is not possible to satisfy at the same time the positive energy conditions and the condition for localised gravity on the brane .",
    "a question that naturally arises is whether any of the above conclusions about the existence of singularities are sensitive to the geometry of the brane so that singularities are absent when we consider a curved brane . it was proposed in  @xcite , @xcite that the singularity present in the flat brane model moves to infinite distance when the brane becomes curved , such as de sitter ( ds ) or anti - de sitter ( ads ) in the maximally symmetric case , which was in accordance with previous claims made in @xcite . in this paper , we show that this is indeed possible . in particular , we show that for curved branes there exist ranges of @xmath2 for which finite - distance singularities are avoided ; these are : @xmath10 ( for positively curved brane ) and @xmath11 ( for negatively curved brane ) . for each type of brane geometry and values of @xmath2 outside these regions",
    ", we find that finite - distance singularities continue to exist .",
    "a way to be removed is by using the cutting and matching procedure mentioned above to construct a slice of non - singular bulk space , when that is possible .",
    "moreover , imposing the null energy condition ( guaranteeing the absence of ghosts in the bulk ) excludes de sitter ( ds ) branes and one is left only with the second region of @xmath2 for anti - de sitter ( ads ) branes .",
    "however , we further show that this region in ads branes is incompatible with having also localised gravity on the brane .",
    "the situation is not improved when allowed non - singular solutions obtained by the cutting and matching procedure .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in sections @xmath12 and @xmath0 , we present the model and give the exact solutions respecting 4d maximal symmetry , as well as the complete list of all asymptotic behaviours for all ranges of the parameters in our model . in section @xmath13 ,",
    "we analyse in detail the two non - singular solutions found in section @xmath0 . in section @xmath14",
    ", we derive the null energy condition and investigate its consequences . in section @xmath15",
    "we construct non - singular orbifold - like solutions , called matching in the following , obtained by the cutting and matching procedure for those cases that allow it , and study the null energy condition . in section @xmath16",
    ", we examine whether the previously derived solutions also satisfy the condition for localisation of gravity on the brane .",
    "section @xmath17 contains a summary of our results and some concluding remarks . finally , in appendix",
    "a we derive the solutions found for two special values of the parameter @xmath2 that can not be incorporated in the solutions given in section @xmath0 .",
    "our braneworld model consists of a 3-brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk space @xmath18 filled with an analogue of a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath19 , where the ` pressure ' @xmath4 and the ` density ' @xmath5 are functions only of the fifth dimension , @xmath1 .",
    "the bulk metric is of the form [ warpmetric ] g_5=a^2(y)g_4+dy^2 , where @xmath20 is the four - dimensional de sitter or anti de sitter metric , _",
    "i.e. _ , [ branemetrics ] g_4=-dt^2+f^2_kg_3 , with [ g_3 ] g_3=dr^2+h^2_kg_2 , and [ g_2 ] g_2=d^2+^2d^2 , where @xmath21 or @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the de sitter ( or ads ) curvature radius ) and @xmath24 or @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the metric ( [ warpmetric ] ) is a warped product on @xmath26 the warping factor being positive @xmath27 , it may be considered as a generalization of the standard riemannian cone metric @xmath28 on @xmath26 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the bulk fluid has an energy - momentum tensor of the form [ t old ] t_ab=(+p)u_au_b - pg_ab , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with the 5th coordinate corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein equations , g_ab=^2_5t_ab , can be written in the following form : [ syst2i ] & = & -2 a , + [ syst2iii ] & = & + , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the prime @xmath33 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath1 . the equation of conservation , _ bt^ab=0 , becomes [ syst2ii ] +4(1+)=0 .",
    "integration of the continuity equation ( [ syst2ii ] ) gives the following relation between the density and the warp factor , [ rho to a ] = c_1 a^-4(+1 ) , where @xmath34 is an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "substitution of eq .",
    "( [ rho to a ] ) in eq .",

    "c_1a^-2(2 + 1)+kh^2 , and after setting @xmath35 ( note the the sign of @xmath36 is the same with the sign of @xmath5 ) , we have the friedman constraint in the form , [ integration eq ] a^2=ca^-2(2 + 1)+kh^2 .",
    "the left hand side of this equation restricts the signs of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as well as the range of @xmath38 . as a result ,",
    "the case @xmath39 and @xmath40 becomes automatically impossible .",
    "on the other hand , the case @xmath39 , @xmath41 is possible only for , @xmath42 while , the case @xmath43 , @xmath40 is possible only for @xmath44 it is straightforward to see that these two cases offer the possibility for avoidance of singularities .",
    "more generally , our solutions below are characterised by these three constants , namely , the curvature constant @xmath37 , the fluid constant @xmath2 , and the constant @xmath36 , where as mentioned above the sign of @xmath36 controls that of the density @xmath5 .",
    "the case @xmath39 , @xmath41 of a ds brane with @xmath10 , implies that @xmath45 , so that the warp factor , @xmath38 , is bounded away from zero , excluding therefore collapse singularities from happening .",
    "the only way that this case may introduce a finite - distance singularity is to have a warp factor that becomes divergent within a finite distance ( big - rip singularity ) .",
    "however , it will follow from our analysis in the next section that this behaviour is also excluded and therefore this case does indeed lead to the avoidance of finite - distance singularities . on the other hand , the case @xmath43 , @xmath40 of an ads brane with @xmath46 , implies that the warp factor takes only values greater than @xmath47 , thus excluding the existence of collapse singularities , as well .",
    "as we will show later on , this latter case requires a further restriction on @xmath2 , @xmath11 , in order to avoid a finite - distance big - rip singularity .",
    ". ( [ integration eq ] ) can be integrated out to give a solution represented by the gaussian hypergeometric function @xmath48 , for all possible cases defined by the signs of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the range of @xmath2 . ) , @xcite . ] these solutions along with the asymptotic behaviours they introduce are presented in what follows .",
    "the values @xmath49 and @xmath50 are special values for our system of equations ( [ syst2i ] ) , ( [ syst2iii ] ) and ( [ syst2ii ] ) in the sense that they reduce it to a significantly simpler form which leads to solutions that can not be incorporated into the solutions found below with the use of the gaussian hypergeometric function .",
    "the solutions for these values of @xmath2 are studied separately in appendix a , however , in order to have a complete view of the asymptotics for all possible values of @xmath2 immediately , we present the behaviors of the solutions for @xmath51 in the subsections 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 that follow .      we begin our study with the case of a ds braneworld with positive density .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath43 , @xmath41 , and depending on the range of @xmath2 we have the following sub - cases :    * for @xmath46 , the solution is , [ sol type ia ] ( y - y_0)=_2f_1(,- , , -a^-2(2 + 1 ) ) . * for @xmath10",

    "there are two types of finite - distance singularities : a collapse singularity located at @xmath6 , _ and _ a big - rip singularity located at @xmath64 .",
    "as we will show later , the coexistence of these two types of singularity not only does not lead to non - singular spacetimes , but it also impedes the construction of any non - singular matching solution for @xmath60 .    on the other hand , for @xmath65 , the braneworld suffers only from a finite - distance singularity of the collapse type , which allows for the construction of a matching non - singular solution .",
    "we now consider a ds braneworld with negative density , corresponding to @xmath39 , @xmath41 , and let @xmath2 varying as follows :    * @xmath46 , the solution is given by ( [ sol type ia ] ) .",

    "the last possible case is that of an open universe with positive density support on the bulk which translates to considering @xmath43 and @xmath40 ( ads braneworld ) .",

    "as we mentioned earlier , this case is subject to the bound ( [ bound ads ] ) the possible asymptotic behaviours for this case are then as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath52 we find @xmath53 , as @xmath54 , which implies a collapse singularity at @xmath6 ; the warp factor is bounded from above .",
    "2 .   @xmath66 we find @xmath59 as @xmath56 , so that this region of @xmath2 is free form finite distance singularities , since @xmath38 is again bounded from below and never vanishes .",

    "this is a big - rip singularity located at @xmath6 .",
    "there is no collapse singularity since @xmath38 is bounded from below .",
    "we saw in the previous section that there are solutions free from finite - distance singularities in the following cases :    * ds brane with negative density and @xmath67 * ads brane with positive density and @xmath66 .    in this section",
    "we analyse the complete character of these two non - singular solutions .",
    "the first non - singular solution is given by eq .",
    "( [ sol type iib ] ) for @xmath10 .",
    "the two branches of this solution may be matched in the following way .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the value of @xmath1 for which @xmath69 is equal to @xmath70 , that is [ a hat ] ( a())^-2(2 + 1)=- .",
    "then we see from eq .",
    "( [ sol type iib ] ) that the value of the gaussian hypergeometric function at @xmath68 is equal to one , while from the left - hand side of the same equation we find that @xmath71 .",
    "we note that @xmath6 is a regular point of the solution .",
    "putting eq .",
    "( [ a hat ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ integration eq ] ) we find that a(y_0)=0 , so that @xmath6 is a critical point .",
    "we now check the second derivative of @xmath38 , @xmath72 . for @xmath39",

    "( [ rho to a ] ) and the fact that @xmath73 that also @xmath74 . further assuming @xmath10",
    ", we find from eq  ( [ syst2i ] ) that a(y_0)>0 .",
    "thus , for this choice of parameters we see that at @xmath6 the warp factor takes its minimum value and then it starts to increase , avoiding in this way collapse singularities .    to study the behaviour of the solution at infinity i.e. as @xmath59 , we expand the hypergeometric function as follows @xcite , & & _ 2f_1 ( , , , 1+a^2(2 + 1))= _",

    "the behaviour of @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "[ non singular solution ] .",
    "+    for an ads braneworld on the other hand , the solution ( [ sol type iiib ] ) is non - singular for @xmath11 .",
    "we note that because of eq .",
    "( [ bound ads ] ) , the warp factor @xmath38 for this range of @xmath2 can not approach zero and therefore all collapse singularities are excluded from happening , however , the possibility of the warp factor becoming _ divergent _ within finite distance is not a priori prohibited .",
    "if such behaviour is encountered then we end up with an even stronger type of singularity , a big rip .",
    "let us suppose that the warp factor does become divergent , @xmath55 , but restrict @xmath2 in the interval @xmath76 .",
    "the hypergeometric function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ sol type iiib ] ) has the argument @xmath77 which is diverging so to study its behaviour at infinity , we first expand it in the following way , & & _ 2f_1 ( , , , 1+a^-2(2 + 1))= + & & _ 3(-1-a^-2(2 + 1))^- + & & _ 2f_1 ( , , , ( 1+a^-2(2 + 1))^-1)+ + & & + _ 4(-1-a^-2(2 + 1))^-1/2 _ 2f_1(,0 , , ( 1+a^-2(2 + 1))^-1 ) , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the constants , _",
    "4=. substituting the above expression of the hypergeometric function in the solution ( [ sol type iiib ] ) , we deduce the asymptotic behaviour , [ asyminfty ] ( y - y_0)~a^2(+1 ) , so that for @xmath59 , we get @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the divergence of the warp factor is only possible at infinite distance which means that finite - distance big rip singularities are excluded .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath38 is similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ non singular solution ] .",
    "in this section we study the null energy condition for our type of matter ( [ t old ] ) and then examine for which ranges of @xmath2 it holds true .",
    "we note that our metric ( [ warpmetric ] ) and our fluid are static with respect to the time coordinate @xmath80 .",
    "we may reinterpret our fluid analogue as a real anisotropic fluid having the following energy momentum tensor : [ t new ] t_ab= ( ^0 + p^0)u_a^0u_b^0 + p^0g__a^_b^+ p_yg_55_a^5_b^5 , where @xmath81 , @xmath29 and @xmath82 .",
    "when we combine ( [ t old ] ) with ( [ t new ] ) , we get the following set of relations , [ p y to rho ] p_y&= & + [ rho new ] ^0&=&p + [ p new ] p^0&=&-p .",
    "the last two relations imply that [ p new to rho new ] p^0=-^0 , which means that this type of matter satisfies a cosmological constant - like equation of state . imposing further @xmath83 , and using ( [ p y to rho ] ) , leads to , [ py to p ] p_y=. substituting ( [ p new ] ) , ( [ p new to rho new ] ) and ( [ py to p ] ) in ( [ t new ] ) , we find that t_ab= -p g__a^_b^+ g_55_a^5_b^5 .",
    "we are now ready to form the null energy condition for our type of matter . according to the null energy condition",
    ", every future - directed null vector @xmath84 should satisfy @xcite t_abk^ak^b0 .",
    "this condition implies that the energy density should be non - negative . here",
    "we find that it translates to p+0 , or , in terms of @xmath5 ( + 1)0 , which leads to two possible cases , namely , 0 -1,0 -1 . with the use of ( [ rho to a ] ) , in which @xmath85 , these two conditions may be written equivalently with respect to @xmath36 instead of @xmath5 as , [ nec_c_1 ] c0 -1 , and [ nec_c_2 ] c0 -1 .",
    "the conditions ( [ nec_c_1 ] ) and ( [ nec_c_2 ] ) show that the requirement of satisfying the null energy condition leads to restrictions on both the range of @xmath2 and the sign of the constant @xmath36 .",
    "we conclude that the only range for @xmath36 and @xmath2 that is compatible with a non - singular solution , and at the same time also satisfies the null energy condition , is @xmath43 and @xmath11 combined with @xmath40 , that is ads braneworld with positive density and @xmath86 . in particular , ds non - singular braneworlds are incompatible with the null energy condition holding in the bulk .",
    "in this section we will examine those solutions from the sections 3.1 - 3.3 , that allow a jump in the derivative of the warp factor , @xmath87 , across the brane , and also satisfy the null energy condition .",

    "big - rip singularities are also excluded . assuming a continuous warp factor at the position of the brane @xmath95",

    "note that @xmath97 are both positive from ( [ matching sol 1 ] ) which is compatible with our choice of sign for @xmath96 . further imposing continuity of @xmath5 at @xmath95",
    ", we find from ( [ rho to a ] ) and @xmath85 that [ match_2 ] c^+=c^- .",
    "next , we take into account the jump of the derivative of the warp factor across the brane . for our type of geometry",

    "[ matching one solution ]   +    we can also have a matching solution by cutting the regular solutions @xmath100 , or , @xmath101 at a point different from the minimum ( cutting the regular solutions at the minimum would lead to a vanishing brane tension ) .",

    "the brane tension , however , now reads f((0))=-12 , and we note that it is again negative .    the rest of the cases @xmath103 and @xmath104 that satisfy the null energy condition for @xmath60 ( @xmath105 ) and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) , respectively , are not suitable for constructing non - singular matching solutions since they exhibit either two collapse ( case @xmath107 ) , or two big rip singularities ( case @xmath108 ) that restrict @xmath1 to take values only between the interval with endpoints the two finite singularities .",
    "that means that the resulting matching solutions can not be extended to the whole real line of @xmath1 .",
    "another question we would like to answer is whether the non - singular solutions we have found for the warp factor @xmath38 , satisfying the null energy condition , lead to a finite four - dimensional planck mass , thus localising 4d gravity on the brane for some range of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the value of the four - dimensional planck mass , @xmath109 , is determined by the following integral @xcite , = _",

    "in this paper , we have analysed braneworld singularities in the presence of ds or ads branes and found one non - singular solution for a ds brane with negative ( bulk ) density and another one for an ads brane with positive ( bulk ) density , for particular ranges of the parameter space , that we constructed explicitly .",

    "the first balance described the behavior of @xmath38 around a finite collapse singularity , while the second balance described the behavior of @xmath38 at infinity .",
    "in particular , the balance @xmath114 gave the behavior , @xmath59 as @xmath56 , however , this case is characterised as singular because of the finite - distance singularity of collapse type introduced by the balance @xmath113 .",
    "on the other hand , the case of an ads brane with positive density , described in section 3.2 , was depicted by the balance @xmath114 which is non - singular for @xmath10 .",
    "the balance @xmath113 which leads to finite - distance singularities for flat and positively curved branes is not valid in this case since it assumes only positive density , whereas , this case is characterised by a negative density .",
    "lastly , the third case , described in section 3.3 , can be described by the balance @xmath113 which allows for a non - singular solution for @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible that non - singular solutions that satisfy the null energy condition in the bulk and at the same time localize gravity in the braneworld exist for models of interacting matter as in @xcite , or , for homogeneous but anisotropic ( eg .",
