    "in the mixed state , the magnetization of superconductors is a combination of two different contributions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 is the equilibrium ( or reversible ) magnetization@xcite and @xmath7 is the irreversible magnetization .",
    "the former is caused by the equilibrium surface current .",
    "the latter arises from the surface ( bean - livingston ) barrier effect,@xcite as well as the bulk pinning due to the interaction between vortices and various defects within the superconductor .",
    "the surface barrier originates from the competition between two forces , ( a ) an attractive interaction between a vortex and its image vortex and ( b ) a repulsive interaction between a vortex and the surface shielding current . for high-@xmath8 cuprate superconductors , the irreversible magnetization at low temperatures",
    "is dominated by the bulk pinning .",
    "however , the role of the surface barrier effect becomes significant as the temperature increases.@xcite    recently , superconductivity in a non - cuprate binary compound mgb@xmath9 was discovered by akimitsu _",
    "et al._@xcite this material is known to be type ii superconductor with the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath10 26 and @xmath11 40 k,@xcite and various experimental studies@xcite have been carried out to elucidate the fundamental properties of this new superconductor .    in the mixed state ,",
    "the magnetic behavior of mgb@xmath9 has been known to resemble that of the conventional superconductors such as nb - ti and nbsn@xmath12 .",
    "et al_.@xcite showed that the parameter @xmath13 is linear in @xmath14 over a wide range of temperature as in nb@xmath12sn , where the @xmath15 is the magnetic hysteresis in @xmath2 .",
    "they also reported the proportionality of the irreversible field @xmath16 and the upper - critical field @xmath17 , which are usually independent in high-@xmath8 cuprates .    in this work , we measured magnetization @xmath2 of mgb@xmath9 superconductor as a function of the external magnetic field to elucidate its pinning properties in detail .",
    "we found that the @xmath2 curves for various temperatures can be describe by the exponential critical state model.@xcite from this analysis , we present evidence of the significant role of bulk pinning in this system even up to @xmath18 , which is contrary to the case of high-@xmath8 cuprates .",
    "a commercially available powder of mgb@xmath0 ( alfa aesar)@xcite was used to make a pellet .",
    "high - pressure heat treatment was performed with a 12-mm cubic multi - anvil press.@xcite the pellet was put into a au capsule in a high - pressure cell . a _",
    "d_-type thermocouple was inserted near the au capsule to monitor the temperature .",
    "it took about 2 hours to pressurize the cell to 3 gpa .",
    "after the pressurization , the heating power was increased linearly and then maintained constant for 2 hours .",
    "the sample was sintered at a temperature of @xmath19c and then quenched to room temperature .",
    "the sample weighed about 130 mg and was about 4.5 mm in diameter and 3.3 mm in height .",
    "the magnetization curves were measured by using a squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms-_xl _ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the temperature dependence of the zero - field - cooled magnetization measured at @xmath20 oe . from this figure",
    ", we found that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 and the transition width @xmath21 were about 37 k and 1 k , respectively.@xcite    figure  [ fig2 ] shows the magnetization curves , @xmath2 , of mgb@xmath9 , which were measured in the temperature region of 5 k @xmath22 33 k.@xcite one notable feature is the symmetry in the increasing and the decreasing field branches , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the magnetizations in the increasing and the decreasing field branches , respectively .",
    "such a feature can be commonly found in previous reports.@xcite this means that the contribution of the equilibrium magnetization and the surface pinning is negligible compared to that of the bulk pinning .",
    "the irreversible magnetization can be described by various critical - state models .",
    "the bean model@xcite has been used to calculate the critical current density of superconducting materials .",
    "the model assumes that the slope @xmath26 is constant and field independent , where @xmath27 denotes the local magnetic induction inside a sample .",
    "thus , the critical current density ( or irreversible magnetization ) should also be field independent , which is contrary to most experimental results .",
    "other critical - state models , such as the exponential and the watson models,@xcite which take into account the field dependence of the critical current density , can be used to describe the irreversible magnetization properly . in the frame of the watson model , the critical current density , @xmath28 ,",
    "is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are adjustable parameters which depend on the material .",
    "the exponential model proposes that the critical current density has the form @xmath32 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are again adjustable parameters as in the watson model .",
    "according to ampere s law , the field gradient inside a sample is given by @xmath33 where sgn(@xmath34 ) is the sign function and @xmath35 is the speed of light . in cylindrical coordinates ,",
    "we obtain an average magnetic induction @xmath36 of a sample with a radius @xmath37 @xmath38 if the surface barrier effect is ignored , the boundary condition for @xmath27 is @xmath39 , where @xmath14 is the external magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows our attempt to fit @xmath2 at @xmath40 k by using eq .",
    "( [ avginduction ] ) with the exponential critical - state model with @xmath41 emu/@xmath42 and @xmath43 t. for the theoretical description of the @xmath2 , we can choose an arbitrary number for a sample size , @xmath37 , within the constraint that the multiplier @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "as one can see , the data are well described by the critical - state model without considering the contribution of the reversible magnetization and the surface barrier effect . as stated before",
    ", this implies that , in the mixed state in the mgb@xmath9 superconductor , the magnetization mainly comes from the contribution of the bulk pinning effect .",
    "a fit using the watson model was also attempted , but was poor for all adjustments of the parameters .",
    "the dashed line of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) represents the average critical current density @xmath45 calculated from the decreasing - field branch of the theoretical magnetization curve assuming the grain size @xmath46 @xmath47 m .",
    "we note that the shapes of the @xmath2 curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are remarkably similar to each other .",
    "this suggests that the vortex pinning mechanism in mgb@xmath9 does not change even as the temperature is varied up to near @xmath8 .",
    "more concrete evidence for this can be found from the scaling analysis of the @xmath2 curves .",
    "for the scaling of the @xmath2 curves , we define two phenomenological parameters as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "@xmath3 means the field where the magnetization in the increasing field branch reaches it s maximum value @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig2 ] by @xmath49 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . without any exception ,",
    "all the curves collapse on a single universal curve .",
    "the solid line in the figure denotes the exponential critical - state model .",
    "this result is consistent with the scaling of the pinning force , @xmath50 , in a temperature range of @xmath51 reported by larbalestier _",
    "et al_.@xcite in the case of high-@xmath8 cuprates , such scaling behavior of the @xmath2 curves is established in a limited low - temperature region .",
    "this implies that the fundamental mechanism determining the magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures changes as the temperature is increased toward @xmath8 . for bi@xmath9sr@xmath9cacu@xmath9o@xmath52 ( bi-2212 ) , while the bulk pinning is dominant at low temperatures , the contribution of the surface or geometrical barrier effects to the magnetization becomes more important as the temperature is increased.@xcite thus , universal scaling of @xmath2 is not seen in bi-2212 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the temperature dependence of the scaling parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 used in the above analysis .",
    "the right axis for @xmath3 in the figure was corrected by the demagnetization factor @xmath53 .",
    "the value of @xmath54 was obtained from the low - field susceptibility curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] assuming 100 % magnetic screening .",
    "it was obvious that the @xmath55 and @xmath56 scaled lineally with temperature as indicated by solid lines .",
    "the linearity in @xmath56 requires a linear temperature dependence of the irreversible field @xmath57 where the magnetic hysteresis disappears .",
    "this is because the normalized hysteresis curves @xmath2 for @xmath58 collapsed into a single universal curve as we showed .",
    "in fact , a nearly linear @xmath16 was shown from the kramer analysis of magnetization.@xcite this feature differentiates mgb@xmath9 from other cuprate high-@xmath8 materials with @xmath59 .",
    "in summary , we measured the magnetization curves @xmath2 for the newly discovered metallic mgb@xmath9 superconductor , which has a @xmath60 k , in the region 5 k @xmath61 33 k and @xmath625 t @xmath63 5 t. the magnetic hysteresis in our experimental region was well described by the exponential critical - state model , without considering the reversible magnetization and the surface barrier effect .",
    "also , we found that all the magnetization curves collapsed onto a single universal curve when the field and the magnetization were normalized by the characteristic scaling factors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
