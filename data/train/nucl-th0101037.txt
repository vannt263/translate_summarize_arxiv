    "fission of highly excited compound nuclei formed in heavy ion induced fusion reactions has emerged as a topic of considerable theoretical and experimental interest in recent years .",
    "multiplicity measurements of light particles and photons emitted in the prescission stage strongly suggest @xcite that fission is a much slower process for hot nuclei than that determined from the statistical model of bohr and wheeler @xcite based on phase space arguements .",
    "this led to a revival of theoretical studies based on the original work of kramers @xcite who considered fission of excited nuclei as a consequence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "dynamical models for fission based on fokker - planck equation @xcite and langevin equation @xcite were subsequently developed .",
    "the most extensive application of langevin equation to study fission dynamics was made by froebrich _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite .",
    "a combined dynamical and statistical model for fission was employed in their calculations where a switching over to a statistical model description was made when the fission process reached the stationary regime .",
    "fission widths which are required for the statistical branch of the calculation were obtained from the stationary limits of fission rates from langevin equation @xcite .",
    "the dissipative property of nuclei is an important input to the langevin dynamical calculations , the choice of which is not yet fully settled and continues to be an open question .",
    "a detailed comparison @xcite of the calculated fission probability and prescission neutron multiplicity excitation functions for a number of nuclei with the experimental data led to a phenomenological shape dependent nuclear friction .",
    "the phenomenological friction turned out to be considerably smaller ( @xmath0 ) than the standard wall formula value for nuclear friction for compact shapes of the fissioning nucleus whereas a strong increase of this friction was found to be necessary at large deformations . a clear physical picture for such a friction is yet to be developed and the present work is an effort in this direction .",
    "the wall formula for nuclear friction was developed by blocki _",
    "@xcite in a simple classical picture of one - body dissipation .",
    "it was also derived from a formal theory based on classical linear response theory @xcite .",
    "one crucial assumption of the wall formula concerns the randomization of the particle ( nucleon ) motion due to the successive collisions it suffers at the nuclear surface .",
    "in other words , a complete mixing in the classical phase space of the particle motion is required .",
    "it was early realized @xcite that any deviation from this randomization assumption would give rise to a reduced strength of the wall formula .",
    "further , nix and sierk suggested @xcite in their analysis of mean fragment kinetic energy data that the dissipation is about four times weaker than that predicted by the wall plus window formula of one - body dissipation .",
    "however , it is only recently that a modification of the wall formula has been proposed @xcite in which the full randomization assumption is relaxed in order to make it applicable to systems in which the mixing in phase space is partial . considering only those chaotic particle trajectories which arise due to irregularity in the shape of the one - body potential and which are responsible for irreversible energy tranfer ,",
    "a modified friction coefficient was obtained in ref.@xcite . in what follows",
    ", we shall use the term `` chaos weighted wall formula '' ( cwwf ) for this modified friction in order to distinguish it from the original wall formula ( wf ) friction . as was shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", the cwwf friction coefficient @xmath1 will be given as ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the friction coefficient as was given by the original wall formula @xcite and @xmath4 is a measure of chaos ( chaoticity ) in the single - particle motion and depends on the instantaneous shape of the nucleus . the value of chaoticity @xmath5 changes from 0 to 1 as the nucleus evolves from the spherical shape to a highly deformed one .",
    "the cwwf friction is thus much smaller than wf friction for compact nuclear shapes while they become closer at large deformations .",
    "the cwwf friction was subsequently found @xcite to describe satisfactorily the collective energy damping of cavities containing classical particles and undergoing time - dependent shape evolutions .",
    "thus the supression of the strength of wall formula friction achieved in chaos weighted wall formula suggests that chaos in single particle motion ( rather lack of it ) can provide a physical explanation for the reduction in strength of friction for compact nuclear shapes as required in the phenomenological friction of ref.@xcite and this has motivated us to apply cwwf friction to fission dynamics in the present work .",
    "we shall present in this paper a systematic study of fission rates by using both cwwf and wf frictions in langevin equation .",
    "the aim of our study is twofold .",
    "first , we would like to find the effect of introducing the chaoticity factor in friction on fission rate at different excitation energies and spins of the compound nucleus .",
    "the second one concerns a parametric representation of the fission widths the need for which arises as follows .",
    "fission width is an essential input along with particle and @xmath6 widths for a statistical theory in the stationary branch of compound nucleus decay .",
    "kramers @xcite obtained a simple expression for the stationary fission width assuming a large separation between the saddle and scission points and a constant friction .",
    "gontchar _ et .",
    "@xcite later derived a more general expression taking the scission point explicitly into account but still assuming a constant friction coefficient .",
    "the cwwf friction however is not constant and is strongly shape dependent and hence the corresponding stationary fission width can not be analytically obtained .",
    "thus it becomes necessary to find a suitable parametrization of the numerically obtained stationary fission widths using cwwf friction in order to use them in the statistical regime of the compound nucleus decay .",
    "we shall concentrate upon the parametric representation of fission widths in the present work while the application of cwwf friction in a full dynamical plus statistical model will be reported in a future publication .",
    "we shall describe the langevin equation along with the necessary inputs as used in the present calculation in the next section .",
    "the calculated fission rates and the systematics of the stationary fission widths will be given in sec.iii .",
    "a summary of the results will be presented in the last section .",
    "in order to specify the collective coordinates for a dynamical description of nuclear fission , we will use the @xmath7 parametrisation of brack _ et . al _",
    ". we will consider only symmetric fission ( @xmath8 ) and will further neglect the neck degree of freedom ( @xmath9 ) to simplify the calculation .",
    "the surface of a nucleus of mass number @xmath10 will then be defined as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 in cylindrical coordinates for the elongation parameter @xmath14 . considering @xmath14 and its conjugate momentum @xmath15 as the dynamical variables , the langevin equation in one dimension will be given @xcite as , @xmath16    in the above equations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the shape - dependent collective inertia and friction coefficients respectively .",
    "the free energy of the system is denoted by @xmath19 while @xmath20 represents the random part of the interaction between the fission degree of freedom and the rest of the nuclear degrees of freedom considered as a thermal bath in the present picture .",
    "we will use the werner - wheeler approximation for incompressible irrotational flow to calculate the collective inertia @xcite .",
    "the driving force in a thermodynamic system should be derived from the free energy for which we will use the following expression valid for the fermi gas model @xcite , @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the temperature of the system and @xmath23 is the coordinate dependent level density parameter which is given as @xcite , @xmath24    the values for the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the dimensionless surface area @xmath27 are chosen following ref.@xcite .    for the potential energy @xmath28 ,",
    "it is only the deformation dependent part of it which is relevant for our calculation .",
    "this deformation dependent potential energy is obtained from the finite range liquid drop model @xcite where we calculate the generalized nuclear energy by double folding the uniform density within the surface ( eq.[seqn2 ] ) with a yukawa - plus - exponential potential .",
    "the coulomb energy is obtained by double folding another yukawa function with the density distribution .",
    "the various input parameters are taken from ref.@xcite where they were determined from fitting fission barriers of a wide range of nuclei .",
    "the centrifugal part of the potential is calculated using the rigid body moment of inertia .",
    "the instantaneous random force @xmath20 plays a very crucial role in the langevin description of nuclear fission . as a result of receiving incessant random kicks ,",
    "the fission degree of freedom can finally pick up enough kinetic energy to overcome the fission barrier .",
    "this random force is modelled after that of a typical brownian motion and is assumed to have a stochastic nature with a gaussian distribution whose average is zero @xcite .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath20 has extremely short correlation time implying that the intrinsic nuclear dynamics is markovian .",
    "consequently the strength of the random force can be obtained from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the properties of @xmath20 can be written as , @xmath29      one - body dissipation was used more successfully in fission dynamics than two - body viscosity in the past @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we shall consider the one - body wall - and - window dissipation @xcite to account for the friction coefficient @xmath18 in the langevin equation .",
    "for the one - body wall dissipation , we shall use the chaos weighted wall formula ( eq.[seqn1 ] ) introduced in the preceeding section . in order to arrive at this expression ,",
    "the particle trajectories moving in the one - body nuclear potential were identified as either regular or chaotic depending on their nature of time evolution @xcite .",
    "originating from a given point near the nuclear surface and moving in a given direction , a regular trajectory closes smoothly in phase space . on the other hand , another trajectory leaving the same point but",
    "in a different direction could be a chaotic one which does not close in phase space .",
    "considering the contributions of these two types of trajectories separately , it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that only the chaotic trajectories give rise to the irreversible energy transfer and the resulting friction coefficient acting on the wall motion will be as given in eq.[seqn1 ] .",
    "the chaoticity @xmath5 is a measure of chaos in the single - particle motion of the nucleons within the nuclear volume and in the present classical picture will be given as the average fraction of the trajectories which are chaotic when the sampling is done uniformly over the nuclear surface .",
    "the chaoticity is a specific property of the nonintegrability of the nuclear shape .",
    "thus it is required to be calculated for all possible shapes upto the scission configuration . a typical calculation of chaoticity for a given shape proceeds as follows .",
    "the initial coordinates of a classical trajectory starting from the nuclear surface is chosen by sampling of a suitably defined set of random numbers such that all the initial coordinates follow an uniform distribution over the nuclear surface .",
    "the initial direction of the trajectory is also chosen randomly and its lyapunov exponent is then obtained by following the trajectory for a considerable length of time . each trajectory is identified as regular or chaotic by considering the magnitude of its lyapunov exponent and the nature of its variation with time .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have calculated the chaoticity for a range of shapes from oblate to the scission configuration ( at @xmath30 where the neck radius becomes zero ) at small steps of @xmath14 , the elongation coordinate .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the calculated values of chaoticity which will be subsequently employed to obtain the chaos weighted wall formula friction .",
    "it is important to note here that chaoticity is very small for near spherical shapes ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this immediately implies , through eq.[seqn1 ] , a strong suppression of the original wall formula friction for compact shapes of the compound nucleus .",
    "chaoticity however increases as the shape becomes more oblate or changes towards scission configuration .",
    "we find here that the full chaotic regime ( @xmath32 ) in single particle dynamics is not reached even at the scission configuration .",
    "this observation is specific to the shape parametrization ( eq.[seqn2 ] ) used in the present calculation .",
    "it was observed earlier that the value of chaoticity reaches @xmath33 near the scission point when legendre polynomial @xmath34 deformed quadrupole shapes were considered @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to speculate at this point to what extent the final calculated observables will be sensitive to the choice of the shape parametrisation .",
    "we shall use the following expression to calculate the wall formula friction coefficient @xcite , @xmath35}^{-{1 \\over 2}}dz\\right .\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left .\\int_{z_n}^{z_{max } } { \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\rho^2}{\\partial c } + \\frac{\\partial \\rho^2}{\\partial z } \\frac{\\partial d_2}{\\partial c}\\right)}^2 { \\left[\\rho^2 + { \\left({1 \\over 2 } \\frac{\\partial \\rho^2}{\\partial z}\\right)}^2\\right]}^{-{1 \\over 2}}dz \\right\\ } , \\label{seqn7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the mass density of the nucleus , @xmath37 is the average nucleon speed inside the nucleus and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the positions of the centers of mass of the two parts of the fissioning system relative to the center of mass of the whole system . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the two extreme ends of the nuclear shape along the @xmath42 axis and @xmath43 is the position of the neck plane which divides the nucleus into two parts .",
    "the chaos weighted wall formula friction is subsequently obtained from eq.[seqn1 ] as @xmath44 . defining a quantity @xmath45 as the reduced friction coefficient",
    ", its dependence on the elongation coordinate is shown in fig.[fig2 ] for both wf and cwwf frictions for the @xmath46 nucleus .",
    "the reduction in the strength of the wall friction due to chaos considerations is evident from this figure .",
    "we shall now consider the role of window friction in one - body dissipation .",
    "the window friction is expected to be effective after a neck is formed in the nuclear system @xcite .",
    "further , the radius of the neck connecting the two future fragments should be sufficiently narrow in order to enable a particle which has crossed the window from one side to the other to remain within the other fragment for a sufficiently long time .",
    "this is necessary to allow the particle to suffer enough collisions within the other side and make the energy transfer irreversible .",
    "it therefore appears that the window friction should be very nominal when neck formation just begins .",
    "its strength should however increase as the neck becomes narrower reaching its classical value when the neck radius becomes much smaller than the typical radii of the fragments .",
    "little is however known regarding the detailed nature of such a transition .",
    "we shall therefore refrain from making any further assumption regarding the onset of window friction .",
    "instead , we shall define a critical elongation coordinate @xmath47 beyond which the window friction will be switched on .",
    "the window friction coefficient will then be given as , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the distance between centers of mass of future fragments and @xmath51 is the area of the window between the two parts of the system .",
    "the full one - body friction will now be written as , @xmath52    and in what follows , we will use either @xmath53 or @xmath54 for @xmath55 in the above expression . for the window friction",
    ", the value of @xmath47 is taken as 1.9 where the neck radius is half of the fragment radius .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the reduced one - body friction coefficients . the phenomenological reduced friction obtained in ref.@xcite is also shown in fig.[fig3 ] . though the one - body friction with cwwf agrees qualitatively with the phenomenological friction for @xmath56 , it is beyond its scope to explain the steep increase of phenomenological friction for @xmath57 .",
    "it may be noted however that the compulsion of having a very strong friction at large deformations was to allow enough neutrons to evaporate during the saddle to scission transition ( i.e. after fission has taken place ) in order to fit the experimental prescission neutron multiplicities for very heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , the role of a very strong friction beyond the saddle point will not be significant for fission rates which is of our present concern .",
    "with all the necessary inputs defined as above , the langevin equation ( eq.[seqn3 ] ) is numerically integrated following the procedure outlined in ref.@xcite .",
    "a very small time step of @xmath58 for numerical integration is used in the present work .",
    "the numerical stability of the results is checked by repeating a few calculations with still smaller time steps .",
    "the initial distribution of the coordinates and momenta are assumed to be close to equilibrium and hence the initial values of @xmath59 are chosen from sampling random numbers following the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "starting with a given total excitation energy ( @xmath60 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath61 ) of the compound nucleus , the energy conservation in the following form , @xmath62 gives the intrinsic excitation energy @xmath63 and the corresponding nuclear temperature @xmath64 at each integration step .",
    "the centrifugal potential is included in @xmath28 in the above equation .",
    "a langevin trajectory will be considered as undergone fission if it reaches the scission point ( @xmath65 ) in course of its time evolution .",
    "the calculations are repeated for a large number ( typically 100,000 or more ) of trajectories and the number of fission events are recorded as a function of time . from these , the fission rates can be easily evaluated @xcite .    a typical langevin trajectory which has reached the scission point and has ended up as a fission event is shown in fig.[fig4 ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "another trajectory , the kind of which is less frequent , is shown in the lower panel of the same figure .",
    "the langevin trajectory in this case crosses the saddle point and after spending some time beyond the saddle point drifts back into the potential pocket again .",
    "such trajectories may or may not finally reach the scission point within the observation time and corresponds to a to - and - fro motion across the saddle and essentially portrays the stochastic nature of the dynamics .",
    "this point is further illustrated in fig.[fig5 ] where time development of the fission rates are plotted .",
    "two different criteria are used to define a fission event here .",
    "the filled circles correspond to fission events defined as those trajectories reaching the scission point whereas the open circles correspond to those crossing the saddle point .",
    "the fission rate is very small for both the cases at the beginning when the compound nucleus is just formed and the langevin dynamics has just been turned on . subsequently the fission rate grows with time and after a certain equilibration time it reaches a stationary value which corresponds to a steady flow across the barrier .",
    "the fission rate defined at the saddle point reaches the stationary value earlier than that defined at the scission point .",
    "the time difference between them gives the average time of descent from the saddle to the scission .",
    "this observation was also made in earlier works @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present discussion is to investigate the role of backstreaming in the fission process .",
    "it is observed in fig.[fig5 ] that the stationary fission rate at saddle point is higher than that at the scission point .",
    "the difference between these two stationary rates can be regarded as due to backstreaming .",
    "the backstreaming is thus small compared to the steady outward flow though it is not negligible .",
    "this also shows that crossing the saddle point is not an adequate criteria for fission in stochastic calculations and can lead to an overestimation of the fission rate .",
    "we shall now compare fission rates calculated with chaos weighted wall - and- window friction with those obtained with wall - and - window friction ( eq.[seqn9 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the fission widths at three spins of the compound nucleus @xmath46 .",
    "the effect of suppression in the chaos weighted wall formula shows up as an enhancement by about a factor of 2 of the stationary fission rates .",
    "similar enhancement of the stationary fission rate calculated with chaos weighted wall - and - window friction in comparison with that obtained with wall - and - window friction are also observed for a wide range of compound nuclear spin and temperature .",
    "the enhancement factor ( of about 2 ) remains almost the same when different choices of @xmath47 are used in the window friction ( eq.[seqn8 ] ) .",
    "we next systematically extracted the stationary fission widths at different temperatures for a given spin of the compound nucleus .",
    "this was done by taking the average of the fission rates in the plateau region .",
    "these fission rates are essentially the kramers limit of the langevin equation under consideration and we expect the stationary fission widths @xmath66 to depend upon the temperature @xmath22 as @xmath67 for a given spin ( @xmath61 ) of the compound nucleus where @xmath68 is the height of the fission barrier in the free energy profile and @xmath69 is a parameter . such a dependence of stationary fission widths on temperature was indeed found and is shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 can now be extracted by fitting the calculated fission widths with the above expression .",
    "subsequently we looked into the dependence of the parameter @xmath69 on @xmath61 , a few typical plots of which are shown in fig.[fig8 ] . using these values of @xmath69 , one can now obtain this parameter value for any arbitrary spin by interpolation .",
    "even with a limited number of calculated values , the interpolated values will be quite reliable since @xmath69 depends on @xmath61 rather weakly as can be seen in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "consequently it becomes possible to extract the fission width of a compound nucleus of any given temperature and spin from a set of a limited number of calculated widths .",
    "this fact will be very useful in statistical model calculations where fission widths are required at numerous values of temperature and spin which are encountered during evolution of a compound nucleus .",
    "therefore in such cases where analytical expressions for fission widths can not be obtained , the above systematics can generate fission widths from a limited set of calculations .",
    "two time scales are of physical significance in the langevin description of dynamics of fission .",
    "one is the equilibration time @xmath70 , the time required to attain a steady flow across the barrier .",
    "the other is the fission life time @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows these time intervals for different values of spin of the compound nucleus @xmath46 . at very small values of spin ,",
    "the fission life time is many times longer than the equilibration time .",
    "this means that a statistical theory for compound nuclear decay is applicable in such cases . on the other hand , @xmath70 and @xmath72",
    "become comparable at higher values of the compound nuclear spin and this corresponds to a dynamics dominated decay of the compound nucleus .",
    "statistical models are not meaningful in these cases and dynamical descriptions such as langevin equation become essential for fission of a compound nucleus .",
    "in the preceeding sections , we have presented a systematic study of fission dynamics using langevin equation . among the various physical inputs required for solving the langevin equation , we paid particular attention to the dissipative force for which we chose the wall - and - window one - body friction .",
    "we used a modified form of wall friction , the chaos weighted wall formula , in our calculation .",
    "the chaos weighted wall formula took into account the nonintegrabilty of single particle motion in the nucleus and it resulted in a strong suppression of friction strength for near spherical shapes of the nucleus .",
    "the fission widths calculated with chaos weighted wall formula turned out to be about twice the widths calculated with the normal wall formula friction .",
    "the chaos weighted wall friction thus enhances the fission rate substantially compared to that obtained with normal wall friction .",
    "we further made a parametric representation of the calculated fission widths in terms of the temperature and spin of the compound nucleus .",
    "it was found that this parametrised form can be well determined from the fission widths calculated over a grid of spin and temperature values of limited size .",
    "this fact would make it possible to perform statistical model calculation of the decay of a highly excited compound nucleus where the fission widths are to be determined from a dynamical model such as the langevin equation .",
    "when the friction form factor has a strong shape dependence as in the chaos weighted wall formula , the corresponding fission widths can not be obtained in an analytic form . in such cases , the frequently required values of the fission width in a statistical model calculation can be made economically accessible through the parametrised representation of the fission width which has to be obtained in a separate calculation similar to the present one .",
    "we shall report on such applications of the parametrised fission widths in compound nuclear decay in our future works .",
