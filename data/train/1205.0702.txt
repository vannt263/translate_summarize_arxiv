    "we refer to the main paper .",
    "the interest in the set of equations ( [ eq : gifirstt]-[eq : gicfirstt ] ) is that it determines the spectrum of @xmath126 through @xmath127_{21 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 .",
    "it is also possible to determine other quantities such as the diagonal correlator of eigenvectors @xcite , but we do not elaborate on this point in this paper .    the equations ( [ eq : gifirstt ] ) and ( [ eq : gicfirstt ] ) have been derived for the first time in the recent work @xcite .",
    "however , a rigorous derivation of these equations has not been presented yet .",
    "the conjecture is that they are exact when @xmath7 and when the underlying graph structure is locally tree - like . by the underlying graph",
    "we mean the connectivity graph one can form when connecting all points @xmath23 which have @xmath42 .",
    "the exactness of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gifirstt ] ) and ( [ eq : gicfirstt ] ) is strongly supported by a very good agreement between their numerical solution and direct diagonalization methods @xcite .",
    "the concept of a local - tree like structure is properly defined in @xcite and intuitively it means that most of the vertices have a finite neighborhood , where short loops are absent .",
    "this is true for randomly drawn graphs when they are very large @xcite .",
    "of course it is true that many real - world graphs are not constructed by a random algorithm and contain an intricate loop structure .",
    "nevertheless , it remains interesting to consider random systems as a first model for complex systems .",
    "in this supplemental material we present an alternative derivation of the set of equations ( [ eq : gifirstt]-[eq : gicfirstt ] ) .",
    "the main difference between our method and the approach presented in @xcite is that we avoid a mapping on a statistical mechanics problem .",
    "therefore , the assumptions become more intuitive as we avoid the factorization of a complex valued function @xcite , which plays a role analogous to local marginals in spin models .",
    "another advantage of our approach is that it stands much closer to resolvent methods used for rigorous spectral calculations on dense matrices @xcite .      in this supplemental material",
    "we present how the polarized bethe lattice leads to a non - trivial solution to the resolvent equations .",
    "we present the exact analytical solution to the resolvent equations in this case .",
    "the spectral density of @xmath126 is obtained from the resolvent @xmath10 through equation @xmath11 .",
    "the first step of the method consists in mapping the calculation of the spectrum of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath1 on a resolvent calculation of the hermitian matrix @xmath17 @xcite , defined as @xmath128 where @xmath19 is a @xmath20 matrix filled with zeros and @xmath21 is a regulator which keeps all quantities properly defined . in this framework",
    ", the spectrum follows from @xmath129 . \\label{spectrt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hermitization procedure can also be presented graphically , as can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "it corresponds to the translation of an oriented graph to an unoriented bipartite graph .",
    "indeed , we can associate to the matrix @xmath1 a graph @xmath130 , with the set of vertices @xmath131 $ ] and the set of edges @xmath132 .",
    "each edge has a weight @xmath133 , which is denoted by the mapping @xmath134 .",
    "the edge is undirected when @xmath135 , otherwise it is directed .",
    "therefore , the translation @xmath136 corresponds to a translation from an oriented graph to a bipartite unoriented graph .",
    "from equation ( [ spectr ] ) we see that to calculate the spectrum , we need to have an expression for the diagonal elements of the resolvent @xmath137 . since this involves the inverse of a matrix , the following formula is very useful : @xmath138 the above formula is referred to as the schur - complement formula , and it is a common tool in the determination of spectra of dense matrices @xcite .",
    "recently the schur - complement formula has also been applied to derive the kesten - mckay law @xcite . here",
    "we present a calculation similar to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "when relabeling the indices of a matrix we do not change its eigenvalues .",
    "we use this property and relabel all the vertices such that @xmath139 .",
    "it becomes useful to label each couple @xmath140 by @xmath33 and write @xmath141 as a matrix consisting of @xmath142 blocks . in this matrix",
    "we have on the diagonal the @xmath142 matrix @xmath143 while the @xmath144-th block is denoted by @xmath145 .",
    "we therefore find @xmath146 where the prime denotes the fact that we have relabeled the indices in @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , the matrix @xmath147 is the relabeled matrix following from the above permutation operation on the matrix @xmath148 .",
    "let us consider now the unoriented graph @xmath149 , with @xmath150 $ ] , @xmath151 and @xmath152 for all edges .",
    "we perform now a first depth search around a certain root vertex @xmath153 in this unoriented graph and label the vertices accordingly .",
    "we define the rooted matrix @xmath154 , as the matrix which we have created from @xmath155 through a permutation according to the first - depth search around @xmath153 .",
    "we have therefore for @xmath156 : @xmath157 we have introduced the degree @xmath158 , which denotes the number of matrix elements @xmath159 , @xmath160 , which are different than zero .",
    "the matrices @xmath161 correspond to a subgraph of @xmath162 associated to one of the children nodes ( or branches ) of @xmath153 .",
    "this picture is visualized in figure 1 .",
    "we apply now the schur - complement formula , to find : @xmath163_{11}&\\left [ \\left(\\bb^{(n)}\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{12}\\\\ \\left[\\left(\\bb^{(n)}\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{21}&\\left [ \\left(\\bb^{(n)}\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{22}\\end{array}\\right ) & = & \\frac{1}{-\\blambda - \\sum^{k_n}_{j=1}\\left ( \\ba_{nn_j } \\bzero_2 \\cdots \\bzero_2 \\right ) \\left(\\bb^{(n)}_{n_j}\\right)^{-1}\\left ( \\ba_{nn_j } \\bzero_2 \\cdots \\bzero_2 \\right)^\\dagger } \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq:8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that to determine the right hand side of equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) , it is necessary to have an expression in the upper @xmath142 dimensional block of the inverse of the matrix @xmath161 , i.  e. , we need to know the elements @xmath164_{11}$ ] , @xmath164_{12}$ ] , @xmath164_{21}$ ] and @xmath164_{22}$ ] .",
    "these elements can be determined using again the schur - complement formula ( hence the recursion ) .",
    "since @xmath161 is the matrix corresponding to one of the subgraphs of @xmath162 , we have ( setting @xmath165 ) @xmath166 after applying again the schur - complement formula , we can close the resultant set of equations using @xmath167 , for all @xmath168 and @xmath169 , with @xmath170 . using this approximation",
    "we find the closed set of equations ( [ eq : gifirstt]-[eq : gicfirstt ] ) . indeed , setting @xmath171_{11}&\\left [ \\left(\\bb^{(n)}_m\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{12}\\\\ \\left[\\left(\\bb^{(n)}_m\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{21}&\\left [ \\left(\\bb^{(n)}_m\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{22}\\end{array}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath172_{11}&\\left [ \\left(\\bb^{(n)}_m\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{12}\\\\ \\left[\\left(\\bb^{(n)}_m\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{21}&\\left [ \\left(\\bb^{(n)}_m\\right)^{-1}\\right]_{22}\\end{array}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recover indeed the equations ( [ eq : gifirstt]-[eq : gicfirstt ] ) .",
    "we remark that the condition @xmath167 is indeed exact on a tree .",
