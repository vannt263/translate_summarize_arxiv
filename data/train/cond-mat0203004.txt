    ", it remains an open problem whether or not fermions have a stable diffusive metallic phase .",
    "such a phase , if it exists , could not be adiabatically connected to the fermi liquid @xcite since the non - interacting fermi gas is always insulating in the presence of disorder in @xmath3 . in the limit of weak disorder , this can be understood as a quantum interference effect which is singular as a result of the diffusive nature of electron propagation in a disordered system : diffusion at intermediate length scales ( longer than the elastic mean - free path ) thwarts diffusion at long scales ( longer than the localization length ) @xcite .",
    "the interacting - electron problem remains unresolved because interactions in the spin - triplet channel are also singular as a result of the languid pace of diffusive motion@xcite .",
    "the upshot of the interplay between these different singularities is unknown ( see , however , ref . ) .",
    "consider the critical point separating the insulating and superfluid phases of a perfectly clean system of bosons at @xmath1 in @xmath4 .",
    "we would like to draw an analogy between it and the free fermi gas . in the bosonic case",
    ", there is a particular value of the chemical potential for which the system has gapless critical modes , loosely analogous to the excitations of the free fermi gas . for any other value of the chemical potential ,",
    "the bosons are either in a superfluid state  a superconducting state , if we assume that the bosons are cooper pairs  or in a gapped insulating state .",
    "suppose we now add disorder to this system .",
    "what is the fate of this critical point ? on general grounds , we believe that it is unlikely to broaden into a stable diffusive metallic phase , and that the only stable phases are insulating ( mott insulator or bose glass @xcite ) or superconducting .",
    "instead , we expect a diffusive metallic critical point with a _",
    "universal _ conductivity separating the insulating and superconducting phases .",
    "the analogy between fermi and bose systems is imprecise , but it emphasizes the important point that in both cases there is a ballistic critical point in the clean system which must be usurped by a diffusive fixed point in the disordered one .",
    "such a fixed point should be amenable to analysis by methods similar to those used for the diffusive fermi liquid .",
    "conversely , expansion about the pure critical point",
    " which is ballistic , not diffusive  should fail .",
    "in considering such a perspective , one is faced with the following question : why do quantum interference effects , which appear to be such an inevitable consequence of diffusive motion , not preclude a finite conductivity at the superfluid - insulator transition ?",
    "the answer must lie in the effects of interactions , which one might hope to tame since spinless bosons , such as singlet cooper pairs , do not have a triplet channel  the troublesome , singular one  through which to interact .    in this paper , we present the results of such an analysis .",
    "we find that there are two competing effects at a putative @xmath4 diffusive bose liquid critical point : one resulting from interactions between the bosons ; the other , from quantum interference , i.e. weak localization . in the fermionic case ,",
    "it is advisable to consider quantum interference and interactions on the same footing since they lead to similar logarithmic corrections at the perturbative level . in the bosonic case",
    ", one must perforce do so , since quantum interference leads to the existence of localized states even in the weak disorder limit , and bosons would congregate in the lowest energy localized state in the absence of interactions .",
    "we find that the effect of interactions is stronger than quantum interference and drives the system to a perfect conductor , thereby explaining how diffusion can remain impervious to localization .",
    "this result is congenial to one s intuition that repulsive interactions should disfavor localization .",
    "potential wells due to impurities diminish in attractiveness when they are occupied and , as a result , the random potential is effectively screened .",
    "this effect is present for both short - ranged interactions as well as long - ranged coulomb interactions , but is stronger in the latter case .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in fermionic systems as well , but it competes with the exchange part of the interaction , which is opposite in sign due to fermi statistics . if the interaction is short - ranged , it is irrelevant for spinless fermions , so it has no effect on the conductivity in the infrared limit .",
    "( this is clear in the @xmath5-function limit , where the direct and exchange interactions cancel . ) in the case of coulomb interactions , the exchange interaction between spinless fermions dominates and suppresses the conductivity . in the case of spin-@xmath6 fermions ,",
    "the runaway flow of the triplet interaction amplitude indicates that the hartree interaction begins to prevail over the exchange interaction at longer length scales , thereby leading to an enhanced conductivity .",
    "however , the interaction strength diverges before a metallic fixed point is reached , and no conclusion can be drawn about the existence of a metallic state at zero - temperature .",
    "these difficulties do not arise in the bosonic case .",
    "the exchange interaction has the same sign as the direct one , and both enhance the conductivity .",
    "our result is valid for large conductivities in units of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , if the bare conductivity is large  as it can be if the bosons have an anisotropic mass tensor  then the renormalized conductivity is infinite .",
    "if the bare conductivity is small , then there are two possibilities .",
    "if the conductivity initially flows to sufficiently large values that we can apply our calculation , then it will continue to flow to infinity .",
    "however , it is also possible that the system will flow in this case to a different fixed point at which the conductivity if finite . in such a scenario , there would be two different possible universality classes of superconductor - insulator transitions . in either case",
    ", we conclude that it is a consistent possibility for the critical point between the superfluid and insulating states of a disordered bose liquid to be a _",

    "following , we will treat the cooper pairs in a dirty superconductor as bosons moving in a random potential .",
    "we will assume that all fermionic degrees of freedom are gapped or localized and are therefore unimportant .",
    "this assumption has been called into question recently @xcite .",
    "if fermionic degrees of freedom prove to play an important role at the superconductor - insulator transition , then our analysis will need to be modified to include them , but our description of dirty bosons will remain an important component of a richer description of the superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "note that we are studying here the generic transition @xcite between the bose glass and superfluid phases which occurs at an incommmenusurate boson density . in the special case",
    "in which there are an integer number of bosons per lattice site , there may be a direct transition between mott insulating and superfluid phases which is tuned by varying the ratio of the hopping and interaction parameters @xcite .",
    "we begin with a system of interacting bosons moving in a random potential in two dimensions .",
    "the derivation which follows goes through in arbitrary dimension with minor changes , but @xmath3 is the most interesting case .",

    "this does _ not _ preclude critical behavior in the single - particle properties , as has already been seen in the context of interacting fermions @xcite and of quasiparticles in a disordered @xmath31-wave superconductor where there are density - of - states corrections and also in the context of non - interacting electrons with an extra sublattice symmetry , where the single - particle green function itself is critical @xcite .",
    "the conductivity is small because there are no particle - hole pairs for @xmath32 ( since the transition occurs at the bottom of a quadratic band ) .",
    "a finite lifetime leads to a small density of states @xmath33 for particle - hole pairs , which cancels the factor of the lifetime to which @xmath8 is customarily proportional , thereby leading to a conductivity which is @xmath34 .",
    "however , we note that a parametrically large conductivity can be obtained in a slight generalization to a model of two species of bosons with anisotropic masses and that mix upon scattering .",

    "@xmath45 , so there is no fixed point at weak coupling ; instead , there is a runaway flow to strong disorder .",

    "the key assumption of finkelstein s theory @xcite for fermions is that the elevation of the energies of the diffusion modes by the @xmath47 term and the interactions can be neglected compared to the gaps associated with other degrees of freedom ; when this condition is satisfied , it is valid to retain only interacting diffusion modes and ignore all other degrees of freedom .",
    "we make the same assumption here in our description of the critical point . in the superfluid state , this is clearly not sufficient , and we will have to retain an extra degree of freedom .",
    "it may also be necessary to include extra degrees of freedom to properly describe the bose glass insulating state .",

    ", we see that the second term inside the square bracket in ( [ eqn : g - rg ] ) vanishes .",

    "another odd feature is the logarithmic approach to the critical resistivity which we find ; this logarithm is rather different from the type which are encountered in the lower critical dimension of a phase transition ( which happens to be @xmath145 for the superfluid - insulator transition ) .",
    "since a logarithmic flow is rather slow , it may not be possible to observe @xmath144 . instead",
    ", the critical conductivity at a given temperature may actually appear to be a non - universal number which depends on the bare conductivity .",

    "thus , we should not expect coulomb gap physics to suppress it and give @xmath157 . in the fermionic case ,",

    "we assume that their properties can be deduced from the the density - of - states .",
    "it is certainly possible for single - particle operators to be critical even in a theory in which only collective modes are retained ; this is the idea behind bosonization .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that our nl@xmath8 m is incomplete , as regards single - boson properties .",
    "this could occur if the critical exponent controlling the correlation function @xmath158 were unrelated to that controlling @xmath159 .    since @xmath83 diverges only logarithmically , the dynamical exponent , @xmath160 , as in a non - interacting system .",
    "however , in the case of dynamically - screened coulomb interactions , there are actually two different diverging time scales .",
    "one , with exponent @xmath155 , is the scale associated with @xmath83 ; it controls the scaling of the specific heat and energy diffusion .",
    "there is a second exponent , @xmath161 , associated with @xmath112 , which controls charge diffusion . by the same argument as in a fermionic system @xcite ,",

    "the density - of states and the dynamical exponent , @xmath161 , are the only quantities which distinguish short - ranged and dynamically - screened coulomb interactions in the infrared limit .",
    "as we discussed in section iv , the leading perturbation of our @xmath8 model is a @xmath89 term , where @xmath90 is a constant matrix say in replica space , which breaks the replica symmetry of the diffusive saddle - point manifold possibly in the direction of the bose - glass phase .",
    "this is a dimension @xmath103 operator at tree level .",
    "( if the matrix @xmath90 is proportional to the identity in replica space , this operator is instead just a constant at the diffusive saddle - point . )",
    "since the coupling constant @xmath108 flows to zero , we expect a critical exponent @xmath169 , up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "this value of @xmath170  the mean - field value  violates the bound @xmath171 of ref .",
    "however , such violation has been seen in other systems as well , and it has been argued @xcite that the exponent bounded by the theorem of ref .",
    "is , in fact , a finite - size scaling exponent which can be different from @xmath170 .",
    "diffusion in two dimensions is marginal , and small corrections ( in the limit of large conductivity ) such as that due to quantum interference or interactions can tip the balance one way or the other .",
    "contrary to conventional wisdom , it is hardly a foregone conclusion which effect will win .",
    "after all , weak localization is _ weak_. interactions can easily overpower it , leading to metallic behavior . according to our analysis ,",
    "this is precisely what occurs at the superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "the effect of interactions is so dominant that the universal value of the conductivity at the transition is infinity .",
    "such a diverging conductivity has been found in models with interaction and dissipation , but without disorder  @xcite .    the possibility of a metallic phase within the bose glass phase has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "we focus on the diffusive properties at the critical point , and do not investigate whether saddle - point solutions whithin the bose glass could lead to non - zero conductivities . however , it is noteworthy that an infinite critical conductivity is consistent with a bose metal with a diverging conductivity at the transition @xcite .",
    "we derive these results in a nl@xmath8 m approach , in which we discard those critical modes of the clean system which are extraneous and retain only the particle diffusion modes of the disordered system .",
    "the resulting nl@xmath8 m leads to a number of non - trivial predictions : ( 1 ) the critical conductivity is infinite ; ( 2 ) there are two diverging times scales if the interaction is coulombic , one associated with charge diffusion , which has exponent @xmath172 , the other associated with energy diffusion , which has exponent @xmath160 ; ( 3 ) the single - boson density of states diverges as @xmath173 , which implies a critical exponent @xmath166 in the case of coulomb interactions ; for short - range interactions , it diverges logarthmically ; ( 4 ) the correlation - length exponent takes the mean - field value @xmath169 .",
    "if boson - vortex duality were to hold exactly , then one would expect @xmath174 ( in units of @xmath175 ) .",
    "our result appears to imply that duality is violated logarithmically : bosons are more mobile than vortices in the infrared limit .",
    "however , it is hard to see how the physics of vortices enters at all into our calculation , so it is possible that we have missed important non - perturbative effects .",
    "our results do not agree with the numerical study of wallin , _",
    "_ @xcite . however , the flow to our fixed point is logarithmic , and this may be too slow for a numerical study on a finite - sized system .",
    "alternatively , they may simply be accessing a different fixed point which attracts systems with small bare conductivities . and finally , since their starting point studies phase but no amplitude fluctuations , the two models may simply be in different universality classes .",
    "our results also differ quantitatively from those of herbut , which are based on an expansion about @xmath145.@xcite    the measured critical exponents for the zero - field superconductor - insulator transition , which is accessed by varying the thickness of a thin film @xcite , are those of classical percolation .",
    "this does not agree with our theory , but it also suggests that the experiments are not quite in the asymptotic quantum critical regime , but rather in some higher - temperature classical regime .",

    "notice the difference between the fermionic and bosonic cases . in the fermionic case one can also interchange momentum @xmath75 integrals for energy @xmath39 integrals , using the density of states at the fermi level @xmath264 .",
    "the integrals are cut - off by the bottom of the band , @xmath265 away from the zero energy states . in the bosonic case ,",
    "one starts from the bottom of the band , and needs to include an energy dependent density of states @xmath266 ; the cut - off @xmath248 is introduced only for convergence , and @xmath267 is possible for @xmath262 .",
    "in contrast to the fermionic case , where @xmath264 is finite , in the bosonic case for a perfect parabolic spectrum @xmath267 .",
    "the small parameter for the fermi case is @xmath268 , whereas for the bose case it is @xmath269 .",
    "as we previously mentioned , we can easily obtain the rg equations for the conductance and interaction couplings by determining a correspondence with the fermionic model . here",
    "we show how this is achieved .",
    "let us first look at the finkelstein type terms in the effective action for the @xmath66 fields .",
    "the @xmath66 matrices are parameterized as in in eq.([eqn : q - param ] ) , repeated here for convenience . @xmath270",
    "the quantities that appear in the finkelstein type terms for the bosonic problem are @xmath271    direct comparison with the fermionic saddle point @xmath272 shows that the terms in the finkelstein type action for bosons , upon parameterization in terms of @xmath273 , are the same as the ones for fermions upon the identification @xmath97 and @xmath274 .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath100 in [ eq : sign - int ] , once squared ( because the finkelstein terms are quadratic in @xmath66 ) , makes the sign of the interaction term for bosons and fermions the same .    for discussing the diffusive term @xmath275 , notice that by rewriting @xmath276 we again identify it with the fermionic saddle point @xmath277 , but now the off - diagonal elements have extra factors @xmath278 .",
    "these factors will cancel each other in the expansion of the quadratic in @xmath66 diffusive term , and hence can be dropped , and once again the fermionic saddle expansion can be used .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath100 has the effect of changing @xmath279 ."
