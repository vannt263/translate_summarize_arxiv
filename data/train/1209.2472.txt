    "recent years have made it clear that even at loop level perturbative scattering amplitudes in gravity theories are closely related to corresponding ones in gauge theories .",
    "in particular , a recent conjecture holds that whenever a duality between color and kinematics is made manifest , the integrands of ( super)gravity loop amplitudes can be obtained immediately from corresponding gauge - theory ones  @xcite . it has been clear since the original loop - level double - copy construction that it would have important implications for resolving long - standing questions on the ultraviolet properties of gravity theories . an obvious question is whether it can be used to show that @xmath5  @xcite and other supergravity theories have a tamer than expected ultraviolet behavior .",
    "if each order of the perturbative expansion were finite , it would imply a deep new structure of the theory .",
    "the double - copy structure has been used to simplify new nontrivial calculations of the ultraviolet properties of supergravity amplitudes , demonstrating behavior remarkably similar to corresponding gauge - theory amplitudes . in explicit calculations of amplitudes",
    "one can , of course , directly confirm that the conjectured duality and double - copy properties hold .",
    "for example , through at least four loops , the ultraviolet divergences of @xmath5 supergravity in the critical dimension where they first occur are proportional to divergences appearing in the subleading - color terms of corresponding @xmath6 super - yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the double - copy construction also played a key role in a recent computation showing that all three - loop four - point amplitudes in @xmath6 supergravity in @xmath7  @xcite are ultraviolet finite  @xcite , contrary to expectations based on the availability of an apparently supersymmetric and duality invariant @xmath8 counterterm  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the double - copy construction to explain ultraviolet finiteness in a simpler example : the four- and five - point two - loop potential divergences in @xmath2 half - maximal supergravity  @xcite .",
    "we directly link the finiteness of the half - maximal supergravity four- and five - point amplitudes at one loop in @xmath0 and at two loops in @xmath1 to ultraviolet cancellations of forbidden color factors in gauge - theory amplitudes .",
    "this can be understood in terms of generalized gauge invariance  @xcite , which links the symmetries and cancellations of gauge theory to those of gravity .",
    "we note that the absence of the potential @xmath2 two - loop four - point divergence has been seen from string - theory calculations as well , so it offers a good way to expose cancellations in the theory  @xcite .    at present there does not appear to be an argument restricting counterterms using the conventional symmetries of the theory to rule out this divergence .",
    "indeed as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the counterterm appears to be expressible as a duality invariant full superspace integral of a density ( which itself is not duality invariant )",
    ". it would be very important to fully understand the extent to which duality symmetry and supersymmetry by themselves can shed light on counterterm restrictions in half - maximal supergravity at two loops in @xmath2 .",
    "some cases we study here are especially simple to analyze because the @xmath6 super - yang - mills amplitudes used on one side of the double - copy construction have diagrammatic numerators that are independent of loop momenta . because of this property , even after performing the loop integration ,",
    "the corresponding amplitudes in pure supergravity theories with sixteen or more supercharges are simple linear combinations of corresponding gauge - theory amplitudes  @xcite . indeed , using the double - copy construction , in ref .",
    "@xcite one - loop four- and five - point and two - loop four - point gravity amplitudes were expressed directly in terms of certain subleading - color amplitudes of corresponding gauge theories . there",
    "the authors found cancellations leading to the relatively mild infrared singularities in gravity , similar to the way we find tamer ultraviolet behavior in gravity than in the gauge - theory amplitudes from which they are built .    besides the double - copy relation between gravity and gauge theory , there are other reasons to believe that the ultraviolet behavior of gravity might be better than expected from applying standard symmetry arguments .",
    "even pure einstein gravity at one loop exhibits remarkable cancellations as the number of external legs increases , essentially scaling with the number of external legs in the same way as gauge theory  @xcite . through unitarity ,",
    "such cancellations feed into nontrivial ultraviolet cancellations at all loop orders  @xcite .",
    "very recently , resummations of @xmath9 supergravity amplitudes were shown to have surprisingly good behavior in the high - energy regge limit  @xcite , suggestive of a connection to the surprisingly good ultraviolet behavior of loop amplitudes in these theories .",
    "whether the observed cancellations are sufficient to render the theory ultraviolet finite remains an open question .",

    "interestingly , the candidate full - superspace integral for the counterterm turns out to vanish  @xcite , leaving only a bps candidate counterterm represented by an integral over @xmath11 of the superspace .",

    "@xcite , we see that arguments based on applying the known symmetries of supergravity theories can be misleading .",
    "it is therefore important to carry out explicit computations to guide future studies . in particular",
    ", the arguments suggesting a seven - loop divergence in @xmath7 also suggest that in higher dimensions , @xmath5 supergravity will be worse behaved than @xmath6 super - yang - mills theory starting at five loops due to the availability of a @xmath12 counterterm",
    ". it should be possible to test this by direct computation  @xcite .",
    "besides explaining the nontrivial cancellation of two - loop four - point divergences in half - maximal supergravity in @xmath2 , we also present the explicit forms of one - loop four- and five - point divergences in @xmath3 and two - loop four - point divergences in @xmath4 .",
    "we obtain these using the same double - copy construction as used to demonstrate the vanishing of all three - loop divergences of @xmath6 supergravity in @xmath7  @xcite . in this construction , one copy is a maximally supersymmetric yang - mills amplitude in a form in which the duality between color and kinematics holds manifestly  @xcite , while the second copy uses ordinary feynman rules in feynman gauge .",

    ", we briefly review some basic features of the duality between color and kinematics and the double - copy construction of gravity . in",
    ", we show that at four and five points the potential one - loop divergences in half - maximal supergravity cancel in @xmath0 by linking them to forbidden divergences in corresponding gauge - theory amplitudes .",
    "we also present the explicit form of one - loop divergences in @xmath3 . then in we show that the two - loop four- and five - point amplitudes of half - maximal supergravity do not have divergences in @xmath1 .",

    "these results are used in to explicitly demonstrate ultraviolet cancellations in the corresponding half - maximal supergravity amplitude .",
    "in this section we review the duality between color and kinematics conjectured by carrasco , johansson and one of the authors ( bcj ) and the related double - copy construction of gravity loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these properties underlie our ability to analyze the divergence structure of half - maximal supergravity amplitudes .",
    "recent applications to the half - maximal theory of @xmath6 supergravity in @xmath7 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      we can write any @xmath13-point @xmath14-loop gauge - theory amplitude with all particles in the adjoint representation as @xmath15 the sum labeled by @xmath16 runs over the set of distinct non - isomorphic @xmath13-point @xmath14-loop graphs with only cubic ( i.e. trivalent ) vertices .",

    "@xcite states that to all loop orders there should exist a form of the amplitude where kinematic numerators satisfy the same algebraic relations as color factors . for yang - mills theory",

    "@xcite , the numerator relations are functional equations . for four - point tree amplitudes such relations were noticed long ago  @xcite . beyond the four - point tree level ,",

    "once the gauge - theory amplitudes have been arranged into the form ( [ loopgauge ] ) where the numerators satisfy the duality ( [ bcjduality ] ) , the corresponding gravity loop integrands become remarkably simple to obtain  @xcite via the replacement , @xmath27 the @xmath28 are diagram numerators from a second gauge theory .",
