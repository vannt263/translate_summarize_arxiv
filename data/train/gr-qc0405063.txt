    "the theory of stellar oscillations has been a fundamental tool in the study of stellar interiors and stellar properties during decades . for newtonian stars the theory is well established and observationally tested . in some areas such as helioseismology ,",
    "very high precision measurements of the normal oscillation frequencies allow for a detailed understanding of the properties of the solar interior ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is usually assumed that stellar pulsations are adiabatic because the thermal relaxation timescale in stellar interiors is orders of magnitude larger than the pulsation periods .",
    "however , in some particular situations , energy transfer in the external regions of stars is fast enough to affect the pulsation properties , and some work has been devoted to study , for example , non - adiabatic oscillations of white dwarfs @xcite or the coupling between the different non - linear modes in non ",
    "adiabatic situations @xcite .",
    "concerning relativistic stars , the study of pulsation properties of neutron stars or compact objects such as strange stars or hybrid stars has become more popular in the last decade ( see e.g. the reviews in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , mainly due to the expectations of detecting the gravitational emission from pulsating nearby compact stars with the current or next generation ground - based interferometric detectors ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama ) .",
    "the theory of non - adiabatic relativistic stellar pulsations is not as well developed as its newtonian cousin , due the higher complexity of the formalisms , but also due to the fact that most attention has been paid to the study of old neutron stars , in which the thermal conductivity is too small to have visible non - adiabatic effects .",
    "nevertheless , there might be situations in which this is not entirely true .",
    "for example , in a newly born neutron star the thermal structure is determined by neutrino diffusion @xcite , instead of electron conduction as in old neutron stars @xcite , and the effects of non - adiabaticity are likely to be relevant in the outer layers .",
    "another interesting possibility is the existence of deconfined quark matter in neutron star cores , or in the form of strange stars .",
    "there seems to be common agreement in that , if strange matter exists , it has to be in a color superconducting phase .",
    "it has been recently pointed out @xcite that the thermal conductivity of such exotic matter is many orders of magnitude larger than in normal neutron star matter , and for sufficiently high temperatures the timescale for thermal relaxation can be as short as @xmath5 s. , comparable with typical oscillation periods of compact objects . if this or other exotic scenarios ( hyperons , kaon condensates ) happen to be true , our common belief that compact star pulsations are adiabatic",
    "must be modified , and some care must be taken to understand how non - adiabatic effects change the oscillation properties and therefore the predicted gravitational wave signals of pulsating compact stars .    with this motivation , we have derived a formalism that includes the effects of heat transfer and chemical diffusion ( important in proto - neutron stars , where lepton diffusion is the driving force of thermodynamical changes ) in a relativistic analysis of stellar perturbations .",
    "some work in this line has been done in the past for radial oscillations @xcite .",
    "we have considered the case of non - radial oscillations , since this is the case of interest for gravitational wave emission , by extending in a simple way the formalism of lindblom and detweiler @xcite , and complementing the system of equations in the frequency domain with the additional equations for thermal or chemical diffusion . in the present study we focused on the effects of heat transfer and chemical diffusion , neglecting the rotation of the star .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the equations of non - adiabatic stellar perturbations in general relativity . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the equation of state we have used and we define the thermodynamical quantities we need in our derivation .",
    "the additional equations ( transport of energy ) that close the system are discussed in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the numerical implementation of the complete set of equations . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss in detail the results of the numerical integrations and in sec .",
    "vii we draw the main conclusions and comment on possible future extensions of this work .",

    "hereafter , we will neglect the heat flux in the background configuration .",
    "this is justified if the background is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium . even in the case",
    "that thermal or chemical gradients are present , the assumption of stationary background is valid if the timescale for global thermodynamical changes is much larger than the timescale of variation of the perturbations .",
    "for example , in newly born neutron stars , structural changes happen on timescales of the order of 0.1 - 1 second , while we are interested in oscillations of periods of the order of milliseconds .",

    "lm&=&-e^/2r^-ls_lm.[xesy ]    at this point , we already can see that the presence of the new dissipative terms affects the resulting equations in two main ways .",

    "second , the thermodynamical relation between the pressure and the energy density is now more complex because the equation of state ( eos ) is not only a function of the energy density , but also of the entropy , say , @xmath18 . for clarity , we will discuss the above points separately .",
    "the new terms appearing in the perturbed equations can be greatly simplified by working in a suitable reference frame . introducing the four  velocity of an observer in the frame in which the _ energy _ ( as opposed to the _ matter _ ) is at rest u_u_+,[defhatu ] then , the stress  energy tensor ( [ pertt ] ) has formally the expression of the perfect fluid case : t_=(+p)u_u_+pg_+pg_+ ( u_u_+u_u_).[standardtmunu ] accordingly , we can redefine the original variables of lindblom & detweiler in the following way : w_lm&&w_lm + e^-/2[wh ] + v_lm&&v_lm -[vh ] + x_lm&&x_lm -e^/2-[xh ] + e_lm&&e_lm -e^/2- , [ eh ] and now the harmonic expansions of @xmath19 and of the thermodynamical quantities are also formally identical to those in the perfect fluid case : u^&=&(-e^-/2h_0lmy^lm , w_lmy^lm , -v_lm^aby_,b^lm)r^le^t + & & + x_lm&= & -e^/2(r^-lp_lm + w_lmp^(0 ) ) + e_lm&= & -e^/2(r^-l_lm + w_lm^(0 ) ) .",

    "we must notice , however , that the non  causal newtonian theory has been used for years in the study of non  relativistic stars with remarkable success , and with observational confirmation .",

    "the damping times we compute take for the first time into account both mechanisms in a self  consistent manner , by including the appropriate physics in the equations . in the semitransparent regime ,",
    "when diffusion is more effective , we must expect short - lived , strongly damped , gw signals , more similar to a gw burst than a proper @xmath88 khz oscillation lasting for several hundred oscillations .",
    "notice , however , that if the physical conditions are such that the thermal relaxation timescale becomes shorter than the oscillation period , thermal damping does not affect much the damping time , being the only remarkable difference a shift in the oscillation frequency .",
    "let us now focus on the fundamental mode .",
    "the @xmath89mode is a global oscillation mode that depends essentially on the average density of the star , rather than on the velocity at which acoustic waves propagate .",
    "in fact , it is well known that an incompressible fluid ( infinite speed of sound ) does not have @xmath3modes but the frequency of the @xmath89mode is similar to that of a realistic star with the same average density . for these reasons ,",
    "one expects similar results to those of the @xmath3mode but with smaller effects on the shifts of frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ figf ] we show our results for the @xmath89mode , when this is clearly visible .",
    "now , the shift in frequency is only of a few hz , and the effect on the damping time is also smaller , although in the semitransparent regime , it can be as much as a factor 2.5 smaller than that of the adiabatic case ( 0.25 s ) .",
    "analogously to what happened for the @xmath3mode , once we enter in the isothermal regime , thermal damping is less effective and the damping time becomes quite similar to the adiabatic value .",
    "one must keep in mind that these results depend on the particular details of the eos , or more precisely , on the temperature and specific heat . in cases with higher temperatures and",
    "lower specific heat , the frequency of the fundamental mode could be quite different from the adiabatic case .",
    "it remains to be analyzed what are the quantitative differences for realistic models at different stages of neutron star evolution , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , let us discuss the @xmath4modes . in fig .",
    "[ figg ] we show the results for the first gravity mode , which in the adiabatic case has a frequency of 364 hz and a damping time of thousands of seconds .",
    "the existence of these modes is related to the presence of thermal ( or chemical ) gradients in the star , therefore it is not surprising that as we increase the thermal conductivity and , consequently , heat interchange between displaced fluid elements is more effective , the @xmath4mode frequencies decrease and the damping time increases .",
    "contrary to what happens with the acoustic and fundamental modes , in the limit of infinite thermal conductivity the @xmath4modes degenerate at zero frequency .",
    "it is interesting to note that the damping time does not decrease indefinitely as the mean free path increases , being bounded by the minimum dissipative timescale that is , again , close to the estimate of eq .",
    "[ ediss ] ( of the order of ms ) , in our scenario .",
    "the last important difference with the other modes is that for values of @xmath78 as low as @xmath90 km , although the change in frequency is small , the damping time is sensibly shorter ( 0.01 s ) . for the @xmath89 or @xmath3modes",
    "it was needed to have higher values of @xmath78 to obtain significant differences with respect to the adiabatic damping time .",
    "in this paper we have developed the formalism to study non - radial oscillations of relativistic stars in the frequency domain giving one step forward from the perfect fluid case by including the effects of thermal diffusion in a fully relativistic formalism .",
    "this allows us to understand one of the non ",
    "adiabatic processes ( we did not consider viscosity ) that may be relevant in the study of the oscillation properties of newly born neutron stars , strange stars , or neutron stars with deconfined quark matter in the core ( hybrid stars ) . when a general equation of state that depends on temperature is used , the perturbations of the fluid result in perturbations of temperature ( or chemical composition ) and , consequently , in heat flux ( or chemical diffusion ) , that is coupled with the geometry through the einstein field equations .",
    "we have analyzed separately the @xmath3modes , the fundamental mode and the @xmath4modes , each one being affected in a different way by thermal diffusion . as expected from a simplified model discussed in appendix [ toy ] , the @xmath3mode frequency",
    "is shifted to lower values in a factor roughly proportional to the ratio between the _ isothermal _ and _ adiabatic _ speeds of sound @xmath91 , thus depending very much on the eos employed and the values of the local temperature .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath89mode , however , is barely affected because it is a global oscillation mode that does not depend much on the local value of the speed of sound .",
    "both @xmath89 and @xmath3modes are more efficiently damped in the semitransparent regime , when the mean free path of the particles responsible of the heat transfer is smaller , but close to the typical length scale of the system .",
    "the reason is that once the timescale to reach thermal equilibrium becomes shorter than the oscillation period , the fluid oscillates keeping the temperature constant , and further increasing the thermal conductivity does not change this situation . in this limit",
    ", there is no additional thermal damping at first order ( as shown in appendix [ toy ] ) , so that the damping times in the adiabatic and isothermal limits are very similar .",
    "the response of the @xmath4modes to heat transfer is quite different .",
    "since these modes exist because of the presence of thermal gradients , it is naturally found that , as heat transfer becomes more effective , and the temperature perturbations are smeared out , the frequency is shifted to lower values and the damping time becomes shorter . in the isothermal limit",
    "the @xmath4modes have degenerated to zero frequency .    in this first approach to the problem",
    ", we have only presented results about the effects of heat transfer .",
    "it must be remarked that in newly born neutron stars the effects of lepton diffusion are also important , and in appendix [ nm ] we discuss the relevant equations to study that case .",
    "the coupling between thermal and chemical diffusion is one of the complications that arise if one wants to study the realistic case of proto  neutron stars a few seconds after birth , but there is a second one . in this early stage",
    "the background gradients of temperature and chemical potential are important , and in some cases , or for some of the modes , the overall evolution timescale may become similar to the characteristic oscillation periods or damping times . furthermore , proto  neutron stars are expected to rotate fastly , while in the present work we focused on thermal effects neglecting rotation .",
    "we defer for future work a more rigorous study of the realistic scenario , that must consider the non  trivial issue of coupling between rotational and thermal effects .",
    "this must probably be done in the time domain instead of the frequency domain , or including second order terms .",
    "our results can also be directly applied to another interesting case : hot strange stars in which quark matter is in a color superconductor state . as discussed in the paper",
    ", this appears to be the natural state of deconfined quark matter , and recent calculations show that the thermal conductivities are many orders of magnitude larger than those of standard neutron star matter . in this latter scenario , if the strange star is born after the mini ",
    "collapse of an old , evolved neutron star that has been accreting matter , the initial lepton content is small , and the effects of thermal diffusion are the dominant non  adiabatic correction .",
    "we are indebted to j.a .",

    "integrating in time the continuity equation gives @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , and substituting @xmath94 in the momentum equation leads to = - p_1 = - _ 1 = c_s^2 ^2 [ mom1 ] which is a simple wave equation that , when we consider perturbations of the form @xmath95 gives the dispersion equation : - ^2 + k^2 c_s^2 = 0 .",

    "( [ mom3 ] ) one obtains = c_s^2 ^2 + ( ) _ s ^4 + ^2 .",

    "it must be remarked that in the isothermal limit , the solution is always real ( no damping ) , and @xmath105 acquires an imaginary part only in the intermediate regime .",
    "notice also that dissipation is most effective for modes at short wavelengths ( large @xmath106 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fappendix ] we show the solutions of the dispersion equation ( [ disp1 ] ) as a function of the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the oscillation frequency ( normalized to @xmath108 ) is represented by the solid line , and the inverse damping time by the dashed line .",
    "the qualitative behaviour is very similar to the results discussed in the text .",
    "the ratio of the the limiting frequencies depends on the ratio @xmath91 . for this example , we have taken @xmath109 .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "the dispersion relation can be written as ^3 + a_2 ^2 + a_1 _ 1 + a_0 = 0 a_2 = d  ,   a_1 = c_s^2  ,   a_0 = d c_t^2 where @xmath110 .",
    "the condition that at least one of the roots has a positive real part ( unstable ) is equivalent to one of the following inequalities a_2 < 0 , a_0 < 0 , a_1 a_2 < a_0 .",
    "since all coefficients are positive defined , only the third condition could apply .",
    "it is simply c_s^2 < c_t^2 which is generally not the case , for reasonable realistic eoss .",
    "in order to study non - adiabatic perturbations in proto - neutron stars , we need to generalize our equations to the case when both , energy flux and particle number flux due to neutrino diffusion are present . in this appendix",
    "we derive the equations in a similar way as it was done in the main body of the paper for the case with only heat transfer .",
    "we choose as independent thermodynamical variables the pressure @xmath0 , the entropy per baryon @xmath34 , and the lepton fraction @xmath111 , with @xmath10 being baryon number density and @xmath112 the lepton number density .",
    "given these three thermodynamical quantities , the eos gives the rest of variables .",
    "in particular , the eos provides n = n(p , s , y_l )  = ( p , s , y_l ) .",
    "the reason for taking @xmath113 as the extensive variable describing the chemical composition is the following .",
    "the work associated with a variation of chemical composition at constant entropy is _",
    "i_idy_i . here ,",
    "@xmath114 , and @xmath115 are the chemical potentials and number densities of the specie @xmath116 , respectively . in our case ,",
    "the process that changes the chemical composition is the capture of electrons by protons and its reciprocal ( inverse @xmath53 decay ) e+p n+ , so that chemical equilibrium results in @xmath117 .",
    "since only neutrinos can diffuse throughout the star , we also have @xmath118 , while @xmath119 is independent from the others . consequently , _ i_idy_i=(_e+_p-_n)dy_e+_dy_= _ ( dy_e+dy_)=_dy_l . notice that in this system the variable conjugate to @xmath113 is @xmath120 .    according to this result , the first principle of thermodynamics",
    "( see for example @xcite ) takes the form d = dn+ntds+n_dy_l.[first ] analogously , since we use @xmath121 as independent variables , we can write , in place of ( [ relalpha ] ) , d = c_s^-2dp+nt_1 ds+n__2dy_l[drho ] where the sound speed @xmath36 is defined by c_s^2()_s , y_l .",
    "and we have defined the following thermodynamical derivatives : _",
    "1()_p , y_l  ,   _ 2 ( ) _ p , s .",
    "we also define _",
    "3()_p , s= ( ) _ p , y_l where the last equality can be easily proved from maxwell relations .",
    "let us now consider the heat function @xmath122 q= tds + _",
    "i_idy_i = tds+_dy_l .",
    "then , we define ( ) _ p , y_l&=&t()_p , y_l c_p + ( ) _ p , s&= & _ ( ) _ p , s _",
    "p , where @xmath45 is the specific heat at constant pressure and constant number fraction , @xmath123 is a coefficient describing the heat associated to a change in composition at constant entropy and pressure .",
    "with all the above definitions , and using the first law of thermodynamics , the expressions of @xmath124 and @xmath125 in terms of @xmath126 can be written as dt&=&ds+(1-_1)dp+_3 dy_l[dt ] + d_&=&dy_l + ( 1-_2)dp+_3 ds.[dmu ] equations ( [ drho ] ) , ( [ dt ] ) , and ( [ dmu ] ) allow us to express the perturbations of density , temperature and chemical potentials in terms of the independent variables .",
    "similar relations apply for the gradients of the background quantities .",
    "for example , from ( [ drho ] ) & = & c_s^-2p+nt_1s+n__2 y_l[deltarho ] + ^(0)&=&c_s^-2p^(0)+nt_1s^(0 ) + n__2y_l^(0)[rhoprime ] and the same applies for @xmath127 .",
    "next , we need to generalize eckart dissipative thermodynamics to the case when also chemical diffusion , ( lepton diffusion in this case ) is present .",
    "therefore , we need to consider the lepton conservation equation ( n y_eu^+ n y_(u^+n^))_;=0 , where @xmath128 is the neutrino four  velocity with respect to the frame comoving with matter ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , with @xmath129 and @xmath130 . defining the neutrino flux as @xmath131 , that satisfies @xmath132 , and using the continuity equation ( [ cont ] )",
    "we obtain the equation of lepton conservation @xmath133 .",
    "this latter equation is particularized for lepton diffusion , which is relevant for nascent neutron stars , but it is a general conservation equation for massless particles .",
