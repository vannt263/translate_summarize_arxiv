    "through studying jet production at the @xmath3 collider , hera , a wide variety of fundamental measurements are possible , such as the determination of the strong coupling constant , @xmath4 , or information on the gluon content of the photon . to make the measurements as significant as possible , jets have to be reconstructed , optimising the energy resolution and minimising the uncertainty of the absolute energy scale .",
    "the accurate reconstruction of jets at the zeus experiment generally relies on the precise determination of energies and angles of hits in the uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal)@xcite . before reaching the cal",
    ", particles pass through approximately one radiation length of dead material in the central region of the detector mainly due to the solenoid magnet between the tracking detector and the cal .",
    "the modelling of the energy lost by particles traversing the solenoid plays the most significant rle in understanding the absolute energy scale between data and mc .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the energy scale of high - energy scattered positrons in the central part of the cal is understood to within 1@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the hadronic energy scale ( i.e. the energy carried by particles in the neutral current ( nc ) final state , excluding the scattered positron ) is known to within 2@xmath0 , of which 1@xmath0 comes from the uncertainty of the positron measurement .",
    "the uncertainty when specifically studying jet production ( jets in the range of transverse energy , @xmath5 gev ) is not the same as the hadronic energy scale because the choice of algorithm and modelling of the jet structure can affect the result . the absolute energy scale uncertainty for jet production is currently known to within 3@xmath0@xcite , which contributes a roughly 15@xmath0 error on a jet cross section measurement , due to the steeply falling @xmath6 distribution .",
    "this article describes a method capable of reducing the jet energy scale uncertainty to @xmath7 as for the case of the electromagnetic and hadronic energy scale uncertainties .",
    "first , the reconstruction of energy flow objects ( efos ) is introduced , which optimise the use of tracking and cal information .",
    "then , a method is outlined which exploits energy and momentum conservation in a high purity sample of nc events to correct the cal - efos for energy loss in the dead material of the detector .",
    "the use of efos has been shown to improve the reconstruction of kinematic quantities@xcite .",
    "clusters of cells are formed and combined with tracks originating from the primary vertex . in general , for low momentum particles ,",
    "tracks provide a better measurement of the energy , whereas the cal is better for high momentum particles . in the case of clusters",
    "not matched to a track ( from , for example , neutral particles ) or tracks not matched to a cluster ( where the particle momentum is so small that it does not reach the cal ) , the situation is clear .",
    "however , for clusters and tracks considered matched ( or even many tracks matched to one cluster , etc . ) , a decision has to be made concerning which quantity ( or quantities ) to use . for a matched cluster - track system ,",
    "the resolutions and ratio of energy to momentum are considered in the decision - making process . using this procedure ,",
    "a list of track - efos and cal - efos is obtained .",
    "the track - efos are assumed to be an accurate measurement of the particle energy , whereas the cal - efos are subject to energy - loss in the dead material in front of the cal and must be corrected .",
    "the conservation of energy and momentum in nc events can be exploited to determine the cal - efo energy - correction functions by balancing the momentum of the scattered positron with that of the hadronic final state . using a method similar to that detailed below",
    ", the uncertainty in the zeus jet energy - scale has already been determined to within 3@xmath0@xcite . in order to reduce this uncertainty , the form of the function for energy loss , improving",
    "the samples of events chosen and using a larger data sample have been studied@xcite .",
    "two samples of events with high momentum transfer , @xmath8 gev@xmath9 , were used to provide full angular coverage of the detector .",
    "a sample of events with high positron @xmath10 and a sample of events at high effective longitudinal momentum , @xmath11 , were used .",
    "the kinematic variables of the positron were reconstructed using the double angle method@xcite , which , to first order , is independent of the absolute energy scale of the cal .",
    "the hadronic final state four - vector was calculated from the efos reconstructed as above and its momentum components balanced with that of the scattered positron .",
    "each correction for the cal - efos were parametrised as a function of energy .",
    "there parameters were determined for several bins of polar angle , @xmath12 , ( reflecting the detector geometry ) , by minimisation of the following quantity :    @xmath13   + \\sum_{\\rm sample \\ 2 } min \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{y^{\\rm da } - y^{\\rm had } }                                                  { y^{\\rm da } } \\right)^2 , 0.2 ^ 2 \\right]}.\\ ] ]    the minimisation was performed using the minuit package@xcite and correction factors obtained separately for data and mc .",
    "the difference between data and mc may arise from inadequate detail in the description of the dead material in front of the cal and an inaccurate simulation of the hadronic energy loss process .",
    "the cal clusters were corrected for energy loss using the functional form , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cluster energy and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the correction factors to be determined in each angular region .",
    "the result of the fits for both data and herwig mc@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fitfunc ] .",
    "it can be seen that the data and mc show similar trends but differ in detail , justifying the need to perform the fits and apply the corrections separately for data and mc .",
    "to test the validity of the factors obtained , the correction functions were applied to an independent photoproduction mc sample , where the scattered positron is not detected in the cal .",
    "jet quantities were reconstructed using both efos with and without correction and the transverse energy , @xmath18 , compared to the `` true '' hadron - level , @xmath19 as shown in fig .",
    "[ ethad ] .",
    "before the efos are corrected , the deviation from the true value is roughly @xmath20 as shown in fig .",
    "[ ethad]b . after correction , as in fig .",
    "[ ethad]a , the transverse energies are significantly closer to the true values , demonstrating that the energy correction helps to reproduce the true quantities when applied to an independent mc sample . the extent to which hadron - level quantities in the data are reproduced and the size of the resulting energy scale uncertainty can be determined by comparing the correction in data and mc separately .       the results of applying the corrections to the same data and mc used to obtain the factors is shown in fig .",
    "[ etjet ] . here , instead of the @xmath10 of the hadronic final state , the transverse energy of the jet , @xmath21 , which takes into account the extra uncertainties due to jet reconstruction and",
    "is closely related to @xmath22 , is considered . as a function of the pseudorapidity of the jet , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 $ ] ) , the data and mc agree to within roughly @xmath25 .",

    "a method has been developed for correcting for energy lost in the dead material in front of the zeus calorimeter .",
    "the procedure relies on a combination of tracking and cal information .",
