    "the classical constituent quark models are based on the assumption of three constituent quarks inside each baryon .",
    "they are very successful for the spatial ground state of baryons , but have serious problems for the predictions of baryon excitation states .",
    "the lowest excitation of baryons is expected to be the orbital angular momentum @xmath13 excitation of a quark , resulting to spin - parity @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the lowest @xmath14 baryons from many experiments  @xcite . there is a question that why the mass of @xmath16 is much less than @xmath15 .",
    "it is very difficult to explain this problem in the classical @xmath18-quark models , because the @xmath16 with @xmath19-quarks is obviously expected to be heavier than @xmath15 with @xmath20-quarks .",
    "another problem is about the @xmath21 asymmetry in the proton with the number of @xmath22 more than @xmath23 by an amount @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "if one wants to solve these problems , one should put the @xmath25 components in the baryons .",
    "the unquenched models give the good explanation to these problems .",
    "for example , in the penta - quark models  @xcite , the mass of @xmath15 with mainly a @xmath26[us]\\bar s$ ] state is heavier than @xmath16 with mainly a @xmath26[sq]\\bar q$ ] state with @xmath27 .",
    "the 5-quark models may play an important role in the baryon spectroscopy .",
    "these unquenched models give many new predictions besides the properties of @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the penta - quark models  @xcite show a new physical picture for the baryonic excitation .",
    "the lowest excitation is @xmath1 in the @xmath28 model , and there are two new particles @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are absent in the @xmath31 model .",
    "the meson cloud model  @xcite predicts them to be non - resonant broad structures .",
    "these new predictions are all very different from the results of the classical quenched quark models , so it needs to be checked by experiments .    possible existence of such new @xmath32 structure in @xmath33 decays was pointed out earlier  @xcite and is going to be investigated by the starting bes3 experiment  @xcite , and we also re - examined the old data of @xmath34 reaction at @xmath35 gev to find some evidence for its existence  @xcite . in this paper by using the results from the fit of experimental data in the ref .",
    "@xcite , we show further evidence for the existence of such @xmath32 in the @xmath36 reaction at @xmath37 gev , with a very clear peak of @xmath5 in the energy dependence of the total cross section  @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we present the formalism and ingredients for the study of the @xmath4   reaction by including various feynman diagrams . in the last section , our numerical results , comparision with the experimental data , and conclusions are given .",
    "in this section we present the formalism and ingredients for the analysis of @xmath38 in the energy region around the @xmath39 .",
    "first , the corresponding feynman diagrams , s - channel @xmath40 exchange diagram ( a ) , u - channel @xmath41 exchange diagram ( b ) , t - channel @xmath42 exchange diagram ( c ) , t - channel @xmath42 and @xmath41 exchange diagram ( d ) , t - channel @xmath42 and @xmath9 exchange diagram ( e ) , and u - channel @xmath41 and @xmath43 exchange diagram ( f ) , for the reaction ( [ kp ] ) are depicted in fig . [ fe ] .     reaction . ]    besides we give the effective lagrangian densities for describing the interaction vertices in fig .",
    "they can be written as    @xmath44    here @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the kaon , nucleon and @xmath10 masses ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are rarita - schwinger fields for @xmath2 and @xmath39 of spin-3/2 particles ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath10 are the spin - half fields for the @xmath52 , n(938 ) and @xmath53 particles ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 are scalar fields for the pion and kaon ; @xmath56 is a usual isospin-@xmath57 pauli matrix operator ; the relevant interaction coupling constants , obtained by using the above effective lagrangians to fit relevant decay widths or from literature , are all listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".parameters used in our calculation .",
    "widths and branching ratios are from pdg  @xcite ; the mass and width of @xmath58 are @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 gev , respectively  @xcite ; for ( a ) and ( b ) we use @xmath61 , while assuming that all @xmath62 come from @xmath63 in the @xmath64 reaction . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     furthermore , we need also the propagators of resonant particles to calculate feynman diagrams . for the @xmath55 and @xmath65 mesons ,",
    "the propagators are : @xmath66 for the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryon resonances the propagators can be written as @xcite : @xmath67 the role of @xmath5 is very important , thus we take into account that the width @xmath68 of the @xmath5 is dependent on its four - momentum squared , and by straightforward calculation we obtain the following expression for the @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and where @xmath71 are the magnitudes of the three momenta of the @xmath55 and @xmath54 mesons ; @xmath72 are the decay widths for the processes @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are the corresponding amplitudes ; @xmath77 is the phase space of @xmath78 decays into @xmath62 ; the form factor @xmath79 and blatt - weisskopf centrifugal barrier factor @xmath80 are given in eqs.([ff1 ] ) and ( [ bl ] ) , respectively ; the parameter @xmath81 stands for the proportion of @xmath82 in the @xmath12 .",
    "since the baryons and mesons are not point - like particles we need to consider the form factors for each interaction vertices in order to calculate amplitudes for the reaction .",
    "therefore now we give the form factors for every feynman diagram .",
    "for the fig.[fe](a ) , we use the following form factors @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 or @xmath12 ) @xcite . because both the @xmath78 and @xmath12 are almost on - shell , the contribution of these form factors are unimportant . in addition",
    ", we also use the following p - wave and d - wave blatt - weisskopf barrier form factors for the vertices of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 with @xmath90 here @xmath91 is a hadron scale parameter in the unit of gev / c with r the radius of the centrifugal barrier in the unit of fm . in our calculation",
    "we set @xmath92 .",
    "we find that these two form factors have negligible effect on our results , thus one may conclude that fig.[fe](a ) is almost model independent .    for the figs.[fe](b , c ) , we use eq.([bl ] ) for the @xmath87 vertex , and eq.([ff1 ] ) for the off - shell baryon resonance @xmath82 with cut - off parameter @xmath93 gev for @xmath65 exchange and @xmath41 exchange .    for the figs.[fe](d , e , f ) , we also use the form factor in eq.([ff1 ] ) with @xmath93 gev for @xmath65 and @xmath94 exchange diagram , and @xmath95 gev for @xmath41 and @xmath43 exchange diagram .    after fixing the relevant effective lagrangians , coupling constants , propagators and form factors , the amplitudes for various feynman diagrams",
    "can be written down straightforwardly by following the feynman rules , and total amplitude is just their simple sum . here as an example , we give explicitly the individual amplitudes corresponding to @xmath96 and to @xmath97 for the feynman diagrams ( a ) in the fig.[fe ] , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the spin wave functions of the outgoing @xmath10 and incoming proton , respectively ; @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the 4- momenta of the final state pions and initial state @xmath94 meson ; the factor @xmath104 is a isospin c - g coefficient .",
    "so the total amplitude squared for the @xmath4  reaction is @xmath105 note that we do not include the interference terms between different feynman diagrams because their contributions are insignificant .",
    "then the calculation of the cross section for @xmath4is straightforward : @xmath106",
    "with the formalism and ingredients given in the former section , we compute the total cross section versus the @xmath9 beam momentum @xmath107 for the @xmath4  reaction for @xmath37 gev by using the code fowl from the cern program library , which is a program for monte carlo multi - particle phase space integration weighted by the amplitude squared .",
    "we consider two cases , firstly , we assume that the @xmath108 of the @xmath12 is @xmath109 with @xmath110 . on the other hand , we suppose that the @xmath12 with @xmath111 and with @xmath112 account for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "our results on the total cross section for the @xmath4  reaction is almost the same for both cases , because the branching ratio of @xmath116 is @xmath117 for both cases .",
    "total cross section , angular distributions of the final state @xmath10 , and @xmath118 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 invariant mass square distributions , as well as dalitz plots for the final state particles for the two cases of our theoretical calculations , are shown in figs.2 - 7 , with experimental data points from the refs.@xcite .     for the @xmath119 reaction with @xmath115 .",

    "the reason may be the absence of the contribution of @xmath121 or other resonance states .",
    "for the energies larger than 0.42 gev , the contribution of feynman diagram fig.1(b ) becomes large , but the contribution is uncertain because of the large influence of form factor . further detailed study is necessary for this energy range . for the energies from 0.355 to 0.42 gev , the theoretical prediction agrees very well with the experiment , and the main contribution comes from the decay @xmath122 .",
    "therefore the decay @xmath122 is the interesting place to search for the evidence of @xmath58 .",
    "there are quite large differences between the two theoretical invariant mass squared distributions which are shown in figs.[pipi ] , [ lpip ] , [ lpim ] , especially the invariant mass squared spectra of @xmath124 .",
    "one may note that the solid curves with both @xmath82 and @xmath58 contributions give much better agreement with the experiment data .    to understand the reason for the difference",
    ", we show the dalitz plots for the two reaction sequences @xmath125 at @xmath126 in fig.[da ] . from fig.[da ] ( a ) and ( b ) we see that , the contribution of ( [ sig32 ] ) is distributed on the top left corner , but of ( [ sig12 ] ) is in the middle .",
    "this is because for the decay @xmath127 , the final state particles are in the relative s - wave , while for the decay @xmath128 , they are in the relative p - wave with large @xmath129 width . from these dalitz plots ,",
    "one can understand why there is so much difference in the invariant mass squared spectra of @xmath124 .",
    "the experimental analysis in ref.@xcite also considered the contribution of the s - wave of @xmath124 , which may come from @xmath58 , also the @xmath130 from the @xmath131 or @xmath132 , but the range of invariance mass spectrum of @xmath130 is from @xmath133 to @xmath134 gev , which is far from the mass of @xmath131 or @xmath132 . by the investigation we also find that the s - wave final state interaction ( fsi ) of @xmath130 has little influence on the @xmath124 invariant mass squared spectra .",
    "thus we conclude that there should be contribution from the @xmath58 for the reaction at energies around the @xmath5 peak . for the @xmath130 invariance mass spectra",
    ", the inclusion of @xmath114 @xmath58 gives some enhancement to the low energy end and reproduces better the data for @xmath135 center of mass energies around the @xmath5 peak .      in summary",

    "we find that by including @xmath114 @xmath58 contribution the theory agrees much better with the experimental data  @xcite for @xmath107 in the range of @xmath139 gev , corresponding to the @xmath135 center - of - mass energies just under the @xmath39 peak . through the analysis ,",
    "the difference between the two cases , with or without @xmath58 , comes from the different partial waves , namely , s - wave of @xmath140 verus p - wave of @xmath141 from @xmath5 decays , and the different width of the two particles .",
