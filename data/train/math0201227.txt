    "notice that there is always a point in the second order spectrum which approximates the isolated eigenvalue @xmath249 .",
    "we reproduce the coordinates of these points in the forth column of table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "nonetheless some of these values have imaginary part different from zero , in all cases the real part of the approximation of @xmath249 is accurate up to the @xmath309 digit .",
    "this is confirmed by further numerical experiments .    from figures  [ f4 ] and [ f5 ]",
    "we can also say something about the shape of the second order spectra of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath41 is of rank one , roughly speaking @xmath306 should not be too far from the set @xmath310 which is shown in figure  [ f1 ] ( the matrix is tridiagonal and it is not very large so any of the standard computer packages can produce the data for this picture ) .",
    "according to corollary  [ t8 ] the convergence of this sets to the interval @xmath39 $ ] is @xmath311 for all @xmath167 as @xmath312 .",
    "compare with figures  [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] .",
    "notice that in the latter there are some perturbed points very close to the real axis inside the elliptical region which comprises most of the second order spectrum .",
    "further numerical experiments confirm that they increase in number as @xmath305 increases .",
    "their real part are related to the non - real roots of @xmath295 .",
    "these non - real roots of @xmath295 are generalized eigenvalues which according to davies @xcite can be regarded as ( absolute ) resonances of @xmath0 .",
    "it would be interesting to explore further how these resonances are related to @xmath35 .",
    "in figure  [ f2 ] we consider @xmath35 for @xmath313 and @xmath314 as @xmath27 increases .",
    "notice that the convergence to the continuous spectrum seems to be much slower than the convergence to the eigenvalue .",
    "the point @xmath315 which is furthest from @xmath19 seems to have real part approximately equal to @xmath316 .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] is a log - log graph of the imaginary part of @xmath317 when @xmath27 varies from 100 to 1500 .",
    "the slope of the line is very close to -1 .",
    "this suggests that corollary  [ t8 ] fails for @xmath318 . in table",
    "[ tb1 ] , the slope of the line in figure  [ f3 ] changes from test point to test point .",
    "this suggests that the convergence to the spectrum might be of the order @xmath319 for some @xmath320 .",
