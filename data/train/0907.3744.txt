    "one of the most known scalar - tensor theories of gravity is the brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "it describes the scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity with the action @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the brans - dicke parameter and @xmath2 is the lagrangian of matter . in the limit",
    "@xmath3 the theory goes to the standard general relativity .",
    "this theory is very well examined , the present days gravitational experiments set stringent limits on possible values of the brans - dicke parameter @xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a generalization of this theory based on the use of the born - infeld scalar field .",
    "this field itself was widely discussed in the literature , see , for example , @xcite@xcite and references therein .",
    "we will show that such a highly non - linear covariant theory possesses very interesting features and , in principle , it can account for the anomalous acceleration of pioneer  10 and pioneer  11 spacecraft @xcite , leaving the planets of the solar system devoid of such extra constant acceleration which is excluded by observations @xcite .    to this end",
    "let us consider the following four - dimensional action describing born - infeld scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity @xmath4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 .",
    "the action of the scalar field has a non - standard form , but in the limit @xmath6 @xmath7 and ( [ act - bd ] ) transforms into the well - know action of the brans - dicke theory ( [ act - bd-1 ] ) with the brans - dicke parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the theory with action ( [ act - bd ] ) can be considered as a generalized brans - dicke theory .",
    "the extra term @xmath9 in ( [ act - bd ] ) is added to preserve the minkowski background metric in the vacuum state .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath10 is supposed to be @xmath11 .",
    "let us represent the scalar and the gravitational fields as @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the flat minkowski metric , and expand action ( [ act - bd ] ) into series with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the `` gravitational '' part of the action @xmath19 can be represented as @xmath20+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\omega}}\\phi l^{(1)}[h_{\\mu\\nu}]+ \\left(1+\\frac{1}{m_{pl}\\sqrt{\\omega}}\\phi\\right)l^{(2)}[h_{\\mu\\nu}]+ ... \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] is linear in @xmath18 , @xmath22 $ ] is quadratic in @xmath18 and so on .",
    "the born - infeld part of the action @xmath23 can be rewritten as @xmath24 where we have omitted the expansion of @xmath25 .",
    "here and below indices are raised by @xmath26 .",
    "now let us discuss formulas ( [ act - bd22 ] ) and ( [ act - bd23 ] ) .",
    "first , the term @xmath21 $ ] is simply @xmath21=\\partial^{\\mu}\\partial^{\\nu}h_{\\mu\\nu}-\\partial^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}h$ ] ( where @xmath27 ) , which is a total derivative .",
    "thus , the term @xmath28 $ ] vanishes from the action .",
    "second , since we suppose to work in the newtonian approximation , we can drop the term @xmath29 ( as well as higher corrections in @xmath18 ) in comparison with @xmath26 . for these reasons we can also drop the terms @xmath30 $ ] for @xmath31 . as for the term",
    "@xmath32 , it is not evident that it is much smaller than unity .",
    "nevertheless , let us suppose that @xmath33 and drop the term @xmath32 and the subsequent terms in ( [ act - bd23 ] ) , as well as the cubic term @xmath34 $ ] . below we will show that condition @xmath33 indeed holds .",
    "note that we are not able to drop the quadratic term @xmath35 $ ] because it ensures the interaction of born - infeld scalar field with matter .",
    "thus we get @xmath36 + l^{(2)}[h_{\\mu\\nu}]+ f\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{f}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi}\\,+\\right.\\\\ \\nonumber \\left.\\frac{1}{2m_{pl}}h^{\\mu\\nu}t_{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and @xmath38=l_{fp}[h_{\\mu\\nu}]=\\\\ \\nonumber & & -\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\partial_{\\rho}h_{\\mu\\nu}\\partial^{\\rho}h^{\\mu\\nu}- \\partial_{\\rho}h\\partial^{\\rho}h+2\\partial_{\\mu}h^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\nu}h-2\\partial_{\\mu}h^{\\mu\\nu } \\partial^{\\rho}h_{\\rho\\nu}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the standard fierz - pauli lagrangian .",
    "it is convenient to diagonalize action ( [ act ] ) with the help of the standard redefinition @xmath39 after some algebra we get @xmath40+f\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{f}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi } - \\frac{3}{2\\omega}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi+\\\\ \\nonumber \\frac{1}{2m_{pl}}b^{\\mu\\nu}t_{\\mu\\nu}- \\frac{1}{2m_{pl}\\sqrt{\\omega}}\\phi t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "the extra term @xmath42 in ( [ act ] ) has appeared in the action after diagonalization .",
    "the born - infeld part of action ( [ lagr ] ) has the standard form of the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) scalar field action , though the standard dbi lagrangian has a different origin .",
    "it is necessary to note that we take @xmath5 ( like in @xcite ) , contrary to the case @xmath43 , which is often discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be also noted that we neglected the term @xmath9 ( see action ( [ act - bd ] ) ) while obtaining lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the next section .",
    "lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) allows one to examine the stability of the model at least above the minkowski background . to this end",
    "we consider @xmath44 and suppose that @xmath45 .",
    "expanding the square root in ( [ lagr ] ) up to the linear term we get a quadratic lagrangian @xmath46-\\frac{\\omega+3}{2\\omega}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath47 ( this case will be discussed below ) the kinetic term of the scalar field @xmath17 has the proper sign , which leads to the absence of ghosts in the theory .",
    "indeed , for @xmath45 lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) describes the standard brans - dicke theory in the newtonian approximation , which is known to be stable .",
    "higher corrections to ( [ lagr-2q ] ) lead to an infinite tower of self - interaction and interaction terms .",
    "nevertheless , the solution which will be discussed below corresponds to a deep non - linear regime of the born - infeld part of the model where perturbation theory does not work .",
    "it has appeared to be very difficult ( maybe even impossible ) to examine the perturbations around this solution analytically , one should make numerical analysis .",
    "thus , the question about the stability of the solution presented below has no definite answer yet .",
    "the equations of motion following from lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) take the form @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we used de donder gauge condition @xmath51 while obtaining ( [ eq - gr - b ] ) .",
    "we will be interested in the additional interaction between two bodies caused by the scalar field @xmath17 .",
    "as can be seen from initial action ( [ act - bd ] ) , ordinary matter interacts only with the metric , in this sense the weak equivalence principle is fulfilled .",
    "thus the gravitational force acting on a test body can be easily obtained by considering geodesic motion , and in the newtonian limit we get the well - known formula @xmath52 if one considers a non - point - like source , this formula transforms into a formula describing the force acting on the center of mass of the test body @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density of the body of volume @xmath55 such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the vector pointing to the center of mass of the body . using ( [ subst2 ] )",
    "we get the standard newtonian force ( the contribution of @xmath58 ) , and an anomalous force @xmath59 ( the contribution of @xmath17 )",
    ". we will be interested in this anomalous extra force .",
    "now let us turn to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and consider the static case of spherically symmetric bodies .",
    "we suppose that the energy - momentum tensors of the test bodies have the form @xmath60 due to the spherical symmetry @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the radius of the second body .",
    "let us denote @xmath63 .",
    "then eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) for the case of two test bodies takes the form @xmath64    now we are ready to examine the force acting on the test body in such a system .",
    "the coordinate system that will be used for calculations is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig ] . the force will be calculated for the second body ( the right body in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) inside the second body has the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the mass of the first body , @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see fig .  [ fig ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to represent the parameter @xmath72 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a parameter depending on @xmath68 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we can look for a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) using the perturbative approach . after some algebra one can get @xmath77.\\ ] ] for the objects which will be discussed in the next section of the paper the correction in ( [ eq3 - 0 ] ) @xmath78 appears to be at least @xmath79 or even smaller .",
    "thus we can drop this correction and use @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( [ gen - sol ] ) transforms into @xmath82    we can estimate the maximal value of the field @xmath17 itself",
    ". the approximate size of the non - linearity zone is @xmath74 , and @xmath17 can be estimated as @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 a more accurate analysis based on the use of the solutions inside and outside the non - linearity zone ( the latter behaves as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a characteristic distance from both bodies ) , provides an analogous estimate ( up to the factor of the order of unity ) . for the parameters , which will be considered in the next section , @xmath87 and the corresponding terms in ( [ act - bd22 ] ) indeed can be omitted .",
    "now let us estimate the effects that could be produced by the omitted term @xmath9 of action ( [ act - bd ] ) ( see previous section ) . in the non - linearity zone @xmath88 and the term @xmath9 is not compensated .",
    "it indicates that the background metric in the non - linearity zone is not the flat minkowski metric , but a de sitter - like background metric leading to a local expansion .",
    "for the observer , say , on the first body it looks like a repulsive force acting on the second body .",
    "this force has the form @xmath89 which can be easily obtained by considering de sitter metric in the static form @xcite . using ( [ fexp ] )",
    "we get @xmath90 for the values of the parameters that will be used below this force appears to be much smaller than the forces caused by the fields @xmath58 and @xmath17 obeying ( [ eq - gr - b ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) respectively .",
    "thus , for our purposes we can use the minkowski background metric instead of a de sitter - like background metric .",
    "we would like to note that analogous estimates can be obtained if we retain the term @xmath9 in the action and get slightly modified equations for the fields @xmath58 and @xmath17 .",
    "now we turn to the effects which can be produced by the dbi scalar field in our solar system .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath91 which means that @xmath92 ( our `` reduced '' planck mass @xmath93 ) .    in what follows we will consider two cases :    1 .",
    "a light body with the mass @xmath94 , for which @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( for example , a spacecraft like pioneer 10 , 11 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) . in this case in the leading order @xmath99 + it is worth mentioning that there is no such static solution for the case @xmath43 . indeed , if @xmath43 then @xmath100 and we get negative values under the square root ( see eq .",
    "( [ gen - sol ] ) ) , which is the consequence of the existence of a horizon at a finite distance ( see , for example , @xcite , where solutions with horizons in dbi scalar field theory are discussed ) .",
    "that is why we chose the case @xmath5 .",
    "+ substituting the latter formula into ( [ force ] ) and integrating over the volume of the body leads to ( we use the fact that @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the solid angle ) @xmath103 it is necessary to note that in principle @xmath104 but we can neglect possible corrections because anyway @xmath105 see ( [ 19 ] ) . + formula ( [ force-1 ] ) is written in the system of units @xmath106 .",
    "the replacement @xmath107 allows one to pass to the si units , which results in the acceleration towards the sun in the si units @xmath108 we note that this acceleration does not depend on the distance from the sun , which is exactly the situation with the pioneer  10 and pioneer  11 spacecraft @xcite . + as for the bodies on the surface of the earth , we can carry out analogous calculations taking @xmath109 ( in this case @xmath74 also changes ) .",
    "our ideal test bodies with density profile ( [ dens ] ) , ( [ dens1 ] ) on the surface of the earth also possess an additional acceleration @xmath110 towards the center of the planet .",
    "it is evident that this acceleration can be neglected in comparison with @xmath111 for earth - based gravitational experiments .",
    "2 .   heavy bodies with the mass @xmath94 ( planets ) , @xmath112 , @xmath96 . in this case",
    "we should carry out calculations more precisely because @xmath113 and possible corrections due to ( [ neq ] ) can be quite large .",
    "correspondingly , we should take @xmath114 and thus @xmath115 finally we obtain @xmath116\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the latter formula into ( [ force ] ) and integrating over the volume of the body leads to @xmath117 in the si units @xmath118 where @xmath119 one can see that the extra force acting on a heavy body @xmath120 .",
    "such a behavior is inherent to the ordinary brans - dicke theory and we can replace the original potential @xmath17 in ( [ force ] ) by an effective potential @xmath121 . the effective brans - dicke parameter can be easily extracted from ( [ geff ] ) : @xmath122 @xmath123 a significant difference from the original brans - dicke theory is that @xmath124 depends on the mass @xmath94 , i.e. it is different for different planets .",
    "+ to estimate @xmath124 for different planets we suppose that @xmath125 . in this case @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the free fall acceleration on the surface of a body ( a planet ) .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath128 @xmath129 such large values of the brans - dicke parameter do not contradict the experimental bounds @xmath130 obtained in the solar system gravitational tests @xcite ( we would like to note that the bounds on the @xmath131 extra force differ from the bounds on the @xmath132 extra force ) . + for the other limiting case @xmath133 @xmath134 + one should note that in the case of a heavy body with @xmath135 there exists a region @xmath136 such that @xmath137 . for this region one should carry out the calculations described in item  1 ( the case of a light body ) . but even for mercury ( if we suppose @xmath135 ) @xmath138 , and the constant extra acceleration appears to be @xmath139 which does not contradict the existing experimental restriction on a possible extra constant acceleration of the planet @xcite ( which should be much smaller than that of the pioneers 10 , 11 spacecraft ) .",
    "it is easy to check that for the other planets of the solar system @xmath140 also does not exceed the experimentally allowed limits @xcite .",
    "if one takes @xmath141 this region is absent and thus @xmath142 .",
    "of course , our density profiles for the planets are an idealization , but more realistic profiles should lead to the values of @xmath140 which lie somewhere between the limiting values obtained above .",
    "the same is valid for the values of the effective brans - dicke parameter @xmath124 .    the physical difference between the two cases can be easily explained . in the first case",
    "vectors @xmath143 are directed approximately parallel to the vector @xmath57 at any point of the second body , whereas in the second case these vectors are approximately parallel to the radius - vectors @xmath144 , which leads to the result discussed above .",
    "thus we have shown that in principle it is possible to construct a covariant theory which `` distinguishes '' light and heavy test bodies with respect to an external gravitational field of a source .",
    "we would also like to note that the value of the parameter @xmath72 which is necessary to reproduce the anomalous acceleration of the pioneer spacecraft was chosen to be @xmath145 .",
    "this value is quite close to the vacuum energy density @xmath146 , responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe . in this connection",
    "it is very interesting to examine possible cosmological manifestations of the model described by action ( [ act - bd ] ) .",
    "this issue calls for a more detailed and thorough investigation .",
    "of course we can not argue that the pioneer anomaly is indeed caused by the existence of such a dbi scalar field .",
    "moreover , recently it was shown that a part of the anomalous acceleration can be explained by the thermal recoil force effect @xcite .",
