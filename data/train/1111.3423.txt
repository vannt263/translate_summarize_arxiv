    "increasing amount of cosmological observations have provided convincing evidences that our universe is undergoing a late time acceleration .",
    "the observations of type ia supernova ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and the hubble data based on differential ages of the galaxies ( ohd ) @xcite definitely reveal the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "then how to explain the acceleration of the universe ?",
    "the simplest explanation is the cosmological constant ( cc ) which is raised by einstein in general relativity .",
    "the cosmological constant could fit the observations very well .",
    "however , it suffers from two fundamental problems : the fine tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "the fine tuning problem is the following .",
    "the cosmological constant is also the vacuum energy in quantum field theory .",
    "then the estimated value of the vacuum energy @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the planck density ) is greater than the observed value @xmath3 by @xmath4 orders of magnitude .",
    "the coincidence problem is the following .",
    "the densities of the dark energy and matter evolve differently as the universe expands .",
    "but they are comparable in the present - day universe .",
    "it is a great coincidence if there are no any internal connections between them .",
    "therefore , a lot of dynamical dark energy models have been explored .",
    "they are mainly classified into several types : scalar field theories , modified gravity theories , phenomenological models , and fluid dark energy models .",
    "the first type includes quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , quintom @xcite .",
    "the second type includes @xmath5 theory @xcite , dgp theory @xcite and so on .",
    "the third type includes holographic dark energy @xcite , the agegraphic dark energy @xcite and so on .",
    "last but not the least , there are fluid dark energy models mainly cover the chaplygin gas @xcite and the van der waals gas @xcite .",
    "kamenshchik _ et al .",
    "_ studied the standard chaplygin gas @xcite with the equation of state @xmath6 ( a is a positive constant ) .",
    "the standard chaplygin gas could behave as a pressureless dust at early times and as a cosmological constant at late times in the evolution of the universe .",
    "but it has difficulty in explaining the cmb anisotropic observations .",
    "the situation could be alleviated in the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite which has the equation of state @xmath7 with @xmath8 severely constrained , @xmath9 . in general , benaoum studied a new equation of state @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive constants ) .",
    "it could interpolate between standard fluids at high energy densities and chaplygin gas fluids at low energy densities @xcite . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of van der waals fluid as both the dark matter and dark energy , and ref .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the universe filled with a mixture of van der waals fluid and dark energy .",
    "the lattice fluid dark energy ( lfde ) investigated in this paper falls into this last type .",
    "the equation of state for lattice fluid is derived by sanchez and lacombe @xcite .",
    "one find that the lattice fluid model could perfectly describe the thermodynamic properties of a wide variety of fluids . on the other hand ,",
    "the four laws of black hole mechanics , which are analogous to those of thermodynamics , were originally derived from the classical einstein equation @xcite . until the discovery of the quantum hawking radiation @xcite , one recognize that the analogy is in fact an identity .",
    "so the nature of space , time and matter is closely related to the thermodynamics . by turning the logic around , we started from the thermoplastics in order to seek for the candidate of dark energy .",
    "we find that the lattice fluid could behave as a fluid with negative pressure which is exactly the property of dark energy .",
    "therefore we constrain the lfde from the observations of sne ia , bao and ohd .",
    "the paper is organized into four sections . in section",
    "ii , we derive the equation for the cosmic evolution of lfde in the background of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . in section iii , using the observational data of sne ia , bao and ohd , we seek for the best fit value of the parameter in the model . in section iv",
    ", we present the main results : the best fit value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 , the evolution of deceleration parameter @xmath14 , the statefinder parameters @xmath15 with the redshift @xmath16 .",
    "section v gives the conclusion and discussion .",
    "we shall use the units in which the speed of light @xmath17 is set to unity .",
    "the equation of state for lfde can be written as @xcite @xmath18\\ ; , \\label{eq : eos}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath21 is the present - day cosmic energy density defined by @xmath22 with @xmath23 the present - day hubble parameter .",
    "now we study the evolution of the universe filled with matter ( includes baryon matter and dark matter ) and lfde .",
    "the metric of frw universe is given by : @xmath24\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the scale factor and @xmath26 describe the topology of the universe which correspond to closed , flat and open universe , respectively .",
    "the scale factor evolves according to the friedmann equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total energy density of the universe .",
    "observations reveal that the universe is highly flat in space .",
    "so we put @xmath29 in the following .",
    "for the matter - plus - dark energy dominated universe , we can safely neglect the contribution of relativistic matter .",
    "then the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy density of matter and @xmath32 is the energy density of matter in the present - day universe .    in order to obtain @xmath19 , we substitute the equation of state for lfde eq .",
    "( [ eq : eos ] ) into the energy conservation equation : @xmath33    keeping in mind the relation @xmath34 and defining @xmath35 , we obtain the energy conservation equation as follows @xmath36\\right\\}=0\\;. \\label{eq : energycon2}\\ ] ]    this ordinary differential equation could not be solved analytically .",
    "so we are going to study the numerical solution by using the observational data from supernovae ia , baryonic acoustic oscillations and the observational hubble data .",
    "supernovae ia are generally believed to have homogeneous intrinsic luminosity of peak magnitude .",
    "so supernovae ia are usually known as standard candles which could be used to measure the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the analysis of their distance modulus versus redshift could provide direct evidence for the acceleration of the universe and the analysis also put a constraint on dark energy models .",
    "therefore , with the observation of sne ia data , we could obtain the best fit value of the parameter in our model . in order to constrain the equation of state for the lfde",

    "the observational distance modulus is give by @xmath50 where @xmath8 and @xmath51 are dimensionless parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath17 are shape parameter and color parameter derived from the fitting to light curves , respectively .",

    "@xmath55 also includes the contribution of peculiar velocity , @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the intrinsic dispersion of sne absolute magnitudes .",
    "the baryonic acoustic oscillations signatures in the large - scale clustering of galaxies could act as additional tests for cosmology , because the acoustic oscillations in the relativistic plasma of the early universe could be imprinted onto the late - time power spectrum of the non - relativistic matter @xcite .",

    "@xcite studied the spectroscopic sample of @xmath61 luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "they found that the combination @xmath62 has no dependence on the hubble constant @xmath23 because @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 . and the combination is well constrained by their data .",

    "given the measurement of the age difference of two passively - evolving galaxies formed nearly at the same time , @xmath70 t , and the small redshift interval @xmath70z by which they are separated , the ratio @xmath71 could be calculated .",
