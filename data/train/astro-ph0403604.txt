    "the depth of the solar convective zone has been measured by helioseismological techniques to high accuracy . in the most comprehensive study to date ,",
    "basu & antia ( 1997 ) have investigated the influence of observational and theoretical systematic uncertainties as well as measurement errors .",
    "basu and antia concluded that the base of the solar convective zone currently lies at a depth of @xmath7 the result of basu and antia is consistent with the earlier measurements of kosovichev & fedorova ( 1991 ) , who obtained @xmath8 , and christensen - dalsgaard , gough , & thompson ( 1991 ) , who also obtained @xmath9 , as well as with the determination of guzik & cox ( 1993 ) , who found @xmath10 .",
    "basu ( 1998 ) also studied the effect of the assumed value of the solar radius on the inferred depth of the convective zone and found @xmath11 .",
    "the analyses in these different studies span a wide range of reference solar models and analysis techniques .    on the basis of the analyses cited above",
    ", the measurement of the depth of the solar convective zone appears robust and precise .",
    "recently , new precision measurements have been made of the c , n , o , ne , and ar abundances on the surface of the sun ( allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2001 ; allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2002 ; asplund et al .",
    "2004 ; asplund et al .",
    "2000 ; asplund 2000 ) .",
    "these new abundance determinations use three - dimensional rather than one - dimensional atmospheric models , include hydrodynamical effects , and pay particular attention to uncertainties in atomic data and the observational spectra .",
    "the new abundance estimates , together with the previous best - estimates for other solar surface abundances  ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , imply @xmath12 , much less than the previous value of @xmath13 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) .    for a solar model with the recently - determined heavy element to hydrogen ratio , the calculated depth of the convective zone is  ( bahcall & pinsonneault 2004 ) @xmath14 which is very different from the measured depth of the cz ( see equation  [ [ eq : rczmeasured ] ] ) . on the other hand , basu and antia ( 2004 )   have shown that the helioseismological determination of @xmath15 , equation [ eq : rczmeasured ] , is not affected if one assumes the correctness of the lower heavy element abundances ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "something is wrong .",
    "we have a new solar problem : `` the convective zone ( cz ) problem . ''",
    "the radiative opacity is a key ingredient in calculating the depth of the convective zone .",
    "moreover , about 95% of the total radiative opacity near the base of the convective zone involves bound electrons , either bound - free or bound - bound opacity ( iglesias 2004 ) .",
    "thus opacity calculations in this region involve details of the ionization balance and other delicate atomic physics properties .    in this paper , we focus on determining the accuracy with which the opacity near the base of the convective zone must be known in order to calculate precisely the depth of the cz with a stellar evolution code .",
    "we also evaluate the accuracy with which the opacity near the base of the cz can be interpolated from opal tables . for a related comparison of the los alamos ledcop opacities and the opal opacities , see neuforge - verheecke et al .",
    "( 2001 )  . for comprehensive discussions of stellar radiative opacities ,",
    "the reader is referred to the important reviews by rogers and iglesias ( 1998 ) and by seaton et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we investigate in a paper in preparation ( bahcall , basu , pinsonneault , and serenelli 2004 )   the helioseismological implications of the changes in opacity that are discussed in the present paper .",
    "the viability of any proposed change in the opacity discussed in the present paper must be tested by comparing a solar model that is evolved with the changed opacity with a complete set of precise helioseismological data .",
    "there is no compelling reason to believe that the illustrative change in opacity considered here , which is highly peaked in radius , will be either reproduced exactly by new opacity calculations or will be precisely consistent with helioseismological constraints . in the future , once new opacity calculations are available that satisfy the requirements described in this paper , it will be possible to test simultaneously the new opacities , the solar model evolution , and the helioseismological implications .",
    "we derive in   [",
    "sec : dependence ] the dependence , @xmath16 , of the calculated depth of the solar convective zone upon the assumed radiative opacity .",
    "we apply this result to determine the accuracy with which the opacity must be known in order to calculate the depth of the cz to the accuracy with which it is measured helioseismologically .",
    "we also determine the change in the standard opal opacity that is required in order to reconcile the helioseismological measurement with the recent determinations of heavy element abundances .",
    "we evaluate in   [ sec : composition ] the dependence of the radiative opacity near the base of the convective zone upon the stellar composition .",
    "we find that the opacity depends sensitively upon the assumed heavy element abundance .",
    "we compare in ",
    "[ sec : comparison ] the opacities obtained from two different interpolation schemes that are both applied to the same published opal opacity tables . throughout this paper , we adopt the opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1991a , b ; rogers & iglesias 1992 ; iglesias & rogers 1996 ) as standard , when supplemented at low temperatures by values from alexander & fergusson ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use simulated opacity tables in   [ sec : shifted ] to estimate the likely uncertainties that result from interpolations within the existing opal opacity tables and to determine the grid sizes to obtain small interpolation errors . for completeness and for contrast , we use four different equations of state to show in appendix  a that uncertainties due to the choice of eos are not important , at the present level of accuracy , for the calculation of the depth of the solar convective zone . we also demonstrate in appendix  b that uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates affect the depth of the solar convective zone only at the level of 0.1% . in appendix  c",
    ", we verify that the conversion of carbon and oxygen in cno burning , which can not be accurately modeled with existing opacity codes , causes a 0.1% uncertainty in the calculated depth of the convective zone .",
    "basu and antia ( 2004 ) ( see also asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) have shown that errors in the calculation of the diffusion coefficients are unlikely to be the correct explanation of the discrepancy between measured and calculated depth of the solar convective zone .",
    "other solar model ingredients , including the element diffusion coefficients , can affect the calculated depth of the convective zone .",
    "a complete investigation of all the possible effects on the convective zone is beyond the scope of the present paper and would distract the reader from our main concern , the effect of the radiative opacity .",
    "moreover , we believe that the radiative opacity and the heavy element abundance provide the single largest contributions to the error budget for the calculation of the solar convective zone .",
    "the effect of the heavy element abundance on the calculated depth of the convective zone has been evaluated in bahcall and pinsonneault ( 2004 ) .",
    "we summarize and discuss our main results .",
    "in this section , we determine the dependence of the calculated depth of the solar convective zone upon the value of the radiative opacity in the vicinity of the base of the convective zone . using this dependence ,",
    "we then answer two questions .",
    "first , how accurately must the radiative opacity be known in order to calculate the depth of the convective zone to the accuracy with which the depth is measured by helioseismology ?",
    "second , how large must the error in the radiative opacity at the base of the solar convective zone be in order to explain the difference between the measured value of @xmath15 and the value of @xmath15 that is calculated in a solar model that is constructed using the recently determined heavy element abundances ( @xmath12 ) ?",
    "we follow the approach introduced by bahcall , bahcall , & ulrich ( 1969 ) in which we change the standard ( opal ) opacity in the vicinity of the cz by a small functional amount that depends upon an adjustable parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we calculate a series of solar models for different values of @xmath17 , which permits us to evaluate the logarithmic derivative of @xmath15 with respect to the opacity near the base of the cz .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the solar models used in our studies .",
    "the solar age adopted in this article is @xmath18 yr . at this age ,",
    "the solar models are required to have the present values for the solar luminosity ( l@xmath19 ) , the solar radius ( r@xmath19 ) , and the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen by mass(@xmath20 ) .",
    "we adopt the values l@xmath21 ergs@xmath22 , @xmath23 cm , and @xmath24 respectively ( see bahcall , pinsonneault , & basu 2001 ) .",
    "the models are calculated using the opal equation of state ( hereafter opal 1996 ; rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) unless stated otherwise , and the opal opacities ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates are those used in bahcall et al .",
    "element diffusion is incorporated for helium and metals ( thoul , bahcall , & loeb 1994 ) .",
    "we use the mixing length theory for convection and the schwarzschild criterion to determine the location of the convective boundaries .    [ !",
    "t ]    .2 in    .the adopted compositions used for the computation of solar models bp04 + and bp04 ( and variations thereupon ) .",
    "the relative abundances given in the table denote log  @xmath25 in the usual scale in which log @xmath26= 12 .",
    "we use meteoritic abundances when available . in the past ,",
    "when conflicts between meteoritic and atmospheric abundances have existed , the meteoritic determinations have often turned out to be more correct . [",
    "tab : composition ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for completeness , we record here the small effect that the rates of nuclear reactions have on the calculated depth of the solar convective zone . in table  1 of bahcall and pinsonneault ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the neutrino fluxes are listed for two models , bp00 and new nuclear , that differ only in the adopted nuclear reactions .",
    "the new nuclear model was computed using the best - estimate nuclear rates as of the end of 2003 , while the model bp00 was computed using the best rates available in 2000 .",
    "the computed depths for the convective zone are @xmath27 ( for bp00 ) and @xmath28 ( for new nuclear ) .",
    "thus , the current uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates affect the calculated depth of the solar convective zone at the level of @xmath29% .",
    "during the course of cno burning , nearly all of @xmath30c and a fraction of @xmath31o are converted to @xmath32n ( for the earliest discussion of this process , see section  ii.c.2 of bahcall and ulrich 1988 and also section  iii.a of bahcall and pinsonneault 1992 ) .",
    "this process increases slightly ( decreases slightly ) the heavy element ( hydrogen ) mass fraction since , for example , two protons are added to @xmath30c to make @xmath32n .",
    "unfortunately , the enhancement of @xmath32n at the expenses of hydrogen can not be exactly taken into account with the existing opal opacity tables .",
    "the existing tables do not allow the selective enhancement of nitrogen .",
    "we have therefore evolved two different solar models with two different treatments of the @xmath32n enhancement . in the first model ,",
    "the enhancement is taken into account and absorbed into the total heavy element abundance , z. this treatment correctly accounts for the increase in z and the decrease of x when calculating the opacities but , incorrectly , spreads the increased heavy element abundance among all of the metals according to their initial relative abundances .",
    "thus , the solar interior opacity is slightly overestimated . in the second model",
    ", we completely ignored the increase in z due to the conversion of carbon and oxygen into nitrogen when computing the opacities . in this case , the solar interior opacity is slightly underestimated .",
