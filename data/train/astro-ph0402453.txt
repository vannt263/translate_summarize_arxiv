    "in 1992 , it was demonstrated by boroson & green that the optical emission line properties in the region of the spectrum around h@xmath1 are strongly correlated with one another .",
    "a principal components analysis allowed the largest differences among optical emission line properties to be gathered together in a construct commonly known as `` eigenvector 1 '' .",
    "the strongest differences hinged on the strength of the and [ ] emission , and the width and asymmetry of h@xmath1 .",
    "this set of strong correlations is remarkable , as it involves correlations among the dynamics and gas properties between emission regions separated by vast distances .",
    "furthermore , the same set of correlations are observed in samples selected in many different ways .",
    "this pervasiveness leads us to believe that we are observing the manifestation of a primary physical parameter .",
    "a favored explanation is that it is the accretion rate relative to the black hole mass onto the active nucleus ( e.g. , boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; comastri et al .",
    "1998 ; leighly 1999ab ; mathur 2000 ; mineshige et al .",

    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are identified by their optical emission line properties .",
    "they typically have narrow permitted optical lines ( fwhm of h@xmath2 ) , weak forbidden lines ( [ ] /h@xmath3 ; this distinguishes them from seyfert 2 galaxies ) , and frequently they show strong emission ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "these are the same properties that define the boroson & green ( 1992 ) eigenvector 1 , and indeed , nls1s fall at one end of eigenvector 1 .",
    "thus , the study of nls1s offers an attractive research opportunity : if we can understand the origin of the emission - line properties of nls1s , then we may be in a position to understand agn emission in general .",
    "furthermore , because as least some of the lines in nls1s are narrow , identification of the frequently strongly - blended lines is less ambiguous than it is in broad - line objects .",
    "nls1 research dramatically increased after the publication of a seminal paper in 1996 by boller , brandt & fink describing their discovery that nls1s have systematically steeper _ rosat _ spectra than agn with broad optical lines .",
    "subsequently it was shown from _ asca _",
    "observations that the hard x - ray spectrum is also steeper ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ; leighly 1999b ) , and that the x - ray emission shows higher fractional amplitude of variability ( leighly 1999a ) .",
    "these results were generally interpreted as evidence that the black hole is systematically smaller in nls1s , implying a higher accretion rate relative to the eddington value compared with seyfert 1 galaxies with broad optical lines .",
    "once the high accretion rate paradigm was established , it could be used to understand why nls1s have narrow optical lines .",
    "boller , brandt , & fink ( 1996 ) mention that if the black hole mass in nls1s is smaller , and the emission lines are produced at the same radius as in broad - line objects ( due to the same radiating flux ) the dynamical velocities will be smaller , and narrower lines will be produced .",
    "this theme was expanded upon by wandel & boller ( 1998 ) , who consider the fact that the steeper soft x - ray spectrum of nls1s , when extrapolated into the uv , implies a larger ionizing flux relative to their luminosity .",
    "this causes the emission region to be larger where the velocities are smaller .",
    "however , the optical emission lines are only one side of the coin ; uv emission lines , generally characterized by a higher degree of ionization , may also provide valuable information .",
    "this is because the optical and uv emission lines are generally not produced in the same gas .",
    "the best evidence for this comes from so - called reverberation mapping experiments ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) . also , the profiles of the emission lines suggest this as well , as the higher ionization lines are observed to be generally broader than the lower ionization lines ( e.g. , baldwin 1997 ) . therefore , we may learn more about nls1s by studying their uv emission lines .",
    "several groups have investigated the uv emission line properties of nls1s .",
    "the first paper investigating a sample of iue spectra from nls1s was published by rodrguez - pascual , mas - hesse & santos - lle ( 1997 ) .",
    "they reported that the strongest uv emission lines have broad wings , unlike the optical emission lines , and they speculate that the uv line - emitting gas may be optically thin in the continuum .",
    "kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) present a detailed study of _ iue _ and _ hst _ spectra from nls1s .",
    "they found that , compared with broad - line quasars , the equivalent widths of and are low .",
    "they found that , in the cases where the lines could be deblended ,",
    "the ] / ] ratio was high .",
    "in addition , the + ] feature near 1400   was found to be strong compared with , and the equivalent width was high .",
    "they also found that although the uv emission lines in nls1s are broader than the balmer lines , they still tend to be narrower than those lines in broad - line quasars .",
    "they then model many of the emission line ratios using a 1-zone _ cloudy _ model ( ferland 2001 ) .",
    "they infer that the line ratios imply that the ionization parameter is lower and the density is higher in nls1s than in broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we comment on their inferences in the companion paper to this one ( leighly 2004a ; hereafter referred to as paper ii ) .",
    "wills et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , studying the _ hst _ spectra from a small sample of pg quasars , found that eigenvector 1 is also associated with a high ] to ] ratio , stronger uv low - ionization lines , weaker , but stronger .",
    "they infer from these spectra that nls1s are typified by high densities , low ionization parameters , and nitrogen enhancement , perhaps from nuclear starbursts .",
    "all the work done so far on the uv spectra of nls1s has been generally confined to studies of the properties of the integrated lines , to a greater or lesser extent , depending on the analysis .",
    "specifically , the conditions of a single - zone blr are modelled or discussed more or less quantitatively , and evidence for a radially - extended blr is inferred when particular lines are found to not be consistent with the one - zone model ( e.g. , kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) infer that , since the observed is underpredicted by the one - zone model , it must be produced in a different region than the other uv emission lines ) . however , we know that generally the emission line profiles are not all the same , and higher ionization lines tend to have broader profiles .",
    "this implies that the gas properties are different among regions with larger or smaller line - of - sight velocities , and therefore a study of the average properties could be misleading .    in this paper , we present the observations and analysis of _ hst _ observations of two nls1s that have truly remarkable uv spectra . in section 2 , we introduce the targets , describe our observations and discuss the analysis of the emission lines . in section 3",
    ", we compare the results from these two nls1s with spectra from 14 nls1s drawn from the _ hst _ archive , and perform a correlation analysis and a principal components analysis on the results . in a companion paper ii , photoionization analysis , and a toy dynamical model are presented , and the results are discussed .",

    "the motivation for the _ hst _ observations was the discovery of a peculiar feature near 1 kev observed in the _ asca _ spectra ( leighly et al .",
    "this feature appeared to be an absorption edge , but the energy was clearly too high to be ascribed to highly - ionized oxygen , which is generally the most important source of x - ray opacity .",
    "leighly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) speculated that oxygen was indeed responsible for the feature , and , if so , the absorbing gas was outflowing at rather large velocities .",
    "this interpretation was strengthened by the similarity between luminous nls1s and low - ionization balqsos ( e.g. , boroson & meyers 1992 for i  zw  1 ) .",

    "the extended emission probably originates in a starburst in the host galaxy , and therefore provides a good estimate of the systemic redshift .",

    "1997 ) . however , as discussed in section  3 , they are somewhat different than the other narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars .",
    "the presence of strong low - ionization lines in our spectra is similar to that seen in several pg quasars ( wills et al .",
    "1999 ; see their figure 1 ) .",
    "the profound differences in the profiles of the high- and low - ionization lines are highlighted in fig .",
    "3 , which compares the profile of the prototypical high - ionization line with the profile of a low - ionization line , for our nls1s and for a composite quasar spectrum ( francis et al .",
    "it has been previously noted that high - ionization lines are frequently broader and strongly blueshifted compared with the low - ionization lines ( e.g. , tytler & fan 1992 ; marziani et al .",
    "the velocity offsets in described by marziani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) range from zero to @xmath15 ; the centroids of our profiles are offset by @xmath16 , as large as the largest values values found by marziani et al .",
    "these profiles are most simply explained if the high - ionization line - emitting gas is accelerated toward us in a wind , while the low - ionization line - emitting gas is located on the surface of the accretion disk , or in the low - velocity base of the wind .",
    "the wind may be accelerated by radiative - line driving from the strong uv continuum .",
    "this process is commonly inferred to be occurring in hot stars and cataclysmic variables , but it has also been applied to agn ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 ; murray & chiang 1998 ; proga , stone , & kallman 2000 ) , and we discuss this further in paper ii .",
    "the accretion disk is assumed optically thick , so that we do not see the receding wind on the other side .",
    "hence , the emission lines are predominantly blueshifted .",
    "collin - souffrin et al .",
    "( 1988 ) were the first to suggest a two - component broad - line region in which the high - ionization lines are produced in a wind , and the low - ionization lines are associated with the outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "the spectra presented here arguably provide the strongest support for this scenario to date .    because the high - ionization lines are nearly disjoint in velocity space compared with the low- and intermediate - ionization lines , we model them separately .",
    "we then use the results to constrain photoionization models for the conditions of the disk and wind separately in paper ii and other similar intermediate - ionization lines in our spectra appear to be produced in the disk . ] .",
    "such an undertaking is fraught with peril . in the emission - line profile , we observe only the velocity component parallel to our line of sight .",
    "especially problematic is the gas at zero velocity , as the emitting matter may have huge transverse velocity that we can not detect .",
    "however , such an approach is not without precedent : baldwin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) analyzed the spectra from a luminous quasar q0207@xmath0398 in this way .    to measure the line properties , we adopted a modified version of the procedure used by baldwin et al .",
    "we outline the procedure here , and describe the application to each region of the spectra below ; the results are given in fig .",
    "4 and table 2 .",
    "first , we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "3 suggests that , to zeroth order , the wind and disk lines are kinematically disjoint .",
    "we further assume , to begin with , that all high - ionization lines have the same velocity profile ; we comment on the validity of that assumption below .",
    "then , since is isolated compared with the other high - ionization lines , we use it to create a wind - profile template that is used to model the other high - ionization lines . the procedure used to develop the template is described in the next section .",
    "the intermediate- and low - ionization lines appear to be predominately symmetric about their rest wavelengths ; therefore , we model them using symmetric lorenzian or gaussian profiles",
    ". preliminary examination of spectra showed that we could not assume the same velocity width for all the intermediate- and low - ionization lines , as could be seen to be clearly significantly narrower than ] . therefore , in fitting the intermediate- and low - ionization lines , we allowed the width to remain an adjustable parameter so long as it could be constrained usefully in the fitting .",
    "generally , the widths could be usefully constrained unless the lines are very weak ( e.g. , section 2.3.7 ) , or unless the feature is comprised of several heavily - blended components , in which case we fixed the velocity width for particular individual lines to the values measured from other lines .",
    "the next sections explain the process that we used to model the spectra . throughout",
    ", we use a locally - defined continuum .",
    "this is necessary because the strong and multiplets that may form a pseudo - continuum that masks the real continuum .",
    "we note that placement of the continuum is a potentially significant source of uncertainty in the measurement of the emission - line flux .",
    "first , the continuum was locally identified around the emission line , then fit with a linear model and subtracted .",
    "next , we removed the portions of the profile contaminated by absorption lines originating in our galaxy ( blades et al .",
    "the galactic column is significant in the direction of our quasars , and there are a number of fairly strong lines apparent in the spectrum",
    ". careful examination of the profile reveals faint absorption lines that were detected by blades et al .",
    "but were not identified .",
    "the regions of the profile contaminated by absorption lines were removed and the profile was fitted with a high - order spline model .    the line is a doublet , but the final template should consist of the contribution of only one component . to derive the profile of one component , we used a procedure similar to that used by baldwin et al .",
    "we assumed that each of the two components contributed equally to the line ( that is , the line is optically thick ) .",
    "the approximate contribution of one component of the doublet was then obtained from the spline model by a sort of bootstrap method .",
    "the doublet components are separated by 45 wavelength bins .",
    "therefore , the 4 or 5 points at longer wavelength side of the spline model consists solely of the lower energy component , so these can be used to determine the amplitude of the 4 or 5 longest wavelength points of the template .",
    "points shortward of this consist of the sum of both lower - energy and the higher - energy components .",
    "at the next point , where @xmath17 , for example , the amplitude of the higher - energy component at @xmath18 is already known , because it must have the amplitude of the lower energy component at @xmath1912 .",
    "then , since the sum of the lower and higher - energy components at any point @xmath18 must equal the spline model at that point , the amplitude of lower - energy profile at point @xmath18 can be solved for .",
    "thus , the amplitudes of the remaining points could be determined iteratively .",
    "the emission lines , the contribution of each multiplet and the resulting profiles are shown in fig .",
    "interestingly , the shape of the template is slightly but distinguishably different between the two objects .",
    "the template developed using the profile , shown in fig .",
    "4 , was next fit to the ly@xmath7/ region in both spectra .",
    "a second - order polynomial was used to model the local continuum , which was then subtracted .",
    "the fitting was done by first transforming the template spectrum to the rest energy of the emission line in question and then adjusting the normalization until some part of the profile did not obviously exceed the height of the spectrum ; i.e. , if the model were subtracted from the data , no obvious negative residuals would be present .",
    "a narrow component of ly@xmath7 was also clearly visible .",
    "this is inferred to originate from the disk , and it is modelled as a gaussian .",
    "both components of the doublet were modeled and the flux ratio between the doublet components was again assumed to be 1 to 1 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "this procedure resulted in a good fit for iras  13224@xmath03809 .",
    "excess emission shortward of ly@xmath7 may come from * @xmath20 line , a line that has been identified in the spectrum of the prototype nls1 i  zw  1 ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ) . is strong elsewhere in the spectrum and may contribute near 1190 angstroms as well . note that the deficit near 1222   in the rest frame is caused by galactic absorption ( fig .  2 ) .    the fit results for 1h  0707@xmath0495 are less satisfactory",
    "excess emission is present both redward and blueward of the line .",
    "the blueward emission could also be present in iras  13224@xmath03809 but it may be hidden by the galactic absorption line near 1222  .",
    "this excess emission could be an indication that our assumption that all of the resonance lines have the same profile is to some degree incorrect ; however , we can not clearly see the blue side of that line because it is blended with the broad ly@xmath7 line , so we can not clearly evaluate whether this assumption is good or not .",
    "we plan to address this question in a future paper involving the line observed in the _ fuse _ spectrum of 1h  0707@xmath0495 .    in both cases ,",
    "since the wind profile fits well , we conclude there is no disk contribution to this line .",
    "both a disk and a wind component are necessary , on the other hand , to model ly@xmath7 .",
    "the feature near 1400  is clearly broad and asymmetric and at least part of it must be emitted in the wind .",
    "this is a complicated feature in agn in general , because it may be comprised of emission from both ] and .",
    "is usually a lower - ionization line than the other lines produced in the wind .",
    "the disk contributes low - ionization lines ( e.g. , , as in fig .",
    "3 ) ; therefore it is possible that there is a contribution from from the disk in the 1400  feature . to try to account for this possibility in a general way ,",
    "our model for this region consists of components of wind emission from each of and ] that are modelled using the template developed from as discussed in section 2.3.1 .",
    "we also include components of disk emission from each of and ] that are modelled as gaussians , as discussed above .",
    "there are thus 4 components in the model .",
    "we assumed that the emission ratios of the two components of the doublet have equal flux ( optically thick ) .",
    "for ] we assumed optically thin ratios .",
    "these depend partially on density and were found to be 0.011:0.225:0.458:0.082:0.225 for the @xmath211397.2 , @xmath211399.8 , @xmath211401.2 , @xmath211404.8 & @xmath211407.4 emission lines respectively ( flower & nussbaumer ( 1975 ) and nussbaumer & storey ( 1982 ) assuming a density of @xmath22 .",
    "we first determined the upper limits of the four components listed above by overlaying each one on the line profile separately and adjusting the amplitude until some part of the component was as large as the line ; i.e. , no large negative fit residuals were permitted .",
    "those upper limits are listed in table 2 .",
    "next , we investigated whether or not the entire feature could have been emitted in the wind ; that is , is the disk component necessary ?",
    "we overlayed the sum of the ] and wind components on the profile , adjusting the amplitudes as described above .",
    "while the shortest wavelength , blueshifted part of the feature could be modeled by the sum of the wind components from ] and , the longest wavelength part , near the rest energies of ] and , could not .",
    "we inferred that the excess emission near the rest energies of these features is emission from the disk . to model the disk component",
    ", emission line blends for and ] were constructed using gaussians , assuming again that is optically thick and ] is optically thin , as above .",
    "the widths of these gaussians could not be independently determined in the fit , so we assumed a fwhm of 7 angstroms , corresponding to @xmath23 .",
    "this is close to the value found for the 1900  lines ( section 2.3.4 ) .",
    "the 1400  feature is very complicated .",
    "we show a model in fig.4 that appears to fit the profile , and the parameters for this model are listed in the table 2 ; however , we do not claim that this model is unique .",
    "all we can really conclude is that emission from both the disk and the wind is necessary to explain the profile ; the wind portion is needed to explain the shorter wavelength , blueshifted part , and the disk portion is needed to explain the rest - wavelength part .",

    "a possible candidate could be ] @xmath24 1416.93 , 1423.86 ( harper et al.1999 ) .      in the wavelength range between 1800 and 2000 ",

    "these lines appear to be narrow , symmetric , strongly peaked , and centered at the emission line wavelength .",
    "thus , we infer they are from the disk and that no measurable wind component is present in the 1900 feature .",
    "we use the spectral fitting package _ liner _",
    "( pogge & owen 1993 ) to model the lines .",
    "we first attempt to model the emission lines as gaussians ; however , they are too strongly peaked for this to provide a good fit",
    ". therefore , we use lorenzian profiles and obtain a better fit , although we note that lorenzian profiles may overestimate the line flux due to the large contributions in the wings that are difficult to distinguish from the continuum .",
    "however , there remains excess emission around 1925   that most probably originates in the 34 multiplet .",
    "this multiplet consist of three lines at 1895.46 , 1914.06 , and 1926.30   ( e.g. , graham , clowes & campusano 1996 ) .",
    "we include these three emission lines in the model , assuming that their fluxes are equal ( e.g. , hartig & baldwin 1986 ; see also section 3 ) . in the final model ,",
    "we hold the emission line wavelength fixed at the rest wavelength , the width of ] , ] and are constrained to be equal , and the widths of the 34 multiplet components are constrained to be equal .",
    "the spectrum from 1h  0707@xmath0495 appears to be more difficult to model well .",
    "there seems to be more present in the spectrum of this object .",
    "a completely satisfactory fit could not be obtained .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    this line was very difficult to identify and measure .",
    "following the example of i  zw  1 , and the other high ionization lines , we expected it to be strongly blueshifted and broad ; i.e. , from the wind .",
    "indeed , we see no evidence for a narrow emission line at 1640  .",
    "we defined a local continuum from apparently line - free region , and measured the line using the wind template developed from the profile , as was done above .",
    "this measurement is not very satisfactory as there are other emission features of the same amplitude , probably originating in , near the feature that we identify as .",

    "1991 ) ; the radio - quiet composite from _ hst _ spectra ( zheng et al .",
    "1997 ) ; a composite spectrum from the first bright quasar survey ( brotherton et al .",
    "2001 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the equivalent widths of the prominent features in our spectra are the same or smaller than the equivalent widths in the composites , except for , which has larger equivalent widths in our spectra .",
    "zheng et al .",
    "attempt to deconvolve from ly@xmath7 ; in that case , ly@xmath7 in our spectra are about one third , and are nearly double the equivalent width of that in the zheng composite .",
    "the whole 1400 feature and 1900 feature have about the same equivalent width as the composite .",
    "zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) attempt a deconvolution of the 1900 feature ; our spectra have the same equivalent widths , larger by a factor of two ] equivalent widths , and much smaller ( by a factor of 3 ) ] equivalent widths than the zheng composite .",
    "the largest differences are in and , which have much smaller ( one fifth to one half ) the equivalent width of the composite spectra .",
    "these comparisons underline the fact that the uv emission lines , excepting , are relatively weak in nls1s .",
    "the uv and optical properties of iras 13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 , including their luminosity , their emission line profiles , and their equivalent widths and ratios , are almost identical .",
    "how do their properties compare with those of other nls1s ? this is an important question for two reasons .",
    "first , their x - ray properties , while again virtually identical to one another , are markedly different from those of other nls1s . in a study of the x - ray properties of nls1s using",
    "_ asca _ data , leighly ( 1999b ) found that there is a correlation between the prominence or strength of the soft excess and the amplitude of the variability , with iras  13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 displaying among the strongest soft excesses and highest - amplitude variability in the sample .",
    "also , these objects are two of the three that possess an unusual spectral feature near 1  kev that has been interpreted as highly blueshifted absorption feature ( leighly et al .  1997 ) or as strong fe - l absorption ( nicastro , fiore & matt 1999 ) .",
    "we would like to know if the differences between iras 13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 and other nls1s that are found in the x - ray band are also seen in the uv band .",
    "the second reason we are motivated to compare these two objects with other nls1s involves our interpretation of our analysis of the uv spectra that is discussed in detail in paper ii .    to address these questions",
    ", we retrieved the spectra from a heterogeneous group of 14 nls1s from the _ hst _ archive , and analyzed them .",
    "analysis of properties of nls1 uv spectra has been previously presented by several groups . however , reanalysis is necessary because we wish to investigate both the emission line profiles and their equivalent widths and ratios .",
    "the most detailed investigation to date was presented by kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "our analysis differs from theirs in that they confined their analysis to the emission - line fluxes and ratios , while we are interested also in the emission - line profiles , in particular that of , as well .",
    "a comparison of the blueshift of with the width of h@xmath1 has been published by marziani et al .",
    "however , they do not consider the fluxes and ratios of other important lines in the spectrum .",
    "the following objects , listed in order of right ascension , were investigated : mrk  335 , wpvs  007 , i  zw  1 , ton  s180 , rx  j0134.2@xmath04258 , pg  1001@xmath29054 , re  1034@xmath2939 , pg  1115@xmath29407 , pg  1211@xmath29143 , pg  1404@xmath29226 , pg  1402@xmath29261 , mrk  478 , mrk  493 , and ark  564 .",
    "these objects represent a range of redshifts from 0.024 to 0.235 , and span two orders of magnitude in monochromatic luminosity at 2500 ; the luminosities of iras  13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 are in the middle of the sample .",
    "almost all of these spectra were obtained using the fos detector and therefore we reprocessed all of them , using the post operational archives ( poa ) calibration when appropriate .",
    "ton  s180 was observed with the stis detector , and we retrieved those data from the archive using `` on - the - fly '' reprocessing .",
    "we checked the wavelength calibration of each spectrum using the galactic absorption lines .",
    "the spectra were then shifted up to @xmath30 as necessary .",
    "our first estimate of the redshift was obtained from the spectra directly , by fitting the lines .",
    "we assume that lines are centered at the systemic redshift .",
    "this is justified by the similarity between and h@xmath1 emission in agns ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ) , and the fact that all of these objects have narrow h@xmath1 and .",
    "these redshifts were in good agreement with those listed in ned .",
    "the spectra were then shifted into the rest frame .",
    "the galactic e(b - v ) was obtained from ned , and the spectra were corrected using the ccm reddening law ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "we used a procedure similar to that employed for iras  13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 as described in section 3.1 to investigate the profile of the line .",
    "we first identified and subtracted the local continuum , and excluded portions of the profile modified by galactic absorption lines .",
    "we require a smoothed profile to study the shape of the line .",
    "we used two different methods depending on the signal - to - noise ratio to obtain the smoothed profile .",
    "when the signal - to - noise ratio was relatively high , we fit the continuum - subtracted spectrum in the region of the emission line with a spline function as described in section 2.3.1 .",
    "when the signal to noise is lower , the multinode spline could not be constrained , so instead we fit the profile with several gaussians or lorenzians , and used the model as our smoothed profile . in a few objects ( ark 564 , wpvs 007 , pg 1404 + 226 ) , the line profiles were altered by the presence of strong associated absorption lines .",
    "for these objects , the line profiles were reconstructed using multiple - component fits , but there is no doubt that the result is uncertain , especially with regard to the equivalent widths .",
    "therefore , these objects are denoted by a different symbol in plots that include information .",
    "a broad absorption line is observed in pg 1001 + 054 ( brandt , laor & wills 2000 ) .",
    "however , this broad absorption line appears to be sufficiently detached that it does not alter the line profile .",
    "we then measured a number of properties from the resulting profile , including the flux and equivalent width .",
    "we investigated several possible ways to parameterize the shape and offset of the line .",
    "we considered using the velocity offset ( e.g. , marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) ; however , this does not take into account the fact that the lines are very asymmetric .",
    "we looked into using the moments of the line profile ( mean , variance , skew and kurtosis ) .",
    "we also investigated using the fraction of the line blueward of the rest wavelength ( here taken to be 1549.5  , the average of the doublet wavelengths ) .",
    "we found that the mean wavelength is strongly correlated with the fraction of the emission blueward of 1549.5  , and finally opted to use the latter as the parameter representing the asymmetry and blueshift of the line .",
    "we also obtained the kurtosis as a measurement of the peakiness of the line : a line with positive kurtosis is pointy , and a line with negative kurtosis has a flattened profile .",
    "other high ionization lines were measured .",
    "we obtained a rough estimate of the flux and equivalent width of by modeling it with several gaussians or lorenzians . in some objects ,",
    "the lines were narrow enough that could be cleanly separated from ly@xmath7 , and the principal uncertainty in the measurements of the flux and equivalent width is the placement of the continuum .",
    "in other objects , overlapped ly@xmath7 ; we estimate the uncertainty in the flux and equivalent width may be as high as 40% for these objects .",
    "as discussed in section 2.3.3 , the ] and lines near 1400  were quite difficult to separate in iras  13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 .",
    "thus , for these other objects , we measure the flux and equivalent width of the whole 1400 feature by simply integrating over it after defining a local continuum . was also measured . in some objects ,",
    "this line was blended with ] @xmath31 ; in these cases , we used a model consisting of several gaussians to isolate the contribution of .",
    "in several objects , a significant source of uncertainty was determination of the continuum when the relatively weak line was blueshifted and broad .",
    "finally , we computed ratios of the fluxes of the high - ionization lines with that of .",
    "the feature near 1900 is comprised primarily of the intermediate ionization lines , ] , ] , and uv34 .",
    "this was modeled in a way similar to that described in section 2.3.4 . as discussed in vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the uv34 multiplet ( 1894.8 , 1914.1 , 1926.3 ; @xmath32 ) contributes significant uncertainty to line measurements in this region .",
    "however , in all of the objects that we looked at , the intermediate ionization lines appeared to be narrow , symmetric , and centered at their rest wavelengths .",
    "we therefore assumed that all of the lines in the 1900 feature have the same width , and assumed that they are centered at their rest wavelength .",
    "the presence of uv34 generally could be ascertained by the presence of the 1926 line , which was discernible from the wings of ] lines in these narrow - line objects .",
    "the gf values obtained from the atomic line list indicate that in the optically - thin case , the line ratios 1926:1914:1895 should be 1:1.4:1.8 .",
    "however , radiative transfer is likely to be important for these lines . in some cases ,",
    "the spectra were fit well assuming that the three lines have equal intensity , as would be appropriate if the gas is very optically thick .",
    "however , in several objects ( e.g. , ark 564 ; fig .",
    "15 ) , the 1914 component was much stronger than the other two ; this enhancement was discussed previously by vestergaard & wilkes ( 2000 ) for i  zw  1 , although these authors do not give an explanation for it .",
    "it turns out that the upper - level energy for this transition is @xmath33 , corresponding to 1214.6 , which is just 1.1 from ly@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the 1914 component of the uv34 feature is plausibly selectively excited by ly@xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , this seems to be almost the only line emitted under broad - line region conditions that can be excited from the ground state by ly@xmath7 ; many more lines , including @xmath34 for example , may be pumped by ly@xmath1 , and may be pumped by ly@xmath7 from low - lying metastable levels ( e.g. , sigut & pradhan 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , we also fit with a model in which the 1895 and 1926  components are constrained to have equal intensities , and the 1914  intensity is left free . in this case , the 1914  component ranges from 1.8 to typically 3 times the strength of the other two .",
    "the fluxes of , ] , and ] lines , and the velocity width of ] were measured , and the ratios of and ] to ] were formed .",
    "the 1900 feature is complex ; thus , there is significant uncertainty in the relative intensities of the ] and ] lines ; was separated sufficiently from the the other two that uncertainty in this line was dominated by the continuum placement .",
    "we obtained the equivalent widths and velocity widths of the line after subtracting the uv as described in section 2.3.6 .",
    "a by - product of the subtraction procedure is a measure of the slope of the continuum @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , in the uv between about 2200 and 3050 ( see moore & leighly , in prep .  for details ) .",
    "we also measured the monochromatic luminosity at restframe 2500 and 1400 .",
    "finally , we used generally nonsimultaneous x - ray data to estimate @xmath37 , the point - to - point power - law energy index between 2500 and 2  kev in the rest frame .",
    "if available , _ asca _ data were used because flux at 2  kev could be estimated better than from _ rosat _",
    "data in which 2  kev falls at the end of the bandpass . uncertainties in intrinsic @xmath37 originate in the lack of simultaneity of the observations , and reddening or absorption arising in the host galaxy or agn .",
    "we performed a correlation analysis of the parameters discussed above , using the spearman rank correlation coefficient . in a few cases",
    ", parameters could not be measured : an example is rx  j0134.2@xmath04258 , in which no ] , ] and were detected .",
    "we also do not use the velocity width of ] for 1h  0707@xmath0495 because it was much larger than the widths of other similar lines in that object ( see section 2.3.4 ) .",
    "since we are only missing one object ( three in one case ) among 16 , we do not use a survival analysis .",
    "the probabilities of accidental correlation are given in the correlation matrix in table 3 .",
    "we performed a principle components analysis using the correlation matrix .",
    "although the number of objects and parameters is small , we obtain a fairly significant clustering of correlations .",
    "the first three eigenvectors are given in table 4 ; they represent 78% of the variance in the sample .",
    "we caution that our sample is small , so these eigenvectors may not survive if faced with a larger sample .",
    "nevertheless , they provide a convenient organizational framework in which to discuss the correlations .",
    "eigenvector 1 is aligned along the mutually strong correlations between equivalent width and profile shape . a number of other parameters are strongly correlated or anticorrelated with the asymmetry of the line .",
    "these include the high - ionization properties of the equivalent width of and the / ratio , the intermediate - ionization line properties of the / ] ratio and the ] / ] ratio , and the continuum property @xmath37 . a number of these are shown in fig .  7 .",
    "another interesting correlation is the one between the / ratio and the / ratio ; we defer that discussion until section 3.1.3 .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is strongly anticorrelated with the equivalent width ; that is , the strongly blueshifted lines have the lowest equivalent width .",
    "this was previously reported in leighly 2001 for this sample , and has since then been recovered from the sdss quasars ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) , and a similar correlation was previously noted by wills et al .",
    "the kurtosis is strongly anticorrelated with the asymmetry parameter , implying that the more strongly blueshifted lines have a flattened rather than peaked profile .",
    "this result suggests the hypothesis that the narrow , symmetrical part of is an additional component that increases the equivalent width of the whole line when present , as well as reducing the cumulative offset from the rest wavelength .    to test this idea , we constructed a composite line consisting of the wind profile from iras  13224@xmath03809 , and a narrow and symmetric line that has a root - secant profile with a fwhm of @xmath38 and varying normalization .",
    "this fwhm was chosen because with it we could best match the relationship between kurtosis and asymmetry parameter ( dashed line in the second panel of fig .",
    "7 ) when used in combination with the iras  13224@xmath03809 wind profile .",
    "we assumed that the wind component has a fixed equivalent width , and that the narrow symmetric component contributes with strength varying from zero in the case of iras  13224@xmath03809 .",
    "we then measured the asymmetry parameter for these simulated line profiles , and infer an equivalent width by scaling the flux with that of iras  13224@xmath03809 .",
    "this relation is shown by the dashed line in the top panel of fig .",
    "surprisingly , despite the very simple assumptions , the correspondence is quite good .",
    "we note that at least one other factor should influence the line equivalent width : some objects have bluer continua than others .",
    "in fact , there is an anticorrelation between @xmath35 and the asymmetry parameter , such that objects with asymmetrical lines have bluer continua , and therefore would have a lower equivalent width for the same line flux .",
    "we note that this is not a clear manifestation of the anticorrelation between line equivalent width and luminosity ( the baldwin effect ; baldwin 1977 ) ; fig .",
    "8 shows that the objects with the lowest equivalent widths have mid - range luminosities .",
    "we discuss the baldwin effect further in section 3.4.3    the asymmetry parameter is anticorrelated with both continuum parameters @xmath37 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , objects with blueward asymmetric lines have relatively bluer uv continua and relatively lower x - ray flux .",
    "an exception is i  zw  1 , which appears to have a reddened uv continuum ( smith et al .",
    "1997 ) . this dependence can be directly interpreted in terms of resonance line - driven winds in agn . in such winds ,",
    "the acceleration comes from resonance scattering of the uv continuum from the central engine or accretion disk by ions in the wind .",
    "an intrinsically blue continuum provides more photons to be scattered ; thus a blue continuum should be associated with an asymmetric line profile , as is seen . both murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and proga , stone & kallman ( 2000 ) discuss the fact that strong soft x - ray emission tends to overionize the ions required for resonance scattering ; without these ions , the wind is suppressed .",
    "thus , lower x - ray flux should be associated with the presence of the asymmetrical line profile , as is observed .",
    "we note that very few of the uv and x - ray observations were coordinated , so relative variability between uv and x - ray observations adds noise to @xmath37 ; however , such noise would tend to decorrelate the parameters , rather than cause a false correlation .",
    "also , a few objects may be reddened ( e.g. , ark  564 ; crenshaw et al.2002 ) ; this would artificially increase @xmath37 .",
    "also , pg 1001@xmath29054 has a broad absorption line ( brandt , laor & wills 2000 ) , and a very steep @xmath37 , which may imply that the x - rays are absorbed .",
    "nevertheless , when the suspect objects are removed , the trend remains ( @xmath39% ) , tentatively supporting our hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , we note that our hypothesis is supported by the emission - line properties of two objects for which we do have simultaneous uv and x - ray observations ( re  1034@xmath039 : casebeer & leighly 2004 ; phl 1811 :",
    "leighly et al .  in prep .",
    "also associated with the asymmetry parameter and equivalent width is the equivalent width of ; objects with blueshifted have weak lines .",
    "this result has two interpretations .",
    "it may be a consequence of the fact that in any particular object , if one line has a high equivalent width , many of the other lines also have a high equivalent widths , possibly a result of a deficient continuum or large covering fraction , for example .",
    "however , there is another interpretation for the anticorrelation between the asymmetry parameter and the equivalent width . a weak line is generally considered to be smoking - gun evidence for a continuum weak in soft x - rays ; if this is the factor driving the correlation , it would also support the presence of a resonance - line driven wind , as mentioned above .",
    "interestingly , there is no similar correlation with the equivalent width of the stronger high - ionization line , .",
    "there is an weak correlation between equivalent width and @xmath35 , such that objects with lower equivalent widths have bluer spectra .",
    "this could be because bluer continua yield lower equivalent widths for the same line flux .",
    "stronger correlations are seen with the ratio of to .",
    "some of these may be related to correlations , but others are more strongly correlated with the ratio than with the alone .",
    "the anticorrelation between and the ratio of to may support the idea that objects having a wind may have selectively excited by ly@xmath7 ; this issue is discussed further in paper ii .",
    "several correlations are found between this ratio and properties of the intermediate - ionization lines ; these will be discussed in section 3.1.3 .",
    "we found a strong anticorrelation between the equivalent width and the profile asymmetry .",
    "it has been known for years that there exists generally an anticorrelation between agn emission line equivalent widths and luminosity ; this is known as the balwin effect ( baldwin 1977 ) .",
    "the physical origin of the baldwin effect has remained a puzzle for many years ; however , recent work suggests that it is a result of uv / x - ray continuum becoming softer as the luminosity increases ( dietrich et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this sample ,",
    "the correlations reported in table 3 between line equivalent width and the luminosity at 2500 are weak ; it may be that the correlations are not stronger because we probe only a limited range of luminosity .    in fig .",
    "8 we compare the relationship between @xmath40 and equivalent width for our sample with the regression obtained for a much larger sample by dietrich et al .",
    "we note that for the purpose of this plot , the luminosities were calculated assuming the cosmology used by dietrich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this plot is that , although there is still an anticorrelation between equivalent width and luminosity for nls1s , the relationship for many of the emission lines is offset from that of the average quasar ; for a given luminosity , nls1s have lower equivalent - width emission lines .",
    "this peculiar property of nls1s was previously reported by wilkes et al .",
    "interestingly , is the exception to the trend ; the equivalent widths from nls1s are consistent with those from the average quasar .",
    "1h  0707@xmath0495 and iras",
    "13224@xmath03809 have the smallest equivalent widths in the sample ; however , they have median luminosity , so their small equivalent width is not a consequence of the baldwin effect .",
    "interestingly , for some of the lines , the equivalent widths from these two objects is consistent with those of the other nls1s ; for other lines , they are markedly lower .",
    "eigenvector 2 is aligned along the equivalent widths of the ] and ; the equivalent widths of these lines are strongly correlated .",
    "mutual correlations are found between the ratio of ] to , the equivalent widths of and ] , and the ratios of ] and to ] .",
    "these interdependencies are illustrated in fig .",
    "what is the origin of these interdependencies ?",
    "we discuss this qualitatively here , and provide a more quantitative discussion , including photoionization modeling , in paper ii .",
    "first , it is possible that the trends reflect a difference in density of the line - emitting region .",
    "because of its low critical density of @xmath44 , ] is expected to decrease with respect to ] ( critical density of @xmath45 ) and ( a permitted line ) as the density increases .",
    "then , as density increases , ] and are expected to take over the cooling , resulting in an increase in both their equivalent widths and their ratios with respect to ] .",
    "however , an increase in density would predict a decrease in the ] / ratio , since the critical density of is @xmath46 .",
    "this would predict an anticorrelation between ] / and ] / ] , rather than the correlation that we observe .",
    "another possible origin of these trends is a variation in the ionization parameter .",
    "a decrease in ionization parameter predicts an increase in the ratio of ] to .",
    "it may conceivably produce larger equivalent widths of ] and , because their lower ionization potential allows them to be produced under lower ionization conditions , leading to larger ratios of ] / ] and / ] .",
    "there is another possible explanation that we discuss in much greater detail in paper ii ; photoionization modeling is presented there that supports this explanation .",
    "if we assume that the objects that have strongly blueshifted lines are characterized by the presence of a wind , it is possible that the continuum passes through the wind , or is `` filtered '' by the wind , before it illuminates the intermediate - ionization line - emitting region . after passing through the wind , the continuum will be somewhat weaker in the hydrogen continuum and will have very few photons in the helium continuum .",
    "such a continuum is effectively softer overall , and therefore lower - ionization species should dominate the cooling . as the continuum becomes softer , we see a decrease in the ratio of ] to , because the continuum is no longer hard enough to ionize c+2 efficiently . and ] then increase relative to ] because al+2 and si+2 have lower ionization potentials than c+2 .",
    "some of the intermediate - ionization emission line properties are correlated with properties of the high - ionization lines .",
    "there are strong correlations between / ] and / ] ratios and the asymmetry parameter ( fig.7 ) .",
    "this perhaps also supports the concept of filtering outlined above , since that can be interpreted as a shift of the cooling in the intermediate - line emitting region to ions with lower ionization potentials when a wind is present .",
    "we also see a correlation between the intermediate - ionization line ratios and the / ratio that is particularly strong for the ratio . because overlaps ly@xmath7 in the windy objects , it is possible that is selectively excited by ly@xmath7 in these objects .",
    "thus , this correlation could be interpreted as additional support for the filtering scenario outlined above .",
    "the velocity widths appear in the third eigenvector .",
    "the correlations between h@xmath1 , and ] velocity widths are not as strong as might be expected , as seen in fig .",
    "the scatter possibly originates in nonuniform measurement of the h@xmath1 widths ; many of these values were taken from the literature . also , the width of ] is difficult to measure , as it is blended with ] and uv 34 .",
    "we do observe a correlation between the velocity width of and the luminosity at 2500 .",
    "this correlation is expected , as objects with higher luminosities should have larger black holes and correspondingly blr velocities ( laor 1998 ) ; we discuss this correlation in a larger sample in leighly & moore 2004 ( in prep . ) .",
    "we also see anticorrelations between the ] / ratio and h@xmath1 velocity width , and the / ratio and velocity width .",
    "we have no ready explanation for these correlations .",
    "* we present a detailed analysis of the uv spectra from two narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , iras  13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 . we find that their continua are as blue as that of the average quasar .",
    "we observe that the high - ionization emission lines ( including and ) are broad ( fwhm@xmath47 ) , and strongly blueshifted , peaking at around @xmath48 and extending up to almost @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , the intermediate- and low - ionization lines ( e.g. , ] and ) are narrow ( fwhm 10001900@xmath50 ) and centered at the rest wavelength . ]",
    "is prominent , and other low ionization lines ( e.g. , and ) are strong . based on these observations , the working model that we adopt considers that the blueshifted high - ionization lines come from a wind that is moving toward us , with the receding side blocked by the optically thick accretion disk , and the intermediate- and low - ionization lines are emitted in the accretion disk atmosphere or low - velocity base of the wind . *",
    "the strongly blueshifted profile suggests that it is dominated by emission in the wind .",
    "we used the profile to develop a template for the wind .",
    "we then used this template , plus a narrow and symmetric component representing the disk emission to model the other bright emission lines .",
    "we inferred that the high - ionization lines and are also dominated by wind emission , and a part of ly@xmath7 is emitted in the wind .",
    "the intermediate- and low - ionization lines , ] , ] , and are dominated by disk emission , and a part of ly@xmath7 is disk emission as well . the 1400 feature , comprised of ] and was difficult to model ; however , it appears to include both disk and wind emission .",
    "* iras  13224@xmath03809 and 1h  0707@xmath0495 have distinctive x - ray properties among nls1s ; in order to determine whether their distinctive properties carry over to the uv , we analyzed _ hst _ archival spectra from 14 other nls1s with a range of two orders of magnitude in uv luminosity .",
    "we find indeed that these two objects are extreme in this sample in the following properties : strongly blueshifted line , the low equivalent widths of many of the lines , particularly and , high ] / , ] / ] , / ] , and / ratios , steep @xmath37 , and blue uv continuum . correlation analysis finds a number of strong correlations .",
    "an anticorrelation between asymmetry and equivalent width suggests that the line is generally composed of a highly asymmetric wind component and a narrower symmetric component .",
    "the anticorrelation between asymmetry and @xmath37 and @xmath51 , and with suggests that uv - strong and x - ray weak continua may be associated with a wind , as would be expected if the acceleration mechanism is radiative - line driving .",
    "the dominance of and ] over ] suggests possibly that the continuum is transmitted through the wind before it illuminates the intermediate - ionization line emitting gas . *",
    "paper ii investigates the physical conditions in the line - emitting gas through _ cloudy _ modeling of the disk and wind emission lines .",
    "the results are used , in combination with a toy dynamical model for the wind , to estimate the distance of the wind from the continuum emitting region .",
    "further discussion of the results is given , including a comparison with previous results .",
    "kml thanks many people for useful discussions , including fabrizio nicastro , and especially jules halpern and the ou agn group ( darrin casebeer , chiho matsumoto , & larry maddox ) .",
