    "in - medium change of spectral properties of heavy quarkonia is one of the interesting problems in recent hadron physics .",
    "firstly , the recent relativistic heavy ion collision experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) reveals exciting nature of the qcd matter through a number of observations @xcite . however , there are many open questions in both experimental facts and theoretical understandings of qcd matter . hence , it is important to establish appropriate experimental observables that reflect consequences of deeper theoretical understanding of the matter .",
    "heavy quarkonia have been regarded as one of the most suitable diagnostic tools in this respect , since the suppression of @xmath0 yields would reflect the debye screening phenomenon caused by the deconfinement phenomenon in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , as was originally argued by matsui and satz @xcite . until now ,",
    "quarkonium production , especially that of @xmath0 , in relativistic heavy ion collisions have been extensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , a remarkable progress comes from recent lattice qcd calculations , which indicate that contrary to the earlier expectation the @xmath0 will survive as a bound state even in the qgp up to @xmath7 @xcite , which was anticipated before based on the non - perturbative nature of qgp @xcite . nowadays",
    ", the state of matter at this temperature region has been characterized as `` strongly coupled '' qgp ( sqgp ) .",
    "hence , there will be change of spectral properties even for heavy quark system which has to be considered in interpreting experimental observables .",
    "secondly , charmonium in a nuclear medium is also an interesting issue . in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "we need knowledge of quarkonium - nucleon interaction to discriminate the suppression by qgp from the `` cold nuclear matter effect '' induced by such an interaction .",
    "furthermore , multi - gluon exchange can lead to an attractive interaction between @xmath8 and a nucleon , which may result in a bound state of charmonium and a light nuclei , as pointed out by brodsky _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "it should be also noted that the panda experiment at gsi - fair plans reaction of anti - protons with nucleus target , which will yield charmonia in the nuclear matter .",
    "it could serve as a testing ground for observing the precursor phenomenon of the qcd phase transition .    in this paper , we investigate change of mass and width of @xmath0 and @xmath1 induced by strongly interacting hot gluonic matter and by nuclear medium using qcd sum rule .",
    "qcd sum rule provides a systematic procedure for studying hadrons from a viewpoint of the asymptotic freedom in qcd @xcite .",
    "since the qcd sum rule can take non - perturbative effects into account through the condensate terms , it is a suitable theoretical tool of the current study .",
    "indeed , qgp at @xmath9 can not be understood using perturbation theory alone @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sum rule is more promising for heavy quark systems because we do not have to take the quark - antiquark condensate into account unlike light quark systems . in this respect ,",
    "the sum rule has been applied to charmonium and bottonium .",
    "established the framework in ref .",
    "@xcite and reinders _ et al .",
    "_ extended it to deep euclidean region @xmath10",
    "@xcite , in the case of vacuum . as for the quarkonia in - medium ,",
    "one of us together with furnstahl and hatsuda have investigated the mass shift of @xmath0 in hot hadronic matter @xcite , using a qcd sum rule approach , where the temperature effect was introduced to the perturbative wilson coefficient through the scattering terms .",
    "a consistent formalism at lower density was developed by one of us @xcite and independently by hayashigaki @xcite to study the mass shift of @xmath0 in nuclear matter .    along this direction , we investigated the mass shift and width broadening of @xmath0 in hot gluonic plasma ( gp ) @xcite just above the phase transition by consistently using the exact temperature dependencies of condensates from lattice calculation . in the present paper , as a subsequent paper to ref .",
    "@xcite , we present details of the analysis , further application to @xmath1 and to spectral changes in nuclear matter .    in the next section",
    ", we will give an explanation of the qcd sum rule for heavy quarkonium in medium used in the present work .",

    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "in this section , first we review the sum rule for heavy quarkonium in vacuum @xcite .",
    "then we introduce the extension to finite temperature and nuclear medium cases , in which medium effect is eventually induced only by the expectation values of gluonic operators without any additional change in the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "we start with the time - ordered current - current correlation function for @xmath11 channel @xmath12\\rangle,\\label{eq : correlation}\\ ] ] where we consider @xmath13 ( pseudoscalar ) and @xmath14 ( vector ) current of the heavy quark .",
    "namely , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for charm .",
    "the expectation value @xmath17 is taken for the vacuum .",
    "if we go to deep euclidean region @xmath18 , the product of the current can be expanded via operator production expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "if we denote @xmath19 such that @xmath20 for the vector current , @xmath19 can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the operators of mass dimension @xmath23 renormalized at scale @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the wilson coefficient . by virtue of much heavier quark mass than the confinement scale ,",
    "heavy quark operators , such as @xmath26 for dimension 4 , are rewritten in terms of gluonic operator with a factor of @xmath27 via heavy quark expansion @xcite .",
    "hence , only gluonic operators contribute to the ope for the heavy quark currents .    on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function is related to its imaginary part through the dispersion relation @xmath28 where we ignore @xmath29 in the denominator of the integrand since @xmath30 .",

    "and as @xmath31 we obtain the @xmath23-th order moment for the ope side @xmath32,\\label{eq : moment_ope}\\ ] ] and that for the phenomenological ( dispersion ) side @xmath33 here , we have introduced a dimensionless scale variable @xmath34 . in eq .",

    "these coefficients were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and we summarize them in the appendix .    in evaluation of spectral properties ,",
    "we take the ratio of the ( @xmath39)-th moment to the @xmath23-th moment and equate the ope side with the phenomenological side .",
    "then we obtain the sum rule @xmath40 which relates the hadron properties ( r.h.s . ) with asymptotically free qcd ( l.h.s . )      in this paper , we firstly consider the gluonic medium at finite temperature around @xmath4 . then , the expectation value in eq .   is taken as @xmath41 . hereafter , we set both medium and @xmath8 at rest .",
    "we denote @xmath42 and take @xmath43 limit . in this case",
    ", the transverse and the longitudinal components of the correlation function for the vector channel are simply related with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we denote the longitudinal component as @xmath46 for the vector channel .    at finite temperature , _ retarded _ correlation function is related to the spectral function @xcite . in the euclidean region @xmath47 ,",
    "the retarded correlation function @xmath48 becomes @xmath49 and the dispersion relation is given by @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the spectral function connecting with the imaginary part as @xmath52 then eq .   reduces to the vacuum case [ eq .",
    "] when @xmath53 has nonzero value only at @xmath54 .",
    "since we are interested in charmonia for which the mass is much larger than temperature considered here , this condition seems to be appropriate one . however , there are formally two additional terms in the finite temperature spectral function @xcite .",
    "one is the continuum part which also exists in the case of vacuum . following the prescription in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can suppress contribution from this part as described later because this part has finite values beyond some threshold .",
    "the other part arising from scattering of the current with quarks in medium is proportional to @xmath55 and the contribution grows up with @xmath56 in the hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "however , since we are considering the _ gluonic _ medium in which there are no ( anti-)quarks which annihilate with the current , such a scattering term does not appear .",
    "hence , we can use the same expression of the phenomenological side with the vacuum case [ eq .  ] for charmonia in the hot gluonic medium .    as for the ope side",
    ", there is an important change from the vacuum to the medium case .",
    "since we have no longer lorentz invariance , non - scalar operators have non - vanishing value @xcite . in the present case , twist-2 gluon operator has leading contribution and the @xmath23-th order moment of the ope side [ eq .",
    "] should be modified to @xmath57 ,   \\label{eq : moment_ope_medium}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the wilson coefficients and the medium expectation value for the twist-2 operator .",
    "since we are considering the heavy quark systems , only the condensate terms are temperature dependent as long as @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "hence , the wilson coefficients are the same as in the vacuum case . in the following , we show that the gluon condensates @xmath61 are written in terms of thermodynamic quantities which can be extracted from lattice qcd data .     taken from ref .",
    "the solid line is drawn by bezier interpolation of the lattice data points .",
    "the dotted line shows the case of eq .",
    ".,width=324 ]    if we define these condensate terms as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the 4-velocity of the medium and taken to be @xmath64 , explicit forms of @xmath61 are given as @xmath65 actually it is possible to calculate the condensates and directly using lattice qcd , but we do not adopt such an approach here .",
    "the gluon condensates generally consist of the perturbative piece and the non - perturbative piece . at zero temperature , the condensate term appearing in qcd sum rules is the non - perturbative piece only and it is shown that the non - perturbative part extracted from lattice qcd by subtracting the perturbative part is indeed consistent with the value of the condensate determined from qcd sum rules for charmonium @xcite .",
    "similar consideration holds also for the finite temperature case @xcite , in which we would have to subtract out the perturbative part at @xmath66 if we directly calculated the non - perturbative condensates from lattice qcd . in this paper , since we are putting all the temperature dependencies in the condensates , including the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions , we can just extract total temperature dependencies of the operators from the lattice .",
    "this is possible by noting that the scalar gluon condensate and twist-2 gluon condensates are respectively just the trace part and symmetric traceless part of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this energy momentum tensor is well calculated on the lattice from the pressure and energy density of the plasma through the following equation , @xmath67    the scalar condensate can be related to the trace part through the trace anomaly as @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the beta function , @xmath70 for 1-loop , @xmath71 flavors , and @xmath72 colors .",
    "using the above expression with @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the beta function and recalling that @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the value of the scalar gluon condensate in vacuum @xcite . as for the twist-2 part , the symmetric traceless part of the energy - momentum tensor is the gluon operator @xmath78 hence we can identify the traceless part of the energy momentum tensor to @xmath79 as given in eq .. > from eq .",
    ", the twist-2 part becomes @xmath80 so that @xmath81 is proportional to the entropy density of the system @xmath82 .",
    "we extract the temperature dependent quantities @xmath83 , @xmath84 @xcite and @xmath85 @xcite from lattice calculations for the pure su(3 ) system . in order to construct @xmath86 , we need the temperature dependent effective coupling constant",
    ". the coupling constant , however , can not be uniquely determined by lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented four kinds of the coupling constant extracted from the color singlet heavy quark - antiquark free energy .",
    "two of them are measured in the short distant regime and the others are done in the long distant regime . in the former , one is from the free energy and the other is from the spatial derivative of the free energy ( force ) .",
    "both coupling constants are almost independent of temperature at short distance , @xmath87 fm .",
    "while the former goes to negative value at larger distance due to the remnant of the confinement force , the latter shows temperature dependent maximum value , at which the distance is denoted by @xmath88 . here",
    ", we adopt the latter one , @xmath89 at @xmath90 as one of reasonable coupling constants since it characterizes the relevant length scale for the separation of short distance regime from long distance one . on the other hand ,",
    "the long distant regime is based on a fit of the free energy to the debye - screened functional form which has two coupling parameters , coulomb force strength @xmath91 and screening @xmath92 .",
    "although both of the coupling constants show reasonable temperature dependencies and agree each other at @xmath93 , we adopt @xmath92 because the coulomb force strength is not relevant for characterizing the long distance non - perturbative physics at temperature considered here .",
    "unlike @xmath94 , the uncertainty in the result of @xmath92 is too large .",
    "therefore , we use the 2-loop perturbative running coupling form @xmath95,\\label{eq : gpert}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 and rescale this as @xmath97 @xcite . here",
    "we put @xmath98 mev @xcite .",
    "the two coupling constants as a function of temperature are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "as explained later , we will consider only temperature region near @xmath4 in this paper .",

    "it becomes negative at higher temperature but remains positive in the temperature region considered here @xcite .      in this case ,",
    "the medium consist of nucleons , thus we do not have to worry about the scattering term . as far",
    "as we follow the same method to suppress the contribution from the continuum , we can use the same form of the phenomenological side with the vacuum and finite temperature cases .     for a comparison.,width=324 ]    thus , since the medium effect is similarly imposed on the gluon condensates , difference in the nuclear matter case from the case of hot gluonic matter is in the explicit form of @xmath61 . in order to evaluate the expectation value for the ground state of the nuclear matter ,",
    "we employ the linear density approximation @xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the normal nuclear matter density and the nucleon mass , respectively .",
    "the nucleon state @xmath105 is normalized as @xmath106 .",
    "then , the scalar condensate becomes @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 mev is the nucleon mass in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "the traceless and symmetric twist-2 operator is given as @xcite , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is related to the moment of the gluon distribution function @xmath111 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we take @xmath112 . while @xmath86 at finite temperature is related to the entropy , this correspondence does not hold in the nuclear matter case .",
    "note that eq .",
    "does not contain the quark sector . using these expressions , the condensate terms which appear in eq .",
    "finally result in @xcite @xmath113 the form of @xmath114 is the same as the hot gluonic matter case but now the expectation value is taken through eq .  .",

    "the twist-2 contribution is much smaller than that of the finite temperature case .      in the phenomenological side ,",
    "we use a simple prescription which describes the lowest lying resonance in each channel . for charmonium , previous studies @xcite focused on the mass and ignored the small but finite width of @xmath0 and @xmath117 .",
    "in this case , the imaginary part of the polarization function in eq .   is simply parametrized by @xmath118 where we ignore the channel subscript @xmath11 .",

    "is absorbed in @xmath120 . by taking the ratio as in eq .  , we can remove the constant @xmath121 from the equation . to obtain the mass of lowest lying resonance ,",
    "we need to choose sufficiently large @xmath23 such that @xmath122 is close to unity",
    ". then the ratio does not depend on the details of the correction term which contains higher resonances and continuum , and the mass is simply given by @xmath123 previous analyses rely on this formula .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the above formulation to include finite width . here , we employ the simple relativistic breit - wigner form @xmath124 as in the @xmath125 case , we can eliminate the unnecessary constant and the effects of the correction term by taking the ratio of the moment and choosing appropriately large @xmath23 . in the practical analyses of the sum rule ,",
    "our task is to find values of @xmath126 which satisfy the sum rule [ eq .  ] .",
    "generally there are infinite numbers of the pairs of @xmath126 because the sum rule provides one equation with respect to the two quantities which we want to know .",
    "hence , without additional constraints , the sum rule can provide only relation between @xmath127 and @xmath128 as in the case of light vector mesons @xcite . here , before the practical calculation",
    ", we discuss the relation between the mass and the width which comes from the phenomenological side , eq .  .    in calculation of the moment ratio of the phenomenological side , we need to compute the dispersion integral in eq .   with the spectral function in eq",
    "since the width of the ground state charmonium is much smaller than its mass , we need careful treatment in numerical integration . to achieve good accuracy , we performed monte - carlo integration based on the vegas algorithm @xcite . in our calculation , typical relative numerical uncertainty evaluated from the standard manner in the monte - carlo integration is order of @xmath129 for @xmath130 events with @xmath131 gev and @xmath132 mev .",

    "we show the result for two values of @xmath138 , @xmath133 and 3 . in each @xmath138 value , we choose two values of @xmath23 , of which are the typical values for the analyses below , to see @xmath23 dependence of the moment ratio .",
    "first , comparing the left ( smaller @xmath23 ) side to the right ( large @xmath23 ) side , we can see that @xmath128 dependence of the moment ratio becomes stronger as @xmath23 increases . as we will see later ,",
    "larger @xmath23 is suitable for evaluating mass at higher temperature .",
    "hence , this fact means that , as the temperature increase , the system becomes more sensitive to the width .",
    "second , the moment ratio decreases monotonically as the width increases if mass is unchanged .",
    "it also decreases as the mass decreases but the width dependence is much weaker .",
    "for instance , let us suppose that we obtain 1 gev@xmath139 decrease of the moment ratio from the ope side for @xmath133 .",
    "if mass stays constant , the width must broaden to larger than 100 mev while it corresponds to about 100 mev mass reduction in the case that the width remains in its vacuum value . finally ,",

    "but the values of @xmath23 which give the stability to the moment ratio also becomes larger .",
    "as previously reported in @xcite , the stability is only achieved near @xmath4 and the stronger coupling , which is @xmath94 in this temperature region , gives worse stability . by increasing @xmath138",
    ", we can improve the stability a little .",
    "while it is achieved only up to 1.04@xmath4 for @xmath143 , the moment ratio remains stable up to 1.06@xmath4 for @xmath136 .",

    "even the best case ( using @xmath142 and @xmath136 ) can stabilize the moment ratio only up to @xmath144 .",
    "note that the lack of stability does not necessarily mean dissociation of the charmonia .",

    "[ sec : gp ] , we have shown that mass decreases suddenly across @xmath4 and the shift reaches maximally a few hundred mev above @xmath4 in the hot gluonic matter . alternatively , width can also maximally broaden to @xmath6200 mev . although our analysis can not determine both of mass and width simultaneously , this is a notable result which should be examined in the present and future experiments .",
    "in fact , a next to leading order qcd calculation shows that the thermal width of @xmath0 slight above @xmath4 is smaller than a few 10 mev @xcite .",
    "hence a large mass shift will take place .",
    "note that such a large mass shift has been expected from different points view ; an ads / qcd analysis shows a sudden drop of mass at the phase transition @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the mass begins to slowly increase at higher temperature , the temperature region investigated in the present paper corresponds to the critical region .",
    "sudden reduction of the asymptotic value of the potential seen in lattice qcd @xcite leads to lowering of the bound state energy @xcite .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculation based on the maximum entropy method also shows survival of the peak in the spectral function above @xmath4 @xcite but the resolution is still insufficient to discuss shift and broadening of the peak .",
    "since our results access only near @xmath4 , we are still far from the complete understanding of the behavior of the charmonium in the deconfined medium . in the most plausible picture from the current understanding",

    "after charmonia are produced , they will dissociate by collisions with partons .",
    "if this phase lasts long enough compared to the inverse of the width , the charmonia can decay in the medium .",
    "in fact , the lifetime of the partonic medium is about 4 - 5 fm/@xmath148 in a hydrodynamic calculation for the central au+au collisions at the maximum rhic energy @xcite",
    ". this will be much longer at lhc . from fig .",
    "[ fig : resultjpsi1 ] , we expect @xmath149 mev @xmath0 mass reduction in the case of the small decay width . this shift is larger than experimental mass resolutions ( @xmath6 35 mev for dielectron channel of phenix at rhic @xcite , 33 mev for dielectron channel and 75 mev for dimuon channel of alice at lhc @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , statistical hadronization near phase boundary has been also examined @xcite . in this case",
    ", the number of produced charmonium will be enhanced if the notable mass shift occurs .",
    "for example , there may be a factor of 2 enhancement for @xmath150 mev and @xmath151 mev since the enhancement factor is given by @xmath152 , this enhancement might be observed by comparing particle ratio .",

    "@xcite to the one which takes account of finite width .",
    "we have also shown the results for different @xmath138 values .",
    "since we have given the relation between the mass shift and width , we can estimate the mass shift in the presence of finite width effect by considering the dissociation cross section of the charmonium by nucleon .",
    "provided the fermi momentum is @xmath153 mev and the cross section is @xmath154 mb , the decay width @xmath155 becomes @xmath156 mev for charmonium at rest .",
    "the cross section may be smaller , because the incident momentum is considered to be small and the process will be near threshold . from this estimate , if we take into account the broadening of the width , the mass shift becomes slightly smaller , by about 0.5 mev , according to the results shown in fig .",

    "we present some predictions for cross sections of charmonium production through @xmath161 annihilation and subsequent decay into dileptons or radiative decay in the experiment .",

    "@xmath169 is the spin of the incident particles , which are anti - protons and protons in the present calculation .",
    "since the target protons are in nucleus , we have to take the fermi motion into account for accurate estimation .",
    "we average the breit - wigner cross section with respect to target momentum as @xmath170    in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we also calculate cross sections for @xmath171 which are expected to show larger mass shift @xmath172 mev @xcite .",
    "parameters in the calculations are summarized in table  [ tbl : sigma_bw ] .",

    "results of the cross sections as a function of incident anti - proton energy are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma_jpsi]-[fig : sigma_chi2 ] .",
    "we can clearly see that sharp peaks of the resonances disappear .",
    "this is because of the fermi motion of the target protons in the nucleus .",
    "for example , incident energy to create @xmath0 ( 3097 ) is @xmath174 gev , but the fluctuation of the target momentum makes it possible to create @xmath0 with @xmath175 gev , in which the minimum and the maximum @xmath176 correspond to the target momentum along the collision axis @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively .",
    "this effect considerably broadens the cross section .",
    "consequently , one needs no fine tuning of incident proton energy to produce charmonium . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "mass shifts are so small that the peak positions of incident energy do not change .",
    "however , mass shift of @xmath171 , @xmath179 mev , is sufficiently large to show clear shift of the peak in the cross section . in these calculations ,",
    "we treat @xmath173 as a free parameter .",
    "it is shown that this parameter affects only on the magnitude of the cross section , which is larger for smaller change from the vacuum width . hence , though we can not predict both of mass shift and in - medium width , we can obtain information on both quantities from the experimentally measured cross sections .",
    "we summarized the cross sections and expected event rate at gsi - fair , of which luminosity is expected to be @xmath180 , in last two column of table .",
    "[ tbl : sigma_bw ] .",
    "we can see that the expected event rates are large enough for the mass shift of @xmath171 to be observed .",
    "finally we address possible improvements of this work .",
    "since we restricted ourselves to the hot medium which consists of gluons only in the first part of this paper , we should take the quarks into account for more realistic estimation .    to consider the quark effects , first we consider the quark operators appearing in the ope side .",
    "we can neglect the light quark contribution to the ope , because the light quark operators appear in the ope at order @xmath181 : this is why the light quark condensate can be neglected in the sum rules for heavy quark system . on the other hand , thermal heavy quarks that directly couple to the heavy quark current contribute to the ope at leading order .",
    "this is different from the heavy quark condensates that are perturbatively generated from the gluon condensates , and contribute to the ope through gluon condensates , whose wilson coefficients are calculated in the momentum representation .",
    "the direct thermal quark contributions are called the scattering terms .",
    "however , similar terms also appear in the phenomenological side , which also has free charm quark mode that is not coupled with a light quark in the form of a @xmath182 meson above @xmath4 as been recently studied in ref .",
    "therefore , the scattering term will cancel out between the ope side and the phenomenological side in the deconfined medium .",
    "second , the gluon condensates themselves can have a different temperature dependence in the presence of dynamical quarks . as discussed before , the important input for the mass and width change is the temperature dependence of gluon condensates in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc ] ; in particular the dominant contribution comes from the temperature dependence of @xmath99 . for that purpose , we note that the trace of the energy momentum tensor to leading order is given as ,    @xmath183    therefore , we start from the lattice calculation of the trace of the energy momentum tensor for the full qcd with realistic quark masses given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "then , we subtract the fermionic part of the trace anomaly , which was also shown in the literature , from the total .",
    "next , we divide the result for the relevant prefactor with @xmath184 multiplying the gluon condensate as given in eq .  .",
    "since the critical temperature @xmath185 differs , we compared it as a function of @xmath186 in which @xmath187 mev for the full qcd case  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : e3p_full ] , the magnitude of the resulting change near the critical temperature are remarkably similar between the full and pure gluon qcd ; although the slope at @xmath185 is milder for full qcd as a consequence of rapid cross over transition instead of the first order phase transition . since the change of the condensate sets in at a lower @xmath186 in the full qcd case ,",
    "the mass and width of charmonia might start varying at a lower temperature in the realistic case than in the pure glue theory . as for the twist-2 condensates",
    ", results will not be affected so much by taking into account the fermionic part since the effect will be small at this temperature region .",
    "therefore we believe our main argument and the quantitative result will not be alter even in the realistic situation .",
    "it is also important to study change of @xmath171 at finite temperature , which may influence the quantitative feature of the sequential melting @xcite , since non - negligible fraction of @xmath0 comes from decay of @xmath188 and @xmath171 in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "this can be done by calculating wilson coefficients for tensor operators for these channels .",
    "it should be also noted that the continuum part of the spectral function may play an important role .",
    "this will be possible by modeling the medium with a gas of quasi - particle .",
    "one more thing to be done is the extension to higher temperature .",
    "the failure of @xmath189 for @xmath0 and @xmath190 for @xmath1 originates from the instability of the moment ratio of the ope side . the twist-2 gluon condensates becomes larger as temperature increases and then leads to the breakdown of the stability in the ope side including up to dimension 4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ope_c ] ) and @xmath191 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ope_cof_a ] , we can also see that the expansion is not good at large @xmath23 that stabilize the moment ratio at higher temperature .",
    "these facts suggest the necessity of including higher dimensional operators , which is examined in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , we do not know a simple way to extract the temperature dependencies of the higher dimensional operators from the lattice calculation , as was done in the present work for dimension 4 operators . the other way of the extension is to improve the phenomenological side such that it includes temperature dependent continuum contribution .",
    "the decrease of the scalar gluon condensates above @xmath4 indicates perturbative contribution becomes more important at higher temperature .",
    "if we can construct a more appropriate phenomenological side reflecting the nature of the strongly interacting matter , it will lead to @xmath23-independent results for physical parameters until the charmonia really dissolve .",
    "we also note that there are some spaces to improve the analyses for nuclear matter .",
    "especially , the present analysis shows the mass shift of @xmath171 states are likely to be observed in the forthcoming experiment .",
    "however , the current estimate of the mass shift is not a decisive one ; we have to take the twist-2 contribution into account for a more accurate estimation .    in summary ,",
    "we have given a comprehensive analysis on medium - induced change of the spectral properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the hot gluonic medium and the nuclear medium by making use of qcd sum rules . in the case of the gluonic medium ,",
    "our analysis shows there must be a notable change of mass or width , or both around @xmath4 , caused by the rapid change of the gluon condensates .",
    "although the present formalism is found to be applicable only up to @xmath192 , the change of mass and width can maximally reach a few hundred mev .",
    "we have discussed its implication for future heavy ion experiment at cern - lhc . as for the nuclear matter case , we extend the past works to include small but finite width and check the robustness by varying the scale parameter of the theory .",
    "we also examined the possibility of detecting such mass shifts in the future experiment at gsi - fair .",
    "although @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not show prominent signals , @xmath171 exhibits more promising results .",
