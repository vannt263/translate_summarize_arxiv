    "the default ampt version , with a hadronic gas , does not result in a rapid increasing dependence trend . in the melt ampt version ,",
    "the dependence trend indicates the jet correlation information can be inherited by and transmitted to more particles in a partonic phase than in a hadronic gas , especially in `` large '' size collision system .",

    "it indicates that the jet correlation information can reach faraway relative to direction of jet with changing the collision system from `` small '' size one to `` large '' size in a partonic phase .",

    ", it can be concluded that a considerable `` large '' collision system is necessary and the strong parton cascade is essential for the formation of the double - peak structure of away - side correlation function .",
    "an onset of the observable double - peak structure occurs in the mass range of @xmath8ca + @xmath8ca collision .",
    "this phenomenon indicates that the correlation is sensitive to @xmath23 and @xmath14 , i.e. the correlation depends on the collision system size and the violent degree of the partonic interaction in a partonic phase .",
    "different results obtained in a partonic phase and a pure hadron gas imply the double - peak structure and jet modification are sensitive to the effective degree of freedom of the dense medium created in relativistic heavy ion collisions , which can give us some hints of the onset of deconfinement in the system - size viewpoint .",

    "the yields of associated particles , width of away - side correlation functions and splitting parameter show significant system - size dependence .",
