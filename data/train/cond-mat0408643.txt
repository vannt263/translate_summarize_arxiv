    "while it is accepted that electron correlation drives non - s - wave - pairing superconductivity , determination of detailed superconducting gap structure still remains a challenge for both theory and experiment . on a theoretical side , analyses starting at microscopic hamiltonians have succeeded in identifying gap structures of several materials . on an experimental side",
    ", it is getting recognized that field - orientational dependence of specific heat or thermal conductivity carries a considerable information on gap structure . since the low - energy density of states changes according to the angle between gap nodes and magnetic field , one can derive gap structure by tracing a change of thermodynamic quantities as sweeping magnetic field in several directions .",
    "actually , this method has been applied to a series of superconductors including sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8@xcite , cecoin@xmath9@xcite , @xmath10(et)@xmath7cu(ncs)@xmath7@xcite , yni@xmath7b@xmath7c@xcite , pros@xmath8sb@xmath11@xcite and upd@xmath7al@xmath12@xcite . however , their results left serious problems yet to be overcome .",
    "for example , in the case of sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 , thermal conductivity ( @xmath13 ) does not show any change with rotating magnetic field within the ab - plane , while specific heat ( @xmath14 ) shows clear four - fold oscillation . as to cecoin@xmath9 , @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 show incompatible behavior . in yni@xmath7b@xmath7c , both @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "show a cusp - like singularity as sweeping magnetic field within the superconducting plane .    in the previous paper",
    ", we addressed the problem of sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 in terms of the fine - structure of density of states@xcite . whereas , the latter two problems are left unsolved .",
    "while it is proposed that the cusp - like singularity in yni@xmath7b@xmath7c is caused by point node in gap structure@xcite , their discussion is phenomenological in nature and unreliable , as we will show .    the confusion as to the experiment is probably attributed to a lack of firm theoretical basis .",
    "so far , the experimental data has been usually interpreted in terms of the `` doppler - shift criterion '' .",
    "this criterion says _ larger density of states is obtained when a magnetic field is applied in antinodal rather than nodal directions .",
    "_ however , this criterion is obtained on the basis of the phenomenological doppler - shift method that can be justified only at a limit of low - magnetic field .",
    "hence , it is not clear whether this criterion is still valid in the experimentally accessible higher magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , in the previous paper , we showed that there occurs a crossover from doppler - shift predominant region at low magnetic fields to core states predominant region at high magnetic fields@xcite . in the core state predominant region , larger density of states is obtained for field in nodal direction , in contrast to the `` doppler - shift criterion '' .",
    "hence , in order to derive a correct nodal structure from the field - rotational experiments , it is highly desirable to establish a theoretical analysis applicable more widely .    to this end , we present a more quantitative analyses of the crossover behavior by taking account of the field - angle dependence of order parameter .",
    "in particular , we are interested in how the fermi surface or superconducting gap structures affect the crossover behavior .    furthermore",
    ", we would like to investigate field - orientational dependence of zero - energy density of states ( fodos ) in detail at the doppler - shift predominant region .",
    "it is interesting to clarify how information on nodal structure is obtained from the shape of fodos .",

    "we address the problem of cusp - singularity in yni@xmath7b@xmath7c . and section [ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we introduce an approximate analytical solution of the quasiclassical eilenberger equation , which was originally proposed by pesch@xcite , and recently extended to unconventional superconductors by dahm et al.@xcite . with this method ,",
    "one can obtain exact results at @xmath15 , and quantitatively reliable results to much lower fields .",
    "all our analyses in this paper are based on this approximate analytical approach .",

    "this equation provides a convenient method to analyze inhomogeneous state of superconductors by decoupling slowly varying order parameter from fast oscillating fermi - particle degree of freedom . in this paper , we limit ourselves to the case of spin - singlet superconductors in clean limit . under these conditions ,",

    "[ bolofodos1](b ) and fig .",
    "[ bolofodos2](b ) , we show contribution to fodos from each fermi surface .",
    "one can find that the fodos arising from the quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface is larger and dominate the contribution from the spherical fermi surface .",
    "it is surprising that only tiny anisotropy of fermi surface destroys the doppler - shift predominant region below @xmath192 .",
    "it makes a contrast with the single band case in section [ inplane ] where as much as 40% of fermi surface has to be nested to suppress the doppler - shift predominant region to @xmath193 .",
    "one can understand the origin of the enhancement of the contribution from the quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface , on the basis of the scenario in section [ isotropic ] . in section [ isotropic ] , we noted that largest contribution to fodos comes from the part of fermi surface where effective fermi velocity @xmath67 is nearly parallel to the field - rotational plane .",
    "in the case of cylindrical fermi surface in section [ isotropic ] , such parts are limited to @xmath194 due to anisotropic coherence lengths @xmath195 . however , in the two - band model in this section , the superconducting coherence lengths are isotropic ( @xmath196 ) , hence @xmath67 is almost parallel to the field - rotational plane all over the quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface .",

    "the cusp - like singularity shown here is basically owing to the co - existence of two - dimensional and three - dimensional fermi surfaces and to the nesting nature of two - dimensional fermi surface .",
    "this example shows that many cares are needed for an analysis of experimental data in the multi - band system .",
    "then , anisotropy of quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface is enhanced and invalidate the simple argument based on the doppler - shift methods .",
    "we study the influence of superconducting gap and fermi surface structures on the field - orientational dependence of zedos .",
    "first , we studied the crossover behavior of zedos , by taking account of the four - fold oscillation of @xmath83 , and found that there exists a crossover magnetic field @xmath2 so that @xmath3 for @xmath197 , while @xmath5 for @xmath6 , consistent with our previous analyses@xcite .    next , we have investigated the roles of gap structure and nature of fermi surface . the crossover behavior and fodos at the doppler - shift predominant region",
    "have been discussed .",
    "we found that there are no significant differences in neither the value of @xmath2 nor the shape of fodos between the spherical fermi surface and the cylindrical fermi surface , in spite of the difference in the dimensionality of fermi surface .",
    "we also found that when quadratic point nodes exist , @xmath2 is lowered than the line node cases and fodos has broader minima .",
    "these results can be coherently understood by recognizing that contribution to fodos mostly comes from the part on the fermi surface where effective fermi velocity is nearly parallel to the field - rotational plane .",
    "next , we examine the effects of in - plane anisotropy of fermi surface .",
    "we showed that the doppler - shift predominant region may be suppressed to lower fields by the anisotropy of fermi surface .",
    "this tendency becomes especially strong in a multi - band superconductor which has nearly isotropic coherence lengths .",
    "therefore , some cares are necessary for analyzing the field - rotational experiments for yni@xmath7b@xmath7c and cecoin@xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , the field - rotational experiment and its interpretation based on the doppler - shift criterion are powerful tool for such material as sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 , na@xmath198coo@xmath71.3h@xmath7o@xcite and organic superconductors , which are well described by a single fermi surface or have plural fermi surfaces with the same dimensionality .    finally , we propose a novel mechanism of the cusp - like minima found in yni@xmath7b@xmath7c , in terms of andreev bound states .",
    "the cusp - like minima are attributed to nesting in quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface and the isotropy of superconducting coherence lengths .",
