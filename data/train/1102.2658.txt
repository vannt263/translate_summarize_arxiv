    "<S> the wavefunctions proposed by laughlin@xcite first explained fqhe by introducing fractionally charged quasi - particles . </S>",
    "<S> later , the ideas of flux attachment and the composite fermi - liquid theory@xcite have provided us a rather simple and deep understanding for the nature of the fqhe . among many of its interesting and unique properties , </S>",
    "<S> two of the most striking features of fqhe are : ( 1 ) fractionalization , where quasi - particle excitations carry fractional quantum numbers and even fractional statistics of the constituent particles , and ( 2 ) topological degeneracy , where the number of degenerate ground states responds nontrivially to the changing of the topology of the underlying manifold . </S>",
    "<S> these two phenomena are the central ideas of the topological ordering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , on the potential application side , they are also the key components in the studies of topological quantum computation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since 1988 , great efforts have been made to study quantum hall effects in lattice models without landau levels@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> their essential topological properties can be understood within a noninteracting picture . however , for fqhe , interaction effects are expected to play the vital role in stabilizing these fractionalized topological states . in fact , without interactions , a fractional quantum hall system will become a fermi liquid due to the fractional filling factor .    most recently , a series of models with topologically - nontrivial nearly - flat band models have been proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these lattice models have topologically nontrivial bands , similar to haldane s model and z@xmath3 topological insulators , and their bandwidth can be tuned to much smaller than the band gap , resulting in a nearly - flat band structure . in particular , based on the mechanism of quadratic band touching  @xcite , a large class of flat band models have been explicitly obtained with the ratio of the band gap over bandwidth reaching the high value of @xmath4 . due to the strong analogy between these nearly - flat bands and the landau levels , </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured that in these models , fqhe ( or fractional topological insulators ) can be stabilized in the presence of repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the conjecture is challenged by competing orders , e.g. the charge - density wave , and thus the fate of these systems are unclear . </S>",

    "<S> physically , this can be understood as the particle at lower filling has enough phase space within the lower hubbard band , and thus the fqhe remains intact . </S>",
    "<S> it would be very interesting to establish a variational state for the fqhe on the flatband model , which will be investigated in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is important to emphasize that the fractional topological phases we found are very stable and the same effect survives even if the hopping strengths are tuned by an amount of @xmath77 . on the experimental side </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that checker - board lattice we studied can be found in condensed matter systems ( e.g. the thing films of liv@xmath3o@xmath78 , mgti@xmath3o@xmath78 , cd@xmath3re@xmath3o@xmath79 , _ etc _ ) , and the imaginary hopping terms we required can be induced by spin orbit coupling and spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this lattice model also has the potential to be realized in optical lattice system using ultra - cold atomic gases , in which the tuning of the parameters are much easier compared with condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> based on these observations , we conclude that there is no fundamental challenge preventing the experimental realization of these novel fractional topological states , but further investigation is still needed in order to discover the best experimental candidates . </S>"
