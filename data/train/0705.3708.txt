    "molecule based magnetic materials have been the subject of intense research , with the target of designing new magnetic materials@xcite .",
    "for example , novel quantum phenomena such as quantum tunneling of magnetization open up possible future applications in quantum computing and data storage @xcite . other interesting research directions",
    "are spin state transitions @xcite , or tuning of the magnetic coupling and the design of ferromagnets ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has led to an interdisciplinary effort in physics and chemistry , and by experimentalists and theoreticians .",
    "supramolecular complexes of transition metals with organic ligands can also be used to synthesize low - dimensional magnets .",
    "the organic ligands constitute magnetic superexchange pathways with a strength of the order of 1 to 100 kelvin .",
    "since pyrimidine and similar heterocycles ( pyrazine , pyridine ) are often found as magnetic exchange mediating molecules in metal - organic magnets ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is important to study in detail the electronic structure and magnetic exchange mechanism .     a cutout of the one dimensional chain of cu pm(no@xmath1)@xmath2 ( h@xmath2o)@xmath2.,width=340 ]    cu pm(no@xmath1)@xmath2 ( h@xmath2o)@xmath2 is a molecule based magnet which can be considered as a one dimensional spin chain ( see figure [ cupmbild ] ) .",
    "this complex was synthesized a few years ago @xcite .",
    "it has been studied by magnetic susceptibility , specific heat and electron spin resonance measurements @xcite .",
    "more recently , high field magnetization studies @xcite and @xmath3c nmr measurements were performed @xcite .",
    "it can be theoretically described as a @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with an exchange coupling of @xmath4=36 k @xcite , and with an additional dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and a staggered g - tensor @xcite .",
    "this model had also been used for other one - dimensional spin chain systems such as copper benzoate @xcite or cucl@xmath2 @xmath5 2(dimethylsulfoxide ) @xcite .",
    "earlier , a molecular orbital study based on the extended hckel approach had been performed to gain an insight in the origin of the magnetic interaction and to study the magnetic pathway @xcite .",
    "the extended hckel method can be viewed as a first step in the hierarchy of ab initio calculations .    in this article , we present a density functional study of this system , in order to obtain results based on first principles calculations , without using experimental data ( apart from the positions of the nuclei ) .",
    "the target is to get an understanding of the charge- and spin distribution by an analysis of spin density maps and a calculation of the individual magnetic moments . by computing the energy difference between ferro- and antiferromagnet ,",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath4 can be extracted .",
    "in addition , nmr parameters such as the isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine interaction parameters are computed and compared with recent experimental values .",
    "the aim is to get an understanding of the counter - intuitive experimental result , that an atom with a relatively large distance to the magnetic ion has a larger isotropic shift than an atom closer to this magnetic ion .",
    "the density functional approach allows to obtain all these properties on equal footing .",
    "the calculations were done with the code crystal2003 @xcite .",
    "this code employs a local basis set made of gaussian type functions . for cu , a @xmath6 $ ] basis set @xcite , for o a @xmath7 $ ] basis set@xcite ( with outermost @xmath8 exponents of 0.5 and 0.191 ) , for n as @xmath9 $ ] , for c a @xmath9 $ ] , and for h a @xmath10 $ ] basis set was chosen ; the latter three basis sets were as in @xcite .",
    "full potential , all electron density functional calculations with the local density approximation ( lda ) and with the hybrid functional b3lyp were performed .",
    "these calculations were done for the ferro- and antiferromagnetic state , where the resultant solution of the kohn - sham equations is an eigenstate of @xmath11 , but not of @xmath12 .",
    "the energy difference was therefore fitted to an ising model , in order to estimate the exchange coupling @xmath4 . from the computed spin density , the isotropic and the anisotropic hyperfine coupling parameters are extracted .",
    "the charge and spin of the individual atoms are obtained via the mulliken population analysis .",
    "in table [ mullikenfm ] , the mulliken populations of the ferromagnetic solution are displayed .",
    "copper carries a charge of @xmath13 + 1.6 , i.e. less than a formal charge of + 2 .",
    "consequently , the total spin is @xmath13 0.7 , which indicates that the spin is delocalized to the neighboring atoms .",
    "concerning the pyrimidine ring , we notice that the nitrogen atoms are negatively ( -0.7 ) and the carbon atoms positively charged , so that the ring as a whole is positively charged ( 0.3 ) .",
    "the charge on no@xmath1 is @xmath13 -0.9 , and h@xmath2o is approximatively neutral .",
    "the largest spin on the pyrimidine ring ( @xmath13 0.1 ) is located on the nitrogen atoms of the pyrimidine ring which are neighbors to the copper ions . comparing lda and b3lyp",
    ", we note that the lda solution gives a slightly more delocalized picture .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings , e.g. @xcite where it was shown that lda overemphasizes delocalization .",
    "the spin in the pyrimidine ring is alternating up and down , consistent with the idea of a spin polarization mechanism .",
    "looking at the individual sites , for c1 and c3 essentially the @xmath14-orbitals carry the spin , whereas for c2 the c @xmath15 orbital carries a little more spin .    in table",
    "[ mullikenaf ] , the corresponding results for the spin of the antiferromagnetic solution are displayed .",
    "the charges are virtually identical to the charges of the ferromagnetic solution and thus not displayed .",
    "the total spin is similar to the ferromagnetic case for the copper atom , and for the nitrogen atoms of the pyrimidine ring ( apart from the sign , obviously ) .",
    "the spin is zero for the c1 and c2 sites due to the symmetry . for the c3 site ,",
    "there is in the case of the lda a very small spin , parallel to the spin of the nearest copper , in contrast to the ferromagnetic case , where the spin is antiparallel .",
    ".[mullikenfm ] results from the mulliken population analysis for the ferromagnetic solution . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "density functional calculations on the molecule based magnet cu pm(no@xmath1)@xmath2 ( h@xmath2o)@xmath2 were performed , using the local density approximation and the hybrid functional b3lyp .",
    "the exchange path via the pyrimidine ring was analyzed with spin density plots and with a mulliken spin population .",
    "the calculations prove a spin transfer from the cu atom to the adjacent nitrogen atoms as had been deduced from the nmr experiments .",
    "the spin of the nitrogen atoms in the pyrimidine ring is parallel to the copper spin in all cases . in the ferromagnetic case ,",
    "the spin on the pyrimidine ring is alternating .",
    "the carbon atoms c1 and c3 have a spin essentially in the @xmath14 orbitals , and on the c2 site also a slightly larger spin is found in the carbon @xmath15 orbital . in the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "the spin is virtually zero on all the carbon atoms .    in the case of the antiferromagnet ,",
    "the charges of the two nitrogen atoms of the pyrimidine ring can stronger interpenetrate .",
    "this delocalization reduces the energy and explains why antiferromagnetism is observed .",
    "in addition , the isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine interaction parameters were computed . for the isotropic parameters ,",
    "a qualitative agreement could be observed with the b3lyp functional .",
    "especially , the experimental result that the isotropic hyperfine coupling is largest at the c2 site , which has the largest distance to the magnetic ion , could be confirmed .",
    "it is suggested that this is due to the relatively large contribution to the spin density from the @xmath15 orbital for the c2 site . in the case of the anisotropic dipolar hyperfine tensor , a good agreement with the experimental data was found for both functionals , where again b3lyp performed better .",
    "finally , the exchange coupling was computed via the energy difference between ferro- and antiferromagnetic state .",
    "a reasonable agreement was found at the b3lyp level , whereas the local density approximation results in by far too large values of @xmath4 due to an enhanced delocalization , which is a well known problem of exchange couplings computed with the lda .",
