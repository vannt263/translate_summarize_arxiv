    "the electrical activity of a living system is a dynamic function of the ionic transport across biological membranes .",
    "ion channels are pore - forming protein ensembles that are responsible for the task of regulating ion flows .",
    "gating arises as conformational changes in the proteins that comprise the channel .",
    "these conformational changes are driven by changes in the electric field or by molecules ( ligands ) that bind to them .",
    "for this reason , ion - channels are often classified into voltage - gated and ligand - gated categories .",
    "voltage - gated ion channels have charged domains that make their structure sensitive to variations in the external electric field . for a particular range of membrane potentials ,",
    "they adopt a conformation with a central hole : forming a channel for the free movement of ions .",
    "such an ` open ' state is further defined by certain ` selectivity filters ' ( often amino acids ) that would render specificity for the protein @xcite . at other membrane potentials , the flow of ionic current",
    "is blocked as a result of the ` closed ' or ` inactive ' conformations that the protein adopts . a channel protein can thus adopt various conformational states with varying degrees of conductance , and they can spontaneously switch between these states . the steady distribution and dynamics of such switches is central to any study that involves an ion channel .    equation based kinetic models are useful to interpret the behaviour of a channel in a given situation . starting with the model of hodgkin and huxley @xcite ,",
    "several researchers have developed theoretical frameworks that partially explain observations made on channel activity .",
    "the hodgkin - huxley formalism relies on an underlying model of average channel conductance and their equations describe the changes of ionic permeability with membrane potential .",
    "the model makes use of hypothetical gating particles to bring about the channel s function , by forcing their motion with respect to the electric field across the membrane .",
    "although this model has been used in many instances , hypothetical gating particles do not appear to be consistent with underlying molecular mechanisms .",
    "further developments in the study of ion - channels made an attempt to give a mechanistic description of the gating phenomena .",
    "such models consist of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , including a current balance equation and the dynamics of conformational transitions incorporated as a ` gating variable ' that corresponds to the state of the ion channels .",
    "discrete - state markov models have been used to describe the different states of the ion channel @xcite and have the advantage of providing a mechanistic description for the otherwise abstract hodgkin - huxley formalism based models .",
    "markov chain models are developed on the assumption that ion channels exist in a finite number of significant energy states , with time - homogeneous rates of transition between them .",
    "the model consists of a topology of allowed transitions between these states , together with the rates for these transitions .",
    "fitting single - channel recording data with a markovian kinetic scheme has been standard in neurophysiology for quite some time @xcite . however , for good agreement with experimental data , frequently the number of closed states needed varies with the experimental protocol .",
    "a significant benefit of markov models compared to the hodgkin - huxley formalism is that the large degree of freedom in the model stucture allows it to fit more closely with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic models are a two state markovian description of channel flipping , the rate kinetics of which are described by concepts in thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "fractal models @xcite of ion channel gating provide a different description of the underlying mechanism compared to markov models .",
    "such models are characterised by equations having continuous rather than discrete states .",
    "the diffusion models introduced by millhauser et al .",
    "@xcite , justify fractal models at a microscopic level . statistical analysis , however has often favored markov models over fractal models @xcite .    a major hurdle in modelling ion - channel gating using a markov - jump scheme is in the determination of an appropriate number of closed states .",
    "as the topology space expands with the number of states , generating appropriate kinetic schemes can give rise to ambiguity because it may be possible to come up with multiple schemes that are consistent with a given set of data .",
    "moreover , numerical simulation of such models becomes time - consuming .",
    "thus the model has limitations from the point of view of parameter estimation and further in its use for multi - cellular simulations @xcite .",
    "the increasing complexity of the topology generates a need for model reduction .",
    "kienker @xcite talks about the existence of equivalence in topologies of models that are identifiable within the same data set .",
    "this would imply that models with a larger number of states are reducible .",
    "keener @xcite illustrates the possibility of reducing the complexity to stable invariant manifolds",
    ". this approach would reduce the dimension of the system without suffering from large approximation errors .",
    "furthermore , the time scale of the markovian transitions are much faster than the main time scales involved in the aggregate cell voltage and ion behaviour @xcite , which in turn offers options for model reduction .",
    "another difficulty in the acceptability of ion channel models is related to parameter identifiability .",
    "a model is said to have structurally unidentifiable parameters when multiple parameters are equally powerful in explaining observed data in noise - free perfect experiments @xcite . since it is well - known that a large segment of ion - channel models in the literature lack parameter identifiability in noise experiments @xcite , fundamental studies of structural identifiability are scarce due to the difficulty of solving the associated symbolic set of equations @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted that in usual experimental protocols optimised to improve the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite , provide two sets of separated data : one used to characterise the steady - state , and the other with time constants , when dynamics are not sufficiently fast to be disregarded . with this in mind , hodgkin - huxley models employ empirical expressions for both steps that are not always realistic @xcite . on the other hand , estimation in models based on markov chains",
    "often make use of other types of experimental protocols , and do not exploit the large range of data available using the standard protocols .    in this article",
    ", we describe a voltage - gated ion - channel model of stationary conductance with three main characteristics .",
    "to begin with , the model has a clear mechanistic motivation based on the underlying thermodynamics .",
    "in addition , the model is relatively simple to implement , with a small number of easily identifiable parameters . finally , we test the model using experimental data from patch clamp and similar studies reported in the literature .",
    "our model can make use of classical experimental protocols and provide a mechanistic formulation for the calibration of steady - state characteristics in the hodgkin - huxley setting and , by identifying the form of the stationary distribution , constrain the estimation process in markov processes , where the study of global structural identifiability is still an open problem .",
    "in addition , the simple model proposed here can be applied to study the gating of fast ion channels , such as fast persistent and fast activated na@xmath0 currents or transient activated k@xmath0 current @xcite .",
    "the probability of a protein molecule adapting a particular conformation in space is largely influenced by the electrical force field surrounding it .",
    "when subject to an electric field , charged groups within a protein will experience a force and may attain a new electrostatic equilibrium by incorporating angular changes in the dipoles associated with the peptide bond @xcite . if the thermodynamic kinetic energy is large enough to overcome the energy barrier , the protein takes up a new conformational state .",
    "proteins can hence take up a large number of conformational states separated by small energy barriers . despite the continuum of intermediate states ,",
    "this dynamical system would typically have only a few stable equilibria @xcite and hence a limited number of experimentally observable states .",
    "the rate at which the protein switches between such stable states is mainly determined by the driving forces that help in overcoming the thermodynamic energy barrier .",
    "however , there are some conformational changes that are not regulated by either electric field or ligands .",
    "they may be considered to have a constant energy barrier in the given environment , and hence may be thought to have a uniform rate .",
    "classical thermodynamics identifies the rate of transition between two reaction states based on the free energy barrier between them as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the rate of transition between the two states , @xmath3 is a constant , _",
    "@xmath4 g _ is the free energy barrier between the two states , @xmath5 is the universal gas constant and @xmath6 the absolute temperature .    more generally , the free energy barrier may be dependent on the electric field , that is , the membrane potential @xmath7 ( figure [ fig : gibbs ] ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath8 here _",
    "@xmath4g(v ) _ is the free energy barrier between the two states defined by the voltage @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath9 , are a function of the free energy barriers ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) defined by structural configurations of the respective states .",
    "the figure describes how the open probability of a channel is enhanced by a change in the ambient voltage from @xmath12 to @xmath13 by virtue of its conformational energy . ]    in the case of voltage based transition , the activation energy can be expressed in a general form by using a taylor series expansion @xcite , as follows : @xmath14 and the rate of transition _",
    "k(v ) _ may be written as , @xmath15 here @xmath16 corresponds to the free energy independent of the electric field and @xmath17 corresponds to interactions between the electric field and isolated charges and rigid dipoles on the protein .",
    "the higher order terms correspond to the influence of polarization and deformation within the protein structure as well as mechanical constraints .",
    "these effects are usually negligible as the trans - membrane voltage variations are generally small @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we are mainly interested in models where the free energy barrier is linear in the membrane potential .",
    "the effect of temperature variations may be neglected for the system under consideration , as long as the physiological environment remains unaffected . in this case , the following trivial lemma , helps us derive a simple expression for voltage regulated conformational transitions .",
    "[ lemone ] consider a set @xmath18 of activation energies , where each @xmath19 is affine in v. denote the corresponding transition rates by @xmath20 .",

    "this sigmoidal function of voltage is symmetric about the half - activation voltage , @xmath33 .",
    "however , experimental data frequently show one or both of : ( i ) activation and inactivation behaviour ( ii ) asymmetric behaviour , and hence it is hard to fit data with a single boltzmann function .",
    "this implies that the two - state markov chain with linear energy barriers does not ably model experimental observations .",
    "three possible ways to resolve this are ( i ) model the system as having more than two macro - states ( stable conformational states ) , ( ii ) model the system as having transition rates that change with the dwell times , leading to a fractal model ; or , ( iii ) use non - linear terms in the energy expression .",
    "we focus on the first option here for the following reasons . the second option ( ii )",
    "would give rise to time - inhomogeneous markov chains , which are typically very difficult to analyse .",
    "moreover , the identification task becomes less tractable in this case . as mentioned previously , the last option ( iii ) includes higher order terms that are usually neglected .",
    "also , as we shall see later in section ( [ sec : nl ] ) the use of higher order non - linear energy models does not appear to result in simpler models , nor does it give more accurate fits to experimental data .",
    "in fact , usually models developed on the basis of markovian dynamics have more than three states [ option ( i ) ] for a good agreement with experimental observations @xcite . in such models the rate constant",
    "is often defined with an exponential or a boltzmann function in voltage , both obtained from a linear approximation of equation .",
    "we will now analyse how best we can extend the two - state model by option ( i ) to have a network with limited and identifiable macro - states .",

    "the estimation of the open - state probability of voltage - gated ion channels to an equation of form as ( [ eq : msum ] ) would rather be equivalent to a steady - state approximation of the hodgkin - huxley formalism .",
    "however , as we seek to look beyond the hodgkin - huxley formalism for a good mechanistic description , the given model need to be compared with efforts made to represent the system on a realistic perspective .",
    "thermodynamic formalism comes closest to this effort .",
    "although the fundamentals are in place , such models @xcite show very poor performance in even small extrapolations from the given data ( figure [ fig : therm ] ) .",
    "we would also argue that the biophysical basis of the multiple conformation model is much clearer than that of a taylor s series dual conformation model .",

    "it should be noted that in work @xcite was also able to get acceptable fits with two transitions .",
    "the problem with this model however seems to be in the existence of unidentifiable parameters , as is the case with majority of the existing markov models @xcite .",
    "further , if no manipulation is carried out to collect group of parameters that are no identifiable only with stationary data , the model asks for fitting a minimum of twelve parameters ( provided two macro - transitions ( @xmath121 ) gives acceptable fits ) .    a mathematical model for a biological phenomenon",

    "conventionally , ion - channel data has limited interpretations by producing indistinguishable models @xcite . in - silico",
    "representation of ion - channel dynamics is yet to come up with a model for the reason that the model structure needs to be tweaked each time to incorporate experimental observation .",
    "this indeed is a question of parameter identifiability .",

    "proof : _ see [ app : c ]",
    "in this article , we bring forth an important criterion in modelling ion channel activity using markov jump schemes .",
    "we propose that the behaviour of the system may be developed by an analytical design that is simple and adaptable ; and towards this , a minimum of three markov states are necessary to model the dynamics .",
    "to illustrate the criterion , we describe the physical transitions of a particular class of voltage gated ion channel proteins by means of free energy changes associated with perturbations in its environmental electric field from a thermodynamic perspective . for this class of ion - channels we assume the existence of a unique simple path of transition , from every stable state to the open state .",
    "the resulting model is a simple kinetic expression ( equation [ eq : middleton ] ) which approximates the stationary open probability of the channel for a given membrane potential and is a generalized form of the single exponent modified boltzmann s function .",
    "the model proposed in this article , is identifiable and requires small number of parameters compared to existing models .",
    "this would in turn reduce the computational cost associated with regular markov models , without compromising much from the mechanistic viewpoint .",
    "its main limitation is that it has been developed for steady - state data and may not represent ion - channel dynamics in its entirety but only fast ion channels . nonetheless ,",
    "when dynamics are relevant , the proposed scheme may be extended and the resulting model calibrated by using voltage - current data from classical experimental protocols .",
