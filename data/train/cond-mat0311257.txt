    "the minority game ( mg ) @xcitehas addressed many issues to understand complex systems with special emphasis on modelling market mechanism .",
    "although the minority game is a very simple model , it contains the main ingredients to reproduce a rich behavior such as that observed in financial market @xcite .",
    "these features arise from relatively simple rules used to define the interaction of agents . in particular",
    "the mg assumes that market interaction is such that it pays to be in the minority .",
    "this assumption was recently challenged by andersen and sornette @xcite who derived a different market payoff considering the profits of round - trip transactions ( buy / sell or sell / buy ) .",
    "a round - trip requires at least 2 transactions and hence the market payoff depends on the price at two different times , i.e. on the action of traders at different times .",
    "the traders in the model introduced by andersen and sornette , called $ -game model , use this market payoff to judge the performance of their strategies .",
    "this leads to a market behavior which is very different from that of the minority game .",
    "in particular traders using the correct market payoff are found to perform better than those who base their behavior on the mg payoff .",
    "this models was analyzed also by jefferies and johnson @xcite , that discuss different aspects of market models .",
    "a key observation is that , in the $ -game the real market payoff is assessed on the basis of virtual trading : round trip transactions are used to evaluate trading strategy , but they are not actually implemented by traders .",
    "for example , if an agent bought some shares of asset at time @xmath0 , she / he will consider the virtual payoff of selling these shares at the current price at time @xmath1 , without actually selling it .",
    "using virtual trades to asses market payoff might be a realistic behavioral assumption .",
    "irrespective of this , a key issue is to understand what are the consequences of this assumption on the collective behavior of the market .",
    "more precisely , how does market s behavior differs if agents use virtual or real trades to asses market payoffs ?    the nave arguments which suggests that the difference is very small , contends that prices depend very weakly on a particular trader s transaction . whether a transaction was really carried out or not should not affect much the aggregate behavior .",
    "these type of arguments are known to be problematic in heterogeneous agent market models , and indeed fail both in the majority @xcite and in the minority game @xcite as well as in other asset market models @xcite . in other words , while the impact of each trader may be small on the aggregate , the effect of all traders neglecting their impact can be dramatic .",
    "we shall come to a quite similar conclusion , namely that virtual or real trading makes a difference in market s behavior .",
    "more precisely , we show that when agents use round - trip transactions both in the definition of market payoff and in their actual behavior we recover a behavior which is similar to that of the mg .",
    "indeed round - trip transactions induces anti - correlations in market returns and ref .",
    "@xcite show that market payoff reduces to those assumed in the mg when the market returns are anti - correlated .",
    "in order to do this we need to introduce slightly more complex models based on two times : decision making consists on a round - trip action where the agents decide to buy or sell at time @xmath1 and do the opposite ( sell or buy ) at time @xmath2 , then they evaluate the result in the next time step .",
    "in addition to this we also aim to studying the interaction between different types of traders , using the minority , majority or $ -game payoff .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:1 ] we derived the market payoff following ref .",
    "@xcite and we discuss the key observable . then we analyze single time models in section [ sec:2 ] and then we move to two times models in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "homogeneous populations and mixed populations are studied .",
    "finally we give some concluding remarks in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "now we will derive the minority and the majority mechanism from the market s dynamics . a single step in the minority game model",
    "could be split in three stages .",
    "first of all , at time @xmath3 the agent submits an order @xmath4 ( buy or sell ) that is going to be useful in computing the aggregate value @xmath5 , at time @xmath1 . at time @xmath6",
    "the agents update their experience simply by evaluating the success of their action . focusing on one agent @xmath7",
    ", we can assert that if @xmath8 he / she contributes with 1 $ to the market demand and if @xmath9 he / she contributes with @xmath10 for the supply where @xmath11 is the price of the cost transaction .",
    "the total demand and supply are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 units of assets respectively .",
    "then following the paper @xcite , let s fix the price @xmath14 in such a way that the demand matches the supply , i.e. , @xmath15 let s discuss how the market payoff is defined . to reward someone for their decisions we need to wait at least two successive transactions . for example , if one buys a stock for the price @xmath11 only later , at time @xmath16 when the price will be @xmath17 , we are able to know if buying was profitable .",
    "so the market payoff has an inter - temporal nature which depends at least on two prices .",
    "we can consider for agent @xmath7 the capital @xmath18 , which quantifies the agent wealth at each time step .",
    "this quantity depends on the the amount of money @xmath19 and asset @xmath20 which she / he owns at time @xmath1 , and the current price @xmath11 .",
    "suppose the agent @xmath7 decides to buy stocks @xmath8 at price @xmath14 , so the position changes to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , if the decision was to sell stocks , so @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in a compact way",
    ", we can express the same result as @xmath25 after a simple algebra we obtain the capital increment , @xmath26s(t)\\label{cap1}\\ ] ] which means that there is no gain from a single transaction apart from capital gain .",
    "then gain is due to a price changing .",
    "now consider that @xmath27 .",
    "this results in : @xmath28 the capital will be update by    @xmath29s(t)+q(t+1)r(t)\\frac{a(t+1)a(t)}{n } \\label{cap2}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath30    are constants of order 1 if @xmath31 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ cap2 ] ) the first term corresponds to the capital gain . from the second term",
    "we derive the payoff update @xmath32 as proposed by andersen , et.al @xcite .",
    "previously , giardina , et .",
    "al @xcite proposed a quite similar payoff function on their models .",
    "@xcite observes that , at time @xmath1 the agent does nt know the excess demand @xmath33 .",
    "however he / she may resort to the expectation given by the operator @xmath34 $ ] to evaluate the best decision to make on time @xmath1 . assuming that @xmath35=-\\phi_{i}a(t)\\ ] ] where linearity is assumed for the sake of simplicity , the expected payoffs increment @xmath36 of agent @xmath7 is @xmath37=e_{i}[a_{i}(t)a(t+1)|t]=-\\phi_{i}a_{i}(t)a(t ) \\label{eu}\\ ] ]",
    "the stationary state can only occur when the expectation is consistently validated by the dynamics as show in @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath38 for all @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath39 the agent @xmath7 believes that the price fluctuates around some equilibrium ( fundamental ) values @xmath40 .",
    "this trader is called fundamentalist and as we can see in the eq .",
    "( [ eu ] ) she / he plays as a minority game @xmath41 player for whom the payoff is @xmath42    on the contrary , if the agent believes that the price is following a trend , a movement @xmath43 will likely be followed by fluctuations of the same sign , i.e , @xmath44 .",
    "these agents , called chartists , play like in a majority game ( @xmath45 ) and the payoff is just @xmath46    whether @xmath47-game is approximate by minority game or majority game depends on the sign of @xmath48 .",
    "we shall use the superscript @xmath49 in the following to differentiate the results found in the different models .",
    "in this section we will discuss three agent models that simulate different trader s behaviors and interactions in the stock exchange market .",
    "the set up are the same for all models , differing only by the payoff function that ranks their strategies . in a generic description , consider @xmath50 odd agents that buy or sell stocks , goods , currencies , etc ... , to profit from the market price fluctuation .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a discrete time .",
    "each trader is endowed by @xmath51 quenched strategies randomly generated at the beginning .",
    "to each strategy each trader attaches a score @xmath52 which she / he updates in the course of time . at each time",
    "@xmath1 , she / he undertakes the action recommended by the highest scored strategy @xmath53 .",
    "the action @xmath54 taken by agent @xmath7 also depend on the value @xmath55 of a public information variable .",
    "after that , all these orders are collected to compose the excess demand @xmath56 . finally all agents update all the payoff function @xmath57 according to eq .",
    "( [ dg ] ) , ( [ menor ] ) or ( [ maior ] ) respectively for $ -game , minority game or majority game .",
    "the information @xmath55 is updated according to the outcome @xmath43 of the market : @xmath58    note that @xmath59 never occur when n is odd . in this way",
    "@xmath55 encodes in its binary representation the signs of the last @xmath60 outcomes @xmath61 of the market .",
    "graphically eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) describes a processes on the so called de - bruijn graph .",
    "this is a directed graph of @xmath62 nodes with directed links from nodes @xmath63 to nodes @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite .    to fix notation",
    ", we denote a temporal average of a given time dependent quantity @xmath66 as @xmath67 if we decompose this quantity into a conditional average on histories , we rewrite as    @xmath68    finally the average on the realization is denoted by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of realization .",
    "the main free parameter to study the stationary state of the system is @xmath71 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us now analyze the behavior of the different models .",
    "the autocorrelation is the key to explain the others quantities for single models and to understand the trader behavior . in the fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] the autocorrelation of the global action @xmath43 for the minority game is plotted as a function of @xmath72 for memory @xmath73 .",
    "all runs were equilibrated for @xmath74 times steps and run for 30000 times steps .",
    "we fix attention to the case of agents with @xmath75 strategies . for the minority game",
    "the autocorrelation is zero for @xmath72 much large than the critical point @xmath76 and the global performance is similar to the random game .",
    "this happens because the number of players is small compared with the amount of information available in the market ( for a discussion of minority game behavior see ref .",
    "@xcite . increasing the number of traders ,",
    "globally they start to exploit the information and coordinate their action until the occurrence of a phase transition .",
    "intrinsically minority players have a non imitative behavior , thus the autocorrelation becomes negative below the critical point .",
    "conversely , the majority players are trend follower and they induce a positive autocorrelation in @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "what can we expect for @xmath47-game ?",
    "[ fa1 ] shows that the $ -game is characterized by a positive autocorrelation @xmath77 .",
    "hence we expect(see eq . ( [ phi ] ) ) that the $ -game behaves in a way which is similar to the majority game .",
    "[ fsigma1 ] supports this conclusion by comparing , for the different models , the behavior of @xmath78 given by @xmath79    if you consider that @xmath43 persist to be positive for some period .",
    "all those strategies @xmath80 that is playing with @xmath81 will be reinforce due to the payoff @xmath82 .",
    "conversely , all those strategies with @xmath83 will be weakened .",
    "the collective tendency of the traders is to reach a regime where they play with the same strategy .",
    "it is very similar to what happens for mj - model ( for more details discussion of this models , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the $ -players persist to be in a majority group keeping the same strategy for long .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fq1 ] , exhibits these results clearly by reporting the self - overlap @xmath84 given by : @xmath85 this is a measure of the average fluctuation in the strategy choice .",
    "the strategies are labelled by @xmath86 , thus when @xmath87 it means that the players are frozen , i.e they always use the same strategy .",
    "this is what we observe in the mj - model .",
    "[ fq1 ] shows that this happens also in $ -game - model showing that it is modelling a similar market mechanism . on the contrary in the minority game we observe",
    "@xmath88 which means that the players are changing the strategies frequently . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the returns in the minority game are not predictable .",
    "this is measured by the quantity @xmath89 called predictability which is computed as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the probability that @xmath92 . in fig",
    "[ fh1 ] we observe that the predictability @xmath89 is zero when @xmath84 starts to decrease .",
    "it is known that for the minority game the existence of a phase transition for @xmath93 and the region where @xmath94 is called symmetric phase @xcite .",
    "observe that @xmath94 implies @xmath95 for all @xmath96 . in this regime",
    "is not possible to predict the minority group based on the public information @xmath55 , this property is known by economist as _ no arbitrage_. for the other models ( mj and $ -game ) @xmath97 for all value of @xmath72 , that results from the fact that @xmath98 for some value of @xmath96 .",
    "of course , when the strategy of the agents are frozen the game become predictable .    in fig .",
    "[ fs1 ] , we examine the entropy for all these models given by @xmath99 note that @xmath100 was normalized to be in the interval @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "this quantity help us to analyze the dynamics of information @xmath55 in the de - bruijn graph .",
    "the mg dynamics visits all nodes in the graph more or less uniformly .",
    "hence @xmath102 and @xmath100 is closed to one . in both the majority game and the $ -game",
    "we find that @xmath100 is smaller , this means that only few vertices are visited .",
    "the $ -game and mj have a dynamics restricted to some subgraph , i.e. , only a subset of vertices @xmath103 are visited in the stationary regime , resulting in a small value of the entropy @xmath100 .",
    "let us consider now the models whose dynamics takes place over two time steps .",
    "any particular agent first decides which action to take ( buy / sell ) at time @xmath1  according to his / her currently best strategy @xmath104  then takes the opposite action at time @xmath2 and finally evaluates the results according to eq .",
    "( [ dg ] ) , ( [ menor ] ) or ( [ maior ] ) depending on whether he / she behaves according to the $ , minority or majority game respectively .",
    "if all agents behave synchronously , we just have that @xmath105 and it is clear that the $ -game payoffs become exactly identical to mg payoffs .",
    "therefore the $ -game becomes identical with the mg .",
    "the non - trivial case is when agents act non - synchronously .",
    "this means that we can classify agents into two groups , one of which takes decisions on even times and evaluates the outcome on odd times and the other which does the opposite .",
    "our previous argument suggests that when one group is much larger than the other , then @xmath106 and the game s behavior becomes that of the mg .",
    "for this reason , we consider extreme case of equally sized groups .",
    "more precisely , we divide the set of agents into two sets @xmath107 and @xmath108 of @xmath109 agents is even .",
    "concerning eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) when @xmath59 we set @xmath110 or @xmath111 at random , with equal probability . ] , and postulate that , at time @xmath1 , group @xmath112 takes a fresh decision whereas the group @xmath113 reacts , i.e. takes an action which is just the opposite of the one they undertook in the previous time step .",
    "the interaction takes place again through the total excess demand @xmath43 which has now two contributions from the two groups : @xmath114 where we introduced a different notation for the contribution ( @xmath115 ) of the acting group and for that ( @xmath116 ) of the reacting one .",
    "we will first considering how agents using the different scoring rules ( [ dg ] , [ menor ] ) and ( [ maior ] ) behave when they interact among themselves",
    ". then we shall study the behavior of $ -players when they are put in interaction with minority or majority players in a mixed population .",
    "we analyze the situation where each agent in each of the two different groups of traders is endowed with a set of @xmath75 strategies which are randomly drawn at the beginning .",
    "the numerical analysis reveals that _",
    "i ) _ the behavior of a pure population of either minority or majority players is equivalent to that observed for a single times models _ ii ) _ the behavior of the $ -game is similar to that of the mg .",
    "for example , the volatility @xmath117 shows ( see fig .",
    "[ fsigma2 ] ) the typical minimum for the mg whereas it steadily increases as @xmath72 decreases in the case of majority players . in fig  [ fq2 ]",
    "we see that most players get frozen ( @xmath118 ) for mj while the choice of the strategies remains fickle ( @xmath119 ) for minority players , in agreement with the behavior of the corresponding single time models . in the case of $ -players ,",
    "both quantities ( @xmath120 and @xmath84 ) show a behavior similar to that of the mg . the same is true for the entropy @xmath100 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fs2 ] .",
    "indeed , for all models analyzed here , the autocorrelation of @xmath43 is negative , as shown in fig  [ fa2 ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the alternating behavior of agents .",
    "in fact the main contribution is due to the term @xmath121 ( notice that @xmath77 has the same behavior as @xmath122 ) .",
    "the only difference between $ -game and mg appears in the behavior of @xmath89 .",
    "[ fh2 ] shows that @xmath89 vanishes when @xmath123 in a population of minority players ( because @xmath124 ) whereas @xmath89 increases for majority players ( and @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is in line with the behavior of single time models .",
    "the behavior of @xmath89 for the $ -game closely matches that of the mg for @xmath126 but it diverges from it when @xmath123 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that while @xmath127 , ( with @xmath128 ) in the mg , we find that @xmath129 and @xmath130 are uncorrelated in the $ -game .",
    "it is remarkable that when the process @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) is replaced by random draw , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictability @xmath89 of the two models coincides .",
    "this is because then @xmath131 for all @xmath96 when @xmath72 is small .      in order to test further the behavior of $ -game players ,",
    "let us consider how they interact with minority or majority players in a mixed population .",
    "specifically we split each of the two groups @xmath132 in two equal sizes ( now @xmath50 is a multiple of @xmath133 ) . here",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath135 label the type of players in the sub - group .",
    "so for example @xmath136 denotes the case where a population of $ -players interacts with a population of minority players .",
    "again the interaction is on two times , but now we have two contributions to @xmath137 and @xmath138 from the two sub - populations .",
    "we have studied interaction of $ -players with minority or majority players ( i.e. @xmath139 and @xmath140 or @xmath45 ) .",
    "the mixed minority - majority model was studied by de martino , et.al @xcite .",
    "we found that the autocorrelation is always negative in both cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fa3 ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath140 , we find again that the autocorrelation is proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "however contrary to the single population case , we find that when @xmath72 decreases the volatility @xmath120 decreases ( at least down to @xmath141 , see of fig .",
    "[ fsigma3 ] ) . on the contrary @xmath120 increases as @xmath72 decreases when $ -players interact with majority players",
    "( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fsigma3 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that collective behavior is dominated by the sub - population of minority or majority players .",
    "this is confirmed by the behavior of @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fh3 ] , even though it appears that the presence of $ -players removes the phase transition ( or shifts it at least to @xmath142 ) .",
    "this is more clearly evident in the behavior of @xmath84 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fq3 ] . when interacting with majority type players , $ -players also get frozen ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "but also the presence of $ -players makes minority players much less fickle ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "hence $ -players increase the efficiency of coordination of the minority players .    in order to compare the performance of agents of different types , we give the same set of strategies to the two sub - groups @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "in particular we define the overlap @xmath144 between types @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "when @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) the two types of agents behave exactly in the same ( opposite ) way , whereas @xmath147 implies that agents of the two types behave in an uncorrelated way . fig .",
    "[ fq3 ] shows that $ -players behave in a way which is more or less uncorrelated with majority players . on the contrary they display an anti - imitative behavior when interacting with minority players .",
    "it seems indeed reasonable that when minority game type of interaction prevails , as shown by the fact that the autocorrelation of @xmath43 is negative ( see fig . [ fa3 ] ) , two agents with the same strategies would benefit from playing in different ways .",
    "therefore we conclude that on one hand the collective behavior of a mixed population `` imitates '' the behavior of the population with which the $ -player sub - population is interacting with .",
    "but at the microscopic level , the behavior of $ -players tend to be loosely or negatively correlated with that of players of the other type .",
    "the $ -game model reproduces the main statistical features observed for majority game whenever we consider a single times transaction .",
    "the $ -traders freeze on the best strategy since the payoff reinforces an imitative behavior as seen from the positive autocorrelation of the excess of demand @xmath43 .",
    "when we take into account the inter - temporal nature of the transaction , we force all traders to react after all the transactions . to do so , we proposed a model where two populations interact over two time steps , taking decisions at different moments , out of phase . for two interacting homogeneous populations we saw that , when traders are all of minority or majority type , the same behavior as in single time models obtains .",
