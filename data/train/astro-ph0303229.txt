    "systems of globular clusters ( gcs ) can be found in galaxies of virtually all types , from the brightest members of rich galaxy clusters to faint dwarfs in loose groups .",
    "recent studies suggest that , over a range of roughly ten thousand in total luminosity , about 0.25% of the baryonic mass in galaxies takes the form of gcs ( blakeslee , tonry & metzger 1997 ; mclaughlin 1999a ; blakeslee 1999 ) .",
    "given this ubiquity , and the relative ease with which they can be detected and studied in external galaxies , gcs have long been recognized as invaluable probes of galaxy formation and evolution ( see , @xmath8 harris 1991 and references therein ) . to date , observational studies of extragalactic gc systems have most commonly relied on gc specific frequencies , metallicities and , in a few cases , ages , to constrain formation models for gc systems and their host galaxies ( @xmath9 , cohen , blakeslee & rhyzov 1998 ; kundu 1999 ; puzia 1999 ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; larsen 2001 ; jordn 2002 ; cohen , blakeslee & ct 2003 ) .",
    "however , additional insights into the process of galaxy formation may , at least in principle , be gleaned from the dynamical properties of gc systems .",
    "not only do radial velocity surveys of extragalactic gcs provide a way of tracing out the distribution of dark matter within the host galaxy but , with sufficiently large samples , they offer the hope of measuring directly the shape of the gc velocity ellipsoid .",
    "not surprisingly , the first dynamical studies of an extragalactic gc system focused on the rich gc population of m87=ngc 4486 ( @xmath8 huchra & brodie 1987 ; mould , oke & nemec 1987 ;",
    "mould 1990 ) .",
    "however , with radial velocities available for just 44 clusters , only very weak constraints could be placed on the mass distribution  and then only if some assumption ( _ i.e. _ , isotropy ) were made _ a priori _ regarding the gc orbital properties ( see merritt & tremblay 1993 ) . as merritt & tremblay",
    "show , dauntingly large samples of order one thousand velocities would be required to constrain , simultaneously and self - consistently in the absence of any other information , both the velocity anisotropy of a gc system and the underlying mass distribution of its parent galaxy .",
    "only recently have multi - object spectrographs on 4m- and 8m - class telescopes begun to produce anywhere near the large numbers of radial velocities needed to execute such a program in any galaxy .",
    "hanes ( 2001 ) compiled a radial velocity database of 278 gcs associated with m87 after combining new cfht velocities with published data from mould ( 1990 ) , cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) and cohen ( 2000 ) . by using an _ independent _ mass model for m87 and the surrounding `` virgo a '' cluster ( mclaughlin 1999b ) , ct ( 2001 ) showed from these data that the m87 gc system as a whole has an almost perfectly isotropic velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "considered separately , the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subsystems showed some evidence for weak tangential and radial biases , respectively .",
    "since m87 contains the richest and most thoroughly studied gc system in the local supercluster , it was the obvious first choice for such studies . however , its unique location  at the dynamical center of the virgo cluster as traced by both galaxies and intracluster gas  complicates the interpretation of the dynamical properties of its gc system .",
    "for instance , ct ( 2001 ) noted that the apparent rotation of the metal - poor gcs in m87 might be better described as a velocity `` shear '' similar to that exhibited on larger scales by the surrounding virgo cluster _",
    "galaxies_. if correct , this would suggest a connection between the m87 gcs and the surrounding population of ( mostly dwarf ) galaxies , perhaps due to the slow infall of the material onto m87 itself .",
    "if we are to understand which properties of the m87 gc system are generic to early - type galaxies , and which are unique to m87 as a result of its central location in virgo , then we require dynamical studies of additional gc systems .",
    "an appealing second target is that of m49 (= ngc  4472 ) .",
    "as the brightest member of the virgo cluster , m49 contains @xmath7 6000 gcs projected within 100 kpc of its center ( lee 1998 ; mclaughlin 1999a ; rhode & zepf 2001 )  just the number expected for an elliptical galaxy with the luminosity of m49 and a `` normal '' specific frequency .",
    "m87 , by contrast , has an integrated luminosity about 80% that of m49 but contains some 13,500 gcs projected within 100 kpc of its center .",
    "this factor - of - three difference in gc specific frequency between the two galaxies may indicate that some as yet unidentified  second parameter \" has played a role in the formation and/or evolution of their gc systems ( which otherwise appear remarkably similar ; see ct 2003 ) .",
    "however , the relevance of the observed specific frequency difference recently has been called into question by mclaughlin ( 1999a ) , who showed that the number of gcs associated with m87 and m49 are both consistent with a `` universal '' ratio of total gc mass to total baryonic galaxy mass , @xmath10 , once the contribution of x - ray gas mass in each galaxy is included .",
    "the principal distinction between the two may then be the fact that m87 sits at the gas - rich center of the main virgo cluster , while m49 occupies the core of the relatively gas - poor , `` virgo b '' subcluster ( binggeli , tammann & sandage 1987 ; binggeli , popescu & tammann 1993 ; schindler , binggeli & bhringer 1999 ) .",
    "the first radial velocity measurements for m49 gcs were presented by mould ( 1990 ) , who reported a global velocity dispersion of @xmath11 based on a sample of 26 gcs .",
    "building on this work , sharples ( 1998 ) presented radial velocities for an additional 47 gcs , found a difference in velocity dispersion between the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems ( 320 and 240 , respectively ) , and noted the presence of apparent rotation among the metal - poor subsystem .",
    "these conclusions were reinforced by zepf ( 2000 ) , who measured velocities for another 87 gcs and found global velocity dispersions of 356@xmath1225  and 221@xmath1222  for the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems , with projected rotation amplitudes of 101 and 15  for the two populations .",
    "these findings are in stark contrast with those for m87 , where both gc populations were found to be rapidly rotating , with projected rotation amplitudes of roughly 170 ( ct 2001 ) .",
    "zepf also calculated the mass distribution around m49 implied by the velocity - dispersion profile of the full gc system under the _ assumption _ of orbital isotropy , and showed this to resemble the gravitating - mass profile inferred from x - ray observations ( irwin & sarazin 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present 196 new radial velocities for gc candidates in m49 obtained with the keck i and ii telescopes . combining our new radial velocities with those from the literature , we isolate a sample of 263 distinct objects whose colors and radial velocities are consistent with their being gcs belonging to m49 .",
    "this database is comparable to that presented recently for m87 ( hanes 2001 ) in terms of sample size , spatial coverage ( from about 0.1 to 3 effective radii ) , velocity precision , and the availability of metallicities from washington photometry . with it ,",
    "we largely confirm the earlier conclusions summarized above on the global , spatially averaged kinematics of the gc system as a whole and of its metal - poor and metal - rich components .",
    "however , with our expanded dataset , we are better able to examine trends in the gc kinematics as a function of galactocentric position .",
    "we see some evidence that the bulk of the metal - rich gc system may in fact rotate  albeit very slowly and with low statistical significance  in a direction opposite to the metal - poor gcs .",
    "we then go on to carry out a dynamical analysis of the three gc samples ( full , metal - poor , and metal - rich ) based on the jeans equation following the methodology laid out in mclaughlin ( 1999b ) and ct ( 2001 ) .",
    "we adopt a mass model for m49/virgo b that we have constructed completely independently of any gc data ( mclaughlin & ct 2003 ) , which allows us to treat the velocity anisotropy of the gc system as a free parameter to be constrained .",
    "our main new result is the demonstration that velocity isotropy suffices fully to describe the velocity ellipsoid of the full globular cluster system ( @xmath13 , with no attempt made to separate red gcs from blue ) .",
    "m49 is the second galaxy ( after m87 ) in which we have attempted this sort of analysis , and it is the second in which isotropy has been found to hold to a high level of precision .",
    "quite apart from any bearing that gc dynamics will have on issues of galaxy and globular cluster formation , this suggests that it could very well be reasonable to _ assume _ orbital isotropy in other gc systems in order to use them as accurate probes of the total mass distribution in early - type galaxies whose mass profiles have not been secured through independent means .",
    "in this section , we describe the criteria used to target candidate gcs for observation with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke 1995 ) , the procedures used to acquire and reduce the lris spectra , and the methods used to define the composite gc database for m49 .      before embarking upon a radial velocity survey",
    ", we require a sample of objects whose magnitudes and colors are consistent with those expected for gcs associated with the program galaxy .",
    "we used the photometric catalog of geisler , lee & kim ( 1996 ) to select candidate gcs for spectroscopic observations .",
    "this catalog , which contains gc candidates spread over an area of @xmath7 256 arcmin@xmath14 centered on m49 , has the benefit that the imaging on which it is based was carried out in washington @xmath15 and @xmath16 filters , a combination that is known to provide excellent metallicity sensitivity for old stellar populations .",
    "a total of 1774 gc candidates brighter than @xmath17 make up the catalog . since accurate coordinates are needed to design the slit - masks , we combined the gc pixel positions given in geisler ( 1996 ) with the coordinates reported by sharples ( 1998 ) for 61 gcs to derive astrometric positions for all objects in the geisler ( 1996 ) catalog .",
    "spectra for candidate gcs were obtained in the course of four observing runs at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory during the 1998 , 1999 and 2000 observing seasons .",
    "the observing log given in table  [ tab1 ] records the identification number , observing dates , grating , central wavelength and resolving power for each observing run .",
    "a total of 14 lris masks were designed , targeting gc candidates in the range @xmath18 and 20 @xmath19 22.25 .",
    "individual masks contained between 19 and 29 slits , measuring 10 in width and having a minimum length of 80 .",
    "two different instrumental setups were employed . during runs 1 and 4",
    ", we used a 600  line  mm@xmath1 grating blazed at 5000   and centered at wavelengths of 5200   and 4860  , respectively . during",
    "runs 2 and 3 , we used a 600 line mm@xmath1 grating blazed at 7500   and centered at 8550  .",
    "for both configurations , the dispersion was 1.28 pixel@xmath1 , giving a spectral resolution of 6    and a wavelength coverage of @xmath72600  .",
    "for each mask , we obtained a pair of exposures ranging between 2400s and 3000s , with comparison spectra for hg - ne - ar - kr - xe and quartz lamps taken before and/or after each exposure . on each night , long - slit spectra for 24 iau radial velocity standard stars were obtained during twilight .",
    "the extracted , wavelength - calibrated spectra for the candidate gcs were cross - correlated against a master template spectrum created from these spectra .",
    "all reductions were performed within the iraf environment .",
    "uncertainties for radial velocities measured from spectra acquired during runs 13 were derived from the cross - correlation functions using the method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "a total of 147 radial velocities were measured during these observing runs ; the mean and median uncertainties for these measurements are 104 and 97 km s@xmath1 .",
    "spectra obtained during run 4 were typically of the highest quality , as only the brightest gc candidates were selected during this run ( @xmath20 objects with 20.1 @xmath19 21.51 ) .",
    "radial velocities were measured from these spectra following the methods outlined in cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , and representative uncertainties of 25 or 50 km  s@xmath1 were assigned based on the repeatability of measurements based on multiple strong absorption lines . including these measurements ,",
    "the total number of new radial velocities presented here is 196 , with mean and median uncertainties of 86 and 79 km s@xmath1 , respectively .      before examining the gc kinematics or carrying out a dynamical analysis",
    ", we must combine the new velocities with published measurements to isolate a sample of bona fide gcs . in order to correct for possible systematic differences between radial velocities measured during different runs , and with different instruments or telescopes , we have transformed the raw velocities from april 1998 and april 1999 ( runs 1 and 3 , respectively ) onto the system defined by our april 2000 observations ( run 4 ) via the relations , @xmath21 which were derived from gcs whose velocities were measured during run 4 , and either of runs 1 and 3 .",
    "since there are no objects in common between runs 2 and 4 , no correction was applied to the former dataset .",
    "likewise , no corrections were applied to the velocities of sharples ( 1998 ) and zepf ( 2000 ) , since both datasets show good agreement with our measurements .",
    "however , we found it necessary to apply a transformation to the velocities of mould ( 1990 ) : @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the corrected and uncorrected velocities from mould ( 1990 ) .",
    "both the scale and zero - point terms in this relation agree with those found by hanes ( 2001 ) from a comparison of mould ( 1990 ) radial velocities for m87 gcs with those measured at keck and cfht .",
    "figure  [ fig01 ] compares velocities measured during run 4 with previously published velocities and those obtained during other keck runs , after applying the above transformations .",
    "the dashed line shows the one - to - one relation , while the dotted line indicates the line of best fit .    after transforming the radial velocities onto a common system , the various datasets were merged and a weighted mean velocity , @xmath25 , was calculated from all measurements for each object .",
    "unfortunately , given the galaxy s low systemic velocity ( @xmath26  according to the nasa extragalactic database ) and the large line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the gc system ( @xmath27 ; see  3 below ) , there is some ambiguity in distinguishing low - velocity gcs from foreground galactic stars . after some experimentation",
    ", we decided to discard those objects with radial velocities outside of the interval , @xmath28 where the upper limit was chosen to include a few unambiguous gcs with radial velocities of @xmath29 .",
    "requiring this range to be symmetric about the systemic velocity would give a low - end cutoff of @xmath7 50 .",
    "such a cutoff would almost certainly result in the inclusion of some halo stars in our sample . if the velocity dispersion of the m49 gc system is @xmath7 300  then , in a sample of the present size , we expect at most two m49 globulars will fall below the low - end velocity limit in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the above selection on radial velocity , we imposed the condition that true m49 gcs must have colors in the range , @xmath30 and adopted a foreground extinction of @xmath31 based on the dirbe maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davies ( 1998 ) . according to the relation of secker ( 1995 ) ,",
    "this extinction is equivalent to @xmath32 = 0.045 . with the color - metallicity calibration of geisler & forte ( 1990 )",
    ", this color range translates to a metallicity interval of @xmath332.15  @xmath34  [ fe / h ]  @xmath34  + 0.8  dex . from optical spectroscopy ,",
    "beasley ( 2000 ) showed the m49 gc system to span a range of @xmath331.6 @xmath34 [ fe / h ] @xmath34 0  dex , so our selection limits should include the vast majority of gcs in m49 .",
    "figure [ fig02 ] presents an illustration of these selection criteria .",
    "the upper left panel shows color histograms for the 1774 objects with @xmath35 in the the catalog of geisler ( 1996 ) , as well as for the 276 gc candidates with measured velocities ( upper and lower histograms , respectively ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines show the adopted cutoffs on @xmath36 color , while the dotted vertical lines indicates the value of @xmath37 used to divide the sample into metal - poor and metal - rich components .",
    "according to the color - metallicity relation of geisler & forte ( 1990 ) , this dividing point corresponds to a metallicity of [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath330.68  dex .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  [ fig02 ] shows a radial velocity histogram for the same sample of 276 objects .",
    "note that two objects ( identification numbers # 4497 and # 1982 in geisler 1996 ) fall outside the plotted region .",
    "the vertical lines show the adopted cutoffs on radial velocity , while the arrow indicates the velocity of m49 itself .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig02 ] shows the joint constraints on color and radial velocity in the form of a color - velocity diagram .",
    "filled circles show all objects with measured radial velocities , with the exception of # 4497 and # 1982 which , once again , fall outside the plotted region .",
    "the dashed box indicates the adopted selection criteria for color and radial velocity .",
    "note that # 2256 , the lone circled object inside the boxed region , was not included in the final sample of gcs since two independent velocity measurements for this object differ by more than 700 km s@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , two independent measurements for # 1982 disagree on whether this object is a true gc or a background galaxy . discarding it , and the 12 objects that fall outside of the dashed region in figure  [ fig02 ]",
    ", brings the final sample to 263 gcs .",
    "the final gc database is given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the first five columns of this table record the object identification number from geisler ( 1996 ) , right ascension , declination , distance from the center of m49 in arcseconds , @xmath38 , and position angle , @xmath39 , in degrees east of north . in calculating @xmath38 and @xmath39",

    "the large circle shows our determination of galaxy s effective radius , @xmath45 , based on our modeling of the kim surface photometry ( see  4.2 below ) . at our adopted distance of 15  mpc , 1= 4.363 kpc , so that @xmath46 kpc .",
    "the full gc sample spans a range of projected galactocentric radius @xmath47 , equivalent to @xmath48 kpc or @xmath49 0.13@xmath50 .",
    "a comparison of figure  [ fig03 ] with figure  2 of ct ( 2001 ) reveals the azimuthal distribution of radial velocity measurements to be somewhat more uniform in m49 than was the case for m87 .",
    "before proceeding with a dynamical analysis of the gc system , we examine its kinematics in a model - independent way . our aim is to determine the basic parameters that describe the gc system : the average line - of - sight velocity , projected velocity dispersion and , if rotation is important , its amplitude and the position angle of the rotation axis . in this section ,",
    "we consider both the global kinematic properties of the gc system and their behavior as a function of galactocentric distance .",
    "we fit the observed line - of - sight velocities of the gcs with the function , @xmath51 where @xmath39 is the projected position angle from a reference axis ( taken here to be the north  south direction , such that @xmath39 is measured in degrees east of north ) and @xmath52 is the orientation of the rotation axis of the gc system . a complete discussion of the implications of fitting sine curves of this type to projected ( @xmath53 , @xmath39 ) data is given in ct ( 2001 ) .",
    "briefly , in so doing we assume that the gc system is spherically symmetric with an intrinsic angular velocity field stratified on spheres , and that the gc rotation axis lies exactly in the plane of the sky ( in other words , that the galaxy is being viewed `` edge - on '' ) . in principle",
    ", the rotation amplitude , @xmath54 , may then be any function of galactocentric radius @xmath38 ; fitting equation ( [ eq5 ] ) to our data does not imply an assumption of solid - body rotation or of cylindrical symmetry in the velocity field .",
    "our assumption of spherical symmetry for the gc system is reasonable given its modest projected ellipticity ( 0.16 according to lee 1998 ) .",
    "kinematic properties of various subsets of the gc system are summarized in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the first five columns in this table record the radial range spanned by the cluster sample in question , the median galactocentric distance , @xmath55 , and number , @xmath56 , of gcs in each sample , the average radial velocity ( the biweight `` location '' of beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) , @xmath57 , and the rms dispersion about this average ( the biweight `` scale '' of beers 1990 ) , @xmath58 .",
    "quoted uncertainties represent 68% ( 1-@xmath3 ) confidence intervals , determined from a numerical bootstrap procedure in which 1000 artificial datasets are individually analyzed after choosing @xmath56 clusters at random from the actual subsample under consideration .    rather than let @xmath59 be a free parameter in the fits of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) to the @xmath25@xmath39 data , we make use of the expectation ( confirmed by the results in column 4 of table [ tab3 ] ) that the average velocity of the gc system should equal that of m49 itself : @xmath60 . in the remaining columns of table [ tab3 ] , we therefore give the position angle of the rotation axis , @xmath52 , the rotation amplitude , @xmath61 , and the dispersion about the best - fit sine curve , @xmath62 , obtained with this constraint placed on @xmath59 .",
    "the first line of each the three subsections of table [ tab3 ] presents the results of immediate interest : the global kinematics ( @xmath13 , those determined using all appropriate gc data with no discrimination on the basis of galactocentric position ) for our full gc sample and for the separate metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems .",
    "the remainder of the table applies to further division of the gc data into four wide radial bins ; these results are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the global velocity dispersion of the metal - poor gc system is significantly larger than that of the metal - rich gc system : @xmath63  versus 265 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the global velocity dispersion of the entire gc system , @xmath64 , is naturally intermediate to these values ; it falls somewhat closer to the metal - poor value because that sample is @xmath7 50% larger than the metal - rich one .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous measurements of sharples ( 1998 ) and zepf ( 2000 ) based on smaller samples .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] plots the individual velocities @xmath65 against projected position angle @xmath39 for gcs at all galactocentric radii in each of our three metallicity samples . a horizontal , broken line in each panel of this figure marks the velocity of m49 , @xmath66 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the lower dispersion of the metal - rich gc velocities relative to the metal - poor sample stems in part from the absence of even a single gc with @xmath67 and @xmath68  a fact that is also reflected in the empty , upper right - hand corner of the box used to identify globular clusters in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig02 ] .",
    "it would appear that this effect is real : if the metal - rich gc velocity dispersion were the same ( @xmath49 340 ) as the metal - poor one , then given a sample of 105 metal - rich clusters with @xmath69 , we should have also found 89 with @xmath70 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "there is no obvious deficiency in the spatial coverage of the full radial velocity survey that might account for the discrepancy ( see figure  [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "the bold sine curves in the two upper panels of figure  [ fig04 ] trace the best fits of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) to the entire gc dataset and the metal - poor subset when @xmath59 is held fixed and equal to @xmath66 ( _ i.e. _ , with @xmath54 and @xmath52 given in columns 6 and 7 of table [ tab3 ] ) . for the full sample",

    "more importantly , we find that @xmath73  and @xmath74 for the metal - poor sample , while @xmath54 is easily consistent with zero for the metal - rich gc system ( hence , the fit to it is not drawn on figure  [ fig04 ] ) .",
    "thus , averaged over @xmath75 in m49 , the metal - rich gc system shows essentially no net rotation , while the metal - poor gc system does .",
    "our result for the metal - poor rotation amplitude is consistent with that of zepf ( 2000 ) , who found @xmath76  for a sample of 93 blue gcs .",
    "our finding for the metal - rich gc is similarly in keeping with previous analyses ( see also sharples 1998 ) .",
    "the position angle of the galaxy s photometric minor axis is @xmath77 ( kim 2000 ) and , to within its ( large ) 1-@xmath3 errorbars , our fitted rotation axis for the metal - poor gc system is roughly consistent with this .",
    "however , it is incompatible at the 1.5-@xmath3 level with alignment along the photometric _ major _ axis , which is the solution favored by zepf ( 2000 ) for their smaller sample of metal - poor gcs ( and their full gc system ) . though also similar to the photometric minor axis of m49 ,",
    "the fitted @xmath52 for the metal - rich gcs is effectively meaningless because of the formally null rotation amplitude .    to summarize these _ global ,",
    "spatially averaged _ impressions , the average velocity of each gc sample is in very good agreement with that of m49 itself .",
    "the global velocity dispersions of the metal - poor and metal - rich samples differ formally by 76  ( although the 2-@xmath3 errorbars overlap ) with the metal - poor gcs being dynamically hotter than their metal - rich counterparts .",
    "the gc system appears as a whole to be slowly rotating , but this is purely the result of a net signal from the metal - poor gc subsystem alone ; the metal - rich subsystem has none .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the full and the metal - poor gc samples are not changed by the correction for rotation , as is apparent from a comparison of the values of @xmath62 and @xmath58 in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "thus , regardless of its statistical significance , rotation is not dynamically important in the m49 gc system .",
    "and although it is only loosely determined , the average kinematic axis of the metal - poor gc system does not differ significantly from the photometric minor axis of m49",
    ".      table [ tab3 ] also presents the gc kinematics that result from further dividing each of the three metallicity samples that we have defined into four broad radial bins : ( 1 ) @xmath78 ; ( 2 ) @xmath79 ; ( 3 ) @xmath80 ; and ( 4 ) @xmath81 .",
    "although the parameters in some bins with small gc numbers must be viewed with caution , the results suggest that there are no drastic changes in the average and rms velocities for each sample .",
    "it is also clear that the lower velocity dispersion of the metal - rich gcs relative to the metal - poor gcs , noted above on the basis of globally averaged kinematics , is only apparent outside of the first radial bin ; the metal - poor and metal - rich clusters within @xmath82 have the same @xmath58 and @xmath62 .",
    "figures [ fig05 ] and [ fig06 ] demonstrate these points visually .",
    "figure [ fig05 ] is a plot of individual gc velocities versus projected galactocentric radii , for the entire sample regardless of color and for the metal - poor and metal - rich subsamples separately .",
    "overplotted are large , open squares at the median radius and average velocity of each radial bin , as reported in columns 2 and 4 of table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the vertical errorbars on these large squares represent the dispersion about the average velocity ( column 5 of table [ tab3 ] ) , and the horizontal errorbars delimit the bins themselves .",
    "the broken horizontal line through each panel shows the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "the scatter of points about the line @xmath83  in the top panel of figure  [ fig05 ] implies that the average and dispersion of @xmath25 in the full gc system are indeed essentially constant as functions of galactocentric position  until the region beyond @xmath84 kpc , where there is an obvious dearth of high - velocity gcs in our sample .",
    "we suspect that this is an artifact of the small sample size , but we can not rule out with certainty that is a real , physical effect . until the question can be addressed directly ( with still more gc velocity measurements at large radii ) , any kinematics referring to @xmath85 in the m49 gc system should perhaps be viewed as provisional . meanwhile , the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ fig05 ] suggest that the average velocities of the metal - poor and metal - rich subsamples agree separately , at all @xmath86 kpc , with the galaxy s systemic velocity .",
    "the bottom panel also shows again the absence of any red gcs with @xmath68 , and it further reveals a deficit of clusters with @xmath87  at radii @xmath88 .",
    "we have also constructed `` smoothed '' , binning - independent radial profiles of average and rms gc velocity , following the procedure of ct ( 2001 ) : a radial bin of fixed width ( chosen here to be @xmath89  kpc ) is slid through the gc dataset , centering on each globular in turn , and if the number of objects falling within this spatial bin exceeds a minimum of 20 then the biweight average and rms velocity at that position are calculated .",
    "( equation [ [ eq5 ] ] is also fit to the @xmath25@xmath39 data in the bin around every point ; the rotation profiles that result are discussed below . )",
    "confidence intervals about the best - fit kinematics are defined by the same bootstrap method that was used to calculate the errorbars in table  [ tab3 ] .    the profile of average gc velocity as a function of galactocentric position that results from this procedure only confirms that @xmath57 is constant ( inside @xmath86 kpc ) and equal to @xmath90 for each metallicity sample .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles that we obtain are shown in figure  [ fig06 ] for the full gc system and the metal - poor and metal - rich subsets ( filled squares represent the dispersion @xmath58 of velocities about the average ; open squares , the dispersion @xmath91 about the best - fit sine curve at each point ) .",
    "the horizontal errorbar in the top panel represents the 2  width of the sliding radial bin that we have used ; only points separated by this distance in these plots are statistically independent .",
    "the dotted and solid lines around the points in each panel denote the 68% and 95% confidence intervals for each measurement .",
    "all in all , the impressions gleaned from table [ tab3 ] and figure  [ fig05 ] are confirmed in figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the full gc system is remarkably constant as a function of radius inside @xmath92 kpc , never straying by more than @xmath93 from the global average of 312  ( dashed horizontal line in the top panel ) .",
    "we do not see the gradual decline in @xmath94 with radius that was inferred by zepf ( 2000 ) on the basis of a heavily spatially smoothed representation of a smaller dataset .",
    "the dispersion profile of the metal - poor gcs is also relatively flat ; if anything , it tends to increase towards larger radii ( although this trend is not highly significant ) .",
    "this behavior is opposite to that found by zepf ( 2000 ) .",
    "the metal - rich gc system is roughly as dynamically hot as the metal - poor gc sample at small galactocentric radii , but it becomes colder beyond @xmath95 before possibly increasing slightly again towards @xmath96 .",
    "none of this variation , however , is significant at more than the 68% confidence level .",
    "also , note that we are unable to trace the metal - rich gc kinematics beyond @xmath97 in the present approach , because there are fewer than 20 red clusters between that radius and @xmath98 , whereas every point in figure  [ fig06 ] relies on data for at least 20 gcs within a 2  interval in @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we have included in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig06 ] ( as a large open square with vertical errorbars corresponding to 68% and 95% confidence intervals ) the estimate for @xmath58 in the outermost radial bin of table [ tab3 ] .",
    "zepf ( 2000 ) presented a smoothed velocity dispersion profile for the metal - rich gc system that appears somewhat flatter than ours inside @xmath99 .",
    "the `` rotation - corrected ''",
    "gc velocity dispersions , @xmath91 , are nowhere , in any of the three metallicity samples , dramatically different from the dispersions , @xmath58 , about the average velocity .",
    "this is yet another demonstration that rotation is dynamically unimportant in the globular cluster system of this galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , it is of some interest to consider the rotation properties of the gcs as a function of galactocentric radius , as they appear to be somewhat more subtle than suggested by the global view of  3.1 , in which the metal - poor gcs show a statistically significant , if small , net rotation while the metal - rich ones do not .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig07 ] plots of gc velocity versus projected position angle , for each of the four radial bins defined in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "a broken , horizontal line in each panel again indicates the overall velocity of m49 , @xmath66 , and the bold sine curves trace the best fits of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) to the metal - poor ( filled points and solid curves ) and metal - rich ( open points and broken curves ) gcs in each bin .",
    "( the fit parameters are again those in columns 6 and 7 of table [ tab3 ] . )",
    "this gives some indication of the quality of the sine fits we are able to achieve with the data so finely divided , and the extent to which such fits are even feasible given the data .",
    "note that we do not present any rotation fit for the metal - rich gcs in the bin @xmath100 , for reasons that we shall discuss shortly .    for more detail , figures  [ fig08][fig10 ] plot the runs of @xmath54 and @xmath52 with galactocentric radius in the full gc system and in the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems , obtained during the same `` smoothing '' process that resulted in the velocity dispersion profiles in figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "figure [ fig08 ] , which presents the results for our full sample of 263 gcs , is included primarily for completeness , as it is somewhat more profitable to consider the metal - poor and metal - rich subsamples separately .",
    "worthy of note here , however , are the large uncertainties at every radius in the @xmath52 and @xmath54 determinations ( as in figure  [ fig06 ] , 68% and 95% confidence intervals are indicated here ) , even when our full dataset is analyzed in bins as wide as 2",
    ". much larger numbers of gc velocities will be required if the rotation properties of the system are to be characterized point - by - point in this way with any real confidence .",
    "figure [ fig09 ] shows the rotation axis and amplitude as functions of @xmath38 in the metal - poor gc system only . inside @xmath101  kpc , @xmath52 is essentially constant and generally within @xmath93 of the photometric minor axis of m49 ( drawn as the bold , solid lines in the top panel of figure  [ fig09 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is made clear in this plot that the rotation axis of the metal - poor gc system by and large falls closer to the galaxy s minor axis than its major axis .",
    "the @xmath54 profile is similarly rather flat , holding roughly steady ( again , within the 1-@xmath3 uncertainties ) at the level of 100150 .",
    "it is nonzero almost everywhere at better than the 68% confidence level , but less than the 2-@xmath3 level .",
    "the obvious exception is at very small radii , @xmath102 .",
    "the strong negative rotation suggested in the innermost radial bin of table [ tab3 ] , and illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig07 ] , is seen here simply not to be significant ; it is an artifact of the small sample size .",
    "it could be of considerable interest that the metal - poor rotation axis appears to switch suddenly to align with the photometric _ major _ axis of m49 ( indicated by the bold , dashed lines in the top panel of figure  [ fig09 ] ) at the largest radii probed by our sample , @xmath103 .",
    "this is clearly responsible for a similar , though slightly more muted , trend in the full gc system ( figure  [ fig08 ] ) .",
    "however , since every point plotted in these graphs incorporates all gc data from within 1  on either side of it , the measurements beyond 6  all rely on some velocities from @xmath104 kpc , which is the regime that was mentioned as somewhat suspect on the basis of figure  [ fig05 ] . a larger dataset",
    "is required to confirm this potential major - axis rotation at large radii in the metal - poor gc system .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] presents the analysis as applied to the metal - rich gc system .",
    "since the `` smoothed '' profiles can not be calculated beyond @xmath103 in this case , a single large data point is used to represent the sine - fit parameters for all metal - rich gcs with @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) together . at small radii @xmath107 , the axis of gc rotation is poorly determined but is consistent , within the 95% confidence bands , with alignment everywhere along the photometric minor axis ( or coincidence with the formal best fit , @xmath108 , to the metal - poor gc rotation ) .",
    "notably , and despite the vanishing net rotation of the globally averaged metal - rich gc sample , @xmath54 at these small radii differs from zero at the @xmath7 1-@xmath3 level and is of _ opposite sign _ to that found for the metal - poor gcs .",
    "thus , there is marginal evidence for some counter - rotation in the metal - rich gc subsystem , relative to the metal - poor one , inside @xmath109 in m49 .",
    "the situation appears in figure  [ fig10 ] to change suddenly around @xmath110 , with @xmath54 becoming positive , large , and significant at the @xmath111 confidence level .",
    "the rotation axis also appears to come sharply into line with the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "however , the reversion to a negative rotation of much lower significance in the outermost bin of our sample suggests that this effect may be related to some curiosity in the data between @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , inspection of the metal - rich gc distribution in the third panel of figure  [ fig07 ] shows immediately that the azimuthal sampling of metal - rich gc velocities in this radial range is highly incomplete : all but a few data points lie within a couple tens of degrees of the photometric major axis on opposite sides of the galaxy ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "the strong `` prograde '' rotation that suddenly appears in figure  [ fig10 ] comes entirely from a small group of 10 metal - rich clusters , all contained in the thin annulus @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and located at opposite poles of the photometric major axis . in ( @xmath25 , @xmath39 ) space ,",
    "these gcs trace almost perfectly ( with a dispersion of only @xmath7100 ) a sine curve with peak and trough at the position angles of the major axis and an amplitude @xmath117 . because all 10 objects are so closely spaced around their median radius of @xmath118 , all 10 are included in every point with @xmath119 in figure  [ fig10 ] , and they are thus entirely responsible for the behavior in those portions of the smoothed @xmath52 and @xmath54 profiles ( recall that every point in these profiles is computed using all gc velocities within @xmath120 of the indicated position ) .",
    "similarly , the same 10 objects single - handedly erase a ( weak ) net negative - rotation signal from the rest of the metal - rich gc system .    in the top panel of figure [ fig11 ]",
    ", we show the velocity - position curve of the gcs in question .",
    "the sine fit indicated has @xmath121  and @xmath122 fixed , and a fitted amplitude of @xmath123  ( 2-@xmath3 lower limit : 145 ) .",
    "the i d s of the ten objects from table [ tab2 ] are : 677 , 830 , 929 , 1508 , 6905 , 7043 , 7894 , 8164 , 8740 , and 8890 . aside from their galactocentric radius , there is no obvious , common characteristic to distinguish them from any other data , although we do note that five of the 10 clusters have super - solar metallicities , and that the one [ # 6905 ] falling farthest from the fitted sine curve is also the most metal - poor .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig11 ] is an attempt to delineate the rotation curve of the metal - rich gc system with the clusters at @xmath124 isolated from the rest of the sample . on the basis of the smoothed profiles at @xmath125 and the single - bin datapoints at @xmath126 in figure  [ fig10 ]",
    ", we fix the position angle of the rotation axis to coincide with the galaxy minor axis for definiteness here ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the same smoothing procedure is applied as before , to fit for @xmath54 in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , but only using gc data interior to @xmath128 .",
    "the result , shown as the small , solid squares between @xmath129 in figure  [ fig11 ] ( but incorporating data from @xmath130 ) , can hardly be called a profile any longer , as now only the two endpoints are independent .",
    "it does , however , give an impression of the ( small ) impact that a particular choice of bin boundaries has on the derived gc rotation amplitude .",
    "the open square at @xmath131 kpc represents the clusters in the top panel of figure  [ fig11 ] , while the open square at @xmath132 is at the rotation amplitude fit to the gcs with @xmath105 with @xmath121  and @xmath122 both held fixed .    as we suggested just above",
    ", the removal of the small group of apparently rapidly rotating clusters around @xmath13324.5 kpc leaves a metal - rich gc system that , beyond @xmath134 appears to be rotating  albeit slowly , and with less than impressive statistical significance  roughly around the minor axis in a direction counter to the metal - poor gc system . whether this feature is real or not",
    " and , indeed , whether the highly contaminating influence of the 10 isolated gcs is an unlucky byproduct of sampling statistics or an indication of a real , physical grouping of newly recognized objects  can only be decided by the acquisition of further velocity data .",
    "additional observations of these clusters would certainly be useful , as they may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event . in any case , it is clear that globally averaged kinematics are bound to miss potentially significant and complex radial variations within a gc system .",
    "any arguments about gc and galaxy formation and evolution that draw only on globally averaged rotation should be regarded in this light .",
    "we have checked that excluding the aberrant metal - rich gcs does not lead to significant changes ( no more than a few  for velocities , or degrees in @xmath52 ) in the derived kinematics of the full gc velocity sample , either in table [ tab3 ] or figure  [ fig08 ] .",
    "it does , of course , alter the global rotation of the metal - rich gc sample from that quoted in table [ fig03 ] , and the revised numbers are given in table [ tab4 ] below (  5 ) .",
    "their exclusion also leaves too few gcs in the bin @xmath135 to derive a reliable rotation solution there , which is why none is given in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "however , the spatial sampling of points around an annulus at a given radius should not affect grossly the estimation of a velocity dispersion there , and thus the metal - rich @xmath94 profile in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig06 ] ( which excludes no data ) is likely still reasonable enough  although the points between @xmath136 should obviously be regarded with due caution .    finally",
    ", we plot in figure  [ fig12 ] the absolute value of the ratio of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion as a function of radius in the full gc system , the metal - poor subsystem , and the metal - rich sample .",
    "note that the latter profile corresponds to the rotation solutions as obtained in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig11 ] , rather than figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "for the metal - poor subsystem , a constant @xmath1370.4 could be taken as an adequate description , within the 1-@xmath3 uncertainties , of the metal - poor gc data at all radii ( except perhaps around @xmath138 kpc ) .",
    "thus , as the low statistical significance of all the rotation amplitudes has already suggested , rotation is not an important source of dynamical support in the m49 gc system .",
    "the weighted average for the full gc system , from either of tables [ tab3 ] or [ tab4 ] , is @xmath139 0.150.2 .",
    "a similar , though perhaps slightly higher , ratio also applies in the metal - poor gc system . and , with only the exception of the 10 extreme clusters at @xmath140 kpc , the metal - rich gc system is consistent everywhere with @xmath1410.2 . in the next section ,",
    "we therefore explore the dynamics of the m49 gc system through a jeans - equation analysis that ignores altogether the presence of rotation .",
    "nowhere should this expose us to uncertainty or error at any more than a @xmath710% level .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry to proceed with a dynamical analysis based on the jeans equation in the absence of rotation : @xmath142 here @xmath143 is the three dimensional density profile of the gc system ; @xmath144 is its intrinsic velocity dispersion in the radial direction ; @xmath145 is a measure of its velocity anisotropy ; and @xmath146 is the total gravitating mass enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath147 .    our analysis of the m49 gc system parallels that undertaken for m87 by ct ( 2001 ) , and",
    "it differs from the approach normally taken in dynamical studies of extragalactic gc systems ( @xmath8 huchra & brodie 1987 ; mould 1990 ; cohen & ryzhov 1997 ; sharples 1998 ; kissler - patig & gebhardt 1998 ; zepf 2000 ) , in which the measured line - of - sight velocity dispersions are used to infer the deprojected profile @xmath144 so as to solve equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , under the assumption of orbital isotropy [ @xmath148 , for the gravitating mass distribution @xmath146 .",
    "we opt instead to determine a mass model for m49 and the virgo b subcluster _ a priori _ ( and independently of any gc data ) and then to use this model , along with three - dimensional gc density profiles that fit published number counts , to solve equation ( [ eq6 ] ) for the velocity dispersion profile @xmath144 under a variety of assumptions on the velocity anisotropy @xmath149 .",
    "these model profiles are then numerically projected for comparison with the observed @xmath94 profiles obtained in  3.2 , in order to examine more directly what range of @xmath149 is compatible with the data .",
    "( the observed dispersion profiles are still too noisy to be deprojected and used to solve directly for @xmath149 with any confidence . )",
    "romanowsky & kochanek ( 2001 ) present an analysis of the m87 gc system that employs different methodology for the same basic goal .    for later reference ,",
    "the relevant projection integrals are @xmath150 where the surface density profile @xmath151 is related to the three - dimensional @xmath143 by @xmath152    throughout this section , we discuss all distances , densities , masses , and luminosities in physical units that assume a distance of 15 mpc to m49 .",
    "figure [ fig13 ] shows the projected number - density profiles , @xmath151 , for gcs of all colors ( metallicities ) , taken from the comprehensive and independent studies of mclaughlin ( 1999a ) and rhode & zepf ( 2001 ) .",
    "these authors have already corrected the gc densities to remove contamination by foreground stars and background galaxies , and to account for gcs not directly counted because they are fainter than the limiting magnitudes of their surveys ( this latter correction assumes the gc luminosity function , or number of clusters per unit magnitude , to have a gaussian shape with a peak at @xmath153 mag and a dispersion @xmath154 mag ) .",
    "thus , the data points shown here genuinely reflect the total number of gcs per unit area on the sky as a function of projected radius in m49 .    for use in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , we treat both sets of data together as a single number - density profile , to which we fit the projections of two simple three - dimensional density functions .",
    "shown as the bold , solid curve in figure  [ fig13 ] is the best - fit projection of the density profile suggested by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) for dark - matter halos , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath155 : @xmath156 with ( correlated ) uncertainties of @xmath157 in the normalization and @xmath158 kpc in the scale radius    the bold , dashed line in figure  [ fig13 ] shows the best - fit projection of one of the simple family of galaxy models developed by dehnen ( 1993 ) : @xmath159 .",
    "we assume @xmath160 and find @xmath161 with correlated uncertainties of @xmath162 in the normalization and @xmath163 kpc in the scale radius .",
    "the reduced @xmath164 values of these two fits are comparable .",
    "we prefer the navarro ( nfw ) form of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , because the total baryonic mass density ( stars and x - ray gas ) at large radii in m49 appears to fall off roughly as @xmath165 ( mclaughlin & ct 2003 ) , and we expect the gc system to follow this behavior ( mclaughlin 1999a ) .",
    "however , the particular form of the density profile in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) was chosen specifically for its contrasting asymptotic behavior at both small and large galactocentric radii ; with it , we can check directly the extent to which the functional form of @xmath143 used in the jeans equation ( [ eq6 ] ) might influence our conclusions on the gc dynamics .",
    "we wish also to model the dynamics of the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subsystems separately . to define individual density profiles for them , we make use of the catalog of lee ( 1998 ) , which includes positions and washington @xmath36 colors for @xmath7 2000 gc candidates around m49 .",
    "although lee ( 1998 ) themselves presented separate density profiles for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs , the criteria they used to divide their sample by color differ slightly from those adopted here , in  2.3 .",
    "we therefore use their catalog directly to re - derive the surface density profiles of those objects with @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "we count only the points that are also brighter than @xmath35 , to which magnitude the lee catalog is better than 97% complete . because the catalog includes gcs only out to @xmath168 from the center of m49 , whereas the full gc system is known to extend to @xmath169 ( harris & petrie 1978 ; rhode & zepf 2001 ) , we are unable to measure directly the level of its contamination by stars and background galaxies .",
    "the exact choice of background is , however , constrained by the fact that the corrected number density profile for all colors @xmath170 should be consistent with the shape of @xmath151 in figure  [ fig13 ] .",
    "the total background density , to the limiting magnitude of @xmath171 , estimated in this way is @xmath172 arcmin@xmath173 , or @xmath174 kpc@xmath173 .",
    "we then _ assume _ that the contaminating backgrounds to be subtracted from the separate metal - poor and metal - rich gc density profiles are 60% and 40% of the total @xmath175 .",
    "this 3:2 ratio is somewhat arbitrary , but it is consistent with that predicted by the ias galaxy model ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ; bahcall 1986 ) for foreground star counts to @xmath171 , in our color ranges , in the direction towards m49 .",
    "having thus obtained corrected , metal - poor and metal - rich gc surface density profiles , we fit each with projections of the same two three - dimensional functions that we fit to the full gc system . the results are shown in figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "the top panel presents fits of the nfw function , with an adopted background of @xmath176 arcmin@xmath173 . for the metal - poor and metal - rich gc samples in turn ,",
    "@xmath177 the dashed curves running through the open datapoints in the top panel of figure  [ fig14 ] are the projections of these functions .",
    "the bolder dashed curve is their sum ; it agrees reasonably well both with the observed density profile of metal - poor and metal - rich gcs _ combined _ in the catalog of lee ( 1998 ) ( filled circles ) , and with the nfw fit ( eq .  [ [ eq9 ] ] ; the bold , solid line ) to the combined data of mclaughlin ( 1999a ) and rhode & zepf ( 2001 ) in figure  [ fig13 ] .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig14 ] shows our projected fits of the dehnen ( 1993 ) density model to the metal - poor and metal - rich gc systems , @xmath178 where the adopted background in this case is @xmath179 arcmin@xmath173 .",
    "again , the sum of the two fits is shown as the bold , dashed curve .",
    "it is fairly consistent with the observed total gc surface densities and with the dehnen - model fit of equation ( [ eq10 ] ) .    unlike the case for the full gc system in figure  [ fig13 ] , we do not consider the density profiles for the gc metallicity subsample to be particularly well constrained .",
    "the limited spatial coverage of the lee catalog leaves much room for erroneous extrapolations to larger radii , and the lack of direct background density estimates makes the @xmath151 estimates for the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems too uncertain for our taste even at directly observed radii .",
    "it is nevertheless necessary to specify separate density profiles for the subsamples if their dynamics are to be modeled individually .",
    "note that estimates of the absolute normalizations of @xmath180 and @xmath181 are not required in the following analysis , since these cancel out of equation ( [ eq6 ] ) .      before going on to constrain the orbital parameters of the gcs in m49",
    ", we make a brief aside regarding the evidence for dark matter in m49 and the virgo b subcluster around it , about which various claims have been made over the years .",
    "mould ( 1990 ) argued on the basis of radial velocities for 26 gcs that the galaxy does indeed contain a dark halo , but they were unable to rule out the possibility of a constant mass - to - light ratio due to their small velocity sample and the unknown orbital properties of the gcs .",
    "working with a sample of 144 gc velocities , and assuming that gcs have isotropic orbits , zepf ( 2000 ) argued that the mass - to - light ratio at @xmath7 30 kpc ( 22.5 @xmath50 ) is at least five times that at a distance of a few kpc , implying the presence of substantial dark matter on large spatial scales .",
    "irwin & sarazin ( 1996 ) used rosat x - ray observations of the hot , gaseous corona around m49 to derive a mass profile for m49 extending to @xmath182 , leading them to conclude that dark matter must be present on spatial scales of @xmath183 .",
    "inside @xmath18415 kpc ( @xmath185 ) , however , irwin & sarazin found mass - to - light ratios that are perfectly compatible with the canonical stellar value in elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , brighenti & mathews ( 1997 ) later decomposed irwin & sarazin s ( 1996 ) mass distribution into separate stellar and dark - matter components ( as we also do , in  4.3 ) , and argued that any dark - matter halo must contribute negligibly to the total mass inside @xmath186 .",
    "saglia ( 1993 ) observed a flattening of the stellar velocity dispersion profile in m49 at a much smaller projected radius , @xmath187@xmath188 , and argued that this alone implied the presence of an dynamically dominant , extended dark - matter halo .",
    "however , the large scatter in independent measurements of the stellar kinematics beyond @xmath189 kpc ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , caon , macchetto & pastoriza 2000 ) rather weakens the conclusion ; and it is certainly possible to fit self - consistent galaxy models , containing no dark matter , to the stellar kinematics if no other data are considered ( _ e.g. _ , kronawitter 2000 ) .    our improved gc velocity dispersion profile from  3 can be used to look at this issue again .",

    "our measurement of the galaxy s effective radius is intermediate to the values of @xmath198 found by caon ( 1994 ) and that of kim ( 2000 ) , who obtained @xmath199 by fitting a de vaucouleurs law to the same data analyzed here . while the precise value of @xmath50 itself has no bearing on our conclusions",

    "as their figure  8 shows , the fitted model falls well below the measured brightness profile for @xmath201 , leading to likely underestimates of the galaxy s total luminosity and effective radius .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig15 ] illustrates the three - dimensional stellar mass density profile , @xmath202 , with @xmath203 the @xmath38-band mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we take its value from mclaughlin & ct ( 2003 ) , who show that the stellar kinematics at projected radii @xmath204 kpc in m49 are best fit by a mass model with no dark matter if @xmath205 _ and _ the velocity ellipsoid of the stellar distribution is slightly radially biased : @xmath206 .",
    "we note that this mass - to - light ratio corresponds to a @xmath193-band value of @xmath207 , typical of the cores of elliptical galaxies , and that this constant-@xmath208 mass model is very similar to the self - consistent galaxy model of kronawitter ( 2000 ) .",

    "taking @xmath211 , then , we solve equation ( [ eq6 ] ) for the intrinsic radial velocity dispersion profile of the stars in m49 by replacing @xmath143 with @xmath212 from equation ( [ eq13 ] ) , and by substituting @xmath213 ( mclaughlin & ct 2003 ) for @xmath149 .",

    "it does a respectable job of reproducing the observed velocity dispersions between @xmath215 kpc .",
    "although the success relies in part on the considerable scatter among the different datasets at @xmath216 kpc , the main point is that the stellar kinematics in m49 , by themselves , provide no conclusive evidence for the existence of any extended and massive dark - matter halo .",

    "evidently , the mass - to - light ratio must increase with galactocentric radius if the high velocity dispersion of the gcs is to be understood .",
    "regardless of any assumptions on its velocity anisotropy or uncertainties in its spatial distribution , the globular cluster system alone therefore provides incontrovertible evidence , independent of any x - ray data , for the presence of an extended dark - matter halo around m49 .",

    "however , the present comparison of the models shows that our inference of velocity isotropy in the m49 gc system does not rely on this particular choice .",
    "figure [ fig19 ] gives a close - up view of the comparison between the velocity dispersion data and a number of models for the full gc system .",

    "i.e. _ , the velocity dispersion of all objects interior to a given projected radius @xmath38 , rather than just those in a narrower annulus . for a model , this cumulative spatial average of @xmath94 is defined by @xmath239\\ ,    \\left[\\int_{r_{\\rm min}}^r n_{\\rm cl}(r^\\prime)\\,r^\\prime\\,dr^\\prime           \\right]^{-1}\\ , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] with @xmath240 the projected galactocentric radius of the innermost datapoint in a velocity sample ( @xmath241 kpc for us ) .",
    "although the interpretation of the coarsely averaged @xmath242 profile can be subtler than that of the differential profile @xmath94 , it has the significant advantage of reduced noise at large @xmath38 .",
    "the bold , solid line in the top panel of figure  [ fig19 ] is the same as that in figure  [ fig18 ] : the predicted @xmath94 profile for the full gc system in the mass distribution of equation ( [ eq16 ] ) , if @xmath143 is given by the nfw profile of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) and @xmath237 .",
    "the same curve in the bottom panel is just the result of averaging this model profile with equation ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "the bold , short - dashed curves in the two panels of the figure are analogous to the solid lines but assume the dehnen - model density profile of equation ( [ eq10 ] ) for the full gc system .",

    "the close adherence of the isotropic models to the gc data is striking , particularly in the case of the aperture dispersion profile .",
    "the spatial averaging involved there effectively blurs local , apparently noise - driven features in the differential @xmath94 data ( _ e.g. _ , the bump around @xmath244 kpc ) , such that the @xmath242 data never stray substantially from the predictions of isotropy for either assumed density profile @xmath143 .",
    "the possibility of even modestly radial or tangential average anisotropy ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath245 or @xmath331 ) can be ruled out at the 95% confidence level or better in the full gc system .    aside from its intrinsic importance for models of gc formation and evolution ,",
    "the finding of such a high degree of consistency with velocity isotropy in the full gc system could be of practical use for measurements of the gravitating mass profiles in other early - type galaxies , where data may not be available in the variety and quality required for the type of modeling that we described in  4.3 .",
    "m49 is now the second galaxy ( the other being m87 ) in which we have been able to show by direct means that an isotropic velocity ellipsoid is a highly accurate description of the gc kinematics .",
    "the _ assumption _ of isotropy in other gc systems may therefore be much better justified than before , making it possible to use the jeans equation ( [ eq6 ] ) with @xmath237  provided that @xmath143 is also well known  to derive @xmath146 from a set of velocity - dispersion measurements .",
    "finally , we construct dynamical models for the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subsystems separately .",
    "this is a somewhat riskier proposition , given the noisier dispersion profiles of these smaller datasets and the much poorer characterization of the density profiles @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( figure  [ fig14 ] in  4.1 ) . with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we compare the observed and predicted velocity dispersion profiles for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs in figures [ fig20 ] and [ fig21 ] .",
    "the various curves in these figures have meanings analogous to those in figure  [ fig19 ] . the bold , solid curves assume orbital isotropy and adopt the nfw fits for the density profiles of the subsystems ( eq .  [ [ eq11 ] ] ) , while the bold , short - dashed curves assume isotropy and the dehnen - model density profiles of equation ( [ eq12 ] ) . the light , long - dashed curves assume nfw density profiles and spatially constant anisotropies @xmath246 , 0.5 , @xmath331 , and @xmath3399 .",
    "the isotropic nfw density - model curve in figure  [ fig20 ] provides quite an acceptable description of the observed @xmath94 of the metal - poor globulars until radii @xmath24725 kpc , where the subsequent rise in the data might suggest a move to a slight radial bias in the gc orbits .",
    "however , the model remains within the 68% confidence bands on the measurements nearly until @xmath248 kpc , the limit of reliability .",
    "the observed @xmath242 data in the bottom panel adhere more closely to the isotropic curve at still larger radii .",
    "the model assuming a dehnen - type density profile for the metal - poor gc system gives a stronger suggestion of radial velocity anisotropy , although the isotropic case is still barely consistent ( within the 95% confidence bands ) with the observed profile .",
    "because of the increased noise in the measured dispersions and , more importantly , the poorly constrained density profile , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the orbital properties of the metal - poor gcs , beyond the obvious : ( 1 ) the hypothesis of isotropy is not far wrong , particularly at small galactocentric distances @xmath249 ; and ( 2 ) any possible radial bias present at larger projected radii is likely to be modest .",
    "an assessment of the orbital properties of the metal - rich gcs is necessarily more difficult .",
    "not only is the extrapolation of their observed density profile very uncertain , but the difficulties posed by the 10 rapidly rotating objects concentrated around @xmath140 kpc , as discussed in  3.2 , leave little in the way of data that can be compared reliably with any model .",
    "the top panel shows our smoothed velocity - dispersion profile from figure  [ fig06 ] , with those parts relying on any gc velocities from within @xmath250 excised .",
    "the most that can be said is that , at @xmath251 kpc , the data are once again consistent with velocity isotropy , regardless of which gc density profile @xmath181 is assumed . beyond this",
    ", however , the steep drop in @xmath94 appears unsupportable in _ any _ dynamical model that we have constructed .",
    "it is true that the outer - radius data point suggests some return to understandable behavior in the metal - rich gc system ( @xmath13 , 1-@xmath3 consistency with isotropy for either @xmath181 profile ) , but the trend of the cumulative @xmath252 profile ( towards model curves suggesting a strong tangential bias in the orbital distribution ) also suggests that the low velocity dispersion may be problematic .",
    "if the full gc system is perfectly isotropic , and the metal - poor component is fairly closely so , then it stands to reason that the metal - rich gc system should be close to isotropic as well .",
    "thus , its behavior beyond @xmath253 needs to be much better understood empirically before any dynamical sense can be made of it .",
    "we noted in  3 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , figure  [ fig05 ] ) that the low velocity dispersion of the metal - rich gcs is the manifestation of an absence of red objects with @xmath254  from our velocity survey , and a corresponding lack of metal - rich gcs with @xmath255  outside about one effective radius in the galaxy",
    ". it would be useful to know whether these are artifacts of our particular sample or indicative of something more profound .",
    "for instance , a velocity dispersion @xmath256  at galactocentric radii @xmath183 is even lower than we would expect for the _ stellar light _ of m49 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig18 ] ) . very closely related to this issue is the density profile of the metal - rich gc system , which will have to be defined reliably out to much larger radii than we have been able to do with existing databases .",
    "even the dehnen - model density profile that we explored here , with its behavior @xmath257 at large @xmath147 , predicts gc kinematics that seem considerably too `` hot '' compared with the metal - rich data .",
    "either current radial velocity surveys have missed a number of high - velocity , metal - rich gcs at large galactocentric radii  perhaps due to some observational bias or simple bad luck  or the density of metal - rich gcs system falls very rapidly indeed to zero beyond several tens of kpc .",
    "deep , wide - field imaging in a metallicity - sensitive filter combination can directly address the latter possibility , and it will be essential to developing any deeper understanding of gc dynamics in m49 .",
    "a direct comparison between the kinematic and dynamic properties of gcs in m49 and m87 seems in order , given the similarity in the respective datasets and the methods of analysis .",
    "in fact , the gc radial velocities now amassed for these galaxies constitute the two largest radial velocity samples yet assembled for pure population ii tracers in early - type galaxies .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that that the gc systems of these two galaxies are similar in many respects .",
    "for instance , both have bimodal metallicity distributions , with peaks at [ fe / h ] @xmath258 and @xmath330.3 dex .",
    "the ratio of the number of metal poor to metal rich gcs is very nearly the same in both galaxies .",
    "the gc formation efficiencies for the composite gc systems and the two subsystems are quite similar in both cases ( @xmath9 , mclaughlin 1999a ; ct 2003 ) .",
    "likewise , the measured ages of the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs suggest that they are  on the whole  old and _ roughly _ coeval ( cohen 1998 ; puzia 1999 ; beasley 2000 ; jordn 2002 ; cf .",
    "kundu 1999 and lee & kim 2000 ) .    to some extent",
    ", this similarity extends to the dynamical properties of the two gc systems .",
    "most notably , in both m49 and in m87 , the full gc system has an almost perfectly isotropic velocity dispersion tensor ( @xmath9 , compare figure  [ fig19 ] above with figure 13 of ct 2001 ) .",
    "there are , nevertheless , some clear differences in the overall gc kinematics between the two galaxies .",
    "for instance , the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems in m87 share an essentially identical projected velocity dispersion , while in m49 , the metal - rich gc sample appears to be significantly colder than the metal - poor component .",
    "table  [ tab4 ] summarizes the global kinematic properties of the two gc systems .",
    "note that the results for m87 differ slightly from those presented in ct ( 2001 ) since we have re - computed the various kinematic properties after fixing the systemic velocity of each gc subsample at the velocity of m87 ( @xmath259 ; van der marel 1994 ) , identical to the approach taken in  3 for m49 .",
    "in addition , we have re - calculated the global quantities for the full gc system and the metal - rich component in m49 , after removing the 10 rapidly rotating , metal - rich gcs at 22 @xmath260 24.5 kpc .",
    "as table  [ tab4 ] shows , it is in their rotation properties that obvious differences between the two systems appear . in m87 , both the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subsystems show relatively rapid rotation , with @xmath261 . in m49 , however , rotation is somewhat more modest among the metal - poor gcs ( @xmath262 ) , and it is very weak indeed in the metal - rich gc system ( @xmath263 of order 0.1 and consistent with 0 ) .",
    "the orientation of the rotation axes in the two systems is also noteworthy . in m87 , the metal - rich gcs",
    "are found to rotate , at all radii , about the galaxy s minor axis .",
    "this is also true of the metal - poor gcs beyond @xmath264 in that galaxy , but _ inside _ this radius , the metal - poor gcs in m87 show _ major - axis _ rotation ( see table  [ tab4 ] , and ct 2001 ) . in m49 ,",
    "the metal - poor gcs are consistent with minor - axis rotation inside @xmath265 and suggest a possible transition to major - axis rotation _ outside _ that radius .",
    "interestingly , the position angles for the rotation axes of the stellar light in m87 and m49 are found to be @xmath266 and @xmath267 , respectively ( davies & birkinshaw 1988 ) .",
    "thus , to within the measurement errors , and over the range where the gc and stellar data overlap , the metal - poor gcs in both cases seem to trace the rotation of the underlying galaxy",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the stellar kinematic measurements to larger radii , to see if this trend continues , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the stellar rotation axis also `` flips '' by 90@xmath268 in m87 especially .",
    "finally , at the radii in m87 where the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs both rotate about the minor axis , they do so in the same direction .",
    "by contrast , there is some evidence that the metal - rich gc system of m49 may rotate _",
    "counter _ to the metal - poor one .",
    "we caution that this result is of low statistical significance , as we have a sample of only @xmath7 100 red gcs spread over an order - of - magnitude range in galactocentric position , but it clearly merits further attention .    these differences between the gc systems of m49 and",
    "m87 become all the more puzzling when one considers the results for the gc systems of late - type galaxies . to date ,",
    "in only two spiral galaxies have samples of a hundred or more gc velocities been accumulated : the milky way and m31 . in the former case , @xmath269 for the gc system as a whole , and @xmath270 and @xmath271 for the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems ( ct 1999 ) . in m31 ,",
    "the global value for all gcs is @xmath272 , with the metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems having @xmath273 @xmath274 and @xmath275 ( perrett 2002 ) .",
    "based on this very small sample , it seems that rotation may be more important for the gc systems of disk galaxies than for those of ellipticals .",
    "clearly , however , the four gc systems show considerable diversity in their rotational properties .",
    "it seems that the lone common feature among the gc systems of these four galaxies is the tendency for the metal - poor gcs to form a rotating population , albeit with widely varying levels of dynamical importance ( @xmath13 , the percentage of total kinetic energy stored in rotation varies by more than an order of magnitude , from @xmath276 in m49 to @xmath277 for m31 ) .",
    "furthermore , the metal - rich gcs of m87 , m31 , and the milky way _ also _ form rotating populations with @xmath278 ratios that are equal to or greater than those of their metal - poor counterparts .",
    "in this regard , the metal - rich gc subsystem in m49 may be something of an anomaly  although such a conclusion may be premature given the current data .",
    "the kinematic properties of the gc systems studied to date undoubtedly contain important clues to the formation histories of their parent galaxies , although the full implications at this point remain unclear .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the traditional picture of gc systems as non - rotating , or slowly rotating , entities  a view that can be traced to the slow rotation exhibited by halo gcs outside of the central few kpc in the milky way  may be in need of revision .",
    "the net gc rotation detected in an ever - increasing number of galaxies , which we speculate may be a common property of gc systems , probably reflects the outcome of a complex interplay between any number of processes that could have shaped the observed gc velocity fields : tidal torques from neighboring galaxies , spin - up during gravitational collapse , angular momentum transfer and energy dissipation during gaseous mergers , and the conversion of orbital angular momentum to rotation during gas - poor mergers and accretions .",
    "the extraction of quantitative predictions for gc dynamics from models of these processes will be a challenging task  as will be the complete and accurate empirical characterization of kinematics to test those predictions .",
    "we have reported radial velocities for 196 gcs associated with m49 , the brightest member of the virgo cluster .",
    "combining these velocities with previously published measurements brings the total number of gcs with measured radial velocities to 263 .",
    "this sample is comparable to that assembled recently for m87 ( hanes 2001 ) in terms of size , spatial coverage , velocity precision , and the availability of metallicities from washington photometry . using these data ,",
    "we have carried out a kinematical and dynamical analysis of the m49 gc system which mirrors that presented recently for m87 by ct ( 2001 ) .",
    "we confirm previous findings that , when considered in its entirety , the gc system of m49 shows a modest net rotation that is due almost entirely to the rotation of the metal - poor subsystem . likewise",
    ", we verify that , in a global average , the metal - rich subsystem shows essentially no rotation .",
    "however , when examined in greater detail , there is some weak evidence that the metal - rich gcs in this galaxy may , in fact , be slowly rotating , but in the opposite direction to the metal - poor gcs .",
    "the overall negligible global rotation of the metal - rich component is traced to a small sample of 10 clusters which appear to show very rapid minor - axis rotation , in the same direction as the metal - poor gcs .",
    "these objects merit further attention , as they may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event . given the rather limited sample of metal - rich gcs with measured velocities , the significance of these findings must await additional radial velocity measurements , but it is abundantly clear that conclusions formed on the basis of globally averaged kinematics are likely to miss potentially interesting and complex variations within a given gc system .",
    "a comparison with the results for m87 , m31 and the milky way suggests that rotation may , in fact , be generic to gc systems , a turnabout from the traditional view of gc populations as slowly rotating systems .",
    "any trends in gc rotational properties with metallicity seem to be quite complex , and will likely require gc radial velocity data for an expanded sample of galaxies before they can be better characterized and understood .",
    "we note , however , that in m49 and m87 , there is a hint that the orientation of the rotation axes for the metal - poor gcs trace those of the underlying galaxy .",
    "previous studies of m49 , its gc system , and its x - ray halo have produced some conflicting claims on the need for dark matter .",
    "we have shown that the gc radial velocities and density profiles alone now provide unmistakable evidence for a massive dark halo in m49/virgo b. this result , which is corroborated by analyses of its x - ray halo but is independent of the x - ray observations , holds for any choice of gc orbital properties .",
    "we have presented a mass model for m49/virgo b that satisfies all existing observational constraints on the mass distribution from optical and x - ray surface brightness profiles and stellar kinematical data .",
    "a jeans - equation analysis of the gc radial velocities and density profiles using this mass model reveals the gc system as a whole to be perfectly well described by an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "this is also likely to be true of the separate metal - poor and metal - rich subsystems , but definite conclusions must await the measurement of additional radial velocities and improved surface density profiles for the subpopulations . indeed",
    ", the poorly constrained density distributions of metal - poor and metal - rich gcs on large scales may now be the principal obstacle limiting our understanding their orbital properties . in any case , the demonstration that the composite gc system of m49 , like that of m87 , has an almost perfectly isotropic velocity dispersion tensor lends support to the general assumption of isotropy when using the gc systems of early - type galaxies to derive gravitational masses .",

    "<S> using the low resolution imaging spectrometer on the keck i and ii telescopes , we have measured radial velocities for 196 globular clusters ( gcs ) around m49 ( ngc  4472 ) , the brightest member of the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> combined with published data , they bring the total number of gcs with measured radial velocities in this galaxy to 263 . in terms of sample size , spatial coverage , velocity precision , and the availability of metallicity estimates from washington photometry , this radial velocity database resembles that presented recently for m87 ( ngc  4486 ) , virgo s cd galaxy and its second - ranked member .    </S>",
    "<S> we extract the projected kinematics of the full sample of gcs and of separate subsamples of 158 metal - poor and 105 metal - rich gcs . in agreement with previous results for the global gc kinematics based on smaller datasets , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gc system as a whole exhibits a slow overall rotation that is due almost entirely to a net rotation of the metal - poor gc subsystem alone . in a spatial average </S>",
    "<S> , the metal - rich gcs shows essentially no rotation . as a function of galactocentric position , </S>",
    "<S> the metal - poor gcs rotate roughly about the photometric minor axis of m49 and at an approximately constant level of @xmath0150  km  s@xmath1 out to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the metal - rich gc system shows some evidence ( at roughly 1-@xmath3 significance ) for weak rotation ( @xmath4 ) beyond @xmath5 , also about the galaxy s minor - axis , _ but in the opposite direction from the metal - poor gcs_. outside of @xmath6 , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the metal - poor gcs exceeds that of their metal - rich counterparts by @xmath7 50% . </S>",
    "<S> we also note the presence of a well defined grouping of 10 metal - rich gcs that are located at opposite poles along the galaxy s major axis and which appear to be rotating at nearly 300  about the minor axis </S>",
    "<S> . this grouping may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the gc system are modeled by using published catalogs and number counts to define three - dimensional gc density distributions as input to a jeans - equation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gc radial velocities alone point unequivocally  and independently of x - ray observations  to the need for a massive dark halo associated with m49 and the virgo b subcluster around it . </S>",
    "<S> we then use a mass model for m49/virgo b , constructed without reference to any gc data and described in detail in a forthcoming paper , to infer the orbital properties of the m49 globulars . _ the gc system as a whole </S>",
    "<S> is shown to be consistent with an almost perfectly isotropic velocity ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> _ it is more difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the orbital ( an)isotropy of the two metallicity subsamples , owing to the large uncertainties in their individual spatial density profiles and to the poorly observationally defined kinematics of the metal - rich gcs in particular .    </S>",
    "<S> after m87 , m49 is the second elliptical galaxy for which we have been able to demonstrate velocity isotropy in the globular cluster system overall , when no division based on gc color or metallicity is attempted . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the data for these two galaxies lend support the general _ assumption _ of isotropy when using gc kinematics to study the dark - matter distribution in early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the kinematic properties of the gc system of m49 to those of m87 , m31 , and the milky way : the other galaxies for which samples of one hundred or more gc velocities have been accumulated . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that , contrary to the traditional view of gcs as non - rotating , or slowly rotating , systems , rotation may in fact be common byproduct of the formation of gc systems </S>",
    "<S> . however , the quantitative details of the rotation are still not clear , particularly with regard to the question of possible differences between metal - poor and metal - rich globulars .    2 </S>"
