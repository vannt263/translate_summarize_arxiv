    ", we generalize the specialization inequality to varieties of arbitrary dimension using tropical complexes .",
    "similar to the case of curves , our specialization inequality applies to a regular , strictly semistable degeneration  @xmath0 over a discrete valuation ring .",

    "4 ) introduced both a specialization map  @xmath2 from divisors on the general fiber of  @xmath0 to the tropical complex  @xmath1 as well as a compatible notion of linear equivalence on  @xmath1 .",
    "we define @xmath3 of a divisor on  @xmath1 as the fewest number of points such that no linearly effective divisor contains all of these points ( see def .",
    "[ def : h0 ] for details ) , and then prove a specialization inequality :    [ thm : specialization ] let @xmath0 be a regular strictly semistable degeneration of relative dimension  @xmath4 over a discrete valuation ring .",
    "further suppose that the locally closed strata of dimension at most @xmath5 in @xmath0 are affine and that @xmath0 is robust in dimensions @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath7 is any divisor on the general fiber @xmath8 of  @xmath0 , and @xmath1 is the tropical complex of  @xmath0 , then we have : @xmath9    the second sentence of theorem  [ thm : specialization ] places additional requirements on the degeneration beyond the strict semistability , whose definitions we now explain .",
    "a _ closed stratum _ of dimension @xmath10 in  @xmath0 is a connected component of the intersection of any @xmath11 components of the special fiber .",
    "the _ locally closed stratum _ is formed by removing all lower - dimensional closed strata from a fixed closed stratum , and so theorem  [ thm : specialization ] requires that these differences are affine varieties , when they have dimension at most @xmath5 . for the closed strata of dimension  @xmath6 and @xmath4 , theorem  [ thm : specialization ] puts a weaker condition of _ robustness _ , which means that the union of the lower dimensional strata form a big divisor , in the sense of birational geometry  ( * ? ? ?",
    "although theorem  [ thm : specialization ] does not apply directly to all regular semistable degenerations because of these hypotheses , we note that any regular semistable degeneration whose special fiber has projective components can be modified into one with affine locally closed strata by a sequence of blow - ups  ( * ? ? ?",

    "we outline the structure of the proof , which will also serve to explain the necessity of the robustness and affineness hypotheses in theorem  [ thm : specialization ] . following the proof of the specialization inequality for curves",
    ", our specialization inequality essentially follows from our definition of  @xmath3 given a specialization function which preserves linear equivalence , effectivity of divisors , and point containment .",
    "compatibility of linear equivalence was proved in  @xcite .",
    "however , the specialization  @xmath12 of an effective divisor  @xmath7 is not always effective , so we introduce a refined specialization in section  [ sec : refined ] , which is always effective , and is an element of the same complete linear series as  @xmath12 .",
    "note that the refined specialization is not necessarily supported on the @xmath13-dimensional simplices of  @xmath1 , which is one reason why it is important for us to consider divisors which are not just linear combinations of the ridges .",
    "although our proof does not use this technology explicitly , the refined specialization of a divisor  @xmath7 can be understood in terms of the projection of @xmath7 to the skeleton of the berkovich analytification .",
    "more specifically , by results going back to berkovich  @xcite , the dual complex  @xmath1 embeds into , and is a strong deformation retract of , the analytification of the general fiber of  @xmath0 .",
    "restricting to effective divisors in order to avoid cancellation , we have :    [ prop : analytification ] if @xmath7 is an effective divisor in the general fiber of  @xmath0 , then the projection of the analytification of @xmath7 to the skeleton defined by @xmath0 equals the support of the refined specialization of  @xmath7 , except on a set of codimension  2 or greater .",
    "while the projection of the analytification always preserves point containment , proposition  [ prop : analytification ] shows that the same can fail for the refined tropicalization whenever the projection has components of codimension  2 or greater .",
    "the purpose of the robustness and affineness hypotheses in theorem  [ thm : specialization ] are so that we can lift points from the tropical complex to the algebraic variety in such a way that containing divisors project to a set of codimension  1 on  @xmath1 .",
    "also , note that , in the case of curves , the set of codimension  2 in proposition  [ prop : analytification ] is necessarily empty , which is why the specialization inequality for curves required no hypotheses beyond a strictly semistable degeneration .    as an application of theorem  [ thm : specialization ] , we give an example of a tropical complex which does not lift to any algebraic variety .",
    "[ thm : no - lift ] there exists a @xmath14-dimensional tropical complex  @xmath1 which is not the tropical complex of any regular semistable degeneration .",
    "the underlying @xmath1-complex of the example in theorem  [ thm : no - lift ] is a triangulation of the product of a cycle and an interval .",
    "therefore , the dual complex is realizable from a degeneration of an algebraic surface , such as the product of an elliptic curve with a projective line .",
    "however , in theorem  [ thm : no - lift ] the structure constants of the tropical complex  @xmath1 are chosen so that for any divisor @xmath7 , @xmath15 grows at most linearly in  @xmath4 , which combined with theorem  [ thm : specialization ] , shows that @xmath1 ca nt be the tropical complex of a projective surface .",
    "an alternative approach to a specialization inequality has been developed in unpublished work of eric katz and june huh .",
    "they work not with degenerations , but with tropicalizations of surfaces embedded in @xmath16 over a field with trivial valuation .",
    "moreover , their proof involves choosing linearly equivalent divisors passing through the lowest dimensional toric strata , as opposed to the proof of theorem  [ thm : specialization ] in which points are lifted from the @xmath4-dimensional locally closed strata .",
    "therefore , the two approaches should give distinct and possibly complementary bounds on the dimension of linear series .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : tropical - complexes ] recalls the definition of tropical complexes from  @xcite as well as their main properties . in section  [ sec : linear - series ] , we define the invariant  @xmath3 from theorem  [ thm : specialization ] and look at some examples and applications .",

    "while our definition requires the points to be distinct and rational , the former does nt affect the definition except when @xmath55 has only one point , and nor does the latter , because in the case of curves , we can prove conjecture  [ conj : non - rational - points ] :    [ prop : agree - curve ] if @xmath55 is a @xmath54-dimensional tropical complex which is not a point and @xmath57 is the rank of a divisor  @xmath7 as in  @xcite , then @xmath58 .",

    "therefore , the base locus of  @xmath101 contains all but one connected component of  @xmath101 . by taking just that connected component , we ve only removed fixed divisors , and so we still have a big divisor , which is the desired statement .",

    "we first consider the case that @xmath36 is generically finite on  @xmath8 . then",
    ", @xmath283 , so for any point in @xmath284 , we can take an intersection with a general linear space to obtain a curve through @xmath285 which does nt intersect @xmath286 . by taking the preimage",

    "since @xmath101 is big , such curves ca nt exist , and so we get a contradiction .",
    "second , we suppose that @xmath36 is not generically finite on  @xmath8 , but still that @xmath282",
    ". then for any point in @xmath287 , the fiber of  @xmath36 is at least @xmath54-dimensional and we can choose a curve in this fiber .",
    "again , we ve constructed curves in  @xmath8 which pass through sufficiently general points , and which do not intersect  @xmath101 , so we ve again contradicted our assumption that @xmath101 is big .    because @xmath288 is algebraically closed",
    ", we can choose a general point  @xmath289 in  @xmath263 .",
    "by general , we mean that it lies outside of finitely many closed subvarieties , which do nt depend on  @xmath101 and will be made explicit in the course of the proof . by hensel s lemma",
    ", we can lift the point  @xmath289 to an @xmath44-point of  @xmath0 , which will give the desired point  @xmath114 .",
    "now let @xmath101 be any divisor of @xmath125 containing @xmath114 and we first want to show that its closure @xmath127 in @xmath0 intersects some @xmath54-dimensional stratum  @xmath32 . if the dimension  @xmath4 is  @xmath54 , then this is immediate , so we assume that @xmath265 . by assumption",

    "we can assume that our choice of  @xmath289 was in the locus where @xmath292 defines an isomorphism onto its image .",
    "since @xmath127 contains @xmath289 , the restriction of  @xmath292 to  @xmath293 must also be birational onto its image .",
    "since this restriction is defined by the pullback of the same multiple of @xmath290 , we see that @xmath294 is a big divisor on  @xmath295 .    by lemma  [ lem : big - connected ] , we can take @xmath296 to be a connected component of @xmath294 which is a big divisor on  @xmath295 .",
    "since @xmath296 is connected , it is either contained in a single stratum  @xmath297 for some edge  @xmath69 or it meets some @xmath298 , where @xmath86 is a @xmath14-simplex of  @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath299 , then @xmath297 is a @xmath54-dimensional stratum intersecting @xmath127 , which is what we wanted to show .",
    "so , we assume that @xmath300 and , for the moment , we also assume that @xmath296 is contained in a single  @xmath297 .    by assumption , @xmath301 is a big divisor in @xmath297 , so some multiple of  @xmath301 defines a map @xmath302 , birational onto its image .",
    "since this morphism is just defined by a collection of rational functions on @xmath297 , we can extend it to a rational map from  @xmath31 to  @xmath303 , also denoted by  @xmath304 .",
    "the image  @xmath305 contains the image of  @xmath297 , so it is at least @xmath13-dimensional .",
    "therefore , a general fiber of @xmath304 is at most @xmath54-dimensional , so we can assume that @xmath306 , the fiber containing  @xmath289 , has dimension at most  @xmath54 .",
    "thus , @xmath307 must be at least @xmath23-dimensional .",
    "we apply lemma  [ lem : contract - big ] to the restriction  @xmath308 , and in either of that lemma s two cases , @xmath309 is also at least @xmath23-dimensional .",
    "since @xmath309 is positive dimensional , it intersects any hyperplane in @xmath303 , which shows that @xmath296 must intersect @xmath301 , and thus @xmath298 for some @xmath14-simplex  @xmath86 .    at this point , we ve shown that if @xmath310 , then @xmath127 intersects @xmath32 for some ridge  @xmath19 containing  @xmath18 . if @xmath311 , then @xmath127 at least intersects @xmath298 for some @xmath14-simplex  @xmath86 containing  @xmath18 , but we can then apply proposition  [ prop : locally - closed - affine ] to show that @xmath127 intersects some @xmath32 for some ridge containing  @xmath18 in this case as well .",
    "we now consider the resolution of the base change  @xmath206 produced by lemma  [ lem : fine - effective ] .",
    "there are two cases , depending on whether or not there exists a facet  @xmath40 containing  @xmath19 such that @xmath127 contains the point  @xmath258 .",
    "if there does , then we consider the component @xmath312 in  @xmath206 corresponding to  @xmath18 , which maps birationally onto @xmath31 . by the properness of the resolution",
    ", there must be a point in @xmath313 mapping to the point @xmath258 , where @xmath314 is the closure of @xmath101 in  @xmath206 .",
    "however , the fiber of @xmath258 in the resolution  @xmath206 is a union of toric varieties intersecting along their toric boundaries and so by proposition  [ prop : locally - closed - affine ] , @xmath314 must intersect one of the @xmath54-dimensional strata in this fiber . by lemma  [ lem : fine - effective ] , this intersection is proper , so it gives a positive coefficient to some ridge containing  @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that @xmath127 does not intersect @xmath258 for any facet  @xmath40 containing  @xmath19 .",
    "we ve assumed that @xmath315 is a big divisor on  @xmath32 , so it is a non - trivial divisor . in other words",
    ", there is at least one stratum @xmath258 properly contained in @xmath32 . since @xmath127 does not contain any @xmath258 , it must intersect @xmath32 properly , and thus with positive intersection number .",
    "now we choose a ridge  @xmath25 containing @xmath18 in the subdivision of  @xmath19 and then the corresponding stratum @xmath316 of  @xmath206 maps surjectively onto @xmath32 . by the projection formula",
    ", this implies that the intersection number of @xmath317 with @xmath316 is positive , where @xmath239 is the map from  @xmath206 to  @xmath0 .",
    "of course , @xmath317 is not the same as  @xmath314 , but also includes any components of the special fiber whose image is contained in @xmath127 .",
    "however , the only such components which affect the intersection number will be those which meet @xmath316 , in which case the projection of the component onto @xmath0 must be either @xmath32 or a point @xmath258 contained in @xmath32 .",
    "however , we ve assumed that in neither of these can be contained in  @xmath127 , so @xmath318 is positive , which shows that the ridge @xmath25 containing  @xmath18 occurs with positive coefficient in the refined specialization , as desired .",
    "we now have one lemma remaining before finishing the proof . while lemma  [ lem : lifting - point ] shows how to find a divisor whose refined specialization contains a given vertex , our definition of  @xmath3 allowed arbitrary rational points",
    ". we can turn arbitrary rational points into vertices by choosing an appropriate subdivision , but we need to check that such a subdivision preserves the robustness and affineness properties of the degeneration .    [",
