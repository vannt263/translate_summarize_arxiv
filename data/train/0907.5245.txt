    "eselevich m. and v. @xcite revealed that there is a disturbed region extended along the direction of coronal mass ejection ( cme ) propagation in front of the cme , when its velocity @xmath2 relative to the ambient coronal plasma is below a certain critical velocity @xmath3 . given @xmath4 , a discontinuity in the difference brightness distributions",
    "is formed in the frontal part of the disturbed region . since @xmath3 is close to the local fast - mode mhd velocity the formation of such a discontinuity",
    "may be associated with shock wave formation .",
    "if we managed to resolve this discontinuity in space , determining its thickness @xmath5 ( by measuring the shock front profile , in essence ) , we could be able to clarify the dissipation mechanism in the shock front in the corona .",
    "the purpose of this paper is : 1 ) to justify the correctness of @xmath5 measurements in the solar corona using mark 4 and lasco c2 ; 2 ) to discuss a possible dissipation mechanism in the shock front based on measurements of the shock wave thickness @xmath5 .",
    "this analysis involved coronal images obtained by lasco c2 and c3 onboard the soho spacecraft @xcite , presented as difference brightness @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is undisturbed brightness at a moment @xmath8 , before the event considered ; @xmath9 is disturbed brightness at @xmath10 .",
    "we used calibrated lasco images with the total brightness @xmath9 expressed in units of the mean solar brightness ( p@xmath11 ) .",
    "the difference brightness images were employed to study the dynamics of the cme and its disturbed region . for this purpose , we used maps of @xmath12 isolines as well as sections along the sun s radius at fixed position angles @xmath13 and non - radial sections at various times . in the images ,",
    "the position angle @xmath13 was counterclockwise from the sun s northern pole .    at 1.2 r@xmath14 r@xmath1 , we employed polarization brightness images from the ground - based coronagraph - polarimeter mark 4 ( mauna loa solar observatory ) . as was the case with lasco data ,",
    "these images were expressed in terms of difference brightness .",
    "to identify a shock front in cme images is best done by tracing the process of its formation .",
    "let us examine such a process on the example of cme 1 , which occurred at the w limb on 20 september 1997 at about 10:00 ut . in that event ,",
    "the coronal ejection had a distinct three - part structure consisting of a frontal structure ( fs ) , cavity , and bright core .",
    "figure 1 ( three top panels ) presents the difference brightness in the form of isolines for three subsequent instants of time corresponding to the cme motion .",
    "the shape of the cme frontal structure is close to a circle ( dotted circle in figure 1 ) .",
    "the process of shock wave formation can be seen in detail on difference brightness distributions @xmath15 plotted along the direction of the cme motion ( dashed line in the top panels of figure 1 ) .",
    "each difference brightness distribution @xmath16 plotted at a given instant was ( see bottom panel in figure 1 ) :    1 .",
    "normalized to a corresponding maximum value of difference brightness measured in the vicinity of the frontal structure ; 2 .   displaced along the distance axis",
    "@xmath17 in such a way that the frontal structure position on the axis coincided with its position at the moment of its first registration by lasco c2",
    ". thus the coordinate system was tied with the frontal structure .",
    "the disturbed region is almost absent at the initial instant ( solid circles ) in front of the frontal structure ( slanting hatching in the figure ) . at the next moment ( empty circles ) a compressed plasma region emerges in front of the fs , bounded by the shock in its frontal part ( crosshatching ) . the shock moves faster than the frontal structure and at subsequent moments of time ( diamonds and triangles )",
    "is seen to be far ahead of the frontal structure .",
    "conversely , the anterior boundary of the core lags behind the frontal structure , because of a lower velocity .",
    "any density inhomogeneity in the magnetized coronal plasma can only be stationary thanks to magnetic field inhomogeneity , which is equivalent to the presence of current on the same scale .",
    "the thickness of quiescent current sheet @xmath18 expanding due to diffusion can be estimated , via time @xmath19 , from the following relation @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mean time between electron - proton collisions ( here @xmath22 in degrees and @xmath23 in @xmath24 ) .",
    "let us estimate @xmath18 for our conditions .",
    "assuming , in accordance with @xcite , that , at @xmath25 2.1 r@xmath1 , plasma temperature @xmath26 k , magnetic field @xmath27 0.55 g , and density @xmath28 @xmath24 we obtain @xmath29 r@xmath1 and @xmath30 3 s. hence during cme propagation in the corona ( for several hours ) , the current sheet thickness does not exceed @xmath31 ( @xmath32 r@xmath1 ) which is much less than the spatial resolution of mark 4 and c2 ( @xmath33 0.02 r@xmath1 ) .",
    "this means that the minimal measured current sheet thickness is , at best , close to the spatial resolution of the instruments in use .",
    "however , the motion of the whole current sheet generates in front a disturbed region due to piled - up background plasma particles and to excitation of plasma density and magnetic field variations . in this case",
    ", the image brightness jump corresponding to the current sheet will have an enhanced size due to the effect of the disturbed region .",
    "the brightness jump in the shock front is also related to the density inhomogeneity on the scale of the front .",
    "inherently , however , it differs significantly from the current sheet : deceleration and heating of the supersonic plasma stream occur in the shock front .",
    "a disturbed region is absent ahead of the shock front as it moves at supersonic speed relative to the environment , and hence the shock front profile does not undergo distortions .",
    "we determined the current sheet thickness at the frontal structure boundary as double the size of the brightness jump at half the jump height ( @xmath18 in the bottom panel in figure  1 ) . besides , it is possible to determine the current sheet thickness @xmath34 at the core boundary .",
    "this value is shown in figure  1 only schematically , because the maximum core brightness , which , in reality , is much larger , was intentionally limited in the plot .",
    "similarly , figure 1 illustrates the determination of the thickness of a shock front the brightness jump in which has a typical size @xmath5 .    to understand how we can distinguish the current sheet from a shock wave ,",
    "let us consider cme 2 that occurred at the w limb on 2 june 1998 at about 08:00 ut . in that event ( in contrast to the event of 20 september 1997 ) , the cme velocity was lower than the critical one , and no shock wave formation was observed , at least in the c2 field of view ( i.e. up to @xmath35 6 r@xmath1 ) .",
    "the top panel in figure  2 shows the difference brightness at 10:05 ut for the event . a three - part structure ( fs , cavity and core )",
    "may also be discerned in the event , but there was a rather extended disturbed region in front of the cme in the direction of its motion .    approximating the shape of the frontal structure as a circle ( dots in the top panel of figure 2 ) enables us to determine how the current sheet size changes at the front boundary of the frontal structure in various directions . for this purpose , we plotted difference brightness sections from the frontal structure center .",
    "these sections were used to estimate the current sheet size @xmath18 .",
    "the position of each of these sections was specified by the angle @xmath36 drawn from the frontal structure center .",
    "this angle was measured from the direction of cme propagation .",
    "the change in this angle is positive counterclockwise .    in the bottom panel of figure  2 ,",
    "black circles indicate the dependence of @xmath18 on angle @xmath36 for cme 2 at 10:05 ut . there was a developed disturbed region ahead of the frontal structure ( the maximum distance of the frontal structure was @xmath35 3.5 r@xmath1 ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath18 was nearly five times as large in the direction of the cme motion than in lateral directions ( @xmath37 ) ( figure 2 , solid circles ) . in cme 1 at 10:19 ut (",
    "the maximum distance of the frontal structure from the solar center at this instant was @xmath35 2.2 r@xmath1 ) , the shock front was not observed yet , and @xmath18 could also be determined at various angles ( empty circles in the bottom panel in figure  2 ) .",
    "the @xmath18 thickness is seen to be approximately constant ( 0.15 r@xmath1 ) , only increasing about twofold in the direction of cme motion ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "hence the development of a disturbed region may result in increased apparent thickness @xmath18 .",
    "the disturbed region is only slightly visible and @xmath18 is the smallest at large angles @xmath36 ( in lateral directions ) .",
    "a similar angle @xmath36 dependence can also be plotted for the shock front thickness @xmath5 . in the bottom panel of figure 2",
    ", crosses mark the @xmath39 plot for cme 1 at 11:09 ut , when the maximum distance of the shock front was @xmath35 4.8 r@xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the behavior of @xmath39 differs from that of @xmath40 .",
    "this difference may be due to the lack of a disturbed region ahead of the shock front . in that case",
    ", the shock front thickness may depend on local parameters of the ambient plasma as well as on the velocity component along the normal to the shock front ( which decreases with increasing angle @xmath36 )  the shock wave type may change in that case .",
    "what is the minimum thickness to be recorded by mark 4 and lasco c2 for the current sheet in the corona ?",
    "evidently the effect of widening in the optically thin corona will be smallest for the current sheet whose size is smallest along the line of sight .",
    "an example is the boundary of the erupting filament in the form of a thin loop , whose size is sufficiently small along the line of sight .",
    "the top panel in figure  3 presents the difference polarization brightness from mark 4 data for the cme that commenced at the w limb on 28 june 2000 at about 19:00 ut . in that event one could observe a filament eruption easily discernible both in mark 4 and lasco c2 images",
    "this event allows us to estimate and compare the mark 4 and c2 resolutions . for the purpose , we plotted difference brightness profiles across the filament loop along the dashed line passing through the filament center ( figure  3 , top panel ) .",
    "difference brightness profiles normalized to the maximum brightness and shifted in such a manner that their maxima coincided ( bottom panel in figure  3 ) .",
    "the plot shows that the spatial size of the brightness jump at the filament boundary remains constant , @xmath41 0.045 r@xmath1 , over the entire range @xmath25 1.3 r@xmath1 to @xmath25 6.1 r@xmath1 .",
    "this value is close to the spatial resolution of mark 4 and c2 ( @xmath33 0.02 r@xmath1 ) .",
    "the main contribution to the jump widening appears to be by the disturbed region .",
    "thus it is possible to assume that the observable shock wave thickness ( @xmath42 0.2 r@xmath1 in the bottom panel of figure  2 ) reflects its real size , as there are no disturbances ahead of the shock front , while the measured shock wave thickness is essentially larger than the spatial resolution of the instrument .",
    "notably , calculations for a simple geometric model of quasi - spherical shock @xcite show that the observable brightness profile width @xmath5 was close to width @xmath43 for the density jump in the shock wave .",
    "the measured front size @xmath5 allows us to answer the question of whether the mechanism of energy dissipation in the shock wave is collisionless @xcite or collisional @xcite .    if it is collisionless , energy dissipation in a shock wave is conditioned by collective processes in plasma due to developing instabilities . in this case , it is quasi - parallel shocks that have maximum front thickness in the magnetized plasma , that does not exceed @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the proton larmor radius calculated from undisturbed magnetic field directly ahead of the front @xcite . to estimate the larmor radius , we take the coronal magnetic field @xmath46 0.5 g and the proton velocity @xmath47 km / s for the fastest cme case .",
    "we have : @xmath48 r@xmath49 . obviously , the collisionless shock wave front thickness is well below the resolution limit of modern coronagraphs .",
    "measurements show , however , that the front thickness far exceeds this value .",
    "this suggests that the dissipation mechanism in the shock wave is collisional in the corona . in this case , the shock wave energy dissipation is on the scale of order of the proton mean free path @xmath50 and hence it is also the scale that determines the shock wave thickness @xcite .",
    "the proton mean free path expressed in solar radii is @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the proton temperature ( degrees ) and density ( @xmath24 ) in the undisturbed plasma immediately ahead of the shock front .",
    "compare the observable shock wave front thickness @xmath5 with @xmath50 in the corona .",
    "the upper dashed curve in figure  4 is for @xmath50 calculated for the proton temperature and density measured by @xcite .",
    "the lower dashed line is for @xmath50 calculated for the same density and the temperature half as high as the measurements ( @xmath52 k at 2 r@xmath1 ) , but suffering the same decay with distance .",
    "these two dashed curves define roughly the lower and upper boundaries in estimating the free path depending on the chosen temperature .",
    "the experimental dependence @xmath53 was plotted from the shock wave front thickness measured at different distances for eight cmes with velocities @xmath4 ( symbols in figure 4 ) .",
    "the mean curve fitting these data is the thin solid line in figure  4 .",
    "the characteristic front size is comparable with the free path ( @xmath54 ) , at least up to @xmath335 r@xmath1 .",
    "this confirms the assumption that the dissipation mechanism in the shock wave may be collisional at these distances .",
    "the condition @xmath54 is no valid at greater distances and the shock wave must become collisionless .",
    "we did observe a gradual transition to formation of a collisionless shock front with thickness @xmath55 at @xmath56 10 r@xmath1 .",
    "this will be dealt with in more detail in a future paper .",
    "thus , we appear to encounter a rare situation where we can resolve and examine the collisional shock front structure in plasma .",
    "the measured thickness of the shock wave , excited ahead of a cme , far exceeds the spatial resolution of mark 4 and lasco c2 coronagraphs . up to the distance",
    "@xmath0 5 r@xmath1 from the center of the sun the thickness is of order of the proton mean free path .",
