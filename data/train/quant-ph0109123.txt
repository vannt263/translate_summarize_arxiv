    "a  single quantum oscillator has multiple modes of oscillation . for example",
    "a spin @xmath2 particle in a magnetic field has two modes of oscillation and is referred to as a _",
    "qubit_. furthermore , it is in general in both of these simultaneously .",
    "this is in contrast to a classical oscillator which just has a single mode of oscillation .",
    "therefore if we need @xmath0 modes of oscillation , we will need at least @xmath0 classical oscillators , while if we use quantum oscillators , each of which has two modes of oscillation ( qubits ) , we could do with just @xmath3 oscillators .    quantum computing algorithms , such as quantum search ,",
    "make use of the fact that a quantum system is simultaneously in multiple states to carry out certain computations in parallel in the same hardware . to implement the actual quantum search algorithm one needs a quantum mechanical system where one can carry out certain elementary quantum mechanical operations in a controlled way ,",
    "it is _ not _ possible to implement the algorithm on classical hardware . yet , in this paper we show that a very similar algorithm works in a classical system .",
    "the difference is that in a classical system the hardware required is proportional to @xmath0 whereas in the quantum system , the hardware is only proportional to @xmath4    the algorithm of this paper is of interest , both in its own right as a classical algorithm and also for the insight it provides into quantum computing .",
    "for example , it is well established that the quantum search algorithm , which can search @xmath0  possibilities in only @xmath1 steps , is the best possible algorithm for exhaustive searching .",
    "yet there is no simple argument as to why this is the best algorithm or why the algorithm should need @xmath1 steps .",
    "this paper gives an elementary argument as to why it needs @xmath1 cycles to identify the different pendulum .",
    "any quantum mechanical transformation is a rotation of the state - vector in @xmath5  dimensional complex hilbert space ( @xmath0 is the number of states ) .",
    "therefore any quantum mechanical algorithm too , is a rotation of the state - vector in @xmath0  dimensional complex hilbert space .",
    "the quantum search algorithm @xcite is a special case since it is a rotation in a carefully defined two dimensional vector space .",
    "this fact was first noticed by farhi and gutmann who used it to develop the following variant of the search algorithm @xcite .",
    "consider an @xmath0  state system , whose hamiltonian is known to be @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is known to be a basis state , the problem is to find out which one this is .",
    "we are allowed to add on any additional term to the hamiltonian ( provided this does not depend on @xmath7 ) and let the system evolve in any way we choose .",
    "the question is as to how rapidly can we identify @xmath7 ?    any obvious technique will need @xmath8 time .",
    "for example , if we examine each state separately by coupling it to an auxiliary state , it will take @xmath9 time to examine each state and thus @xmath8 time in all . however , by using an analogy with the quantum search algorithm , it is possible to devise a scheme to identify @xmath7 that requires only @xmath10 time .",
    "the idea is to first add an additional term of @xmath11 to the given hamiltonian . then start the system from the superposition @xmath12 ,",
    "let it evolve for a time @xmath10 and finally carry out an observation . in the following two paragraphs",
    "we show that with a high probability the state observed will be @xmath13 .",
    "this technique is similar to the search algorithm in that it consists of a rotation of the state vector in a two - dimensional vector space defined by @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    to simplify notation ,",
    "assume that @xmath7 is the first of the @xmath14states , i.e. @xmath15 . the total hamiltonian then becomes :    @xmath16    writing this in the subspace spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and leaving out terms of order @xmath19 , the above hamiltonian becomes : @xmath20thus the quantum dynamics of the system is essentially that of two _ degenerate _ levels with mixing amplitude of @xmath21 .",
    "the initial state @xmath22 `` rotates '' to @xmath17 in a time inversely related to the mixing matrix element .",
    "since this element is @xmath21 , the time taken by this search algorithm is @xmath10 .",
    "the discrete quantum search algorithm is very similar .",
    "the main difference is that instead of having the hamiltonian be constant throughout , it is adjusted so that the item specific portion acts separately from the mixing portion , i.e. there are alternate steps of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this perspective is described in @xcite .",
    "thus , at the heart of the search algorithm , is a resonance phenomenon . in the following sections we discuss a classical analogue of the same phenomenon involving coupled oscillators .",
    "variants of the quantum search algorithm have previously been proposed with classical waves @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we present the algorithm in a conceptually different way as a resonance phenomenon . using this interpretation ,",
    "it can be implemented in a way that is very different from the original search algorithm .",
    "the analysis and results of the following two sections hold for any system of classical oscillators , either mechanical or electrical .",
    "however , for concreteness we consider the oscillators to be pendulums .",
    "consider the following problem .",
    "we are given @xmath0  pendulums - one of which is slightly shorter than the rest .",
    "the problem is to identify which one this is .",
    "we could measure the frequency of each one of these separately and thus identify the shorter one .",
    "this would take @xmath8  cycles . instead ,",
    "in the next section , we show that by carefully coupling them together and letting them oscillate for @xmath10 cycles , a substantial portion of the energy can be transferred to the shorter pendulum whose amplitude becomes very high .",
    "this is accomplished by a resonance phenomenon very similar to that in quantum search . using this",
    "it is possible to identify the different pendulum as briefly described in section 5 .",
    "we show that by suspending the @xmath0  pendulums from a bigger pendulum ( figure 1 ) and adjusting the masses and lengths of the bigger pendulum appropriately , it is possible to achieve a coupling similar to that of the @xmath5  states in the quantum search algorithm ( section 2 ) . as in section 2 ,",
    "let us make the first pendulum special while the rest of the @xmath25 of them are identical .",
    "figure 1 - _ n _ *  pendulums are suspended from a single pendulum .",
    "*    the lagrangian of the system of figure 1 is given by @xmath26;\\,\\;k\\equiv ( m+\\frac{m}{n})\\frac{g}{l},k_{j}\\equiv m_{j}\\frac{g}{l_{j } }   \\label{lagrangian}\\]]where @xmath27 is the displacement of the support pendulum , @xmath28 is the displacement of the @xmath29 pendulum hanging from the support ; @xmath30 are the mass and the length of the support pendulum , @xmath31 are the mass and length of the first pendulum and @xmath32 are the mass and the length of each of the other pendulums ( @xmath33 is the acceleration due to gravity ) .",
    "it was probably simpler to keep the lagrangian of ( lagrangian ) in terms of the @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 however , as mentioned before , the framework of this paper applies to any system of oscillators , electrical or mechanical . in order to be able to quickly translate the results to other applications",
    ", we express the lagrangian in ( [ lagrangian ] ) in a more general notation in terms of the stiffnesses ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "now we change variables so that we consider the center of mass mode @xmath38 of pendulums @xmath39 , and other modes of excitation of the same pendulums orthogonal to the center of mass mode which we denote by :  @xmath40 @xmath41 . in terms of these variables ,",
    "the lagrangian may be written as : @xmath42 . \\label{transformed}\\]]note",
    "that the @xmath43 s decouple from the rest of the variables .",
    "if we consider an initial condition where each @xmath43 is zero , they will stay zero .",
    "hence we can omit these variables and concentrate on the three crucial ones : @xmath44 .",
    "defining @xmath45 , and ignoring some irrelevant @xmath46 terms , the reduced lagrangian ( without the @xmath43 s ) may be written as : @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{l_red}\\]]@xmath48    the lagrangian , @xmath49 represents two strongly coupled degrees of freedom , namely @xmath27 and @xmath38 , and a variable @xmath50 , that is weakly coupled to others .",
    "we can first solve the @xmath51 system .",
    "this will give rise to two modes with frequencies which we denote by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the natural frequency of the @xmath50 degree of freedom that corresponds to the special pendulum is @xmath54 ( ignoring the @xmath55 coupling @xmath50 has with the other modes ) .",
    "if @xmath56 is arranged to be very close to either @xmath52 or @xmath53 , we will have a resonant transfer of energy between the two weakly coupled systems .",
    "the number of cycles required for significant transfer of energy to the special pendulum varies inversely with the coupling and will be @xmath10.cycles irrespective of the deviation .",
    "the reason for this becomes clear by examining the frequency diagram of figure 2 when the deviation between @xmath56 and @xmath57  becomes zero .",
    "then whatever value we choose for @xmath58 , will result in an order 1 difference between @xmath56 and @xmath59 i.e. we will never be able to satisfy the resonance condition . ]",
    "figure 2 - * the center of mass mode ( * @xmath60 *  and the coupling mode ( * @xmath61 *  interact to produce two new modes ( * @xmath62 @xmath63 * , one of these ( * @xmath64 * is resonantly coupled to the oscillation mode of the different pendulum ( * @xmath56 * ) with an * @xmath21 *  coupling*.    we next analyze the three - mode system defined by the reduced lagrangian ( l_red ) by writing its equations of motion . the equations of motion can be written in matrix form as follows : @xmath65    where the displacement vector @xmath66 , the mass matrix @xmath67 and the stiffness matrix @xmath68 are defined as follows:@xmath69 ,  @xmath70 , @xmath71    solving ( [ mx_dot_dot ] ) by assuming a solution where the time dependence of each component of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 .",
    "it follows after some straightforward analysis that @xmath74 is given by the eigenvalues of the following matrix , @xmath75 : @xmath76    here @xmath77 ( @xmath58 corresponds to the frequency of the _ coupling _ degree of freedom , i.e. the frequency of the large pendulum ) , @xmath78 ( @xmath79  is the frequency of the center of mass mode ) , @xmath80(@xmath56  is the frequency of the deviating pendulum ) , @xmath81(@xmath82 is the coupling between the large pendulum and the center of mass mode ) .    inspecting the matrix @xmath75",
    "makes it clear that the first two modes are strongly coupled , whereas the first mode is only weakly coupled to the third mode by a term of order@xmath83 .",
    "we can thus change basis so that the @xmath84 block is diagonalized .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are given by the eigenvalues of the @xmath84 block : @xmath85 .\\]]in the rotated basis , each of the first two modes will have @xmath55 coupling with the third mode , the matrix @xmath75 gets transformed into a matrix @xmath86 of the following form :    @xmath87    we start this system by giving a push to the large support pendulum , delivering order 1 energy .",
    "this energy will first be in the ( @xmath88 subsystem .",
    "however , under the condition of resonance , in @xmath10 cycles , the special pendulum will swing with an amplitude of order 1 .",
    "all the other @xmath89 identical pendulums would move in lock step ; their total energy would be order 1 , but individual pendulums will have energy of @xmath90 , and their amplitudes would be @xmath55 .",
    "it must be noted that precise information about the different item is required in order to satisfy the resonance condition - we would have to know precisely how much longer or shorter this pendulum was as compared to the remaining pendulums .",
    "this would determine the value of @xmath91  and @xmath92 ( the mass and length of the support pendulum from which the rest of the pendulums are suspended ) .",
    "as described above , we have a means for transferring a large portion of the energy from the support pendulum into an aberrant pendulum , assuming we have precise information about the length of this pendulum but do not know which this is .",
    "this procedure can be used to identify which pendulum this is ( as in the quantum search algorithm ) . in order to better define the problem , it is important to list some of the associated constraints .      1 .",
    "the system is started by giving a single push to the support pendulum .",
    "2 .   we can redesign parameters and observe the motion of a constant number of pendulums .",
    "observations can only be resolved with a finite precision that is independent of @xmath93    these constraints are meant to reflect realistic limitations on the system .",
    "also , these constraints are what make the problem interesting . for example , if we could observe the system with arbitrary precision , then we could deduce the presence of the short pendulum by observing the motion of any pendulum in a constant number of cycles , even without any resonance . however , this demands a precision of @xmath90 .",
    "the following procedure ascertains whether or not there is a special pendulum in the set that is connected to the support pendulum .",
    "once we have a procedure for identifying the presence ( or absence ) of a desired item in a specified set , it is possible to identify precisely which one this .",
    "this is a standard technique in computer science and is accomplished by @xmath3 repetitions of the identification procedure in a binary search fashion .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",

    "if it did not originally have a short pendulum , then it will have just one short pendulum .",
    "an analysis similar to the previous section shows that the resonant coupling transfers a large fraction of the energy to and from the short pendulums with a periodicity of @xmath94 cycles , where @xmath95 is the number of short pendulums .",
    "thus there will be a difference of a factor of @xmath96 in the periodicity , depending on whether there are 1 or 2 short pendulums .",
    "this periodicity is inferred from the variations in amplitude in step ( 3 ) .",
    "the quantum search algorithm has been rigorously proved to be the best possible algorithm for exhaustive search , i.e. no other algorithm can carry out an exhaustive search of @xmath0  items in fewer than @xmath10 steps .",
    "the proof for this is complicated and based on subtle properties of unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in the classical analog , there is a simple argument as to why it needs @xmath10 cycles to transfer the energy to the desired pendulum .    as described in section 4 , the oscillation mode of the single pendulum",
    "is resonantly coupled to one of the two modes arising out of interaction of the center of mass mode ( which has a mass @xmath8  times that of the single pendulum ) with the mode of the coupling pendulum ( which too has a mass @xmath8  times that of the single pendulum ) .",
    "therefore the modes that arise out of this interaction also behave as oscillators with a mass @xmath8  times that of the single pendulum .",
    "the question is as to how rapidly can we transfer energy from a pendulum of mass @xmath8  to that of a pendulum with a mass of order 1 through a resonant coupling .",
    "assume both pendulums to have an energy of order 1 .",
    "then the amplitude of the larger pendulum is @xmath21 times that of the smaller pendulum .",
    "since they have the same frequencies , the peak velocity of the larger pendulum is also @xmath21 times that of the smaller pendulum .",
    "consider an elastic collision between a sphere of mass of @xmath0 , traveling with a velocity of @xmath98 with another sphere of unit mass traveling with a velocity less than 1 .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , in the center of mass frame , the larger sphere is almost stationary and the smaller sphere bounces off the larger sphere .",
    "the speed of the smaller sphere stays unaltered and the velocity changes sign ( in order to conserve kinetic energy ) .",
    "translating back to the original frame , we see that the magnitude of the velocity of the smaller sphere has increased by @xmath99 therefore it will take @xmath10 such collisions for the velocity of the smaller sphere to be made to rise from 0 to 1 ( or equivalently to transfer an energy of order 1 ) .",
    "the resonant coupling repeatedly brings back the small sphere to interact with the larger sphere thus arranging the necessary interactions which produce the same effects on the velocity as the collisions .",
    "figure 3 - * when a sphere of unit mass moving with unit velocity collides with a larger sphere of mass equal to * @xmath100 *  that is moving with a velocity of * @xmath101 *  the magnitude of the velocity of the smaller sphere can change by at most * @xmath99",
    "estimating the number of occurrences is an important problem in statistics and computer science .",
    "one of the first extensions of the original quantum search algorithm was to the problem of counting where too it gave a square - root advantage over the best possible classical algorithm brassard .",
    "as might be anticipated , our classical analog too gives a square - root advantage over the standard estimation technique .",
    "we are given @xmath0 pendulums , a small fraction of them ( say @xmath102 ) are shorter than the rest .",
    "the problem is to estimate @xmath103 the standard sampling technique is to pick a certain number of pendulums at random and measure their oscillation frequency .",
    "since the probability of getting a shorter pendulum in each sample is @xmath104 it will take about @xmath105 samples before we get a single occurrence of a shorter pendulum .",
    "since it takes @xmath106cycles to estimate the oscillation frequency of a pendulum , it will take @xmath107 cycles to be able to derive any reasonable estimate of @xmath102 . on the other hand , by extending the technique of the previous section , it is possible to estimate @xmath102 in only @xmath108 cycles .",
    "the approach is to suspend all @xmath0 pendulums from a single pendulum as in section 4 thus coupling them .",
    "now , as before , a resonant coupling is designed between the shorter pendulums and the rest of the system .",
    "the strength of this coupling is @xmath109 .",
    "this causes energy to flow back and forth from the shorter pendulums with a periodicity of @xmath108 cycles . as in section ( ) , we design the first pendulum to be a short pendulum . by following its amplitude for @xmath108 cycles , we will observe a cyclic variation .",
    "the length of this cycle will immediately identify @xmath103      consider an application where we need to transfer energy to one of @xmath0 subsystems .",
    "this can be accomplished by coupling the subsystems as described in this paper and making a slight perturbation to the subsystem into which we want the energy to flow into .",
    "after @xmath10 cycles , a large fraction of the energy will flow into the selected subsystem .",
    "alternatively , if we want to transfer energy from one subsystem to another , this can be similarly accomplished by a two - step process .",
    "first , make a perturbation to the subsystem from which the energy is coming . if the system is now allowed to oscillate for @xmath10 cycles , the energy transfers into the support pendulum .",
    "now , if the perturbation is removed from the source pendulum and made in the destination pendulum , the energy will flow from the support into the destination pendulum . by proper design it is possible to accomplish a lossless transfer of energy from one to another pendulum .",
    "this type of scheme would be especially useful in an application where we need the flexibility of transferring energy to any one of @xmath0 components with minimal changes in hardware : a mechanical router .      in quantum mechanical settings",
    "there are several applications where various modes of oscillation are coupled through the _ center of mass mode_. for example , consider @xmath0 atoms coupled resonantly to a photon mode in an optical cavity @xcite . the atoms  are trapped in the cavity by some kind of electromagnetic fields .",
    "the photon mode plays the role of the support pendulum through which the particles are coupled .",
    "consider the basis state @xmath110 to be the state where the photon excitation is localized on the @xmath111 atom .",
    "due to the coupling there is a certain amplitude for the excitation to transfer to another atom .",
    "since the atoms are close together in the cavity this amplitude is the same between any two atoms .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian is of the form : @xmath112 @xmath113this is exactly the kind of hamiltonian that motivated our analysis ( section 2 ) .",
    "a similar analysis applies in the case of an ion - trap @xcite or in the case of josephson junctions @xcite coupled through a mutual inductance .",
    "our approach would carry over to the situations described above .",
    "an important problem in an ion - trap is to transfer excitations from one ion to another .",
    "this is the quantum analog of the problem of section 7.2 .",
    "it needs further research to decide the pros and cons of our method as compared to the cirac - zoller method @xcite ."
