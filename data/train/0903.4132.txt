    "semantic memory is a distinct part of the declarative memory system @xcite comprising knowledge of facts , vocabulary , and concepts acquired through everyday life @xcite .",
    "contrary to episodic memory , which stores life experiences , semantic memory is not linked to any particular time or place . in a more restricted definition , it is responsible for the storage of semantic categories and naming of natural and artificial concepts @xcite",
    ". it is known that this memory involves distinct brain regions and its impairment in neurodegenerative diseases such as fronto - temporal dementia @xcite , multiple sclerosis @xcite and alzheimer s disease @xcite produce verbal fluency deficits .",
    "for this reason , lexical access , the cognitive information - retrieval process in charge of retrieving concepts , has been widely explored through semantic verbal fluency tasks in the context of neuropsychological evaluation @xcite .",
    "these tests require the generation of words corresponding to a specific semantic category , typically animals , fruits or tools , for a given time .",
    "although the task is easy to explain , it actually results in a complex challenge where retrieving as many concepts as possible in a limited time depends more on cognitive mechanisms than on the knowledge itself . according to the two - component model proposed by a. troyer @xcite ,",
    "optimal fluency performance involves a balance between two different processes : ` clustering ' , or generating words within a subcategory , and , when a subcategory is exhausted , ` switching ' to a new subcategory . in the case of naming animals ,",
    "clustering produces semantically related transitions ( e.g. _ lion - tiger _ ) and switching is a mechanism that allows to jump or shift to different semantic fields ( e.g. _ tiger - shark _ ) .",
    "while the former is attached to the temporal lobe of the brain , the latter has been associated to a frontal lobe activity @xcite .",
    "evidences of the interaction between these two regions of the brain during language related tasks has led a number of studies to refer to a _ fronto - temporal modulation _ or interaction @xcite .    in this paper , the cognitive paradigm that consists of retrieving words from a _ semantic network _",
    "@xcite was generalized to an exploration task on a network .",
    "clustering was modeled as a random - walker constrained to the topology of the network and switching as an extra - topological mechanism that is able to move from any node to any node ( see figure [ figsrwexample ] ) .",
    "the combination of these two processes gave rise to a dual mechanism denoted here as _ switcher - random - walker _",
    "( srw ) , i.e. a random - walker with the additional ability of switching .",
    "the combination of switching and clustering , i.e. , free jumping and random walking , was ruled by a parameter @xmath0 , which is the probability of switching at every step , and thus is the parameter that metaphorically rules the fronto - temporal modulation .",
    "therefore the complementary @xmath1 is the probability of clustering at every step , and can be interpreted as the strength of the _ local perseverance _ of the exploration before moving somewhere else within the network ( specially for those networks with either high clustering coefficient or high modularity ) .",
    "this cognitive inspired paradigm gives rise to the following question : how does switching and its modulation affect random exploration of different network models ?",
    "search , propagation and transport phenomena have been studied in networks @xcite , where it is crucial to define whether the full topology is known .",
    "when it is known , the ease to reach any node from any node is measured by the _ shortest path length _ @xcite . when it remains unknown ,",
    "exploration is modeled by random walks along the network @xcite .",
    "this is the case of retrieving concepts since the subject is not aware of his full semantic network when naming them . in this kind of cases reachability of nodes",
    "is measured with the _",
    "mean first passage time _ ( mfpt ) ,",
    "i.e. the averaged number of steps needed to visit a node @xmath2 for the first time , starting from a node @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". given its relevance in complex media , this paradigm has been recently revisited in a number of studies @xcite .    while different derivations of random - walkers have been recently used to infer the underlying topological properties of complex networks @xcite , our aim was to evaluate how srw ( and in particular , the effect of different levels of switching ) contributes to the exploration of network models with well known topological properties .",
    "different models which were not necessarily lexico - conceptual architectures were explored by a srw and its performance was measured by the mfpt ( detailed in section [ srwmarkov ] ) .",
    "going back to the cognitive paradigm , retrieving plenty of words in a semantic verbal fluency test not only depends on the number of concepts that the subject knows , but also on an equilibrium between the underlying semantic topology that organizes those concepts and the frequency of switching @xcite . for example , two different studies @xcite reported that their respective groups of healthy participants produced @xmath4 and @xmath5 animals during @xmath6 seconds .",
    "there are two remarkable aspects in these figures .",
    "first , participants obviously knew many more animals than those said and , second , there is a high heterogeneity in the number of words .",
    "hence , even though all participants only named a low fraction of the animals they knew , some of them had much more success than others when retrieving them .",
    "as introduced in the previous section , our approach for a clustering step consists of a walker unaware of the full network moving from one node to any of its neighbors with no preferential gradients among neighbors .",
    "such exploration task was modeled by the well known _ random - walker _ ( rw ) .",
    "switching was implemented as a mechanism where the walker moves to any other node following different probabilistic approaches .",
    "summarizing srw can be defined as a random- walker with the capability of rendering random shifts .",
    "a finite markov chain is a special type of stochastic process which can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath7 be a finite set whose members are the _ states _ of the system , which we label @xmath8 .",
    "the process moves through these states in a sequence of _",
    "steps_. if at any time it is in state @xmath3 , it moves to a state @xmath2 on the next step with some probability , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the set of @xmath11 matrices of non - negative entries where the sum of every row is 1 .",
    "these probabilities define a square , @xmath12 matrix , @xmath13 : @xmath14,\\ ] ] which we call the _ matrix of transition probabilities_. the importance of matrix theory to markov chains comes from the fact that the @xmath15th entry of the @xmath16th power of @xmath13 , @xmath17 $ ] represents the probability that the process will be in state @xmath2 after @xmath16 steps considering that it was started in state @xmath3 .",
    "the study of a general markov chain can be reduced to the study of two special types of chains . these are _ absorbing chains _ and _ ergodic chains _",
    "( also known as _ irreducible _ ) .",
    "the former contain at least one absorbing state , i.e. a state constituted by a proper subset of the whole by which , once entered it can not be left , and furthermore , which is reachable from every state in a finite number of steps .",
    "the latter are those chains where is possible to go from any state to any other state in a finite number of steps and are called _ regular _ chains when @xmath18 for regular chains , the @xmath15th entry of @xmath19 becomes essentially independent of state @xmath3 as @xmath16 is larger . in the case of regular chains , we can define a stationary probability matrix @xcite @xmath20 as : @xmath21    note that for non regular markov processes this limit might not exist . for instance @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 consists of a row probability vector @xmath23 which is repeated on each row .",
    "this vector @xmath23 can be obtained as the only probability vector satisfying @xmath24 @xcite . for the case of regular markov processes obtained from random walks on graphs , this indicates that in the long run , the probability to be in a node is independent of the node where the process started .",
    "this section is devoted to the characterization of the underlying object over which we apply our algorithm of exploration , a graph . beyond its main features ,",
    "we discuss the consequences of connectedness in order to clearly define the frameworks over which the srw algorithm can be defined .",
    "finally , we briefly define the graph models studied numerically in section [ results ] .",
    "let us suppose that our markov chain is defined by some graph topology .",
    "a graph @xmath25 is defined by a set of nodes , @xmath26 , and a set of links @xmath27 , being @xmath28 a subset of @xmath29 . in our approach ,",
    "the graph is undirected and we avoid the possibility that a node contains auto - loops or that two links are connecting the same nodes .",
    "the _ size _ of the graph is @xmath30 , i.e. the cardinal of the set of vertices .",
    "its _ average connectivity _ is defined as : @xmath31 the topology of our graph is completely described by a symmetrical , @xmath32 matrix , @xmath33 $ ] , the so - called _ adjacency matrix _ , whose elements are defined as : @xmath34 the connectivity of the node @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the number of links departing from @xmath35 and it can be easily computed from the adjacency matrix as : @xmath37 following the characterization , we now define the degree distribution , which is understood as the probability that a randomly chosen node displays a given connectivity . in this way",
    ", we define the elements of such a probability distribution , @xmath38 as : @xmath39    the above defined measures are the _ identity card _ of a given graph @xmath40 .",
    "one could think that it is enough because our main goal is to describe and characterize an exploration algorithm over @xmath40 .",
    "however , specially in the models of random graphs , we can not be directly sure that our adjacency matrix defines a fully connected graph , i.e , that there exists , with probability @xmath41 a path from any node @xmath35 to any node @xmath42 . in deterministic graphs",
    ", we can solve this problem by assuming , a priori , that our combinatorial object is fully connected .",
    "furthermore , we could agree that , when performing rewirings at random , we impose the condition of connectedness .",
    "the case of pure random graphs is a bit more complicated .",
    "indeed , a random graph is obtained by a stochastic process of addition or removal of links @xcite .",
    "thus , we need a criteria to ensure that our graph is connected or , at least , to work over the most representative component of the obtained object .",
    "full connectedness is hard to ensure in a pure random graph .",
    "instead , what we can find is a _ giant connected component _ , @xmath43 .",
    "informally speaking , we can imagine an algorithm spreading at random links among a set of predefined nodes , the so - called erds - rnyi graph process .",
    "the growing graph displays , at the beginning , a myriad of small clusters of a few nodes and , when we overcome some threshold in the number of links we spread at random , a component much bigger than the others emerges , i.e. the @xmath43 @xcite . in this way",
    ", m. molloy and b. reed @xcite demonstrated that , given a random graph with degree distribution @xmath38 , if @xmath44 then , there exists , with high probability , a giant connected component .",
    "the first condition we need to assume is thus , that the studied graphs satisfy inequality ( [ eqmolloy1995 ] ) . beyond this assumption",
    ", we impose the following criteria when studying our model networks :    1 .   in a deterministic graph ( for example , a chain or a lattice ) where we perform random re - wirings , we do not allow re - wirings that break the graph .",
    "if a graph is the result of an stochastic process , the exploration algorithm is defined only over the @xmath43 ( this could imply the whole set of nodes ) .",
    "the adjacency matrix is the adjacency matrix of the @xmath43 .",
    "remove _ the nodes that , in the beginning , participated in the process of construction of @xmath40 but fell outside the @xmath43 .",
    "all the model graphs studied in this work satisfy the above conditions .    in order to enable useful comparative analysis",
    ", we built different networks , all of them with @xmath45 nodes and @xmath46 links .",
    "the results were averaged after @xmath47 instances per network model .",
    "let us briefly define the models we will study with our exploration algorithm .",
    "* watts - strogatz small - world network*. we built an annulus with @xmath48 nodes in such a way that every node is connected to @xmath49 different nodes ( 2000 undirected links ) @xcite .",
    "once the annulus was constructed , every link suffered a random re - wiring with connectivity @xmath50 .",
    "* erds rnyi graph*. over a set fo @xmath48 nodes we spread at random @xmath51 links , avoiding duplication and self - interaction .",
    "it can be shown that the obtained graph displayed a binomial degree distribution @xcite : @xmath52 being @xmath53 the probability of two nodes being connected .",
    "its value corresponds to @xmath54    * random - modular*. we built @xmath55 different components of @xmath56 nodes and @xmath57 links , spread at random ( as explained for erds rnyi graphs ) among the @xmath56 nodes of every component . in this case",
    ", we ensure connectedness of such components .",
    "once the ten components are constructed , every link suffers a random rewiring with a node either from the same component or not , with probability @xmath50 .    * preferential attachment*.",
    "we provide a seed of @xmath58 connected nodes .",
    "every new node was connected to @xmath49 of the existing nodes with probability proportional to the connectivity of the existing nodes , i.e. , suppose that , at time @xmath59 a new node @xmath35 comes in to the graph . at this time step , the graph will display an adjacency matrix @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 this operation is repeated in an iterative fashion ( i.e. , updating @xmath63 ) @xmath49 times per node .",
    "it can be shown that , at the limit of a large number of nodes the outcome of this algorithm generates a graph whose degree distribution is a power law @xcite : @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth noting that such an algorithm avoids the possibility of unconnected components .      in this framework ,",
    "the transition from node @xmath3 to @xmath2 is just the probability that a random - walker starts from some node @xmath3 and reaches the node @xmath2 , after some steps .",
    "consistently , the probability that being in @xmath35 we reach the node @xmath42 in a single step ( i.e , @xmath66 ) is : @xmath67 this is the general form for a markov formalization of a random - walker within a graph defined by its adjacency matrix @xmath63 . throughout this work",
    "we assume that our graphs define _ regular _ markov processes ( see section [ markovchains ] ) . under the above definition of @xmath13 , regularity is assured if and only if the graph is not bipartite ( i.e. , it contains , at least , one loop containing an odd number of nodes ) . to see that bipartite graphs are not regular",
    ", it is enough to notice that for any pair of nodes @xmath68 there are only either odd or even paths joining them , but not both .",
    "hence if @xmath69 then @xmath70 and therefore the process can not be regular . summarizing , despite that connectedness ensures that the process is ergodic , @xmath71 it does not ensure regularity and therefore the @xmath72 might not exist .",
    "the existence of an odd loop breaks such parity problem and enables @xmath19 to stabilize to a specific matrix of stationary probabilities when @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we must impose another assumption to our studied graphs : our algorithm works over non - bipartite graphs which satisfy the criteria imposed in section ii b. it is straightforward to observe that , if the assumption of regularity holds , the above markov process has a stationary state with associated probabilities proportional to the connectivity of the studied node @xcite : @xmath74 from now on , we will refer to the transition matrix above defined as @xmath75 , since it denotes the probabilities of the movements related to clustering .      in the retrieval model introduced here ,",
    "the matrix of transition probabilities @xmath76 is a linear combination of the switching transition probabilities @xmath77 and the clustering transition probabilities @xmath75 , as defined in the above section .",
    "the _ markov process _ is a switcher - random - walker and the _ states _ represent the location of such walker in the network .",
    "the matrix @xmath78 $ ] is ergodic and regular since all entries are strictly greater than zero , and has equal rows , i.e. constant columns .",
    "the reason is that the probability of reaching a node @xmath2 through switching is independent of the source node @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", we could consider that we define a scalar field @xmath79 over the nodes of the graph : @xmath80 consistently , @xmath81 we can define this field in many different ways . as the more representative",
    ", we revise several scalar fields that can provide us interesting information about the process : @xmath82 in the first and most simple case switching to any other node is a random uniform process , and we refer to this process as _ uniformly distributed switching_. the second case corresponds to the situation where the probability to reach a given node through switching is proportional to its connectivity , which we call _ positive degree gradient switching .",
    "the last one assumes that @xmath83 is @xmath84 and corresponds to the situation where the switcher jumps with more probability to weakly connected nodes , and we refer to it as _ negative degree gradient switching_. these three variants of switching were studied when combined with a random - walker within the above graph topologies ( see fig.([figmfptmosaic ] ) ) .",
    "they were denoted by @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath88 $ ] defined in the above section is ergodic and regular but restricted to the transitions allowed by the adjacency matrix @xmath63 of the network of study .",
    "we modeled as equi - probable the transitions among linked nodes of the network .",
    "hence the probability of moving from a node @xmath35 to a a node @xmath42 through clustering for a given graph @xmath40 with an adjacency matrix @xmath89 $ ] , is    @xmath90    thus , @xmath91 $ ] is defined as : @xmath92 where @xmath0 is the probability of switching .",
    "consistently , the entries of @xmath76 are given by : @xmath93    we observed that @xmath76 is also ergodic and regular .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath77 has already all entries strictly greater than zero , and thus @xmath76 will have all entries greater than zero for any @xmath94 .",
    "for the case of @xmath95 , @xmath76 is just @xmath75 which we assumed to be regular .    among other interesting descriptive random variables that can be evaluated for regular chains ,",
    "the matrix of the _ mean first passage time _ ( mfpt ) is a matrix @xmath96 $ ] , crucial for measuring the retrieval or exploratory performance of any stochastic strategy ; the mfpt needed to go from a node @xmath3 to a node @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath97 @xcite and represents the time ( in step units ) required to reach state @xmath2 for the first time starting from state @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath98 is not necessarily equal to @xmath99 , i.e. it might happen that the time required to go from state @xmath3 to state @xmath2 is different to the time required to go from state @xmath2 to state @xmath3 .    in order to obtain the analytical expression of mfpt , we must define first a fundamental matrix @xmath100 @xcite which is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the identity matrix of size @xmath32 .        in this case",
    "the entry @xmath104 of @xmath100 can be understood as a measure of the deviations of the @xmath15th entry of @xmath105 from their limiting probabilities @xmath23 , which , as commented in section [ markovchains ] , is any of the equal rows of @xmath106 . from @xmath100 and @xmath23",
    "we can obtain the analytical derivation of @xmath107 $ ] ( for more details see @xcite ) :    @xmath108    finally , we denote as @xmath109 the averaged value of all entries @xmath98 for a switcher random walker exploring a network @xmath40 . since @xmath110 it is not necessarily symmetrical , we must take into account all the entries outside the main diagonal .",
    "the main diagonal was not taken into account , since it represents the returning time , which we do not consider as a part of the exploration of the net .",
    "thus , @xmath111 this measure provides a general evaluation of how reachable is , on average , any node from any other node in a specific network using a switcher random - walker .",
    "it is interesting to notice that such measure has an upper bound which is precisely the size of the net .",
    "indeed , let us suppose we have a clique of size @xmath112 , i.e. , a graph , @xmath113 , where @xmath30 equals @xmath112 and every node @xmath35 is connected to itself and to all @xmath114 remaining nodes .",
    "it corresponds to the case where the probability of switching is @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath115 be a random variable whose outcomes are @xmath42 such that , @xmath116 : @xmath117 we define a stochastic process , namely , the realizations of @xmath115 through different time steps , @xmath118 let us define another random variable , @xmath119 , namely the number of realizations of @xmath115 needed to ensure that there has been one realization of @xmath115 equal to @xmath42 : @xmath120 clearly , and due to the symmetry of our experiment , all the nodes behave in the same way .",
    "furthermore , @xmath121 i.e. , we need , in average @xmath112 realizations of @xmath115 in order to obtain , at least , one realization @xmath122 , @xmath116 .",
    "we observe that the above random experiment is exactly a random switching over a graph containing @xmath112 nodes , and that @xmath123 is the @xmath124 of this process .",
    "let us suppose we have a @xmath125 .",
    "this implies that , in average @xmath126 which is a contradiction , since the graph has @xmath112 nodes .",
    "thus , for a given graph @xmath127 : @xmath128 this value represents an horizontal asymptote in the model of srw as @xmath0 increases , and it is clearly defined in our model experiments ( see figure [ figmfptmosaic ] ) .",
    "our main result was that srw exploration , a cognitive inspired strategy that combines random - walking with switching for random exploration of networks , decreased the @xmath129 of all models for all srw variants .",
    "this means that , on average , the number of steps needed to travel between every pair of nodes decreases and thus the overall exploration abilities of a srw within the networks improves respect to rw .    regarding @xmath130 ( fig .",
    "[ figmfptmosaic]a ) , exploration performance of random - modular and small - world networks severely improves , overtaking scale - free at @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath132 all the networks but scale - free converged , leading to a remarkable scenario where modularity and high clustering coefficients are not topological handicaps for an efficient information retrieval .",
    "switching in @xmath133 severely improves @xmath129 in modular and small - world networks while hardly decreases it in scale - free and random .",
    "the reason is that a random - walker on both kind of networks already shows a gradient to visit highly connected nodes @xcite , and a positive - degree switching supported rather than compensated this effect due to redundancy on hubs [ figmfptmosaic]b ) .    in @xmath134 ,",
    "intermediate values of q ( around @xmath135 for all but scale - free models ) showed optimal performance with a similar effect to the one produced by @xmath130 .",
    "however , it only partially succeeded in compensating the already commented natural rw gradient for hubs .",
    "[ figmfptmosaic]c ) .",
    "interestingly , those @xmath0 values close to @xmath41 produced an inverse situation where hubs are so unlikely to be reached that the overall exploration performance decreased for all the models but dramatically for scale - free model , where the degree heterogeneity is specially high .",
    "on the contrary , small - world model showed a very similar performance when explored by any of the three srw variants .",
    "the reason is that in this model , the degree distribution is very homogeneous , and thus different degree gradients of switching produced very little differences .",
    "the approximate convergence of the exploration efficiency ( for most of the topologies when using @xmath85 or @xmath87 with a moderate switching rate ) allows a system to organize information or to evolve without compromising exploration and retrieval efficiency . in this sense",
    ", semantic memory might be organizing information in a strongly modular or locally clustered way without compromising retrieval performance of concepts . in a more general perspective",
    ", the addition of a switching mechanism and its interaction with random - walker dynamics opens a new framework to understand processes related to information storage and retrieval . indeed , switching not only mitigates exploration deficits of certain network topologies but",
    "also might provide certain robustness to the system .",
    "for instance , the rewired links ( known as short - cuts ) in both small - world and random - modular models are contributing to facilitate access to different regions of the network .",
    "those short - cuts might compensate a switching impairment or dysfunction and vice versa , i.e. switching would ensure an accurate exploration of the network even though a targeted attack removed those short - cuts permanently .",
    "similar mechanisms to switching have been observed in the context of information networks . in particular , the iterative algorithm _ pagerank _ estimates a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page for a hyper - linked set of documents ( e.g. the world - wide - web ) @xcite .",
    "the user is supposed to be a _",
    "random - surfer _ who begins at a random web page and keeps clicking on links but never hitting back .",
    "the _ damping - factor _ is an additional item that includes the fact that the user can get bored and start on another random page .",
    "the combination of these two processes is used by the google internet search engine to estimate the relevance of different links ( pagerank values ) .",
    "interestingly , while the objective ( rank link targets ) and the framework ( hyper - linked documents , i.e. directed graphs ) are not the same , the cognitive - inspired srw described here and pagerank algorithm combine random - walks restricted to a topology with an extra - topological mechanism in order to evaluate tasks in complex networks .",
    "the model proposed here could have implications in other systems that usually have a conflict between organization and retrieval or spreading efficiency .",
