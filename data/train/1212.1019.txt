    "it is clear that the face - to - face tiling for a given parallelohedron @xmath1 is unique up to a translation .",

    "h.  minkowski @xcite proved that every parallelohedron @xmath1 is centrally symmetric , all facets of @xmath1 are centrally symmetric , and projection of @xmath1 along any its faces of codimension @xmath6 is two - dimensional parallelohedron , i.e. parallelogram or centrally symmetric hexagon . later venkov @xcite proved that these three conditions are sufficient for convex poytope to be a parallelohedron .",

    "we will consider all three cases of possible dual 3-cells of @xmath15",
    ".    denote the cycle arond @xmath15 on the surface of @xmath1 as @xmath61 .",
    "first , assume that dual 3-cell of @xmath15 is a tetrahedron @xmath95 with vertices correspondent to parallelohedra @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "denote centers of these polytopes as @xmath99 respectively , these points will be exactly four vertices of @xmath95",
    ". then @xmath15 belongs to exactly 6 facets @xmath100 of the tiling , @xmath101 is the common facet of polytopes @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "does not change the property that @xmath70 .",
    "now if we orthogonally project our four parallelohedra @xmath107 onto the plane of tetrahedron @xmath105 then the face @xmath15 will project into a point @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath108 be the vector of projection of @xmath21-dimensional face of the tiling that is common to all parallelohedra incident to @xmath15 but @xmath102 .",
    "four vectors @xmath108 generates three - dimensional subspace parallel to @xmath105 and any three of these vectors are linearly independent , so upto homothety there is exactly one tetrahedron @xmath109 in the space @xmath105 such that each vector @xmath108 is the normal vector to the facet of @xmath110 that does not contain vertex @xmath111 .",
    "we claim that the gain function @xmath49 and therefore canonical scaling is defined by lengths of edges of tetrahedron @xmath110 .",
    "namely , @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , the segment @xmath113 is orthogonal both faces @xmath114 and @xmath115 , hence it is orthogonal to the facet @xmath116 . by the same argument any segment @xmath117 is orthogonal to the face @xmath101",
    "therefore each facet of @xmath110 represents the unique linear dependence of normal vectors of facets of the tiling incident to a primitive face of codimension 2 .",
    "so , @xmath118 and the first case is done",

    "the projection of the face @xmath15 is the center of this octahedron since this center is the center of symmetry of the lattice of the tiling that interchanges @xmath1 and @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , the octahedron @xmath95 is centrally symmetric with respect to projection of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath145 denotes the vector of projection of @xmath21-dimensional face correspondent to dual @xmath6-cell @xmath132 .",
    "in the same way we will denote vectors of projections of other 7 @xmath21-faces .",
    "we can assume that @xmath146 and similarly for other 3 pairs of vectors .",
    "like in the previous case we will construct a polytope such that its edges will give us normals of facets incident to @xmath15 .",
    "but unlike in previous case we will use only part of constructed vectors since there are four pairs of opposite between them .",
    "let @xmath147 be a tetrahedron whose facet are orthogonal to constructed vectors , namely , @xmath148 is orthogonal to @xmath145 , @xmath149 is orthogonal to @xmath150 , @xmath151 is orthogonal to @xmath152 , and @xmath153 is orthogonal to @xmath154 .",
    "such a tetrahedron is unique upto homothety .",
    "the edges of @xmath147 are orthogonal to the facets of the tiling incident to @xmath15 .",

    "the first one is orthogonal to @xmath145 and therefore @xmath156 and the second one is orthogonal to @xmath150 and @xmath157 .",
    "so @xmath155 is orthogonal to all four these vectors and it is parallel to the projection of normal vector to facets @xmath158 and @xmath159 of the tiling . in the same way we can prove that any edge of tetrahedron @xmath147 is parallel to normal of two facets incident to @xmath15",
    ". in particularly @xmath160 is parallel to normal vectors of @xmath161 and @xmath162 and @xmath163 is parallel to normal vectors of @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",

    "similarly we can find the value of gain function @xmath49 on any to pairs of facets incident to @xmath15 ( except opposite ) using only lengths of edges of @xmath147 . and",
    "finally we get @xmath169 the second case is done .",
    "now we have only the last case left , namely assume that dual @xmath22-cell for @xmath15 is quadrangular pyramid @xmath95 with base @xmath170 and apex @xmath1 . here",
    "vertices of the dual cell represents parallelohedra of the tiling as before .",
    "we will use similar notations as before and the general idea to prove the consistence of the cycle @xmath171 $ ] will be the same : we will construct a three - dimensional polytope with edges parallel to normal vectors to facets incident to @xmath15 .",
    "after affine transformation and orthogonal projection onto the plane of @xmath95 @xmath21-faces of the tiling incident to @xmath15 will be represented by five vectors correspondent to faces of @xmath95 .",
    "namely @xmath145 , @xmath172 , @xmath157 , @xmath154 which correspond to triangular faces of @xmath95 , and @xmath173 which corresponds to the base of @xmath95 .",
    "the only difference in that case is in the constructing desired polytope .",
    "since we have 5 vectors that should be orthogonal to its faces , there are two possibilities of such polytope ( combinatorial triangular prism or quadrangular pyramid ) and only one of these cases will lead us to gain function . to avoid undesired case",
    "we will take an arbitrary point @xmath10 in the space of pyramid @xmath95 and take four planes in this space that are orthogonal to considered vectors but @xmath173 .",
    "to finish the construction we take a plane that is orthogonal to @xmath173 and do not contain @xmath10 .",
    "we had constructed the quadrangular pyramid @xmath174 with apex @xmath10 such that its faces @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath147 are orthogonal to vectors @xmath172 , @xmath154 , @xmath157 , @xmath145 , and @xmath173 respectively .    and",
    "again edges of constructed pyramed are parallel to normals to facets incident to @xmath15 .",

    "since @xmath212 is commutative group than we trivially get that @xmath49 also gives us a homomorphism of group @xmath213 $ ] ( here @xmath214 $ ] denotes the commutant of the group @xmath72 ) to @xmath212 .",
    "this group is isomorphic to group of homologies @xmath215 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ simpconn ] given a parallelohedron @xmath1 with connected @xmath31-surface .",
    "if fundamental group @xmath211 or group of homologies @xmath215 is trivial then the voronoi conjecture @xmath69 is true for @xmath1 .    in both cases an arbitrary generic cycle @xmath61 can be represented as a product @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a cycle from commutant @xmath218 $ ] .",
    "this is true because in both cases @xmath218=\\pi_1(p_\\delta)$ ] ( and also this is trivial group in the first case ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath219 and hence @xmath70 .",
    "thus by lemma [ iffcond ] the voronoi conjecture is true for @xmath1 .",
    "now we will show how to generalize this theorem for the case of @xmath34-surface of parallelohedron @xmath1 .",
    "this theorem can be generalized in two directions .",
    "first we can consider polytopes with non - connected @xmath31- or @xmath34-surfaces . in that case",
    "the polytope @xmath1 can be represented as a direct sum of parallelohedra of smaller dimensions as it was proved in @xcite , so for both polytope summands the theorem [ simpconn ] and therefore the voronoi conjecture is true so it is true for @xmath1 .",
    "the second way of generalizing theorem [ simpconn ] is to introduce new cycles that also have gain function 1 . on the @xmath34-surface of @xmath1",
    "such cycles are `` half - belt '' cycles .    the cycle @xmath61 on @xmath35 is called _ half - belt cycle _ if its support is a combinatorial path @xmath220 $ ] such that all three facets @xmath59 belongs to the same belt of length @xmath221 .    on the @xmath31-surface @xmath32 this cycle corresponds to a path that starts on the facet @xmath80 and ends on the opposite facet @xmath222 of @xmath1 and crossing only three parallel primitive faces of codimension 2",
    "for every half - belt cycle @xmath61 we have @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath223 be the unique linear dependence of normal vectors @xmath224 to facets @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "then by definition of the gain function @xmath49 we have @xmath227    [ vorgener ] if the fundamental group @xmath228 or the group of homologies @xmath229 is generated by half - belt cycles of parallelohedron @xmath1 then the voronoi conjecture is true for @xmath1 .",
    "we can use the same arguments as in the proof of theorem [ simpconn ] . as before we can show that the gain function @xmath49 is a homomorphism of @xmath228 to @xmath212 .",
    "we only need to add that since any cycle @xmath61 can be represented as a product @xmath230 of half - belt cycles @xmath82 then @xmath70 as desired .    when we factorize a fundamental group of a manifold @xmath231 by its commutant we will get the @xmath232-homologies of @xmath231 . but in our case it can be easily generalized to the case of @xmath233-homologies .",
    "moreover we are only interested in the torsion - free part of homology group and in the case of @xmath233-homologies this property is automatically satisfied .",
    "in this section we will show that conditions of theorem [ vorgener ] are true for all three - dimensional parallelohedra .",
    "there are five combinatorial types of three - dimensional parallelohedra .",
    "two reducible parallelohedra are cube @xmath234 and hexagonal prism @xmath235 .",
    "it easy easy to see that @xmath236 is a collection of six disjoint open disks ( correspondent to faces of @xmath234 ) and @xmath237 is a collection of three disjoint open disks . in both cases it is easy to see that both fundamental groups @xmath238 and @xmath239 as well as homology groups @xmath240 and @xmath241 are trivial and conditions of both theorems [ simpconn ] ( for non - connected case ) and [ vorgener ] are true . for @xmath235 situation is a bit more interesting .",
    "so , @xmath242 is a collection of two open disks ( bases of prism ) and an open strip ( the side surface ) and @xmath243 is a collection of a disk and a mbius strip .",
    "and in that case @xmath244 it is easy to find generators for all these groups . for both fundamental and homology group of @xmath31-surface",
    "the generator is the cycle represented by single belt - cycle on side surface of @xmath235 .",
    "end for @xmath34-surface generators are represented by unique half - belt cycle of @xmath235 .",
    "three irreducible polytopes are rhombic dodecahedron @xmath245 , elongated dodecahedron @xmath246 , and truncated octahedron @xmath247 ( from left to right on the next figure ) .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    the rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron are @xmath6-primitive ( the zhitomirskii case @xcite ) since all its edges generates belts of length 6 . for such parallelohedra @xmath31-surface is just the surface of parallelohedra itself .",
    "so , @xmath248 and @xmath249 are homeomorphic to sphere @xmath250 , and @xmath251 and @xmath252 are homeomorphic to projective plane @xmath253 .",
    "so , groups @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 are trivial and we can apply theorem [ simpconn ] for these polytopes . and for @xmath34-surfaces we know that groups @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 are isomorphic to @xmath262 and they are generated by any half - belt cycle so we can apply theorem [ vorgener ] also . also , as we discussed in the remark after theorem [ vorgener ] we can consider @xmath233-homologies also . for both parallelohedra @xmath245 and @xmath247 correspondent @xmath233-homologies are trivial",
    "so we can apply the theorem [ vorgener ] for this case also .    and",
    "the last and the most interesting case is the elongated dodecahedron @xmath246 . here the manifold @xmath263 is a sphere with four cuts correspondent to four vertical edges of the middle polytope of the figure [ 3d ] . and the fundamental group @xmath264 is the free group on three letters .",
    "we can take three cycles consist of two half - belts each around some edges that we deleted as independent generators .",
    "and the homology group @xmath265 is isomorphic to @xmath266 .",
    "the manifold @xmath267 is the real projective plane with two cuts .",
    "so , fundamental group @xmath268 is generated by two cycles around cuts and arbitrary half - belt cycle but these three cycles are not independent .",
    "groups of first homologies also can be found easily using that betti number @xmath269 is @xmath94 ( to check this one can calculate the euler characteristic of @xmath267 ) .",
    "for @xmath233-homologies we have @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the torsion part of homologies group and does not affect on existence of canonical scaling . and @xmath272 is just @xmath233 . and in both case non - torsion part of group can be represented by cycle consist of two half - belt cycles around one of two cuts .",
    "so theorem [ vorgener ] can be applied in this case also .",
