    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in f - doped lafeaso with @xmath8 of @xmath9 26 k created a flurry of excitement in condensed matter research .",
    "@xcite rapidly , numerous families of fe - based superconductors such as @xmath10feas(o@xmath1f@xmath2 ) ( 1111-family , @xmath10 = rare earth ) , @xmath11fe@xmath12as@xmath12 ( 122-family , @xmath11 = ba , ca , sr , k , cs ... ) , lifeas / nafeas ( 111-family ) and fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 ( 11-family )  @xcite have been found and investigated .",
    "although the fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 chalcogenides share with their pnictogen - based cousins similar structure , based on planar layers of edge sharing [ fe(se , te)]@xmath13 tetrahedra , some significant differences were rapidly revealed . among them",
    "are the large magnetic moment ( @xmath9 2.0 - 2.5 @xmath14 ) and the double stripe magnetic ordering of the parent fe@xmath0te compound .",
    "@xcite magnetic stripes are found in other fe - based parent compounds such as bafe@xmath15as@xmath15 or lafeaso stripes in pnictides , but they are rotated by 45@xmath16 around the @xmath3-axis with respect to fe@xmath0te ,  @xcite with significantly lower magnetic moments on fe in these compound ( typically 0.4 - 1.0 @xmath14/iron  @xcite ) .    the magnetic ordering is accompanied by a structural transition ( @xmath17 ) ,  @xcite which can be progressively suppressed on substitution of isovalent se at the te 2b wyckoff position .",
    "this also results in emergence of superconductivity with a @xmath18 14 k at ambient pressure at the optimum doping .",
    "@xcite however , numerous reports have recently demonstrated that the excess of interstitial fe between the chalcogenide layers , even after doping with se , could affect both superconducting and magnetic properties , _ e.g. _ suppression of transition temperature @xmath8 or lowering shielding fraction , as well as leading to the appearance of weakly localized magnetic states .",
    "@xcite    raman spectroscopy is an ultimate noninvasive tool and can allow systematic studies of the temperature dependence of the phonon spectrum as function of se and excess of interstitial fe .",
    "for example , raman spectroscopy has proved useful in the understanding of the structural , magnetic and electronic properties of superconducting pnictides .",
    "@xcite available raman data on single crystals of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 is to date limited . in refs .   and",
    ", comparison between se - substituted and parent fe@xmath0te samples is made , but neither temperature dependence nor influence of the excess iron concentration on the lattice dynamics are discussed . in ref .  , the authors study the evolution with temperature of the raman spectra of fe@xmath19te , with a particular emphasis on the anomalously large lineshape of the te @xmath20 phonon .",
    "it is argued to originate from a peculiar spin - orbital frustration effect , that leaves unaffected the @xmath4 phonon after symmetry considerations .    in this paper , we focus mainly on this raman active @xmath3-axis polarized optical phonon in fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 , which is common to all the iron - based superconductors families , and discuss its evolution with temperature for various fe , @xmath6 , and se content , @xmath5 .",
    "we can demonstrate that contrarily to the @xmath20 mode , the observed temperature dependence is strongly affected by composition . to some extent ,",
    "the phonon behavior through the various phases transitions ( depending of the se content ) is consistent with those of the @xmath3-axis polarized fe modes reported in the other families of fe - based superconductors ( _ e.g. _ 122 and 111 ) .",
    "the narrowing of the phonon lineshape through the magnetic transition of the parent compound or the absence of renormalization through the superconducting one are for instance reported . on the other hand ,",
    "we also show that in some specific conditions , the behavior of the @xmath4 mode seriously deviates from the aforementioned one .",
    "the phonon linewidth shows an anomalous broadening in the paramagnetic state of fe@xmath0te parent compounds and an unusually strong dependence with the se concentration in the doped compounds .",
    "further anomalies , indicative of additional decay channels , are found when increasing the concentration of excess fe @xmath6 .    to try to get some insights about the influence of excess iron on the raman phonon , we have carried out a density functional theory ( dft ) _ ab initio _ calculation within the local density approximation ( lda ) of the phonon frequencies , including the effects of magnetism and fe nonstoichiometry in the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) .",
    "the measured frequencies are in good agreement with the predicted ones , including a softening with increasing fe content in fe deficient samples , but the effects of fe nonstoichiometry are poorly reproduced .",
    "recent studies of magnetic properties have revealed that excess fe induces local magnetism and low energy magnetic fluctuations ,  @xcite but these can not be treated within our dft approaches . generally speaking , whenever low - energy magnetic fluctuations are at play ,",
    "the @xmath4 phonon behavior deviates from the conventional harmonic picture and can not be reproduced within our theoretical framework .",
    "this suggests that the reported anomalies originate from coupling between the @xmath4 mode and these excitations .",
    ".[tab : tablesample]a summary of the chemical compositions obtained by edx and characteristic transitions temperatures of the various fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 samples used in this study . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the calculated frequencies are extremely sensitive to the fe excess content , which also affects strongly the magnetic moment . in the vca ,",
    "the magnetic moments and frequencies decrease monotonically with increasing fe content , up to the highest doping we calculated ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we find an almost linear increase of the @xmath4 frequency with doping , with a linear slope of @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24/@xmath6 for nsp and sp calculations , respectively .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the experimentally observed effects of fe non stoichiometry are much weaker .",
    "in parent fe@xmath25te , we have observed a clear softening and a narrowing of the @xmath4 phonon through the magnetic ordering transition at @xmath7 .",
    "such narrowing has also been reported in parent bafe@xmath15as@xmath15  @xcite and cafe@xmath15as@xmath15  @xcite through the spin - density wave ( sdw ) transition . in the latter case only , it is accompanied by a jump of the phonon frequency that can , at least partially , be explained by the sudden collapse of the unit cell along the @xmath3-axis through the transition ( such collapse does not take place in bafe@xmath15as@xmath15 ) .    on the contrary , in fe@xmath0te",
    ", the @xmath3-axis lattice parameter has been found to expand slightly through the coupled structural - magnetic transition .",
    "@xcite this certainly favors the observed softening , although one would in this case expect an abrupt jump in the phonon frequency at @xmath7 ( the structural transition is first - order ) rather than the observed smooth softening between @xmath7 and 10 k.    regarding the agreement with the calculated phonon frequencies , it has been shown for the 122 and 1111 systems that the experimental phonon frequencies are closer from those obtained with a magnetic calculation than from those where magnetism is not included , even in the paramagnetic state .",
    "@xcite this is also the case here as we get a better match with our experimental data using the sp calculation rather than the nsp one ( see sect .  [ dftcalc ] ) .    finally , as the phonon linewidth is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the excitation , its renormalization through @xmath7 reflects the changes in the coupling of the phonons to some decay channels . in the 122 arsenides ,",
    "as the sdw gap opens ,  @xcite a significant reduction of the electronic density of states at the fermi level occurs , leading to a decrease of electron - phonon coupling that reasonably accounts for the observed sharpening of the phonons .",
    "@xcite such an sdw gap opening has not yet been reported in the 11 compounds ,  @xcite but has recently been observed in arpes experiments  @xcite and is very likely responsible for the @xmath4 mode narrowing in the fe@xmath25te sample .        as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath4 fe mode that shows here",
    "the most striking doping dependence is active in all the families of fe - based superconductors .",
    "the absence of renormalization of this phonon as well as of the @xmath20 one through the superconducting transition in the doped compounds is consistent with experiments carried out on the doped 122 arsenide compounds  @xcite ( with the notable exception being the electron - doped pr@xmath2ca@xmath1fe@xmath15as@xmath15 ,  @xcite where a small hardening of the @xmath4 phonon through @xmath8 has been observed ) or on the 111 compound lifeas  @xcite , where no signature of the superconducting transition is seen either in the frequency or in the linewidth of these two modes .",
    "this is due to the fact that the superconducting gap amplitude is smaller than the phonon frequencies , hence his opening let them unaffected .",
    "the situation is similar for the 11 compounds , as the phonon frequency is much larger than the energies reported for the superconducting gap(s ) in various experiments [ 2@xmath26 2  mev ( 17 @xmath24 )  @xcite , 3.4  mev ( 27.4 @xmath24 )  @xcite or 4.6  mev ( 37 @xmath24 )  @xcite from stm , 2@xmath26 3  mev ( 24 @xmath24 ) from nmr ,  @xcite and 2@xmath266  mev ( 48 @xmath24)from specific heat  @xcite ] .",
    "we now turn to the influence of se concentration on the behavior of the @xmath4 phonon .",
    "as it is substituted into the system , we observe a weak increase of the @xmath4 phonon frequency at the lowest temperatures ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_b1 g ] b to e ) , that goes along with the reduction of the @xmath3-axis parameter reported from x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "@xcite the room temperature linewidth for this mode is only weakly dependent on the se concentration , although the fwhm clearly tends to sharpen with increasing se content .",
    "this fact is already surprising as one may have rather expected the se - substitution induced disorder to favor a broadening of the phonon lineshape instead of a narrowing .",
    "the normal state temperature dependence of the mode fwhm for different doping levels is even more puzzling . as noted in sec .",
    "[ resultsse ] , the situation appears conventional in the fe@xmath27te@xmath28se@xmath29 samples close to half doping , with a continuous narrowing of the phonon with decreasing temperature . on the contrary , as se contents are reduced the phonon broadens with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is particulary clear for the two se - free samples ( fe@xmath25te and fe@xmath30te ) , as seen in fig .",
    "6-d .    the temperature dependence of the three samples with the highest se content",
    "have successfully been fitted using a conventional anharmonic decay model ( eq .  [ e2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , looking at the fitting parameters of table  [ tab : tablefitb1 g ] , the residual - or temperature - independent - linewidth @xmath31 ( 3.4 @xmath24 ) in fe@xmath27te@xmath28se@xmath29 is comparable with the one of the temperature dependent parameter @xmath32 ( 2.1 @xmath24 ) , whereas in fe@xmath33te@xmath34se@xmath35 and fe@xmath36te@xmath37se@xmath38 we have @xmath39 10 @xmath40 .",
    "the situation is thus much closer to the one reported for pr@xmath2ca@xmath1fe@xmath15as@xmath15  @xcite than for lifeas , where the residual linewidth was always vanishingly small .",
    "@xcite this shows that in fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath41 systems , the contribution of anharmonicity to the @xmath4 phonon lifetime is not the dominant one .",
    "an additional decay channel for this phonon must therefore take over the usual anharmonic effects , and its contribution increases strongly as se content is decreased .",
    "such behavior can have at least two possible origins : electron - phonon coupling and spin - phonon coupling .",
    "in the first scenario , the increasing relative weight @xmath31 with decreasing se content can be trivially related to the increase of the electronic density of states at the fermi level @xmath42  @xcite [ as @xmath43 ) ] .",
    "this may , however , not be sufficient to account for the reported effect : electron - phonon coupling is , in principle , temperature independent and can , therefore , hardly explain the increasing linewidth of the @xmath4 phonon with decreasing temperature in the systems with the lowest se contents ( fe@xmath25te , fe@xmath44te@xmath45se@xmath46 ) .",
    "having in mind the increasing weight of magnetic excitations as se concentration decreases toward the parent compound ,  @xcite we are naturally led to suggest that spin - phonon coupling may be the additional decay channel for the phonons .",
    "the effects of excess fe discussed in the next section indeed confirm an interplay between the lattice and spin degrees of freedom in these systems .",
    "according to our calculation in sec .",
    "[ dftcalc ] , increasing the fe concentration induces a softening of the @xmath4 mode frequencies in both sp and nsp calculations .",
    "the softening rates are found to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24/@xmath6 for nsp and sp , respectively .",
    "experimentally , at low temperature , a small hardening is instead observed in the parent compounds , when going from fe@xmath25te to fe@xmath30te .  in se - substituted samples on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath97 @xmath24 softening between fe@xmath27te@xmath28se@xmath29 and fe@xmath19te@xmath47se@xmath48 @xmath4 phonon frequencies is indeed observed ( @xmath970 @xmath24/@xmath6 ) .",
    "an effect of comparable size is found when comparing the @xmath4 peak frequencies of fe@xmath27te@xmath28se@xmath29 ( @xmath49 ) and fe@xmath33te@xmath34se@xmath35 ( @xmath50 ) , with significantly different fe deficiencies ( even though the se concentrations in this case slightly differ ) .",
    "this gives a softening rate of @xmath9 66 @xmath24/@xmath6 .    in any case , the experimentally observed effects of fe nonstoichiometry are much weaker than those theoretically calculated , even considering the sp calculation where they are the smallest",
    ". one has to keep in mind that accurate comparison to the calculation is tough as the presence of excess ( @xmath51 ) fe complicates the situation .",
    "in fact , in the vca there is no qualitative difference between fe excess and deficiency , as the excess ( deficient ) charge are both located around the fe site .",
    "experimentally , however , it is known that the excess fe ions are located in the te planes , and this has qualitatively different effects , the most important being that the effective fe magnetic moment is enhanced and not reduced , due to the formation of local moments on the excess fe in the te planes .",
    "this can not be taken into account by the vca approach of treating the doping in our lda calculations .",
    "furthermore , it is important to point out that mean - field lda dft calculations can not reproduce the renormalization of the @xmath4 frequency and linewidth observed at low temperature in the fe - rich systems , which are discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ exp_fe_undoped ] that in the fe@xmath30te crystal , we are not able to observe clearly the effect of the magnetic transition on the phonons . a small softening has been seen ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3b]-d ) , but no narrowing of the line shape . in the se - substituted system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , excess iron , in addition to a decrease in @xmath8 , induces large effects on both frequency and lineshape of the phonons .",
    "the strongest effect occurs close to 50% se content , with a large softening and broadening of the @xmath4 phonon below @xmath5235 k , well above @xmath8 . to our knowledge",
    ", no phase transition has been reported in this temperature range for this doping level , but the occurrence of short - range magnetic fluctuations has been reported .",
    "@xcite in the undoped case with low excess iron concentration , it has been shown that a low energy gap in the spin - wave excitation spectrum opens when entering the magnetic state .",
    "@xcite increasing the excess iron concentration , this gap is filled up with low - energy spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    in both doped and undoped cases , one effect of excess iron is , therefore , to induce low energy magnetic fluctuations in a temperature range at which we also observe a relative broadening of the @xmath4 phonon , _",
    "i.  e. _ , a decrease of its lifetime .",
    "this reinforces the point we made at the end of sec .",
    "[ disc ] , indicating that the additional damping for the @xmath4 mode may actually originate from its coupling to magnetic excitations .",
    "we have carried out a systematic study of the lattice dynamics in the fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath41 system , focusing more particularly on the @xmath3-axis polarized fe @xmath4 mode . in parent compounds , unlike other systems such as bafe@xmath15as@xmath15 or lifeas , a nonconventional broadening of this mode is observed as temperature decreases , and a clear signature of the sdw gap opening is observed . as se is substituted to te , the temperature dependence of this modes smoothly evolves toward a more regular situation , with the @xmath4 phonon showing conventional anharmonic decay . a good agreement between the observed phonon frequencies and a first - principles calculation including the effects of magnetic ordering",
    "the temperature dependence of the phonon linewidth , as well as the effects induced by the fe nonstoichiometry in these compounds , revealed a peculiar coupling of this mode to magnetic fluctuations in the fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath41 system and can , to date , not be satisfactorily reproduced within state - of - the - art computational approaches .",
